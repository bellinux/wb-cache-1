5|$|In 23BC Emperor Augustus became gravely ill and his {{possible}} death {{threatened to}} plunge the Roman world into chaos again. Historians generally <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{during this time}} {{that the question of}} Augustus' heir became most acute, and while Augustus had seemed to indicate that Agrippa and Marcellus would carry on his position in the event of his death, the ambiguity of succession became Augustus' chief problem.|$|E
5|$|The {{book has}} been reprinted many times, in at least 16 English {{versions}} and in Spanish, Chinese and German editions. While some critics consider Newby's Love and War in the Apennines a better book, A Short Walk was the book that made him well-known, and critics <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> both understated and very funny in an old-school British way.|$|E
5|$|Waylon Smithers {{is offered}} {{a job at the}} Globex Corporation. When he refuses, the offer is passed down to Homer, the next-longest-employed {{individual}} at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. He informs his family that the new job pays better and provides free health-care for the family, but involves moving to Cypress Creek. The Simpson family initially opposes the move, but after they watch a promotional video about the planned community, they <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> much better than Springfield. Abandoning their house, the Simpsons pack up and leave town.|$|E

5|$|The {{change in}} {{partners}} leads the Simpson family to begin arguing and aggressively competing against one another. The tournament takes place, {{and in the}} stands, are leading tennis professionals Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras, Venus Williams, and Serena Williams. At the tournament, Homer ditches Lisa for Venus Williams. In response, Marge replaces Bart with Serena Williams as her partner. Ultimately, Serena and Venus replace Marge and Homer with Sampras and Agassi, respectively. This forces the family {{to go back to}} the bench and resume their normal places in the family. As they enjoy the exhibition of top-class tennis, they <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> better to watch things than to do things, and Homer offers to buy the family dinner with money he took from Sampras' wallet.|$|E
5|$|The Manipuri pony is a {{breed of}} pony {{developed}} in India. Experts disagree on its exact origin, {{although they do}} <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> an ancient breed, possibly developed from either the Tibetan pony or a cross between the Mongolian Wild Horse and the Arabian. First mentioned in written chronicles in 1584, Manipuri ponies were used as cavalry horses throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, they were in demand by the British for use as polo ponies. Breed numbers have dwindled, however, mainly due to exports, and today the population is very low. In 2007, a genetic study {{was conducted on the}} Manipuri and four other Indian equine breeds. The Manipuri was shown to be genetically close to three other Indian pony breeds, but genetically more distant from the Marwari, the sole Indian horse breed in the study. The Manipuri pony was originally bred for polo and military usage, and today is bred mainly for playing polo and racing, although it is also in demand for military transport use.|$|E

25|$|Many reviewers {{compared}} the album with Isis' seminal previous record, Oceanic, often noting a 'progression'. Turner himself stated: “I do <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a natural progression from Oceanic. It absolutely is an evolution and a step forward.” Sonically, compared with Oceanic, “the drums and vocals are submerged, the riffs intricately monolithic” {{and there is}} an increased prominence lent to electronics and synths; this led to it being characterised as “a little more polished”.|$|E
25|$|In general, the Mac Mini {{has been}} praised as a {{relatively}} affordable computer with a solid range of features. However, many also <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> relatively costly for a computer aimed at the lower segment of the market. It is possible to buy small computers at the same price with faster processors, better graphics card, more memory, and more storage. The small size has made the Mac Mini particularly popular as a home theater solution. In addition, its size and reliability has helped keep resale values high.|$|E

25|$|News grows even grimmer as Weidling {{reports to}} Hitler {{there are no}} {{reserves}} left, and Mohnke reports that the Red Army is only 300 to 400 metres from the Reich Chancellery. Hitler reassures the officers that General Walther Wenck's 12th Army will save them. After Hitler leaves the conference room, Weidling firmly asks if it is truly possible for Wenck to attack; the generals all <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> impossible, but still resolve to never surrender. After midnight, Hitler dictates his {{last will and testament}} to Traudl, before marrying Eva Braun. Hitler orders Goebbels to leave Berlin, but Goebbels refuses. The following morning, Weidling reports that not only was Wenck not able to attack, all of their remaining armies are now incapable of any meaningful action, and that the Reich {{is no more than a}} few hours away from total defeat. Finally accepting that there is no hope, Hitler decides to kill himself before he can be captured.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{a mysterious}} new witch comes into play, being {{revealed}} to be Crowley's mother, Rowena. Also, the angel Hannah goes back to Heaven so that her vessel can have her life back. A large focus of the season is Dean's quest to overcome the Mark of Cain and have it removed if possible. After the Mark causes him to break Charlie's arm, Sam suggests that Dean {{has the ability to}} at least partially control the Mark, but only if he can control himself. New hope for ridding Dean of the Mark comes when Charlie unearths the Book of the Damned. Sam needs help in reading and using this powerful tome, and turns to Rowena for help, keeping the entire thing a secret from Dean. He requests help from Charlie, too, who decodes the text but is murdered by the Steins, a family that has secretly controlled much of history. After massacring the Steins, nearly killing Castiel and getting another hunter killed, Dean starts despairing of being free of the Mark, causing him to turn to Death for help. Death proposes putting Dean in isolation away the Earth, but insists Dean must kill Sam, who otherwise would work to bring Dean back. Sam and Dean both <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{for the good of the}} world. At the last moment however, Dean seemingly kills Death instead to save Sam. Oblivious to the dangers, Rowena successfully casts the spell to remove the Mark and unleashes the Darkness, a primordial evil that had been kept away by the Mark. Rowena also places Castiel under a spell so he attacks Crowley as she escapes with the Book of the Damned.|$|E

500|$|Matthew, Mark, and Luke {{are known}} as the Synoptic Gospels, from the Greek σύν (syn [...] "together") and ὄψις (opsis [...] "view").

Scholars generally <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> impossible to find any direct literary relationship between the Synoptic Gospels and the Gospel of John. While the flow of some events (such as Jesus' baptism, transfiguration, crucifixion and interactions with the apostles) are shared among the Synoptic Gospels, incidents such as the transfiguration do not appear in John, which also differs on other matters, such as the Cleansing of the Temple.|$|E
500|$|Scholars have debated Calvin's {{view of the}} Jews and Judaism. Some {{have argued}} that Calvin was the least anti-semitic among all the major reformers of his time, {{especially}} in comparison to Martin Luther. Others have argued that Calvin was firmly within the anti-semitic camp. Scholars <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> important to distinguish between Calvin's views toward the biblical Jews and his attitude toward contemporary Jews. In his theology, Calvin does not differentiate between God's covenant with Israel and the New Covenant. He stated, [...] "all {{the children of the}} promise, reborn of God, who have obeyed the commands by faith working through love, have belonged to the New Covenant since the world began." [...] Nevertheless, he was a covenant theologian and argued that the Jews are a rejected people who must embrace Jesus to re-enter the covenant.|$|E
