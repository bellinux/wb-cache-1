5000|$|As {{a general}} rule, words of Spanish origin are written <b>and</b> <b>spelled</b> using Spanish orthography ( [...] , [...] ). Words of local (Philippine languages) origin are written <b>and</b> <b>spelled</b> using local orthography only when those words are {{pronounced}} in the local manner (manok, kanon). Otherwise, words of local origin are written <b>and</b> <b>spelled</b> in the native manner along Spanish spelling rules (jendeh, cogon).|$|R

5|$|By the 15th century, English {{was back}} in fashion among all classes, though much changed; the Middle English form showed many signs of French influence, both in {{vocabulary}} <b>and</b> <b>spelling.</b> During the English Renaissance, many words were coined from Latin and Greek origins. Modern English has extended this custom of flexibility, {{when it comes to}} incorporating words from different languages. Thanks {{in large part to the}} British Empire, the English language is the world's unofficial lingua franca.|$|E
5|$|In {{a pair of}} studies, high-functioning {{children}} with autism aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary <b>and</b> <b>spelling.</b> Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals {{are more likely to}} overestimate what their audience comprehends.|$|E
5|$|Rumours also {{surfaced}} in 1900, after Albert Victor's death, of {{his association with}} another former Gaiety girl, Maude Richardson (birth name: Louisa Lancey), and that the royal family had attempted to pay her off. In 2002, letters purported to have been sent by Albert Victor to his solicitor referring to a payoff made to Richardson of £200 were sold at Bonhams auction house in London. Owing to discrepancies in the dates <b>and</b> <b>spelling</b> of the letters, one historian has suggested they could be forgeries.|$|E

5|$|The game {{features}} an integrated chat system {{which is available}} only after completing a basic test of English grammar <b>and</b> <b>spelling.</b> There are many chat channels, including a channel in which all chat must follow the syllabic conventions of English haiku. Most of the chat channels are moderated; those who violate the chat rules are banned. Players can also send messages and gift packages to each other in-game, and the official Kingdom of Loathing forums are another active venue for discussion among players.|$|E
5|$|Modern English grammar is {{the result}} of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European {{dependent}} marking pattern with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order, to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection, a fairly fixed SVO word order and a complex syntax. Modern English relies more on auxiliary verbs and word order for the expression of complex tenses, aspect and mood, as well as passive constructions, interrogatives and some negation. Despite noticeable variation among the accents and dialects of English used in different countries and regions – in terms of phonetics and phonology, and sometimes also vocabulary, grammar <b>and</b> <b>spelling</b> – English-speakers from around the world are able to communicate with one another with relative ease.|$|E
5|$|The Tribal Hidage {{has been}} of great {{importance}} to historians {{since the middle of}} the 19th century, partly because it mentions territories unrecorded in other documents. Attempts to link all the names in the list with modern places are highly speculative and all resulting maps are treated with caution. Three different versions (or recensions) of the Tribal Hidage have survived, two of which resemble each other: one dates from the 11th century and is part of a miscellany of works; another is contained in a 17th-century Latin treatise; the third version, which has survived in six mediaeval manuscripts, has many omissions <b>and</b> <b>spelling</b> variations. All three versions appear {{to be based on the}} same lost manuscript: historians have been unable to establish a date for the original compilation. The Tribal Hidage has been used to construct theories about the political organisation of the Anglo-Saxons, and to give an insight into the Mercian state and its neighbours at a time when Mercia held hegemony over a number of other peoples. It has been used to support theories regarding the origin and location of the tribes in the list and the way in which the tribes were systematically assessed and ruled by others. Some historians have proposed that the Tribal Hidage is not a list of peoples but of administrative areas.|$|E
5000|$|Two mixes of {{the song}} have been released, one which fades out, and one which does not (cold end). The cold end version is on the {{original}} 7" [...] and on the 1988 CD re-release of Speak <b>and</b> <b>Spell</b> in Europe, while the American Speak <b>and</b> <b>Spell</b> (<b>and</b> all singles compilations containing the song) has the fade-out version.
