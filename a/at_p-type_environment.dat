A low tunneling resistance for the (p-type) Si:H/(n-type) ZnO {{part of the}} junction requires deposition of Si:H with a high hydrogen dilution rate R-H> 40 resulting in a highly doped microcrystalline (mu c) Si:H layer. Such a mu c-Si:H layer if deposited directly on a Si wafer yields a surface recombination velocity of S approximate to 180 cm/s. Using the same layer {{as part of a}} (p-type) c-Si/Si:H/ZnO:Al back contact in a solar cell results in an open circuit voltage V-OC= 640 mV and a fill factor FF= 80 %. Insertion of an undoped amorphous (i) a-Si:H layer between the mu c-Si:H and the wafer leads to a further decrease of S and, for the solar cells, to an increase of V-OC. However, if the thickness of this intrinsic layer exceeds a threshold value of 4 - 5 nm, resistive losses degrade the fill factor FF of the solar cells. Temperature dependent measurements of the contact resistance unveil activation energies in a range of 0. 49 - 0. 65 eV, which we attribute to the valence band offset between a-Si:H and c-Si.

Due to the addition of 6 % Al the active hole concentration in the HBT base layer, deduced from Hall measurements, is increased from 1. 5 10 19 to 3. 8 10 19 cm - 3. Moreover, an In-grading within the base layer results in an intrinsic electric field of about 5. 4 kV/cm. A high dc current gain of β = 35 is provided <b>at</b> a high <b>p-type</b> doping level. First HBT devices exhibit a current gain cut-off frequency of fT = 117 GHz and an unilateral gain cut-off frequency of 90 GHz (not de-embedded) ...|$|R

Sensor array, operating upon sinusoidal temperature profile over a temperature range of 240 – 300 °C, is comprised of nanocrystalline TiO 2 :Cr (0. 1 – 10 at. % Cr) semiconductors switching from n-type to <b>p-type</b> <b>at</b> about 1 at. % Cr. Electrical resistance responses to reducing and oxidizing gases such as NO, NO 2, H 2, CH 4, C 3 H 8 (0 – 3000 ppm) are dynamically recorded and compared {{in order to assess}} cross-sensitivity as well as humidity interference. Theoretical model developed for simple gas-solid interactions is extended to hydrogen...|$|R
