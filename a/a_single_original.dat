The entire complex {{is thought to be}} around 140 parsecs distant. L183, also referred to as L134N, is home to several infrared sources, indicating pre-stellar sources thought to present the first known observation of the contraction phase between cloud cores and prestellar cores. The core is split into three regions, with a combined mass of around 25 solar masses.|$|E
5|$|A single light novel {{written by}} Mako Komao and {{illustrated}} by the manga's artist was published by MediaWorks under their Dengeki Bunko imprint in January 2006.

The anime aired in Japan on TV Tokyo between January and March 2006; the OVA was released in October 2006. A visual novel was created based on the series for the PlayStation 2 and was released in March 2006. Seven Seas Entertainment licensed the manga series for English-language publication in North America and released the five volumes between December 2006 and March 2008. Media Blasters licensed the anime series, including the OVA, and released three DVD volumes between June and October 2007 with English-subtitles.

25|$|Whereas a {{gene family}} (several tightly linked genes {{performing}} similar or identical functions) arises by duplication of <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>original</b> gene, {{this is usually}} {{not the case with}} supergenes. In a supergene some of the constituent genes have quite distinct functions, so they must have come together under selection. This process might involve suppression of crossing-over, translocation of chromosome fragments and possibly occasional cistron duplication. That crossing-over can be suppressed by selection has been known for many years.|$|E
25|$|Common ancestry between organisms of {{different}} species arises during speciation, in which new species are established {{from a single}} ancestral population. Organisms which share a more recent common ancestor are more closely related. The most recent common ancestor of all currently living organisms is the last universal ancestor, which lived about 3.9 billion years ago. The two earliest evidences for life on Earth are graphite found to be biogenic in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in western Greenland and microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia. All currently living organisms on Earth share a common genetic heritage (universal common descent), with each being the descendant from <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>original</b> species, though the suggestion of substantial horizontal gene transfer during early evolution has led to questions about monophyly of life.|$|E

2500|$|Subsequent {{excavations}} by Grimes in 1957 re-interpreted {{this feature}} {{to be an}} earlier Iron Age enclosure dating to approximately 250 BC, with Iron Age pottery found within the primary fill. It was therefore speculated that the visible interruptions {{have been made by}} post Medieval ploughing.

There is also evidence of <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>original</b> west facing entrance currently discernible as a [...] wide gap in the enclosure boundary. The straight southeastern side of the enclosure is formed by a ditch that is truncated by the main hillfort boundary, and this again has been interpreted as further evidence that the linear ditch and contiguous enclosure pre-date the main hillfort.|$|E
2500|$|The French medievalist Joseph Bédier {{thought all}} the Tristan legends could {{be traced to}} <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>{{original}}</b> poem, adapted by Thomas of Brittany into French from an original Cornish or Breton source. He dubbed this hypothetical original the [...] "Ur-Tristan", and wrote his still-popular Romance of Tristan and Iseult {{as an attempt to}} reconstruct what this might have been like. In all likelihood, Common Branch versions reflect an earlier form of the story; accordingly, Bédier relied heavily on Eilhart, Béroul and Gottfried von Strassburg, and incorporated material from other versions to make a cohesive whole. Some scholars still consider Bédier's argument convincing. A new English translation of Bédier's Roman de Tristan et Iseut (1900) by Edward J. Gallagher was published in 2013 by Hackett Publishing Company. A translation by Hilaire Belloc, first published in 1913, was republished in 2005.|$|E

[...] In turn, Gulutzan signed rookie goaltenders Daniel Manzato and Kevin LaLande, as well as signing twins and former NHLers Chris and Peter Ferraro. [...] Two games into the season, Mike McBain announced his retirement and Peter Ferraro was named as his replacement as captain.
