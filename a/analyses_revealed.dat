5|$|Despite {{a similar}} overall appearance, A.hygrometricus {{is not related}} to the true earthstars of genus Geastrum, {{although}} historically, they have been taxonomically confused. The species was first described by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1801 as Geastrum hygrometricus. In 1885, Andrew P. Morgan proposed that differences in microscopic characteristics warranted {{the creation of a new}} genus Astraeus distinct from Geastrum; this opinion was not universally accepted by later authorities. Several Asian populations formerly thought to be A.hygrometricus were renamed in the 2000s once phylogenetic <b>analyses</b> <b>revealed</b> they were unique Astraeus species, including A.asiaticus and A.odoratus. Research has revealed the presence of several bioactive chemical compounds in the fruit bodies. North American field guides typically rate A.hygrometricus as inedible.|$|E

2500|$|Studies of inter-nest {{pheromone}} trail networks {{maintained by}} super-colonies of Argentine ants (...) {{have shown that}} different colonies establish networks with very similar topologies. [...] Insights from these <b>analyses</b> <b>revealed</b> that these networks – which are used to guide workers transporting brood, workers and food between nests – are formed through a pruning process, in which individual ants initially create a complex network of trails, which are then refined to eliminate extraneous edges, resulting in a shorter, more efficient inter-nest network.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} indicates that materialistic {{women are more likely}} to want to alter their bodies (Henderson-King 2 ̆ 6 Brooks, 2009). This study focuses specifically on the relationship between materialism and body hair removal. We collected information about the frequency of body hair removal, reasons for hair removal, and materialism (Richins 2 ̆ 6 Dawson, 1992). Findings indicate that males and females do not significantly differ on materialist values. Correlational <b>analyses</b> <b>reveal</b> that for women, materialism is related to frequency of hair removal for several body sites; for men, however, materialism was related to body hair removal for only a single site. Qualitative <b>analyses</b> <b>reveal</b> that men who are more materialistic also report fewer health-related (intrinsic) reasons for hair removal. For women who are more materialistic, <b>analyses</b> <b>reveal</b> that they provide more normative (extrinsic) reasons for hair removal...|$|R

2500|$|Like all Big Five {{personality}} traits, {{the roots}} of the modern concept of agreeableness can be traced to a 1936 study by Gordon Allport and Henry S. Odbert. Seven years later, Raymond Cattell published a cluster analysis of the thousands of personality-related words identified by Allport and Odbert. The clusters identified in this study served as a foundation for Cattell's further attempts to identify fundamental, universal, human personality factors. He eventually settled on 16 personality factors through the use of factor analysis. Further factor <b>analyses</b> <b>revealed</b> five higher-order, or [...] "global", factors to encompass these 16. Although labelled [...] "independence" [...] by Cattell, a global factor defined by high scores on the E, H, L, and Q1 factors of the 16PF Questionnaire was an early precursor to the modern concept of agreeableness.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, a mtDNA {{analysis}} of extinct eastern Beringian wolves showed that two ancient wolves from the Ukraine dated 30,000 YBP and 28,000 YBP and the 33,000 YBP Altai dog {{had the same}} sequence as six Beringian wolves, indicating a common maternal ancestor. In 2013, a DNA study of the Altai dog deposited the sequence in GenBank with a classification of Canis lupus familiaris (dog). [...] "The <b>analyses</b> <b>revealed</b> that the unique haplotype of the Altai dog is {{more closely related to}} modern dogs and prehistoric New World canids than it is to contemporary wolves... This preliminary analysis affirms the conclusion that the Altai specimen is likely an ancient dog with shallow divergence from ancient wolves. These results suggest a more ancient history of the dog outside of the Middle East or East Asia." [...] The haplotype groups closest to the Altai dog included such diverse breeds as the Tibetan mastiff, Newfoundland, Chinese crested, cocker spaniel and Siberian husky.|$|E
2500|$|In hens, {{tamarind}} {{has been}} found to lower cholesterol in their serum, and in the yolks of the eggs they laid. Due to a lack of available human clinical trials, there is insufficient evidence to recommend tamarind for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia or diabetes. Different parts of tamarind (T. indica) are recognized for their various medicinal properties. A previous study reported that the seed, leaf, leaf veins, fruit pulp and skin extracts of tamarind possessed high phenolic content and antioxidant activities. The presence of lupanone and lupeol, [...] catechin, epicatechin, quercetin and isorhamnetin [...] in the leaf extract could have contributed towards the diverse range of the medicinal activities. On the other hand, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) <b>analyses</b> <b>revealed</b> that tamarind seeds contained catechin, procyanidin B2, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, chloramphenicol, myricetin, morin, quercetin, apigenin and kaempferol. The treatment of tamarind leaves on liver HepG2 cells significantly regulated the expression of genes and proteins involved with consequential impact on the coagulation system, cholesterol biosynthesis, xenobiotic metabolism signaling and antimicrobial response.|$|E

2500|$|Nursing {{professionals}} work in {{a stressful}} environment. According to a report conducted at Lehigh Valley Hospital and Health Network (LVHHN), nurses {{are at high risk}} for chronic burnout and stress. The nurse's roles are regarded as stress-filled based upon physical labor, human suffering, work hours, staffing, and interpersonal relationships. Work stress and burnout are significant concerns on both an individualistic and an organizational level. On an individualistic level, stress symptoms can contribute to health problems such as high blood pressure and diabetes. On an organizational level, work stress may lead to absenteeism and turnover, which impedes on the quality of care. According to a 2016 National Healthcare Retention & RN Staffing Report published by NSI Nursing Solutions, the national average turnover rate among nurses is 17.2%, a 0.8% increase from 2014. During the study, 27 nurses voluntarily participated in an 8-week-stress-reduction program called Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). Data <b>analyses</b> <b>revealed</b> that the MBSR program had significant benefits that could be categorized into two. “The early weeks of the training program conveyed that benefits were related to increased relaxation, slowing down, feeling a sense of peace, and learning to be in the present moment." [...] Results in the late weeks of the training program were linked to self-acceptance, self-awareness and self-care.|$|E
