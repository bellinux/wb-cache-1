And any man who tries to stigmatize the Australian {{community}} as racist because they want to preserve this country for the white race is doing our nation great harm... I reject, in conscience, the idea that Australia should or ever can become a multi-racial society and survive.|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{out against}} homophobia, Radcliffe began filming public service {{announcements}} in 2009 for The Trevor Project, promoting awareness of gay teen suicide prevention. He first learned of the organisation while working on Equus on Broadway in 2008 and has contributed financially to it. [...] "I have always hated <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> not tolerant of gay men or lesbians or bisexuals. Now I am in the very fortunate position where I can actually help or do something about it," [...] {{he said in a}} 2010 interview. In the same interview, he spoke of the importance of public figures advocating for equal rights. Radcliffe received The Trevor Project's Hero Award in 2011 for his contributions.|$|E

[...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic believed that the documentary served its purpose well. [...] "It will convince <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> on the fence about going out to see the 2006 tour {{to go ahead and}} buy those expensive tickets already," [...] he added.|$|E

2500|$|During the 2008 presidential election, {{when asked}} if the Zionist cause is just and has succeeded, McCain responded, [...] "I think so. I'm a student of history and <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> {{familiar}} with the history of the Jewish people and with the Zionist idea can't help but admire those who established the Jewish homeland. I think it's remarkable that Zionism has been in the middle of wars and great trials and it has held fast to the ideals of democracy and social justice and human rights. I think that the State of Israel remains under significant threat from terrorist organizations as well as the continued advocacy of the Iranians to wipe Israel off the map." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since its foundation, the Treaties {{sought to}} {{enable people to}} pursue their life goals in any country through free movement. Reflecting the {{economic}} nature of the project, the European Community originally focused upon free movement of workers: as a [...] "factor of production". However, from the 1970s, this focus shifted towards developing a more [...] "social" [...] Europe. Free movement was increasingly based on [...] "citizenship", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. This means the basic [...] "worker" [...] rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, a [...] "worker" [...] is <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, [...] "under the direction of another person" [...] for [...] "remuneration". A job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker. For example, in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community, which provided for everyone's material needs irrespective of their contributions. The Court of Justice held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay, {{so long as there}} was at least an [...] "indirect quid pro quo" [...] for the work he did. Having [...] "worker" [...] status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and employers, in access to employment, tax, and social security rights. By contrast a citizen, who is [...] "any person having the nationality of a Member State" [...] (TFEU article 20(1)), has rights to seek work, vote in local and European elections, but more restricted rights to claim social security. In practice, free movement has become politically contentious as nationalist political parties have manipulated fears about immigrants taking away people's jobs and benefits (paradoxically at the same time). Nevertheless, practically [...] "all available research finds little impact" [...] of [...] "labour mobility on wages and employment of local workers".|$|E

50|$|The book {{begins by}} {{examining}} {{the role that the}} Homeric Epics played in antiquity - namely that <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> considered educated at the time learned to read and write, and they did so by studying the Odyssey and Iliad.

60|$|But somehow, in {{the most}} unaccountable way, I had {{suddenly}} become nervous. There was no particular reason why I should be, beyond the ordinary reasons which surround the Central African traveller, and yet I undoubtedly was. If {{there is one thing}} more than another of which I have the most complete and entire scorn and disbelief, it is of presentiments, and yet here I was all of a sudden filled with and possessed by a most undoubted presentiment of approaching evil. I would not give way to it, however, although I felt the cold perspiration stand out upon my forehead. I would not arouse the others. Worse and worse I grew, my pulse fluttered like a dying man's, my nerves thrilled with the horrible sense of impotent terror which <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> subject to nightmare will be familiar with, but still my will triumphed over my fears, and I lay quiet (for I was half sitting, half lying, in the bow of the canoe), only turning my face so as to command a view of Umslopogaas and the two Wakwafi who were sleeping alongside of and beyond me.|$|E
60|$|Lord Northbrook’s report when in {{due time}} it came, engaged the prime minister’s anxious consideration, but {{it could not be}} carried further. What the Powers might agree to, {{parliament}} would not look at. The situation was one of the utmost delicacy and danger, as <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> aware of the diplomatic embarrassments of it knows. An agreement with France about the Suez Canal came to nothing. A conference upon finance came to nothing. Bismarck was out of humour with England, partly from his dislike of certain exalted English personages and influences at his own court, partly because it suited him that France and England should be bad friends, partly because, as he complained, whenever he tried to found a colony, we closed in upon him. He preached a sermon on do ut des, and while scouting the idea of any real differences with this country, he hinted that if we could not accommodate him in colonial questions, he might not find it in his power to accommodate us in European questions. Mr. Gladstone declared for treating every German claim in an equitable spirit, but said we had our own colonial communities to consider.|$|E
6000|$|As to the {{particular}} cases adduced, we are so perfectly fair-minded as {{to be willing to}} help your case as far as we can. You are quite mistaken in supposing that <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> acquainted with the possibilities of physical science will undertake categorically to deny that water may be turned into wine. Many very competent judges are already inclined to think that the bodies, which we have hitherto called elementary, are really composite arrangements of the particles of a uniform primitive matter. Supposing that view to be correct, {{there would be no more}} theoretical difficulty about turning water into alcohol, ethereal and colouring matters, than there is, at this present moment, any practical difficulty in working other such miracles; as when we turn sugar into alcohol, carbonic acid, glycerine, and succinic acid; or transmute gas-refuse into perfumes rarer than musk and dyes richer than Tyrian purple. If the so-called [...] "elements," [...] oxygen and hydrogen, which compose water, are aggregates of the same ultimate particles, or physical units, as those which enter into the structure of the so-called element [...] "carbon," [...] it is obvious that alcohol and other substances, composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, may be produced by a rearrangement of some of the units of oxygen and hydrogen into the [...] "element" [...] carbon, and their synthesis with the rest of the oxygen and hydrogen.|$|E
