500|$|Each level {{starts with}} a few large asteroids {{drifting}} in various directions on the screen. Objects wrap around screen edges – for instance, an asteroid that drifts off {{the top edge of}} the screen reappears at the bottom and continues moving in the same direction. As the player shoots asteroids, they break into smaller asteroids that move faster and are more difficult to hit. Smaller asteroids are also worth more points. Two flying saucers appear periodically on the screen; the [...] "big saucer" [...] shoots randomly and poorly, while the [...] "small saucer" [...] fires frequently at the ship. After reaching a score of 40,000, only the small saucer appears. As the player's score increases, the <b>angle</b> <b>range</b> of the shots from the small saucer diminishes until the saucer fires extremely accurately. Once the screen has been cleared of all asteroids and flying saucers, a new set of large asteroids appears, thus starting the next level. The game gets harder as the number of asteroids increases until after the score reaches a range between 40,000 and 60,000. The player starts with 3 lives after a coin is inserted and gains an extra life per 10,000 points. When the player loses all their lives, the game ends.|$|E

30|$|The {{output of}} the ANN is the class of the sample {{presented}} in the input layer. In this work, samples were classified into four classes. Each class covers a range of 45 °. For instance, class 1 (blue) is centered at 0 ° and represents orientation <b>angles</b> <b>ranging</b> from 157.5 ° to 22.5 °, class 2 (green) is centered at 45 ° and represents orientation <b>angles</b> <b>ranging</b> from 22.5 ° to 67.5 °, class 3 (orange) is centered at 135 ° and represents orientation <b>angles</b> <b>ranging</b> from 157.5 ° to 112.5 °, and class 4 (red) is centered at 90 ° and represents orientation <b>angles</b> <b>ranging</b> from 67.5 ° to 112.5 °. Thus, the output layer of the ANN has four neurons.

40|$|Purpose: The tibial drill-guide angle in {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction influences the tunnel placement and graft-tunnel force, and is potentially associated with post-operative tunnel widening. This study aimed to {{examine the effect of}} the drill-guide angle on the stress redistribution at the tibial tunnel aperture after anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction. Methods: A validated finite element model of human knee joint was used. The tibial tunnel with drill-guide <b>angle</b> <b>ranging</b> from 30 ° to 75 ° was investigated. The post-operative stress redistribution in tibia under the compressive, valgus, rotational and complex loadings was analysed. Results: Compressive loading played a leading role on the stress redistribution at intra-articular tibial tunnel aperture. After ACL reconstruction, stress concentration occurred in the anterior and posterior regions of tunnel aperture while stress reduction occurred in the lateral and posteromedial regions under the compressive loading. Stress redistribution was partially alleviated by using the drill-guide <b>angle</b> <b>ranging</b> from 55 ° to 65 °. Conclusions: The present study quantified the effect of bone tunnel drill-guide angle on the post-operative stress redistribution. This phenomenon potentially contributed to tunnel widening.

Many manufacturers of projection screens thus define the viewing angle as the angle at which the luminance of the image is exactly half of the maximum. With LCD screens, some manufacturers have opted to measure the contrast ratio, and report the viewing angle as the angle where the contrast ratio exceeds 5:1 or 10:1, giving minimally acceptable viewing conditions.|$|E
