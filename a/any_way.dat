5|$|Conscientious objectors (COs) {{refuse to}} {{participate}} in military service because of belief or religious training. During wartime, this stance conflicts with conscription efforts. Those willing to accept non-combatant roles, such as medical personnel, are accommodated. There are few legal options for draftees who cannot cooperate with the military in <b>any</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E

5|$|He {{then used}} a {{hypothesis}} of local realism {{to conclude that}} the other particle had these properties already determined. The principle he proposed is that if it is possible to determine what the answer to a position or momentum measurement would be, without in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> disturbing the particle, then the particle actually has values of position or momentum.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, Einstein {{returned}} {{to the question of}} quantum mechanics. He considered how a measurement on one of two entangled particles would affect the other. He noted, along with his collaborators, that by performing different measurements on the distant particle, either of position or momentum, different properties of the entangled partner could be discovered without disturbing it in <b>any</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
5|$|The film {{begins with}} a prologue of the young Portuguese Jesuit priest Cristóvão Ferreira {{witnessing}} the mortal torture of Japanese converts he {{has been trying to}} bring to the Christian faith.

5|$|Wright rarely played {{live outside}} of Pink Floyd {{compared}} to the other members. Along with Gilmour, he played in 1970 on Barrett's second solo album, Barrett, and helped with its production. He later recalled working on the album as a way of helping Barrett in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> possible. He guested at a concert by Sutherland Brothers & Quiver in 1974 at Newcastle Polytechnic.|$|E
5|$|Although Rome {{at first}} rejoiced at {{the demise of}} Sejanus, the city quickly plunged into more {{extensive}} trials, as Tiberius persecuted all those who could in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> be tied to the schemes of Sejanus or had courted his friendship. The Senatorial ranks were purged; the hardest hit were those families with political ties to the Julians. Even the imperial magistracy was not exempted from Tiberius' wrath. Arrests and executions were now supervised by Naevius Sutorius Macro. The political turmoil continued until the death of Tiberius in AD 37, after which he was succeeded by Caligula.|$|E
5|$|An {{occupation}} of the pier was started by ten activists on the designated closure date. The campaign was boosted {{by the appearance of}} Chow Yun-fat early on the morning of 28 April to sign the petition, and to appeal pre-emptively to the police not to hurt protesters. Some activists, like Chu Hoi-dick, {{have been involved in the}} Star Ferry pier protest, and took turns to maintain a round-the-clock presence. Leung Chun-yiu spent three nights a week at the site, despite working a full-time job, vowing to block the demolition non-violently in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> he could.|$|E

5|$|Biology {{has largely}} {{rejected}} the idea that evolution is guided in <b>any</b> <b>way,</b> but the evolution of some features is indeed facilitated by the genes of the developmental-genetic toolkit studied in evolutionary developmental biology. An example {{is the development of}} wing pattern in some species of Heliconius butterfly, which have independently evolved similar patterns. These butterflies are Müllerian mimics of each other, so natural selection is the driving force, but their wing patterns, which arose in separate evolutionary events, are controlled by the same genes.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{investigates the}} murder of a {{motorcycle}} dispatch-rider and the theft of his top-secret documents by a motorcycle-riding assassin. The rider was en route from SHAPE, the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, then located in Versailles, to his base, Station F, in Saint-Germain in France. Since Bond is already in Paris, his superior, M, sends him to assist in the investigation in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> he can. Bond disguises himself as a dispatch-rider and follows the same journey to Station F as the previous rider: as expected, the assassin attempts to kill Bond. Bond, however, is ready and kills the assassin. He then uncovers the assassin's hidden base of operations.|$|E
5|$|For Constantine's {{last years}} as king {{there is only}} the meagre record of the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba. The death of Æthelstan is reported, as are two others. The first of these, in 938, is that of Dubacan, mormaer of Angus or son of the mormaer. Unlike the report of 918, on this {{occasion}} the title mormaer {{is attached to a}} geographical area, but it is unknown whether the Angus of 938 was in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> similar to the later mormaerdom or earldom. The second death, entered with that of Æthelstan, is that of Eochaid mac Ailpín, who may, from his name, have been a kinsman of Constantín.|$|E

5|$|Four {{anatomic}} features must {{be present}} for orotracheal intubation to be straightforward: adequate mouth opening (full {{range of motion}} of the temporomandibular joint), sufficient pharyngeal space (determined by examining {{the back of the}} mouth), sufficient submandibular space (distance between the thyroid cartilage and the chin, the space into which the tongue must be displaced in order for the larygoscopist to view the glottis), and adequate extension of the cervical spine at the atlanto-occipital joint. If any of these variables is in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> compromised, intubation should be expected to be difficult.|$|E
5|$|He {{would carry}} the day after federal {{prosecutors}} appealed for an en banc rehearing by the entire court, reiterating that point for an eight-judge majority and saying that unless Jacobson could demonstrate that a specifically protected right had been violated by the investigation, the conviction should stand. The majority also rejected the entrapment defense, arguing that the postal investigators had merely provided Jacobson with opportunities to purchase child pornography and not sought to affect his predisposition (an important element in entrapment under U.S. law) {{to do so in}} <b>any</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E

GamesRadar listed Final Fantasy Adventure {{as one of the}} titles they want in the 3DS Virtual Console.|$|E

5|$|In October 1918, the regiment's {{part in the}} war now over; they {{returned}} to the Jordan Valley. However many men were now struck down with malaria. In the next few days those who were able returned to Richon-le-Zion, where they established their camp. By November the regiment had eleven officers and 331 other ranks in hospital; twenty-two of those died of the disease. Only two men from the regiment had not been infected in <b>any</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{there were}} {{problems}} {{with all of these}} hypotheses: the regressive hypothesis did not explain why even the smallest of cellular parasites do not resemble viruses in <b>any</b> <b>way.</b> The escape hypothesis did not explain the complex capsids and other structures on virus particles. The virus-first hypothesis contravened the definition of viruses in that they require host cells. Viruses are now recognised as ancient and as having origins that pre-date the divergence of life into the three domains. This discovery has led modern virologists to reconsider and re-evaluate these three classical hypotheses.|$|E
