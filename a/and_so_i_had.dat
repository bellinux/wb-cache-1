500|$|Aaliyah was {{released}} {{five years after}} One in a Million. Aaliyah had not intended for the albums {{to have such a}} gap between them. [...] "I wanted to take a break after One in a Million to just relax, think about how I wanted to approach the next album. Then, when I was ready to start back up, [...] "Romeo" [...] happened, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to take another break and do that film and then do the soundtrack, then promote it. The break turned into a longer break than I anticipated." [...] Connie Johnson of the Los Angeles Times argued that Aaliyah having to focus on her film career may have caused her to not give the album [...] "the attention it merited." [...] Collaborator Timbaland concurred, stating that he was briefly in Australia to work on the album while Aaliyah was filming and did not feel the same production had gone into Aaliyah as One in a Million had. He also said Virgin Records had rushed the album and Aaliyah had specifically requested Missy Elliott and Timbaland work on Aaliyah with her.|$|E
500|$|However, as is {{most often}} the case with film adaptations, {{differences}} do exist between the film and source material. Certain scenes from the book were cut from the film, such as a biology room scene where Bella's class does blood typing. Hardwicke explains, [...] "Well [...] almost 500 pages—you do have to do the sweetened condensed milk version of that.... We already have two scenes in biology: the first time they're in there and then the second time when they connect. For a film, when you condense, you don't want to keep going back to the same setting over and over. So that's not in there." [...] The settings of certain conversations in the book were also changed to make the scenes more [...] "visually dynamic" [...] on-screen, such as Bella's revelation that she knows Edward is a vampire—this happens in a meadow in the film instead of in Edward's car as in the novel. A biology field trip scene is added to the film to condense the moments of Bella's frustration at trying to explain how Edward saved her from being crushed by a van. The villainous vampires are introduced earlier in the film than in the novel. Rosenberg said that [...] "you don't really see James and the other villains until to {{the last quarter of the}} book, which really won't work for a movie. You need that ominous tension right off the bat. We needed to see them and that impending danger from the start. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to create back story for them, what they were up to, to flesh them out a bit as characters." [...] Rosenberg also combined some of the human high school students, with Lauren Mallory and Jessica Stanley in the novel becoming the character of Jessica in the film, and a [...] "compilation of a couple of different human characters" [...] becoming Eric Yorkie. About these variances from the book, Mooradian stated, [...] "I think we did a really judicious job of distilling [...] Our greatest critic, Stephenie Meyer, loves the screenplay, and that tells me that we made all the right choices in terms of what to keep and what to lose. Invariably, you're going to lose bits and pieces that certain members of the audience are going to desperately want to see, but there's just a reality that we're not making 'Twilight: The Book' the movie." ...|$|E
2500|$|Independent studio Media Rights Capital (MRC), {{founded by}} Mordecai Wiczyk and Asif Satchu, {{producer}} of {{films such as}} Babel, purchased the rights to House of Cards with the intention to create a series. While finishing production on his 2008 film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, David Fincher's agent showed him House of Cards, a BBC miniseries starring Ian Richardson. Fincher was interested in producing a potential series with Eric Roth. Fincher {{said that he was}} interested in doing television because of its long-form nature, adding that working in film does not allow for complex characterizations the way that television allows. [...] "I felt {{for the past ten years}} that the best writing that was happening for actors was happening in television. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been looking to do something that was longer form," [...] Fincher stated.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{written it}} whilst we wait their return, and Mrs. Harker has written with the {{typewriter}} all since {{she brought the}} MS to us.|$|R

2500|$|Merkerson {{made her}} {{television}} debut as Reba the Mail Lady on Pee-wee's Playhouse. [...] "It {{was one of}} those wild things where I went to audition. And I thought I was funny and the person I auditioned for didn't, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> blown the job and I guess weeks later they got new casting people," [...] Merkerson said on the NPR program Tell Me More. [...] "I didn't know who Pee-wee Herman was, so if, you know, for fans of the show, if they watch like the first episode that I ever did, I think it was a big party and he just kept making me laugh because I had never seen the character before. And the director was angry and he was like how can we get through this scene? And I said I {{have to look at the}} plate. So the entire [...] he's serving hors d'oeuvres, I'm looking at the plate, and we're still good buddies. He still, to this day, knows how to make me laugh like no one else, Paul Reubens". Merkerson has also appeared on The Cosby Show, among other series.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> my way, and we {{gained the}} room where his infamous traffic had been held. Yet for once he spoke the truth. She was no longer there.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Roberts: [...] "Oh, yes! Mrs. Miller never {{gives you}} {{anything}} but ice-cream; and I {{thought we should}} all need something hot when we got back, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a few--But I forgot all about the supper!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'You {{have been}} so good to me that I wish {{to do the best}} for you; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{arranged}} that you shall occupy the state suite in the right wing.' ...|$|R
6000|$|My mother {{drank the}} water and spoke. [...] "That boy," [...] she said, [...] "takes after his father. He grows more like him every day.... <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> brought him to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have made}} up my mind that <b>I</b> must <b>have</b> money, Pa. <b>I</b> feel that I can't beg it, borrow it, or steal it; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{resolved}} that <b>I</b> must marry it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You know, mother, I accused him--that is, I {{suspected}} him {{of dancing}} with Miss Moseley against {{my right to}} her; now you find {{that it was all}} a mistake, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> better act with dignity, and confess my error." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. A {{man named}} Crawford, {{who was in}} our regiment. He was {{appointed}} an officer {{on the same day}} I was shot; but, as he was appointed after the occurrence they held that his single witnessing was not enough, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to hunt for another." ...|$|E
60|$|My friend {{struggled}} with the case several minutes, turning it over and examining it in his mind, then he said that so {{far as he could}} see the modification was itself a lie, it being a misleading reservation of an explanatory fact, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> told two lies instead of only one.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am your nearest neighbor, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{climbed up}} here to get acquainted. I am Agatha Lord, but {{of course you do}} not know me, because I came from Boston, whereas you came from--from--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-bye, you fellows," [...] he said; [...] "I am {{off with}} the right wing {{according}} to orders; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> come to shake hands, in case we should not meet again, you know," [...] he added significantly.|$|R
6000|$|... "She is. The Skeezers did it <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{declared}} war on them. In revenge for making my wife a Pig I intend to ruin their Magic Island and make the Skeezers the slaves of the Flatheads!" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{did not see}} him any more, but I detest his memory. Of course my resentment did {{not extend}} to the students, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> an unforgettable good time talking to them.

6000|$|... "You gave me {{credit for}} more {{sharpness}} than I possess, Dick.

6000|$|... "I {{forgot all}} about it," [...] he said humbly. [...] "You see, this morning the poundman got Maria's two cows and the baby calf, and--well, it {{happened}} that Maria didn't have any money, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to recover her cows for her. That's where the Transcontinental fiver went--'The Ring of Bells' went into the poundman's pocket." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course he}} is," [...] said Edna, {{speaking}} in a low voice. [...] "We cannot expect such a boy to keep awake, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been on watch. It was easy {{enough for me to}} keep my eyes open." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> valued {{my chair}} ever since, [...] Like {{the shrine of}} a saint, or the throne of a prince; [...] Saint Fanny, my patroness sweet I declare, [...] The queen of my heart and my cane-bottom'd chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! Yes, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have.</b> But {{here is a}} {{proof of}} what I was saying. My poor head, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> quite forgot it. Well, the thing is this: <b>I</b> <b>have</b> just had a letter from John; you can guess the contents." ...|$|R
6000|$|Butter wouldn't {{kill himself}} with the {{life-preserver}} in sight, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> an idea.

6000|$|... 'I don't know, Ada, I {{really had}} not made up my mind.

60|$|Calots are not {{permitted}} {{within the walls of}} the palace proper, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> had to relegate poor Woola to quarters in the stables where the royal thoats are kept.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> again ceased all work, because I {{felt that}} it {{strained}} my head a little, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> resumed the tedious task of waiting with folded hands for better days. But thanks to George Sand and the sunshine, I am very jolly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I do," [...] said Uncle Hatto. [...] "I {{do think}} it foolish {{for young people to}} hold {{themselves}} betrothed before they have got anything to live on, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> told your father. He answered me by saying that you were not betrothed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And wouldn't I be {{very glad}} to? but she wouldn't come among strangers at once; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> got a letter, which she wrote for me, {{to put in}} the post, in case they are glad to see me, and then she will come on.' ...|$|R
60|$|While I {{was still}} {{watching}} their sluggish motions in the sunlight, and noting each strange detail of their form, the curate {{reminded me of}} his presence by pulling violently at my arm.

6000|$|Of {{those that}} were summoned to take me, and to keep me, and to retake me again, there was a moiety, as cousin Nicol Jarvie calls it, that had nae will that I suld be either taen, or keepit fast, or retaen; and of tother moiety, there was as half was feared to stir me; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> only like the fourth part of fifty or sixty men to deal withal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{did some}} {{business}} in diamonds myself when I was a younger man, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> an opportunity of observing their {{fluctuations in the}} market. Now, {{there is one thing}} which invariably depreciates the price of diamonds. That is the rumour of fresh discoveries of mines {{in other parts of the}} world. The instant such a thing gets wind the value of the stones goes down wonderfully. The discovery of diamonds in Central India not long ago had that effect very markedly, and they have never recovered their value since. Do you follow me?" ...|$|E
