5|$|Muirhead-Gould {{gave the}} general <b>alarm,</b> along with orders for ships to take anti-submarine measures, at 22:27; the <b>alarm</b> was {{repeated}} at 22:36 with advice for ships to take precautions against attack, {{as an enemy}} submarine {{might be in the}} harbour. At {{the time of the first}} <b>alarm,</b> Sydney Harbour was closed to external traffic, but Muirhead-Gould ordered ferries and other internal traffic to continue, as he believed that having multiple ships travelling around at speed would help force any submarines to remain submerged.|$|E
5|$|Termites rely on <b>alarm</b> {{communication}} {{to defend a}} colony. <b>Alarm</b> pheromones can be released when the nest has been breached or is being attacked by enemies or potential pathogens. Termites always avoid nestmates infected with Metarhizium anisopliae spores, through vibrational signals released by infected nestmates. Other methods of defence include intense jerking and secretion of fluids from the frontal gland and defecating faeces containing <b>alarm</b> pheromones.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Failure {{location}} in transparent optical networks {{is difficult because}} of corrupted <b>alarms</b> and {{the large amount of}} <b>alarms</b> that a failure can trigger. One problem that network operators often face is how to set the thresholds in monitoring devices. Setting the thresholds low results in false <b>alarms,</b> whereas setting them high presents the risk of missing a significant degradation in network performance because of missing <b>alarms.</b> In this work, we show that for a network with binary <b>alarms</b> (<b>alarms</b> are either present or not), there is an asymmetry between false and missing <b>alarms.</b> We prove that false <b>alarms</b> can be corrected in polynomial time but the correction of missing <b>alarms</b> is NP-hard. Because of this asymmetry between false and missing <b>alarms,</b> false <b>alarms</b> have a lesser effect on the accuracy of the diagnosis results than missing <b>alarms</b> do. Network operators therefore, when allowed, should set the threshold low to favor false <b>alarms...</b>|$|R

5|$|Wildebeest {{can also}} {{listen in on}} the <b>alarm</b> calls of other species, and by doing so can reduce their risk of predation. One study showed, along with other ungulates, wildebeests responded more {{strongly}} to the baboon <b>alarm</b> calls compared to the baboon contest calls, though both types of calls had similar patterns, amplitudes, and durations. The <b>alarm</b> calls were a response of the baboons to lions, and the contest calls were recorded when a dispute between two males occurred.|$|E

40|$|Objective To compare {{rates of}} {{nuisance}} <b>alarms</b> and disconnection between ionization and photoelectric smoke <b>alarms.</b> Design A prospective cohort study. Setting Four Inupiat Eskimo {{villages in the}} NorthwestArctic Borough region of Alaska, 48 km (30 mi) above the Arctic Circle. Subjects Households in 4 communities with similar populations, number of homes, mean income, size of household, and square footage per home. Intervention Two villages had photoelectric <b>alarms</b> installed (58 homes), and 2 other villages had ionization <b>alarms</b> installed (65 homes) in standard locations. Follow-up household surveys were conducted after 6 months to determine rates of false <b>alarms</b> and detector disconnection. All of the households that could be contacted 104 / 123 {{agreed to participate in}} the follow-up surveys. Main outcome measures The proportion of households experiencing false <b>alarms</b> and the proportion of disabled <b>alarms</b> in households in each of the test communities. Results Homes with ionization <b>alarms</b> had more than 8 times the rate of false <b>alarms</b> as those with photoelectric <b>alarms.</b> Eleven of the ionization <b>alarms</b> (19 %) were disconnected compared with 2 of the photoelectric devices (4 %). Conclusions In small rural residences, photoelectric smoke <b>alarms</b> have lower rates of false <b>alarms</b> and disconnection. Photoelectric <b>alarms</b> may be the preferred choice for dwellings with limited living space or frequent false <b>alarms...</b>|$|R

5|$|Many rodent species, {{particularly}} those that are diurnal and social, have {{a wide range of}} <b>alarm</b> calls that are emitted when they perceive threats. There are both direct and indirect benefits of doing this. A potential predator may stop when it knows it has been detected, or an <b>alarm</b> call can allow conspecifics or related individuals to take evasive action. Several species, for example prairie dogs, have complex anti-predator <b>alarm</b> call systems. These species may have different calls for different predators (e.g. aerial predators or ground-based predators) and each call contains information {{about the nature of the}} precise threat. The urgency of the threat is also conveyed by the acoustic properties of the call.|$|E

5|$|Ruffed lemurs are {{cooperative}} breeders, {{with parental}} care being {{shared by all}} community members. For example, mothers will stash their offspring with other mothers or leave them to be guarded by other community members, including non-breeding individuals of both genders. While the mother is away, community members will not only care for and guard them, but also sound <b>alarm</b> calls if danger is detected or if leaving the infant alone. They will also respond to <b>alarm</b> calls by others. These coordinated vigilance displays further involve communal transmission of the <b>alarm</b> call, with nearby community members repeating the <b>alarm</b> call, potentially summoning the mother back to her offspring. Infant transport by {{other members of the}} community has also been recorded. Females have been observed nursing infants of their close relatives, while close kin have adopted rejected infants, acting as foster parents.|$|E
5|$|Ruffed lemurs use <b>alarm</b> {{calls that}} {{differentiate}} between ground and aerial predators. For instance an abrupt roar or huff alerts {{the group to}} an avian predator, and a pulsed squawk or growl-snort communicates {{the existence of a}} mammalian ground predator. When sounding these calls, such as the pulsed squawk, adults direct them at the predator after moving to a safe position. Once the <b>alarm</b> call is sounded by one individual, the resulting chorus can even reach the furthest ranging community members.|$|E

Various species of spiders prefer to prey on meat ants, mainly {{attracted}} by the <b>alarm</b> pheromone the ants release. One spider, in particular, the cursorial spider Habronestes bradleyi, is a specialist predator against these ants and uses their <b>alarm</b> pheromones that are released during territorial disputes to locate them. These <b>alarm</b> signals are created by oscillating the body along the longitudinal axis, which are mostly released when an ant encounters a nest mate.|$|E
