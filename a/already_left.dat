5|$|Following Spies' speech, {{the crowd}} was {{addressed}} by Parsons, the Alabama-born editor of the radical English-language weekly The Alarm. The crowd was so calm that Mayor Carter Harrison Sr., who had stopped by to watch, walked home early. Parsons spoke {{for almost an hour}} before standing down in favor of the last speaker of the evening, the British socialist Samuel Fielden, who delivered a brief ten-minute address. Many of the crowd had <b>already</b> <b>left</b> as the weather was deteriorating.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{this series}} of events is {{extremely}} improbable. Constantius had <b>already</b> <b>left</b> Helena {{by the time he}} left for Britain.

5|$|In the epilogue, {{several of}} the staff share {{thoughts}} about Michael in private interviews. The episode finishes with a scene that takes place the next morning, with the entire staff waiting {{in the conference room}} for Michael to arrive for his farewell party, unaware he has <b>already</b> <b>left,</b> with the exception of Jim and Pam. When DeAngelo deduces Michael is not coming, he begins tearing pieces off Michael's farewell cake (a major subplot point of the episode) and throwing them in the trash, in a bizarre public internal struggle over his dieting. The rest of the staff, particularly Jim and Dwight, watch their new boss's outburst with concern.|$|E
5|$|Swedish {{squadron}} {{consisting of}} seven ships {{of the line}} and three frigates and their assorted support ships under Admiral Gustav Wattrang had been delayed by the easterly winds arrived only after the Russian fleet had <b>already</b> <b>left</b> back for Saint Petersburg. Since they were unable to approach the town due to Russian defenses the Swedish squadron chose to arrange blockade of their own outside of Trångsund to trap the few Russian ships left behind. However, due to the late arrival of the squadron the town had in effect already been lost and its surrender was only matter of time.|$|E

5|$|The cult of Athena Polias (the city's eponymous goddess) {{was central}} to Athenian society, {{reinforcing}} morality and maintaining societal structure. Women {{played a key role}} in the cult; the priestesshood of Athena was a position of great importance, and the priestess could use her influence to support political positions. According to Herodotus, before the Battle of Salamis the priestess of Athena encouraged the evacuation of Athens by telling the Athenians that the snake sacred to Athena (which lived on the Acropolis) had <b>already</b> <b>left.</b>|$|E

Astrid identifies several other potential candidates, including a doctor from Massive Dynamic who had <b>already</b> <b>left.</b> By the time Fringe division reaches his home, they find the man, a shapeshifter, already dead.|$|E
5|$|A centenary {{celebration of}} Brooke rule in Sarawak {{was held in}} 1941. During the celebration, a new {{constitution}} was introduced that would limit {{the power of the}} Rajah and granting the Sarawak people a greater role in the functioning of government. However, this constitution was never fully implemented due to the Japanese occupation. That same year saw the British withdrawing its air and marine forces defending Sarawak to Singapore. With Sarawak now unguarded, the Brooke regime adopted a scorched earth policy where oil installations in Miri were to be destroyed and the Kuching airfield held as long as possible before being destroyed. Nevertheless, a Japanese invasion force led by Kiyotake Kawaguchi landed in Miri on 16 December 1941 and conquered Kuching on 24 December 1941, with British ground forces retreating to Singkawang in neighbouring Dutch Borneo. After ten weeks of fighting there, the Allied forces surrendered on 1 April 1942. Charles Vyner Brooke, the last Rajah of Sarawak, had <b>already</b> <b>left</b> for Sydney, Australia; his officers were captured by the Japanese and interned at the Batu Lintang camp.|$|E

5|$|Alvarado {{arrived at}} Buena Esperanza {{in the middle}} of its abandonment. His sudden {{appearance}} halted the exodus, and many colonists who had <b>already</b> <b>left</b> returned. Cerezeda sent messages from Naco, imploring Alvarado to take over as governor of the province. The town council joined in session and installed Alvarado as justicia mayor (chief judge), and as captain-general of Honduras-Higueras until the Crown appointed someone else, or confirmed him in his post. Alvarado's presence turned Spanish morale around overnight. The factions that had plagued the colonial government dissipated, and the colonists rallied around the new governor. Alvarado, known to the natives by his Nahuatl nickname Tonatiuh, had a fearsome reputation amongst the indigenous population, who had heard of his ruthless exploits elsewhere. Alvarado rapidly re-established firm Spanish control over the area around Buena Esperanza and founded a military encampment in Tencoa. He successfully established profitable gold and silver mines in Higueras.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Rajah Charles Vyner Brooke {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of airstrips in Kuching, Oya, Mukah, Bintulu, and Miri. Construction of the Bintulu airstrip was started in 1934 {{under the direction of}} C.W. Bailey, a Works and Building Inspector for the British Royal Air Force (RAF). All the airstrips were completed except for the Bintulu airstrip, where construction was discontinued in October 1938 due to financial reasons. Japanese forces landed in Miri on 16 December 1941. Sarawak fell into Japanese hands when they conquered Kuching on 24 December 1941. When the Japanese invaded Sarawak, Charles Vyner Brooke <b>already</b> <b>left</b> for Sydney (Australia) before the attack while his officers were captured by the Japanese and interned at the Batu Lintang camp. During the Japanese occupation, the Japanese used the airstrip for military purposes. However, the airstrip was heavily bombed by Allied forces. The British began reconstruction of the airstrip after the war; during the project many unexploded bombs were unearthed.|$|E
5|$|Early in March 1676, a Danish {{fleet of}} 20 ships under Admiral Niels Juel left Copenhagen. On 29 April it landed troops on Gotland, which soon surrendered. The Swedish fleet was ordered out on 4 May, but {{experienced}} adverse winds and was delayed until 19 May. Juel had by then <b>already</b> <b>left</b> Visby, the principal port of Gotland with a garrison force. He headed for Bornholm {{to join with}} a small Danish–Dutch squadron in cruising between Scania and the island of Rügen to prevent any Swedish seaborne reinforcement from reaching Pomerania. On 25–26 May the two fleets met each another {{in the battle of}} Bornholm. Despite the considerable Swedish advantage in ships, men and guns, they were unable to inflict any losses on the allied force, and lost a fireship and two minor vessels. The battle revealed the lack of coherence and organization within the Swedish ranks, which soured relations between Creutz and his officers.|$|E
