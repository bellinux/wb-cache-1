The Governor's Council appointed one of its members to join the committee studying the proposal.

5000|$|Cultural/{{political}}/economic marginalization/hegemony. Cultural imperialism {{occurs when}} political and economical power is {{closely tied to}} a particular language and culture {{so that there is}} a strong incentive for individuals to abandon their language (on behalf of themselves and their children) in favor of another more prestigious one. One example of this is assimilatory education. This frequently happens when indigenous populations, in order to achieve a higher social status, have better chance to get employment, or are forced to it in school, adopt the cultural and linguistic traits of a people who have come to dominate them through colonisation, conquest, or invasion; examples of this kind of endangerment are the Welsh, Scottish Gaelic, and Scots in Great Britain, the Ainu language in Japan, and the Chamorro language in Guam. This is {{the most common cause of}} language endangerment. Ever since Indian government adopted Hindi as the official language of the union government, Hindi has taken over many languages in India. Other forms of cultural imperialism include religion and technology. Religious groups may hold the belief that use of a certain language is immoral or require its followers to speak one language that is the <b>approved</b> <b>language</b> of the religion. Cultural hegemony may often arise not from domination or conquest but simply from increasing contact with a larger and more influential language community through better communications compared with the relative isolation of past centuries.|$|E

40|$|URL] {{and other}} higher {{education}} establishments throughout the world, including South Africa, have become {{concerned about the}} academic literacy levels of the students they enrol. The problem at most South African tertiary education institutions, which {{is in line with}} global trends, is certainly considerable, with almost a third of the students identified as being at risk. A lack of ability in academic discourse is seen as a major cause of students' failure to complete their courses within the given period. In 2006, as part of a nationwide attempt to remedy the academic literacy crisis, Stellenbosch University, along with other academic establishments, officially decided to implement a test of academic literacy in both English and Afrikaans. At Stellenbosch University, the English version of this test is known as TALL (Test of Academic Literacy Levels). It was developed to assess reading and writing abilities in an academic context. The results are used to ‘stream’ students into programmes which assist them in acquiring the various skills deemed necessary for their academic success. Students are sorted according to their TALL results into 'high risk' and 'low to no risk' categories, however, a need has been identified for further screening of the borderline students whose performance in the test falls between these two groups. Administrative and logistical limitations have, thus far, prevented listening skills from being included in the construct of TALL, but there is general consensus that listening is an important skill, particularly at university level. The focus of the research project, reported on in this article, was to design, and put into practice, an academic listening test (ALT) to assist in decision making regarding the placement of first-year students in <b>approved</b> <b>language</b> courses at Stellenbosch University. The qualitative and quantitative results obtained from the various administrations of ALT were analysed to determine {{the reliability and validity of}} the test.

One plank reflected a more isolationist approach, eliminating references to giving weapons to Ukraine in its fight with Russia and rebel forces, after Trump staffers reportedly intervened with delegates. The platform adopted by the platform committee opposes a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While the 2012 Republican platform called for passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the 2016 platform adopted by the convention committee omits mention of the agreement, reflecting the influence of presumptive nominee Donald Trump, who opposes the trade pact.
