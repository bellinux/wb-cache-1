500|$|On September 19, 2010, Mars {{was arrested}} in Las Vegas at the Hard Rock Casino for {{possession}} of cocaine. While talking to a police officer, Mars reportedly declared that {{what he did was}} [...] "foolish" [...] and that [...] "he has never used drugs before." [...] Mars pleaded guilty to felony drug possession and in return was told that the charges would be erased from his criminal record as long as he stayed out of trouble for a year. He paid a $2,000 fine, did 200 hours of community service, and completed a drug counseling course. Nevertheless, in a cover story for GQ magazine in 2013, Mars said [...] "I was young, man! I was in f---ing Vegas...I wasn't thinking", he added: [...] "I was given a number one record and I'm out doing dumb sh--." [...] Mars confessed that he lied to the authorities about having done cocaine before, saying [...] "I don't know where that came from", adding: [...] "I was really intoxicated. I was really drunk. So <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a big blur, and I try every day to forget and keep pushing." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Lucas {{drafted the}} script for The Phantom Menace, he envisioned a [...] "link between Padmé and Princess Leia, the {{daughter}} who follows so closely in her footsteps." [...] According to Natalie Portman, [...] "It definitely did come into play how strong and smart a character Carrie Fisher portrayed, because I think that <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> passed on from parent to child. I think George wrote Amidala as a strong, smart character, but it helped to know that I had this great woman before me who had portrayed her character as a fiery woman." [...] Paul McDonald notes that there are [...] "inevitable comparisons" [...] between the two characters: [...] "both develop soft spots for rogue pilots, and both have a knack for slipping {{into and out of}} stilted British accents." [...] Despite being diplomats, each is also the best marksman of her respective trilogy, rarely missing.|$|E
2500|$|At the May 2013 I/O {{developers}} {{conference in}} San Francisco, Page delivered a keynote address {{and said that}} [...] "We're at maybe 1% of what is possible. Despite the faster change, we're still moving slow relative to the opportunities we have. I think <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> because of the negativity... Every story I read is Google vs someone else. That's boring. We should be focusing on building the things that don't exist" [...] {{and that he was}} [...] "sad the Web isn't advancing as fast as it should be" [...] citing a perceived focus on negativity and zero sum games among some in the technology sector as a cause for that. In response to an audience question, Page noted an issue that Google had been experiencing with Microsoft, whereby the latter made its Outlook program interoperable with Google, but did not allow for backward compatibility—he referred to Microsoft's practice as [...] "milking off." [...] During the question-and-answer section of his keynote, Page expressed interest in Burning Man, which Brin had previously praised—it was a motivating factor for the latter during Schmidt's hiring process, as Brin liked that Schmidt had attended the week-long annual event.|$|E

2500|$|Guadalajara, due to {{the ongoing}} Mexican Drug War, has seen {{escalating}} violence. Some countries, including the United States and Canada, expressed concerns about the safety and security of the region. Scott Backmun of the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) raised concerns about the city's ability to host the games {{in light of the}} drug war. Due to the increased safety issues the USOC had its own security plan for the games. During a meeting of the USOC in March 2011, chief security officer Larry Buendorf gave a report {{to the rest of the}} committee in which he said, [...] "We’re going to prepare for Guadalajara like we would any other Games. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> just preparing your athletes for the individual environments that they’re going into. Everybody is quite aware of the violence that has happened. We’re obviously concerned about it, and at the end of the day, I think we have a good security plan in place to try to protect our athletes". After grenades were thrown near a nightclub entrance in two separate incidents in February 2011, organizers said they were making security a priority and arranged for police and members of the armed forces to patrol in Guadalajara throughout the games.|$|E

"This record, {{you know}} <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> me {{releasing}} whatever I have to and grieving in whatever way, {{and having a}} lot of anger and then trying to sort of move forward, to forgive," [...] Nguyen says.

5000|$|Joseph Bishara {{described}} {{the production of}} the album: [...] "The way we did it was different from the way records get done, not even taking the time to print time-code and lock-up and do stuff we need to get a programmed kick drum in. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> me literally playing kick drum in. Now you’re punching in programming that you’re playing live. It was a very raw and punk rock way to do electronic." ...|$|E
5000|$|There is a {{tendency}} among dwarfs, who in their native mines are often soft-spoken, filial and respectful, to suddenly transform into beer-swilling, brawling, axe-waving clichés when they go abroad. It's noted that <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> (<b>that</b> <b>is</b> to say, all of them except [...] "hi-ho") dwarf drinking songs seem to comprise the single word [...] "gold" [...] repeated in singsong. Some dwarfs attempt to project greater machismo by carrying more and larger axes, and wearing heavier and more elaborate armour than standard. This is known as [...] "clang" [...] (a play on bling).|$|E
5000|$|After {{returning}} to Los Angeles in 1986, Tighe began working again in television and movies. His late 1980s movie appearances were in Matewan, Eight Men Out, K-9, and as club-owner Frank Tilghman in 1989's Road House with Patrick Swayze. During a 2006 interview, Tighe stated, [...] "I've gotten more comments on that movie {{than any other}} film I've ever done." [...] Saying he is amazed by the film's broad audience appeal, he further said, [...] "Working class people like it, (college kids), white people, black people. I think <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> due to the music ... the movie had great music." ...|$|E

50|$|Frampton left Humble Pie {{because that}} group {{fell into a}} loud, hard rock groove that {{overwhelmed}} the technical skills he'd spent years working on as a guitarist; he poured <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> into this highly melodic mid-tempo rock album.|$|R
5000|$|Over {{a hundred}} songs were {{considered}} for the album over a 3-month rehearsal period, all recorded as demos at the Sydney Opera House. Barnes and Prestwich had both stockpiled songs. Walker, who had recently used songs for Moss's Petrolhead, Tex, Don and Charlie's Sad but True, and his own solo debut, felt he had little to offer. [...] "I didn't have much around. So <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> written from a standing start. I assumed the reunion album {{was going to be}} largely written by the other guys and I was quite relaxed about that." ...|$|E

There are some elements that they’ve introduced that will make Abraham’s back story that much more tragic. All three of those characters are going to seem extremely familiar to those who know the comics. They’re almost exact up {{to the point where we}} meet them. Where they go from here, we’ll all learn that together.|$|E
5000|$|In 2002, Reinhart {{embarked}} on a two-year pizza quest trekking through America and Italy {{in search of the}} perfect pie, which he chronicled in his book, American Pie: My Search for the Perfect Pizza. He found that [...] "there's a big difference between good (about 99 percent of pizza out there) and very good (1 percent)" [...] - and <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> due to the crust. Since 2010, he has been the host of pizzaquest.com, where he shares videos, blog entries, and recipes on his never-ending search for the perfect pizza, and also explores pizza {{as a metaphor for the}} universal search for meaning and self-discovery.|$|E

5000|$|When I {{made the}} Bob Dylan movie Masked and Anonymous, I {{wanted to make}} a Bob Dylan movie that was like a Bob Dylan song. One with <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> layers, <b>that</b> had <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> poetry, <b>that</b> had <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> surrealism and was {{ambiguous}} and hard to figure out, like a puzzle.|$|R
5000|$|Many reviews {{categorized}} the band's early releases as post-rock, {{and compared}} {{them to other}} bands of the genre, most notably fellow Texas instrumental group Explosions in the Sky, although the band members largely reject this description, with Donovan Jones saying: “Fuck post-rock, and fuck being called post-rock.” In {{an interview with the}} Dallas Observer, Jeremy Galindo said, [...] "It can be aggravating. I think after this new album comes out, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> gonna stop. Because this next album is definitely gonna be sounding more like the stuff that we do listen to." [...] The band describe their new sound as being darker and heavier, referring to it as [...] "doomgaze", a portmanteau of doom metal and shoegaze.|$|E
5000|$|Three {{years ago}} Jonny started {{vlogging}} {{about his experiences}} of mental health issues on YouTube in order [...] "to reach out to others with mental health difficulties." [...] Thousands of {{people from around the}} world have watched his vlogs and he was awarded the first annual Janey Antoniou award by the mental health charity, Rethink Mental Illness, for his mental health campaigning in 2013. Of the motivation behind his work, Jonny says: [...] "I {{know that a lot of}} people are reluctant to get help, and <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> because of stigma. But the only way we’ll get rid of stigma is if we are more open and talk about mental illness. There is no shame or embarrassment in it. These are human experiences." ...|$|E
5000|$|Adrien Brody {{also spoke}} about reprising {{his role in}} a {{possible}} sequel: [...] "I think <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> determined {{by the success of}} the film. And I don't think that far ahead. The idea of reprising the role and going farther into that character is interesting to me… It would be exciting to watch a character progress or deteriorate. That's exciting for an actor. I thoroughly enjoyed playing Royce. Again, part of the attraction is I'm oddly drawn to material that affects me on an emotional level, and characters that are dealing with things that are challenging that I would question, that I'm not so familiar with. Royce has his emotional arc in this that most of the characters I've played don't come close to possessing. That's an interesting thing to cultivate." ...|$|E

5000|$|Despite {{the success}} of both Liquid Television and Æon Flux, Asher later came in for {{criticism}} from Mike Judge, the creator of Beavis and Butt-head, a successful animated programme initially featured on Liquid Television. Judge was being interviewed by the British magazine loaded in 1997 when the subject turned to the dislike of anything British by the title characters of Beavis and Butt-head. [...] "You know," [...] Judge said, [...] "This just now occurred to me. There was this guy called Japhet Asher who was sort of in charge of Liquid Television. ... He struck me as one of these British people who come over here America and people think they're smart just {{because they have a}} British accent. ... He would say things like, 'A bit of criticism, if I may, Mike.' I wonder if <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> just down to him." ...|$|E
5000|$|He {{frequently}} {{speaks of}} developing and being drawn to dualism in his characters. [...] "If I'm offered {{the role of}} the hero, I immediately look for the antihero within!... I see everything in terms of an outer skin and an inner skin." [...] He creates [...] "character diaries" [...] with entire biographies for the characters he plays. [...] "It was important to me to put in a background for my character that would be useful for the whole journey. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> secret and no one gets to read that. It's what is useful to me. If you are playing something long-running and a role that has a future the initial series, it's almost like you have to plant a garden which you will need to come back to at some point. If you don't put in early, it can jar with you." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{wanted to}} do the whole {{spectrum}} of folk music from one guy singing and playing guitar or fiddle to a full band with electric guitar," [...] O'Brien said. And that's how the pair (of albums) came out, like folk music bookends. Fiddler's Green tends toward the intimate and traditional, while Cornbread Nation is a bit funkier and tempo-driven. On both, however, old-time tunes sit comfortably next to originals and a few classic country songs by the likes of Jimmie Rodgers and Harlan Howard. I could have taken all traditional songs, but I love stuff like [...] "California Blues" [...] and [...] "Busted," [...] which are like folk songs to me, and they fit with the others, and it shows that what is called country music is just another footstep down the same path. Rock and roll, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the same too.|$|E

500|$|In late 2010, The White Stripes reissued {{their first}} three albums on Third Man Records on a 180-gram vinyl along with 500 limited edition, [...] "split-colored" [...] records to {{accompany}} it. Jack hinted at a possible White Stripes reunion in a 2010 interview with Vanity Fair. He said, [...] "We thought we'd do <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> things <b>that</b> we'd never done: a full tour of Canada, a documentary, coffee-table book, live album, a boxed set...Now <b>that</b> we've gotten <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> out <b>of</b> our system, Meg and I {{can get back}} in the studio and start fresh." ...|$|R
