25|$|It is {{believed}} that such government-sponsored Internet commentators have now become widespread and their numbers {{could be in the}} tens of thousands; Bandurski suggests the number may be up to 280,000 while The Guardian puts the estimate as 300,000. According to The Guardian, the growth in popularity of such <b>astroturfing</b> owes to the ease with which web 2.0 technologies such as Twitter, Wikipedia and YouTube can be employed to sway public opinion. The BBC reports that special centres have been set up to train China's 'army of internet spin doctors'. Data analysis of social media activity and leaked government emails by a team led by Gary King at Harvard's Institute for Quantitative Science showed that the Chinese government generates over 440 million posts every year through such accounts.|$|E
500|$|Yelp has a {{proprietary}} algorithm {{that attempts to}} evaluate whether a review is authentic and filters out reviews that it believes are not based on a patron's actual personal experiences, {{as required by the}} site's Terms of Use. The review filter was first developed two weeks after the site was founded and the company saw their [...] "first obviously fake reviews." [...] Filtered reviews are moved into a special area and not counted towards the businesses' star-rating. The filter sometimes filters legitimate reviews, leading to complaints from business owners. New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman said Yelp has [...] "the most aggressive" [...] <b>astroturfing</b> filter out of the crowd-sourced websites it looked into. Yelp has also been criticized for not disclosing how the filter works, which it says would reveal information on how to outsmart it.|$|E

(TMA) of Dalton, Georgia, acquired the <b>AstroTurf</b> brand and other assets. TMA began marketing the <b>AstroTurf</b> brand under the company <b>AstroTurf,</b> LLC. In 2006, General Sports Venue (GSV) became TMA's marketing partner for the <b>AstroTurf</b> brand for the American market. <b>AstroTurf,</b> LLC handled {{the marketing of}} <b>AstroTurf</b> {{in the rest of}} the world.|$|R

500|$|Yelp also conducts [...] "sting operations" [...] {{to uncover}} {{businesses}} writing their own reviews. In October 2012, Yelp placed a 90-day [...] "consumer alert" [...] on 150 business listings {{believed to have}} paid for reviews. The alert read [...] "We caught someone red-handed trying to buy reviews for this business". In June 2013, Yelp {{filed a lawsuit against}} BuyYelpReview/AdBlaze for allegedly writing fake reviews for pay. In 2013 Yelp sued a lawyer it alleged was {{part of a group of}} law firms that exchanged Yelp reviews, saying that many of the firm's reviews originated from their own office. The lawyer said Yelp was trying to get revenge for his own legal disputes and activism against Yelp. An effort to win dismissal of the case was denied in December 2014. In September 2013, Yelp cooperated with Operation Clean Turf, a sting operation by the New York Attorney General that uncovered 19 <b>astroturfing</b> operations. In April 2017, a Norfolk, Massachusetts [...] jury awarded a jewelry store over $34,000 after it determined that its competitor's employee had filed a false negative Yelp review that knowingly caused emotional distress.|$|E
500|$|Academic Bob Batchelor, {{writing in}} Cult Pop Culture, {{states that the}} {{internet}} has democratized cult culture and destroyed the line between cult and mainstream. [...] Fans {{of even the most}} obscure films can communicate online with each other in vibrant communities. [...] Although known for their big-budget blockbusters, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas have criticized the current Hollywood system of gambling everything on the opening weekend of these productions. [...] Geoffrey Macnab of The Independent instead suggests that Hollywood look to capitalize on cult films, which have exploded in popularity on the internet. [...] The rise of social media has been a boon to cult films. [...] Sites such as Twitter have displaced traditional venues for fandom and courted controversy from cultural critics who are unamused by campy cult films. [...] After a clip from one of his films went viral, director-producer Roger Corman made a distribution deal with YouTube. Found footage which had originally been distributed as cult VHS collections eventually went viral on YouTube, which opened them to new generations of fans. [...] Films such as Birdemic (2008) and The Room (2003) gained quick, massive popularity, as prominent members of social networking sites discussed them. [...] Their rise as [...] "instant cult classics" [...] bypasses the years of obscurity that most cult films labor under. [...] In response, critics have described the use of viral marketing as <b>astroturfing</b> and an attempt to manufacture cult films.|$|E

2500|$|Gerhards and Schäfer {{say they}} have found [...] "only minimal {{evidence}} to support the idea that the internet is a better communication space as compared to print media". [...] "In both media, communication is dominated by (bio- and natural) scientific actors; popular inclusion does not occur". [...] The scholars argue that the search algorithms select the sources of information based on the popularity of their links. [...] "Their gatekeeping, in contrast to the old mass media, relies mainly on technical characteristics of websites". [...] For Gerhards and Schäfer the Internet is not an alternative public sphere because less prominent voices end up being silenced by the search engines' algorithms. [...] "Search engines might actually silence societal debate by giving more space to established actors and institutions". Another tactic that supports this view is <b>astroturfing.</b> The Guardian columnist George Manbiot said that <b>Astroturfing</b> software, [...] "has the potential to destroy the internet as a forum for constructive debate. It jeopardizes the notion of online democracy".|$|E

In October 2004, MetaFilter members uncovered the identities of the writers of the hoax Website Nick Nolte's Diary. An <b>astroturfing</b> campaign by Holden Karnofsky, the co-founder of the online charity GiveWell, was detected in January 2008 through a sockpuppet posting to Ask MetaFilter, leading to Karnofsky's resignation.

2500|$|Much of the {{coverage}} of the debate has involved how the different sides are competing to express their views, rather than the specific reform proposals. The health care reform debate in the United States has been influenced by the Tea Party protest phenomenon, with reporters and politicians spending time reacting to it. Supporters of a greater government role in healthcare, such as former insurance PR executive Wendell Potter of the Center for Media and Democracy- whose funding comes from groups such as the Tides Foundation- argue that the hyperbole generated by this phenomenon is a form of corporate <b>astroturfing,</b> which he says that he used to write for CIGNA. Opponents of more government involvement, such as Phil Kerpen of Americans for Prosperity- whose funding comes mainly from the Koch Industries corporation- counter-argue that those corporations oppose a public-plan, but some try to push for government actions that will unfairly benefit them, such as forcing private companies to buy health insurance for their employees. Journalist Ben Smith has referred to mid-2009 as [...] "The Summer of Astroturf" [...] given the organizing and co-ordinating efforts made by various groups on both pro- and anti-reform sides.|$|E

However, InternetNews and Linux Weekly News noted that CAGW has received funding from Microsoft, and that in 2001 CAGW was caught running an <b>astroturfing</b> campaign on behalf of Microsoft when two letters they submitted supporting Microsoft in Microsoft's anti-trust case were found to have the signatures of deceased persons (Linux Weekly News). James Prendergast, executive director of a coalition named [...] "Americans for Technology Leadership" [...] (ATL), also criticized the state's decision in a Fox News article.
