500|$|John Tobias {{said that}} his inspirations for the game's story and {{characters}} came from the Chinese mythology {{and some of the}} stories and rumored events about the Shaolin monks. Regarding the film Big Trouble in Little China, Tobias wrote that although this movie [...] "kind of Americanized my obsession for supernatural kung fu films from China, it was not my biggest influence. My biggest influences came from Tsui Hark films -- Zu Warriors & The Swordsman. We had to get them from bootleggers in Chicago's Chinatown." [...] Tobias' writing and artistic input on the series ended in 1997. Fifteen years later, he said: [...] "I knew exactly what I was going to do with a future story. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>I</b> [...] a sort of sequel to the first MK film and an advancement to the game's mythological roots. The goal was to not runaway from what came before with a retelling, but to move the themes forward. I did it for fun as an exercise in screenwriting, but it felt good to get that out of my system." ...|$|E
2500|$|The SL game system, {{for all its}} acclaim...was {{based on}} a flawed foundation. [...] The {{subsequent}} gamettes, in building on that start, only complicated matters by attempting to patch that foundation rather than replace it altogether....here's how I rationalize it. [...] <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> ...<b>I</b> was so enamored by (video cassette recorders) that I just had to have one. [...] Two years later they were selling models for half the price with twice the features which mine had. [...] Sometimes I regret buying that VCR so soon, but then I recall all the fun I had with it when it was new and eventually concluded that my money was well spent after all.|$|E
2500|$|Gray {{revealed}} {{the most memorable}} thing anyone has said about her work {{in an interview at}} The Eternal Night, a book review site in Britain. Says Gray, [...] "Well, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>I</b> submitted a story to an editor who wrote back and said it was the sickest thing she ever read, but then she said it was [...] "sick in the best sense of the word". I may be warped, but knowing that the editor had seen a lot of bizarre stuff in her career, I took her comment as a huge compliment, especially since the story was as psychological as it was gritty-physical. I went on to sell it elsewhere (twice!), and it received a Stoker recommendation, so I guess others thought it [...] "sick" [...] as well." ...|$|E

Many complain of my reserve to this day, but then some girls expect too much from a man. We all have our shortcomings. Even then, however, I was not so shy as she.

It was a typical nest-making day, the sun pouring his bright rays through delicate green leaves and a glory of white apple blossoms, the air filled with warmth and fragrance, birds and bees busy everywhere. Orioles seem always happy; to-day they quite overflowed {{in the midst of}} all the brightness, though materials were scarce and they must needs be diligent.|$|E

60|$|From St. Paul's we {{went down}} Cheapside, and, turning into King Street, visited Guildhall, which we found in process of {{decoration}} for a public ball, to take place next week. It looked rather gewgawish thus gorgeous, being hung with flags of all nations, and adorned with military trophies; and the scene was repeated by a range of looking-glasses {{at one end of}} the room. The execrably painted windows really shocked us by their vulgar glare, after those of the Temple Hall and Church; yet, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>I</b> might very likely have thought them beautiful.

We were coming up from Florida. It was a collision on a high trestle. The train crumpled up, and some of the cars fell over sideways and fell off, ninety feet into the bottom of a dry creek.
