5|$|Fantastic Light {{began his}} three-year-old season {{with his first}} Group race win in the Sandown Classic Trial. Ridden by Daryll Holland, he took the lead a furlong out and was eased in the closing stages to win by a short head. Speculation that he might develop into a Derby {{contender}} ended in his next race, when he was stepped up to one and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>miles</b> {{for the first time}} and finished fourth of the five runners in the Lingfield Derby Trial.|$|E
5|$|As {{a four-year-old}} in 1882, Tristan showed much {{improved}} form and {{established himself as}} one of the leading racehorses in Europe by winning ten times in fourteen starts. He began the year by winning a Queen's Plate at Newmarket in April and followed up by winning His Majesty's Plate at Chester in May. At Epsom Downs Racecourse he ran twice at the Derby meeting. In the Epsom Stakes, a handicap race over one and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>miles,</b> Tristan carried top weight of 124 pounds and won by a length and a half from Retreat He then added the Epsom Gold Cup, the race which was the forerunner of the Coronation Cup, in which he successfully conceded twenty-seven pounds to a filly named Isabel.|$|E
5|$|Falker Island is a {{crescent-shaped}} island located {{three and}} <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>miles</b> offshore of Guilford, Connecticut. The island has had several owners including Andrew Leete in the 1600s. In 1715, Caleb and Ebenezer Stone purchased the island, which {{remained in the}} Stone family until 1801. In 1800, Noah Stone sold it to a distant relative, Medad Stone, for $158.34. On May 12, 1801, Medad Stone sold the island to the government for $325. Joel Henderson, a historian, notes that Medad Stone and the government were likely openly communicating about the island. The United States Congress had appropriated $6000 in March 1801 for the lighthouse, prior to the government's acquisition of the property.|$|E

5|$|On {{their way}} home to Devonshire, Elinor and Marianne stop for {{the night at the}} country estate of the Palmers, who live five and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>miles</b> away from Willoughby's estate. Marianne cannot resist going to see the estate; she becomes gravely ill {{trekking}} up a hill in a torrential rain. Colonel Brandon finds her in the rain and brings her home. Elinor stays at her side until she recovers, and the sisters return home. Colonel Brandon and Marianne begin spending time together, as Marianne has a new appreciation for him. She admits to Elinor that even if Willoughby had chosen her, she was no longer convinced that love would have been enough to make him happy.|$|E
5|$|This {{disparity}} between the sizes of the megaliths is unparalleled among the other surviving stone circles in the Dorset area, {{and may have been}} a deliberate choice by the circle's builders, perhaps reflecting sexual symbolism. There are a number of similar circles in south-western Scotland, for example the Loupin' Stones, Ninestane Rigg, and Burgh Hill, all of which share the architectural feature of having two taller stones on their perimeters. Potentially supporting this link between Dorset and south-western Scotland {{is the fact that the}} Grey Mare and her Colts—a chambered long barrow located two and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>miles</b> south-west of the Nine Stones—displays architectural similarities with the Clyde-Solway tradition of chambered long barrows.|$|E

25|$|The Moffat Railway {{was opened}} from Beattock on 2 April 1883. It {{was just over}} one and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>miles</b> (2km) long. It was worked by the Caledonian and absorbed on 11 November 1889. The Caledonian Railway sought to develop both Moffat and Peebles as {{watering}} places, and ran The Tinto Express from both places, combining at Symington, to Edinburgh and Glasgow for several years.|$|E

25|$|One mile to {{the south}} along the River Derwent at Scoreby lies {{the site of a}} 1st to 4th century Roman {{settlement}} known as Derventio. The town runs for two and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>miles</b> east/west alongside a Roman road. Occupying both east and west banks of the river, the town was connected by the construction of a bridge which carried the road. There is no archaeological evidence for a Roman bridge construction at or near the present site of Stamford Bridge.|$|E

25|$|There are sizable pygmy forest {{areas on}} the west facing slopes and more level inner {{plateaus}} of Mount Hood. Here the predominant species are Sargent cypress, various Arctostaphylos species and coyote brush. The Sargent cypress were formerly misidentified as Mendocino cypress (Cupressus pygmaea), which would be far out of their native range here. The height of the pygmy forest is ten to fifteen feet (3 – 5 m) and these patches of relatively dense thickets extend for about a half to one and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>miles</b> (one to two kilometers) in patch size.|$|E
25|$|John Alexander Simpson {{is known}} for inventions such as the gas flow α-particle {{proportional}} counter for measuring plutonium yields {{in the presence of}} high intensity fission products, and a neutron monitor. His obituary in The Guardian noted {{that he was one of}} the most prolific inventors of scientific instruments for space exploration. In 1958 his first created instrument was launched into space, and the last two were launched in 1999.
