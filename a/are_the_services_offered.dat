40|$|This is {{the first}} {{monograph}} in the PREP reading series which focus on reading difficulties and the cooperative efforts of various professionals {{to deal with the}} problems encountered. Each of the four of the series directs its message to a specific person on a school staff; each focuses on a different aspect of treating reading difficulty and explains {{what can be done to}} make that treatment more effective. The target of this monograph is the school principal. It discusses environmental causes of reading problems, describes some successful school reading programs, and offers recommendations and guidelines to the principal for implementing similar programs in his own school. The kit also includes a bibliography of the references cited.

40|$|The {{research}} networking {{community has}} embraced novel network architectures to provide e-Science applications with dedicated connections instead of shared links. IP and optical services converge in these new infrastructures to form hybrid networks. Lightpaths <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>services</b> <b>offered</b> to {{clients in the}} optical portion of the network. They are chosen because they guarantee the appropriate QoS in terms of bandwidth and latency. NDL - the Network Description Language - is a data model offering users and providers of lightpaths with a common ontology to describe topology information of hybrid optical networks. The strength of NDL is that it supports {{a wide range of}} applications, including pathfinding, visualisation and asset management, via the definition of a common data model to exchange network descriptions. Since NDL is based on the Semantic Web techniques, it is straightforward to relate NDL with application-specific ontologies. In this paper we present the current status of the NDL schemas and its use in several applications...|$|E

30|$|The “Service” in SaaS is “the {{function}} of software”. That <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>offers</b> not <b>the</b> software itself but a {{function in the}} network. On the contrary, <b>the</b> term ‘SOA (<b>Service</b> Oriented Architecture)’ is a software architecture design {{on the construction of}} a grand scale computer system and <b>the</b> <b>service</b> in SOA means “the software parts for realizing service due to business model cases”. That is, it is a business component in the client-server model computers. Many developments in the field of computer architectures become to provide a great benefit in the computing forms and the data transmission speed in the Internet becomes faster for the last decade. Moreover, both virtualization and tools for the use of big data are realized in our daily life. All the advances in the environment has made it easier to serve and manage their own “Service infrastructure”. Therefore, because SaaS is related to PaaS and IaaS, we can summarize the cloud computing as a large category.|$|R
