5|$|An {{important}} aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of games, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with stage magic. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained {{over a number of}} consecutive days.|$|E
5|$|Cultural {{depictions of}} dinosaurs have been {{numerous}} since the word dinosaur was coined in 1842.

5|$|As in an oratorio, {{the written}} text in a choral symphony {{can be as}} {{important}} as the music, and the chorus and soloists can participate equally with the instruments in the exposition and development of musical ideas. The text can also help determine whether the composer follows symphonic form strictly, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of Rachmaninoff, Britten and Shostakovich, or whether they expand symphonic form, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of Berlioz, Mahler and Havergal Brian. Sometimes the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures, as with Szymanowski, Schnittke and, again, Havergal Brian. The composer can also choose to treat the text fluidly, in a manner more like music than narrative. Such was the case with Vaughan Williams, Mahler and Philip Glass.|$|E
