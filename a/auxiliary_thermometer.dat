50|$|It {{consists}} of a conventional bulb connected to a capillary in which a constriction is placed so that upon reversal the mercury column breaks off in a reproducible manner. The mercury runs down into a smaller bulb {{at the other end}} of the capillary, which is graduated to read temperature. A 360° turn in a locally widened portion of the capillary serves as a trap to prevent further addition of mercury if the thermometer is warmed and the mercury expands past the break-off point. The remote-reading potentialities of reversing thermometers make them particularly suitable for use in measuring subsea temperature as a function of pressure. In this application, both protected thermometers and unprotected thermometers are used, each of which is provided with an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>thermometer.</b> They are generally used in pairs in Nansen bottles. They are usually read to 0.01°C, and after the proper corrections have been applied, their readings are considered reliable to 0.02°C.|$|E
40|$|The authors present {{simulation}} {{results of a}} portable system designed for measuring thermal parameters of materials, mainly widespread thermal insulation materials. The proposition is to use an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>thermometer</b> and a trained artificial neural network to determine parameters of thermal insulation materials. The network is trained on data extracted from {{a model of a}} nonstationary heat flow process in the sample of material with a hot probe and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>thermometer,</b> based on a two-dimensional heat-conduction model and including heat capacity of the probe handle. To solve the system of partial differential equations describing the model, the finite element method (FEM) was applied. The artificial neural network (ANN) is used to estimate coefficients of the inverse heat conduction problem for solid. The network determines values of the effective thermal conductivity and effective thermal diffusivity on the basis of temperature responses of the hot probe and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>thermometer.</b> Several configurations were evaluated during selection of optimal ANN architecture. The influence of measuring errors on identified values of the thermal parameters was also analyzed using the Monte Carlo technique. All calculations like FEM, training and testing processes as well as the error sensitivity analysis were conducted in the Matlab environment. The proposed method of parameters testing is suitable for temporary measurements in a building site or factory...|$|E
40|$|Thermometers such as Silica, Na/K, Na/K/Ca, Na/K/Ca/Mg or delta 18 O (H 2 O-SO 4), {{based on}} {{empirical}} or semi-empirical laws derived from chemical equilibrium reactions between water and minerals {{in the deep}} reservoirs, are commonly used in geothermal exploration in order to estimate the reservoir temperatures. Unfortunately, these estimations are not always concordant because of processes which can perturb the chemical composition of the fluids during their ascent {{up to the surface}} (water mixing, fluid cooling, etc.). Given these discordances, <b>auxiliary</b> <b>thermometers</b> such as Na/Li, based on statistical relationships, were also developed. As Li is rather lowly reactive, the use of this thermometer can give more reliable temperature estimations. Presently, three different Na/Li relationships ([1], [2]) are mainly available according to the fluid salinity and the geological environment (volcanic/granitic and sedimentary rocks). This study carried out in the framework of the European HITI project (HIgh Temperature Instruments for supercritical geothermal reservoir characterization and exploitation) with the collaboration of ISOR Iceland Geosurvey proposes two new Na/Li thermometric relationships. The first concerns the fluids derived from high-temperature seawater-basalt interaction processes existing in the oceanic ridges and rises {{as well as in the}} emerged rifts such as those of Iceland (Reykjanes, Svartsengi and Seltjarnarnes geothermal fields) and Djibouti (Asal-Ghoubbet and Obock geothermal areas). It can be expressed as follows: Log (Na/Li in mol/l) = 920 /(T°K) + 1. 105 (r 2 = 0. 994). The second relationship, developed using dilute fluids collected only from Icelandic geothermal wells in the 100 - 325 °C range and surprisingly close to that determined by Fouillac and Michard (1981) for volcanic saline fluids at temperatures higher than 200 °C, is: Log (Na/Li in mol/l) = 1786 /(T°K) - 0. 936 (r 2 = 0. 976). The uncertainty on temperature estimation is ± 25 °C for both relationships. These results confirm that the Na/Li ratios not only depend on temperature but also on other parameters. The nature of the reservoir rocks and fluid seems to be the most influent one. Some case studies in the literature and thermodynamic considerations suggest that the Na/Li ratios could be controlled by chemical equilibrium reactions involving different mineral assemblages where illite and micas would be, however, always presen...|$|R
