We Used CCD camera obtain the airbag image, through the image processing method ofsmooth filtering andgray-scale transformationto complete pre-processing, finally applied Canny edge detection operator to extract the boundary of the airbag contour features,and then took the template matching methodto detect assemble error of the airbag image whether meet the requirement. The results show that the detection method have a higher precision, and the time is very short, it can improve the sampled positioningerror detection for the all checks image recognition detection, suitable for application in real-time online detection of <b>airbag</b> <b>assembly</b> line...|$|E
40|$|Airbags {{are subject}} to strict quality control {{in order to ensure}} {{passengers}} safety. The quality of fabric and sewing thread influence the final product and therefore, sewing defects must be early and accurately detected, in order to remove the item from production. <b>Airbag</b> seams <b>assembly</b> can take various forms, using linear and circle primitives, with threads of different colors and length densities, creating lockstitch or double threads chainstitch. The paper presents a framework for the automatic detection of defects occurring during the airbag sewing stage. Types of defects as skipped stitch, missed stitch or superimposed seam for lockstitch and two threads chainstitch are detected and marked. Using image processing methods, the proposed framework follows the seams path and determines if a color pattern of the considered stitches is valid...|$|R
40|$|Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) are {{miniaturized}} {{devices that}} can sense the environment, process and analyze information, and respond {{with a variety}} of mechanical and electrical actuators. Although a few very successful applications have been demonstrated, these have been in very large markets such as accelerometers for the deployment of <b>airbags</b> and <b>assemblies</b> of micro-lenses for televisions and light projectors. Many more applications are needed to fulfill the expectations of futurists and MEMS promoters. Future applications in traditional industrial and consumer products will evolve as MEMS demonstrate that they can reduce cost and improve performance when compared to discrete traditional components. A new kind of system engineer will integrate the various sensing, computing and actuating elements into single chips by re-using existing designs for components. The designs will be available in a catalog of intellectual property available for license. Because of the standard designs, the chips will be produced cost-effectively by commercial foundries in smaller quantities than is possible today. This article describes the MEMS Applications Engineer position and the body of knowledge required for the position. It also describes the tools needed to design the MEMS of the future...|$|R
40|$|Airborne Systems North America (formally Irvin Aerospace Inc) has {{developed}} an Airbag Landing System for the Orion Crew Module of the Crew Exploration Vehicle. This work is {{in support of the}} NASA Langley Research Center Landing System Advanced Development Project. Orion is part of the Constellation Program to send human explorers back to the moon, and then onwards to Mars and other destinations in the Solar System. A component of the Vision for Space Exploration, Orion is being developed to also enable access to space following the retirement of the Space Shuttle in the next decade. This paper documents the development of a conceptual design, fabrication of prototype assemblies, component level testing and two generations of airbag landing system testing. The airbag system has been designed and analyzed using the transient dynamic finite element code LS-DYNA(RegisteredTradeMark). The landing system consists of six <b>airbag</b> assemblies; each <b>assembly</b> comprising a primary impact venting airbag and a non-venting anti-bottoming airbag. The anti-bottoming airbag provides ground clearance following the initial impact attenuation sequence. Incorporated into each primary impact airbag is an active vent that allows the entrapped gas to exit the control volume. The size of the vent is tailored to control the flow-rate of the exiting gas. An internal shaping structure is utilized to control the shape of the primary or main airbags prior to ground impact; this significantly improves stroke efficiency and performance...|$|R
40|$|An airbag {{system for}} {{elevating}} the fuselage of an aircraft off a landing surface a sufficient degree {{to allow for}} emergency egress of passengers and crew through ventral emergency exit doors. An <b>airbag</b> <b>assembly</b> {{made up of a}} plurality of independent airbags is disposed within the aircraft. When activated, the airbag system deploys the airbags external of the aircraft that elevate the fuselage of the aircraft a sufficient degree to allow for utilizing the ventral emergency exit doors on the fuselage to enable evacuating the passengers and crew. An activation mechanism is connected to the inflation. devices associated with each of the airbags. The activation mechanism generates an electrical signal which activates the inflation devices, which in turn fill the airbags with a compressed fluid, thus expanding the airbags and lifting the fuselage. A crew member initiates the activation of the airbag system through one or more switches...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this research project is to develop efficient and optimal fabric part handling technologies for automated processes. We will focus on mechatronic design concepts for intelligent handling of arbitrarily shaped fabric parts, while automatically accounting for variation in material properties. Handling maneuvers such as pick and place will be the primary focus, with design variables being location and number of gripper points, and fabric material properties. The proof-of-concept machines being developed and built will be model based, i. e., they will incorporate computer simulation models of fabric drape and manipulation. Our previous NTC research project involved handling situations where the fabric was allowed to drape or bend in only one direction, essentially strips of fabric. The proposed work will incorporate true three dimensional handling, where compound curvature and torsion will be permitted. Controls that stabilize the fabric motion and allow accurate handling with minimum wrinkling have been developed and will be extended to the three dimensional case. Potential applications for this technology are 3 D automated <b>airbag</b> <b>assembly,</b> automated apparel manufacturing, and automated assembly of automotive interior systems such as: seats, carpets, and headliners. We will work wit...|$|E
