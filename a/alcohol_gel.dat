Objectives: To explore cognitive and psychological functioning in users who intentionally ingest <b>alcohol</b> <b>gel</b> compared with ethyl-alcohol only misusers and controls. Methods: Male, Central and Eastern European alcohol only misusers, (n= 14; mean age 39 years), <b>alcohol</b> <b>gel</b> users (n= 14; mean age 43 years) and controls (n= 12; mean age 31 years) were recruited from a London Homeless Service during 2013 / 14. Alcohol misusers, <b>alcohol</b> <b>gel</b> users and controls were compared on the Forwards and Backwards Digit Span Test; Block Design test; Retrospective and Prospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ) and the Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS). Results: <b>Alcohol</b> <b>gel</b> users performed significantly worse on the Block Design task (p< 0. 01) and PRMQ (p< 0. 01) relative to both alcohol only and control groups, and significantly worse on the digit span relative to controls (p= 0. 01).

The fingertips of 6 volunteers were contaminated with approximately 10 (6) of microbial cells, and then were washed with: plain liquid soap, <b>alcohol</b> <b>gel,</b> 70 % ethyl alcohol (by weight), 10 % povidone-iodine liquid soap (PVP-I), and 4 % chlorhexidine gluconate detergent. The experiments were performed using a Latin square statistical design, with six 6 x 5 randomized blocks, and the results were estimated by ANOVA. The products reduced from 93. 83 % (plain liquid soap) to 100 % (PVP-I) of the microbial population applied to the hands. In 4 of 6 test microorganisms analyzed, 10 % PVP-I, <b>alcohol</b> <b>gel,</b> 70 % ethyl alcohol, and 4 % chlorhexidine had significantly higher removal rates than plain liquid soap (P < 0. 05). The results confirm the effectiveness of <b>alcohol</b> <b>gel</b> for hand hygiene and suggest that 10 % PVP-I, <b>alcohol</b> <b>gel,</b> 70 % ethyl alcohol, and 4 % chlorhexidine may be more effective than plain liquid soap for removing A. baumannii, E. coli, E. faecalis, and C. albicans strains from heavily contaminated hands...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare methods for {{assessing}} compliance with hand hygiene in an intensive care unit (ICU), a step-down unit (SDU), and a hematology–oncology unit. Methods: Over a 20 -week period, we compared hand hygiene compliance measurements by three different methods: direct observation, electronic handwash counter for <b>alcohol</b> <b>gel,</b> and measuring the volume of product used (<b>alcohol</b> <b>gel)</b> in an ICU, an SDU, and a hematology–oncology unit of a tertiary care, private hospital. Results: By direct observation we evaluated 1078 opportunities in the ICU, 1075 in the SDU, and 517 in the hematology–oncology unit, with compliance rates of 70. 7 %, 75. 4 %, and 73. 3 %, respectively. A total of 342   299, 235   914, and 248   698 hand hygiene episodes were recorded by the electronic devices in the ICU, SDU, and hematology–oncology unit, respectively. There were also 127. 2  ml, 85. 3  ml, and 67. 6  ml of <b>alcohol</b> <b>gel</b> used per patient-day in these units. We could find no correlation between the three methods. Conclusions: Hand hygiene compliance was reasonably high in these units, as measured by direct observation. However, a lack of correlation with results obtained by other methodologies brings into question the validity of direct observation results, and suggests that periodic audits using other methods may be needed...|$|E
40|$|Background: Adhesions follow {{abdominal}} surgery with an incidence {{as high as}} 95 %, resulting in invalidating complications such as bowel obstruction, female infertility, and chronic pain. Searches have been performed for a safe and effective adhesion barrier; however, such barriers have impaired anastomotic site healing. The primary {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of a new adhesion barrier, polyvinyl <b>alcohol</b> <b>gel,</b> on healing of colonic anastomoses using a rat model. Methods: Thirty-two Wistar rats were divided in two groups. In all animals, an anastomosis was constructed in the ascending colon. The first group received no adhesion barrier, whereas in the second group, 2 mL of polyvinyl <b>alcohol</b> <b>gel</b> (A-Part Gel®; Aesculap AG, Tuttlingen, Germany) was applied circularly around the anastomosis. All animals were sacrificed on the seventh post-operative day, and the abdomen was inspected for signs of anastomotic leakage. The anastomotic bursting pressure, the adhesions around the anastomosis, and the collagen content of the excised anastomosis were measured. Results: No significant differences were observed between the two groups in the incidence of anastomotic leakage, the anastomotic bursting pressure (p= 0. 08), or the collagen concentration (p= 0. 91). No significant reduction in amount of adhesions was observed in the rats receiving polyvinyl <b>alcohol</b> <b>gel.</b> Conclusions: This experimental study showed no significant differences in anastomotic leakage, anastomotic bursting pressure, or collagen content of the anastomosis when using the adhesion barrier polyvinyl alcohol around colonic anastomoses.

In the presence of probe-sample adhesive interactions, which are common especially during retraction of the rigid tip from soft materials, the Hertzian models are no longer adequate. A number of theories (e. g., Johnson–Kendall–Roberts and Derjaguin–Muller– Toporov), covering {{the full range of}} sample compliance relative to adhesive force and tip radius, are available for analysis of such data.

An automated approach to the processing of AFM indentation data, namely, the extraction of Young’s modulus, is essential to realizing the high-throughput potential of the instrument as an elasticity probe for typical soft materials that exhibit inhomogeneity at microscopic scales. This paper focuses on Hertzian analysis techniques, which are applicable to linear elastic indentation. We compiled a series of synergistic strategies into an algorithm that overcomes many of the complications that have previously impeded efforts to automate the fitting of contact mechanics models to indentation data.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the effectiveness of both a hand hygiene message campaign and the use of an <b>alcohol</b> <b>gel</b> hand sanitizer in decreasing the incidence of upper respiratory illness (URI) among students living in university residence halls. Methods: This study involved a total of 430 students recruited from four residence halls during the Fall Semester at the University of Colorado at the Boulder campus. Dormitories were paired into control and product groups. In the product groups, <b>alcohol</b> <b>gel</b> hand sanitizer dispensers were installed in every room and bathroom and in dining halts. The data were statistically analyzed for the differences between product and control groups in reported symptoms, illness rates, and absenteeism from classes. Results: The overall increase in hand hygiene behavior and reduction in symptoms, illness rates, and absenteeism between the product group and control group was stetistically significant. Reductions in URI symptoms ranged from 14. 8 % to 39. 9 %. Total improvement in illness rate was 20. 0 %. The product group had 43 % less missed schooVwork days. Conc/usion: Hand hygiene practices were improved through increased frequency of handwashing through increasing awareness of the importance of hand hygiene, and the use of <b>alcohol</b> <b>gel</b> hand sanitizer in university dormitories.

40|$|AFM micro- or nanoindentation is a {{powerful}} technique for mapping the elasticity of materials at high resolution. When applied to soft matter, however, its accuracy is equivocal. The sources of the uncertainty can be methodological or analytical in nature. In this paper, we address the lack of practicable nonlinear elastic contact models, which frequently compels the use of Hertzian models in analyzing force curves. We derive and compare approximate forceindentation relations based {{on a number of}} hyperelastic general strain energy functions. These models were applied to existing data from the spherical indentation of native mouse cartilage tissue as well as chemically crosslinked poly(vinyl <b>alcohol)</b> <b>gels.</b> For the biological tissue, the Fung and single-term Ogden models were found to provide the best fit of the data while the Mooney-Rivlin and van der Waals models were most suitable for the synthetic gels.

The Hertz model proved to be acceptable for the synthetic gels at small strains (< 20 % for the samples tested).

Baseline and intervention observations were completed over five 60 -minute periods (Monday-Friday) from 7 : 30 to 8 : 30 AM using a covert observation method.

Peppas and his students originated the novel muco- and bioadhesive systems that interact molecularly with the mucus and tissue and have been able to prolong bioavailability of proteins and peptides in the blood. As a result of his work, a number of biomedical polymers and commercial delivery devices have been launched. Peppas was the first to develop novel toxic-free poly(vinyl <b>alcohol)</b> <b>gels</b> by the freezing-thawing technique in 1975. These gels became very successful articular cartilage replacement systems. In 1978, he developed the same systems for in situ replacement of vocal cords. In 1979 his group pioneered the use of hydrogels in drug delivery applications, including epidermal bioadhesive systems and systems for the release of theophylline, proxyphylline, diltiazem, and oxprenolol. Peppas’ lab has developed new technologies of oral delivery systems for insulin and other proteins. These devices release insulin orally, “protecting” the insulin throughout its transport in the stomach, upper small intestine, and, eventually, blood, and bypassing diabetics’ need for several daily injections. The same technology has been used for the transmucosal (oral, buccal) delivery of calcitonin (for treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women) and interferon-alpha (for cancer therapy), and is being investigated for interferon-beta release for multiple sclerotic patients. [...] Peppas was one of the pioneers of intelligent biomaterials, and medical devices. Using intelligent polymers as early as 1980, Peppas and his group were the first to use such pH-sensitive and temperature-sensitive systems for modulated release of streptokinase and other fibrinolytic enzymes.|$|R
