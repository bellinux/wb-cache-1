5|$|In the Ashvamedhika Parva {{the tale}} is narrated with some variation. Uttanka is {{described}} as a brahmin who belonged to the Bhrigu race that lived in a hermitage in the Maru desert. Uttanka was the disciple of the sage Gautama, whom he served for a hundred years. Uttanka was very dear to Gautama, who did not let him go even after Uttanka had completed his education. Uttanka grew old over time. One day Uttanka collapsed while carrying a huge bundle of firewood. Gautama's daughter cried looking at the sight. When called by his guru, Uttanka accosted Gautama, and with tears in his eyes <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> alone had been retained in the hermitage when thousands of other disciples had been discharged after training. Gautama restored Uttanka's youth, gave his daughter in marriage to Uttanka and then permitted him to leave.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} weeks of the summer, Cisneros called Fischer several times and <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> had broken up with her daughter. He told her Cristina was very kind, {{but he wanted to}} be single and date other girls. Cisneros then called Fischer's father, Buddy, and asked him why his son had broken up with Cristina. Fischer was angry that Cristina did not return his ring, and wrote a letter to her saying that he wanted his ring in ten days, or he would take action. Cisneros then called Buddy and told him she wanted to talk about his son's ring and other things; both agreed to meet at a Burger King. Cisneros asked Buddy why Fischer broke up with Cristina, and Buddy said that was between his son and her. He said his son was old enough to make his own decisions, and that he would not get involved. Cisneros then asked him if he knew Fischer drank, and he responded that at his son's age it was not {{uncommon}} to drink. Cisneros then said she had seen Fischer drunk once before, but his father responded by saying if he had been drunk before, it was not in his presence. Sex never came up in the conversation. Buddy told Cisneros he would speak to his son about acting like a gentleman; Cisneros promised to return Fischer's ring. Buddy recalled the meeting was awkward but friendly.|$|E
25|$|In {{the autumn}} of the {{following}} year, heavy flooding occurred in many commanderies, with Yan Province being the worst hit. Xun Xu wrote a memorial to Emperor Wu and suggested that he create {{the office of a}} dushui shizhe (都水使者; an official in charge of waterworks) to deal with floods in the future. Later, on a separate occasion, he appointed his subordinates Yin Xian (伊羨) and Zhao Xian (趙咸) as Members of the Retinue (舍人) and tasked them with drafting legislation. When Emperor Wu <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> did so, Xun Xu explained the importance of delegating responsibilities to subordinates. He also pointed out why he believed it was redundant to have officials focusing on drafting legislation only since their duties overlap with those of other officials, so it was better to delegate such additional responsibilities to the latter group.|$|E

25|$|A banquet {{was soon}} held in Han's honor for this success. During this banquet, Han met his future wife, Liang Hongyu. Liang Hongyu was a {{military}} courtesan and was serving the officers in the banquet. It is said that Liang {{caught the eye of}} Han who was sighing instead of celebrating like the others. Liang approached Han and <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> wasn't showing any signs of joy in the banquet which was thrown in his honor. Han replied that this was a small victory and that he was worried about the Jurchens who showed signs of hostility to the Song regime. He stated that it hurt him to imagine the damage that war may bring upon the peasants. Liang was in awe of Han, and the two quickly become very close to each another. Liang decided to follow Han and the two soon were married.|$|E
25|$|Tabari writes, “God created Adam {{with his}} own hands so that God could say to Iblis (Satan) that he was exalting himself over that which God formed {{with his own}} hands. So God created Adam as a human and his body was from clay. God breathed his spirit into Adam. Then when God’s spirit entered his eyes he saw the fruits of Paradise and when it entered his stomach he was hungry, so before the spirit reached his feet {{he tried to get}} up in haste to have the fruits of Paradise. This is the meaning of God’s word: “Man was created in haste” (21:37) In regards to the testing of Adam and Eve, Ibn Ishaq writes, “Iblis started off by crying for Adam and Eve, and they became sad when they heard him. They <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> was crying and he said, “I am crying for you because you will die and be forced to give up the luxury and plenty you are enjoying.” Then Iblis went to them and whispered saying, “Adam, may I lead you to the Tree of Immortality and to a kingdom that does not decline?” (20:120) Meaning that they might become angels or live forever in Paradise. In the Qur'an it states, “When we took from the prophets their {{covenant}} from you, Noah, Abraham, and Jesus son of Mary. We took from them a solemn covenant” (Q 33:7) That covenant was, as quoted by Ibn Abbas “The Prophet Muhammad said, “God took a covenant from the back of Adam on the day of ‘Arafat. He caused all of his offspring to come out of him, and spread them out in front of him. In regards to Adam’s death, Tabari writes, “When Adam died it was Friday. The angels came to him, sent by God from Paradise, to embalm and wrap him, and they honored his son and heir Seth. Ibn Ishaq says: The sun and the moon were eclipsed for seven days and nights.|$|E

500|$|In {{the preface}} to The Man-Eating Myth, Arens notes that he was first {{inspired}} to begin a fuller investigation of cannibalism while teaching an introductory course on anthropology at Stony Brook University, New York. One student <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> focused his teaching on such topics as kinship, politics and economics rather than the more [...] "exotic" [...] subjects of witchcraft, fieldwork experiences and cannibalism. Arens concurred that these latter topics would interest his students {{to a greater extent}} than those which he was then lecturing on, and so undertook an investigation into the prior accounts of cannibalism in the anthropological record.|$|E

500|$|Yankovic {{wanted to}} include the song {{on one of his}} albums, since the demo version had been so popular. However, the long and {{involved}} process of getting permission from both George Lucas and the publishers of the Kinks' [...] "Lola" [...] delayed the physical release of the song for about five years. Although Lucas eventually gave Yankovic permission, the song's publishers turned Yankovic down. [...] "Yoda" [...] might have remained unreleased {{had it not been for}} a chance encounter between Yankovic and Ray Davies, who wrote [...] "Lola". When Yankovic <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> had not given his permission, Davies responded that he had never been asked. Davies ultimately gave Yankovic permission to record the song, and the song was later released on Yankovic's third album Dare to Be Stupid. For subsequent parodies, Yankovic has attempted to approach the songwriters themselves for permission rather than their publishers whenever possible.|$|E
500|$|In November 1997 at {{a conference}} in Princeton University Hata was confronted by Iris Chang, author of the book The Rape of Nanking, who <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> doubted the {{testimony}} of Japanese POWs who had stated that hundreds of thousands of Chinese were killed in the atrocity. When Hata replied that torture and coercion of Japanese POWs made their testimony unreliable Chang walked out and the audience became unruly, shouting Hata down and yelling insults at him. The moderator Perry Link barely kept the situation under control. In the wake of this incident, similar disruptions by Chinese students who disagreed with his death toll estimate prevented Hata from speaking at a number of universities that he visited. Bob Wakabayashi of York University argues that Hata became more strident in his tone following these attacks, once calling it the [...] "Nanking industry" [...] in comparison with Norman Finkelstein's [...] "Holocaust industry". In the 1980s Hata had stated that the death toll was 38,000 to 42,000 while holding out the possibility that it might have been as high as 60,000, but when he wrote the second edition of Nankin Jiken in 2007 he indicated that 42,000 massacred was the maximum possible and that the true number might have been lower.|$|E
500|$|Since February 2013, he {{had been}} {{receiving}} monthly disability payments of $1,652, though he had not sought treatment at any VA Medical Center facility. Gonzalez lived in Cooperas Cove, near Fort Hood, Texas, until {{a few weeks before}} the incident. Neighbours described him as [...] "friendly and big-hearted", but stated that in the months before he left the town, his behaviour had become paranoid, and unpredictable. Believing that someone would break into his home, Gonzalez started carrying a gun when walking his dogs, and installed extra security at his house, also choosing to leave his Christmas lights up as they [...] illuminated his property. He told a neighbour that children made him nervous, because he had seen children with bombs strapped to them during the war. When a friend <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> had not been answering his cell phone, Gonzales explained that he had placed it in the microwave; he thought the government was trying to bug his house. He lived without electricity in the weeks before he left the town to move to a campground. In February 2013, Gonzalez called the police to report a burglary. When police arrived at his house they found him patrolling his front yard with an assault rifle, handgun and a knife. Gonzalez told police there were cameras and listening devices in his house that were secretly recording him.|$|E
