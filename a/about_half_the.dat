5|$|As {{a result}} of 1990s UK local {{government}} reform, York regained unitary status and saw a substantial alteration in its borders, taking in parts of Selby and Harrogate districts, and <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> population of the Ryedale district. The new boundary was imposed after central government rejected the former city council's own proposal.|$|E

5|$|Clashes in {{the capital}} between Habré's FAN and pro-Libyan groups became {{progressively}} more serious. On 22 March 1980, a minor incident, as in 1979, triggered the second battle of N'Djamena. In ten days, the clashes between the FAN and Goukouni's FAP, which both had 1,000–1,500 troops in the city, caused thousands of casualties and the flight of <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> capital's population. The few remaining French troops, who left on 4 May, proclaimed themselves neutral, as did the Zairean peace force.|$|E
5|$|For {{the size}} of limitanei units, opinion is divided. Jones and Elton suggest from the scarce and {{ambiguous}} literary evidence that border legiones numbered c. 1,000 men and that the other units contained {{in the region of}} 500 men each. Others draw on papyrus and more recent archaeological evidence to argue that limitanei units probably averaged <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> Jones/Elton strength i.e. c. 500 for legiones and around 250 for other units.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Bell {{began to}} lay off workers on the V-22 {{production}} line following the implementation of defense cuts, which had reduced the US order to <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> originally planned number of aircraft. Production rate went from 40 in 2012 to 22 planned for 2015. Manufacturing robots have replaced older automated machines for increased accuracy and efficiency in production.

5|$|One {{of the few}} notable {{differences}} between the chemistry of yttrium {{and that of the}} lanthanides is that yttrium is almost exclusively trivalent, whereas <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> lanthanides can have valences other than three; nevertheless, only for four of the fifteen lanthanides are these other valences important in aqueous solution (CeIV, SmII, EuII, and YbII).|$|E
5|$|Several {{chromium}} compounds {{are used}} as catalysts for processing hydrocarbons. For example, the Phillips catalyst, prepared from chromium oxides, {{is used for the}} production of <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> world's polyethylene. Fe-Cr mixed oxides are employed as high-temperature catalysts for the water gas shift reaction. Copper chromite is a useful hydrogenation catalyst.|$|E
5|$|Shark skeletons {{are very}} {{different}} from those of bony fish and terrestrial vertebrates. Sharks and other cartilaginous fish (skates and rays) have skeletons made of cartilage and connective tissue. Cartilage is flexible and durable, yet is <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> normal density of bone. This reduces the skeleton's weight, saving energy. Because sharks do not have rib cages, they can easily be crushed under their own weight on land.|$|E

5|$|The Austrians {{fell back}} into Alessandria, having lost <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> forces they had committed. The Austrians had lost heavily in the 12 hours of fighting: 15 colours, 40 guns, almost 8,000 taken prisoner, and 6,500 dead or wounded. French {{casualties}} (killed and wounded) were {{on the order of}} 4,700 and 900 missing or captured, but they retained the battlefield and the strategic initiative. Desaix's body was found among the slain.|$|E
5|$|The Javan {{rhinoceros}} never {{fared well}} in captivity. The oldest {{lived to be}} 20, <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> age that the rhinos can reach in the wild. No records are known of a captive rhino giving birth. The last captive Javan rhino died at the Adelaide Zoo in Australia in 1907, where the species was so little known {{that it had been}} exhibited as an Indian rhinoceros.|$|E
5|$|The first comet whose orbit {{had been}} found to take it {{extremely}} close to the Sun was the Great Comet of 1680. This comet {{was found to have}} passed just 200,000km (0.0013AU) above the Sun's surface, equivalent to <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> distance between the Earth and the Moon. It thus became the first known sungrazing comet. Its perihelion distance was just 1.3 solar radii.|$|E

5|$|While Nike-X {{could be}} {{expected}} to attack these with a reasonable 1 to 1 exchange ratio, compared to Zeus' 20 to 1, it could only do so over a limited area. Most nationwide deployment scenarios contained thousands of Sprint missiles protecting only the largest US cities. Such a system would cost an estimated $40 billion to build ($ billion in , <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> annual military budget).|$|E
5|$|While {{almost all}} jumping spiders are predators, mostly preying on insects, on other spiders, {{and on other}} arthropods, Phaeacius does not use the usual hunting tactics. Most jumping spiders walk {{throughout}} the day, so that they maximise their chances of a catch, and jump on their prey and then bite it. Unlike most jumping spiders, Phaeacius and other spartaeines do not leap on prey, but lunge from <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> predator's body length away.|$|E
5|$|All {{surviving}} Croat {{civilians were}} {{expelled from the}} area of Hrvatska Dubica on 20 November. At least 118 Croat and other non-Serb civilians were killed in Baćin and its vicinity by February 1992. By 1995, numerous Croat-owned houses in Hrvatska Dubica, all Croat-owned houses in Cerovljani and <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> Croat-owned houses in Baćin were torched, dynamited or otherwise destroyed.

5|$|Bismuth {{compounds}} {{account for}} <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> production of bismuth. They {{are used in}} cosmetics, pigments, and a few pharmaceuticals, notably bismuth subsalicylate, used to treat diarrhea. Bismuth's unusual propensity to expand upon freezing is responsible for some of its uses, such as in casting of printing type. Bismuth has unusually low toxicity for a heavy metal. As the toxicity of lead has become more apparent in recent years, there is an increasing use of bismuth alloys (presently {{about a third of}} bismuth production) as a replacement for lead.|$|E
5|$|Both {{environmental}} factors and genetics {{are associated with}} alcoholism with <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> risk attributed to each. A person with a parent or sibling with alcoholism is {{three to four times}} more likely to be alcoholic themselves. Environmental factors include social, cultural, and behavioral influences. High stress levels, anxiety, as well as inexpensive easily accessible alcohol increases risk. People may continue to drink partly to prevent or improve symptoms of withdrawal. A low level of withdrawal may last for months following stopping. Medically, alcoholism is considered both a physical and mental illness. Both questionnaires and certain blood tests may detect people with possible alcoholism. Further information is then collected to confirm the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Coat color {{ranges from}} almost pure white through various shades of blond, cream, and ochre to grays, browns, and blacks, with {{variation}} in fur color tending {{to increase in}} higher latitudes. Differences in coat color between sexes are largely absent, though females may have redder tones. Black-colored wolves in North America inherited the Kb allele responsible for melanism from past interbreeding with dogs, while the mutation {{was found to be}} naturally occurring in wolves from Iran. Black specimens are more common in North America than in Eurasia, with <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> wolves in Yellowstone National Park being black.|$|E
