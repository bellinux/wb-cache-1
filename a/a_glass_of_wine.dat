5|$|The {{title of}} the book comes from an essay {{published}} in 1964 and reprinted in An Omelette and <b>a</b> <b>Glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wine,</b> and is a reference to South Wind, a novel by David's greatly loved friend Norman Douglas.|$|E
5|$|A further réchauffé, drawn principally from Mediterranean Food, Italian Food, French Provincial Cooking and An Omelette and <b>a</b> <b>Glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wine.</b> Sections are headed, Soups, Small dishes, Salads, Pasta, gnocchi & polenta, Rice, beans & lentils, Main dishes, Breads, and Desserts. Recipes {{range from}} aillade toulousaine (garlic and walnut sauce) and Angevin salad (lettuce and endive with Gruyère or Emmenthal cheese) to {{watercress}} and potato soup and zuppa pavese (bread and egg soup). The book was illustrated with photographs by Kristin Perers, {{and published by}} Quadrille.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{research}} David undertook for English Bread and Yeast Cookery was done with Jill Norman, her friend and publisher. The pair decided that they should produce two further books: Ice and Ices {{and a collection of}} David's early journalism. Like her book on bread, the scope for Ice and Ices grew the more David researched the subject. The compilation of existing essays and press articles took less time, and in 1984 An Omelette and <b>a</b> <b>Glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wine</b> was published, edited by Norman who became David's literary executor and edited further David works after the author's death.|$|E

5|$|The {{successive}} updates of Le Cuisinier roïal et bourgeois include important refinements such as adding <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> to fish stock. Definitions {{were also}} {{added to the}} 1703 edition. The 1712 edition, retitled Le Nouveau cuisinier royal et bourgeois, was increased to two volumes, and was written in a more elaborate style with extensive explanations of technique. Additional smaller preparations are included in this edition as well, leading to lighter preparations, and adding a third course to the meal. Ragout, a stew still central to French cookery, makes its first appearance as a single dish in this edition as well; prior to that, it was listed as a garnish.|$|E
5|$|As {{an obsessive}} new mother {{who has spent}} many an hour {{hovering}} over my son with a thermometer and a pre-emptive bottle of Calpol, Rachel's contention that she didn't {{want to go out}} for dinner with Adam because she couldn't bear to leave three-month-old Matthew in the care of their best friend's children's nanny was just one niggling implausibility too far. After three months of being on baby duty 24 hours a day, every woman I've ever come across has, ordinary guilt aside, all but wept with joy at the prospect of a bowl of pasta and <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> consumed somewhere other than Babyville. None of which would matter a jot, of course, had Cold Feet not been feted for reflecting the lives of its target audience.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to those in Italian Food, there are many Italian recipes and descriptions {{of the land and}} the people in David's other works. The first recipe in her first book, Mediterranean Food—soupe au Pistou—is of Genoese origin. Also in that book are recipes for bocconcini, osso bucco, and several Italian pasta and chicken dishes. Among the recipes in Summer Cooking is peperonata (pimentos or sweet peppers cooked with tomatoes in olive oil and butter) which was reprinted as the title article in a later selection from David's works. In An Omelette and <b>a</b> <b>Glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wine,</b> David printed Italian recipes including soups and omelettes made with hops (zuppa di lupolli and frittata con i loertis). Also in that book are substantial essays on Italian people and places. Is There a Nutmeg in the House? includes a six-page article on vegetable dishes from Mantua, and another of similar length on the variations of pizza in Italy and beyond.|$|E

However, her secret bribery comes out {{on the eve of the}} election and she loses the election and twelve donors towards her foundation. Facing the possibility of jail and the overall humiliation and disgrace, she pours herself <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> (in the original series, her favorite tipple was Vodka). Yet, before she can drink it J.R. and John Ross arrive, with J.R. vowing to make things right by her and reminding her that she is a strong woman. After they leave she dumps out the wine and instead seeks comfort in Ann. J.R. through means of blackmail is able to get the charges dropped and after thanking him, Sue Ellen invites him in for tea, a spark of their past romance being seemingly reignited. Later she comes to the aid of John Ross and helps him in securing control of the newly established Ewing Energies, by pushing his ex-girlfriend Elena Ramos out of the company. Despite pleas from Bobby, Ann, and Christopher she does so.|$|E
5|$|South Wind Through the Kitchen (1997) was the {{completion}} {{of one of the}} projects of David's later years on which she worked with Norman: a single-volume collection of the best of her extensive writings. Norman invited chefs, writers and David's friends to choose their favourite of her articles and recipes. Many of the contributors, such as the chef Simon Hopkinson, contributed an introduction or afterword to the pieces they chose. The extracts and recipes are taken from all David's books published by 1996. There are more than 200 recipes, organised in the customary way with sections on courses and ingredients—eggs and cheese, fish and shellfish, meat, poultry and game, vegetables, pasta, pulses and grains, sauces, sweet dishes and cakes, preserves, and bread—interspersed, as in David's earlier works, with articles and essays. The title of the book comes from an essay published in 1964 and reprinted in An Omelette and <b>a</b> <b>Glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wine,</b> and is a reference to South Wind, a novel by David's mentor Norman Douglas.|$|E

25|$|A {{few weeks}} after Roberts' capture, the Royal James had to be {{abandoned}} because of worm damage. The Royal Rover headed for the island of Príncipe. Davis hoisted the flags of a British man-of-war and was allowed to enter the harbour. After a few days, Davis invited the governor to lunch on board his ship, intending to hold him hostage for a ransom. Davis had to send boats to collect the governor, and {{he was invited to}} call at the fort for <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> first. The Portuguese had discovered that their visitors were pirates. They ambushed Davis' party {{on its way to the}} fort, shooting Davis dead.|$|E
25|$|St. Lucy is also {{popular among}} {{children}} {{in some regions}} of North-Eastern Italy, namely Trentino, East Lombardy (Bergamo, Brescia, Cremona, Lodi and Mantua), parts of Veneto, (Verona), parts of Emilia-Romagna, (Piacenza, Parma, Reggio Emilia and Bologna), and all of Friuli, where {{she is said to}} bring gifts to good children and coal to bad ones the night between 12 and 13 December. According to tradition, she arrives {{in the company of a}} donkey and her escort, Castaldo. Children are asked to leave some coffee for Lucia, a carrot for the donkey and <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> for Castaldo.

She is briefly overcome with faintness, and Rodolfo helps her to a chair and offers her <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine.</b> She thanks him.

25|$|The {{rift between}} Gordon and Sievers climaxed on 14 July 1721 when, at a banquet commemorating {{the battle of}} 'Hango Head,' a violent quarrel broke out {{between the two men}} in the {{presence}} of the Tsar. Gordon complained about the Dane’s behaviour towards him and pointed out that, as Seivers was responsible for the appointments of lieutenants and all inferiors, he was appointing the best officers and men to the Danish and Dutch commanders. The General-Admiral, Count Apraxin, did his best to justify the actions of Rear Admiral Sievers and maintained that Gordon had falsely accused him of partiality when dividing the officers and men. During his conversation he referred to Gordon as ‘your admiral’ to Peter the Great which was not well received. As Sievers was going to leave the Tsar’s service at the end of the campaign, it was left like that. The next day Peter called the two admirals together and made them drink <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> together hoping that this would end their bickering.|$|E

500|$|The comedy actor John Bannister became acting-manager in 1802. With Sheridan's son Tom, and in {{the circle}} of Richard Wroughton (stage-manager), William Dowton, Michael Kelly, Tom Dibdin and their likes, he helped to see the Theatre Royal through its next catastrophe. On 24 February 1809, despite the {{previously}} mentioned fire safety precautions, the theatre burned down. On being encountered drinking <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> in the street while watching the fire, R.B. Sheridan was famously reported to have said: [...] "A man may surely be allowed to take <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> by his own fireside." [...] Already on the shakiest financial ground, Sheridan was ruined entirely by the loss of the building. He turned to brewer Samuel Whitbread, an old friend, for help. As well as investing strongly in the project, Whitbread agreed to head a committee that would manage the company and oversee the rebuilding of the theatre, but asked Sheridan to withdraw from management himself, which he did entirely by 1811.|$|E

500|$|The Times {{described}} {{the book as}} [...] "this serenely unhurried gathering of essays, book reviews, pamphlets, travellers' tales and cookery articles. The food writer Alan Davidson spoke of David's [...] "intellectual vitality, her amazing memory for detail, her passionate interest in getting everything right, her feeling for style in the larger sense," [...] qualities that the chef Rowley Leigh found demonstrated in An Omelette and <b>a</b> <b>Glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wine.</b>|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the recipes}} in David's early books were revised {{versions}} of her articles previously published in magazines and newspapers, and in An Omelette and <b>a</b> <b>Glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wine</b> (1984) she collected her favourites among her articles and presented them unedited with her afterthoughts appended. A second volume of reprinted articles was published after her death. [...] David's biographer, Artemis Cooper, wrote, [...] "She was hailed {{not only as}} Britain's foremost writer on food and cookery, but as {{the woman who had}} transformed the eating habits of middle-class England." ...|$|E

Not available elsewhere, by contrast, were booklets by David printed specially for the shop.
