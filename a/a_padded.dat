5|$|Bobby Roode, who was {{accompanied}} by Coach D'Amore, fought Lance Hoyt in the following encounter. D'Amore interfered in the contest several times by distracting Hoyt, the referee, or aiding Roode in some way. Roode won the bout after performing his signature Northern Lariat maneuver at 7 minutes and 24 seconds. After the bout, Hoyt performed a backflip splash {{from the top of}} <b>a</b> <b>padded</b> turnbuckle onto a prone D'Amore in the ring.|$|E
5|$|Bresnahan also {{developed}} the first batting helmet. He {{was hit in}} the head with a pitch by Andy Coakley of the Cincinnati Reds on June 18, 1907. Bresnahan was unconscious, and a Catholic priest read him his last rites. Bresnahan was hospitalized for ten days, during which time he developed schematics for a plastic batting helmet, though this piece of equipment did not become commonplace until the 1940s. Bresnahan was also the first catcher to wear <b>a</b> <b>padded</b> facemask while catching.|$|E

5|$|Next was the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament finals for {{the vacant}} TNA World Tag Team Championship between LAX, {{accompanied}} by Guerrero and Salinas, and Team 3D. The duration was eleven minutes and thirty seconds. Devine tried {{to interfere in}} the contest by setting up a table for Team 3D, but Guerrero stopped him {{and set up the}} table for himself outside the ring, placing Devine on top. Guerrero then climbed <b>a</b> <b>padded</b> turnbuckle and jumped onto Devine with a diving foot stomp, forcing him through the table. In the ring, Team 3D performed one of their signature tag team maneuvers, the 3D II, forcing Homicide into the mat and following with a cover, but the referee refused to count because Homicide was not the legal man in the contest. Hernandez then performed his signature Border Toss maneuver on Devon, slamming him into the mat from the top of a turnbuckle. Homicide followed with a splash from the top of <b>a</b> <b>padded</b> turnbuckle on Devon for the pinfall victory, winning the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament and the vacant TNA World Tag Team Championship.|$|E

5|$|A.J. Styles fought Kurt Angle in a Last Man Standing match next. In a Last Man Standing match, {{there are}} no {{disqualifications}} or count outs, instead to win the match the competitor has to force their opponent to {{not be able to}} reach a standing position by the count of 10. However, this match was only promoted as a Last Man Standing match, instead it was held under Texas Death match rules where a wrestler must pin or submit their opponent and then have them fail to respond to a count of 10. Styles got the first fall of the night, when he forced Angle to tap out to Angle's own signature submission maneuver the Ankle lock. Angle made it to his feet before the count concluded. Angle gained a pinfall later on in the match after slamming Styles off the top of <b>a</b> <b>padded</b> turnbuckle with a suplex. Before Styles could reach his feet to beat the count, Angle slammed Styles onto the mat back-first with his signature Olympic slam maneuver and gained another pinfall to start the count over. Styles beat that count as well, with Angle trying for the Olympic Slam again before Styles' countered it into his signature Styles' Clash maneuver and pinned Angle. After Angle reached his feet, Styles and Angle fought up <b>a</b> <b>padded</b> turnbuckle with Styles gaining the advantage. At this time, Styles grabbed Angle by the neck and fell backwards from the turnbuckle and drove Angle head-first into the mat. Angle failed to reach the 10 count afterwards, with Styles being declared the winner of the contest at 24 minutes and 50 seconds. Following the encounter, the referee called for medical attention for Angle who was scripted to appear as if he had suffered a neck injury. Styles then entered the ring once Angle reached his feet and lifted Angle up and dropped him on his head. As Styles walked up the ramp, he was attacked by Sting, who drove Styles' head into the ramp with his signature Scorpion Death Drop maneuver, as Kevin Nash looked on.|$|E
5|$|Christian Cage fought Monty Brown next to {{determine}} the number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. This bout lasted 12 minutes and 32 seconds. In the beginning the two fought at ringside, until Cage jumped {{from the top of}} <b>a</b> <b>padded</b> turnbuckle onto Brown with an aerial splash. After this, Cage removed the padding from one of the turnbuckles. Brown gained a two-count on Cage after slamming him against the mat with his signature Alpha Bomb maneuver and covered for the pin, but the referee had a delayed reaction. Later, Cage caused Brown to run into the exposed turnbuckle, he then followed by forcing Brown's face into the mat with his signature Unprettier maneuver. He then pinned Brown to become the number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

Scully, after learning that Skinner knows about their earlier conversation with Burks, calls him and Fowley liars and leaves. Scully is about to find a surveillance camera in the X-Files office when she is called by Sandoz telling her that the artifact contains information on human genetics. Sandoz is killed by Krycek shortly afterwards. Scully then heads to the West African Coast where she discovers that the artifact is part of a large spacecraft partially buried in the beach.|$|E
5|$|Two major {{innovations}} that revolutionised {{the effectiveness of}} mounted warriors in battle were the saddle and the stirrup. Riders quickly learned to pad their horse's backs {{to protect themselves from}} the horse's spine and withers, and fought on horseback for centuries with little more than a blanket or pad on the horse's back and a rudimentary bridle. To help distribute the rider's weight and protect the horse's back, some cultures created stuffed padding that resembles the panels of today's English saddle. Both the Scythians and Assyrians used pads with added felt attached with a surcingle or girth around the horse's barrel for increased security and comfort. Xenophon mentioned the use of <b>a</b> <b>padded</b> cloth on cavalry mounts as early as the 4th century BC.|$|E
5|$|During Prohibition, Pflueger {{designed}} {{bars for}} private clubs {{such as the}} Stock Exchange Luncheon Club where members kept their personal bottles in small lockers behind the bar, and two bars for The Family, one at the Family Farm in Woodside and one at the clubhouse in San Francisco. Pflueger created a cocktail bar and nightclub for Frank Martinelli and Tom Gerun in 1931, the Bal Tabarin, featuring a stage for live music and colorful indirect lighting from above metal fins in the ceiling and behind curved metal strips upstage. When Prohibition ended in December 1933, Bal Tabarin received an immediate renovation by Pflueger along with a liquor license from the state. Pflueger was then asked to design cocktail lounges for several hotels, completing the Cirque for the Fairmont Hotel in 1935, adorned with finely painted murals by Esther Bruton, and in 1939, both the Patent Leather Bar for the St. Francis Hotel and the Top of the Mark for the Mark Hopkins Hotel. The Patent Leather Bar used a metal-finned ceiling much like that which Pflueger had installed above the audience at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland. <b>A</b> <b>padded,</b> serpentine bar snaked through the room's mirror, chrome and black leather decor. Ansel Adams was retained by C. Templeton Crocker {{to show off the}} new cocktail lounge in photographs.|$|E

40|$|Resilient railpads in {{a variety}} of {{materials}} and with different surface profiling have been tested in the laboratory and in track. A laboratory impact test based on that initially developed at the Battelle Columbus Laboratories provides a reliable ranking {{of the extent to which}} railpads attenuate dynamic strain in concrete sleepers in track. The test is also a good indication of the average attenuation provided by <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> in track. Ifdynamic loads in track are particularly severe the fractional attenuation provided by <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> is greater than that indicated by the laboratory impact test. Laboratory resonance apparatus, in which the pad is the principal resilient element in a simple dynamic system, has been made tofind the railpad’s effective dynamic stiffness. There is good correlation between the stiffness measured in track and that measured in this apparatus. <b>A</b> <b>pad’s</b> dynamic stiffness is consistently at least as great as its tangent stiffness foundfrom the static loadldeflection curve. The load/defection behaviour of <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> in track can be found from measurements in an assembly of rail and sleeper in the laboratory. ...|$|R
