5|$|Freshly cut onions often cause <b>a</b> <b>stinging</b> {{sensation}} {{in the eyes}} of people nearby, and often uncontrollable tears. This is caused by the release of a volatile gas, syn-propanethial-S-oxide, which stimulates nerves in the eye creating <b>a</b> <b>stinging</b> sensation. This gas is produced by a chain of reactions which serve as a defence mechanism: chopping an onion causes damage to cells which releases enzymes called alliinases. These break down amino acid sulfoxides and generate sulfenic acids. A specific sulfenic acid, 1-propenesulfenic acid, is rapidly acted on by a second enzyme, the lacrimatory factor synthase, producing the syn-propanethial-S-oxide. This gas diffuses through the air and soon reaches the eyes, where it activates sensory neurons. Lacrimal glands produce tears to dilute and flush out the irritant.|$|E
5|$|Cheating, where {{either a}} cleaner {{sometimes}} harms its client, or a predatory species mimics a cleaner, also occurs. Predatory cheating {{is analogous to}} Batesian mimicry, as where a harmless hoverfly mimics <b>a</b> <b>stinging</b> wasp, though with the tables turned. Some genuine cleaner fish, such as gobies and wrasse, have the same colours and patterns, in an example of convergent evolution. Mutual resemblance among cleaner fish is analogous to Mullerian mimicry, as where stinging bees and wasps mimic each other.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius repraesentaneus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to Lactarius scrobiculatus, which has latex that turns yellow when exposed to air, a different smell, <b>a</b> <b>stinging</b> flesh and a different reaction of the milk to alkali: in L.scrobiculatus the milk turns reddish-orange while that of L.representaneus does not change color. Lactarius uvidus also has a violet reaction {{but it has a}} different color and is not hairy at the margin of the cap. L.flavidus has a yellowish cap but does not have a hairy margin.|$|E
50|$|In {{experimental}} fluid mechanics, <b>a</b> <b>sting</b> is <b>a</b> {{test fixture}} on which models are mounted for testing, e.g. in a wind tunnel. <b>A</b> <b>sting</b> is usually <b>a</b> long shaft attaching to {{the downstream end}} of the model {{so that it does}} not much disturb the flow over the model. The rear end of <b>a</b> <b>sting</b> usuallyhas <b>a</b> conical fairing blending into the (wind tunnel) model support structure.|$|R

By way of change, I turn them out now with <b>a</b> <b>sting</b> in their head, like the common mosquito. Mosquitoes are much less dangerous than scorpions, but they're a deal more irritating.|$|R

5|$|Müllerian mimicry {{was first}} {{described}} by pioneering naturalist Fritz Müller. When a distasteful animal comes {{to resemble a}} more common distasteful animal, natural selection favours individuals that even very slightly better resemble the target. For example, many species of stinging wasp and bee are similarly coloured black and yellow. Müller's explanation of the mechanism for {{this was one of}} the first uses of mathematics in biology. He argued that a predator, such as a young bird, must attack at least one insect, say a wasp, to learn that the black and yellow colours mean <b>a</b> <b>stinging</b> insect. If bees were differently coloured, the young bird would have to attack one of them also. But when bees and wasps resemble each other, the young bird need only attack one from the whole group to learn to avoid all of them. So, fewer bees are attacked if they mimic wasps; the same applies to wasps that mimic bees. The result is mutual resemblance for mutual protection.|$|E
5|$|In late 1796, {{with the}} French Revolutionary Wars three years old, {{a major shift}} {{occurred}} in the conflict when the Kingdom of Spain, until that point {{an enemy of the}} French Republic, abruptly changed sides following the signing of the Treaty of San Ildefonso. This reversal forced the British Royal Navy to retire from the Mediterranean Sea to preserve its lines of communication, falling back to the mouth of the Tagus River near Lisbon. From the Tagus, pressure was placed on the Spanish Navy by the erstwhile British Mediterranean Fleet under Vice-Admiral Sir John Jervis, who organised a blockade of the main Spanish fleet base at Cádiz on the country's Southern Atlantic coast. This resulted in the Battle of Cape St. Vincent on 14 February 1797, when Jervis inflicted <b>a</b> <b>stinging</b> defeat on the Spanish fleet. The surviving Spanish ships limped back to Cádiz after the battle, and to ensure that they could not sail again without risking a repeat action, Jervis arranged a close blockade of the port so that by April there were 21 British ships of the line and numerous frigates watching the Spanish fleet at anchor.|$|E
25|$|Political {{writings}} discussed {{social issues}} {{and the power of}} corporations. Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward outlined other possible political and social orders, and Upton Sinclair, most famous for his muck-raking novel The Jungle, advocated socialism. Other political writers of the period included Edwin Markham, William Vaughn Moody. Journalistic critics, including Ida M. Tarbell and Lincoln Steffens were labeled The Muckrakers. Henry Brooks Adams' literate autobiography, The Education of Henry Adams also depicted <b>a</b> <b>stinging</b> description of the education system and modern life.|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>sting,</b> {{sometimes}} called <b>a</b> sounder, {{is a short}} musical phrase, primarily used in broadcasting and films {{as a form of}} punctuation. [...] For example, <b>a</b> <b>sting</b> might be used to introduce a regular section of a show, indicate the end of a scene, or indicate that a dramatic climax is imminent.|$|R
50|$|Most beekeepers also wear some {{protective}} clothing. Novice beekeepers usually wear {{gloves and}} a hooded suit or hat and veil. Experienced beekeepers sometimes elect {{not to use}} gloves because they inhibit delicate manipulations. The face and neck {{are the most important}} areas to protect, so most beekeepers wear at least a veil. Defensive bees are attracted to the breath, and <b>a</b> <b>sting</b> on the face can lead to much more pain and swelling than <b>a</b> <b>sting</b> elsewhere, while <b>a</b> <b>sting</b> on <b>a</b> bare hand can usually be quickly removed by fingernail scrape {{to reduce the amount of}} venom injected.|$|R

25|$|Venom is {{the defense}} of choice for many ants (family Formicidae). It is {{injected}} from an ovipositor that has been evolutionarily modified into <b>a</b> <b>stinging</b> apparatus. These ants release a complex venom mixture that can include histamine. Within the Formicinae subfamily, the stinger has been lost and instead the poison gland forcibly ejects the fluid of choice, formic acid. Some carpenter ants (genus Camponotus) also have mandibular glands that extend throughout their bodies. When these are mechanically irritated, the ant commits suicide by exploding, spilling out a sticky, entangling substance.|$|E
25|$|The city of Damascus {{remained}} a powerful muse in his poetry, {{most notably in}} the Jasmine Scent of Damascus. The 1967 Six-Day War also influenced his poetry and his lament for the Arab cause. The defeat marked a qualitative shift in Qabbani's work – from erotic love poems to poems with overt political themes of rejectionism and resistance. For instance, his poem Marginal Notes on the Book of Defeat, <b>a</b> <b>stinging</b> self-criticism of Arab inferiority, drew anger from both {{the right and left}} sides of the Arab political dialogue.|$|E
25|$|Robert E. Lee {{considered}} that the Union troops at Reams Station represented {{not only a}} threat to his supply line, {{but also to the}} county seat of Dinwiddie County; if Dinwiddie Court House were to fall, the Confederates would be forced to evacuate both Petersburg and Richmond because it represented a key point on the army's potential retreat route. He also saw an opportunity—that he could impose <b>a</b> <b>stinging</b> defeat on the Union Army not long before the presidential election in November. Lee ordered Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill to take the overall command of an expedition that included 8–10,000 men—both cavalry and infantry.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> bee <b>sting</b> is <b>a</b> <b>sting</b> from <b>a</b> bee (honey bee, bumblebee, sweat bee, etc.). The stings of most {{of these}} species can be quite painful, and are {{therefore}} keenly avoided by many people.|$|R

25|$|The maltreatment {{of cattle}} at the Smithfield Market {{prompted}} Elizabeth Heyrick in 1823 to publish anonymously <b>a</b> <b>stinging</b> rebuke to those acting cruelly {{as well as}} to what she perceived was an apparent lack of punitive action taken against the perpetrators. Heyrick's short work began with strong words directed at the supporters of Martin's Act for not prosecuting those who abused animals. However she seemed to be unaware that Broome had in 1822 already personally brought to court some individuals against whom charges of cruelty were heard. He also from his own pocket paid the salary for an inspector to monitor the abuse of animals at the Smithfield Market.|$|E
25|$|All catfish, except {{members of}} Malapteruridae (electric catfish), possess a strong, hollow, bony leading spine-like ray on their dorsal and {{pectoral}} fins. As a defense, these spines may be locked into place {{so that they}} stick outwards, which can inflict severe wounds. In several species catfish can use these fin rays to deliver <b>a</b> <b>stinging</b> protein if the fish is irritated. This venom is produced by glandular cells in the epidermal tissue covering the spines. In {{members of the family}} Plotosidae, and of the genus Heteropneustes, this protein is so strong it may hospitalize humans who are unfortunate enough to receive a sting; in Plotosus lineatus, the stings may result in death.|$|E
25|$|Previously, when then captain Bill Lawry drafted <b>a</b> <b>stinging</b> {{letter to}} the board {{critical}} of the arrangements that players {{had been forced to}} endure on the combined tours of India and South Africa in 1969–70, Redpath proposed that all the players should sign it. Lawry demurred, signing it only in his own name. This sealed the fate of Lawry’s career. Redpath {{was one of the few}} to survive that disastrous tour of South Africa with a reputation intact, averaging 47.17 in the four Tests. During an innings on tour of 152 against Orange Free State at Bloemfontein, he scored 32 runs off a six-ball over, which remains a record for any Australian in first class cricket.|$|E

25|$|With the Fort de Bellegarde secured, the Spanish army became {{able to use}} the Col de La Pertus as {{a supply}} route. Ricardos lunged at the capital of Rousillon but {{suffered}} <b>a</b> <b>stinging</b> repulse at the Battle of Perpignan on 17 July 1793. De Flers' French suffered 800 casualties {{out of a total of}} 12,000 troops. The French also lost one cannon and had 600 desertions. Out of 15,000 soldiers, the Spanish lost approximately 1,000 casualties. De Flers had used the month in which Ricardos reduced Bellegarde to train his green recruits and surround Perpignan with field fortifications. The French turned back Ricardos again in the Battle of Peyrestortes on 17 September, but the Spanish turned the tables on their opponents in the Battle of Truillas five days later.|$|E
25|$|After a {{continuing}} string of hit singles, many television appearances (including a notable and critically well-received TV special featuring {{the music of}} Rodgers and Hart), a successful third studio album (The Mamas and the Papas Deliver in March 1967), and the groundbreaking sociological impact of the Monterey International Pop Festival (which had been organized by John Phillips and Lou Adler) in June 1967, an ill-fated trip to England in October 1967 fragmented the already damaged group dynamic. Cass Elliot quit, after <b>a</b> <b>stinging</b> insult from John Phillips, (although she returned to complete her parts for the group's overdue fourth album, The Papas and the Mamas, which was finally released in May 1968). By then, Michelle Phillips {{had given birth to}} Chynna Phillips (in February 1968) and a formal statement had been released, announcing the group's demise.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1809, the Spanish army of Diego de Cañas y Portocarrero, Duke del Parque {{launched}} an offensive against the VI Corps. With Ney on leave, Marchand took command and suffered <b>a</b> <b>stinging</b> defeat at the Battle of Tamamés on 18 October 1809. With only 14,000 men and 14 artillery pieces, he tried to oust del Parque's 20,000 infantry, 1,500 cavalry, and 18 guns from a ridge. Sending Maucune's brigade to attack the Spanish left flank and the 25th Light Infantry to pin the enemy right flank, he planned to send the brigade of Pierre-Louis Binet de Marcognet to crush del Parque's center. Maucune's attack made considerable progress, but Marcognet's assault stalled {{in the face of}} heavy musketry and the fire of 12 cannons. Falling into confusion, Marcognet's men finally fled downhill and Marchand had to bring up Mathieu Delabassée's reserve brigade to prevent a rout. His corps suffered 1,400 casualties while the Spanish only lost half as many.|$|E

25|$|For much of 1863, the 1st Ohio was {{stationed}} in Tennessee and assigned to the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Division, XX Corps, Army of the Cumberland, until October when the IV Corps was formed from {{the remnants of the}} heavily depleted XX Corps and XXI Corps. Under the command of Maj. Joab A. Stafford, the regiment saw action at the Battle of Chickamauga, <b>a</b> <b>stinging</b> defeat for Rosecrans' army. It marched to Knoxville as part of the army relieving the Confederate siege of Union forces at that city. Yet another reorganization of the army resulted in the 1st OVI being assigned to the 2nd Brigade, 3rd Division, 4th Army Corps, Army of the Cumberland, until September 1864. It fought under Grant at Missionary Ridge, where the 1st OVI was the first regiment to plant its colors on the hilltop, and with Sherman in the Atlanta campaign. The regiment spent {{much of the rest of}} the fall on scouting duty in Tennessee.|$|E
25|$|Having {{cleared the}} Ebro valley, Suchet sent Musnier to fight guerillas to the north, while Laval battled the Spanish to the south. For the {{remainder}} of 1809, the III Corps waged local anti-guerilla operations. A January 1810 order of battle shows that Habert commanded Suchet's 3rd Division, though he still ranked as a general of brigade. Its strength was 4,329 men in seven battalions. At this time King Joseph Bonaparte insisted that Suchet capture Valencia. Accordingly, the III Corps commander advanced to the gates of that port city on 6 March, but within four days abandoned the futile blockade and retreated. Instead, Suchet advanced on Lleida (Lerida), arriving before the city on 15 April and inflicting <b>a</b> <b>stinging</b> repulse to a Spanish relief force on 23 April at Margalef. The French sat down to begin the Siege of Lerida on 29 April. During the operation, Habert's division included two battalions each of the 5th Light and 116th Line Infantry Regiments, three battalions of the 117th Line, and two foot artillery batteries. The Spanish governor Garcia Conde surrendered on 13 May with 7,000 men.|$|E
25|$|Kindelán {{enjoyed a}} return to favour of sorts in 1941 when he became Captain General of Catalonia, a {{promotion}} designed by Franco to improve the standing of the military as a buffer against the power of Ramón Serrano Súñer and the Falange. In November 1942, when Minister for the Army José Asensio was pushing for Spain to finally enter the war, Kindelán privately informed Franco that were this to happen he would personally overthrow Franco and restore the monarchy. Given that Kindelán enjoyed {{the support of a}} number of leading generals Franco initially did not react but after three months he removed Kindelán from his new position. Kindelán then served as head of the Escuela Superior del Ejército although he was sacked from this position in August 1945 after <b>a</b> <b>stinging</b> attack on Franco in a fiercely pro-monarchist speech. Meanwhile, his memoirs were delayed until 1945 and even then were censored due to a passage of fairly restrained criticism dealing with Franco's conduct of the war in the north.|$|E
