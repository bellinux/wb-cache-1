However, the exact opposite was true for informal writing. This suggests that perhaps the act of using textisms to shorten communication words leads young adults to produce more informal writing, which may then help them to be better [...] "informal" [...] writers. Due to text messaging, teens are writing more, and some teachers see that this comfort with language can be harnessed to make better writers. This new form of communication may be encouraging students to put their thoughts and feelings into words {{and this may be}} able {{to be used as a}} bridge, to get them more interested in formal writing.|$|R

Participants (N 124) were <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> <b>use</b> a wheelchair, live in the community, and were 50 years of age and older (X 59. 67, range 50 – 84), with at least 6 months of experience with manual wheelchair use; 60 % were men.

40|$|We {{investigated}} speech perception advantages {{arising from}} the use of inter-aural time difference cues, and from the provision of redundant information by the use of a hearing aid contralateral to a cochlear implant (bimodal hearing devices). Thirty-eight subjects (14 normally hearing and 23 hearing-impaired) participated in this study. The effect of binaural redundancy was assessed by comparing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) required for 50 % correct identification of sentences in noise when listening monaurally to that when listening binaurally. The use of inter-aural time difference cues was determined by comparing the binaural SNRs obtained with or without a noise delay of 700  µs between ears. Results indicated <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> <b>used</b> bimodal hearing devices benefited from binaural redundancy, but children did not.

40|$|Purpose. This study {{explored}} {{the perspectives of}} <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> <b>use</b> a speech generating device (SGD) {{on the development of}} a mentoring programme to improve device use. Adults who are competent SGD communicators would mentor new learners. The aims were to investigate the participants’ views on peer mentoring to improve SGD use, the critical components of an SGD mentoring programme and the issues that might facilitate the likelihood of a programme’s success. Method. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> <b>use</b> an SGD. These interviews were analysed for content themes. Results. Thematic analysis revealed that participants perceived that new SGD learners would benefit from mentoring by experienced SGD communicators. Participants considered benefits for new learners would include the opportunity to see successful use of an SGD and the opportunity to receive support and guidance from someone who has a shared experience of learning to use an SGD. Participants considered benefits for mentors to include the satisfaction gained from helping new learners. Participants suggested guidelines for establishing a programme and areas in which SGD mentors would require training. Conclusions. Participants indicated a need for a mentoring programme to improve SGD use. Such a programme might help address challenges that those new to learning an SGD encounter. 12 page(s...|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between social anxiety (SA) and cannabis use among {{adolescents and young}} adults is a highly debated topic. In this cross-sectional study, we tested whether cannabis use expectancies mediated the association between SA and cannabis use severity in a sample of 343 young adults (74. 3 % male) who used cannabis. They completed self-report measures for the screening of problematic cannabis use (Cannabis Use Problems Identification Test) and SA symptoms (Social Interaction Anxiety Scale and Social Phobia Scale). A multiple mediation analysis was used to test whether marijuana effect expectancies mediate SA effect on problematic cannabis use. SA was negatively associated with cannabis use severity in this sample, and we found evidence that cannabis use expectancies fully mediated this relationship.
