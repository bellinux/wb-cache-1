50|$|There are {{informal}} and formal <b>assessments</b> to monitor an individual's comprehension ability {{and use of}} comprehension strategies. Informal <b>assessments</b> are generally through observation {{and the use of}} tools, like story boards, word sorts, and interactive writing. Many teachers use Formative <b>assessments</b> to determine if a student has mastered content of the lesson. Formative <b>assessments</b> can be verbal as in a Think-Pair-Share or Partner Share. Formative <b>Assessments</b> can also be Ticket out the door or digital summarizers. Formal <b>assessments</b> are district or state <b>assessments</b> that evaluates all students on important skills and concepts. Summative <b>assessments</b> are typically <b>assessments</b> given {{at the end of a}} unit to measure a student's learning.|$|R

They serve as practice for students, just like a meaningful homework assignment. They check for understanding along the way and guide teacher decision making about future instruction.” [...] Formative <b>assessments</b> give teachers a chance to break down complex ideas into smaller understandable pieces. This allows teachers to correct “mistakes” and fine tune skills before summative <b>assessments.</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} interval-valued conditional probability <b>assessments</b> on finite families of conditional events. Based on the coherence principle of de Finetti, we give some preliminary results on precise and imprecise probability <b>assessments,</b> by recalling {{the properties of}} avoiding uniform loss (AUL), which coincides {{with the notion of}} g-coherence, and of coherence introduced by Walley. Among other results, we generalize to interval-valued <b>assessments</b> a connection property, obtained in a previous paper, for the set of precise coherent <b>assessments</b> on a finite family F of conditional events. More specifically, we prove that, with any pair of AUL interval-valued <b>assessments</b> X',X'' on F, we can associate an infinite class of AUL interval-valued imprecise <b>assessments</b> which are convex combination between X' and X'' and connect them. Then, we examine the extension of g-coherent imprecise <b>assessments.</b> We also give a result on totally coherent imprecise <b>assessments,</b> by examining its relationship with a necessary and sufficient condition of total coherence for interval-valued <b>assessments...</b>|$|R
25|$|Ecological risk <b>assessment</b> aims {{to source}} of {{contamination}} to exposure to a toxicity endpoint. This requires a risk assessor to identify and estimate exposure pathways. Tissue residue is the only approach that inherently accounts for toxicity due to multiple exposure pathways. There is also a need in risk <b>assessment</b> to understand the bioaccumulation of chemicals4, {{as well as a}} direct estimation of bioavailability. Modeling food web exposure is difficult in risk <b>assessment</b> and requires many assumptions but this uncertainty can be reduced through tissue residue. Tissue residue may also allow provide a link between ecological risk <b>assessment</b> and human health risk <b>assessment.</b>|$|E
