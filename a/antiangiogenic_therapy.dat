40|$|Renal cell {{carcinoma}} (RCC) is an immunogenic and proan-giogenic cancer, and <b>antiangiogenic</b> <b>therapy</b> {{is the current}} mainstay of treatment. Patients with RCC develop innate or adaptive resistance to <b>antiangiogenic</b> <b>therapy.</b> There {{is a need to}} identify biomarkers that predict therapeutic resistance and guide combination therapy. We assessed the interaction between <b>antiangiogenic</b> <b>therapy</b> and the tumor immune micro-environment and determined their impact on clinical outcome. We found that antiangiogenic therapy–treated RCC primary tumors showed increased infiltration of CD 4 þ and CD 8 þ T lymphocytes, which was inversely related to patient overall survival and progression-free survival. Furthermore, specimens from patients treated with <b>antiangiogenic</b> <b>therapy</b> showed higher infiltration of CD 4 þFOXP 3 þ regulatory T cells and enhanced expression of checkpoint ligand programed death-ligand 1 (PD-L 1). Both immunosuppressive features were cor-related with T-lymphocyte infiltration and were negatively related to patient survival. Treatment of RCC cell lines and RCC xenografts in immunodeficient mice with sunitinib also increased tumor PD-L 1 expression. Results from this study indicate that antiangiogenic treatment may both positively and negatively regulate the tumor immune microenvironment. These findings generate hypotheses on resistance mechanisms to <b>antiangiogenic</b> <b>therapy</b> and will guide the development of combination therapy with PD- 1 /PD-L 1 –blocking agents.

40|$|Objective: To {{review the}} current {{data on the}} {{prognostic}} and therapeutic implications of tumor angiogenesis in gastrointestinal cancers. Summary Background Data: Numerous studies have evaluated the prognostic value of tumor angiogenesis and the potential role of <b>antiangiogenic</b> <b>therapy</b> in various gastrointestinal cancers. Methods: A Medline literature search was conducted using "angiogenesis" or the names of various angiogenic factors {{in combination with the}} names of gastrointestinal cancers as the key words. Results: Several studies have demonstrated a significant prognostic impact of tumor microvessel density and tumor expression of angiogenic factors, in particular vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in various gastrointestinal cancers. A few studies have suggested that circulating VEGF might be a useful prognostic marker. However, results were not consistent across all studies and were limited by the retrospective nature of most studies. <b>Antiangiogenic</b> <b>therapy</b> {{has been shown to be}} effective against all common gastrointestinal cancers in preclinical studies, but currently there are few clinical data with regard to <b>antiangiogenic</b> <b>therapy</b> in gastrointestinal cancers. Conclusions: There is mounting evidence to suggest that assessment of tumor angiogenesis might provide a novel approach of prognostication in patients with gastrointestinal cancers.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Angiogenesis is an {{essential}} hallmark of cancer. Targeting angiogenesis has proven its efficacy in the modern therapeutic paradigm. HER 2 positive breast cancer, in particular, is a challenging disease in which resistance to standard therapy {{has been attributed to}} parallel and downstream signaling cascades including angiogenesis. This review explores the molecular mechanisms underlying crosstalk between HER 2 signaling and angiogenesis. It highlights the role of angiogenesis in the emerging resistance to anti-HER 2 therapy. It surveys the current repertoire of clinical trials involving use of combination of anti-HER 2 and <b>antiangiogenic</b> <b>therapies.</b> Finally, it entertains the hopes and challenges posed by this novel therapeutic approach. RECENT FINDINGS: HER 2 signaling upregulates angiogenesis at different levels and by different mechanisms. A large number of clinical trials were conducted in attempt to exploit the potential benefit of the combination. Results of early phase trials were promising. However, in the late phase clinical trials, the AVEREL trial did not demonstrate a consistent benefit for bevacizumab in the HER 2 positive breast cancer patient population. The BETH trial is ongoing and recruiting patients. Safety issues regarding cardiovascular toxicity of the combination have been already raised. Negative experience of dual EGFR and VEGF targeting in colon cancer cannot be overlooked. SUMMARY: Angiogenesis and HER 2 signaling are closely related at the molecular level.

40|$|Angiogenesis {{contributes}} to various pathological conditions. Due to the resistance against existing <b>antiangiogenic</b> <b>therapy,</b> {{an urgent need}} exists to understand the molecular basis of vessel growth and to identify new targets for <b>antiangiogenic</b> <b>therapy.</b> Here we show that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk 5), an important modulator of neuronal processes, regulates endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis, suggesting Cdk 5 as a novel target for <b>antiangiogenic</b> <b>therapy.</b> Inhibition or knockdown of Cdk 5 reduces endothelial cell motility and blocks angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. We elucidate a specific signaling of Cdk 5 in the endothelium; in contrast to neuronal cells, the motile defects upon inhibition of Cdk 5 are not caused by an impaired function of focal adhesions or microtubules but by the reduced formation of lamellipodia. Inhibition or down-regulation of Cdk 5 decreases {{the activity of the}} small GTPase Rac 1 and results in a disorganized actin cytoskeleton. Constitutive active Rac 1 compensates for the inhibiting effects of Cdk 5 knockdown on migration, suggesting that Cdk 5 exerts its effects in endothelial cell migration via Rac 1. Our work elucidates Cdk 5 as a pivotal new regulator of endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis.

This study was designed to define the malignant glioma cases most suitable for <b>antiangiogenic</b> <b>therapy</b> in humans and to demonstrate the efficacy of <b>antiangiogenic</b> <b>therapy</b> in animals. Protein expression of the most potent angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and its specific natural inhibitor, soluble Flt- 1, as well as vessel architecture, including vessel density, area, and diameter, was evaluated in human malignant glioma samples (24 glioblastomas, 13 anaplastic astrocytomas). Among these, VEGF > 1000 ng/ml, VEGF/soluble Fltl ratio > 1, vessel density > 30, and vessel area > 7 % were prognostic factors for malignant gliomas. Based on these results, we performed three different antiangiogenic experiments targeted to inhibit VEGF expression in a human malignant glioma (U 87) mouse model: anti-VEGF neutralized antibody intraperitoneal injection; interferon-beta intramusclar injection; and transfection of an endogenous nonspecific angiogenesis inhibitor, thrombospondin- 1, into glioma cells caused inhibition of VEGF secretion and/or mRNA expression and resulted in glioma growth inhibition of 70 %, 84 %, and 50 %, respectively, compared with control.
