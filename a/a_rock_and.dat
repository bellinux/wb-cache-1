5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the video, Katy and her boyfriend (played by actor and model Brian Nagel) have crashed their plane {{in the middle of the}} jungle. Katy shows signs of worry, while her boyfriend takes pictures of himself and dumps his bags on her to explore. As it turns to night, they wander through the jungle as he throws things back at her. Suddenly, he is attacked by a tiger and Katy dumps her bags and runs off screaming. She approaches a lake and is almost bitten by a crocodile when she tries to take a drink. She sits on <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> ends up with a tarantula crawling on her. As she looks into the lake while singing the chorus, she sees a reflection of a tiger instead of herself. Behind her in the darkness there are dozens of pairs of blinking eyes, but they are revealed to be fireflies which fly around her before forming an image of a roaring tiger in the sky.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, {{the band}} {{released}} {{the best of}} their early material as a compilation titled Crawl File, which peaked at numbertwo on the albums charts. Geffen released Semantics, internationally, as a long play album with six newly re-recorded tracks compiled from their first three studio albums. Promotion of the album and the subsequent tour was stalled when Guy McDonough died in June of viral pneumonia. Before Guy's death, he had recorded demos with his brother Bill McDonough, and ex-members of their earlier band, The Flatheads. Bill McDonough assembled the tapes and produced Guy McDonough's posthumous album My Place on Wheatley Records in April 1985. Tracks from these sessions were re-mastered and released on Lost & Found in 1996, credited under the 'Members of Australian Crawl' name. Meanwhile, remaining Australian Crawl members had recorded their fourth studio album, Between <b>a</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>and</b> a Hard Place, which was released in 1985 and achieved number11 on the albums charts. This was followed by the announcement that they would disband after another tour.

It begins with Shakira, dressed in a dark burgundy gown, coming across a pair of cheetahs in an arid desert region.

They are later seen prowling around her while she is standing atop <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> a bottle of Wild Elixir is then shown placed on a log of wood.

5|$|They reached Laodicea on the Lycus {{early in}} January 1148, {{around the same}} time Otto of Freising's army had been {{destroyed}} in the same area. Resuming the march, the vanguard under Amadeus of Savoy became separated {{from the rest of the}} army at Mount Cadmus, and Louis’ troops suffered heavy losses from the Turks. Louis himself, according to Odo of Deuil, climbed <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> was ignored by the Turks, who did not recognize him. The Turks did not bother to attack further and the French marched on to Adalia, continually harassed from afar by the Turks, who had also burned the land to prevent the French from replenishing their food, both for themselves and their horses. Louis no longer wanted to continue by land, and it was decided to gather a fleet at Adalia and sail for Antioch. After being delayed for a month by storms, most of the promised ships did not arrive at all. Louis and his associates claimed the ships for themselves, while the rest of the army had to resume the long march to Antioch. The army was almost entirely destroyed, either by the Turks or by sickness.|$|E
