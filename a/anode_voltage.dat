2500|$|Early LCC systems used mercury-arc valves, with {{designs that}} had evolved from those used on high power {{industrial}} rectifiers. [...] A number of adaptations {{were needed to}} make such valves suitable for HVDC, in particular the use of <b>anode</b> <b>voltage</b> grading electrodes to minimise the risk of arc-back at the very high reverse voltages experienced in HVDC. Much of the pioneering {{work in this area}} was performed in Sweden by Dr Uno Lamm, widely considered the “Father of HVDC” and in whose name the IEEE introduced the “Uno Lamm Award” for outstanding contributions in the field of HVDC. The very long anode columns needed for high voltage applications limited the current which could safely be carried by each anode, so most mercury-arc valves for HVDC used several (most often, four) anode columns in parallel per valve.|$|E

2500|$|Photomultiplier tubes {{typically}} utilize 1000 to 2000 volts {{to accelerate}} electrons within {{the chain of}} dynodes. (See Figure near top of article.) The most negative voltage {{is connected to the}} cathode, and the most positive voltage is connected to the anode. Negative high-voltage supplies (with the positive terminal grounded) are often preferred, because this configuration enables the photocurrent to be measured at the low voltage side of the circuit for amplification by subsequent electronic circuits operating at low voltage. However, with the photocathode at high voltage, leakage currents sometimes result in unwanted [...] "dark current" [...] pulses that may affect the operation. [...] Voltages are distributed to the dynodes by a resistive voltage divider, although variations such as active designs (with transistors or diodes) are possible. The divider design, which influences frequency response or rise time, can be selected to suit varying applications. Some instruments that use photomultipliers have provisions to vary the <b>anode</b> <b>voltage</b> to control the gain of the system.|$|E
2500|$|To {{combat the}} {{stability}} problems and limited voltage gain {{due to the}} Miller effect, the physicist Walter H. Schottky invented the tetrode tube in 1919. He showed that {{the addition of a}} second grid, located between the control grid and the plate (anode), known as the screen grid, could solve these problems. ("Screen" [...] in this case refers to electrical [...] "screening" [...] or shielding, not physical construction: all [...] "grid" [...] electrodes in between the cathode and plate are [...] "screens" [...] of some sort rather than solid electrodes since they must allow for the passage of electrons directly from the cathode to the plate). A positive voltage slightly lower than the plate (<b>anode)</b> <b>voltage</b> was applied to it, and was bypassed (for high frequencies) to ground with a capacitor. This arrangement decoupled the anode and the control grid, essentially eliminating the Miller capacitance and its associated problems. Consequently, higher voltage gains from a single tube became possible, reducing the number of tubes required in many circuits. This two-grid tube is called a tetrode, meaning four active electrodes, and was common by 1926.|$|E

5000|$|The tube was {{originally}} designed for mobile operations, so it's filament draws only 0.705 A of current, while anode power dissipation allowed {{is up to}} 40w, quite big for such low filament power.

2500|$|A modern display {{technology}} using {{a variation of}} cathode ray tube is often used in videocassette recorders, DVD players and recorders, microwave oven control panels, [...] and automotive dashboards. Rather than raster scanning, these vacuum fluorescent displays (VFD) switch control grids and <b>anode</b> <b>voltages</b> on and off, for instance, to display discrete characters. The VFD uses phosphor-coated anodes as in other display cathode ray tubes. Because the filaments are in view, they must be operated at temperatures where the filament does not glow visibly. This is possible using more recent cathode technology, and these tubes also operate with quite low <b>anode</b> <b>voltages</b> (often less than 50 volts) unlike cathode ray tubes. Their high brightness allows reading the display in bright daylight. VFD tubes are flat and rectangular, as well as relatively thin. Typical VFD phosphors emit {{a broad spectrum of}} greenish-white light, permitting use of color filters, though different phosphors can give other colors even within the same display. The design of these tubes provides a bright glow despite the low energy of the incident electrons. This is because the distance between the cathode and anode is relatively small.

5000|$|The anode {{characteristic}} of a screen-grid valve is thus quite unlike that of a triode. It includes a range of anode voltages, where the <b>anode</b> <b>voltage</b> is {{less than that of}} the screen grid, {{in which there is a}} distinctive negative resistance characteristic, sometimes called [...] "tetrode kink". This is usually undesirable, although it can be exploited as in the dynatron oscillator (Eastman, p 431). The approximately constant-current region of low slope at high <b>anode</b> <b>voltage</b> is also a distinctive characteristic of the tetrode. This is highly desirable, since it corresponds to a high source resistance in the anode circuit, and greatly enhances the voltage gain which the device can produce. Early screen-grid valves had amplification factors (i.e. the product of transconductance and anode slope resistance) ten times that of comparable small-signal triodes. [...] The high anode resistance (i.e. low slope) in the normal operating range is a consequence of the electrostatic shielding action of the screen grid, since it prevents the electric field due to the anode from penetrating to the control grid region, where it might otherwise influence the passage of electrons, increasing the electron current when the <b>anode</b> <b>voltage</b> is high, reducing it when low.In practice the negative-resistance kink of the {{anode characteristic}} limits the usefulness of the screen-grid valve to applications where only small signals are amplified, so that the variations in <b>anode</b> <b>voltage</b> are also correspondingly small, and the operating conditions never depart from the region of high positive impedance (low positive slope) at large <b>anode</b> <b>voltage.</b> The secondary emission can be prevented from contributing to the screen current (and thus detracting from the anode current) by adding a suppressor grid, making a pentode, or beam plates to make a beam tetrode/kinkless tetrode, which can be used in power amplifiers where the variations of <b>anode</b> <b>voltage,</b> due to the presence of a large signal voltage, are much greater. The anode characteristics of these tubes are very similar to pentodes. In both cases the anode current rises rapidly to an approximately constant value when the <b>anode</b> <b>voltage</b> rises to as little as a few tens of volts, and the region of high positive anode resistance (low slope) extends from this low value up to the maximum <b>anode</b> <b>voltage</b> which could be several hundred volts or more.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reason for}} the limited {{applicability}} of the screen-grid valve, and its rapid replacement by the RF pentode (introduced around 1930) was the peculiar anode characteristic (i.e. variation of anode current with respect to <b>anode</b> <b>voltage)</b> of the former type of tube.In normal applications, the <b>anode</b> <b>voltage</b> was about 150V, while that of the screen-grid was about 60V (Thrower p 183). [...] As the screen grid is positive {{with respect to the}} cathode, it collects a certain fraction (perhaps a quarter) of the electrons which would otherwise pass from the grid region to the anode. This causes current to flow in the screen grid circuit. Usually, the screen current due to this cause is small, and of little interest. However, if the <b>anode</b> <b>voltage</b> should be below that of the screen, the screen grid can also collect secondary electrons ejected from the anode by the impact of the energetic primary electrons. Both effects tend to reduce the anode current. If the <b>anode</b> <b>voltage</b> is increased from a low value, with the screen grid at its normal operating voltage (60V, say) the anode current initially increases rapidly because more of those electrons which pass through the screen-grid are collected by the anode rather than passing back to the screen grid. This part of the tetrode anode characteristic resembles the corresponding part of that of a triode or pentode. However, when the <b>anode</b> <b>voltage</b> is increased further, the electrons arriving at the anode have sufficient energy to cause copious secondary emission, and many of these secondary electrons will be captured by the screen, which is at a higher positive voltage than the anode. This causes the anode current to fall rather than increase when the <b>anode</b> <b>voltage</b> is increased. In some cases the anode current can actually become negative (current flows out of the anode); this is possible since each primary electron may produce more than one secondary. Falling positive anode current accompanied by rising <b>anode</b> <b>voltage</b> gives the anode characteristic a region of negative slope, and this corresponds to a negative resistance which can cause instability in certain circuits. In a higher range of <b>anode</b> <b>voltage,</b> the <b>anode</b> <b>voltage</b> sufficiently exceeds that of the screen for an increasing proportion of the secondary electrons to be attracted back to the anode, so the anode current increases once more, and the slope of the anode characteristic becomes positive again. In a yet higher range of anode voltages, the anode current becomes substantially constant, since all of the secondary electrons now return to the anode, and the main control of current through the tube is the voltage of the control grid. This is the normal operating mode of the tube.|$|E
