5|$|On December 1, 2008, President-elect Barack Obama {{announced}} {{his choice of}} Hillary Clinton, the junior U.S. Senator from New York, <b>as</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State.</b> Clinton was confirmed {{by a vote of}} 94-2 on January 21, 2009. Just hours before being sworn in <b>as</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State,</b> Clinton resigned her senate seat, effective immediately. This began a two-month search process to fill her vacant Senate seat. Under New York law, the governor appoints a replacement. A special election would then be held in November 2010 {{for the remainder of the}} full term, which ended in January 2013.|$|E
5|$|Calhoun, {{though as}} avid a proponent for Texas {{acquisition}} as Upshur, posed a political liability to Tyler's aims. <b>As</b> <b>secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>state,</b> Calhoun's political {{objective was to}} see that the presidency was placed {{in the hands of a}} southern extremist, who would put the expansion of slavery at the center of national policy.|$|E

5|$|In 1945, Plymouth-born Michael Foot {{was elected}} Labour MP for the war-torn {{constituency}} of Plymouth Devonport and after serving <b>as</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> for Education and {{responsible for the}} 1974 Health and Safety at Work Act, {{went on to become}} one of the most distinguished leaders of the Labour party.|$|E
5|$|Calhoun had a {{difficult}} relationship with Jackson primarily due to the Nullification Crisis and the Petticoat affair. In contrast with his previous nationalism, Calhoun vigorously supported South Carolina's right to nullify federal tariff legislation he believed unfairly favored the North, putting him into conflict with unionists such as Jackson. In 1832, {{with only a few}} months remaining in his second term, he resigned as vice president and entered the Senate. He sought the Democratic nomination for the presidency in 1844, but lost to surprise nominee James K. Polk, who went on to become president. Calhoun served <b>as</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> under John Tyler from 1844 to 1845. <b>As</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State,</b> he supported the annexation of Texas as a means to extend the slave power, and helped settle the Oregon boundary dispute with Britain. He then returned to the Senate, where he opposed the Mexican–American War, the Wilmot Proviso, and the Compromise of 1850 before his death in 1850. Calhoun often served as a virtual party-independent who variously aligned as needed with Democrats and Whigs.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden {{was awarded}} an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Harvard University in 1851. Later that year, he acted <b>as</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> during the illness of Daniel Webster. In this capacity, {{he wrote a}} {{vigorous}} warning to both Britain and France about interfering in the question of Cuban independence. He also encouraged adherence to the United States' traditional policy of non-interference in Europe during the celebrated visit of Hungarian revolutionary Louis Kossuth to the United States in 1851.|$|E

King William IV knighted Davy and made him a Knight Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order in 1836.|$|E
5|$|It {{was clear}} that Harrison would not be re-nominated unanimously. Many of Harrison's detractors persisted in pushing for an {{incapacitated}} Blaine, though {{he announced that he}} was not a candidate in February 1892. Some party leaders still hoped to draft Blaine into running, and speculation increased when he resigned at the 11th hour <b>as</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> in June. At the convention in Minneapolis, Harrison prevailed on the first ballot, but encountered significant opposition.|$|E
5|$|A {{controversy}} {{arose in}} March 2015, {{when it was}} revealed by the State Department's inspector general that Clinton had exclusively used personal email accounts on a non-government, privately maintained server—instead of email accounts maintained on federal government servers—when conducting official business during her tenure <b>as</b> <b>secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>state.</b> Some experts, officials, members of Congress and political opponents contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures and federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping requirements. The controversy occurred {{against the backdrop of}} Clinton's 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the House Select Committee on Benghazi.|$|E

5|$|A {{month after}} Letcher signed the treaty, Clayton was {{replaced}} <b>as</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> by Daniel Webster. In response to concerns raised {{by one of}} the Americans hoping to construct the line of transit, Webster asked that Letcher attempt to obtain certain modifications to the treaty. Letcher brought these modifications to the Mexican diplomats, but they steadfastly refused to accept them. Letcher, speaking with the blessing of the administration, intimated that the United States would take the region by force if the requested concessions were not made. The Mexican government conceded {{that they would not be}} able to resist such action, but still refused to accept the modifications to the treaty.|$|E
5|$|After narrow {{defeat in}} the general {{election}} of 1964, Douglas-Home resigned the leadership of his party, having instituted a new and less secretive method of electing the party leader. From 1970 to 1974 he served in the cabinet of Edward Heath <b>as</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, an expanded version of the post of Foreign Secretary, which he had held earlier. After the defeat of the Heath government in 1974 he returned to the House of Lords as a life peer and retired from front-line politics.|$|E
5|$|Among Scott's first acts as {{governor}} was appointing Jesse Bledsoe <b>as</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State.</b> Bledsoe delivered Scott's first {{address to the}} legislature on December 13, 1808. Later that winter, Scott was injured when he slipped on the icy steps of the governor's mansion; the injury left him confined to crutches {{for the rest of}} his life and rendered him even more dependent on Bledsoe to perform many of his official functions. His physical condition continued to worsen throughout his term {{as governor}}.|$|E
50|$|In 1782 he was {{appointed}} Prime Minister {{for a second time}} (with Charles James Fox and Lord Shelburne <b>as</b> <b>Secretaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>State)</b> and, upon taking office, pushed for an acknowledgement of the independence <b>of</b> the United <b>States,</b> initiating an end to British involvement in the American War of Independence.|$|R

5|$|An {{opposition}} {{group known}} as the Club emerged led by Sir James Montgomery, previously one of William's chief supporters but angered by Melville being preferred to him <b>as</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State.</b> While the Club included a handful of Jacobites, it largely consisted of Episcopalians and dissident Presbyterians who opposed the Melville/Stair administration, not William himself. In July 1689, William agreed to end Episcopacy since nearly 200 Episcopalian clergy had already been evicted, a policy strongly supported by the Presbyterian majority in Parliament. He continued to resist abolition of the Committee of the Articles before government defeat at the Battle of Killiecrankie led to Parliament being suspended on 2nd August.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> in the Obama {{administration}} from 2009 to 2013, Clinton {{responded to the}} Arab Spring, during which she advocated the U.S. military intervention in Libya. She helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international sanctions regime against Iran, {{in an effort to}} force curtailment of that country's nuclear program; this would eventually lead to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action agreement in 2015. Leaving office after Obama's first term, she wrote her fifth book and undertook speaking engagements.|$|E
5|$|Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey) is {{an ambitious}} Democratic congressman and the House Majority Whip. Underwood helped ensure the {{election}} of President Garrett Walker (Michel Gill), who promised to appoint Underwood <b>as</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State.</b> However, before Walker is sworn in, Chief of Staff Linda Vasquez (Sakina Jaffrey) announces {{that the president will}} not honor the agreement and will instead nominate Senator Michael Kern. Furious at Walker's betrayal, Underwood and his wife Claire (Robin Wright), an environmental activist, make a pact to destroy Kern. When Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara) makes her resources available, she becomes one of their pawns.|$|E

By negotiating the Hay–Pauncefote Treaty with the United Kingdom, the (ultimately unratified) Hay–Herrán Treaty with Colombia, and finally the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty with the newly-independent Republic of Panama, Hay also {{cleared the way for}} the building of the Panama Canal.|$|E
5|$|In 1629, George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, {{arrived in}} Virginia, having {{traveled}} south from Avalon, his failed colony on Newfoundland. Calvert was not welcomed by the Virginians, both because his Catholicism offended them as Protestants, {{and because it}} was no secret that Calvert desired a charter for a portion of the land that the Virginians considered their own. After a brief stay, Calvert returned to England to press for just such a charter, and Claiborne, in his capacity <b>as</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> of Virginia colony, was sent to England to argue the Virginians' case. This happened to be to Claiborne's private advantage, as he was also trying to complete the arrangements for the trading post on Kent Island.|$|E
5|$|In 1754, Pelham died, to be {{succeeded by}} his elder brother, the Duke of Newcastle. Hostility between France and Britain, {{particularly}} over the colonization of North America, continued. Fearing a French invasion of Hanover, George aligned himself with Prussia (ruled by his nephew, Frederick the Great), {{the enemy of}} Austria. Russia and France allied with their former enemy Austria. A French invasion of the British-held island of Minorca led to {{the outbreak of the}} Seven Years' War in 1756. Public disquiet over British failures {{at the start of the}} conflict led to the resignation of Newcastle and the appointment of the Duke of Devonshire as prime minister and William Pitt the Elder <b>as</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> for the Southern Department. In April the following year, George dismissed Pitt, in an attempt to construct an administration more to his liking. Over the succeeding three months attempts to form another stable ministerial combination failed. In June, James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave, held the seals of office for only four days. By the start of July, Pitt was recalled, and the Duke of Newcastle returned as prime minister. <b>As</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State,</b> Pitt guided policy relating to the war. Great Britain, Hanover and Prussia and their allies Hesse-Kassel and Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel were pitted against other European powers, including France, Austria, Russia, Sweden and Saxony. The war involved multiple theatres from Europe to North America and India, where British dominance increased with the victories of Robert Clive over French forces and their allies at the Battle of Arcot and the Battle of Plassey.|$|E
