5|$|After {{reinforcing}} {{the team with}} several expensive players—including Thomas Wernerson and Stig Fredriksson—IFK had {{finished second in the}} league and reached the quarter-finals in the UEFA Cup as 1981 came to an end. 1982 then became a turbulent season <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> board was replaced and the club almost went bankrupt—even needing to borrow money from the official supporter's association to travel to Valencia to play the quarter-final of the UEFA Cup. After the troubled start IFK won every competition they entered, including Allsvenskan, the Allsvenskan play-off, Svenska Cupen, and the UEFA Cup, defeating Hamburger SV 4–0 on aggregate in the finals. During the following 15 years the club was the leading club in Swedish football, winning the Swedish championship ten times, the domestic cup three times and the UEFA Cup twice.|$|E
5|$|By 10:00, {{all three}} French ships were {{within range of}} Centurion and a heavy {{exchange}} of fire began. Within 15 minutes, both Centurion and Marengo had their colours shot away and at 10:45 the ship of the line turned away for open water, followed by the frigates, her rigging in disarray. Damage had rendered Centurion unable to manoeuvre rapidly and she began slowly limping inshore to shelter from Marengo among the coastal shoals. Captain Lind rejoined his ship by boat, hailing the Princess Charlotte, which had still not participated in the battle, to cut her anchor cables and go ashore to avoid being captured. Logan refused and at 11:15 surrendered without a fight <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> French squadron moved back towards the harbour. Marengo again remained beyond the sandbars that marked the entrance. The boatloads of sepoys, who were still en route to Princess Charlotte, turned about and rowed back to shore to avoid capture. Sémillante took possession of the merchant ship while Marengo and Atalante engaged Centurion, which had moved {{out of range of}} support from the shore batteries.|$|E

5|$|In 1856, while Tchaikovsky {{was still}} at the School of Jurisprudence and Anton Rubinstein lobbied aristocrats to form the RMS, critic Vladimir Stasov and an 18-year-old pianist, Mily Balakirev, met and agreed upon a {{nationalist}} agenda for Russian music, one that would take the operas of Mikhail Glinka as a model and incorporate elements from folk music, reject traditional Western practices and use exotic harmonic devices such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> tone and octatonic scales. They saw Western-style conservatories as unnecessary and antipathetic to fostering native talent. Eventually, Balakirev, César Cui, Modest Mussorgsky, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Borodin {{became known as the}} moguchaya kuchka, translated into English as the Mighty Handful or The Five. Rubinstein criticized their emphasis on amateur efforts in musical composition; Balakirev and later Mussorgsky attacked Rubinstein for his musical conservatism and his belief in professional music training. Tchaikovsky and his fellow conservatory students were caught in the middle.|$|E
5|$|Roger died in February 1154 and was {{succeeded by}} William I, who faced {{widespread}} rebellions against his rule in Sicily and Apulia, {{leading to the}} presence of Apulian refugees at the Byzantine court. Conrad's successor, Frederick Barbarossa, launched a campaign against the Normans, but his expedition stalled. These developments encouraged Manuel {{to take advantage of the}} multiple instabilities on the Italian peninsula. He sent Michael Palaiologos and John Doukas Kamateros, both of whom held the high imperial rank of sebastos, with Byzantine troops, ten ships, and large quantities of gold to invade Apulia in 1155.* J. Norwich, Byzantium: The Decline and Fall, 112 The two generals were instructed to enlist the support of Frederick, but he declined because his demoralised army longed to get back north of the Alps as soon as possible. Nevertheless, with the help of disaffected local barons, including Count Robert of Loritello, Manuel's expedition achieved astonishingly rapid progress <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of southern Italy rose up in rebellion against the Sicilian Crown and the untried William I. There followed a string of spectacular successes as numerous strongholds yielded either to force or the lure of gold.|$|E
5|$|The Red Army's winter counter-offensive {{drove the}} Wehrmacht from Moscow, {{but the city}} was still {{considered}} to be threatened, with the front line relatively close. Because of this, the Moscow theater remained a priority for Stalin, who at first {{appeared to be in}} shock due to the initial German success. In particular, the initial Soviet advance was unable to reduce the Rzhev salient, held by several divisions of Army Group Center. Immediately after the Moscow counter-offensive, a series of Soviet attacks (the Battles of Rzhev) were attempted against the salient, each time with heavy losses on both sides. By early 1943, the Wehrmacht had to disengage from the salient <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> front was moving west. Nevertheless, the Moscow front was not finally secured until October 1943, when Army Group Center was decisively repulsed from the Smolensk landbridge and from the left shore of the upper Dnieper {{at the end of the}} Second Battle of Smolensk.|$|E

5|$|While {{working on}} an oil rig, Lenny and Homer accidentally set fire to an ant, who in turn sets fire to all her ant companions, who jump in a puddle of oil to {{extinguish}} the flames. Their brief sighs of relief are replaced with screams <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> rig catches fire. Marge goes with Artie along with Carl to West Springfield to save Homer and Lenny. At first, they are reluctant, as Homer still thinks that Marge and Artie are having an affair, and Lenny feels {{that there is nothing}} for him in Artie's helicopter. However, Artie finally admits defeat to Homer, saying that winning Marge's love was something that he could never accomplish, even with his billions, and Homer jumps on the ladder to the helicopter. Carl reveals that he is in the helicopter, and Lenny also jumps on to be saved, just before the rig collapses. Homer and Marge's marriage is also apparently saved when Artie offers a solution to Homer's snoring problem, a device which converts snoring to music. However, Artie's voice is soon heard through the device's speaker, giving Marge anti-Homer subliminal messages and eventually saying that he is watching her through a camera.|$|E
5|$|Scutes {{from the}} postcranial {{region of the}} {{skeleton}} are also known from struthiosaurines. Cervical bands have been found on S. austriacus, as well as S. sp.. The cervical bands are preserved as a groups {{of two or three}} osteoderms that are fused with a large neural spine on the medial edge, and attached to each other through small ovular scutes with short rounded peaks. The scute attaching to the neural spine has a round ridge with a shallow depression ovular in shape. One band was preserved with a primary osteoderm that was angled across the neck from side-to-side and was as long <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> band itself. The base of the scute is rounded and ends with a tapered point, and the upper side of the scute has a smooth, lightly arching shape. Other bands are preserved with a triangular osteoderms with flat tops and rounded bottoms. The exact placement of cervical bands is not known. In 1995, Pereda-Suberbiola et al. suggested that in a more traditional placement, the bands would have been horizontal along the body, with the neural spine {{in the middle of the}} back. That positioning would mean that the medial scute would be next to another osteoderm of equal size, and together they would either fuse, like in Edmontonia, or touch, as in Sauropelta. Another possibility, suggested by Ford, was that the bands were along the side of the neck, pointing dorsally. If oriented along the side, the primary scutes would have pointed up and down, like in polacanthids, and the medial scutes would, by definition, become secondary osteoderms. The set of medial scutes (or secondary) would be possibly oval in shape.|$|E
