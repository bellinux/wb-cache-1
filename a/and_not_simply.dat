Throughout his childhood and teenage years, Mark's father would have him combine athletic and mental training. Mark would have to dribble a basketball without looking at it while reciting multiplication tables; practice baseball swings in a batting cage while answering questions about the periodic table and similar combined drills that his father hoped would develop quick thinking and self-confidence that would guide Mark {{in all areas of}} life <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> sports.|$|E
5|$|Unlike a legatus legionis (who had {{an officer}} staff of 6 tribuni militum and one praefectus castrorum), an {{auxiliary}} praefectus {{does not appear}} to have enjoyed the support of purely staff officers. The possible exception is an attested beneficiarius ("deputy"), who may have been the praefectus' second-in-command, if this title was a regular rank <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> an ad hoc appointment for a specific task. Also attached to the praefectus were the regiment's vexillarius (standard-bearer for the whole unit) and cornucen (horn-blower).|$|E
5|$|Charitable trusts in English law are {{a form of}} {{express trust}} {{dedicated}} to charitable goals. There {{are a variety of}} advantages to charitable trust status, including exception from most forms of tax and freedom for the trustees not found in other types of English trust. To be a valid charitable trust, the organisation must demonstrate both a charitable purpose and a public benefit. Applicable charitable purposes are normally divided into categories for public benefit including the relief of poverty, the promotion of education, the advancement of health and saving of lives, promotion of religion and all other types of trust recognised by the law. There is also a requirement that the trust's purposes benefit the public (or some section of the public), <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> a group of private individuals.|$|E

5|$|In 2000 Lee {{released}} the 22-minute short Subrosa, following a woman's {{search for her}} mother in Seoul. Intended as a prequel for an undeveloped film entitled Priceless, the film was shot in several formats with a fifteen-person crew, hurriedly recording scenes in public locations. It extensively used character-centred shots, leading to what Lee described as an organic understanding of the character. It also featured on-screen sexual intercourse, framed in a medium shot, which Lee intended as a sign <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> a sex scene. Although Priceless, meant as a sequel to Subrosa, went through more than thirty drafts, it was ultimately cancelled despite interest from Alliance Atlantis and Citytv.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{research}} at the Duke Lemur Center {{has shown that the}} ring-tailed lemur can organize sequences in memory and retrieve ordered sequences without language. The experimental design demonstrated that the lemurs were using internal representation of the sequence to guide their responses <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> following a trained sequence, where one item in the sequence cues the selection of the next. But this is not the limit of the ring-tailed lemur's reasoning skills. Another study, performed at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve, suggests that this species along with several other closely related lemur species understand simple arithmetic operations.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Tenar does not become a wizard (like Ged) or a king (like Arren, the primary {{character}} of The Farthest Shore), Cummins argues that her growth is more revolutionary than either of theirs. In contrast to the male bildungsroman in which characters grow into the characteristics society believes they should have, Tenar's coming of age is a female bildungsroman, in which she must struggle against the patriarchal Kargish empire. She learns to value herself for herself <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> {{for her role as}} a priestess. She is helped through this process by Ged, who sees her as a powerful person, and helps her find choices that she did not see. Over the course of the story she realized that her true power is not her authority as the reincarnated high priestess, but the ability to make the choice to leave the labyrinth and the Tombs. Le Guin suggests that true power is not only about authority and mastery, but trust and collaboration.|$|E

5|$|Hsu {{described}} the localization {{work as a}} balancing act, and said that continuity and consistency was very important. To avoid situations where a small detail in one game is changed in localization, and then comes back as a major point in a sequel, Hsu avoided changing things unless necessary, such as when something in the original would not be understood by the target audience. One thing the localization team had {{to keep in mind}} was keeping the writing in-character: when substituting a Japanese joke with an English one, they had to consider whether it would be something that the character would say, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> that it was funny. They also worked towards having puns and references be appropriate for the dialogue, so that the dialogue still makes sense to players who do not get the reference or pun.|$|E

25|$|To {{ensure the}} safety of blood {{transfusion}} to pediatric patients, hospitals are taking additional precaution to avoid infection and prefer to use specially tested pediatric blood units that are guaranteed negative for Cytomegalovirus.

25|$|Despite the setback, the {{supporters}} of the line {{knew that they were}} close to getting approval. As a result Moorsom was dismissed and Isambard Kingdom Brunel was asked to design a new scheme for the 1846 session. Brunel brought in William Johnson, whom he fully trusted, to survey and redesign the line. This was a full fresh survey <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> a tidying up of Moorsom's work. It was ready within three months and was lodged in Parliament with a new Bill on 30 November 1845.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} {{difficulties}} of sometimes archaic language, caused {{in large part}} by Veblen's struggles with the terminology of unilinear evolution and of biological determination of social variation that still dominated social thought when he began to write, Veblen's work remains relevant, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> for the phrase “conspicuous consumption”. His evolutionary approach to the study of economic systems is once again in vogue and his model of recurring conflict between the existing order and new ways can be of great value in understanding the new global economy.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} present a French naval officer who, at the {{invitation}} of the Mediterranean Zone Board, acted as an observer. An aircraft carrier, HMS Ocean (Captain, later Admiral of the Fleet, Sir Caspar John), cruisers and other warships provided cover. Twenty-two contact mines were discovered and cut from their undersea moorings. The placement of the mines was such that the minefield was deemed to have been deliberately designed <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> a random aggregation of isolated mines. Two of the cut mines were sent to Malta for further examination.|$|E

25|$|Once {{agriculture}} started gaining momentum, around 9000 BC, {{human activity}} {{resulted in the}} selective breeding of cereal grasses (beginning with emmer, einkorn and barley), <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> of those that would favour greater caloric returns through larger seeds. Plants with traits such as small seeds or bitter taste would {{have been seen as}} undesirable. Plants that rapidly shed their seeds on maturity tended not to be gathered at harvest, therefore not stored and not seeded the following season; years of harvesting selected for strains that retained their edible seeds longer.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} the modern prison system was born in London, {{influenced}} by the utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham. Bentham's panopticon introduced the principle of observation and control that underpins {{the design of the}} modern prison. The notion of prisoners being incarcerated as part of their punishment <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> as a holding state until trial or hanging, was at the time revolutionary. His views influenced the establishment of the first prisons used as criminal rehabilitation centers. At a time when the implementation of capital punishment for a variety of relatively trivial offences was on the decline, the notion of incarceration as a form of punishment and correction held great appeal to reform-minded thinkers and politicians.|$|E
25|$|Further {{interwoven}} {{into the}} plays of Plautus {{and just as}} common {{as the use of}} proverbs is the use of Greek within the texts of the plays. J. N. Hough suggests that Plautus's use of Greek is for artistic purposes <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> because a Latin phrase will not fit the meter. Greek words are used when describing foods, oils, perfumes, etc. This is similar to the use of French terms in the English language such as garçon or rendezvous. These words give the language a French flair just as Greek did to the Latin-speaking Romans. Slaves or characters of low standing speak much of the Greek. One possible explanation for this is that many Roman slaves were foreigners of Greek origin.|$|E
