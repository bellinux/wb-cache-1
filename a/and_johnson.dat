5|$|Some {{research}} suggests that G-spot and clitoral orgasms are of the same origin. Masters <b>and</b> <b>Johnson</b> {{were the first to}} determine that the clitoral structures surround and extend along and within the labia. Upon studying women's sexual response cycle to different stimulation, they observed that both clitoral and vaginal orgasms had the same stages of physical response, and found that the majority of their subjects could only achieve clitoral orgasms, while a minority achieved vaginal orgasms. On this basis, Masters <b>and</b> <b>Johnson</b> argued that clitoral stimulation is the source of both kinds of orgasms, reasoning that the clitoris is stimulated during penetration by friction against its hood.|$|E

5|$|After their arrest, law {{enforcement}} officials investigated whether Adolf, Gartrell <b>and</b> <b>Johnson</b> were linked to vandalism shootings that targeted at least two federal buildings in Denver two weeks prior to their arrest. Windows were shot at the U.S. Custom House and the U.S. Military Entrance Processing Station in Denver's downtown Federal District.

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{his junior}} college career, two {{universities}} offered Johnson scholarships: Azusa Pacific University and Pepperdine University. Johnson chose the latter, and in his only year in college, he averaged 15.7 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game, and developed a reputation for tough defense. After that year, Johnson made himself eligible for the 1976 NBA draft, but was skeptical that any team would take him. NBA teams were wary of drafting a player with character issues, <b>and</b> <b>Johnson</b> was known to be a troublemaker.|$|E

5|$|Congressional {{interest}} and public pressure for greater air pollution regulation had existed since {{the signing of}} the 1963 Clean Air Act, the first federal legislation on the issue, but further action had been opposed by members of Congress who believed responsibility for air regulation properly lay with the states, not the federal government. Partly in response to the added public pressure spurred by the smog event, Congress passed <b>and</b> <b>Johnson</b> signed the 1967 Air Quality Act, which amended the 1963 Clean Air Act to provide for study of air quality and control methods.|$|E

5|$|Hancock's {{time in the}} West was brief. President Johnson, {{unhappy with}} the way Republican generals were {{governing}} the South under Reconstruction, sought replacements for them.
