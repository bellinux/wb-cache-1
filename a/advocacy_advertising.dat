5000|$|The term {{lobbying}} {{in everyday}} parlance can describe {{a wide variety}} of activities, and in its general sense, suggests <b>advocacy,</b> <b>advertising,</b> or promoting a cause.

5000|$|Handwaving is {{frequently}} used in low-quality debate, including political campaigning and commentary, issue-based <b>advocacy,</b> <b>advertising</b> and public relations, tabloid journalism, opinion pieces, Internet memes, and informal discussion and writing. If the opponent {{in a debate}} or commentator on an argument alleges hand-waving, it suggests the proponent of the argument, position or message has engaged {{in one or more}} fallacies of logic, usually informal, and/or glossed over non-trivial details, and is attempting to [...] challenges and deflect questions, as if swatting at flies. The distraction inherent {{in the sense of the}} term has become a key part of the meaning. The fallacies in question vary, but often include one of the many variants of argument to emotion, and in political discourse frequently involve unjustified assignment or transference of blame. Hand-waving is not itself a fallacy; the proponent's argument may incidentally be correct despite their failure to properly support it. [...] A tertiary meaning refers to use of poorly-reasoned arguments specifically to impress or persuade.|$|E
40|$|The P. A. Genome Project is a new, {{long term}} {{endeavor}} with two major objectives: (1) To develop a grand analogy with the Human Genome such that {{our understanding of}} public administration can be expanded. (2) To “map ” the P. A. Genome, just like the Human Genome has been mapped, to understand more fully the breadth and variety of public administration topics and behaviors. The analogy process starts with chromosomes. Each cell {{in the human body}} contains 23 pairs (male/female) of these. In the case of the P. A. Genome, we have taken 23 aspects of the public/private interface. An example would be the “chromosome ” for “health and nutrition“, which would include, illustratively, government Medicaid support for care in private nursing facilities. Spread over the 23 pairs of chromosomes in each cell in the human body are 30, 000 to 80, 000 genes. The P. A. Genome equivalents to human genes, in our analogy, are various attributes and/or actions contained in plans/policies/programs/projects (the “cells”) of various agencies (the “bodies”). A list of such attributes/actions might include: Absenteeism Accounting <b>Advertising</b> <b>Advocacy</b> Allocation Affirmative Action Etc...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt} Direction {{and control}} are needed {{whenever}} people {{come together to}} realize societal and organizational goals. To govern is to do just that, to direct and control, by established laws or—preferably not—by arbitrary will. Its core underlying practices, where the former mode is used, are to specify expectations, delegate authority, and substantiate performance. Complex systems cannot be reduced; however, where society or an organization is multipart or too large for simple management, it usually moves {{for the creation of}} entities tasked with guiding related processes and systems in their host’s co-evolving context of society, economy, environment, polity, and technology. It follows that governance, the activity of governing, is a multifaceted phenomenon; definitions of it can be subtle, challenging, and powerful at once. With frequent overlap and resultant conflict, governance shapes affairs at global, national (including, for instance, state or provincial, municipal, and local), institutional, and community levels by means of the entities that occupy shifting (and frequently permeable) social and economic space there, such as government (including the military), civil society (including the voluntary or not-for-profit sector), and the private sector. (Public and private media play <b>advocacy,</b> entertainment, and <b>advertising</b> roles throughout.) All the same, most definitions of governance rest on three dimensions: (i) authority, (ii) decision making, and (iii) accountability for conformance (assurance) and performance (value creation and resource utilization). Hence, regimes of governance determine severally who has authority, who makes decisions (and how other stakeholders make their voice heard), {{and the manner in which}} account is rendered...|$|R

40|$|The {{benefits}} to a corporate sponsor of {{two types of}} philanthropic activities [...] cause promotions and <b>advocacy</b> <b>advertising</b> [...] are examined. Results from four laboratory studies indicate that perceptions of corporate sponsorship responsibility (CSR) are affected by consumers’ elaboration levels. Consumer perceptions of CSR are more favorable for cause promotions, which do not receive much elaboration, than they are for <b>advocacy</b> <b>advertising,</b> which prompts more elaboration. In addition, perceived congruence between the sponsor and the social issue is shown to moderate these effects: higher congruence between the sponsor and social issue increases favorable ratings of CSR for cause promotions, but only if elaboration on the sponsorship activity is facilitated. On the other hand, lower congruence increases favorable ratings of CSR for <b>advocacy</b> <b>advertising</b> as long as elaboration on the sponsorship is not constrained. We also find that higher congruence enhances CSR ratings if participants are primed to focus their attention on the sponsor brand, while lower congruence enhances CSR if participants are primed to focus their attention on the social issue. ...|$|E

Besides this, consumers were found to place less importance on the advertiser's expertise. Moreover, the advertiser and consumer's involvement in the issues they championed only passively influenced consumers' perceptions. We urge future researchers to explore and expand the scales discussed, as well as consider whether they will create a similar impact on commercial and non-commercial messages.

40|$|Advocacy {{journalism is}} practised {{by a wide}} range of {{mainstream}} media publishers and broadcasters and alternative media outlets. It is a genre of journalism that is fact-based but supports a specific viewpoint on an issue. It is generally in opposition to so-called objective journalism. Likewise, <b>advocacy</b> <b>advertising</b> is used to espouse a point of view about controversial public issues. It can be used to target consumer groups, government agencies, special groups or market competitors. Independent student journalism publishing also often challenges normative values. <b>Advocacy</b> <b>advertising,</b> or social issues marketing, was the brief for five shortlisted groups of Auckland University of Technology advertising creativity students on behalf of a New Zealand lobby and protest movement called Homeowners Against Line Trespassers (HALT) in September 2006. HALT was campaigning against a controversial proposal by the state-owned enterprise Transpower to build a 400 kV transmission line across a 200 km route from Otahuhu to Whakamaru in the Waikato as part of a new national pylons network. Three campaign advertisements were created by a pair of students for AUT’s journalism training newspaper, Te Waha Nui, and a separate single advertisement was designed by a second pair of students for an Auckland metropolitan billboard and postcard campaign. This article examines advocacy media {{in the context of the}} HALT campaign that explored research links between power pylons and public health and the dynamic with student editors that led to non-publication of the professionally selected social issues message...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The health {{medical costs}} of {{colorectal}} cancer are increasingly higher in Taiwan. The National Health Insurance Administration (NHI) and The Health Promotion Administration of the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) in Taiwan encourage individuals {{to adopt an}} earnest approach to healthy behavior through <b>advocacy</b> <b>advertising.</b> However, the number of colorectal cancer patients continues to increase annually. Our study explored the effects of health-related advertisements (ads) on healthy behavior intentions as influenced by regulatory focus theory (RFT) and construal level theory (CLT). We conducted an experiment with different public health advocacy ads. A 2 (regulatory focus: promotion vs. prevention) × 2 (temporal distance: one month vs. one year) × 2 (graphics-text ratio: more pictures and less text vs. fewer pictures and more text) three-factor experiment was adopted. The multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) results revealed that ads with higher construal levels (i. e., more text) had greater effects with a promotion-oriented regulatory focus. However, {{no significant differences were}} found in either attitude toward the ads or behavior intention when the regulatory focus was prevention. In addition, according to the young testers and those who were psychologically distant from colorecta...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{assesses the}} relative impact on legislative decision making of several prevalent types of corporate political activities: {{political action committee}} (PAC) contributions, constituency building, executive lobbying, use of professional lob-byists, and <b>advocacy</b> <b>advertising.</b> Two separate groups of expert informants pro-vided data on both the usage {{and the effectiveness of}} these different influence tac-tics. The results indicate convergent support for constituency-centered models of legislative decision making that are based on public choice theory. Further re-search is suggested to explore how, when, and why firms implement different mixes of these activities and what determines the effectiveness of the overall po-litical strategies that result. During the past two decades, corporations have become increasingly active in the political arena. In particular, more companies are devoting greater resources to a wider array of legislative influence activities than previously, whether through various kinds of direct and indirect lobbying activities or in the form of campaign contributions (Armey, 1996; Center for Responsive Politics, 1998; Kuntz, 1995). By actively attempting to shape public policy, many companies and industries are seeking to reduce uncertainty, to mitigate or eliminate perceived threats, and to create opportunities in their environments. Recent congressional debates about the future of specific sectors of the economy (e. g., health care, telecom-munications, financial services, utilities), as well as ongoing polic...|$|E
40|$|This paper takes a {{qualitative}} look at corporate interests [...] -and influence [...] -of the mainstream media. It studies management/labor viewpoints {{and their respective}} play in the news sheets. And it calls on academics and journalists {{to shed light on}} the issue, through literature and interviews. The conversations explore many camouflaged aspects of news production, such as newsroom policy, editor manipulation, reporter self-censorship, personal perspectives, and practical limitations. They touch on trends, budgets, newspaper goals, monopolies, advertisers, readers, journalists, and asks for opinions on what system [...] -past, present or imagined [...] -represents the ideal. No pretences are made to disguise the respondent group as a random, representative sample, for it is not. This project provides anecdotal information from a behind-the-scenes perspective. The first chapter comprises a literature review; the second probes management-labor media coverage; the third focuses on <b>advocacy</b> <b>advertising,</b> using recent anti-Bill 40 (Ontario labor-law reform) ads as a case study, and dissects the issue through interviews with journalists; the fourth asks journalists for their thoughts on possible corporate influence in general. And the final chapter comprises conclusions and suggestions for improving our mass media system in order to promote democracy. Source: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 39 - 02, page: 0310.

40|$|Public service {{advertisements}} {{have been}} used by many in hopes of "selling" good health behaviors. But selling good behavior [...] even if it could be done more effectively [...] is not the best goal for using mass media to prevent health problems. Personal behavior is only part of what determines health status. Social conditions and the physical environment are important determinants of health that are usually ignored by health promotion advertising. Public service advertising may be doing more harm than good if it is diverting attention from more effective socially based health promotion strategies. Counter-ads are one communications strategy {{that could be used to}} promote a broader responsibility for rectifying health problems. In the tradition of <b>advocacy</b> <b>advertising</b> directly promoting policy rather than products, counter-ads promote views consistent with a public health perspective. Counter-ads set the agenda for health issues, conferring status on policy-oriented strategies for addressing health problems. The primary purpose of counter-ads is to challenge the dominant view that public health problems reflect personal health habits. They are controversial because they place health issues in a social and political context. Advertising strategies for health promotion range over a spectrum from individually oriented public service advertising to socially oriented counter-advertising. The recent anti-tobacco campaign from the California Department of Health Services represents advertisements across the spectrum. Counter-ads that focus on a politically controversial definition for health problems are an appropriate and necessary alternative to public service advertising...|$|E

40|$|This Article {{was written}} for a 2007 Symposium on media reform {{entitled}} Reclaiming the First Amendment at Hofstra Law School. My approach to media reform focuses on ways to strengthen journalistic standards and professionalism against commercial pressures; to keep government out of journalistic autonomy and editorial decisions in a direct fashion while providing incentives for certain kinds of journalism; to enhance the availability of diverse discourses across all media; and to seek ways to empower the audience. The Article proposes a two-pronged, multi-factor approach to electronic media reform {{in the hope of}} promoting the electronic press 2 ̆ 7 s roles as educator and watchdog. The first prong is directed to the information market as a whole and concerns itself with ways of promoting media pluralism. The notion behind this aspect is to create an overall balance in which mainstream commercial media, non-profit public media, and alternative media can flourish and enrich one another and compensate for one another 2 ̆ 7 s weaknesses. The second prong of the reform proposal is internal to the context ofbroadcasting. The Article suggests experimenting with the following: structural regulations designed to promote journalistic values; a requirement that broadcasters spend a certain percentage of their gross advertising revenues on news and public affairs production and programming; different options for constructing a requirement that broadcasters devote a percentage of their advertising time to <b>advocacy</b> <b>advertising,</b> for which they would be allowed to be paid a premium over their ordinary commercial rates; and audience empowerment, including disclosure-oriented requirements designed to foster audience activism and strategies to engage an audience whose attention is claimed by an unprecedented abundance of content...|$|E
