The same two companies negotiated a six-year, $6million contract to broadcast the Series on television in 1950. Again, Chandler directed the proceeds into the pension fund.|$|E

5|$|As a cardinal, Paul had {{previously}} maintained neutrality between {{the great powers}} of Spain and France that had dominated the previous conclave and {{were present in the}} current one as well. While he had been the papal envoy to Spain and was receiving <b>a</b> <b>pension</b> from them, he was largely low profile as a cardinal and perceived as neutral. At 52, Paul was young {{at the time of his}} election, and was anticipated to have a lengthy papacy, not requiring a third conclave soon.|$|E
5|$|As {{one of the}} few routes into hilly central Westchester, {{the river}} and its {{associated}} roads saw frequent skirmishes. In November 1777, three young men with Patriot sympathies were walking near the river crossing on the Dobbs Ferry Road (now Ashford Avenue) when they came upon a group of horsemen affiliated with Kipp's Regiment, one of the county's most-feared Loyalist militias. The young men taunted their rivals, who beat them so severely that two later died. The survivor was awarded <b>a</b> <b>pension,</b> {{believed to be the first}} in U.S. history, by the Continental Congress.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{her years}} of service, {{she had never}} {{received}} a regular salary and was for years denied compensation. Her unofficial status and the unequal payments offered to black soldiers caused great difficulty in documenting her service, and the U.S. government was slow in recognizing its debt to her. Tubman did not receive <b>a</b> <b>pension</b> for her service in the Civil War until 1899. Her constant humanitarian work for her family and former slaves, meanwhile, kept her {{in a state of}} constant poverty, and her difficulties in obtaining a government pension were especially taxing for her.|$|E

A second change is the creation of a National Employment Savings Trust, <b>a</b> public <b>pension</b> provider {{for those who do not}} have <b>an</b> occupational <b>pensions,</b> which will function as <b>a</b> low-fee <b>pension</b> scheme in competition with existing funds.|$|R
5|$|On 3May 1816, Louis XVIII granted him {{the title}} of Baron with the Commander's Cross of the Order of Saint Louis, which {{entitled}} him to wear a red sash (right shoulder to left hip); he automatically received <b>a</b> <b>pension,</b> and hereditary nobility was granted to the son and grandson of knights.

5|$|Princess Victoria grew to hate Conroy, {{thanks to}} the oppressive system, {{and he was also}} unpopular among the rest of the British royal family.

Conroy was immediately expelled from Victoria's household, though he remained in the Duchess of Kent's service for several more years. Given <b>a</b> <b>pension</b> and a baronetcy, Conroy retired to his estate near Reading, Berkshire, in 1842 and died heavily in debt twelve years later.|$|E

5|$|The {{share of}} public {{spending}} in GDP increased from 27% in 1995 to 30% in 2000.

To quell social unrest, provincial governors padded their payrolls. The government had embarked on <b>a</b> <b>pension</b> reform with costs reaching 3% of GDP in 2000, as it still had to pay pensioners but no longer received contributions.|$|E
5|$|After Johnson's {{death in}} 1774, Brant and her {{children}} left Johnson Hall in Johnstown, New York {{and returned to her}} native village of Canajoharie, further west on the Mohawk River. A Loyalist during the American Revolutionary War, she migrated to British Canada, where she served as an intermediary between British officials and the Iroquois. After the war, she settled in what is now Kingston, Ontario. In recognition of her service to the Crown, the British government gave Brant <b>a</b> <b>pension</b> and compensated her for her wartime losses, including a grant of land. When the British ceded their former colonial territory to the United States, most of the Iroquois nations were forced out of New York. A Six Nations Reserve was established in what is now Ontario.|$|E

Simulation {{results show that the}} switch from the basic pension to the guaranteed pension does not always generate favorable results. If we consider <b>a</b> public <b>pension</b> program with the same scale as the current Japanese program, the highest level of social welfare is attained when <b>a</b> public <b>pension</b> system consists of only <b>a</b> basic <b>pension</b> and is financed by a consumption tax.

5|$|Despite refusing {{appointment}} to the High Court of Justice in 1928, he was offered the position again in 1941 and accepted, joining the King's Bench Division. In 1945 he served as the alternate British judge at the Nuremberg trials, and he was made a Privy Counsellor in 1947. He joined the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in 1950 but retired in 1956 when he had served for long enough to draw <b>a</b> <b>pension.</b> From 1958 {{he served in the}} House of Lords, and his speech against a private bill in 1962 saw it defeated by 70 votes to 36, two days before he died on 10 February 1962.|$|E
5|$|Each {{successive}} rank {{gave its}} holder greater pensions and legal privileges. The highest rank, of full marquess, {{came with a}} state pension and a territorial fiefdom. Holders of the rank immediately below, that of ordinary marquess, received <b>a</b> <b>pension,</b> but had no territorial rule. Officials who served in government belonged to the wider commoner social class and were ranked just below nobles in social prestige. The highest government officials could be enfeoffed as marquesses. By the Eastern Han period, local elites of unattached scholars, teachers, students, and government officials began to identify themselves {{as members of a}} larger, nationwide gentry class with shared values and a commitment to mainstream scholarship. When the government became noticeably corrupt in mid-to-late Eastern Han, many gentrymen even considered the cultivation of morally grounded personal relationships more important than serving in public office.|$|E
5|$|Following her husband's {{death in}} 1461, Catherine's role receded {{to that of}} queen dowager at the court of her stepson, King Stephen Tomašević. Two years later, forces of the Ottoman Empire led by Mehmed the Conqueror invaded Bosnia {{and put an end}} to the {{independent}} kingdom. Catherine's stepson was executed, while Sigismund and Catherine, her son and daughter by Thomas, were captured and taken to Constantinople, where they converted to Islam. Queen Catherine escaped, taking refuge in Dubrovnik and eventually settling in Rome, where she received <b>a</b> <b>pension</b> from the papacy. From Rome she strove to be reunited with her children. Her efforts to negotiate and offer a ransom proved futile. She died a Franciscan tertiary in Rome, having named the papacy guardians of Bosnia and her children heirs to the throne, should they ever return to Christianity.|$|E

5|$|From September 1513 to 1516, under Pope Leo X, Leonardo {{spent much}} of his time living in the Belvedere in the Vatican in Rome, where Raphael and Michelangelo were both active at the time. In October 1515, King Francis I of France recaptured Milan. On 19 December, Leonardo was present at the meeting of Francis I and Pope Leo X, which took place in Bologna. Leonardo was {{commissioned}} to make for Francis a mechanical lion that could walk forward then open its chest to reveal a cluster of lilies. In 1516, he entered Francis' service, being given the use of the manor house Clos Lucé, now a public museum, near the king's residence at the royal Château d'Amboise. He spent the last three years of his life here, accompanied by his friend and apprentice, Count Francesco Melzi, and supported by <b>a</b> <b>pension</b> totalling 10,000scudi.|$|E
5|$|Han society {{below the}} level of kings was divided into twenty ranks, which awarded certain {{privileges}} such as exemption from certain laws, the nineteenth being a marquess and the twentieth being a full marquess—the difference being the former was only given <b>a</b> <b>pension</b> while the latter was given a marquessate (houguo 侯國)—typically the size of a county. If the kings' sons were grandsons of the emperor, they were made full marquesses; if not, they were considered commoners. However, this rule was changed in 127 BC so that all the kings' sons were made full marquesses. It is unknown whether early Western-Han marquessates enjoyed the same level of autonomy as early Western-Han kingdoms; by 145 BC, all marquessates' staff were appointed by the central government. The marquess had no administrative role over his marquessate; he merely collected a portion of the tax revenues. His Chancellor was the equivalent of a county Prefect.|$|E
5|$|He was accepted, and {{although}} his appointment delighted Murray, {{the government was}} very concerned {{at the loss of}} a good Attorney General. In an attempt to persuade him to stay, the new Prime Minister, the Duke of Newcastle offered him the Duchy of Lancaster, in addition to the position of Attorney General, an extra £6,000 a year, and <b>a</b> <b>pension,</b> and finally attempted to blackmail him by saying that if he accepted the office of Lord Chief Justice, the government would refuse to grant him a peerage. It was customary for all Lord Chief Justices to be given a peerage, and Murray responded by saying that in that situation he would refuse to become either Lord Chief Justice or Attorney General. Newcastle gave in, and promised to allow him to become Lord Chief Justice and to recommend him for a peerage.|$|E
