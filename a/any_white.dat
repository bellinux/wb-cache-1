5|$|Following the well-received Get Behind Me Satan, Icky Thump {{marked a}} return to the punk, garage rock and blues {{influences}} for which the band is known. It was recorded at Nashville's Blackbird Studio and took almost three weeks to record—the longest of <b>any</b> <b>White</b> Stripes album. It would also be their first album with a title track. The album's release came {{on the heels of a}} series of concerts in Europe and one in North America at Bonnaroo.|$|E
5|$|Pulos and Hutt {{knew that}} if the allele that created a white coat was recessive, then white horses {{would have to be}} {{homozygous}} for the condition and therefore breeding white horses together would always result in a white foal. However, this did not occur in their study and they concluded that white was not recessive. Conversely, if a white coat was a simple autosomal dominant, ww horses would be non-white, while both Ww and WW horses would be white, and the latter would always produce white offspring. But Pulos and Hutt did not observe <b>any</b> <b>white</b> horses that always produced white offspring, suggesting that homozygous dominant (WW) white horses did not exist. As a result, Pulos and Hutt concluded that white was semidominant and lethal in the homozygous state: ww horses were non-white, Ww were white, and WW died.|$|E
5|$|The flight on long pointed wings is noiseless, due {{to their}} soft plumage, and very buoyant. Flying birds can be sexed since the male has a white wing patch across three primary {{feathers}} and white tips to the two outer tail feathers, whereas females do not show <b>any</b> <b>white</b> in flight. Chicks have downy brown and buff plumage, and the fledged young are similar in appearance to the adult female. Adults moult their body feathers from June onwards after breeding, suspend the process while migrating, and replace the tail and flight feathers on the wintering grounds. Moult is completed between January and March. Immature birds follow a similar moult strategy to the adults unless they are from late broods, {{in which case the}} entire moult may take place in Africa.|$|E
50|$|The {{expression}} was in {{use during the}} 19th century, much like the female equivalent, Miss Ann. Miss Ann was an expression used among slaves {{to refer to the}} woman of the house, usually the wife of the slave owner, and <b>any</b> other <b>white</b> woman that the slaves had to serve. Mister Charlie was the slave owner, or <b>any</b> other <b>white</b> man exploiting, or being condescending towards, slaves.|$|R
50|$|White {{markings}} on Fjord horses are rare, {{they have been}} noted as long as written records have been kept of the breed. A small star is acceptable, but <b>any</b> other <b>white</b> or pink markings are considered undesirable. The Norges Fjordhestlag (The Norwegian Fjord Horse Association) decided in 1982 that stallions of any age with <b>any</b> other <b>white</b> markings than a small white star cannot be accepted for breeding.|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} pie in {{the legend}} included sand eels, horse mackerel, pilchards, herring, dogfish and ling along with a seventh fish. In a traditional pie, the primary ingredient is the pilchard (sardine), although mackerel or herring {{is used as a}} substitute. Richard Stevenson, chef at The Ship Inn in Mousehole, suggests that <b>any</b> <b>white</b> fish will work for the filling, with pilchards or herring just added for the presentation. Prior to putting it in the pie the fish should be skinned and boned (except the head and tail) {{to make it easier to}} eat. Along with the fish, the other traditional ingredients are thickened milk, eggs and boiled potatoes.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Salisbury in January 1980, Mugabe {{was greeted}} by a {{supportive}} crowd. He settled into a house in Mount Pleasant, a wealthy white-dominated suburb. Machel had cautioned Mugabe not to alienate Rhodesia's white minority, warning him that <b>any</b> <b>white</b> flight after the election would cause economic damage {{as it had in}} Mozambique. Accordingly, during his electoral campaign Mugabe avoided the use of Marxist and revolutionary rhetoric. Mugabe insisted that in the election, ZANU would stand as a separate party to ZAPU, and refused Nkomo's request for a meeting. He formed ZANU into a political party, known as Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF). Predictions were made that ZANU-PF would win the election {{on the basis of the}} country's ethnic divisions; Mugabe was Shona, a community that made up around 70% of the country's population, while Nkomo was Ndebele, a tribal group who made up only around 20%. For many in the white community and in the British government, this outcome was a terrifying prospect due to Mugabe's avowed Marxist beliefs and the inflammatory comments that he had made about whites during the guerrilla war.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1962, the Archdiocese of New Orleans {{announced}} its plan to desegregate the New Orleans parochial school system for the 1962–1963 school year. Perez led a movement to pressure businesses into firing <b>any</b> <b>whites</b> who allowed their children to attend the newly desegregated Catholic schools. Catholics in St. Bernard Parish boycotted one school, which the Archdiocese kept open without students for four months; it was burned down in what was suspected as arson. In response, Archbishop Joseph Rummel excommunicated Perez and two other opponents of integration on April 16, 1962.|$|R

McClanahan's youngest child, Daniel, was left with his Nooksack wife Nina (sister of Chief Seclamatum or Indian Jim). Nina died of pulmonary tuberculosis soon after, however, and Daniel joined his siblings with the Judsons. It would be two years before <b>any</b> <b>White</b> woman other than Judson came to the area.|$|E

2500|$|In response, Governor Monroe {{called out}} the militia; the slave patrols soon {{captured}} some slaves accused of involvement. Sidbury says some trials {{had a few}} measures to prevent abuses, such as an appointed attorney, but they were [...] "hardly 'fair'". Slave codes prevented slaves from being treated like whites, and they were given quick trials without a jury. Monroe influenced the Executive Council to pardon and sell some slaves instead of hanging them. Historians say the Virginia courts executed between 26 and 35 slaves. None of the executed slaves had killed <b>any</b> <b>whites</b> because the uprising had been foiled before it began.|$|R

The coat comes in black or liver (dark brown) with white markings or predominantly white with black or liver markings; Tricolour: black and white or liver and white with tan markings, usually found on eyebrows, cheeks, inside of ears and under the tail. <b>Any</b> <b>white</b> portion of the coat may be flecked with ticking.|$|E
25|$|The Baez family {{converted}} to Quakerism during Joan's early childhood, {{and she has}} continued {{to identify with the}} tradition, particularly in her commitment to pacifism and social issues. While growing up, Baez was subjected to racial slurs and discrimination due to her Mexican heritage. Consequently, she became involved with a variety of social causes early in her career. She declined to play in <b>any</b> <b>white</b> student venues that were segregated, which meant that when she toured the Southern states she would play only at black colleges.|$|E
25|$|The {{primitive}} southern Negro, as he sang, {{was sure}} to bear down on the third and seventh tone of the scale, slurring between major and minor. Whether in the cotton field of the Delta or on the Levee up St. Louis way, {{it was always the}} same. Till then, however, I had never heard this slur used by a more sophisticated Negro, or by <b>any</b> <b>white</b> man. I tried to convey this effect... by introducing flat thirds and sevenths (now called blue notes) into my song, although its prevailing key was major..., and I carried this device into my melody as well... This was a distinct departure, but as it turned out, it touched the spot.|$|E
50|$|When {{bleaching}} is {{abused and}} an individual develops an unhealthy obsession with whitening, the term bleachorexia or whitening junky has been used. The condition {{is characterized by}} repeated bleaching even though the teeth are already white and will not get <b>any</b> <b>whiter.</b> This condition is somewhat similar to body dismorphic disorder. The individual perceives their teeth never to be white enough, despite repeated bleaching. A person with bleachorexia will typically continually request more bleaching services or products from the dental professional. It has been recommended that a target shade be agreed before starting bleaching treatment to help with this problem.|$|R

5000|$|Many {{of those}} fleeing north from the American Revolution in the Thirteen Colonies were Black Loyalists, and the charter {{specifically}} excluded blacks and <b>any</b> <b>whites</b> {{who were not}} Loyalists or descendants of Loyalists, from practising a trade, selling goods, fishing in the harbour, or becoming freemen with a right to vote; these provisions stood until 1870. In consequence, the town of Portland grew up north of the boundary of Saint John, around Fort Howe, where anyone could live and work freely. Portland was later amalgamated with the City of Saint John and is now {{thought of as the}} [...] "north end." ...|$|R
25|$|Following {{the return}} passage of Lewis and Clark in 1806, {{there is no}} record of <b>any</b> <b>white</b> person visiting the site of the city of Great Falls until {{explorer}} and trapper Jim Bridger reached the area in 1822. Bridger and Major Andrew Henry led a fur-trading expedition to the future city location in April 1823 (and were attacked by Blackfeet Indians while camping at the site). British explorer Alexander Ross trapped around Great Falls in 1824. In 1838, a mapping expedition sent by the U.S. federal government and guided by Bridger spent four years in the area. Margaret Harkness Woodman became the first white woman to visit the Great Falls area in 1862.|$|E
25|$|To {{remove any}} odor and {{excessive}} {{fat in the}} dish, <b>any</b> <b>white</b> fat adhering to the intestines should be meticulously cleaned out by rubbing them with wheat flour and salt and washing them several times. Since cooking the dish requires not only specialized cooking techniques {{and a great deal}} of labor to prepare, but also very fresh ingredients, gopchang jeongol is generally eaten at restaurants specializing in tripe dishes. The dish, which is seasoned with a hot and spicy red chili-based sauce, is served as a main entrée, accompanied with a bowl of steamed rice. It is often shared between several diners on the center of the table, and is also a popular anju when drinking alcoholic beverages such as soju in South Korea.|$|E
25|$|The {{transition}} to red grape varieties was slow. Plantings of Cabernet Franc in the Pomerol area were recorded, under the names Vidure and Bidure, {{as early as}} the 16th century but Merlot {{does not appear to have}} been introduced to the area until a couple of hundred years later. In 1760, Louis-Léonard Fontémong, a Libournais négociant, planted what appears to be the first documented instance of Merlot in the region, in a vineyard that is now part of Château Rouget. However, white wine grapes continued to dominate the vineyards of Pomerol until the late 19th century when the higher prices of red clarets and the waning Dutch influence made red wine production more enticing. When the region received its full AOC status in 1936, the AOC regulation specifically outlawed the plantings of <b>any</b> <b>white</b> grape varieties in Pomerol.|$|E

25|$|Pierre-Yves Gayraud, the film's costume designer, spent fifteen weeks researching 18th century fashion. Production of over 1,400 costumes, in {{addition}} to the preparation of shoes, hats and other accessories were completed within three months by workshops in and around Bucharest in Romania. The costume department had to make the clothing look worn and dirty. Additionally, the actors were required to wear the costumes and more or less live in them prior to shooting. The character Grenouille was not given <b>any</b> <b>white</b> clothing and wore bluish over-garments throughout most of the film because the filmmakers wanted to depict him as a shadow and a chameleon. Instead of dressing the character of Laura in the colorful regional dress that was the tradition of the time, she was dressed in the less vivid tones of a Parisian damsel to highlight her social aspirations as well as her red hair.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{producers}} behind the Super Tuscan movement were originally Chianti producers who were rebelling against what they felt were antiquated DOC regulations. Some of these producers wanted to make Chiantis that were 100% varietal Sangiovese. Others wanted the flexibility to experiment with blending French grape varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot or to {{not be required to}} blend in <b>any</b> <b>white</b> grape varieties. The late 20th century saw a flurry of creativity and innovation in the Chianti zones as producers experimented with new grape varieties and introduced modern wine-making techniques {{such as the use of}} new oak barrels. The prices and wine ratings of some Super Tuscans would regularly eclipse those of DOC sanctioned Chiantis. The success of the Super Tuscans encouraged government officials to reconsider the DOC regulations in order to bring some of these wines back into the fold labelled as Chianti.|$|E
