5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Zappa met Ray Collins. Collins {{supported}} himself by {{working as a}} carpenter, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>weekends</b> sang with {{a group called the}} Soul Giants. Collins got into a fight with their guitar player, who quit, leaving the band in need of a substitute, and Zappa filled in. The Soul Giants' repertoire originally consisted of R covers; though after Zappa joined the band he encouraged them to play his own original material and try to get a record contract. While most of the band members liked the idea, then-leader and saxophone player Davy Coronado felt that performing original material would cost them bookings, and quit the band. The Soul Giants became the Mothers and Zappa took over leadership of the band.|$|E
