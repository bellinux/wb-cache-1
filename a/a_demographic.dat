5|$|In {{common with}} many other {{developed}} countries, Canada is experiencing <b>a</b> <b>demographic</b> shift towards an older population, with more retirees and fewer people of working age. In 2006, the average age was 39.5 years; by 2011, it had risen to approximately 39.9 years.|$|E
5|$|A One Day International (ODI) is an {{international}} cricket match between two representative teams, each having ODI status, {{as determined by the}} International Cricket Council (ICC). An ODI differs from Test matches in that the number of overs per team is limited, and that each team has only one innings. , 37 players have represented the Hong Kong national team in ODIs, since its debut in 2004. Many of these players are of South Asian origin, <b>a</b> <b>demographic</b> which comprises {{only a small fraction of}} the overall population of Hong Kong.|$|E
5|$|Home to {{a diverse}} set of communities, the Bay Area has <b>a</b> <b>demographic</b> {{distribution}} that varies greatly among these individual communities. Based {{on data from}} the U.S. Census Bureau and the City of Houston (2008, where available, and 2000 otherwise), the area demographic statistics are as follows (see table for more details). The total population was approximately 566,850. The median household income was $56,827. The white population was 72.9%, the African American population was 8.3%, and the Asian population was 3.9%.|$|E

5|$|The temple {{properties}} were {{no longer}} cultivated, and tanks were not maintained. Thus the population was surviving on slash and burn agriculture. British colonial policies favored the conversion of these lands into lucrative coconut plantations quickly covering all suitable Pattuva lands. Establishments of large-scale plantations also led to population increase due to migration and settlement of plantation workers from {{the interior of the}} country. This led to <b>a</b> <b>demographic</b> change, and the local Pattuva people became disassociated from the temple and its administration.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{start of}} <b>a</b> <b>demographic</b> shift {{downwards}} when the Royal Navy {{pulled out of}} Deptford, and the docks moved into storage and freight. The downward shift continued into the 20th century as the local population's dependency on the docks continued: as the docks themselves declined, so did the economic fortune of the inhabitants until the last dock, Convoys Wharf, closed in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Winnipeg {{developed}} rapidly {{after the}} coming of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1881. The railway divided the North End, which housed mainly Eastern Europeans, from the richer Anglo-Saxon southern part of the city. It also contributed to <b>a</b> <b>demographic</b> shift beginning shortly after Confederation that saw the francophone population decrease from a majority to a small minority group. This shift resulted in Premier Thomas Greenway controversially ending legislative bilingualism and removing funding for French Catholic Schools in 1890.|$|E

5|$|In the 1950s, ore output was renewed in the region, briefly revitalizing Chiprovtsi {{through the}} influx of young and highly educated people. On 12 September 1968, Chiprovtsi was officially proclaimed a town by the National Assembly of Bulgaria. In Socialist times, the town had a factory that {{produced}} AK-47 magazines and employed about 400 people. After the democratic changes in 1989, mining was discontinued again {{due to a lack}} of funds, the factory was closed and the carpet industry has been in decline as it had lost its firm foreign markets. As a result, the town and the municipality have been experiencing <b>a</b> <b>demographic</b> crisis.|$|E
5|$|The British {{moved the}} capital to New Delhi in 1911. Calcutta {{continued}} to be a centre for revolutionary organisations associated with the Indian independence movement. The city and its port were bombed several times by the Japanese between 1942 and 1944, during World War II. Coinciding with the war, millions starved to death during the Bengal famine of 1943 due to a combination of military, administrative, and natural factors. Demands {{for the creation of a}} Muslim state led in 1946 to an episode of communal violence that killed over 4,000. The partition of India led to further clashes and <b>a</b> <b>demographic</b> shiftâ€”many Muslims left for East Pakistan (present day Bangladesh), while hundreds of thousands of Hindus fled into the city.|$|E
5|$|The studio defined only Blythe and {{the pets}} as characters, so the Cahills sought {{to expand the}} human character's fictional universe, {{designing}} Blythe's friends, Mrs. Twombly, and the Biskit twins. Julie explained {{that she and her}} husband's preference for quirky comedy inspired that of the show. While the show is aimed at <b>a</b> <b>demographic</b> of young girls, Julie said that she and the writers attempt to cater to boys of the same age and parent viewers simultaneously. Original music for the show is accomplished by film and television composers Daniel Ingram and Steffan Andrews. Ingram wrote that the urban setting of Littlest Pet Shop prompted the use of a modern style of music. The score incorporates pop and other cultural influences for the same reason. Ingram found Hasbro's pushing of the limitations for music in daytime television a source of pride.|$|E

5|$|Upon its {{establishment}} in 1871, Germany was about two-thirds Protestant and one-third Roman Catholic, with a notable Jewish minority. Other faiths {{existed in the}} state, but never achieved <b>a</b> <b>demographic</b> significance and cultural impact of these three confessions. Germany lost nearly all of its Jewish minority during the Holocaust. Religious makeup changed gradually in the decades following 1945, with West Germany becoming more religiously diversified through immigration and East Germany becoming overwhelmingly irreligious through state policies. It continues to diversify after the German reunification in 1990, with an accompanying substantial decline in religiosity throughout all of Germany and a contrasting increase of Evangelical Protestants and Muslims.|$|E
