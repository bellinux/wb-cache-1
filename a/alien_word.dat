Looking back in 1963, David wrote, [...] "In Soho but almost nowhere else, such things as Italian pasta, and Parmesan cheese, olive oil, salame, and occasionally Parma ham were to be had. With southern vegetables such as aubergines, red and green peppers, fennel, the tiny marrows called by the French courgettes and in Italy zucchini, much the same situation prevailed." [...] David was less en rapport with Italy than with Greece and southern France and found preparing and writing her Italian Food (1954) [...] "uncommonly troublesome". The effort she put into the book was recognised by reviewers. The Times Literary Supplement wrote, [...] "More than a collection of recipes, this book is in effect a readable and discerning dissertation on Italian food and regional dishes, and their preparation in the English kitchen."

60|$|After Gunnar {{he was a}} {{long while}} in {{striking}} another note so true. He did not strike it again till he wrote 'The Mammon of Unrighteousness', and after that he was sometimes of a wandering and uncertain touch. There are certain stories of his which I cannot read without a painful sense of their inequality not only to his talent, but to his knowledge of human nature, and of American character. He understood our character quite {{as well as he}} understood our language, but at times he seemed not to do so. I think these were the times when he was overworked, and ought to have been resting instead of writing. In such fatigue one loses command of <b>alien</b> <b>words,</b> <b>alien</b> situations; and in estimating Boyesen's achievements we must never forget that he was born strange to our language and to our life. In 'Gunnar' he handled the one with grace and charm; in his great novel he handled both with masterly strength. I call 'The Mammon of Unrighteousness' a great novel, and I am quite willing to say that I know few novels by born Americans that surpass it in dealing with American types and conditions. It has the vast horizon of the masterpieces of fictions; its meanings are not for its characters alone, but for every reader of it; when you close the book the story is not at an end.|$|R

50|$|Sam's {{starting}} location. Similar to the Living Islands, organic balloons {{are clustered}} in a gaseous atmosphere. Base Three {{was set up}} here, authorized by Dr. Frances Bremmer. Dr. Richard Hoviz' log is here, as is Bremmer's, the only two logs viewable in the CD version. On the edge of Sam's first balloon area are several compasses and a horn with coils jutting from its bell. The horn itself, with an elaborate gold apparatus behind it, makes automated blasts of air. Next to Hoviz' log is a large device shaped like a musical instrument, which, after pressing gold tabs with the same markings from each compass in a unique pattern, it seems to suck blue pearls used as money from the atmosphere through the horn's coils. The symbols on each tab also create wheezing sounds of <b>alien</b> <b>words,</b> which are also used with the mechanical computer on Bosh. A cable car, leading past several mushroom-shaped hot-air balloons, connects one of the organic balloons to {{what seems to be}} a massive flower hovering a few meters from the surface. After experimenting with a pair of gas collection devices and a message from Dr. Bremmer, it turns out that this flower was actually a launch site for several blimps. It seems that the collectors would fill any blimp(s) in the area for flight. By the time Sam arrives, there is only one. Bremmer's log mentions that a scientist named Susan recently used another one. Nothing else is known about this realm.|$|R
40|$|To the {{observe the}} periods of electoral campaigns, we can realize sharply the {{abundance}} of political propaganda that announces the candidates, their campaign record, their proposed and everything that can carry them to the victory in the urns. The propaganda is today an essential tool in the votes dispute, in consequence of this, there is, in Brazil, the increasing participation of the Politics Parties in seminars of electoral marketing. They are varied strategies of the media used in the divulging of the candidacies, among them the slogan. Instigated by the explicit relation media/political, this work intends to investigate the ideologies (values) announced by the slogans of political propaganda that circulated in electoral periods. Thus, we base on {{the theory of the}} Circle of Bakhtin, who considers the statement as unit of the verbal communication, and that conceives the language as phenomenon dialogical, and, too, in the conceptions of <b>alien</b> <b>words,</b> social voices and dialogical relations formulated by the referred theory. We use, for better to comprehend, the slogan as strategy mediatic, of the classical study done by Olivier Reboul concerning the slogan; and, like starting point of a conception about ideology, studied John Thompson to comprehends the ideological phenomenon. Our corpus it constitutes of 14 political slogans announced in the campaigns for mayor of the cities in Natal and Mossoró, both located in Rio Grande do Norte s state, Brazil, in 1996, 2000 and 2004. For the analysis of these slogans, we consider the social-historical context in which were announced, being contemplated the linguistic and discursive aspect, according to the following methodological order: the identification of <b>alien</b> <b>words</b> (interdiscours); the social voices and the kinds dialogical relations established; and, finally, the ideology announced by the statement. This way, we can arrive to the conclusion that in the electoral context occurs a true ideologies war, in other words, in the political game of an electoral campaign, the slogans announces different values, which vary in several factors function, for example, the historicity, the subject that enunciates, the discursive positionings. Ao observarmos os períodos de campanhas eleitorais, podemos perceber nitidamente a abundância de propaganda política que divulga os candidatos, sua agenda de campanha, suas propostas e tudo o mais que possa levá-los à vitória nas urnas. A propaganda é hoje uma ferramenta essencial na disputa de votos, em conseqüência disso, há, no Brasil, a crescente participação dos partidos em seminários de marketing eleitoral. São variadas estratégias midiáticas utilizadas na divulgação das candidaturas, dentre elas o slogan. Instigados pela explícita relação mídia/política, este trabalho pretende investigar as ideologias (valores) veiculadas pelos slogans de propaganda política que circularam em períodos eleitorais. Para tanto, nos ancoramos na teoria do Círculo de Bakhtin, que considera o enunciado como unidade da comunicação verbal, e que concebe a linguagem como fenômeno dialógico, e, ainda, nas concepções de já-dito, vozes sociais e relações dialógicas formuladas pela referida teoria. Lançamos mão também, para melhor compreender o slogan como estratégia midiática, do estudo clássico feito por Olivier Reboul acerca do slogan; e, como ponto de partida de uma concepção sobre ideologia, vimos como John Thompson compreende o fenômeno ideológico. Nosso corpus constitui-se de 14 slogans políticos veiculados nas campanhas para prefeito das cidades de Natal e Mossoró, ambas localizadas no estado Rio Grande do Norte, Brasil, em 1996, 2000 e 2004. Para a análise desses slogans, consideramos o contexto sócio-histórico nos quais foram veiculados, sendo contemplado o aspecto lingüístico e discursivo, de acordo com a seguinte ordem metodológica: a identificação dos já-ditos (interdiscurso); as vozes sociais e os tipos de relações dialógicas estabelecidas; e, por fim, a ideologia veiculada pelo enunciado. Com isso, podemos chegar à conclusão de que no contexto eleitoral ocorre uma verdadeira guerra de ideologias, ou seja, no jogo político de uma campanha eleitoral, os slogans veiculam diferentes valores, que variam em função de diversos fatores, por exemplo, a historicidade, os sujeitos enunciadores, os posicionamentos discursivos...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The term “alien hand ” {{refers to}} a variety of clini-cal {{conditions}} whose common characteristic is the uncon-trolled behavior or the feeling of strangeness of one extremity, most commonly the left hand. A common classification distin-guishes between the posterior or sensory form of the alien hand, and the anterior or motor form of this condition. However, there are inconsistencies, such as the phenomenon of diagonistic dyspraxia, which is largely a motor syndrome despite being more frequently associated with posterior cal-losal lesions. We discuss critically the existing nomenclature and we also describe a case recently reported by us which does not fit any previously reported condition, termed agonistic dyspraxia. We propose that the cases of alien hand described in the literature can be classified into at least five broad cate-gories: (i) diagonistic dyspraxia and related syndromes, (ii) alien hand, (iii) way-ward hand and related syndromes, (iv) supernumerary hands and (v) agonistic dyspraxia.

40|$|At first sight, dissociative {{identity}} disorder (DID) and schizophrenia seemas {{far apart}} as any two conditions could be. DID is almost entirely seenas an immediate consequence of severe early abuse (Fonagy & Target, 1995), whereas schizophrenia is largely seen as a genetic predisposition that does not surface until late adolescence or adulthood. However, this consensus view, this reality, falls apart when the surface is scratched. In particular, the genetic predisposition is minimal, and largely irrelevant to prevention, treat-ment, or healing. Perhaps surprisingly, a diagnosis of DID is seen as controversial {{in spite of the}} consistency of diagnosis, yet the far less reliable diagnosis of schizophrenia is seen as science that is as hard and <b>alien</b> as the <b>word</b> itself. This misperception may be a consequence of the widely quoted 50 % concordance rate for schizo-phrenia between identical twins (schizophrenia. com) (Frith and Johnstone, 2003). Were this to be true, it might indicate that schizophrenia is primarily a genetic disease and might respond to drugs and brain operations. I, like many others, would assume this figure is meaningless unless it is confined to twins reared apart, and I have joined many professionals in being surprised to fin...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} Mamin-Sibiriak’s Legends (1898) cycle, {{which appeared}} {{at the time when}} legends in Russia were at the peak of popularity. The cycle is a masterful stylization of Asian folk tales belonging to some of the minorities of the Russian Empire, and it fuses together Oriental and Occidental literary and geopoetic traditions. The background of the cycle creation and an analysis of the Asian and European roots of the legends reveal {{the ways in which the}} two cultures are combined by the author. Mamin-Sibiryak uses Oriental stylization, typical of the folk-lore of minor ethnic groups of the Trans-Urals, on the levels of language and imagery. His artful employment of linguistic and poetic devices such as foreign <b>words,</b> <b>alien</b> names and realias, zoomorphic metaphors and similes, as well as concepts and sets of values not typical of European mentality, misled his contemporaries into thinking that he had published some collected folk material. However, the writer created his own plots, following patterns and motifs mostly characteristic of both Western and Eastern cultures. There are similarities between the plots and the motifs of the cycle and those of the European Romanticism, Buddhism, Indian epics, and Biblical scenes. Consequently, Mamin-Sibiryak’s choice of plots may be aimed at identifying some basic similarities between these traditions. A study of the cycle proves that the impact on the legends by A. Schopenhauer’s philosophy, which exploits ideas shared by Eastern and Western cultures, contributes to the interaction of Occidental and Oriental cultures within the cycle on the underlying levels, though the connotation of some Eastern motifs is contradictory to the Western tradition. While creating the legends, the author did not aim just at making the Russian reader acquainted with the folklore of minority groups. Rather, the chosen ‘alien’ form was intended to help the reader forget about everyday life and perceive some eternal truths concerning morals, history, a person’s predestination, and love. We argue that the writer intentionally combined Eastern and Western cultural and literary traditions to achieve a greater effect on his readers...|$|R
