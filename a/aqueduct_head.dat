50|$|There are two bridges in the district. The older {{of the two}} carries Massachusetts Route 30 {{over the}} open channel below the dam, and was built in 1898. It is a {{concrete}} twin-arch bridge, faced in granite. The second bridge, a single-arch span made of similar materials, carries an access road over the open channel to the Weston <b>Aqueduct</b> <b>head</b> house, and was built in 1902-3.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of {{the opening}} of the Los Angeles <b>Aqueduct</b> <b>head</b> gate, November 5, 1913. Approximately five men are turning the large valves {{situated}} on a ledge above the aqueduct. Spectators on nearby hills and near the canals watch as the water flows from the man-made aqueduct. Among the spectators are two police officers (lower right). A set of stairs leads to the ledge where the men are operating the valves. Bushes cover the top of the hills above the aqueduct. Picture file card reads: "Construction of the aqueduct began in 1908. Nov. 5, 1913, William Mullholland, the project engineer, opened the valves that led the waters of the mountains 250 miles away flow into the Los Angeles district. ...|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} plan {{to complete the}} Ellesmere Canal was to connect Chester directly to the Wrexham coalfields by building a broad-gauge waterway with a branch to the River Dee at Holt. If the waterway had been built, canal traffic would have crossed the Pontcysyllte <b>Aqueduct</b> <b>heading</b> north to Chester and the River Dee.|$|R
50|$|It is most {{commonly}} referred to as the origin of the Aqua Anio Novus, a major <b>aqueduct</b> whose <b>head</b> was originally at the 38th milestone of the Via Sublacensis.|$|R
50|$|The Eastern Diversion {{starts at}} the Waiharakeke Stream, a {{tributary}} to the Whangaehu River, where the diversion starts. Water from here and 22 other intakes, including from the Waihianoa and Makahikato Streams, passes into the 8.4 km long underground Wahianoa <b>Aqueduct.</b> The <b>aqueduct</b> <b>heads</b> eastward, passing under the actual Whangaehu River, but not taking any water from it {{due to the fact}} it drains Mount Ruapehu's crater lake and is too acidic. At the end of the aqueduct, near the Desert Road (State Highway 1), water is then diverted through the 1.4 km Mangaio Tunnel under the State Highway and either into Mangaio Power Station or a drop structure to enter Lake Moawhango via the Mangaio Stream.|$|R
50|$|Karnali river brings heavy sediments during monsoon {{season and}} {{deposits}} in the canal beds {{and the field}} every year. Every year more than 2500 farmers contribute their muscle power to dig and clear the sediment deposits in the canal bed. Previously, it required {{more than two months}} of work to control the amount of water coming into Maila Nala from Geruwa. Every year earthen dam used to be reconstructed or repaired. Material used in the dam were, non compacted slab of soil called chapari or chyapa, branches of trees and cobbles and boulders. Thanks to the Rajapur Irrigation Project which constructed concrete dams. It also constructed many <b>aqueducts,</b> <b>head</b> and cross regulaters and off-sets at different locations in the canal system.|$|R
50|$|The {{aqueduct}} {{begins at}} the Clifton Court Forebay at the southwestern corner of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. The <b>aqueduct</b> then <b>heads</b> south, eventually splitting into three branches: the Coastal Branch, ending at Lake Cachuma in Santa Barbara County; the West Branch, conveying water to Castaic Lake in Los Angeles County; and the East Branch, connecting Silverwood Lake in San Bernardino County.|$|R
5000|$|The route winds {{past the}} site of the {{junction}} with the Burslem Arm, and then past Westport Park Lake. It then heads in a straight line for the southern entrance to Harecastle Tunnel. The present tunnel is the second constructed through the hill. Brindley's first tunnel was finished in 1777, but at around 1.75 mi and with no towpath, it acted as a bottleneck, as boats had to be legged through. Thomas Telford designed a second parallel tunnel, which was completed in 1827 and included a towpath. Brindley's tunnel was abandoned in the twentieth century, after it was affected by mining subsidence. The length of Telford's tunnel is 2926 yd, and an electric tug was used between 1914 and 1954 to speed up traffic through it. Just beyond the northern portal, the Macclesfield Canal turns off to the south and runs parallel to the main line, which drops through two locks, before the Macclesfield crosses over on an <b>aqueduct</b> and <b>heads</b> north.|$|R
50|$|At the junction, {{the ring}} turns left again, to head {{north on the}} Trent and Mersey Canal. The canal follows the Trent Valley, as do the A51 road and the railway from Rugeley to Stoke. The first four locks are spread out, but in Stone there are four more. They are quite deep, with an average rise of 10 ft. They are {{followed}} by the four Meaford locks and Trentham Lock before the countryside is replaced by urban sprawl. On {{the southern edge of}} Stoke-on-Trent, the River Trent turns to the north east, while the canal crosses it on an <b>aqueduct</b> and <b>heads</b> to the north west. There are five more locks before the junction with the Caldon Canal, which was built as a branch of the Trent and Mersey, but is now considered to be a separate canal. The junction is overlooked by a large statue of James Brindley, the engineer who built the canal. The junction is also the start of the summit level, as the ring descends from here to the start point at Middlewich.|$|R
