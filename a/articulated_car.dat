50|$|The {{noise level}} in the trains during tunnel {{passages}} was also subject to passenger complaints. A reduction by 3-4 dB was achieved by retrofitting all trains with longer mud flaps at car ends until May 2006 to smooth the airflow at the <b>articulated</b> <b>car</b> joints. However, measurements in 2009 found significantly higher interior noise levels at some locations in two tunnels. Window thickness and sound insulation was improved in the KTX-II.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} workshops eventually {{closed on}} 16 June 1962, the last locomotive to be repaired at Ashford being N class 2-6-0 no. 31400 on 9 June. The wagon works continued {{for a further}} two decades producing continental ferry vans, Freightliner vehicles, merry-go-round coal hopper wagons and the Cartic4 <b>articulated</b> <b>car</b> transporter. It became one of BREL's main wagon works, but as trade declined it operated on an ever-decreasing scale until it closed down in 1982.|$|E

50|$|The {{noise level}} in the trains during tunnel {{passages}} was subject to passenger complaints. Tests in August 2005 showed that noise level reductions of 3-4 dB can be achieved with an increase of the so-called mud flaps, the rubber bands attached {{to the end of}} the intermediate cars to smooth the airflow at the <b>articulated</b> <b>car</b> joints, from a width of 100 to 143 mm. Korail then retrofitted all trains with the wider mud flaps until May 2006.|$|E
5000|$|The U2's {{dimensions}} are 24.284 m by 2.650 m by 3.66 m. In the US and Canada, usually {{up to five}} U2 cars are coupled to run as a train. Each <b>articulated</b> <b>car</b> has a total passenger capacity of 264 passengers. It may be equipped with two DC motors for a total power output of [...] and a maximum speed of 80 km/h, or with four AC motors for an output of [...] and speed of 88 km/h.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the Hansa-built stock {{dating from the}} 1960s was {{scheduled}} for replacement. Since the BSAG had already invested in low-floor buses, low-floor tram vehicles were wanted as well. In 1990, the BSAG presented a prototype to the public. This three-section <b>articulated</b> <b>car</b> was the world's first 100% low-floor tram. From 1993 to 1996, 78 low-floor trams, classed as type GT8N, were ordered from AEG. Their main difference from the prototype {{is that they have}} four sections instead of three, hence offering more space and so more beneficial for wheelchair users. One vehicle has been taken out of service after an accident. The prototype was sold to the Norrköping tramways in Sweden in 1999.|$|E

50|$|The MS was an <b>{{articulated}}</b> <b>car</b> {{made up of}} five sections. Their {{average length}} was 170 ft, making them the longest articulated units ever used {{in the history of}} the BMT. The first two pilot cars, numbered 7003 and 7029, were delivered in 1934 by the Budd Company and Pullman Company. The Pullman version was known as the Green Hornet, while Budd's was called the Zephyr, both names being unofficial. The Green Hornet (and the 25 production cars) had two double-leaf doors on each section (10 doors per unit), while the Zephyr had four single-leaf doors on each section (20 doors per unit). These cars were in production at the same time as the Union Pacific M-10000 and the Budd Pioneer Zephyr for the CB&Q. Testing of these cars proved successful and the BMT ordered a further 25 cars, 15 from Pullman and 10 from St. Louis Car Co.|$|E
50|$|It {{was only}} after World War II that <b>articulated</b> <b>cars</b> were {{manufactured}} again; the first, small series of GT4 Jacobs bogie cars was deployed for Stuttgart in 1953 by Maschinenfabrik Esslingen.From 1956 on, Düsseldorfer Waggonfabrik (Düwag) manufactured large numbers of <b>articulated</b> tram <b>cars</b> for operators in Germany and abroad to replace old pre-war models.|$|R

50|$|<b>Articulated</b> <b>cars</b> have {{a number}} of advantages. They save on the total number of wheels and bogies, {{reducing}} initial cost, weight, noise, vibration and maintenance expenses. Further, movement between passenger cars is safer and easier than with traditional designs.|$|R

2500|$|On 10 November 2011 [...] (Wuppertal {{public utility}} company) signed a {{contract}} with Vossloh Kiepe to supply 31 new <b>articulated</b> <b>cars</b> to replace those built in the 1970s. The new cars were built in Valencia, Spain. When they were introduced the line's power supply voltage was raised from 600 to 750V.|$|R
5000|$|From 1980 onwards, {{the class}} N1 and n2 cars were {{gradually}} replaced by new six-axle <b>articulated</b> <b>cars.</b> These {{are referred to}} as class E6 (motor cars) and c6 (trailers) and are based on the Duewag [...] "Mannheim" [...] design. These were in service until the Stadtbahn service officially ended in 1989.|$|R
5000|$|Often tilting and {{high-speed}} {{cars are}} left in [...] "trainsets" [...] throughout their service. For example, <b>articulated</b> <b>cars</b> cannot be uncoupled without special equipment because the individual cars share trucks. This gives modern trains a smooth, coherent appearance because all the cars and often the engines share a similar design and paint scheme.|$|R

50|$|The E331 series (E331系) was an {{electric}} multiple unit (EMU) train introduced experimentally from 2007 on commuter services on the Keiyo Line in Japan operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East). Only one trainset was built, and it differed significantly from other JR commuter EMUs in having <b>articulated</b> <b>cars</b> with shared bogies and using direct-drive motors.|$|R
50|$|In {{concert with}} US and Canadian Westinghouse, diesel engines were {{developed}} and installed for railway self-propelled car use. Canadian National Railways had two <b>articulated</b> <b>cars</b> powered with Beardmore 320 hp engines, eight cars with 185 hp engines, and seven cars with 300 hp engines. Several American railroads had self-propelled cars fitted with Westinghouse engines derived from Beardmore designs.|$|R
50|$|In 1958, Sarajevo bought 50 {{relatively}} modern PCC-cars from Washington, renumbered in the 1-50 series. 21 more PCC-cars from Washington {{followed in}} 1962, numbered 51-71. These 71 PCC-cars were built between 1941 and 1944 by the St. Louis Car Company. Between 1967 and 1969, 20 of these streetcars were transformed into 10 <b>articulated</b> <b>cars</b> series 100-109.|$|R

50|$|After the D-types entered service, all {{subsequent}} rapid transit equipment {{ordered by the}} BMT, both production and experimental, were articulated units. Since the City of New York acquired the BMT in June 1940, no more <b>articulated</b> <b>cars</b> have ever been purchased for the New York City Subway, although an open-gangway experimental train, {{which is part of}} the R211 contract, may bring this back.|$|R
50|$|<b>Articulated</b> <b>cars</b> are not, however, a new idea. Many {{railways}} in Britain {{during the}} first half of the 20th century frequently rebuilt older, shorter <b>cars</b> into <b>articulated</b> sets, and the Great Northern Railway in Britain built suburban car sets new. In the 1930s, a number of streamlined trains built for the London and North Eastern Railway also made use of articulated technology.|$|R
