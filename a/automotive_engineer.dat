25|$|The Hungarian <b>automotive</b> <b>engineer</b> Nicholas Straussler had {{designed}} an armoured car (AC1) in 1932, {{which was built}} by the Manfred Weiss company under licence in Budapest. When Hungary aligned itself with Germany soon after that, Straussler emigrated to England. Straussler's small new company, Straussler Mechanisations Ltd, lacked the necessary resources and capacity to build the vehicle on a large scale, so Straussler approached Alvis, and Alvis-Straussler Ltd, a short-lived joint venture company, was formed in July 1936. The prototype vehicle produced, the Alvis Straussler AC2, was built upon the AC1 chassis. The first AC3– the first operational purpose-built armoured car ever produced– was delivered in 1937 by Alvis-Straussler Ltd, built upon the AC2 prototype. Twenty-seven vehicles were built: 12 for the Royal Air Force, 3 for the Portuguese Army, and 12 for the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army.|$|E

2500|$|Gladwell {{also noted}} that SUV {{popularity}} is also a sign that people began to shift automobile safety focus from active to passive, {{to the point that}} in the US potential SUV buyers will give up an extra [...] of braking distance because they believe they are helpless to avoid a tractor-trailer hit on any vehicle. The four-wheel drive option available to SUVs reinforced the passive safety notion. To support Gladwell's argument, he mentioned that <b>automotive</b> <b>engineer</b> David Champion noted that in his previous driving experience with Range Rover, his vehicle slid across a four-lane road because he did not perceive the slipping that others had experienced. Gladwell concluded that when a driver feels unsafe when driving a vehicle, it makes the vehicle safer. When a driver feels safe when driving, the vehicle becomes less safe.|$|E
