5|$|In {{extreme cases}} of {{intractable}} CSF leak, a surgical lumbar drain has been used. This procedure {{is believed to}} decrease spinal CSF volume while increasing intracranial CSF pressure <b>and</b> <b>volume.</b> This procedure restores normal intracranial CSF volume and pressure while promoting the healing of dural tears by lowering the pressure <b>and</b> <b>volume</b> in the dura. This procedure has led to positive results leading to relief of symptoms for up to one year.|$|E
5|$|The {{pipe organ}} is a musical {{instrument}} that produces sound by driving pressurized air (called wind) through organ pipes selected via a keyboard. Because each pipe produces a single pitch, the pipes are provided in sets called ranks, {{each of which has}} a common timbre <b>and</b> <b>volume</b> throughout the keyboard compass. Most organs have multiple ranks of pipes of differing timbre, pitch, <b>and</b> <b>volume</b> that the player can employ singly or in combination through the use of controls called stops.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{investigate}} the distribution of futures market returns <b>and</b> <b>volumes.</b> A variety of contracts are selected from agriculture, foreign exchange, industrial, equity and interest rate market sectors. Tests of normality indicate that all daily returns <b>and</b> daily <b>volumes</b> are not normally distributed. Monthly returns <b>and</b> <b>volumes</b> display mixed results. Furthermore, negative and positive excess returns are compared for each contract. Nonparametric tests are used to assess whether returns <b>and</b> <b>volumes</b> are symmetric about the mean, concluding that daily returns <b>and</b> <b>volumes</b> are asymmetric. However, the results for monthly data are mixed. The Wilcoxon rank sum test suggests that although most contract returns appear asymmetric, soybean, cocoa and 10 -year US Treasury note returns are symmetric. Results for the monthly volume data are also mixed suggesting that the distributions may become more normal as the time period examined increases. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{magazine}} was bimonthly until the March 1954 issue, which {{was followed by}} April 1954, inaugurating a monthly period that ran until June 1955. This was followed by August 1955, resuming a bimonthly schedule that ran until July 1964, with only one irregularity, when the February 1959 issue was followed by July 1959. After July 1964, If ran a monthly schedule until April 1970, with three omissions: there were no issues dated September 1964, June 1969, or August 1969. From May–June 1970, the issues were bimonthly and bore the names of two months. This bimonthly sequence ran through the last issue {{at the end of}} 1974. The date the magazine printed on the cover reverted to a single month with the June 1971 issue, though the contents page still used two months to identify the issue. The volume numbering began with six issues to a volume: there were three errors on the magazine contents page, with volume 8 number 1 incorrectly printed as volume 7 number 6; volume 9 number 3 printed as volume 8 number 6; <b>and</b> <b>volume</b> 10 number 1 printed as volume 10 number 6.

He then derives the slightly more complex scaling laws for birds or aircraft in flight. He shows that an organism thousands of times smaller than a bacterium is essentially impossible.|$|E

5|$|Accompanying {{the changes}} to timbre <b>and</b> <b>volume</b> was {{a shift in the}} typical pitch used to tune instruments. Instruments meant to play together, as in an orchestra, must be tuned to the same {{standard}} lest they produce audibly different sounds while playing the same notes. Beginning in 1762, the average concert pitch began rising from a low of 377 vibrations to a high of 457 in 1880 Vienna. Different regions, countries, and even instrument manufacturers preferred different standards, making orchestral collaboration a challenge. Despite even the efforts of two organized international summits attended by noted composers like Hector Berlioz, no standard could be agreed upon.|$|E

Andrianampoinimerina decreed Friday (Zoma) as market day, when merchants would come to Analakely to erect stalls shaded with traditional white parasols. This sea of parasols extended throughout the valley, forming {{what has been called}} the largest open air marketplace in the world. Traffic congestion and safety hazards caused by the ever-growing Zoma market prompted government officials to split up and relocate the Friday merchants to several other districts in 1997. Prosperity for the masses in Imerina increased throughout Andrianampoinimerina's reign, leading to growth in population density.|$|E
