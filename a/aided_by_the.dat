30|$|In all {{the three}} sites, {{government}} interventions, {{largely in the}} form of food <b>aid,</b> were seen <b>by</b> participants as important in enhancing their ability to cope with the impacts of droughts (Table  3). Food <b>aid</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> national government consisted of distribution of a few bags of cereals (mainly millet, sorghum, and maize) to the affected households. Most of <b>the</b> food <b>aid</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> national government was donated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> foreign governments, particularly {{in the case of the}} severe drought of 2005 in Niger. However, food <b>aid</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> government is not always regular and is often not well targeted, largely due to dependence of the government on foreign donations and government bureaucracy in the distribution of aid. Another major problem with government assistance in coping with droughts in pastoral and agro-pastoral communities is that it is often reactive and mainly focused on relief service (Barton et al. 2001) for those made destitute by drought, which suggests absence of a long-term national adaptation plan and financing mechanisms in coping with the impacts of climate change. According to the workshop participants, drought-related assistance from NGOs to the communities was minimal or none except for the drought of 2005 (Table  3) which attracted worldwide attention due to its severity.|$|R
