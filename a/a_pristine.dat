5|$|The composited camera {{negative}} of Citizen Kane {{was destroyed}} in a New Jersey film laboratory fire in the 1970s. Subsequent prints were derived from a master positive (a fine-grain preservation element) made in the 1940s and originally intended for use in overseas distribution. Modern techniques were used to produce <b>a</b> <b>pristine</b> print for a 50th Anniversary theatrical reissue in 1991 which Paramount released for then-owner Turner Broadcasting System, which earned $1.6 million in North America.|$|E
5|$|The {{work was}} {{inspired}} by Jacques-Louis David's series of five Napoleon Crossing the Alps paintings (1801–1805). David's works also show Napoleon's journey through the Great St. Bernard Pass, but there are significant stylistic {{differences between the two}} conceptions. Delaroche's Napoleon is cold and downcast, whereas David's wears <b>a</b> <b>pristine</b> uniform, and is idealized as a hero. Delaroche was commissioned to paint a realistic portrait; the style of which was emerging at the time.|$|E
5|$|After being {{selected}} in April 1945, Hiroshima was spared conventional bombing {{to serve as}} <b>a</b> <b>pristine</b> target, where {{the effects of a}} nuclear bomb on an undamaged city could be observed. While damage could be studied later, the energy yield of the untested Little Boy design could be determined only at the moment of detonation, using instruments dropped by parachute from a plane flying in formation with the one that dropped the bomb. Radio-transmitted data from these instruments indicated a yield of about 15 kilotons.|$|E

5|$|Sangay {{is one of}} two active volcanoes {{located within}} the namesake Sangay National Park, the other being Tungurahua to the north. As such it has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983. The area's {{isolation}} has allowed it to maintain <b>a</b> <b>pristine</b> ecology relatively untouched by human interaction, and the park hosts a biome ranging from alpine glaciers on the volcanoes' peaks to tropical forest on their flanks. Altitude and rainfall are the most significant local factors affecting fauna, and therefore the most lush ecosystems are found on the wetter parts of the volcano's eastern slope.|$|E
5|$|Crysta is a fairy with {{a curious}} nature living in FernGully, <b>a</b> <b>pristine</b> {{rainforest}} free from human intervention. The fairies of FernGully {{once lived in}} harmony with humans, but believe them to have gone extinct after having been driven away by a dark spirit named Hexxus. Crysta is the apprentice of Magi, a motherly-figure fairy who imprisoned Hexxus in a tree. One day Crysta explores a new part of the forest and meets Batty, a bat {{who claims to have}} been experimented on by humans, giving him an obstreperous and unstable personality. However, fairies refuse to believe him, except for Crysta, who volunteers to investigate the situation. She sees Zak, a young lumberjack whom Crysta accidentally shrinks when she tries to save him from being crushed by a falling tree, though does not know how to restore him to normal size.|$|E

25|$|San Diego–Tijuana is also {{subject to}} El Niño weather events. In extreme cases, the {{overwhelming}} fall of rain creates mudslides and greatly increases {{the flow of}} urban rivers.

25|$|A {{parallel}} {{has been}} drawn between these {{activities and the}} human condition according to the Biblical account of the expulsion from the garden of Eden. Refraining from these symbolically represents a return to <b>a</b> <b>pristine</b> state, which {{is the theme of}} the day. By refraining from these activities, the body is uncomfortable but can still survive. The soul is considered to be the life force in a body. Therefore, by making one’s body uncomfortable, one’s soul is uncomfortable. By feeling pain one can feel how others feel when they are in pain. This is the purpose of the prohibitions.|$|E
25|$|Historical ecology {{challenges}} {{the very notion}} of <b>a</b> <b>pristine</b> landscape, such as virgin rainforests. The idea that the landscape of the New World was uninhabited and unchanged by those groups that did inhabit it was fundamental to the justifications of colonialism. Thus, perceptions of landscape have profound consequences on the histories of societies and their interactions with the environment. All landscapes have been altered by various organisms and mechanisms prior to human existence on Earth. Humans have always transformed the landscapes they inhabit, however, and today there are no landscapes on Earth that have not been affected by humans in some way.|$|E

25|$|Too Much Johnson, a 1938 comedy film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Welles. Designed as the cinematic aspect of Welles's Mercury Theatre stage presentation of William Gillette's 1894 comedy, the film was not completely edited or publicly screened. Too Much Johnson was considered a lost film until August 2013 news reports that <b>a</b> <b>pristine</b> print was discovered in Italy in 2008. A copy restored by the George Eastman House museum was scheduled to premiere October 9, 2013, at the Pordenone Silent Film Festival, with a U.S. premiere to follow.

Produced by Bruce Goldstein and adapted and directed by Allen Lewis Rickman, it featured the Film Forum Players with live piano.|$|E
25|$|A {{regulation}} {{dating from}} 2010 renders the island a nature reserve under Norwegian jurisdiction. The {{aim of this}} regulation is to ensure the preservation of <b>a</b> <b>pristine</b> Arctic island and the marine life nearby, including the ocean floor. Landings at Jan Mayen {{can be done by}} boat. However, this is permitted only at {{a small part of the}} island, named Båtvika (Boat Bay). As there is no commercial airline operating at the island, one cannot get there by plane except by chartering one. Admission for landings by a charter plane has to be obtained in advance. Admission to stay on the island has to be obtained in advance, and is generally limited to a few days (or even hours). Putting up a tent or setting up camp is prohibited. There is a separate regulation for the stay of foreigners.|$|E

25|$|With over 5,500 fossils and 3,000 minerals, the {{strengths}} of the Scarborough collection are numerous type specimens, which were the first of their kind ever to be described, and one of the finest collections of Middle Jurassic fossil plants in the country. The collection also includes a large selection of Cretaceous fossils from the Speeton Clay and the Chalk, a wide variety of Upper and Lower Jurassic specimens, specimens from the Ice Age such as mammoth teeth and fossils from the Kirkdale Cave and <b>a</b> <b>pristine</b> Carboniferous plant collection. The whole collection was catalogued and conserved in 2007 and the more spectacular specimens are now on display in the refurbished Rotunda Museum. These give a taste of the quality and range of the fossils and minerals that have been found along Yorkshire's Dinosaur Coast which stretches from Redcar in the north to Flamborough in the south.|$|E
25|$|Continuing their journey, {{the player}} {{encounters}} the villainous Team Flare, whose goals at first {{seem to be}} geared towards making money off of Pokémon. Later encounters with Team Flare reveal their true goal to be the annihilation of humanity in order to return the world to <b>a</b> <b>pristine,</b> more beautiful state. In Shalour City, the player learns how to use Mega Evolution from the Mega Evolution guru Gurkinn and his granddaughter Korrina, {{who is also the}} Gym Leader of Shalour City. Defeating Korrina in a special Mega Evolution battle using Lucario, the player is given the ability to freely use Mega Evolution. The player then continues their journey, defeating Gym Leaders and stopping various schemes carried out by Team Flare. In the desert route Lumiose Badlands, the player defeats Team Flare during their attempt to steal energy from the region's power plant; this restores power to all of Lumiose City. Once the player obtains their seventh badge, they, and the rest of Kalos, are addressed by Lysandre through the Holo Caster (a holographic communication device); Lysandre informs them he is the leader of Team Flare and of his intention to destroy humanity.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1970s, {{numerous}} geoglyphs {{have been}} discovered on deforested land dating between AD 1–1250, furthering claims about Pre-Columbian civilizations. Ondemar Dias is accredited with first discovering the geoglyphs in 1977 and Alceu Ranzi with furthering their discovery after flying over Acre. The BBC's Unnatural Histories presented evidence that the Amazon rainforest, rather than being <b>a</b> <b>pristine</b> wilderness, has been shaped by man for at least 11,000 years through practices such as forest gardening and terra preta. Terra preta is found over large areas in the Amazon forest; and is now widely accepted {{as a product of}} indigenous soil management. The development of this fertile soil allowed agriculture and silviculture in the previously hostile environment; meaning that large portions of the Amazon rainforest are probably the result of centuries of human management, rather than naturally occurring as has previously been supposed. In the region of the Xingu tribe, remains of some of these large settlements {{in the middle of the}} Amazon forest were found in 2003 by Michael Heckenberger and colleagues of the University of Florida. Among those were evidence of roads, bridges and large plazas.|$|E
