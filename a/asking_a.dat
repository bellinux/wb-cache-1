5|$|James Device {{pleaded not}} guilty to the murders by {{witchcraft}} of Anne Townley and John Duckworth. However he, like Chattox, had earlier made a confession to Nowell, which was read out in court. That, and the evidence presented against him by his sister Jennet, who said that she had seen her brother <b>asking</b> <b>a</b> black dog he had conjured up to help him kill Townley, was sufficient to persuade the jury to find him guilty.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} to have {{concluded}} with Homer eating a pizza in his hospital bed following the operation, and with Marge <b>asking</b> <b>a</b> nurse where the pizza had come from. This reflects the earlier flashback scene where Grampa Simpson watches Homer as an infant, chewing on a slice of pizza in the hospital. The scene was replaced with the family cheering Homer on while he is in intensive care.|$|E

5|$|Twelve {{days after}} the disappearance, Robert Murat, a 34-year-old British-Portuguese {{property}} consultant, became the first arguido. Born in Hammersmith, west London, Murat lived in his mother's house, Casa Liliana, 150 yards (137 m) from apartment 5A in {{the direction in which}} the man in the Tanner sighting had walked. He was made an arguido after a Sunday Mirror journalist told police he had been <b>asking</b> <b>a</b> lot of questions about the case. The Polícia Judiciária had briefly signed him up as an official interpreter; he said he had wanted to help because he had a daughter in England around Madeleine's age.|$|E

He had to have emergency surgery at the Royal Victoria Infirmary hospital to have it sewn back on. A 32-year-old man from Hamilton, South Lanarkshire was charged over the incident and appeared before a magistrate in April 2013, and another man was released on bail in connection to the incident; a third man has been released without charge. In June 2014 the two accused were found not guilty of all charges.|$|E

25|$|The {{timing of}} their attack was {{carefully}} planned. After successfully <b>asking</b> <b>a</b> large Herero clan to surrender their weapons, Governor Leutwein {{was convinced that}} they {{and the rest of}} the native population were essentially pacified and so withdrew half of the German troops stationed in his colony. Led by Chief Samuel Maharero, the Herero surrounded Okahandja and cut links to Windhoek, the colonial capital. Maharero then issued a manifesto in which he forbade his troops to kill any Englishmen, Boers, uninvolved peoples, women and children in general, or German missionaries.|$|E
25|$|On the {{occasion}} of the Remilitarisation of the Rhineland in 1936 Hitler unconstitutionally and arbitrarily decreed a re-election of the Nazi puppet Reichstag for 29 March, which was Palm Sunday the traditional day Protestant congregations would celebrate the confirmations of the confirmands, who had grown to ecclesiastical adulthood. The compromising Wilhelm Zoellner, leading the Protestant church bodies in Germany (1935–1937), regarded this an unfriendly act against Protestantism, but nevertheless obeyed and tried to delay the confirmations, <b>asking</b> <b>a</b> furlough for confirmands from the compulsory agricultural season labour of the Deutsche Arbeitsfront (DAF), starting right next Monday. The DAF refused.|$|E
25|$|The ages of {{the victims}} ranged from six to thirteen. According to The Washington Post, police and coroner {{accounts}} of the children's wounds differed dramatically; Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Jeffrey B. Miller said Roberts shot his victims in the head at close range, with 17 or 18 shots fired in all, including the one he used to take his own life as police stormed into the school by breaking through the window glass.

25|$|Thomas is {{well known}} for his reticence during oral argument.

He also had a nearly seven-year streak of not speaking at all in any context, finally breaking that silence on January 14, 2013, when he was understood to have joked that a law degree from Yale may be proof of incompetence.|$|E
25|$|With the BLRC now {{halfway through}} the door, Britain sent a team to the Tour de France in 1955. It was the first team ever sent since the {{previous}} riders, Bill Burl and Charles Holland had competed as private entrants before the war. To turn down the Tour was something the NCU wouldn't do and yet it couldn't select riders who were BLRC members. To leave out BLRC members, however, would be to send a weakened team and antagonise a wavering UCI. Yet the BLRC could not select a team because the Union Cycliste Internationale didn't formally recognise it. The conundrum was solved by <b>asking</b> <b>a</b> panel of newspaper reporters {{to do the job}} instead.|$|E

There's even a short video on YouTube <b>asking</b> <b>a</b> young girl who the daughter of the prisoner why she's there at the protest. In terms of police presence, at one point it was reported that Saudi Investigation Units were in plain clothing especially after Saudi military forces withdrew.|$|E
