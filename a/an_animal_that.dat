5|$|For years, Europeans in Africa {{had heard}} of <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> they came to call the 'African unicorn'. In his travelogue of {{exploring}} the Congo, Henry Morton Stanley mentioned a kind of donkey that the natives called the atti, which scholars later identified as the okapi. Explorers may have seen the fleeting view of the striped backside as the animal fled through the bushes, leading to speculation that the okapi {{was some sort of}} rainforest zebra.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, Burney, who was {{studying}} recent extinctions in Madagascar, collected tales about a creature called the kilopilopitsofy {{that had been}} described by villagers {{in the town of}} Belo-sur-mer, a small fishing village on the west coast. Several villagers independently described <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> <b>that,</b> as recently as 1976, had entered their village, {{was the size of a}} cow, was dark pigmented, grunted a lot, and when threatened, fled underwater. No known animal on Madagascar fits the description but the animal seemed remarkably like a hippopotamus.|$|E

5|$|<b>An</b> <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> is {{commonly}} {{thought to be}} dazzle-patterned is the zebra. The bold stripes of the zebra have been claimed to be disruptive camouflage, background-blending and countershading. After many years in which {{the purpose of the}} coloration was disputed, an experimental study by Tim Caro suggested in 2012 that the pattern reduces the attractiveness of stationary models to biting flies such as horseflies and tsetse flies. However, a simulation study by Martin How and Johannes Zanker in 2014 suggests that when moving, the stripes may confuse observers, such as mammalian predators and biting insects, by two visual illusions: the wagon-wheel effect, where the perceived motion is inverted, and the barberpole illusion, where the perceived motion is in a wrong direction.|$|E
5|$|In Sanskrit literature, Sharabha is {{initially}} described as <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> roared and scared other {{animals in the}} hills and forest areas. Similies compare warriors to Sharabha. In the later epic Mahabharata, this form of Sharabha was exaggerated as a lion-slaying monster with eight legs, eyes on the top; living in the forest and which ate raw flesh. It is also mentioned as residing on Mount Krauncha but not as a monster but as an ordinary beast along with lions and tigers on mount Gandhamadana. The epic also includes Sharabha {{in the list of}} edible animals - the mrigajatis- the animal group of antelope, deer, hare, bear, ruru deer, sambar, gayal, boar, and buffalo - which was offered as part of food at dinner to guests. Sharabha also appears as a name of a monkey-king in the epic Ramayana, also as a proper name of heroes, apes, demons (danavas) and serpent Nāgas and one of the names of god Vishnu as well as Buddha. In defining the ecological theme in Hindu medicine related to jungle and the aroma of meats, Sharabha has also been listed among the deer natives of Kashmir, Nepal, and Sikkim. However, the features explained are of an eight legged animal of the size of a camel with huge horns and conjectured as a large Himalayan goat.|$|E
5|$|Since it {{is easier}} for a snake's tongue to fulfill its {{olfactory}} function under water, its action is short compared to that of terrestrial snake species. Only the forked tips protrude from the mouth through a divided notch {{in the middle of the}} rostral scale. The nostrils have valves consisting of a specialized spongy tissue to exclude water, and the windpipe can be drawn up to where the short nasal passage opens into the roof of the mouth. This is an important adaptation for <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> must surface to breathe, but may have its head partially submerged when doing so. The lung has become very large and extends almost the entire length of the body, although the rear portion is thought to have developed to aid buoyancy rather than to exchange gases. The extended lung possibly also serves to store air for dives.|$|E

5|$|The {{requirements}} for the priesthood differed over time and among the cults of different gods. Although detailed theological knowledge was involved in priestly offices, {{little is known about}} what knowledge or training may have been required of the officeholders. Priests were required to observe strict standards of ritual purity in the sacred space. They shaved their heads and bodies, washed several times a day, and wore only clean linen clothing. They were not required to be celibate, but sexual intercourse rendered them unclean until they underwent further purification. The cults of specific gods might impose further restrictions related to that god's mythology, such as rules against eating the meat of <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> represented the god. The acceptance of women into the priesthood was variable. In the Old Kingdom many women served as priests, but their presence in clergies declined drastically in the Middle Kingdom before increasing in the Third Intermediate Period. Lesser positions, such as that of musician in ceremonies, remained open to women in even the most restrictive periods, as did the special role of ceremonial consort of the god. This latter role was highly influential, and {{the most important of these}} consorts, the God's Wife of Amun, even supplanted the High Priest of Amun during the Late Period.|$|E
5|$|The {{transition}} from an aquatic, lobe-finned fish to an air-breathing amphibian {{was a significant}} and fundamental one in the evolutionary history of the vertebrates. For an organism {{to live in a}} gravity-neutral aqueous environment, then colonize one that requires an organism to support its entire weight and possess a mechanism to mitigate dehydration, required significant adaptations or exaptations within the overall body plan, both in form and in function. Eryops, an example of <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> made such adaptations, refined many of the traits found in its fish ancestors. Sturdy limbs supported and transported its body while out of water. A thicker, stronger backbone prevented its body from sagging under its own weight. Also, through the reshaping of vestigial fish jaw bones, a rudimentary middle ear began developing to connect to the piscine inner ear, allowing Eryops to amplify, and so better sense, airborne sound.|$|E
5|$|The Andean condor is {{considered}} near {{threatened by the}} IUCN. It was first placed on the United States Endangered Species list in 1970, a status which is assigned to <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> {{is in danger of}} extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. Threats to its population include loss of habitat needed for foraging, secondary poisoning from animals killed by hunters and persecution. It is threatened mainly in the northern area of its range, and is extremely rare in Venezuela and Colombia, where it has undergone considerable declines in recent years. Because it is adapted to very low mortality and has correspondingly low reproductive rates, it is extremely vulnerable to human persecution, most of which {{stems from the fact that}} it is perceived as a threat by farmers due to alleged attacks on livestock. Education programs have been implemented by conservationists to dispel this misconception. Reintroduction programs using captive-bred Andean condors, which release birds hatched in North American zoos into the wild to bolster populations, have been introduced in Argentina, Venezuela, and Colombia. The first captive-bred Andean condors were released into the wild in 1989. When raising condors, human contact is minimal; chicks are fed with glove puppets which resemble adult Andean condors in order to prevent the chicks from imprinting on humans, which would endanger them upon release as they would not be wary of humans. The condors are kept in aviaries for three months prior to release, where they acclimatize to an environment similar to that which they will be released in. Released condors are tracked by satellite in order to observe their movements and to monitor whether they are still alive.|$|E

25|$|Wildlife {{preservation}} was not {{a priority}} {{for the federal government}} during the 19th century due to belief in the superabundance of natural resources, the presence of a wilderness frontier, and a political climate that emphasized development and exploitation. The bison was the iconic species of the North American conservation movement, <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> symbolized frontier wilderness and the disappearing wild.

25|$|During the winter, belugas {{commonly}} become {{trapped in}} the ice {{without being able to}} escape to open water, which may be several kilometres away. Polar bears take particular advantage of these situations and are able to locate the belugas using their sense of smell. The bears swipe at the belugas and drag them onto the ice to eat them.
