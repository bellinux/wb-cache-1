5|$|A purely non-socialist, conservative-led {{cabinet of}} Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was {{appointed}} on 27 November. The nomination {{was both a}} long-term <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conservatives and a respond to the labour movements' acts during November 1917. Svinhufvud's main goals were to separate Finland from Russia, strengthen the military power of the Civil-White Guards and to return at least {{a part of the}} Parliament's new power to the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Despite the <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NCMP {{scheme to}} {{ameliorate}} {{the impacts of}} the first-past-the-post system, its legitimacy is highly doubted. It is based neither on a clear electoral mandate like ordinary MPs, nor on expertise or specialization (as {{in the case of}} NMPs). As a result, the privileges of NCMPs are severely curtailed and this limits their effectiveness as alternative voices in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Early {{decompression}} theory generally {{assumed that}} inert gas bubble {{formation in the}} tissues could be avoided during decompression, and the <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decompression tables and algorithms was to prevent bubble formation while minimising decompression time. Most dissolved phase models are perfusion limited, and differ mainly {{by the number of}} compartments, the range of half-times, and supersaturation tolerances assumed. These models are commonly referred to as Haldanean.|$|E

50|$|The plan {{set forth}} two major <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union: a {{common foreign policy}} and a common defense policy.

5|$|Early in {{the morning}} on 8 August the Georgian 4th Brigade from Vaziani Military Base {{advanced}} on the left flank of Tskhinvali; the 3rd Brigade advanced on the right flank. The <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flank operations was to advance northward after capturing key positions. The Georgian troops would take the Gupta bridge and the road to the Roki Tunnel, barring the Russian troops from moving southward.|$|E
5|$|Following the Anschluss, the {{historical}} <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German nationalists {{who supported the}} union between Austria and Germany was completed. The pan-Germanists were then fully absorbed into the Nazi Party (NSDAP).|$|E
5|$|Inglenook Sidings is {{an award-winning}} model railway train {{shunting}} puzzle created by Alan Wright for the Manchester Model Railway Society's 1978 show, {{based on the}} former Kilham Sidings on the Alnwick and Cornhill Railway.

5|$|Like most {{strategic}} bombing during World War II, the <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> USAAF {{offensive against}} Japan was {{to destroy the}} enemy's war industries, kill or disable civilian employees of these industries, and undermine civilian morale. Civilians {{who took part in}} the war effort through such activities as building fortifications and manufacturing munitions and other war materials in factories and workshops were considered combatants in a legal sense and therefore liable to be attacked.|$|E

5|$|Smoke screens have {{continued}} {{to be used by}} attackers and defenders as a means of sowing confusion and hiding movements. During naval battles in the 18–19th centuries, shots were sometimes fired early so a defensive screen was erected before the ships converged, to spoil the <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enemy.|$|E

5|$|The <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{publishing}} house was {{to publish the}} works of former Waffen-SS members, in cooperation with HIAG. The authors of the {{publishing house}} were former Waffen-SS unit commanders or staff officers, {{who were members of}} HIAG. The Munin Verlag titles did not go through the rigorous fact-checking processes common in the traditional historical literature; they were revisionist accounts unedited by professional historians and presented the former Waffen-SS members' version of events.|$|E
5|$|The <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> revolt was {{to inspire}} a wider {{uprising}} {{among the general}} populace {{in an attempt to}} overthrow the colonial regime and establish independence. The VNQDĐ had previously attempted to engage in clandestine activities to undermine French rule, but increasing French scrutiny on their activities led to their leadership group taking the risk of staging a large scale military attack in the Red River Delta in northern Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|The <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first season's depot-laying was {{to place}} a series of depots on the Barrier from its edge (Safety Camp) down to 80°S, for use on the polar journey which would begin the {{following}} spring. The final depot would be the largest, and would be known as One Ton Depot. The work was {{to be carried out}} by 12men, the 8fittest ponies, and two dog teams; ice conditions prevented the use of the motor sledges.|$|E
