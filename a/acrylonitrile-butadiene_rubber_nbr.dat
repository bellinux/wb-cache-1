40|$|The {{synthesis}} of <b>acrylonitrile-butadiene</b> <b>rubbers</b> (<b>NBRs)</b> via trithiocarbonate-mediated reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of acrylonitrile (ACN) and 1, 3 -butadiene (BD) in solution under azeotropic conditions (38 / 62) was investigated {{for a broad}} range of common solvents: N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), chlorobenzene, 1, 4 -dioxane, tert-butanol, isobutyronitrile, toluene, trimethylacetonitrile, dimethyl carbonate, acetonitrile, methyl acetate, acetone, and tert-butyl methyl ether. The gravimetrically determined conversions for the free radical polymerizations of ACN/BD after 22 h at 100 °C were in the range of 15 % for methyl acetate to 35 % for DMAc. The origin of the differences in conversion is attributed to the unequal decomposition behavior of the employed azo initiator 2, 2 ′-azobis(N-butyl- 2 -methylpropionamide) (1) in the solvents under investigation, as determined by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy. Relative decomposition of 1 in solution (0. 1 mol L- 1) at 100 °C was calculated from the UV-vis spectra for selected solvents. 90 % of 1 in DMAc was decomposed after 22 h, 83 % in tert-butanol, 57 % in 1, 4 -dioxane, 53 % in isobutyronitrile, 45 % in chlorobenzene, and 21 % in toluene. The evolution of molecular weight with conversion using the initiator 1 was in accordance with the theoretically expected values, regardless of the solvent studied. Moreover, the RAFT-mediated copolymerization of ACN/BD in DMAc with azo initiators 1, 1 -[(1 -cyano- 1 -methylethyl) azo]formamide (2) and 1, 1 ′- azobis(cyclohexanecarbonitrile) (3) was investigated. A strong deviation from the linear evolution of molecular weight due to a fast decomposition of these initiators - congruent with high primary radical delivery rates - at the selected temperature was observed when using 2 and 3.

In addition, we tested a layered material composed of a non-woven polyester (PES), a polypropylene (PP) film, and a non-woven PP used for protective coats (code D). The cytostatics were analyzed by liquid chromatography with diode array detection. The tested samples were placed in a purpose-built permeation cell modified to be different from that specified in the standard EN 6529 : 2001. Results The tested materials were characterized by good resistance to solutions containing 2 out of the 3 selected cytostatics: doxorubicin and 5 -fluorouracil, as indicated by a breakthrough time of over 480 min. Equally high resistance to permeation of the third cytostatic (docetaxel) was exhibited by natural <b>rubber</b> latex, <b>acrylonitrile-butadiene</b> <b>rubber,</b> and chloroprene rubber.

It was found that 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium thiocyanate (EMImSCN) and 1 -methyl- 3 -octylimidazolium chloride (OMImCl) improved the ionic conductivity of NBR composites. Moreover, both ionic liquids strongly influenced the rheometric data and mechanical properties (static and dynamic). NBR - based composites displayed elastomeric properties and high tensile strength up to 19 MPa when 10 phr EMImSCN was added.

For non-functionalized MWNTs, Eb is almost directly proportional to Rg under equivalent parameters. Moreover, it is observed that functional groups hinder the wrapping of NBR chains on the MWNT surfaces.

In the PVC/NBR/SBR (50 / 10 / 40) blends, the tensile strength and elongation-at-break increased with an increase in sulfur concentration. This improvement was attributed to covulcanization between NBR and SBR. The fracture toughness of PVC/NBR/SBR (50 / 10 / 40) blends was characterized by the critical strain energy release rate, G(C). In the case of the PVC/NBR- 29 /SBR (50 / 10 / 40) blends, an increase in sulfur concentration resulted in a dramatic increase in G(C).

A master curve was created by shifting the relaxation curves vertically and horizontally towards the reference curve. The vertical shift factor bT is a function of the temperature dependence of the athermal stress components. It was found that the oil distribution strongly affects the athermal stress component which is related to the contribution of the structural changes, e. g. crystallinity of the PP phase and the average molecular weight between the crosslinks of the NBR phase.

The short T- 1 rho(H) component {{may be interpreted}} as {{the contribution of the}} rubbers in the PVC/rubbers interface. The long T- 1 rho(H) component is attributed to the rubbers isolated from PVC. As sulfur concentration increases, the long T- 1 rho(H) decreases due to increasing restraints imposed on the rubber chains by crosslinking, but the fraction of rubbers with short T- 1 rho(H) increases, indicating that the rubber fraction at the interface increases. The TEM micrographs of stained and unstained samples show identical morphological information. For the unstained samples, the PVC and SBR regions appear as dark and light areas, respectively. The dehydrochlorination of PVC in the blends under an electron beam reduces the contrast between the dark and light areas, producing an inversion of contrast. However, when the blends are compatibilized by NBR, the deterioration rate of the contrast slows down significantly. As the dark PVC regions become lighter, dark boundaries are visible between the PVC and SBR phases. In particular, the dark boundaries remain visible upon extended exposures of electron beam irradiation. This is explained by the stabilizing effect of the higher rubber concentration in the interfacial regions between PVC and SBR. The TEM micrographs of the unstained samples for this system provide a unique method to show the segregation of rubbers at the interfacial regions between PVC and SBR for the compatibilized blends.

40|$|I {{report the}} {{development}} of a nanoimprint-lithography-based method of fabricating a wire grid polarizer (WGP), which greatly relaxes patterning and etching requirements and can be easily applied to produce flexible WGPs. Nanoimprinting is a simple and cheap large-area nanofabrication process. To date, WGPs were fabricated by electron beam lithography. Although electron beam lithography has a high resolution and good profile, it is slow and expensive. Therefore, electron beam lithography is not suitable for large-area nanofabrication. To fabricate larger WGPs, nanoimprinting lithography {{is one of the best}} processes. WGP resolution and material brittleness have somewhat limited the choice of previous resists used for nanoimprinting. Hence, I developed an epoxy resist whose physical properties were tuned by adjusting the ratio of bisphenol F-type to <b>acrylonitrile-butadiene</b> <b>rubber</b> (<b>NBR)</b> -based epoxy resins in the resist formulation. The mechanical properties of the resist were tuned to obtain various aspect ratios and mold flexibility for conformal contact over nonplanar surfaces and large areas. Roll-to-roll nanoimprint lithography is a very attractive method of manufacturing micro- and nanopatterns owing to its large-area patterning capabilities. Material flexibility is one of the most important requirements in roll-to-roll nanoimprint lithography. Commercially available bisphenol F-type epoxy resin is much less expensive than other resins, so it is a widely used construction polymer. NBR rubber is also widely used. Hence, the resist formulation I developed could be used to industrially mass-produce nanostructures. In addition, I used atomic layer deposition to fabricate 20 -nm-linewidth, 9 : 1 -aspect-ratio ultrasmall nanostructures. I used nanoimprint lithography to pattern a high-aspect-ratio, narrow-linewidth grating and subsequently deposited two aluminum layers angled in opposite directions to efficiently fabricate the large-area WGP. Anisotropic reactive-ion etching was used to remove the aluminum layer deposited on top of the grating while retaining that on the grating sidewalls, thereby forming a metal wire grid whose spacings were much smaller than those of a lithographically defined grating. The WGP showed good optical properties in the visible range. I encapsulated the WGP in a thin layer of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) for practical use, and the encapsulated WGP worked well in the visible range...|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{solution is}} to use metal pipes to transfer water but these are costly to deliver and assemble. Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) covered hoses and Nitrile <b>rubber</b> (<b>NBR)</b> covered hoses {{have a lot of}} advantages compared to metal pipes. It is easy to deliver, assemble and disassemble hoses and long sections of NBR- and TPU-covered hoses reduce the possibility of leakage in connecting parts. These large-diameter NBR- and TPU-covered hoses are called fracking hoses.|$|R
50|$|The {{drum shell}} (or pulley face) can be {{produced}} in aluminium, steel or stainless steel and is normally crowned to facilitate central belt tracking. However, cylindrical shells {{can be produced}} and fitted with external sprockets or rotary brushes for special applications. <b>Rubber</b> <b>NBR,</b> PU and other coatings {{can be applied to}} the shell to increase friction between the shell and conveyor belt and hot vulcanised or moulded profiled lagging can also be applied to drive plastic or steel modular belts.|$|R
50|$|An {{improved}} {{version of}} nitrile butadiene <b>rubber</b> (<b>NBR)</b> is carboxylated nitrile butadiene rubber (XNBR).In this execution there are beside the sulfur bridges also carboxyl groups R-COO- on the double bond of the butadiene part. These groups will make ionic cross links with zinc (Zn2+) to give improved physical properties {{as compared to}} a non-carboxylated nitrile rubber. These ionic crosslinks are formed along with sulfur links. The carboxyl groups which are needed for these extra links are distributed randomly and are present at levels of 10% or less.|$|R
