5|$|The group {{recorded}} with Finn {{over a period}} of three months at numerous locations in their hometown of San Diego <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles.</b> Finn was key in producing the fast-paced, melodic mixes, creating pop punk with a more radio-friendly, accessible polish. Lyrically, the album is inspired by adolescent frustration and relationships. Guitarist Tom DeLonge and bassist Mark Hoppus primarily culled stories from friends and autobiographical situations to craft summery tracks revolving around breakups, suburban parties and maturity, as well as more offbeat subject matter such as UFO conspiracy theories. The cover artwork for Enema of the State features porn star Janine Lindemulder famously clad in a nurse uniform, and the title is a pun on the term enemy of the state.|$|E
5|$|Kane {{opened at}} the RKO Palace Theatre on Broadway in New York on May 1, 1941, in Chicago on May 6, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> on May 8. Welles said that at the Chicago premiere that he {{attended}} the theater was almost empty. It did well in cities and larger towns but fared poorly in more remote areas. RKO still had problems getting exhibitors to show the film. For example, one chain controlling more than 500 theaters got Welles's film {{as part of a}} package but refused to play it, reportedly out of fear of Hearst. Hearst's disruption of the film's release damaged its box office performance and, as a result, it lost $160,000 during its initial run. The film earned $23,878 during its first week in New York. By the ninth week it only made $7,279. Overall it lost money in New York, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., but made a profit in Seattle.|$|E
5|$|The Amps toured {{throughout}} 1995 and 1996. Early performances, before releasing Pacer, included June 1995 {{shows in}} Dayton: one with Poster Children and another with Guided by Voices.

The Amps performed a series of US concerts in October and November with Sonic Youth, including shows in Detroit and Chicago with Helium, in Seattle and Portland with Bikini Kill, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> with Mike Watt. Following the concerts with Sonic Youth, the Amps did a tour of Europe. In January 1996, they played the Summersault festival in Australia. That year, the Amps toured with the Foo Fighters in the United States, in locations such as Chicago (with That Dog), Worcester, Massachusetts, and Austin, Texas (with Jawbreaker). In 1995 or 1996, they also played shows with the Tasties and Brainiac.|$|E

500|$|On January 14, 2009, CW green-lit a {{back-door}} {{pilot for}} an untitled spin-off series starring a young Lily van der Woodsen. The concept {{was based on}} an original idea by Gossip Girl producers Schwartz and Savage. The pilot episode, eventually named [...] "Valley Girls", was written by Stephanie Savage and Josh Schwartz and directed by Mark Piznarski, all of whom had previously worked the same roles for the Gossip Girl pilot. [...] "Valley Girls" [...] was shot on location in New York City, New York <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles,</b> California beginning in February 2009. Flashbacks were set apart from present day scenes through a grainy, sepia tone. A scene in which Lily conceives and carries out an [...] "elaborate plan to kiss a boy, and then lie about it" [...] in order to violate her school's honor code and be expelled, was cut from the final episode. [...] "Valley Girls" [...] aired on May 11, 2009.|$|E
500|$|While Roberts {{sought to}} begin work on a second album, they began to tour with fellow Welsh band The Manic Street Preachers as a support act, and the label {{released}} the compilation Tourist EP in Japan.

They booked in a recording session for the second album in June, at the Monnow Valley Studio in Rockfield, Monmouthshire. In the run up to the recording, they performed {{for the first time in}} the United States, supporting The Boo Radleys in New York. They went on to perform in Austin, Texas <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> during March.

500|$|... "Valley Girls" [...] is the twenty-fourth {{episode of}} the second season of The CW {{television}} series Gossip Girl. The episode served as a backdoor pilot for a potential Gossip Girl spin-off series set in the 1980s, entitled Valley Girls. The episode was directed by Mark Piznarski and written by Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage (this was the first {{episode of the}} series since [...] "Much 'I Do' About Nothing" [...] to be co-written by Schwartz). It was filmed on location in New York City, New York <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles,</b> California. References to elements of 1980s popular culture were heavily accentuated in the episode, which the producers hoped would bridge the generation gap between the characters and audience. [...] "Valley Girls" [...] aired on the CW in the United States on May 11, 2009 and was viewed live by an audience of 2.31 million Americans. Although the episode received generally positive reviews, the spin-off series was not picked up.|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} and release of Neighborhoods was delayed multiple times. The recording's delay {{was due to}} the way the band chose to work — in bits and pieces, alone and together, in a pair of California studios — in addition to each member's busy schedules. The album was recorded at both DeLonge's studio in San Diego <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> by Hoppus and Barker. [...] Recording in separate studios was DeLonge's idea, and ideas were exchanged via e-mail. Various engineers met up in person to trade files on hard drives. Although the three musicians were rarely in the same room while recording, opting to work on their parts individually, DeLonge asserted that the method of recording was a more efficient way of working considering the schedules, not {{due to a lack of}} unity within the band. In addition, Barker was releasing a solo record, DeLonge was involved in Angels & Airwaves, and Hoppus had to fly to New York City once a week to film his television show, Hoppus on Music. The record was the band's first to be self-produced, due to the death of long-time producer Jerry Finn in 2008. Not only did Finn helm their last three studio albums, but he served as an invaluable member of the band: part adviser, part impartial observer, he helped smooth out tensions and hone their sound. [...] "I honestly still feel like he’s in the studio with us, because for me, personally, everything that was about {{recording and}} being in a studio, I learned from Jerry," [...] said Hoppus. Instead of a producer, each band member had their own dedicated sound engineer. DeLonge, who was against using a producer after self-producing most of his Angels & Airwaves records, described the band situation as [...] "very democratic," [...] noting that he learned during the recording process to [...] "let go and be okay with not being able to control everything." ...|$|E

2500|$|Juvenile law in Chicago also {{recognized}} {{children who were}} without legal guardians and who should be dependent on the state. By 1906, there were juvenile courts in twenty-five states. These courts were praised by contemporaries, like Mrs. John Dickinson Sherman, who wrote in 1906 of {{the establishment of the}} juvenile courts, [...] "If the whole club movement of the six states {{in the last ten years}} had accomplished nothing else it would still be well worth while." [...] Woman's clubs helped pass Juvenile court laws in Ohio, Missouri, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles.</b>|$|E
