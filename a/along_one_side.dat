5|$|The ground {{currently}} has a seated stand <b>along</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of the pitch, which {{was constructed in}} 1992, three covered terraces and {{a small amount of}} uncovered terracing. In 1998 the ground was flooded when a nearby reservoir overflowed and the river which runs alongside the ground burst its banks.|$|E
5|$|Previously, {{the club}} {{played at the}} Walled Meadow, near to the town centre. The ground had a main wooden stand <b>along</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> (which {{incorporated}} the changing rooms), and a bank of covered terracing on the opposite side. The ground was mainly accessed via the car park off London Road, with turnstiles also situated on Eastfield Road behind the main stand. Since the club left the Walled Meadow in 1989, the ground has been demolished and the site is now used for a housing development of the same name.|$|E
5|$|At {{the front}} of the house, on the ground floor, is a reconstructed medieval shop front, from where the owner would have {{conducted}} his mercantile business. Behind this is the central hall, originally designed with an open hearth in the middle, but now fitted with a 14th-century Flemish chimney, plastered so as to resemble brickwork. A hallway runs <b>along</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of the hall; hallways were a traditional feature of the period, although the fashion was eventually abandoned because of the difficulty of lighting them effectively. At the rear of the property is an inner private room, with a decorative ceiling. Beneath the house is an undercroft, or cellar, designed to store barrels of wine at a constant temperature; the brick floor is 18th-century in origin, however. This is an architectural feature found in several other English coastal and river medieval towns, including Winchester and London.|$|E

5|$|Ibrox Park, as it {{was known}} between 1899 and 1997, is almost {{completely}} different from the Ibrox Stadium of today. It followed the model of most Scottish stadiums of the time, comprising an oval track around the pitch, with a pavilion and one stand <b>along</b> <b>one</b> <b>side.</b> The ground had a capacity of 40,000. Celtic Park, Ibrox and Hampden Park all competed {{with each other to}} host Scottish Cup Finals and Scotland matches, one of which could generate up to £1,000 in revenue for the host club. To aid their chances of gaining that revenue, Rangers constructed a large terracing, holding 36,000 people, behind the western goalmouth. The terracing, designed by Archibald Leitch, was formed by wooden planks bolted onto a framework made of iron. A similar wooden terracing was constructed at the eastern end, giving a total capacity of 75,000.|$|E
5|$|Troop sleepers, {{generally}} {{intended for}} use by enlisted personnel, were equipped with bunks stacked 3-high, and slept 29 servicemen plus the Pullman porter. Every passenger was provided with a separate Pullman bed, complete with sheets and pillowcases that were changed daily. The berths were {{laid out in a}} cross-wise arrangement that placed the aisle <b>along</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of the car, as opposed to down the center. Though the upper berths were fixed, the middle and lower sections could be reconfigured into seating during the daytime. Weapon racks were provided for each group of berths. Four washstands (two mounted {{at each end of the}} car) delivered hot and cold running water. The cars also came outfitted with two enclosed toilets and a drinking water cooler.|$|E
5|$|Occurring {{in spring}} (August to October), {{the bright red}} or orange-red inflorescences are {{terminal}} and well displayed, and consist of anywhere from 10 to 52 individual flowers split into smaller groups of 2 to 20 flowers, arranged in a corymb. The flowers sit atop stalks (known as pedicels) up to 3.5cm (1.6in) in length, which arise in pairs off main horizontal stalks within the inflorescence. Each flower consists of a tubular perianth up to 4cm (1.8in) long, which partly splits <b>along</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> at anthesis to release the thick style. The stigma is contained within a slanting disc-like structure {{at the tip of}} the style. The tubular perianth splits into four segments at its tip, and the anther lies in the concave parts within each of these segments. The pedicel and the outer surface of the perianth are pubescent (covered in short fine fur). Flowers are followed by woody rectangular seed pods that sit on long stalks, and are 7–10cm (2.8–4in) long. Each pod contains 8 to 10seeds, and is ripe in February and March. Each seed is separated from the others by a membranous separator, and has a long rectangular wing, which is much longer than the seed itself. The seedlings have obovate cotyledons that are 0.8–1cm (0.3–0.4in) wide by 1cm (0.4in) long.|$|E

50|$|Galant reflex, or truncal incurvation reflex, is {{a newborn}} reflex, named after {{neurologist}} Johann Susmann Galant. It is elicited by holding the newborn in ventral suspension (face down) and stroking <b>along</b> the <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of the spine.

Built with brick and Portland stone {{dressings}} and arch-panelled ridge and gable stacks and slate cross-gabled roofs. It is near symmetrical, rectangular in plan with a central range with towers, flanking cross range drill halls with porches and side ranges and end cross ranges, with 3 single-storey ranges along the front.|$|E
25|$|After {{arranging}} the yerba <b>along</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of the gourd, the mate is carefully tilted back onto its base, minimizing further disturbances of the yerba {{as it is}} re-oriented to allow consumption. Some settling is normal, but is not desirable. The angled mound of yerba should remain, with its powdery peak still flat and mostly level with {{the top of the}} gourd. A layer of stems along its slope will slide downward and accumulate in the space opposite the yerba (though at least a portion should remain in place).|$|E
25|$|Once the yerba mate has settled, {{the mate}} is {{carefully}} {{brought to a}} near-sideways angle, with the opening tilted just slightly upward of the base. The mate is then shaken very gently with a side-to-side motion. This further settles the yerba mate inside the gourd so that the finest particles move toward the opening and the yerba is layered <b>along</b> <b>one</b> <b>side.</b> The largest stems and other bits create a partition between the empty space {{on one side of}} the gourd and the lopsided pile of yerba on the other.|$|E
40|$|A new {{and useful}} {{apparatus}} for producing cell electrofusion is provided. The apparatus comprises: a chamber with a substrate disposed therein, means for directing the cells {{to be fused}} towards <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of the substrate in so that the cells in the fluid medium are retained against the <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of the substrate with {{a significant portion of}} the cells in cell-to-cell contact with each other <b>along</b> said <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of the substrate, and a device for inducing fusion of the portion of the cells in cell-to-cell contact with each other along the predetermined portion of the <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of the substrate...|$|R
50|$|Generally, {{combined}} contacts {{may be used}} {{to avoid}} jerk (and also wear and noise) associated with one single follower, e.g. gliding along a slot and thereby changing its contact point from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of the slot to the other, by using two followers always sliding <b>along</b> the same, <b>one</b> <b>side</b> each.|$|R

Visiting supporters are housed in the open air Silkman End (named after a public house which formerly adjoined the terrace) and part of the McAlpine Stand.|$|E
25|$|Carleton University, {{founded in}} 1942, is located south of {{downtown}} on a verdant campus stretched between the Rideau Canal and Rideau River. It is itself {{home to one}} of Canada's premier schools of architecture. The design of Carleton's campus and buildings deliberately rejected monumentalism, focusing instead on the academic quadrangle, aiming to present an egalitarian rather than elite sensibility. The University's current building projects include a new River Building adjacent to the Rideau River, which was completed in 2011. The tallest academic building in Ottawa is Carleton's Dunton Tower; completed in 1971, the international style building sits <b>along</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of the quadrangle and is Carleton's most visible architectural landmark.|$|E
25|$|In most {{reptiles}} the perilymphatic duct and lagena {{are relatively}} short, and the sensory cells {{are confined to}} a small basilar papilla lying between them. However, in birds, mammals, and crocodilians, these structures become much larger and somewhat more complicated. In birds, crocodilians, and monotremes, the ducts are simply extended, together forming an elongated, more or less straight, tube. The endolymphatic duct is wrapped in a simple loop around the lagena, with the basilar membrane lying <b>along</b> <b>one</b> <b>side.</b> The {{first half of the}} duct is now referred to as the scala vestibuli, while the second half, which includes the basilar membrane, is called the scala tympani. As a result of this increase in length, the basilar membrane and papilla are both extended, with the latter developing into the organ of Corti, while the lagena is now called the cochlear duct. All of these structures together constitute the cochlea.|$|E

25|$|Various neuropsychological {{research}} studies {{have considered the}} role of frame of reference in hemispatial neglect, offering new evidence to support both allocentric and egocentric neglect. To begin, one study conducted by Dongyun Li, Hans-Otto Karnath, and Christopher Rorden examined whether allocentric neglect varies with egocentric position. This experimental design consisted of testing eleven right hemispheric stroke patients. Five of these patients showed spatial neglect on their contralesional side, while the remaining six patients showed no spatial neglect. During the study, the patients were presented with two arrays of seven triangles. The first array ran from southwest to northeast (SW-NE) and the second array ran from southeast to northwest (SE-NW). In {{a portion of the}} experimental trials, the middle triangle in the array contained a gap <b>along</b> <b>one</b> <b>side.</b> Participants were tested on their ability to perceive the presence of this gap, and were instructed to press one response button if the gap was present and a second response button if the gap was absent.|$|E
25|$|Each ship could {{accommodate}} {{a maximum of}} sixty-four lifeboats. However, only 20 boats were installed on Olympic and Titanic during construction to avoid cluttering the deck and provide more space for passengers. Shipbuilders of the era envisaged the ocean liner itself as the ultimate lifeboat and therefore imagined that a lifeboat's purpose {{was that of a}} ferry between a foundering liner and a rescue ship. Despite the low number of lifeboats, both Olympic and Titanic exceeded Board of Trade regulations of the time. Following the sinking of Titanic, more lifeboats were added to Olympic (some lifeboats might even have been from the foundered Titanic). Britannic, meanwhile, was equipped with seven huge gantry davits, five along the Boat Deck and two on the Poop Deck at the stern. Each contained six lifeboats and were individually powered by electric motors with their own night time illumination. In the event that the ship should develop a list and make the lowering of lifeboats impossible <b>along</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> the davits could be maneuvered to pick up lifeboats {{from the other side of}} the deck.|$|E
25|$|The {{voice coil}} itself is shaped rather like an arrowhead, {{and made of}} doubly coated copper magnet wire. The inner layer is insulation, and the outer is thermoplastic, which bonds the coil {{together}} after it is wound on a form, making it self-supporting. The portions of the coil along {{the two sides of}} the arrowhead (which point to the actuator bearing center) then interact with the magnetic field of the fixed magnet. Current flowing radially outward <b>along</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of the arrowhead and radially inward on the other produces the tangential force. If the magnetic field were uniform, each side would generate opposing forces that would cancel each other out. Therefore, the surface of the magnet is half north pole and half south pole, with the radial dividing line in the middle, causing {{the two sides of the}} coil to see opposite magnetic fields and produce forces that add instead of canceling. Currents along the top and bottom of the coil produce radial forces that do not rotate the head.|$|E
