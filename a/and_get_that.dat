And I'd sing them the chorus and the melody—no lyrics or anything—and {{straight}} away five pencils and pads came out and they were throwing lines at us. Ten minutes later the song was written. Then you go through and refine it. Then later, as you were recording it you might change a few thing here and there. But pretty much {{it was a real}} quick process. They were confident in what they were doing, throwing it out there.|$|E
5|$|After graduating, Shelley {{worked in}} Seremban in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia, until May 1965. He then {{returned}} to Singapore and began working for a company manufacturing pipes, subsequently starting his own machinery-importing business. He also served on the Public Service Commission (PSC) for over three decades, from 1976 to 2007. The PSC is a body created by the Constitution of Singapore that appoints, promotes, dismisses and exercises disciplinary control over public officers in Singapore. It has additional responsibility for planning and administering scholarships provided by the Government of Singapore. Shelley was involved in interviewing civil servants as well as students seeking scholarships; {{he wrote a book}} entitled How to Interview Well <b>and</b> <b>Get</b> <b>that</b> Job! (2004). For service to the people of Singapore, the Government conferred the Bintang Bakti Masyarakat (Public Service Star) on him in 1978, awarding an additional Bar the following year.|$|E
25|$|The same {{situation}} is in evidence in everyday life, however, whenever attention is fixated {{with a question}} or an experience of the amazing, the unusual, or anything that holds a person's interest. At such moments people experience the common everyday trance; they tend to gaze {{off to the right}} or left, depending upon which cerebral hemisphere is most dominant (Baleen, 1969) <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> faraway or blank look. Their eyes may actually close, their bodies tend to become immobile (a form of catalepsy), certain reflexes (e.g., swallowing, respiration, etc.) may be suppressed, and they seem momentarily oblivious to their surroundings until they have completed their inner search on the unconscious level for the new idea, response, or frames of reference that will restabilize their general reality orientation. We hypothesize that in everyday life consciousness is in a continual state of flux between the general reality orientation and the momentary microdynamics of trance...|$|E

500|$|Coming off a shellacking against Ohio State, Penn State {{looked to}} rebound behind a strong {{defensive}} effort against Illinois. Linebacker Mike Hull noted, [...] "Practice Monday and (Tuesday) was real energetic {{and we were}} smacking people out there. We’re ready to play another game on Saturday <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> taste of losing out of our mouth." [...] Keys to the game included moving on from the prior Saturday's defeat, limiting big plays on defense, containing Illinois quarterback Nathan Scheelhaase, and protecting quarterback Christian Hackenberg. A pre-game analysis of statistical comparisons between the two squads gave Penn State an advantage in most offensive and defensive stats, while it gave Illinois an advantage on special teams. The analyst blamed sanctions imposed by NCAA president Mark Emmert in wake of the Penn State child sex abuse scandal for that disparity, citing scholarship reductions hampering depth.|$|E
500|$|North Korean anti {{aircraft}} fire struck Sebille's P-51 as {{he turned}} to make a second run, heavily damaging the aircraft and it began trailing smoke and glycol coolant. Sebille had intended to release his second bomb, but he radioed Johnson that he had been hit and injured, probably fatally. Johnson radioed back Sebille should try to head for a US emergency landing strip in Taegu a short distance away, but Sebille responded with his last known words, [...] "No, I'll never make it. I'm going back <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> bastard (sic)". He dove straight toward the APC that was his target. He fired his six rockets in salvo, but instead of pulling up to the regular , he deliberately continued to dive his airplane and the remaining bomb straight into the target, firing his six machine guns. His plane sustained even heavier damage, and he crashed into the North Korean convoy destroying a large contingent of North Korean ground troops and vehicles though being killed instantly himself.|$|E

Although it was very cold, the director {{said that it was}} still [...] "great to actually be in the city <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> authentic New York flavor." [...] Most of the film was done on real location as well. Interior scenes which took place at Marcus' workplace were shot in the old Univision building that had been repainted for production. The scene in Lady Eloise's bedroom was shot at the Park Plaza Hotel, in a suite personally redesigned by Ivana Trump, which accounts for the unique styling.|$|E

Quinn responded, saying, [...] "I apologize to anyone, obviously, who is a Notre Dame alum, or for those fans who thought I wasn't being very business like. I was there for awhile, and at that moment in time, when you finally get picked after waiting for 4 1/2 hours, the last thought in my head was spit out your gum, fix your hair or make sure your shirt and everything looked good.

2500|$|His {{wife was}} always rolling around in pain, and X̱i7lánexw {{says to the}} men, whom he called his grandchildren, [...] "I don't know {{what is wrong with}} my wife grandchildren. The lead man knew what was wrong, for he was the great Transformer. He knows she {{is going to have a}} baby. He tells his two other brothers, [...] "You fellows go across <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> tree bark, those green trees over there." [...] He scraped off the bark and then asked X̱i7lánexw [...] if he had a bowl plate and told him to put three rocks in to boil the water. They took the bark of the willow tree, then gave it to the woman to drink. The lead brother told his younger brothers, [...] "You better take your {{grandfather}} outside", which they did while the oldest brother stayed with X̱i7lánexw 's wife. Not long after, they heard a baby's cry. He fixed the baby up and taught the woman how to take care of it, and told him about the medicine. He told the man that when he came him, that he had a baby boy. The first baby was a boy, and the next a girl. These two grew up together and married each other. The next baby was a girl, then a boy, and these did the same. This is where all the Sḵwx̱wú7mesh came from.|$|E
2500|$|The {{group were}} {{supposed}} to meet with producer Eliot Kennedy the week after they left their former managers, but the meeting was arranged by the Herberts weeks before their departure. But without access to Herbert's address book, they knew nothing of Kennedy's whereabouts other than he lived in Sheffield. Brown and Halliwell drove to Sheffield {{the day after the}} departure from Heart Management and looked for the first phone book they came across; Eliot was the third Kennedy that they called. That evening they went to his house and persuaded him to work with them. The rest of the girls travelled to Sheffield the next day. Kennedy commented about the session: [...] "None of them played instruments, so I was left to do the music <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> vibe together. What I said to them was, 'Look, I've got a chorus—check this out'. Then they were throwing lines at us. 10 minutes later the song was written. Then you go through and refine it. Then later, as you were recording it you might change a few thing here and there. But pretty much it was a real quick process." [...] Two tracks of the album were composed in that session: [...] "Love Thing" [...] and [...] "Say You'll Be There". In the following months the group continued to meet with producers, wrote new songs, prepared demos and searched for a new manager. They met again with the writers Stannard and Rowe. They had previously worked with the girls in January 1995 before their departure from Heart Management; that was the group's first professional songwriting session, held at the Strongroom in Curtain Road, east London.|$|E
2500|$|Cole has cited several hip-hop {{artists as}} {{influencing}} his rapping style, including Tupac Shakur, Nas, Jay Z, and Eminem.

That's how you supposed to do it. You're supposed to learn and take pieces from the greatest. So, Jay was my mentor before I ever signed to him.

Before I even thought of-It went from Michael Jackson, Bobby Brown as a kid and artists like that. Even Kool Moe Dee. Just the cool dude that I looked up to. And then one day my stepfather came home from-I don't know if he was back from Desert Storm...I remember him coming home with that first Pac album. With [...] "Brenda's Got A Baby". It was 2Pacalypse Now. And since then-When I was too young to know what he was talking about, but it connected. Cause that's the thing about art. It's just truth. It's straight-Whatever you feel. So, even as a seven-year-old kid, eight-year-old kid I could hear Pac's early albums and feel the truth." [...] Cole drew comparisons to Nas following the release of Friday Night Lights, stating that Nas served as the primary inspiration behind the creation of the mixtape. Cole later addressed their musical similarities on [...] "Let Nas Down", a song written and composed due to his disparaging comments towards [...] "Work Out".|$|E

2500|$|With Monroe and Lester Flatt, Scruggs {{performed}} on the Grand Ole Opry and in September 1946 recorded the classic hit [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky"; a song that was designated by the Library of Congress {{to be added to}} the National Recording Registry, and later added to the Grammy Hall of Fame. The work schedule was heavy in Monroe's band. They were playing a lot of jobs in movie theaters all over the south, riding in a 1941 Chevrolet from town to town, doing up to six shows a day and not finishing up until about eleven at night. Lester Flatt said, [...] "It wasn't anything to ride two or three days in a car. We didn't have buses like we do now, and we never had our shoes off". The self-imposed rule was to always get back in time to play the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville each Saturday night. Scruggs said of Monroe that [...] "Bill would never let the music go down no matter how tired we were. If a man would slack off, he would move over <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> mandolin up close on him and get him back up there". Despite the group's success, Scruggs decided the demands were too great. He was single at the time, and the brief few hours on Saturdays that he made it home, it was just to pack his suitcase at the Tulane Hotel where he lived alone, then repeat the cycle—he had done this for two years. He turned in his resignation, planning to go take care of his mother in North Carolina. [...] Flatt had also made up his mind to leave but he had not told anyone. He later gave his two-week notice but, before the notice was up, the bass player Howard Watts announced that he was leaving too. [...] Despite Monroe's pleading, they left the band. Monroe thought Flatt and Scruggs had a secret understanding, but both men denied it. Monroe did not speak to either one for 20 years thereafter, a feud well known in country music circles.|$|E
