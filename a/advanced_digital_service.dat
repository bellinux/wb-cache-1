40|$|In the {{information}} technology era, there are relentless needs for networks with extremely high capacity. Due to the increasing internet usage and upsurge in users, the end users were longing for the revolution in the network. At this juncture to make the dreams of the network users come true, tremendous research has resulted in opticaltechnology {{which is a great}} boon to the world of communication. Optical Packet Switching (OPS) presents new avenues for high speed interconnection networks. There is a rapidly growing demand for high-throughput networks to transmit heterogeneous traffic services such as communication of voice, images and data, multimedia interaction and <b>advanced</b> <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> which warranted OPS. These heterogeneous traffic services in OPS networks require appropriate treatments (e. g. delay or bandwidth guarantees). Quality of Service (QoS) is the only way through which optimization can be attained in the OPS. OPS networks place a particular attention to the QoS provisioning problem from end-to-end perspective. QoS provisioning is therefore a mandatory task in optical packet switching networks. The goal of QoS is to provide guarantees on the ability of a network to deliver predictable results. A network monitoring system must typically be deployed as part of QoS, to insure that networks are performing at the desired level. Definitely, optical networks with improved QoS capabilities are the main goal for the next generation telecommunication infrastructure. One of the proper ways of improving QoS is enhancing the network parameters in each layer. The major parameters that affect the performance of QoS in OPS are: (1) Bit Error Rate (BER), (2) Packet Loss Rate (PLR), (3) Bandwidth, (4) Delay, (5) Jitter, (6) Recovery time, (7) Response time, (8) Reliability, (9) Availability, (10) Fault tolerance and (11) Throughput and so on...|$|E

40|$|A large {{percentage}} of scientific data with tabular structure are published on the Web of Data as interlinked RDF datasets. When {{we come to the}} issue of long-term preservation of such RDF-based digital objects, it is important to provide full support for reusing them in the future. In particular, it should include means for both players who have no familiarity with RDF data model and, at the same time, who by working only with the native format of the data still provide sufficient information. To achieve this, we need mechanisms to bring the data back to their original format and structure. In this paper, we investigate how to perform the reverse process for column-based data sources. In particular, we devise an algorithm, RML 2 CSV, and exemplify its implementation in transforming an RDF dataset into its CSV tabular structure, through the use of the same RML mapping document that was used to generate the set of RDF triples. Through a set of content-based criteria, we attempt a comparative evaluation to measure the similarity between the rebuilt CSV and the original one. The results are promising and show that, under certain assumptions, RML 2 CSV reconstructs the same data with the same structure, offering more <b>advanced</b> <b>digital</b> preservation <b>services...</b>|$|R

40|$|As <b>digital</b> <b>services</b> {{increasingly}} {{deal with}} commodity offerings (i. e., digital content and {{features that are}} similar between service providers), service providers are seeking to differentiate themselves with variations in their <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> business models. Research, though, has yet to consider the association of consumer perceived value with <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> business models underlying technological innovations. We seek to demonstrate that consumer value for <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> business models may be quite different even when consumers have similar preferences for standard technology characteristics. In {{the context of this}} paper, we specifically consider consumer perceived value associated with Personal Health Records (PHRs) and PHR digital business models, through the use of an integrated latent variable and choice empirical model. We find that although consumer perceived value for PHRs is generally high, when offered a choice between three competing PHR business models, consumers state high value for only two of the business models in the choice set: PHRs offered directly by groups of medical providers and Integrated PHRs. These findings suggest that while perceived value may be high for generally considered <b>digital</b> <b>services,</b> variations in the underlying <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> business models are likely to have significant impacts on consumer valuations of <b>digital</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R
