[...] Corbyn said [...] "I have no support for ISIS whatsoever, and obviously that should apply to someone who has committed crimes, but we should bear in mind that expressing a political point of view is not in itself an offence".

2500|$|The {{narrative}} focus then {{covers the}} trip from Humulești to the Moldavian capital: Creangă and Gâtlan are passengers in the horse-drawn wagon of Luca, their neighbor and family friend. The narrator recounts sense of his shame and frustration upon noticing that Luca's [...] "steeds" [...] are actually [...] "weak and scraggy" [...] horses, and the despondency which grips him and Zaharia {{in front of the}} unknown. This sentiment is enhanced by the remarks of passers-by, which refer to the poor state of Luca's belongings and gain in sarcasm as the three travelers approach their destination. The account includes the writer's impressions of the Moldavian landscape, and his stated preference for the mountainous landscape of the west, which the cart was leaving behind, to the areas over the Siret River (where, according to Luca, [...] "the water's bad and wood is scarce; in summer you're smothered with heat and the mosquitoes <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> torment"). The chapter and volume end abruptly with a description of students from all Moldavian schools gathering into the Socola Monastery yard.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{components}} of tick saliva have potential as drugs {{to treat a}} range of conditions unrelated to tick disease. Nuttall comments that [...] "These molecules have been refined by {{millions of years of}} evolution. There are no toxicity problems, they work on a range of animals, they aren't fragile — and there <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> lot of them." [...] For example, with Guido Paesen, Nuttall has characterised histamine-binding proteins that can suppress inflammation in humans by binding directly to histamine, rather than blocking its access to cell receptors, of which at least four are known. One of these proteins, rEV131, was investigated by NERC spin-off company Evolutec for the treatment of hay fever and for use in recovery from cataract surgery. Another example is the anticoagulant variegin, discovered by Nuttall and Maria Kazimirova in the tropical bont tick (Amblyomma variegatum), which represents a novel class of thrombin inhibitor; it has been shown to prevent venous thrombosis in a zebrafish model.|$|E
