This was done at Goldstone, California, Canberra, and Madrid using the additional dish antennas available there. Also, in Australia, the Parkes Radio Telescope was brought into the array {{in time for the}} fly-by of Neptune in 1989. In the United States, the Very Large Array in New Mexico was brought into temporary use along with the antennas of the Deep Space Network at Goldstone. Using this new technology of antenna arrays helped to compensate for the immense radio distance from Neptune to the Earth.|$|E
500|$|The only {{instance}} of the name [...] "phylacteries" [...] in ancient times occurs once in the Greek New Testament (...) whence it has passed into the languages of Europe. [...] "Phylacteries" [...] derives from the Greek phulaktērion - φυλακτήριον, [...] "defences," [...] and in late Greek, [...] "amulets" [...] or [...] "charms." [...] Neither Aquila nor Symmachus use the word [...] "phylacteries." [...] The choice of this particular Greek equivalent to render the Heb. tefillin bears witness to the ancient functional interpretation of the said device as <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> amulet. The other Greek words for “amulet” are periapta or periammata, which literally signifies “things tied around,” analogously to the Hebrew qame‘a derived from the root קמע meaning “to bind.” ...|$|E
500|$|Recording In Rainbows, Radiohead members {{mentioned}} {{a variety of}} rock, electronic, hiphop and experimental musicians as influences, including Björk, M.I.A, Liars, Modeselektor and Spank Rock. In 2011, Yorke denied that Radiohead had ever set out deliberately to change musical styles or to make [...] "experimental music", saying the band was [...] "constantly absorbing music" [...] and {{that a variety of}} musicians are always influencing their work. Drummer Clive Deamer, who has recorded and performed with Radiohead since 2011, said that Radiohead did not see themselves as a rock band and felt their methodology had closer parallels with jazz: “They deliberately try to avoid cliché and standard forms {{for the sake of the}} song ... Rock bands don't do that. It's far more like a jazz mentality." [...] In 2017, Jonny Greenwood said he saw Radiohead as [...] "just <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> arrangement to form songs using whatever technology suits the song. And that technology can be a cello or it can be a laptop. It's all sort of machinery when looked at in the right way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Roxy Miéville appears {{with the}} couple, {{as well as}} with the unseen Godard and Anne-Marie Miéville at the end of the film. Godard and his {{long-term}} professional and romantic partner Miéville co-own Roxy, but no longer live together. During the film's production Godard would often talk about Miéville. Olivier Séguret of Libération observed that most of the film was shot in places Godard shared with Miéville in their personal life and that the dialogue between the two couples could be based on conversations between them. When interviewed by NPR, Bordwell interpreted the shots of Roxy as Godard [...] "trying to get people to look at the world in <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unspoiled way... There are hints throughout the film that animal consciousness is kind of closer to the world than we are, that language sets up a barrier or filter or screen between us and what's really there. And although the film is full of language, talk, printed text and so on, nevertheless I think there's a sense he wants the viewer to scrape away a lot of the ordinary conceptions we have about how we communicate and look at the world afresh." [...] Godard said that it was partially true that he sees the world through Roxy's eyes and that Roxy [...] "restores balance" [...] to the couple when they are in conflict and represent [...] "the commoners" [...] while the couple represents [...] "nobility" [...] or [...] "the clergy." [...] MacCabe wrote that Roxy [...] "offer an image of acceptable sociality" [...] in the film. In a scene with Roxy, a narrator talks about the Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare, which Brody calls [...] "Godard's one rare glimmer of historical optimism. It's as if Roxy were the agent of reconciliation—not of one merely lover to another but of Godard to the present day, to the rising generation." ...|$|E
