40|$|Two micrometeorological {{techniques}} for measuring trace gas emission rates from distributed area sources were evaluated {{using a variety}} of synthetic area sources. The vertical radial plume mapping (VRPM) and the backward Lagrangian stochastic (bLS) techniques with an open-path optical spectroscopic sensor were evaluated for relative accuracy for multiple emission-source and sensor configurations. The relative accuracy was calculated by dividing the measured emission rate by the actual emission rate; thus, a relative accuracy of 1. 0 represents a perfect measure. For a single <b>area</b> <b>emission</b> <b>source,</b> the VRPM technique yielded a somewhat high relative accuracy of 1. 38 ± 0. 28. The bLS technique resulted in a relative accuracy close to unity, 0. 98 ± 0. 24. Relative accuracies for dual source emissions for the VRPM and bLS techniques were somewhat similar to single source emissions, 1. 23 ± 0. 17 and 0. 94 ± 0. 24, respectively. When the bLS technique was used with vertical point concentrations, the relative accuracy was unacceptably low...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} constructs a 1 km × 1 km Shanghai {{energy consumption}} and carbon emission spatial grid through a bottom-up approach. First, we locate all energy consumption locations in Shanghai via GIS. Second, we calculate energy consumption and associated CO 2 emissions by energy type, by usage type, and by facilities. Finally, {{we use a}} spatial grid to represent the energy consumption and CO 2 emissions. The grid shows CO 2 emissions in Shanghai are highly spatially correlated with energy types and volumes of consumption. This research also finds out that high energy consumption and carbon emission locations in Shanghai display significant spatial aggregation. In 7209 spatial energy consumption cells, the top 10 grids of emissions account for 52. 8 % of total CO 2 emissions in Shanghai; the top 20 grids account for 64. 5 % and the top 50 grids account for 76. 5 %. The most critical point <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> are coal-fired power plants and iron and steel plants. The most important line <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> are the Yan’an Road and Inner Ring viaducts.

40|$|Air quality {{monitoring}} and modeling indicate that regional ozone concentrations {{will play a}} major role in determining whether the state’s urban areas meet the new National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone (with concentrations averaged over 8 -hours). The <b>sources</b> of <b>emissions</b> leading to elevated regional ozone concentrations include the state’s urban <b>areas,</b> rural <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> and sources outside of the state. Preliminary analyses indicate that all of these sources are significant and none can be ignored in developing a strategy for reducing regional ozone concentrations. Therefore, in designing strategies to meet the new NAAQS for ozone (with concentrations averaged over 8 -hours), the State of Texas should develop an integrated and comprehensive approach for reducing regional ozone concentrations. The development of this strategy will require information, that is not currently available, about the relative importance of <b>emissions</b> in urban <b>areas,</b> <b>emissions</b> in rural <b>areas</b> and <b>emissions</b> outside of the state in creating elevated regional concentrations of ozone. The following analysis and data collection activities should be performed.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to carry out a review of {{scientific}} literature published in Brazil between 2000 and 2009 on the characteristics of air pollutants from different <b>emission</b> <b>sources,</b> especially particulate matter (PM) and its effects on respiratory health. Using electronic databases, a systematic literature review was performed of all research related to air pollutant emissions.

The PM 2. 5 is composed predominantly of organic compounds with 20 % of inorganic elements. Higher concentrations of metals were detected in metropolitan areas than in biomass burning regions. The relative risk of hospital admissions due to respiratory diseases in children was higher than in the elderly population.

Twenty-eight European countries, almost 7000 sites and about 100 individuals {{have been involved in the}} most recent survey in 2000 / 2001. The survey provides data on concentrations of 10 heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, lead, mercury, nickel, vanadium, zinc) in naturally growing mosses throughout Europe. The technique of moss analysis provides a surrogate measure of the spatial patterns of heavy metal deposition from the atmosphere to terrestrial systems, and is easier and cheaper than conventional precipitation analysis. The aims of the survey are to determine patterns of variation in the heavy metal concentration of mosses across Europe, identify the main polluted areas, produce regional maps and further develop the understanding of long-range transboundary pollution. As in previous surveys, there was an east/west decrease in heavy metal concentrations in mosses, related in particular to industrial emissions. Former industrial sites and historic mines accounted for the location of some high concentrations in areas without contemporary industries. Long-range transboundary transport appears to account for elevated concentrations of heavy metals in <b>areas</b> without <b>emission</b> <b>sources,</b> such as lead in southern Scandinavia (presumably from <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> elsewhere in Europe) ...|$|R

40|$|The eight Great Lakes {{states and}} the {{province}} of Ontario, with the coordination of the Great Lakes Commission, have developed air toxics emission inventories of point, area, and mobile sources for calendar years 1996 and 1997 in the Great Lakes Region. The states and province of Ontario collaborated particularly on the review and preparation of <b>area</b> <b>source</b> <b>emission</b> estimates, {{in response to a}} lack of appropriate guidance on that source category nationwide. The 1996 and 1997 regional inventories focused on 82 target compounds. However, data were only available to obtain emissions for 77 pollutants in 1996 and for 75 in 1997. The results show that area sources are responsible for more than one third of total emissions, about 2. 8 times the point source contributions. Area sources also contribute more than or close to two thirds of the emissions for 15 PAHs and about 10 non-metal compounds (seven in 1996 and 11 in 1997), and more than 50 % of the emissions for one metal compound among air toxics inventoried.

40|$|The MM 5 -SMOKE-CMAQ model system, {{which was}} {{developed}} by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) as the MODELS- 3 system, has been used for daily air quality forecasts in the Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center (Beijing MEMC), {{as a part of the}} Ensemble air quality Modeling forecast System for Beijing (EMS-Beijing) since the 2008 Olympic Games. According to the daily forecast results for the entire duration of 2010, the model shows good performance in the PM 10 forecast on most days but clearly underestimates PM 10 concentration during some air pollution episodes. A typical air pollution episode from 11 – 20 January 2010 was chosen, in which the observed air pollution index of particulate matter (PM 10 -API) reached 180 while the forecast PM 10 -API was about 100. In this study, three numerical methods are used for model improvement: first, by enhancing the inner domain with 3 km resolution grids, and expanding the coverage from only Beijing to an area including Beijing and its surrounding cities; second, by adding more regional point <b>source</b> <b>emissions</b> located at Baoding, Landfang and Tangshan, to the south and east of Beijing; third, by updating the <b>area</b> <b>source</b> <b>emissions,</b> including the regional <b>area</b> <b>source</b> <b>emissions</b> in Baoding and Tangshan and the local village/town-level <b>area</b> <b>source</b> <b>emissions</b> in Beijing. The last two methods are combined as the updated emissions method. According to the model sensitivity testing results by the CMAQ model, the updated emissions method and expanded model domain method can both improve the model performance separately. But the expanded model domain method has better ability to capture the peak values of PM 10 than the updated emissions method due to better reproduction of the pollution transport process in this episode. As a result, the hindcast results ("New(CMAQ) "), which are driven by the updated emissions in the expanded model domain, show a much better model performance in the national standard station-averaged PM 10 -API. The daily hindcast PM 10 -API reaches 180 and is much closer to the observed value, and has a high correlation coefficient of 0. 93. The correlation coefficient of the PM 10 -API in all Beijing MEMC stations between the hindcast and observation is 0. 82, clearly higher than the forecast 0. 54. The FAC 2 increases from 56 % in the forecast to 84 % in the hindcast, and the NMSE decreases from 0. 886 to 0. 196. The hindcast also has better model performance in PM 10 hourly concentrations during the typical air pollution episode. The updated emissions method accompanied by a suitable domain in this study improved the model performance for the Beijing area significantly...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{models of}} the spatial {{distribution}} of ammonia (NH 3) emissions are an essential input to models of atmospheric transport and deposition. This is especially important when resulting deposition maps are used to calculate patterns of critical loads exceedance or to determine suitable abatement measures. A new methodology has been developed to model the distribution of agricultural ammonia emissions and is applied here for the UK. The model employs a specific spatial weighted redistribution of NH 3 <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> onto suitable landcover types at a 1 -km grid level. Key input data to the model are agricultural census data, a satellite-based landcover map and estimates of NH 3 <b>emission</b> <b>source</b> strength. The model provides more realistic spatial NH 3 emission estimates than previous models, especially for semi-natural/natural <b>areas</b> by relocating <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> from extensively used upland areas to the more intensively farmed lowland areas within each parish. At present the model results are summarised as maps at a 5 -km grid resolution to reduce uncertainty in the spatial location of NH 3 sources. Compared with coarser resolution estimates this also provides a more accurate link to critical load exceedances. The more accurate redistribution also reduces the apparent critical loads exceedance on upland areas. Results are presented and compared for 1988 and 1996. These show broadly similar patterns between the years, although substantial local changes have occurred, particularly for intensive livestock farming. The model {{has been used to}} generate initial spatially resolved abatement scenarios and provides a general tool for locating NH 3 emissions that could be applied to other regions. ...|$|R

State, local, and tribal agencies have periodically had opportunity to provide comment s, corrections, and bottom-up supplemental data to these inventories. The incorporation of bottom-up emissions data has always been encouraged by EPA to improve the NEI.

40|$|Lindane is a {{persistent}} organochlorine insecticide {{and the use}} of this insecticide in agriculture was banned in France in 1998. In this study we investigated the concentrations of lindane in topsoil in Northern France and used robust geostatistics to map the geographical distribution of lindane. The study was based on a 16 km × 16 km grid covering an area of ca 25 000 km 2. Lindane was found in all soils, even those from non-agricultural-application areas. Very low ratios of α-/γ-HCH and δ-/γ-HCH suggested that a long time had passed since technical HCH was used in the studied <b>area,</b> or that <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> of lindane were still present. A strong gradient in lindane concentration was observed, with the highest lindane concentrations in an area located in the northern region.

40|$|Observations {{from the}} 2007 Border Air Quality and Meteorology Study (BAQS-Met 2007) in Southern Ontario, Canada, {{were used to}} {{evaluate}} predictions of primary organic aerosol (POA) and two other carbonaceous species, black carbon (BC) and carbon monoxide (CO), made for this summertime period by Environment Canada's AURAMS regional chemical transport model. Particle component-based factor analysis was applied to aerosol mass spectrometer measurements made at one urban site (Windsor, ON) and two rural sites (Harrow and Bear Creek, ON) to derive hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (HOA) factors. A novel diagnostic model evaluation was performed by investigating model POA bias {{as a function of}} HOA mass concentration and indicator ratios (e. g. BC/HOA). Eight case studies were selected based on factor analysis and back trajectories to help classify model bias for certain POA source types. By considering model POA bias in relation to co-located BC and CO biases, a plausible story is developed that explains the model biases for all three species. At the rural sites, daytime mean PM 1 POA mass concentrations were under-predicted compared to observed HOA concentrations. POA under-predictions were accentuated when the transport arriving at the rural sites was from the Detroit/Windsor urban complex and for short-term periods of biomass burning influence. Interestingly, the daytime CO concentrations were only slightly under-predicted at both rural sites, whereas CO was over-predicted at the urban Windsor site with a normalized mean bias of 134 %, while good agreement was observed at Windsor for the comparison of daytime PM 1 POA and HOA mean values, 1. 1 μg m− 3 and 1. 2 μg m− 3 , respectively. Biases in model POA predictions also trended from positive to negative with increasing HOA values. Periods of POA over-prediction were most evident at the urban site on calm nights due to an overly-stable model surface layer. This model behaviour can be explained by a combination of model under-estimation of vertical mixing at the urban location, under-representation of PM emissions for on-road traffic exhaust along major urban roads and highways, and a more structured allocation of area POA sources such as food cooking and dust emissions to urban locations. A downward trend in POA bias was also observed at the urban site {{as a function of the}} BC/HOA indicator ratio, suggesting a possible association of POA under-prediction with under-representation of diesel combustion sources. An investigation of the emission inventories for the province of Ontario and the nearby US state of Indiana also suggested that the top POA <b>area</b> <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> (food cooking, organic-bound to dust, waste disposal burning) dominated over mobile and point sources, again consistent with a mobile under-estimation. We conclude that more effort should be placed at reducing uncertainties in the treatment of several large POA <b>emission</b> <b>sources,</b> in particular food cooking, fugitive dust, waste disposal burning, and on-road traffic sources, and especially their spatial surrogates and temporal profiles. This includes using higher spatial resolution model grids to better resolve the urban road network and urban food cooking locations. We also recommend that additional sources of urban-scale vertical mixing in the model, such as a stronger urban heat island effect and vehicle-induced turbulence, would help model predictions at urban locations, especially at night time...|$|R

According to WHO (WHO, 2014) outdoor air pollution caused 3. 7 million premature deaths in 2012, most of them in urban <b>areas</b> where both, <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> and population concentrate. Even in Europe, despite of significant efforts, exceedances of air quality standards are common in large urban areas, particularly for NO 2 (EEA, 2014).

However, air pollution dynamics in urban environments is extremely complex and the design and assessment of effective emission abatement plans and measures posses a major scientific challenge. Emissions of different pollutants from a variety of sources interact through intertwined atmospheric transport processes and chemical transformations involving several spatial and temporal scales. In this context, air quality modelling constitutes an essential research tool for understanding and simulating the potential effect of emission abatement measures as well as to identify the best course of action to improve air quality in cities.

40|$|Air {{pollution}} emissions control {{strategies to}} reduce ozone precursor pollutants are analyzed by applying a photochemical modeling system. Simulations of air quality conditions during an ozone episode which occurred in June, 2006 are undertaken by increasing or reducing <b>area</b> <b>source</b> <b>emissions</b> in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico. ^ Two air pollutants are primary drivers {{in the formation}} of tropospheric ozone. Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) undergo multiple chemical reactions under favorable meteorological conditions to form ozone, which is a secondary pollutant that irritates respiratory systems in sensitive individuals especially the elderly and young children. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to limit ambient air pollutants such as ozone by establishing an 8 -hour average concentration of 0. 075 ppm as the threshold at which a violation of the standard occurs. ^ Ozone forms primarily due reactions in the troposphere of NOx and VOC emissions generated primarily by anthropogenic sources in urban regions. Data from <b>emissions</b> inventories indicate <b>area</b> <b>sources</b> account for ∼ 15 of NOx and ∼ 45 % of regional VOC <b>emissions.</b> <b>Area</b> <b>sources</b> include gasoline stations, automotive paint bodyshops and nonroad mobile sources. Multiplicity of air pollution <b>emissions</b> <b>sources</b> provides an opportunity to investigate and potentially implement air quality improvement strategies to reduce emissions which contribute to elevated ozone concentrations. ^ A baseline modeling scenario was established using the CAMx photochemical air quality model from which a series of sensitivity analyses for evaluating air quality control strategies were conducted. Modifications to <b>area</b> <b>source</b> <b>emissions</b> were made by varying NOx and / or VOC <b>emissions</b> in the <b>areas</b> of particular interest. Model performance was assessed for each sensitivity analysis. Normalized bias (NB) and normalized error (NE) were used to identify variability of the PREDICTED to OBSERVED ozone concentrations of both BASELINE model and simulations with modified emissions assessed by the sensitivity analysis. All simulations were found to vary within acceptable ranges of these two criteria variables. ^ Simulation results indicate ozone formation in the PdN region is VOC-limited. Under VOC-limited conditions, modifications to NOx emissions do not produce a marked increase or decrease in ozone concentrations. Modifications to VOC emissions generated the highest variability in ozone concentrations. Increasing VOC emissions by 75 % produced results which minimized model bias and error when comparing PREDICTED and OBSERVED ozone concentrations. Increasing VOC emissions by 75 % either alone or in combination with a 75 % increase in NOx emissions generated PREDICTED ozone concentrations very near to OBSERVED ozone. ^ By evaluating the changes in ambient ozone concentrations through photochemical modeling, air quality planners may identify the most efficient or effective VOC emissions control strategies for area sources. Among the strategies to achieve emissions reductions are installation of gasoline vapor recovery systems, replacing high-pressure low-volume surface coating paint spray guns with high-volume low-pressure spray paint guns, requiring emissions control booths for surface coating operations as well as undertaking solvent management practices, requiring the sale of low VOC paint solvents in the surface-coating industry, and requiring low-VOC solvents in the dry cleaning industry. Other strategies to reduce VOC emissions include initiating Eco-Driving strategies to reduce fuel consumption from mobile sources and minimize vehicle idling at the international ports of entry by reducing bridge wait times. ^ This dissertation depicts a tool for evaluating impacts of emissions on regional air quality by addressing the highly unresolved fugitive emissions in the Paso del Norte region. It provides a protocol for decision makers to assess the effects of various emission control strategies in the region. Impacts of specific source categories such as the international ports of entry, gasoline stations, paint body shops, truck stops, and military installations on the regional air quality can be easily and systematically addressed in a timely manner in the future. ...|$|R

The impact of pellet boiler emissions on secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from α-pinene photo-oxidation was studied under atmospherically relevant conditions in an environmental chamber. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify which of the major pellet exhaust components (including high nitrogen oxide (NOx), primary particles, or a combination of the two) affected SOA formation from α-pinene. Results demonstrated that high NOx concentrations emitted by the pellet boiler reduced SOA yields from α-pinene, whereas the chemical properties of the primary particles emitted by the pellet boiler had no effect on observed SOA yields. The maximum SOA yield of α-pinene in the presence of pellet boiler exhaust (under high-NOx conditions) was 18. 7 % and in the absence of pellet boiler exhaust (under low-NOx conditions) was 34. 1 %. The reduced SOA yield under high-NOx conditions was caused by changes in gas-phase chemistry that led to the formation of organonitrate compounds...|$|R

This is particularly evident in urban <b>areas</b> where <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> are integrated in the highly heterogeneous urban canopy layer and directly linked to human activities which exhibit significant temporal variability. It is common practice to use eddy covariance observations to estimate turbulent surface fluxes of latent heat, sensible heat and carbon dioxide, which can be attributed to a local scale source area. This study provides a method to assess the influence of micro-scale anthropogenic emissions on heat, moisture and carbon dioxide exchange in a highly urbanized environment for two sites in central London, UK. A new algorithm for the Identification of Micro-scale Anthropogenic Sources (IMAS) is presented, with two aims. Firstly, IMAS filters out the influence of micro-scale emissions and allows for the analysis of the turbulent fluxes representative of the local scale source area. Secondly, it is used to give a first order estimate of anthropogenic heat flux and carbon dioxide flux representative of the building scale. The algorithm is evaluated using directional and temporal analysis. The algorithm is then used at a second site which was not incorporated in its development. The spatial and temporal local scale patterns, as well as micro-scale fluxes, appear physically reasonable and can be incorporated in the analysis of long-term eddy covariance measurements at the sites in central London. In addition to the new IMAS-technique, further steps in quality control and quality assurance used for the flux processing are presented. The methods and results have implications for urban flux measurements in dense urbanised settings with significant sources of heat and greenhouse gases...|$|R

The source parameters extracted from these functions at low k(T) give first indications {{of a long}} tail for the pion <b>emission</b> <b>source.</b> The source extension cannot be explained solely by simple kinematic considerations.

40|$|The Western Regional Air Partnership (WRAP) is a {{collaborative}} effort of tribal governments, state governments, and various federal agencies to implement {{the recommendations of the}} Grand Canyon Visibility Transport Commission (GCVTC) and to develop the technical and policy tools needed by western states and tribes to comply with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's Regional Haze Rule. The goal of the WRAP Areas Within and Near Class I Areas Forum is to implement the GCVTC's recommendation to expand data collection, improve modeling, and implement cooperative, enforceable management plans in and near Class I <b>areas</b> where <b>emissions</b> from such <b>areas</b> are significant. This paper will describe geographic information systems (GIS) and other data sources and methods used to portray the dominant activities and <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> surrounding each western Class I area. The paper will also discuss methods used to classify the area according to magnitude, trend, seasonality, and dominant type of <b>emission</b> <b>source(s).</b> The paper will show examples of maps showing the emissions and activities around each Class I area...|$|R

Information on wood structure, wood failure behavior and computer-generated finite element method (FEM) simulation of static bending test were used to localize and estimate power of individual acoustic <b>emission</b> <b>sources.</b> Significant acoustic <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> are expected in the specimen in two areas: under the upper central support (during the entire bending test run) and in the tension portion of the specimen at the centre of lower baseline (at the fracture/destruction time). Strong acoustic <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> were registered in tension portion of the specimen in direct connection with final fracture of specimen...|$|R

Where low <b>emissions</b> <b>sources</b> are available, net production of pollutants can be reduced. Emission control measures at a central generating plant {{may be more effective}} and less costly than treating the emissions of widely dispersed vehicles.|$|R
40|$|The first {{comprehensive}} national {{emissions inventory}} {{for the country}} of Mexico is currently under development. The Mexico National Emissions Inventory (NEI) project, which began in 2001, is being conducted in three phases over three years. Phase I covered program planning and organization, {{and development of the}} Inventory Preparation Plan. Phase II, which {{is the subject of this}} paper, includes the development of the inventory for the six northern Mexican states of Baja California, Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas. Future work in Phase III will result in an emissions inventory for the remaining Mexican states. The Mexico NEI includes emissions estimates for seven pollutants (VOC, CO, NOx, SO 2, PM 10, PM 2. 5, and NH 3) generated by point, area, natural, and on- and off-road mobile sources. This paper focuses on the point and <b>area</b> <b>source</b> <b>emissions</b> inventory status. Point source inventory development includes obtaining data from two important sources: the DATGEN database and the Cédula de Operación (COA) annual reports. These data are maintained for federal and state jurisdiction point sources. Current activities include identifying all COAs, ensuring their quality, and compiling them into one comprehensive database for the northern Mexican states. Area source data ar...|$|R
