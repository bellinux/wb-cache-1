According to our current understanding, the Universe consists of spacetime, forms of energy (including electromagnetic radiation and matter), and the physical laws that relate them.

25|$|The Francis A. Schaeffer Foundation in Gryon, Switzerland {{is led by}} one of {{his daughters}} and sons-in-law as a {{small-scale}} alternative to the original L'Abri Fellowship International, which is still operating in nearby Huemoz-sur-Ollon and other places in the world. Covenant Theological Seminary has established the Francis A. Schaeffer Institute directed by a former English L'Abri member, Jerram Barrs. The purpose of the school is to train Christians to demonstrate compassionately and defend reasonably {{what they see as the}} claims of Christ on <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
25|$|Today, {{this term}} also {{refers to the}} doctrines and {{practices}} of the Reformed churches of which Calvin was an early leader. Less commonly, it can refer to the individual teaching of Calvin himself. The particulars of Calvinist theology may be stated {{in a number of}} ways. Perhaps the best known summary is contained in the five points of Calvinism, though these points identify the Calvinist view on soteriology rather than summarizing the system as a whole. Broadly speaking, Calvinism stresses the sovereignty or rule of God in all things—in salvation but also in <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> This concept is seen clearly in the doctrines of predestination and total depravity.|$|E
25|$|Based {{in part on}} teachings {{by writers}} such as Walter Brueggemann and Leonard Sweet, the Disciple's Generous Response {{can be traced to}} a {{theology}} or liturgy of abundance, as well as the principle of receiving God's abundance. Like many recent enhancements of church doctrine and practice, it is described as belonging to a postmodernism trend in thinking within the church. While carefully built upon the many differing stewardship principles in both overall Christian and specific Community of Christ traditions, the new thinking emphasizes a natural generosity in <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> lived as response to the overwhelming and incomparable generosity of God. As such, tithing is not limited to World Church giving as in the past, or even to the church at all. Through the principle of community tithes, almost any charitable organization to which a disciple contributes could be considered tithing. While most giving is now seen as tithing, the typical interpretation is that a majority of one's tithing should be given in Mission Tithes (Tithes to Local and World Church) and the minority to Community Tithes (Organizations like Outreach International, Graceland University, Restoration Trails Foundation, World Accord, etc.) The church teaches the principle of community tithes believing that it will not decrease giving to the church, but rather increase it as more members embrace a fully generous and responsive way of living.|$|E

2500|$|Hirsch's Torah im Derech Eretz ( [...] – [...] "Torah {{with the}} way of the Land") is a {{philosophy}} of Orthodox Judaism that formalizes a relationship between halakhically observant Judaism and the modern world. Hirsch held that Judaism requires the application of Torah philosophy to all human endeavor and knowledge compatible with it. Thus, secular education becomes a positive religious duty. [...] "Judaism is not a mere adjunct to life: It comprises <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> ... in the synagogue and the kitchen, in the field and the warehouse, in the office and the pulpit ... with the pen and the chisel." [...] Hirsch's vision, although not unqualified, extended to the sciences as well as to (German) literature, philosophy and culture. Torah im Derech Eretz remains influential to this day in all branches of Orthodox Judaism.|$|E

Conservative Friends place their trust in the immediate guidance of God. Conservative Friends completely reject all forms of religious symbolism and outward sacraments, such as the Eucharist and water baptism. Conservative Friends do not believe in relying upon the practice of outward rites and sacraments, to have a living relationship with God through Christ; believing that holiness can exist in all of the activities of one's daily life—and that <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is sacred in God. Many Conservative Friends believe that a meal held with others can become a form of communion with God, and with one another.|$|E
2500|$|Simeona's {{version is}} {{influenced}} by her Christian (Protestant and Catholic) education and her philosophical studies about India, China and Edgar Cayce. Like Hawaiian tradition she emphasizes prayer, confession, repentance, and mutual restitution and forgiveness. Unlike Hawaiian tradition, she describes problems only as the effects of negative karma, saying that [...] "you have to experience by yourself {{what you have done}} to others." [...] But that you are the creator of your life circumstances was common knowledge for the people of old as [...] "things we had brought with us from other lifetimes." [...] Any wrongdoing is memorized within oneself and mirrored in every entity and object which was present when the cause happened. As the Law of Cause and Effect predominates in <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and lifetimes, the purpose of her version is mainly [...] "to release unhappy, negative experiences in past reincarnations, and to resolve and remove traumas from the 'memory banks'." [...] Karmic bondages hinder the evolution of mind, so that [...] "(karmic) cleansing is a requisite for the expansion of awareness". Using her 14-step-process would dissolve those bondages. She did not use mantras or conditioning exercises.|$|E
2500|$|Reading [...] Philo {{noted that}} Moses took some {{blood from the}} sacrificed ram, holding a vial under it to catch it, and with it he anointed three {{parts of the body}} of the {{initiated}} priests – the tip of the ear, the extremity of the hand, and the extremity of the foot, all on the right side. Philo taught that this signified that the perfect person must be pure in every word and action, and in <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> for it is the hearing that judges a person's words, and the hand is the symbol of action, and the foot {{of the way in which}} a person walks in life. Philo taught that since each of these parts is an extremity of the body, and is likewise on the right side, this indicated that improvement in everything is to be arrived at by dexterity, being a portion of felicity, and being the true aim in life, which a person must necessarily labor to attain, and to which a person ought to refer all actions, aiming at them in life as an archer aims at a target.|$|E
