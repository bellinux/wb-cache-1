40|$|The streptococcal <b>antifibrinolysin</b> test of Tillett and Garner (1) was {{at first}} thought to be diag-nostic of recent {{hemolytic}} streptococcal infections. Subsequent studies have shown, however, that the test may be non-specific, increased amounts of <b>antifibrinolysin</b> having been noted in other dis-eases, such as gonococcal arthritis (2) strepto-coccus viridans bacteremia (3) and pneumococcal pneumonia (4). The present communication deals with the rela-tion of sulfonamides {{to the production of}} anti-fibrinolysin. An increased resistance to fibrinoly-sis was found by Hines, Hoover, and Graff (5) in patients receiving sulfanilamide. This in-creased liquefaction time paralleled, in general...|$|E
40|$|The streptococcal <b>antifibrinolysin</b> test of Tillett and Garner (1) had {{promise of}} being a {{practical}} serological method for the diagnosis of a recent hemolytic streptococcal infection. The test is simple to perform, inexpensive, and uniform in its results. In the experience of Tillett and his asso-ciates (2, 3), the test was generally positive in diseases caused by the hemolytic streptococcus, and negative in non-streptococcal infections. Subse-quent observations by other investigators, how-ever, indicated that the <b>antifibrinolysin</b> test is non-specific. Myers, Keefer and Holmes (4) obtained strongly positive tests in 2 of 6 patients with gonococcal arthritis, and in 2 cases of bac-terial endocarditis due to the streptococcus viri...|$|E
40|$|The {{vaccination}} with hemolytic streptococci {{washed in}} saline doesn't {{give to the}} plasma of vaccinated people resistence against fibrinolysis, when in presence of antistreptofibrinolysin. The A. A. believe that the fibrinolysin in solube is the culture medium {{and that it is}} necessary to the formation of the <b>antifibrinolysin.</b> This fact is important in the preparation of the antistreptococcal serum which must be antibacterian, antitoxic and antifibrinolytic...|$|E
40|$|The {{resistance}} of human plasma clots to dissolu-tion by fibrinolysin {{is generally considered}} an im-munological response to infection by,B-hemolytic streptococci (1, 2). Consequently, the develop-ment of resistant clots during convalescence {{has been used as}} a diagnostic test for streptococcal disease. However, clot resistance has also been observed in individuals where no evidence of strep-tococcal infection could be recognized. Positive <b>antifibrinolysin</b> tests, for example, have been re-ported in the following instances: 15 per cent of normal individuals (3, 4); in a number of un-related disease states, as lobar pneumonia, gono-coccal arthritis, typhoid fever, and acute nephritis (5 to 7); in the newborn (8, 6); and in various animal species (9, 1). These findings, in turn, have placed some doubt on the specificity of the <b>antifibrinolysin</b> response. Recent advances in the study of the mechanism of streptococcal fibrinolysis, however, have made it necessary to review these non-specific cases of antifibrinolysis in the light of the new findings. It has been shown (10 to 12) that the lytic factor (13) which participates in streptococcal fibrinoly-sis is the precursor of a proteolytic enzyme in plasma, which is activated by streptococcal fibri-nolysin. Fibrinolysis results from the proteolytic action of this activated enzyme. Thus two stages are involved in the process: (1) Conversion of the lytic factor by fibrinoly-sin into an active protease...|$|E
40|$|The {{inhibitory}} effect of normal serum on cer-tain proteolytic enzymes {{has been recognized}} {{since the end of}} the century. Grob (1) has presented an excellent historical review of the subject. Se-rum <b>antifibrinolysin</b> (antiplasmin) content has been determined by a number of methods, involving measurement of the decrease in activity of a stand-ard enzyme solution with employment of various substrates for measurement of this enzyme activity and differing also in the type of standard enzyme used. The present method has been adapted from that of Kaplan (2) and employs the rate of fibrin-olysis as a measurement of proteolytic activity and, for routine use, human plasma Fraction III- 3 as a standard enzyme. This method differs fro...|$|E
40|$|Injection of ACTH or {{cortisone}} has {{no effect}} on the amount of fibrinolysin resulting from the activation of profibrinolysin by peptone. Antifibrinolytic activity of serum is significantly increased by ACTH or cortisone but not by desoxycorticosterone or corticosterone. No increase in anti-fibrinolytic power of serum is produced, however, by the injection of ACTH or cortisone in splenectomized guinea pigs. Splenin A has the same action on fibrinolysin inactivation as ACTH or cortisone. Splenin B has the opposite effect. This action on the antifibrinolytic power of serum appears to be due to an acceleration of the rate of combination between the enzyme and its inhibitor and not to an actual increase in <b>antifibrinolysin.</b> The possible significance of these observations is discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{measurement}} of fibrinolysin production by beta hemolytic streptococci is described. The test was shown to be highly accurate in that repeated determinations showed only small variations. A study of 766 strains of beta hemolytic streptococci isolated from normal soldiers and patients with respiratory disease showed that fibrinolysin was produced by Lancefield groups A, C, and G, and, in addition, by a few strains of groups B and F. Group A streptococci produced more fibrinolysin on the average than the other groups. The median titers were 117 for group A, 61 for group C, and 20 for group G streptococci. In a study of 388 typed group A streptococci from different subjects the fibrinolytic capacity of an organism was shown {{to be related to}} the serological type. The importance of this observation in relation to the role of streptococcal fibrinolysis in infections is discussed. Finally, it was demonstrated that strains of streptococci which produced large amounts of fibrinolysin were capable of stimulating <b>antifibrinolysin</b> formation in patients whereas strains that produced small amounts only occasionally caused antibody formation...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{significant changes}} in the serum plasmin and urine fibrinolytic activity observed in dogs dying of the hemorrhagic syndrome following large dose whole body irradiation. Although fibrinolysis {{has been the subject of}} speculation in the pathogenesis of the postirmdiation hemorrhagic syndrome in goats (1), no studies of the relation of large doses of whole body irradiation to changes in fibrinolytic enzyme activity have come to our attention. It has been known for sometime that the normal serum of man and other mammals contains a proteolytic enzyme, plasmin (fibrinolysin), which is potentially capable of digesting a fibrin clot and changing fibrinogen so that it will not dot with thrombin. Normally this enzyme exists in blood in the form of an inactive precursor plasminogen (profibrinolysin, proplasmin) which can be activated by streptokinase (2) or chloroform (3, 4), or spontaneously activated following the removal of normal serum inhibitor antiplasmin (<b>antifibrinolysin)</b> described by Grob (5), Loomis (6), and Astrup and Permin (7). Activation of plasminogen may occur in the intact animal by means of a physiological activator in tissue ceils called "cytofibrinokinase " by Permin (8, 9) ...|$|E
