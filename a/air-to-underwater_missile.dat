50|$|The {{origins of}} the Petrel {{date back to the}} 1950s, when the U.S. Navy Bureau of Ordnance (BuOrd) began the Kingfisher program, {{intending}} to develop a series of standoff torpedo weapons. The Kingfisher C, later known as the AUM-2 and then as AUM-N-2 (AUM representing <b>Air-to-Underwater</b> <b>Missile),</b> was designed as an air-launched jet-powered missile which carried a torpedo warhead. Various different design options were considered for this missile; the final choice was a Mark 21 homing torpedo, with a Fairchild J44 turbojet engine, wooden fins and wings, and a nose housing guidance equipment. On launch the missile dropped to 60 meters (200 feet) above the water and cruised at Mach 0.5 towards the target, using semi-active radar homing. At a range of just under 1,500 meters (4,600 feet) the engine shut down and all wings and fins were jettisoned. The torpedo dropped on a free trajectory into the water and began to home in on the target. The weapon was suitable for use against surface targets only - primarily ships and surfaced submarines. The AUM-2 was usually carried by the Lockheed P-2 Neptune.|$|E
50|$|MX designations were {{a series}} of designations used for {{experimental}} weapon system programs, including jet- and rocket-powered precision-guided munitions, designed and manufactured by U.S. defense contractors under contracts provided by the United States Army Air Force (1945 - 1947), the United States Air Force (1947 - 1954) and the United States Navy. Some of those missile projects, which were equally applicable for naval uses (e.g. air-to-surface anti-ship <b>missiles</b> and <b>air-to-underwater</b> anti-submarine <b>missiles,)</b> eventually have been transferred to the Navy, and later developed {{under the auspices of}} Naval research facilities.|$|R
