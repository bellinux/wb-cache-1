5|$|Between 1835 and 1837, the {{zoologist}} Edward Blyth {{worked on}} the area of variation, <b>artificial</b> <b>selection,</b> and how a similar process occurs in nature. Darwin acknowledged Blyth's ideas in the first chapter on variation of On the Origin of Species.|$|E
5|$|Vavilovian mimicry {{is found}} in weeds that come to share {{characteristics}} with a domesticated plant through <b>artificial</b> <b>selection.</b> It is named after Russian botanist and geneticist Nikolai Vavilov. Selection against the weed may occur either by manually killing the weed, or by separating its seeds {{from those of the}} crop by winnowing.|$|E
5|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>selection</b> is the {{intentional}} selection of traits {{in a population}} of organisms. This {{has been used for}} thousands of years in the domestication of plants and animals. More recently, such selection has become a vital part of genetic engineering, with selectable markers such as antibiotic resistance genes being used to manipulate DNA. Proteins with valuable properties have evolved by repeated rounds of mutation and selection (for example modified enzymes and new antibodies) in a process called directed evolution.|$|E

50|$|Generally, <b>artificial</b> action <b>selection</b> {{mechanisms}} can {{be divided}} into several categories: symbol-based systems sometimes known as classical planning, distributed solutions, and reactive or dynamic planning. Some approaches do not fall neatly into any one of these categories. Others are really more about providing scientific models than practical AI control; these last are described further in the next section.|$|R
40|$|The {{adaptation}} of death-feigning (thanatosis), {{a subject that}} has been overlooked in evolutionary biology, was inferred in a model prey-and-predator system. We studied phenotypic variation among individuals, fitness differences, and the inheritance of death-feigning behaviour in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). Two-way <b>artificial</b> <b>selections</b> {{for the duration of}} death-feigning, over 10 generations, showed a clear direct response in the trait and a correlated response in the frequency of death-feigning, thus indicating variation and inheritance of death-feigning behaviour. A comparison of the two selected strains with divergent frequencies of death-feigning showed {{a significant difference in the}} fitness for survival when a model predator, a female Adanson jumper spider, Hasarius adansoni Audouin (Araneomophae: Salticidae), was presented to the beetles. The frequency of predation was lower among beetles from strains selected for long-duration than among those for short-duration death-feigning. The results indicate the possibility of the evolution of death-feigning under natural selection...|$|R
5|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>selection,</b> the {{deliberate}} selective breeding of domestic animals, {{is being used}} to breed back recently extinct animals in an attempt to achieve an animal breed with a phenotype that resembles that extinct wildtype ancestor. A breeding-back (intraspecific) hybrid may be very similar to the extinct wildtype in appearance, ecological niche and to some extent genetics, but the initial gene pool of that wild type is lost forever with its extinction. As a result, bred-back breeds are at best vague look-alikes of extinct wildtypes, as Heck cattle are of the aurochs.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{have either}} a mutualistic or {{commensal}} relationship with humans. Two main theories are given about how cats were domesticated. In one, people deliberately tamed cats {{in a process}} of <b>artificial</b> <b>selection</b> as they were useful predators of vermin. This has been criticized as implausible, because the reward for such an effort may have been too little; cats generally do not carry out commands and although they do eat rodents, other species such as ferrets or terriers may be better at controlling these pests. The alternative idea is that cats were simply tolerated by people and gradually diverged from their wild relatives through natural selection, as they adapted to hunting the vermin found around humans in towns and villages.|$|E
5|$|In {{computer}} science, {{simulations of}} evolution using evolutionary algorithms and artificial life {{started in the}} 1960s and were extended with simulation of <b>artificial</b> <b>selection.</b> Artificial evolution became a widely recognised optimisation method {{as a result of}} the work of Ingo Rechenberg in the 1960s. He used evolution strategies to solve complex engineering problems. Genetic algorithms in particular became popular through the writing of John Henry Holland. Practical applications also include automatic evolution of computer programmes. Evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multi-dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers and also to optimise the design of systems.|$|E

40|$|A prey animal {{may have}} the {{alternative}} of flying away or feigning death when it encounters predators. These alternatives have a genetic base as anti-predator strategies in the adzuki bean beetle, Callosobruchus chinensis. A negative genetic correlation between death-feigning intensity and flying ability was found in C. chinensis, i. e. lower flying ability is genetically connected to escaping by dropping from a perch and then feigning death, whereas higher flying ability does not correspond to death-feigning behaviour. Two bidirectional <b>artificial</b> <b>selections</b> for death-feigning duration and flying ability were conducted independently in C. chinensis. The strains selected for shorter (longer) duration of death-feigning had higher (lower) flying ability, while the strains selected for lower (higher) flying ability showed longer (shorter) duration of death-feigning. When the two traits were compared in 21 populations of C. chinensis derived from different geographical regions, a significant negative correlation was found between death-feigning intensity and flying ability. Based on these results, the choice between alternative escaping behaviours in animals is discussed from two points of view: phenotypic plasticity, an individual with two tactics; and pleiotropic genetic correlation, different individuals with opposite strategies...|$|R
5|$|Natural {{selection}} acts on the phenotype, or {{the observable}} characteristics of an organism, but the genetic (heritable) basis of any phenotype {{that gives a}} reproductive advantage may become more common in a population. Over time, this process can result in populations that specialise for particular ecological niches (microevolution) and may eventually result in speciation (the emergence of new species, macroevolution). In other words, natural selection is a key process {{in the evolution of}} a population. Natural selection can be contrasted with <b>artificial</b> <b>selection,</b> in which humans intentionally choose specific traits, whereas in natural selection there is no intentional choice.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{is one of}} the cornerstones of modern biology. The concept, published by Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in a joint presentation of papers in 1858, was elaborated in Darwin's influential 1859 book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, which described natural selection as analogous to <b>artificial</b> <b>selection,</b> a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favoured for reproduction. The concept of natural selection originally developed {{in the absence of a}} valid theory of heredity; at the time of Darwin's writing, science had yet to develop modern theories of genetics. The union of traditional Darwinian evolution with subsequent discoveries in classical genetics formed the modern synthesis of the mid-20th century. The addition of molecular genetics has led to evolutionary developmental biology, which explains evolution at the molecular level. While genotypes can slowly change by random genetic drift, natural selection remains the primary explanation for adaptive evolution.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{stands in}} {{semantic}} contrast with defensive mimicry, {{where it is}} the prey {{that acts as a}} mimic, with predators being duped. Defensive mimicry includes the well-known Batesian and Müllerian forms of mimicry, where the mimic shares outward characteristics with an aposematic or harmful model. In Batesian mimicry, the mimic is modeled on a dangerous (usually unpalatable) species, while in Müllerian mimicry both species are harmful, and act as comimics, converging on a common set of signals and sharing the burden of 'educating' their predators. Also included in defensive mimicry is the lesser known Mertensian mimicry, where the mimic is more harmful than the model, and Vavilovian mimicry, where weeds come to mimic crops through unintentional <b>artificial</b> <b>selection.</b> In defensive mimicry, the mimic benefits by avoiding a harmful interaction with another organism that {{would be more likely to}} take place without the deceptive signals employed. Harmful interactions might involve being eaten, or pulled out of the ground as a weed. In contrast, the aggressive mimic benefits from an interaction that would be less likely to take place without the deception, at the expense of its target.|$|E
25|$|Whichever {{method is}} used, the {{introduction}} of recombinant DNA into the chosen host organism is usually a low efficiency process; that is, {{only a small fraction}} of the cells will actually take up DNA. Experimental scientists deal with this issue through a step of <b>artificial</b> genetic <b>selection,</b> in which cells that have not taken up DNA are selectively killed, and only those cells that can actively replicate DNA containing the selectable marker gene encoded by the vector are able to survive.|$|R

30|$|A role {{of exotic}} or native species in {{reclamation}} needs careful consideration as newly introduced exotic species may become pests in other situations. Therefore, candidate species for vegetation should be screened carefully {{to avoid becoming}} problematic weeds in relation to local to regional floristic. For <b>artificial</b> introduction, <b>selection</b> of species that are well adapted to the local environment should be emphasized. Indigenous species are preferable to exotics because they {{are most likely to}} fit into a fully functional ecosystem and are climatically adapted (Chaney et al. 2007).|$|R
5|$|As {{porbeagles}} {{had become}} scarce in the Northeast Atlantic, in the 1960s the Norwegian fishing fleet moved {{west to the}} waters off New England and Newfoundland. A few years later, {{they were joined by}} longline vessels from the Faroe Islands. Norwegian annual catches rose from 1,900 tons in 1961 to over 9,000 tons in 1965; the catch was largely exported to Italy, where porbeagle (smeriglio) is an extremely popular food fish. Again, the stock collapsed, this time in only six years: by 1970 Norwegian catches had fallen to under 1,000 tons per year, and Faroese catches observed a similar trend. With the population decimated, most fishers moved on or switched to other species. Porbeagle numbers gradually recovered in the ensuing 25 years, to about 30% of pre-exploitation levels. In 1995, Canada established an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and became the primary fisher of porbeagles in the region. Between 1994 and 1998, Canadian fishing vessels landed 1,000–2,000 tons per year, which depleted the population to 11–17% of pre-exploitation levels by 2000. Strict regulations and greatly reduced fishing quotas introduced in 2000 have since begun to reverse the stock decline, though recovery of the stock is projected to take decades due to the low productivity of the species. There is evidence that incidental <b>artificial</b> <b>selection</b> caused by heavy fishing has led to a compensatory growth response, i.e. faster growth and earlier maturation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>selection</b> {{demonstrates}} the diversity that can exist among organisms that share {{a relatively recent}} common ancestor. In <b>artificial</b> <b>selection,</b> humans selectively direct the breeding of one species at each generation, allowing only those organisms that exhibit desired characteristics to reproduce. These characteristics become increasingly well-developed in successive generations. <b>Artificial</b> <b>selection</b> was successful long before science discovered the genetic basis.|$|E
25|$|In <b>artificial</b> <b>selection</b> the {{new breed}} or variety that emerges is the one with random {{mutations}} attractive to humans, while in natural selection the surviving species is the one with random mutations useful to it in its non-human environment. In both natural and <b>artificial</b> <b>selection</b> the variations {{are a result of}} random mutations, and the underlying genetic processes are essentially the same. Darwin carefully observed the outcomes of <b>artificial</b> <b>selection</b> in animals and plants to form many of his arguments in support of natural selection. Much of his book On the Origin of Species was based on these observations of the many varieties of domestic pigeons arising from <b>artificial</b> <b>selection.</b> Darwin proposed that if humans could achieve dramatic changes in domestic animals in short periods, then natural selection, given millions of years, could produce the differences seen in living things today.|$|E
40|$|Crop {{domestication}} {{can serve}} as a model of plant evolutionary processes. It involves a series of selection events from standing natural variation and newly occurring mutations and combinations of mutations as a result of natural crossings in populations during local adaptation and propagation of plant lines to other cultivation areas. Our earlier identification of three functional nucleotide polymorphisms (FNPs) of distinct genes involved in the rice domestication process led us to propose a model of the japonica rice domestication process. Here, we examined three more FNPs in two domestication-related genes involved in pigment synthesis during the development of seed pericarp color (Rc and Rd) in 91 landraces (and some modern cultivars) of japonica rice collected from throughout the area of distribution of rice. These polymorphisms were assigned by using genome-wide patterns of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) and the local origins of the landraces. The results led us to infer the process of japonica rice domestication in more detail and propose a more refined model of the japonica domestication process. In this model, the critical role of the Rc FNP at an early step of the domestication process was highlighted. Independent <b>artificial</b> <b>selections</b> of two defective Rd alleles were found, suggesting a role for Rd other than in pigment synthesis during rice domestication...|$|R

25|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>selection</b> is the {{controlled}} breeding of domestic plants and animals. Humans determine which animal or plant will reproduce and {{which of the}} offspring will survive; thus, they determine which genes will {{be passed on to}} future generations. The process of <b>artificial</b> <b>selection</b> has {{had a significant impact on}} the evolution of domestic animals. For example, people have produced different types of dogs by controlled breeding. The differences in size between the Chihuahua and the Great Dane are the result of <b>artificial</b> <b>selection.</b> Despite their dramatically different physical appearance, they and all other dogs evolved from a few wolves domesticated by humans in what is now China less than 15,000years ago.|$|E
25|$|The {{diversity}} of domesticated dogs {{is an example}} of the power of <b>artificial</b> <b>selection.</b> All breeds share common ancestry, having descended from wolves. Humans selectively bred them to enhance specific characteristics, such as color and length or body size. This created a range of breeds that include the Chihuahua, Great Dane, Basset Hound, Pug, and Poodle. Wild wolves, which did not undergo <b>artificial</b> <b>selection,</b> are relatively uniform in comparison.|$|E
