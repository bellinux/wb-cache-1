5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E

Teeter—who {{also worked}} for A, at its Mooresville, North Carolina store—and his brother Paul, who was also working for A {{borrowed}} $1,700 to open Teeter's Food Mart on Main Street in Mooresville, North Carolina. A was closing their doors and agreed to lease the location to the Teeter brothers. The first Teeter Food Mart opened on July 15, 1939. Teeter's was a family-run operation as Teeter was the manager, Paul (Bill), his brother was the produce manager and Teeter's wife, Sylvia, also worked at the store. Paul's wife, Mildred, also joined the staff as bookkeeper as the Teeter stores expanded. The Teeter brothers believed in exceptional customer service, even having home delivery service. Because of their foresight of providing great customer service and only the best products, they saw sales rise quickly. Teeter based all he would do on the Golden Rule—treat others <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have them treat you.|$|E
25|$|Brake discs and pads require {{sometime}} {{to adhere}} to each other smoothly. The pads need to deposit an even transfer layer. For street and urban driving with new pads and rotors {{it is best to}} treat them as a break in period <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> a new car for 200 to 300 miles after this period the manufactures bedding procedure can be followed. This is typically some number of stops from a certain max speed to a minimum speed. For example 10 moderate stops from 60 mph to 10mph in a safe controlled environment where no hazards are present. The goal is to get the brake pads and brake discs hot. During this time it is ideal to keep the brake pressure and stops consistent without engaging the Anti lock braking system or skidding the tires. There will likely be smells and a light amount of smoke. This is normal. Once the brakes begin to suffer from fade(braking effectiveness slightly reduced) the process is complete. Continue to drive at moderate speeds to cool the brake discs and rotors avoiding the use of the brakes unless needed for emergency situations. Also take note when coming to a complete stop until everything has cooled not to hold your foot on the brakes which could create an imprint.|$|E

500|$|LaVey {{rejects the}} idea of prayer, instead urging Satanists {{to take action to}} fix a {{situation}} instead of asking for a solution.

500|$|Despite the {{critical}} acclaim, not all reviews were as positive. Claudia Puig of USA Today wrote that [...] "for {{a movie about}} the power of imagination, Bridge to Terabithia is not as clever <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> hope". Puig called the film a [...] "serviceable translation" [...] of the novel, but thought the adult characters were caricatured. The reviewer found the real-life portions of the movie were [...] "derivative and simplistic", but found Jess's emotional tumult felt [...] "powerfully authentic, and this is where the film finds its truth and soul". The Wall Street Journal critic Joe Morgenstern felt that despite the occasional misuse of enchantment—"brief spasms of overproduced fantasy"—the novel's screen adaptation was told with [...] "agreeable simplicity in between computer-generated monsters". Morgenstern was disappointed with the performances by the young members of the cast, which he described as [...] "appealing but unpolished". Morgenstern thought Csupó lacked experience directing actors, and that although Deschanel was the best adult performer, she seemed self-directed. Entertainment Weeklys Gregory Kirschling was confused by the main characters' lack of excitement towards Terabithia, and felt the film could not decide if it was [...] "a fantasy or a coming-of-age story".|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of Dallas, Jacobs' {{presented}} his initial idea again and created Knots Landing, with some alterations of his original script. In an interview, Jacobs explained: [...] " [...] Well, that's pretty good, but you know-and then {{he pulled out the}} pages that we'd left for them a few years ago on Knots Landing, or a year before on Knots, and he said, 'Is there any way we can make this a spin-off?' [...] I just took one of the couples and made it, you know, Val and Gary who had already been created on the parent series and putting them into the mix, but when you have four couples and you change one, you sort of have to change the dynamic all the way around. However, once I wrote the script, remarkably little changed from the script and the pilot <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> see it." [...] Gary Ewing was originally played by actor David Ackroyd, but Ackroyd was unable to sign on for the spin-off, and Ted Shackelford assumed the role. Initially, it was presumed that Charlene Tilton would be joining Knots Landing as Gary and Val's daughter, but the network decided to keep her on Dallas {{in order to keep the}} two shows separate. She did, however, make a guest appearance in the first season.|$|E
