40|$|An <b>automatic</b> <b>blood</b> <b>analyser,</b> Coulter Counter Model Sr(CC-SR) was {{recently}} introduced in our hospital. This blood analyser {{is able to}} provide simultaneous measurements of seven blood parameters, i. e. WBC, REC, Hgb, Hct, MCV, MCH, MCHC, and also produces the results within 40 seconds from aspiration of the sample into the instrument. The performance and precision of this blood analyser have been clitically evaluated {{by comparing the results}} obtained from the previous blood cell counter, the Coulter Counter Model Dn (CC-DN), a haemoglobinometer, and a high speed centfugal separator. The results are as follows: 1) The precision and liniarity for readings and dilutions on WBC, RBC, Hgb and Hct by the use of the CC-SR is satisfactory. 2) Good correlation between the measurements by whole blood analysis procedure and micro sample analysis procedure is recognized. 3) The amount of carryover from one sample to the next is negligible for practical purpose. 4) High correlation factors are obtained between the measurements by the CC-SR method and former methods: i. e. 0. 99 for WBC, 0. 93 for RBC, 0. 99 for Hgb and 0. 99 for Hct. 5) For these reason, {{it can be said that}} CC-SR is more useful successive instrument to measure WBC, RBC, Hgb, Hct than the CC-DN and other above mentioned instruments...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Iron {{deficiency}} anaemia (IDA) and anaemia {{of chronic}} disease (ACD) {{are common in}} elderly patients {{but there are no}} standard diagnostic criteria. The reticulocyte haemoglobin equivalent (Ret-He) is routinely measured by modern automated <b>blood</b> <b>analysers</b> and is an early indicator of iron deficiency. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether the Ret-He level as calculated by the Sysmex XE- 5000 automated <b>blood</b> <b>analyser</b> is a useful parameter for the diagnosis of IDA in a geriatric hospitalized population. METHODS: In a prospective study, blood samples were collected in 26 geriatric patients with IDA and 111 patients with ACD diagnosed according to generally accepted laboratory and clinical criteria. A blood count including Ret-He, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and standard iron parameters was performed in each patient. RESULTS: Haemoglobin, Ret-He, MCV, MCH and MCHC levels were all significantly lower in IDA as compared to ACD patients. However, the area under the curve (AUC) was greater for MCH (0. 87, 95 % CI 0. 78 - 0. 95) and MCHC (0. 86, 95 % CI 0. 76 - 0. 96) then for Ret-He (0. 828, 95 % CI 0. 73 - 0. 93) and MCV (0. 80, 95 % CI 0. 68 - 0. 91). A Ret-He cut-off value of 26 pg had a sensitivity and specificity based on its optimal combination of 85 % and 69 % respectively. CONCLUSION: Analysis of Ret-He does not perform better than the classical red cell indices such as MCH and MCHC in differentiating IDA and ACD in geriatric patients. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|To measure pH in {{platelet}} concentrates, <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysers</b> {{with different}} calibration principles may be used. In this study, variances observed in pH measurements with {{two types of}} <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysers</b> were investigated. pH was measured in crystalloid solutions (platelet additive solution (PAS-II), phosphate-buffered solutions) and two types of platelet concentrates (containing 100 % plasma, or 65 % PAS-II/ 35 % plasma) with two blood gas analysers: either using liquid and gas calibration (AVL 945), or only liquid calibration (AVL OMNI). These measurements were compared with a reference method. Especially for PAS-II, large variation in pH was observed between AVL 945, AVL OMNI and the reference method: 6. 91 +/- 0. 02, 7. 35 +/- 0. 02 and 7. 188 +/- 0. 010, respectively (mean +/- SD; n = 12, P < 0. 0001, paired t-test). A significant difference in pH was also found for platelet concentrates in 65 % PAS/ 35 % plasma (6. 88 +/- 0. 09 on AVL 945 and 7. 02 +/- 0. 09 on AVL OMNI, n = 134, P < 0. 0001). Comparison with the reference method revealed minor differences with AVL 945, whereas AVL OMNI gave a mean difference in pH of + 0. 17. Platelets in 100 % plasma revealed smaller differences (6. 93 +/- 0. 13 for AVL 945 and 6. 99 +/- 0. 13 for AVL OMNI, n = 95, P < 0. 0001).

IPF is calculated by automated hematology analysis or flow cytometry, and it is usually high in patients with rapid platelet destruction. For both MPV and IPF, standardization of cutoff is a major need. In this review, we focus the current applicability of MPV and IPF as biomarkers in patients with autoimmune diseases...|$|R

The Cell Dyn® 4000 shows different patterns of interference by infected red cells in its impedance and optical counts, and thrombocytopenia was suspected immediately.

Samples measured using the R 1000 showed a negligible decrease in the reticulocyte count over five days at room temperature, although there was evidence of continuing intracellular maturation: with thiazole orange there was an apparent increase. A practical reference range of 20 - 70 x 10 (9) /l was established from 89 normal subjects. The close correlation between the two independent estimates indicates the validity of the quantitation of the reticulocyte count and shows that automation allows significant changes within and below the normal range to be detected with a degree of reliability which was not previously possible...|$|R
