6000|$|You {{have asked}} me several times, and I am very glad you have, [...] "How do you weigh gases?" [...] I will shew you; it is very simple, and easily done. Here is a balance, and here a copper bottle, made as light as we can {{consistent}} with due strength, turned very nicely in the lathe, and made perfectly air-tight, with a stop-cock, which we can open and shut, which at present is open, and therefore allows the bottle {{to be full of}} air. I have here a nicely-adjusted balance, in which I think the bottle, in its present condition, will be balanced by the weight on the other side. And here is a pump by which we can force the air into this bottle, and with it we will force in a certain number of volumes of air, as measured by the pump. [Twenty measures were pumped in.] We will shut that in {{and put it in the}} balance. See how it sinks: it is much heavier than it was. By what? By the air that we have forced into it by the pump. There is not a greater bulk of air, but there is the same bulk of heavier air, because we have forced in air upon it. And that you may have a fair notion in your mind as to how much this air measures, here is a jar full of water. We will open that copper vessel into this jar, and let the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> to its former state. All I have to do now is to screw them tightly together, and to turn the taps, when there, you see, is the bulk of the twenty pumps of air which I forced into the bottle; and to make sure that we have been quite correct in what we have been doing, we will take the bottle again to the balance, and, if it is now counterpoised by the original weight, we shall be quite sure we have made our experiment correctly.|$|E

50|$|Ducts are {{conduits}} or passages used in heating, ventilation, and {{air conditioning}} (HVAC) to deliver and remove air. The needed airflows include, for example, supply <b>air,</b> <b>return</b> air, and exhaust air.Ducts commonly also deliver ventilation air {{as part of the}} supply air. As such, air ducts are one method of ensuring acceptable indoor air quality as well as thermal comfort.|$|E
50|$|Air {{convection}} {{heating systems}} have been in use for over a century. Older systems rely on a passive air circulation system where the greater density of cooler air causes it to sink into the furnace area below, through <b>air</b> <b>return</b> registers in the floor, and the lesser density of warmed air causes it to rise in the ductwork; the two forces acting together to drive air circulation in a system termed 'gravity-fed'. The layout of these 'octopus’ furnaces and their duct systems is optimized with various diameters of large dampered ducts.|$|E

5000|$|The wall inlets are {{connected}} to the power unit by tubes that can be run inside walls, or through vertical pipe chases, closets, the attic, basement, or the cold <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ducts (if permitted by building code). In new construction, the vacuum tubing is usually installed during a [...] "rough-in" [...] phase once the building interior framing is complete, after other in-wall utilities (e.g. plumbing, HVAC, electrical, etc.), and just before drywall, paneling, or other surface finishes are installed. Strictly speaking, vacuum tubing should probably be installed before cabling (for electric power, telephone, LAN, etc.), since routing of wiring is usually less constrained than tubing. In a similar manner to plumbing and electrical fixtures, the vacuum inlet fittings and final connections are installed in a finish phase, after the wall finishing is complete.|$|E
5000|$|Gas fired {{forced air}} {{furnaces}} have a burner in the furnace fuelled by natural gas. A blower forces cold air through a heat exchanger {{and then through}} duct-work that distributes the hot air through the building. [...] Each room will have an outlet from the duct system, often mounted in the floor or low on the wall - some rooms will also have an opening into the cold <b>air</b> <b>return</b> duct. Depending on {{the age of the}} system, forced air gas furnaces use either a pilot light or a solid state ignition system (spark or hot surface ignition) to light the natural gas burner. The natural gas is fed to buildings from a main gas line. The duct work supplying the hot air (and sometimes cool air if an AC unit is tied into the system) may be insulated. A thermostat starts and stops the furnace to regulate temperature. Large homes or commercial buildings may have multiple thermostats and heating zones, controlled by powered dampers. A digital thermostat can be programmed to activate the gas furnace at certain times. For example, a resident may want the temperature in their dwelling to rise 15 minutes before returning from work.|$|E

5000|$|Only six men {{escaped from}} the inferno that engulfed the Dennis section, {{all of whom were}} working in 29's district: Robert (Ted) Andrews, Cyril Challoner, Thomas Fisher, David Jones (the district's night shift deputy), Albert (Bert) Samuels, and Jack Samuels. Some of the group were sitting taking a mid-shift break about 300 yd north of the Clutch when the initial {{explosion}} happened. Jack Samuels, in his testimony at the inquest, described hearing a [...] "violent thud ... followed at once by dust" [...] while at the face and commenting [...] "that's the bloody bottom gone". By the [...] "bottom", Samuels clarified that he meant 14's district, which lay below them. A colleague advised them to leave the district via the [...] "wind road" [...] which was the 29's <b>air</b> <b>return</b> drift. Around 30 men working in the 29's district were also told to follow them. But as the six-man lead group went ahead attempting to fan the air to mitigate the effects of the deadly afterdamp, they soon realised the other miners had not followed them. Jack Samuels described how Jones repeatedly fell back, commenting he was [...] "done", but Samuels told him to [...] "stick it" [...] and shouldered the deputy up a ladder; Samuels was commended at the inquest for his bravery and leadership of the group. After a long and difficult escape up 1:3 gradients, several ladders, and past rockfalls, the six miners eventually rejoined the Dennis main road and met Andrew Williams, the under-manager, who along with Bonsall had immediately descended the Dennis main shaft on being notified of the explosion. Andrews collapsed at this point and was transferred to a stretcher: Jones returned with Williams towards the Clutch, while the remaining five went to the pit bottom and safety.|$|E
40|$|Cost {{reduction}} plays {{a significant}} role in the field of concentrated solar thermal energy. It is therefore essential to quantify all factors that influence the energy conversion efficiency. The <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio is a key factor for the overall efficiency of the open volumetric receiver. It is the fraction of the blown out air which is sucked in again through the solar receiver. To achieve a high receiver efficiency it is therefore important to increase the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio. Many variables such as wind speed and direction, geometry of the receiver design and operational mode influence the air flow in front of the receiver. This in turn influences the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio. It is therefore of vital importance to be able to measure the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio and furthermore visualize the air flow in front of the receiver. The <b>air</b> <b>return</b> value was prior to this work unknown on a large scale and under concentrated solar irradiation. The development of a measurement technique for the quantification of the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio with maximum accuracy is the main objective of this thesis. The second objective lies in the visualization of the returned air. This improves the understanding of the occurring flow phenomena which govern the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio. The measurement methods were developed at a lab scale, tested under operating conditions and successfully demonstrated at the solar tower Jülich. In order to measure the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio, three variants of a novel circular tracer gas measurement technique have been developed. The tracer gas is injected either continuously or intermittently into the open air system. The tracer gas is diluted by the imperfect <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio. The mole fraction of the injected noble gas helium is measured with a mass spectrometer within the air system, from which the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio is determined. A temporal resolution of 0. 5 s has been achieved. A maximal <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio of (68. 6 ± 0. 7) % with 95 % confidence interval has been measured during irradiation with concentrated sunlight at the solar tower power plant Jülich. This is higher than thepreviously assumed <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio of 60 %. This difference corresponds to a 4 − 5 % higher overall system efficiency. The return air in front of the receiver was visualized for the first time with the newly developed Induced Infrared Thermography. Hereby, carbon dioxide is added to the return air. This induces a larger amount of radiationbeing given off in the infrared region. This radiation from the return air is visualized using an infrared camera...|$|E

40|$|The <b>air</b> <b>return</b> {{ratio is}} a key factor for the overall {{efficiency}} of the open volumetric receiver concept. Although first measurements of the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio exist for smaller setups of the open volumetric receiver concept, so far no measurement of the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio has been presented for the Solar Thermal Test and Demonstration Power Plant Jülich (1. 5 MW, 10 (kg air) /s; 700 °C). This paper describes {{the application of a}} tracer gas method at the Solar Tower Jülich to determine this substantial ARR. As tracer gas the environmentally friendly helium has been chosen. The helium is injected dynamically into the circular air flow of the system and the helium mole fraction is measured using a mass spectrometer. The dynamic concentration response of the system is used to determine the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio. This dynamic method only requires one location of measurement. First measurements with this dynamic method were conducted at the Solar Tower Jülich. The ARR of STJ was measured with and without irradiation of the main receiver with high accuracy.

Lack of fresh inside the bus passenger compartment due to poor {{ventilation system}} could increase the contaminants concentration which could affect the passenger’s health. This research reports findings of field measurement on the contaminants concentration of particulate matter (PM 1) and carbon monoxide (CO) inside the passenger compartment of a university’s shuttle bus. The field measurements were conducted at the front, middle and rear locations of the passenger compartment. Measurements of PM 1 and CO were done continuously in the morning, afternoon and evening. A CFD software was employed to develop a simplified three-dimensional model of the bus passenger compartment. Velocity and temperature boundary conditions were prescribed at the air supply diffusers, {{based on the measured}} data. Meanwhile, the contaminants concentration was prescribed at the door. Flow analysis was carried out using RNG k-? turbulent model for air flow, discrete phase and species transport for contaminants. Four cases of air supply diffuser locations namely mixing ventilations (MV 3 and MV 4), mixing ventilation with displacement ventilation (MV 2 +DV) and mixing ventilation with underfloor air distribution (MV 2 +UFAD) were examined. Two cases of <b>air</b> <b>return</b> grille locations namely three <b>air</b> <b>return</b> grilles (3 RG) and four <b>air</b> <b>return</b> grilles (4 RG) were also examined in this research. It was found from the field measurement that the contaminants concentration of PM 1 and CO were high at the front location of the passenger compartment. This is due to insufficient ventilation inside the bus passenger compartment. Result of the CFD simulation shows that the MV 2 +DV, MV 2 +UFAD and 4 RG of air supply diffuser and <b>air</b> <b>return</b> grille locations could reduce the contaminants concentration of CO and PM 1 in the occupied zone inside the bus passenger compartment...|$|E
