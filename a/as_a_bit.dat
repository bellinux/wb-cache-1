5|$|James Nesbitt is {{an actor}} from Northern Ireland whose filmography {{encompasses}} both television and film roles over a 30-year period. Nesbitt's screen career {{began in the}} early 1980s with uncredited roles in episodes of the BBC Play For Today strand, which he had while attached to the Riverside Theatre's youth group. His first credited role came in 1989, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> player in the John Ogdon biopic Virtuoso, which was followed by his first feature film role in 1991 in Hear My Song.|$|E
25|$|The base-2 {{numeral system}} is a {{positional}} notation with a radix of 2. Each digit is referred to <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit.</b> Because of its straightforward implementation in digital electronic circuitry using logic gates, the binary system is used by almost all modern computers and computer-based devices.|$|E
25|$|This {{time the}} Greys {{were able to}} use a final {{appearance}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a stepping stone. In 2000-01 they earned a first-place finish {{for the first time since}} 1987 and blew past the Guelph Dominators in the quarter-finals, earning a rematch with Cambridge. The Winterhawks had finished four places and 17 points behind the Greys. That didn't stop them from dumping Owen Sound 4-2, a bitter disappointment for the favoured Greys.|$|E

25|$|When {{he first}} arrived in Paris, he wrote home {{regularly}} to his mother, he sketched his nudes at the Académie Colarossi, and he drank wine in moderation. He {{was at that time}} considered by those who knew him <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> reserved, verging on the asocial. He is noted to have commented, upon meeting Picasso who, at the time, was wearing his trademark workmen's clothes, that even though the man was a genius, that did not excuse his uncouth appearance.|$|E
25|$|The second Torneo Cibernetico match {{took place}} {{a week later}} and saw Pierrothito as {{the winner of the}} match when he outlasted Aéreo, Pequeño Halcón, Universito 2000, Astral, Último Dragóncito, Pequeño Black Warrior and Bam Bam. Pierrothito's victory was seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a surprise, first and {{foremost}} because he was a Rudo just like Demus 3:16, but also because Demus and Bam Bam, the last man eliminated by Pierrothito, was a longtime rival and had frequently talked about wanting to move up a division in various interviews.|$|E
25|$|When the Tuckers {{moved to}} St. George, Utah, Juanita took Tanya to {{audition}} for the film Jeremiah Johnson. Tanya did not win the bigger role for which she tried out, but she was hired <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> player. About this time, she also got {{one of her first}} musical breaks, when her father drove the family to Phoenix for the Arizona State Fair, on the chance that the featured performer, country singer Judy Lynn, could use Tanya in her show. Tanya sang for the fair's entertainment managers, and she was engaged to sing at the fair itself.|$|E

25|$|The lip angle {{determines the}} amount of support {{provided}} to the cutting edge. A greater lip angle will cause the bit to cut more aggressively under {{the same amount of}} point pressure <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> with a smaller lip angle. Both conditions can cause binding, wear, and eventual catastrophic failure of the tool. The proper amount of lip clearance is determined by the point angle. A very acute point angle has more web surface area presented to the work at any one time, requiring an aggressive lip angle, where a flat bit is extremely sensitive to small changes in lip angle due to the small surface area supporting the cutting edges.|$|E
25|$|Hussain was {{subsequently}} not picked {{for the next}} three years. Hussain was also regarded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a hot-head, and his fiery temper briefly jeopardised his prospects of an international career. At Essex Hussain continued to score runs and impress his county colleague and England captain Graham Gooch enough to have a Test reprieve. So at the 3rd Ashes Test of 1993, Hussain joined an England team. Hussain scored 71 and 47 not out, which was enough to see him selected {{for the rest of the}} series. It was however not enough to secure his place for the subsequent winter tour, nor for that matter the next three years of Test matches.|$|E
25|$|In 1924, with Dillon's financing, {{they went}} to Hollywood, where she became Gable's manager and first wife. He changed his stage name from W. C. Gable to Clark Gable. He found work as an extra in such silent films as Erich von Stroheim's The Merry Widow (1925), The Plastic Age (1925), which starred Clara Bow, Forbidden Paradise (1924), {{starring}} Pola Negri, plus a series of two-reel comedies called The Pacemakers. He appeared as an extra in Fox's The Johnstown Flood (1926). Seventeen-year-old Carole Lombard, later his third wife, also appeared as an extra in that film, although they {{were not in the}} same scene. He also appeared <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> player in a series of shorts.|$|E

25|$|In 1892, McCall {{was elected}} to the United States House of Representatives, a seat he would occupy for twenty years, {{generally}} winning reelection by large margins. As he had in the state legislature, he introduced a corrupt practices act into Congress. In foreign policy, he was anti-imperialist, arguing for the independence of The Philippines after the Spanish–American War, and opposed the Dingley Tariff, arguing its rates were too high. He {{was one of the few}} representatives opposed to the Hepburn Act, which enabled the Interstate Commerce Commission to regulate railroad rates. He had a reputation <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a maverick, because he often strayed from the Republican party line, but he maintained a generally conservative voting record, and introduced little new legislation.|$|E
25|$|The second work, {{targeted}} at a specialist audience, {{was not intended}} as a textbook but {{as a means to}} show Romanian grammar as it existed in reality; this was in contrast with Tiktin's 1891 teaching manual. Philippide discussed words selected from the dictionary by Alexandru Cihac, the only one he found respectable; and from writers, Moldavians especially: Ion Creangă foremost, but also Mihai Eminescu, Alexandru Odobescu, Costache Negruzzi, Petre Ispirescu, Costache Conachi and Vasile Alecsandri; and from the Moldavian chronicles, as well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of Anton Pann. The book features many examples of the spoken language, some of them in the Moldavian subdialect. He believed the examples would help illustrate the development of the language's inflection and syntax; this methodology is unique in the annals of Romanian grammar works. Here, he introduced the (debated) notion that the Romanian literary language was not based on a particular subdialect, but resulted from each one's contributions. While the Wallachian form was previously dominant, the increasing output of Moldavian writers meant that, {{by the end of the}} 19th century, the written language had become a compromise between the two.|$|E

[...] Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance came {{at a time when the}} Occupy Wall Street ongoings echoed the play while its actors could not afford the $120 ticket price.

Harrison explained: [...] "The name of the company came about <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a joke.

500|$|The San Diego Padres drafted Hamilton eighth {{overall in}} the 1991 Major League Baseball draft, making him the highest drafted Atlantic Sun Conference {{baseball}} player in the league's history. He eventually {{signed a contract with}} the Padres worth $415,000 after a short period in which Hamilton refused to sign a contract. He was surprised upon hearing of his selection, saying [...] "It came <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a shock because I really hadn't heard much from the Padres." [...] According to Hamilton's mother, Hamilton only signed the deal because his father Jack was dying of cancer, and it had been his father's dream to watch his son pitch in the major leagues. Following the draft, Hamilton joined Team USA in Canada in preparation for the Olympics.|$|E

[...] On her performance, Roger Ebert commented, [...] "Her first kiss is one of the most perfect little scenes I've ever seen in a movie." [...] For this role, Witherspoon was nominated for the Young Artist Award Best Young Actress. [...] Later that year, she made her television debut role in Wildflower with Patricia Arquette.
