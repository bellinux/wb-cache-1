5000|$|<b>Asphalt</b> {{millings}} - Small {{pieces of}} <b>asphalt</b> produced by mechanically grinding <b>asphalt</b> surfaces {{are referred to}} as <b>asphalt</b> millings. Large millings that have a rich, black tint indicating a high <b>asphalt</b> cement content are best for <b>asphalt</b> recycling purposes. Surface millings are recommended over full depth millings when choosing <b>asphalt</b> millings to recycle. Full depth millings usually contain sub-base contaminants such as gravel, mud and sand. These sub base contaminants will leach oil away from original <b>asphalt</b> and dry out the material in the recycling process. <b>Asphalt</b> milled from <b>asphalt</b> is better than <b>asphalt</b> milled from concrete. When milling <b>asphalt</b> from concrete the dust that is created is not compatible with <b>asphalt</b> products because it is not <b>asphalt.</b>|$|R

Indoor tests {{on the performance of}} binding material made of crumbed rubber particles, botanic <b>asphalt</b> and petroleum <b>asphalt</b> as well as the performance of its premix are carried out. The results show that botanic crumbed rubber <b>asphalt</b> pertables as well as <b>asphalt</b> rubber, which means botanic crumbed rubber <b>asphalt</b> can be used as binding material in road <b>asphalt</b> concrete. The study provides a theory basis for the possibility of partially replacing petroleum <b>asphalt</b> with botanic <b>asphalt.</b> Botanic <b>asphalt</b> has much higher comparative advantages than petroleum <b>asphalt</b> in the aspects of social benefit and economic benefit, so there must be a bright prospect for botanic <b>asphalt...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Work on a [...] gravel runway was {{completed}} in 1992. However, there was a power line {{just short of the}} runway which needed to be moved for the airport to receive operating permission. The airport had originally been foreseen to wavier the requirement, but after an accident where an aircraft crashed into a power line near an airport the authorities became more restrictive. Arendal and Froland Municipalities, the owners of the airport at the time, were only willing to fund the NOK352,000 cost of moving the power lines as long as the county also partially fund it. The latter rejected any responsibility, citing that the power line was municipally owned and they were having to cut back on hospital services and could not prioritize the airport. As a result, the airport was disused for more four years. Not until July 1996 did the airport reopen, after upgrades which included <b>asphalting</b> the runway.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} are to use Direct Coal Liquefaction Residue (DLCR) to modify the <b>asphalt</b> binders and mixtures and to evaluate the performance of modified <b>asphalt</b> mixtures. The dynamic modulus and phase angle of DCLR and DCLR-composite modified <b>asphalt</b> mixture were analyzed, and the viscoelastic properties of these modified <b>asphalt</b> mixtures were compared to the base <b>asphalt</b> binder SK- 90 and Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene (SBS) modified <b>asphalt</b> mixtures. The master curves of the <b>asphalt</b> mixtures were shown, and dynamic and viscoelastic behaviors of <b>asphalt</b> mixtures were described using the Christensen-Anderson-Marasteanu (CAM) model. The test {{results show that the}} dynamic moduli of DCLR and DCLR-composite <b>asphalt</b> mixtures are higher than those of the SK- 90 and SBS modified <b>asphalt</b> mixtures. Based on the viscoelastic parameters of CAM models of the <b>asphalt</b> mixtures, the high- and low-temperature performance of DLCR and DCLR-composite modified <b>asphalt</b> mixtures are obviously better than the SK- 90 and SBS modified <b>asphalt</b> mixtures.

25|$|The largest use of <b>asphalt</b> is {{for making}} <b>asphalt</b> {{concrete}} for road surfaces; this accounts for approximately 85% of the <b>asphalt</b> {{consumed in the}} United States. <b>Asphalt</b> concrete pavement mixes are typically composed of 5% <b>asphalt</b> cement and 95% aggregates (stone, sand, and gravel). Due to its highly viscous nature, <b>asphalt</b> cement must be heated {{so it can be}} mixed with the aggregates at the <b>asphalt</b> mixing facility. The temperature required varies depending upon characteristics of the <b>asphalt</b> and the aggregates, but warm-mix <b>asphalt</b> technologies allow producers to reduce the temperature required.
