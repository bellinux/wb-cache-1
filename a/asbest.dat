40|$|Abstract Background The ankyrin repeat and {{suppressor}} of cytokine signalling (SOCS) box proteins (<b>Asbs)</b> {{are a large}} protein family {{implicated in}} diverse biological processes including regulation of proliferation and differentiation. The SOCS box of <b>Asb</b> proteins is important in a ubiquitination-mediated proteolysis pathway. Here, we aimed to evaluate expression and function of human Asb- 9 (<b>ASB</b> 9). Results We found that a variant of <b>ASB</b> 9 that lacks the SOCS box (<b>ASB</b> 9 ΔSOCS) was naturally detected in human cell lines but not in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} or normal hepatocytes. We also identified ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase (uMtCK) as a new target of <b>ASB</b> 9 in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells. The ankyrin repeat domains of <b>ASB</b> 9 can associate with the substrate binding site of uMtCK in a SOCS box-independent manner. The overexpression of <b>ASB</b> 9, but not <b>ASB</b> 9 ΔSOCS, induces ubiquitination of uMtCK. <b>ASB</b> 9 and <b>ASB</b> 9 ΔSOCS can interact and colocalise with uMtCK in the mitochondria. However, only expression of <b>ASB</b> 9 induced abnormal mitochondrial structure and a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, the creatine kinase activities and cell growth were significantly reduced by <b>ASB</b> 9 but not by <b>ASB</b> 9 ΔSOCS. Conclusions <b>ASB</b> 9 interacts with the creatine kinase system and negatively regulates cell growth. The differential expression and function of <b>ASB</b> 9 and <b>ASB</b> 9 ΔSOCS may be a key factor in the growth of human cell lines and primary cells. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The coexistent {{phenomenon}} of deformed and transformed adiabatic shear bands (<b>ASBs)</b> is analyzed using Johnson-Cook model and gradient-dependent plasticity for heterogeneous ductile metal material. The size of deformed <b>ASB</b> {{is described by}} the internal length reflecting the heterogeneity of material. Microstructural effect leads to a nonuniform distribution of temperature rise in deformed <b>ASB.</b> When the peak temperature in deformed <b>ASB</b> exceeds the transformation temperature, a transformed <b>ASB</b> appears {{at the center of}} deformed <b>ASB.</b> With a decrease of flow shear stress, the width of transformed <b>ASB</b> increases until its upper bound, i. e., the size of deformed <b>ASB,</b> is reached. The effects of initial temperature and strain rate on the occurrence of transformation, evolution of the thickness of transformed <b>ASB,</b> distributions of local temperature and plastic shear deformation in <b>ASB</b> are investigated. Lower initial temperature results in higher peak shear stress, later occurrence of shear strain localization, lower shear stress when transformation occurs, later occurrence of transformation, thinner transformed <b>ASB,</b> lower peak temperature in <b>ASB,</b> and lower value of local plastic shear deformation in the boundaries of transformed <b>ASB.</b> At higher strain rates, the transformed <b>ASB</b> is wider; the peak temperature in <b>ASB</b> is higher; the value of local plastic shear deformation in the boundaries of transformed <b>ASB</b> is higher; the flow shear stress that corresponds to transformation is higher; earlier occurrence of transformation and higher peak shear stress will be expected...|$|R

40|$|Three Gram-negative, microaerophilic bacteria, strains <b>ASB</b> 1 (T), <b>ASB</b> 2 and <b>ASB</b> 3, with a corkscrew-like {{morphology}} {{isolated from}} the gastric mucosa of cats were studied using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. The isolates grew on biphasic culture plates under microaerobic conditions at 37 degrees C and exhibited urease, oxidase and catalase activities. They were also able to grow in colonies on dry agar plates. Based on 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis, <b>ASB</b> 1 (T), <b>ASB</b> 2 and <b>ASB</b> 3 were identified {{as members of the}} genus Helicobacter and showed 98 to 99 % sequence similarity to strains of Helicobacter felis, Helicobacter bizzozeronii, 'Candidatus Helicobacter heilmannii', Helicobacter cynogastricus, Helicobacter baculiformis and Helicobacter salomonis, six related Helicobacter species previously detected in feline or canine gastric mucosa. Sequencing of the partial hsp 60 gene demonstrated that <b>ASB</b> 1 (T), <b>ASB</b> 2 and <b>ASB</b> 3 constitute a separate taxon among the feline and canine Helicobacter species. The urease gene sequences of <b>ASB</b> 1 (T), <b>ASB</b> 2 and <b>ASB</b> 3 showed approximately 91 % similarity to those of 'Candidatus Helicobacter heilmannii'. Protein profiling, the absence of alkaline phosphatase activity and several other biochemical characteristics also allowed strains <b>ASB</b> 1 (T), <b>ASB</b> 2 and <b>ASB</b> 3 to be differentiated from other Helicobacter species of feline or canine gastric origin. The results of this polyphasic taxonomic study show that the cultured isolates constitute a new taxon corresponding to 'Candidatus Helicobacter heilmannii', which was previously demonstrated in the stomach of humans, wild felidae, cats and dogs.

40|$|Ankyrin repeat and {{suppressor}} of cytokine signaling box (<b>ASB)</b> protein family {{consists of}} 18 members.

Design: Prospective cross-sectional study Setting: Chahar-Mahal province, Iran Subjects and Methods: One hundred women with type 2 diabetes and 100 normal women (control) who had no abnormalities of the urinary tract were recruited. Demographic data and information regarding previous history of urinary tract infections (UTIs), duration of diabetes and presence of pyuria was collected. Baseline serum creatinine and fasting blood sugar levels (FBSL) were measured. Main outcome measure(s) : Prevalence and risk factors for <b>ASB</b> in normal and type 2 diabetic women.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Women with {{diabetes}} mellitus (DM) have asymptomatic bacteriuria (<b>ASB)</b> {{more often than}} women without DM. It is unknown, however, what the consequences of <b>ASB</b> are in these women. OBJECTIVE: To compare women with DM with and without <b>ASB</b> {{for the development of}} symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs), renal function, and secondary complications of DM during an 18 -month follow-up period. METHODS: In this multicenter study we monitored women with DM with and without <b>ASB</b> for the development of symptomatic UTIs, renal function, and secondary complications (ie, retinopathy, neuropathy, microvascular, or macrovascular diseases). Data on the first 18 -month follow-up period are presented. RESULTS: At least 1 uncontaminated urine culture was available from 636 women (258 with type 1 DM and 378 with type 2 DM). The prevalence of <b>ASB</b> at baseline was 26 % (21 % for those with type 1 DM and 29 % for those with type 2 DM). Follow-up results were available for 589 (93 %) of the 636 women. Of these 589 women, 115 (20 %) (14 % with type 1 DM and 23 % with type 2 DM) developed a symptomatic UTI. Women with type 2 DM and <b>ASB</b> at baseline had an increased risk of developing a UTI during the 18 -month follow-up (19 % without <b>ASB</b> vs 34 % with <b>ASB,</b> P =. 006). In contrast, {{there was no difference in}} the incidence of symptomatic UTI between women with type 1 DM and <b>ASB</b> and those without <b>ASB</b> (12 % with <b>ASB</b> vs 15 % without <b>ASB).</b> However, women with type 1 DM and <b>ASB</b> had a tendency to have a faster decline in renal function than those without <b>ASB</b> (relative increase in serum creatinine level 4. 6 % vs 1. 5 %, P = 0. 2).

Here, we show that <b>ASB</b> proteins interact with Cul 5 –Rbx 2 but neither Cul 2 nor Rbx 1 in cells. Mutational analysis revealed that the highly conserved amino acid sequences of the BC box and Cul 5 box in the SOCS box of <b>ASB</b> proteins were essential for the interaction with Cul 5 –Rbx 2. Although <b>ASB</b> proteins show slight divergences from the consensus sequences of the BC box and Cul 5 box, all five tested <b>ASB</b> proteins bound to Cul 5 –Rbx 2.

Previous study has demonstrated high expression level of <b>ASB</b> 4 in metastatic HCC cells, implicating the properties of <b>ASB</b> 4 in cancer invasiveness. With this hypothesis, various experiments were performed in this research project to elucidate the functional roles of <b>ASB</b> 4 in HCC cells. The aim of this study is to characterize the roles of <b>ASB</b> 4 in HCC by manipulating its expression level in HCC cell lines through gene knockdown and over-expression. Altering the level of <b>ASB</b> 4 in HCC cells resulted in no significant effects on the cell proliferation rates. However, <b>ASB</b> 4 was demonstrated to promote migration and invasion properties of HCC cells, as suppression of its level led to slower migration and made cells less invasive. Opposite effects on cell migration and invasion were observed when <b>ASB</b> 4 was ectopically expressed.
