50|$|Compared to mildly salty regular soy sauce, {{the sweet}} soy sauce has a {{slightly}} thicker consistency, and tastes much sweeter. This condiment is made from a fermented paste of boiled black soybeans, roasted grain, salt, water and Aspergillus wentii molds, to which palm sugar is added. The strong sweet taste is contributed by a generous amount of palm sugar — the sauce may contain up to 50 percent gula merah or gula jawa (palm sugar jaggery). Indonesian sweet soy sauce is often enriched with spices, including star <b>anise,</b> cinnamon, black <b>pepper,</b> coriander and clove.|$|R

40|$|The {{prevalence}} and population {{density of the}} mycobiota of 50 samples belonging to 10 kinds of spices (<b>anise,</b> black <b>pepper,</b> red pepper, black cumin, peppermint, cardamom, clove, cumin, ginger and marjoram) which collected from different places in Jeddah Governorate were studied. The natural occurrence of mycotoxins in those samples was also investigated. Fifteen genera and thirty- one species of fungi in addition to one species variety were isolated and identified during this study. The most common genera were Aspergillus, Penicillium and Fusarium. Aflatoxins (12 ~ 40 µg/kg) were detected in the extract of 5 samples of each of anise seeds and black pepper fruits; three samples of black cumin seeds and on sample only of each of peppermint and marjoram leaves out of 5 samples tested of each. Sterigmatocystin (15 ~ 20 µg/kg) was detected in some samples of red pepper, cumin and marjoram. The inhibitory effects of 10 kinds of powdered spices were tested against 3 toxigenic isolates of fungi (Aspergillus flavus, A. versicolor and Penicillium citrinum). Clove proved to be antimycotic com-pounds. It inhibited {{the growth of the}} tested toxigenic fungi. Black pepper, peppermint, cardamom, cumin and marjoram completely inhibited aflatoxins production, while black pepper and cardamom also completely inhibited sterigmatocystin pro-duction...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Antioxidant {{properties}} of green tea (GT) {{have been widely}} reported. The antioxidant capacity (AOC) of green tea was investigated to include the effect of infusion time over 24 hours. The AOC {{was measured by the}} FRAP, DPPH, TEAC, and CBA assays. It was proven according that after 2 hours of brewing, tea has higher AOC and Total phenolic content (TPC), these significantly decreases after 4 hours. GT has a high amount of polyphenols with potent AOC. However, interactions between polyphenols and food matrix may decrease their potential benefit. The objective of this experiment was to test the hypothesis that the addition of milk (full fat, semi-skimmed, and skimmed) may affect the phenolic content and AOC was measured. The results indicated the plain GT had highest activity; then tea with FFM had a significantly higher amount of AO than others. Plant extracts possess health promoting properties. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the TPC and AOA of different concentrations of spice extracts (fennel, clove, cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, <b>anise,</b> and black <b>pepper)</b> with DPPH, TEAC and Rancimat methods. At low concentration, black pepper had a highest activity but at high concentration, ginger showed the highest activity among the extracts. The TPC for spice extract was greater for anise. Results provided evidence that the studied spices may be used as a natural AO. In recent decades, saliva has emerged as a new way to diagnose and investigate basic health problems. In this study, salivary TPC and AOC were measured after consumption a single cup of green tea with and without of milk. In a healthy adult crossover design. The salivary AOC and TPC were measured before and after consumption up to 3 hours. Results indicated that milk decreased AOC of GT when compared with the control water. The activity reached peak 1 hour after ingestion and then decreased returning to the baseline. Results confirmed that saliva could be used as an easier and safer alternative to blood to assess AOA in humans...|$|R
