500|$|Speaking to The Times {{about the}} ending of the show in 1989, Curtis hinted that the {{collaborative}} writing process caused tensions amongst the cast: [...] "Everybody on the show thinks they can put in good jokes, despite the fact that Ben Elton <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> already quite a few good ones in there to start with. It does usually end up funnier, but it's time to do something over which I have more control." [...] Twenty years on, Curtis recalled in the documentary Blackadder Rides Again that: [...] "They would literally sit around for the entire time discussing the script...sometimes we would just say to them [...] "if you stood up and tried to act this script out, you would find out things about it." [...] Ben Elton stated that by opening it up, they allowed the cast to question every aspect of the script.|$|E
2500|$|The {{death penalty}} was a notable issue during the 1988 presidential election. It {{came up in}} the October 13, 1988, debate between the two presidential nominees George H. W. Bush and Michael Dukakis, when Bernard Shaw, the {{moderator}} of the debate, asked Dukakis, [...] "Governor, if Kitty Dukakis [...] were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?" [...] Dukakis replied, [...] "No, I don't, and I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life. I don't see any evidence that it's a deterrent, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime." [...] Bush was elected, and many, including Dukakis himself, cite the statement as {{the beginning of the end}} of his campaign.|$|E
2500|$|Chomsky {{supports}} the Tamils' {{right to self-determination}} in Tamil Eelam, their homeland in the North and East of Sri Lanka. In a February 2009 interview, {{he said of the}} Tamil Eelam struggle: [...] "Parts of Europe, for example, are moving towards more federal arrangements. In Spain, for example, Catalonia by now has a high degree of autonomy within the Spanish state. The Basque Country also has a high degree of autonomy. In England, Wales and Scotland in the United Kingdom are moving towards a form of autonomy and self-determination <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> similar developments throughout Europe. Though [...] they're mixed with a lot of pros and cons, but by and large I think it is a generally healthy development. I mean, the people have different interests, different cultural backgrounds, different concerns, and there should be special arrangements to allow them to pursue their special interests and concerns in harmony with others." ...|$|E

I'm not strait-laced, but I am a clergyman's son, you know, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some things which are quite beyond the pale. I only thank God that I found him out before it was too late, for he was to have married into my family." ...|$|E

60|$|Poetry, {{with all}} its obscurity, has a more general, {{as well as a}} more powerful, {{dominion}} over the passions, than the other art. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> reasons in nature, why the obscure idea, when properly conveyed, should be more affecting than the clear. It is our ignorance of things that causes all our admiration, and chiefly excites our passions. Knowledge and acquaintance make the most striking causes affect but little. It is thus with the vulgar; and all men are as the vulgar in what they do not understand. The ideas of eternity and infinity, are among the most affecting we have: and yet perhaps there is nothing of which we really understand so little, as of infinity and eternity.|$|E

6000|$|... "I do {{not turn}} from you at all," [...] she said, {{speaking}} very carefully. [...] "I {{will ever be}} grateful to my friend that was good to me; I will ever be his friend in all that I am able. But now that my father James More is come again, {{there is a difference}} to be made, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some things said and done that would be better to be forgotten. But I will ever be your friend in all that I am able, and if that is not all that [...] . if it is not so much. [...] . Not that you will be caring! But I would not have you think of me too hard. It was true what you said to me, that I was too young to be advised, and I am hoping you will remember I was just a child. I would not like to lose your friendship, at all events." ...|$|E
6000|$|And here, if Mr. Harley {{has still}} any enemies left, whom his blood spilt {{in the public}} service cannot reconcile, I hope they will at least admire his magnanimity, which is a quality esteemed even in an enemy: <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> few greater {{instances}} of it {{to be found in}} story. After the wound was given, he was observed neither to change his countenance, nor discover any concern or disorder in his speech: he rose up, and walked along the room while he was able, with the greatest tranquillity, during the midst of the confusion. When the surgeon came, he took him aside, and desired he would inform him freely whether the wound were mortal, because in that case, he said, he had some affairs to settle, relating to his family. The blade of the penknife, broken by the violence of the blow against a rib, within a quarter of an inch of the handle, was dropt out (I know not whether from the wound, or his clothes) as the surgeon was going to dress him; he ordered it to be taken up, and wiping it himself, gave it some body to keep, saying, he thought [...] "it now properly belonging to him." [...] He shewed no sort of resentment, or spoke one violent word against Guiscard, but appeared all the while the least concerned of any in the company--a state of mind, which in such an exigency, nothing but innocence can give, and is truly worthy of a Christian philosopher.|$|E
6000|$|... 'To {{return to}} Lucy Bertram. No, my dearest Matilda, she can never, never rival {{you in my}} regard, so that all your affectionate jealousy on that account is without foundation. She is, to be sure, a very pretty, a very sensible, a very affectionate girl, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> few persons to whose consolatory {{friendship}} I could have recourse more freely in what are called the real evils of life. But then these so seldom come in one's way, and one wants a friend who will sympathise with distresses of sentiment {{as well as with}} actual misfortune. Heaven knows, and you know, my dearest Matilda, that these diseases of the heart require the balm of sympathy and affection as much as the evils of a more obvious and determinate character. Now Lucy Bertram has nothing of this kindly sympathy, nothing at all, my dearest Matilda. Were I sick of a fever, she would sit up night after night to nurse me with the most unrepining patience; but with the fever of the heart, which my Matilda has soothed so often, she has no more sympathy than her old tutor. And yet what provokes me is, that the demure monkey actually has a lover of her own, and that their mutual affection (for mutual I take it to be) {{has a great deal of}} complicated and romantic interest. She was once, you must know, a great heiress, but was ruined by the prodigality of her father and the villainy of a horrid man in whom he confided. And one of the handsomest young gentlemen in the country is attached to her; but, as he is heir to a great estate, she discourages his addresses on account of the disproportion of their fortune.|$|E
2500|$|Rep. Coutu stated, [...] "... {{the unions}} {{are the first}} ones to say, 'just let us vote' and today, for some reason, they won't let these good people vote <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is {{something}} wrong with that. You can't have it both ways." ...|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the season}} finale aired, Adelstein said in a TV Guide article that, [...] "There's a cliff-hanger to Kellerman's story line in the finale, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> will be some passionate {{discussion}} about exactly what happened. It's not really ambiguous, but it's still open to various interpretations." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> that he {{committed}} suicide. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>there's</b> a smoking gun. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there's</b> {{only one way}} you can explain {{a lot of things}} around his death. Not that he was murdered, but that there was just a lack of caring for him. <b>I</b> just <b>think</b> that Courtney had moved on, and he was expendable.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Moderator," [...] Putney called sharply, {{from his}} place, [...] "this is {{altogether}} unparliamentary. That resolution is properly before the meeting. Its adoption {{has been moved}} and seconded, and it cannot be withdrawn without leave granted {{by a vote of}} the meeting. I wish to discuss the resolution in all its bearings, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> a great many present who share with me a desire to know how far it represents the sense of this society. I don't mean as to the supposed personal reflections which it was intended to punish; that is a very small matter, and as compared with the other questions involved, of no consequence whatever." [...] Putney tossed his head with insolent pleasure in his contempt of Gerrish. His nostrils swelled, and he closed his little jaws with a firmness that made his heavy black moustache hang down below the corners of his chin. He went on with a wicked twinkle in his eye, and a look all round to see that people were waiting to take his next point. [...] "I judge my old friend Brother Gerrish by myself. My old friend Gerrish cares no more really about personal allusions than I do. What he really had at heart in offering his resolution was not any supposed attack upon himself or his shop from the pulpit of this church. He cared no more for that than I should care for a reference to my notorious habits. These are things that we feel may be safely left to the judgment, the charitable judgment, of the community, which will be equally merciful to the man who devours widows' houses and to the man who 'puts an enemy in his mouth to steal away his brains.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|On {{this the}} Abbé du Bos founds a criticism, wherein he gives {{painting}} the preference to poetry {{in the article}} of moving the passions; principally {{on account of the}} greater clearness of the ideas it represents. I believe this excellent judge was led into this mistake (if it be a mistake) by his system; to which he found it more conformable than I imagine it will be found to experience. I know several who admire and love painting, and yet who regard the objects of their admiration in that art with coolness enough in comparison of that warmth with which they are animated by affecting pieces of poetry or rhetoric. Among the common sort of people, I never could perceive that painting had much influence on their passions. It is true that the best sorts of painting, as well as the best sorts of poetry, are not much understood in that sphere. But it is most certain that their passions are very strongly roused by a fanatic preacher, or by the ballads of Chevy Chase, or the Children in the Wood, and by other little popular poems and tales that are current in that rank of life. I do not know of any paintings, bad or good, that produce the same effect. So that poetry, with all its obscurity, has a more general, as well as a more powerful dominion over the passions, than the other art. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> reasons in nature, why the obscure idea, when properly conveyed, should be more affecting than the clear. It is our ignorance of things that causes all our admiration, and chiefly excites our passions. Knowledge and acquaintance make the most striking causes affect but little. It is thus with the vulgar; and all men are as the vulgar in what they do not understand. The ideas of eternity, and infinity, are among the most affecting we have: and yet perhaps there is nothing of which we really understand so little, as of infinity and eternity. We do not anywhere meet a more sublime description than this justly-celebrated one of Milton, wherein he gives the portrait of Satan with a dignity so suitable to the subject: ...|$|E
5000|$|Regarding the {{influences}} of China's political upheavals on his paintings, Zhang said, [...] "For me, the Cultural Revolution is a psychological state, not a historical fact. It has a very strict connection with my childhood, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> many things linking {{the psychology of the}} Chinese people today with the psychology of the Chinese people back then." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{regard to}} the Western matter, I believe the program will have to stand {{substantially}} as I first put it. Henderson, and especially Brown, believe that the social influence of St. Louis would inevitably tell injuriously upon General Pope in the particular difficulty existing <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is some force in that view.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] she said, [...] "there {{were little}} courtesies shown us at Las Palmas, {{things that made}} our stay <b>there</b> pleasanter, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> was, perhaps, no great reason why you should have done them for my father."

5000|$|Though it {{was very}} {{strongly}} reviewed with many critics calling {{it one of the}} best Korean films of 2012, its subject matter is believed to have intimidated many viewers, resulting in low box office returns.

5000|$|Geddy Lee {{mentioned}} this song {{in a somewhat}} unfavorable light in this interview excerpt from the book Contents Under Pressure: [...] "song was just something we had to do. But it's kind of absurd. I mean, it's just where we were at. We were a young band, a little pretentious, full of ambitions, full of grand ideas, {{and we wanted to}} see if we could make some of those grand ideas happen. And 'Fountain of Lamneth' was the first attempt to do that. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some beautiful moments, but a lot of it is ponderous and off the mark. It's also the most time we ever had to make a record. I think we had a full three weeks, and we were just indulging ourselves.'" ...|$|E
