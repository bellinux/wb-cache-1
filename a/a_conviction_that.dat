5|$|Paine's creed encapsulates many of {{the major}} themes {{of the rest of}} his text: a firm belief in a creator-God; a {{skepticism}} regarding most supernatural claims (here the afterlife, later in the text, miracles); <b>a</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> virtues should be derived from a consideration for others rather than oneself; an animus against corrupt religious institutions; and an emphasis on the individual's right of conscience.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher Taede Smedes {{argued that}} {{religious}} language is symbolic. Denying any conflict {{between science and}} religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept <b>a</b> <b>conviction</b> (<b>that</b> God exists, {{in the context of}} Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not know for sure. Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world {{that there can be no}} common standard to which both God and the world can be compared. He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently). Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God pro nobis (for us) and not in se (as such) or sine nobis (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.|$|E

25|$|Political Islam {{consists}} of {{a broad array of}} mass movements in the Muslim world, which share <b>a</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> political power is an essential instrument for constructing a God-fearing society. They believe that Muslims can fulfill their religious obligations only when public law sanctions and encourages pious behavior. To this end, the majority of these movements work to take control of state power, whether by propaganda, plebiscite, or putsch.|$|E
25|$|I {{hope the}} discussions {{outlined}} {{in these pages}} {{have shown that the}} data of anthropology teach us a greater tolerance of forms of civilization different from our own, that we should learn to look on foreign races with greater sympathy and with <b>a</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that,</b> as all races have contributed in the past to cultural progress in one way or another, so they will be capable of advancing the interests of mankind if we are only willing to give them a fair opportunity.|$|E

25|$|Tillemont and Le Beau {{regard the}} revolt of Illus {{as an attempt}} to re-establish paganism; but for this view there seems no foundation. We do not know that Illus was a pagan, though Pamprepius was one: {{it is more likely that}} Illus was a man of no fixed {{religious}} principles, and that his revolt originated either in ambition, or in <b>a</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> his only prospect of safety from the intrigues of his enemies and the suspicions of Zeno was the dethronement of the emperor. It is remarkable that Edward Gibbon does not mention the name of Illus, and scarcely notices his revolt.|$|E
25|$|In 1837, Parker {{had begun}} {{attending}} {{meetings of the}} group later known as the Transcendental Club. Ralph Waldo Emerson’s Divinity School Address that year had been deeply arresting to him, and he welcomed the opportunity to associate with Emerson, Amos Bronson Alcott, Orestes Brownson, and several others. Transcendentalists such as Henry David Thoreau and Parker wrote {{of the world as}} divine, and of themselves as part of this divinity. Unlike Emerson and other Transcendentalists, however, Parker believed the movement was rooted in deeply religious ideas and did not believe it should retreat from religion. All shared <b>a</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> slavery should be abolished and social reforms should take root.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{research}} has shown that fusion could also be a strong predictor of group-directed helping behaviors. In some studies, individuals donated money to the group. In others, they provided social and emotional support to fellow group members. Other {{research has}} also suggested that strongly fused individuals are especially willing to {{go out of their way}} to protect the group and maintain its integrity. For instance, strongly fused employees were more likely to report having “blown the whistle” sometime during their employment. Presumably, such whistle-blowing activity was motivated by <b>a</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> their actions would ultimately benefit the group. Another study found that students who were strongly fused with their university were willing to whistle-blow against a cheating fellow student despite the cost of time, energy, and the possibility of retaliation from the cheater.|$|E

500|$|Although he {{presented}} himself in an autocratic manner in several speeches, Mandela was a devout believer in democracy and abided by majority decisions even when deeply disagreeing with them. He had exhibited {{a commitment to}} the values of democracy and human rights since at least the 1960s. He held <b>a</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> [...] "inclusivity, accountability and freedom of speech" [...] were the fundamentals of democracy, and was driven by a belief in natural and human rights. Suttner argued that there were [...] "two modes of leadership" [...] that Mandela adopted.

500|$|In the Bloom's Shakespeare Through the Ages {{volume on}} Hamlet, editors Bloom and Foster express <b>a</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> the {{intentions}} of Shakespeare in portraying the character of Hamlet in the play exceeded {{the capacity of the}} Freudian Oedipus complex to completely encompass the extent of characteristics depicted in Hamlet throughout the tragedy: [...] "For once, Freud regressed in attempting to fasten the Oedipus Complex upon Hamlet: it will not stick, and merely showed that Freud did better than T.S. Eliot, who preferred Coriolanus to Hamlet, or so he said. Who can believe Eliot, when he exposes his own Hamlet Complex by declaring the play to be an aesthetic failure?" [...] The book also notes James Joyce's interpretation, stating that he [...] "did far better in the Library Scene of Ulysses, where Stephen marvelously credits Shakespeare, in this play, with universal fatherhood while accurately implying that Hamlet is fatherless, thus opening a pragmatic gap between Shakespeare and Hamlet." ...|$|E
500|$|The Emperor's more notable {{political}} successes {{were achieved}} {{primarily because of}} the non-confrontational and cooperative manner with which he approached both issues and the partisan figures with whom he had to deal. He was remarkably tolerant, seldom taking offense at criticism, opposition or even incompetence. He did not have the constitutional authority to force acceptance of his initiatives without support, and his collaborative approach towards governing kept the nation progressing and enabled the political system to successfully function. The Emperor respected the prerogatives of the legislature, even when they resisted, delayed, or thwarted his goals and appointments. Most politicians appreciated and supported his role. Many had lived through the regency period, when the lack of an emperor who could stand above petty and special interests led to years of strife between political factions. Their experiences in public life had created <b>a</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> PedroII was [...] "indispensable to Brazil's continued peace and prosperity." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{vigorous}} recruiting campaign involving pre-war personalities such as Lord Kitchener and Lord Derby {{facilitated the}} {{rapid expansion of}} the British Army. Territorial units formed duplicate battalions from August 1914 to May 1915. To differentiate them, they were, for instance, designated the 2/5th and 3/5th battalions, respectively. Second-line battalions had been raised for home service and recruit training, but were ultimately dispatched to the Western Front and replaced by the third-line. Driven by <b>a</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> the war would not be resolved quickly and seeking an alternative to the Territorial Army, Secretary of State for War Lord Kitchener appealed for an initial 100,000 volunteers to form a [...] "New Army". The 17th Earl of Derby proposed forming a battalion of [...] "Pals" [...] for the King's Regiment, to be recruited from men of the same workplace. His proposal proved successful. Within a week, thousands of Liverpudlians had volunteered for service, to eventually be formed into the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th Battalions. Collectively, the battalions became known as the City of Liverpool battalions or [...] "Liverpool Pals". Lord Derby addressed recruits on 28 August: ...|$|E
