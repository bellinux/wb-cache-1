Veld on September 9, 1906, in time for High Holy Day services to be held there that year. The <b>actual</b> <b>cost</b> of construction was around $60,000 (today $), of which $35,000 (today $) was raised through sale of seats and donations, and the rest via a mortgage. The improved premises attracted many new members.|$|E

Schmittou looked to local suppliers to donate construction materials, took out a $30,000 loan from a bank, sold season tickets, and even mortgaged his own home {{to help pay for}} the stadium. The ballpark would be named Herschel Greer Stadium in posthumous honor of Herschel Lynn Greer, a prominent Nashville businessman and the first president of the Nashville Vols baseball team, whose family donated $25,000 for stadium construction.|$|E
5|$|The {{fountain}} looks unfinished, like concrete {{that has}} not been completely mixed. Up close, it is very rough and textured. There are several square pillars or cubed tubes that form a semi circle inside a pentagon shaped pool. The natural colored pillars jut out and crisscross from the corner of the plaza “like the tentacles of some immense geometrical octopus….breaking open.” There are two bridges, or walk ways (with stairs), that allow the public to stand in-between the tubes and have a view overlooking the plaza and city. A series of platforms at pool level permit pedestrian entry into the fountain and behind the falling water. The fountain and plaza are easily accessible to the public at all times and in all conditions, rain or shine. The fountain's budget was US$310,000, and it was dedicated on April 22, 1971. The Los Angeles Times reported that its <b>actual</b> <b>cost</b> was US$607,800.|$|E

5|$|A {{short run}} of Gran Trak systems was {{produced}} in March 1974 and revealed other design problems, such as the steering controls; in their prototype system, Eigen used real a real car steering wheel and pedals, but the production run used different parts. Alcorn returned to Cyan that month and redesigned the game to fix the flaws and use more standard parts; the copying protection scheme was changed to use a custom-designed integrated circuit that was named {{the same as a}} standard Texas Instruments integrated circuit. Alcorn later stated in an interview that neither Warman nor Emmons understood the challenges in converting a prototype design to a product that could be manufactured. The game entered production soon after, and Atari announced it was shipping a full production run in May 1974. Although the design flaws were fixed, the communication problems during development led to one final problem with the game: Atari was unclear on the <b>actual</b> <b>cost</b> of producing the game. As a result, a single Gran Trak game ended up costing US$1,095 to manufacture, while Atari was selling them to distributors for only $995, losing $100 per sale. Atari soon corrected the problem, but ended the fiscal year with a large loss {{due in part to the}} financial failure of the game.|$|E
5|$|Before 2009, members {{received}} the same salary as members of their national parliament. However, from 2009 a new members statute came into force, after years of attempts, which gave all members an equal monthly pay, of 8,020.53 euro each in 2014, subject to a European Union tax and which can also be taxed nationally. MEPs {{are entitled to a}} pension, paid by Parliament, from the age of 63. Members are also entitled to allowances for office costs and subsistence, and travelling expenses, based on <b>actual</b> <b>cost.</b> Besides their pay, members are granted a number of privileges and immunities. To ensure their free movement to and from the Parliament, they are accorded by their own states the facilities accorded to senior officials travelling abroad and, by other state governments, the status of visiting foreign representatives. When in their own state, they have all the immunities accorded to national parliamentarians, and, in other states, they have immunity from detention and legal proceedings. However, immunity cannot be claimed when a member is found committing a criminal offence and the Parliament also has the right to strip a member of their immunity.|$|E

5|$|After the {{abandonment}} of Rochester's first castle it was replaced by another on the current site, in the south-west corner of the town walls. Founded between 1087 and 1089, {{some parts of the}} castle survive although it has been much altered by use and reuse in subsequent centuries. William the Conqueror had granted Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, the manor of Haddenham in Buckinghamshire– which as of the Domesday Survey had an annual income of £40– for the duration of his life. In turn, the archbishop had granted the manor to Rochester's monks, so on the Conqueror's death Lanfranc and Gundulf, who was appointed Bishop of Rochester in 1077, had to appeal for reconfirmation of the original grant from the new king. William Rufus demanded £100 in exchange for confirmation of the grant. The two bishops felt such a sum was beyond their means and sought a compromise. Instead it was agreed that Gundulf would build a new stone castle at Rochester. Initially the two bishops were concerned that the cost would exceed the king's original request and that they would be responsible for the castle's upkeep. However Henry, Earl of Warwick, convinced them that a castle suitable for the king could be constructed for £40 and that following its completion the castle would be handed over to someone else. The <b>actual</b> <b>cost</b> to Gundulf was £60. The bishop was a skilled architect and supervised the construction of the Tower of London's eponymous White Tower on behalf of William the Conqueror. Gundulf's castle was adjacent to Rochester Cathedral. According to archaeologist Oliver Creighton, when castles were positioned close to churches or cathedrals it suggested a link between the two, and in this case both were owned by the Bishop of Rochester. Often the same craftsmen and architects would work on these closely related buildings, leading to similarities in some of their features. Along with Durham and Old Sarum, Rochester {{is one of the best}} examples of a closely linked castle and religious building.|$|E

40|$|Backgrounds and Aim: One of the {{remuneration}} methods {{in the hospital}} system in Iran is per case, based on a classification system termed Global system (GS). The GS, supported by Irans Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME), was established in 1999 and is now used for cost reimbursement in the second- and third-levels of health care services. In this system, patients are classified into 60 categories, based on the most frequent surgical operations. However, it now appears, {{that there are many}} questions about this system. This study aims to compare the global operations reimbursement rates with <b>actual</b> <b>costs</b> in the Cancer Institute, Tehran, in 2003 and 2004. nMaterials and Methods: This survey was a retrospective, analytical-descriptive one aiming at comparing the global operations reimbursement rates with <b>actual</b> <b>costs</b> in 646 global operations carried out in the Cancer Institute in 2003 and 2004. The global-operations and actual-costs data were gathered from Hospital Information Systems (HIS) and High Council of Insurance annual regulations, respectively, and analyzed using SPSS 11. 5 software and the Wilcoxon non-parametric test. Results: The differences between the cost reimbursement rates of global operations and their <b>actual</b> <b>costs</b> were lower in 2004 as compared to those in 2003. Also, the <b>actual</b> <b>costs</b> of operations were higher than the global operations reimbursement rates in both years and the difference was significant statistically in either year (P< 0 / 001). Conclusion: Some of the MOHME and Cancer Institutes authorities and experts believe that the decrease in differences between the cost reimbursement rates of global operations and their <b>actual</b> <b>costs</b> in 2003 compred to 2004 is due to increased awareness of physicians and the accounting and discharge units personnel of the global operations and related regulations, as well as increasing global operations reimbursement rates. Also, they believe that the differences between the global operations reimbursement rates and their <b>actual</b> <b>costs</b> in either year could be attributed to not considering the actual inflation rate, hospital types, patients co-morbidities, etc. in calculating the global operations reimbursement rates. It is suggested to make more realistic calculations, taking into account such variables as the actual inflation rate, hospital types, patient co-morbidities, etc...|$|R

25|$|Discounting {{began in}} the 1970s and was {{dramatically}} expanded in the 1990s, according to one report. Discrepancy between sticker and average net prices can vary substantially. Estimates vary, but show a consistent pattern of sticker prices being much greater than real costs, sometimes more than double, sometimes only {{one and a half}} times as high. Estimates are that 88% or 67% get some form of discount. One estimate in 2015 was that at private nonprofit four-year colleges, the average first-year student pays 48% less than the sticker price. Generally, the sticker-to-net price discrepancy is greater at private colleges than public universities. For example, in 2011–2012, the average sticker price for tuition, fees and living expenses at private colleges, was $38,590 while the average <b>actual</b> <b>cost</b> was $23,060; at public colleges, the average sticker price was $17,130 and the average <b>actual</b> <b>cost</b> was $11,380. Another estimate was that the average full-time undergraduate gets $6,500 in grant aid along with $1,000 in tax-based aid to offset tuition and fees. There is widespread consensus that the most cost-effective college option is community colleges, which charge on average only $3,000 for full-time tuition.|$|E
