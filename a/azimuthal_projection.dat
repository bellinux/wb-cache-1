50|$|The Wiechel {{projection}} is an azimuthal, equal-area projection, and {{a novelty}} map presented by William H. Wiechel in 1879. It {{is also a}} modified <b>azimuthal</b> <b>projection.</b> Distortion of direction, shape, and distance is considerable in the edges.|$|E
2500|$|Some <b>azimuthal</b> <b>projections</b> {{are true}} {{perspective}} projections; that is, {{they can be}} constructed mechanically, projecting {{the surface of the}} Earth by extending lines from a point of perspective (along an infinite line through the tangent point and the tangent point's antipode) onto the plane: ...|$|R
50|$|Some {{forms of}} the {{projection}} were known to the Greeks and Egyptians 2,000 years ago. It was studied by several French and British scientists in the 18th and 19th centuries. But the projection had little practical value; computationally simpler nonperspective <b>azimuthal</b> <b>projections</b> could be used instead.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>azimuthal</b> {{equidistant}} <b>projection</b> is an <b>azimuthal</b> map <b>projection.</b> It has {{the useful}} properties that all {{points on the}} map are at proportionately correct distances from the center point, and that all points on the map are at the correct azimuth (direction) from the center point. A useful application {{for this type of}} projection is a polar projection which shows all meridians (lines of longitude) as straight, with distances from the pole represented correctly. The flag of the United Nations contains an example of a polar <b>azimuthal</b> equidistant <b>projection.</b>|$|R
50|$|Researchers in {{structural}} geology use the Lambert <b>azimuthal</b> <b>projection</b> to plot crystallographic axes and faces, lineation and foliation in rocks, slickensides in faults, {{and other}} linear and planar features. In this context the projection {{is called the}} equal-area hemispherical projection. There is also an equal-angle hemispherical projection defined by stereographic projection.|$|E
50|$|Thus the Lambert <b>azimuthal</b> <b>projection</b> lets us plot {{directions}} as {{points in}} a disk. Due to the equal-area property of the projection, one can integrate over regions of the real projective plane (the space of directions) by integrating over the corresponding regions on the disk. This is useful for statistical analysis of directional data.|$|E
50|$|To {{define the}} Lambert <b>azimuthal</b> <b>projection,</b> imagine a plane set tangent to the sphere {{at some point}} S on the sphere. Let P be any point on the sphere other than the antipode of S. Let d be the {{distance}} between S and P in three-dimensional space (not the distance along the sphere surface). Then the projection sends P to a point P′ on the plane that is a distance d from S.|$|E
3000|$|Actually, {{there are}} several {{one-to-one}} projections to map points on a sphere to points in the plane. Besides stereographic projections (Figures 2 (a) and 2 (b)), there are area-preserving map projections, such as the Lambert <b>azimuthal</b> equal-area <b>projection.</b> As shown in Figure 2 (c), Lambert <b>azimuthal</b> equal-area <b>projection</b> maps [...]...|$|R

50|$|An orthographic {{projection}} map is a map projection of cartography. Like the stereographic projection and gnomonic projection, {{orthographic projection}} is a perspective (or <b>azimuthal)</b> <b>projection,</b> {{in which the}} sphere is projected onto a tangent plane or secant plane. The point of perspective for the orthographic projection is at infinite distance. It depicts a hemisphere of the globe as it appears from outer space, where the horizon is a great circle. The shapes and areas are distorted, particularly near the edges.|$|E
5000|$|As {{defined in}} the {{preceding}} section, the Lambert <b>azimuthal</b> <b>projection</b> of the unit sphere is undefined at (0, 0, 1). It sends {{the rest of the}} sphere to the open disk of radius 2 centered at the origin (0, 0) in the plane. It sends the point (0, 0, −1) to (0, 0), the equator z = 0 to the circle of radius [...] centered at (0, 0), and the lower hemisphere z < 0 to the open disk contained in that circle.|$|E
50|$|The Lambert <b>azimuthal</b> <b>{{projection}}</b> {{is used as}} a {{map projection}} in cartography. For example, the National Atlas of the US uses a Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection to display information in the online Map Maker application, and the European Environment Agency recommends its usage for European mapping for statistical analysis and display. It is also used in scientific disciplines such as geology for plotting the orientations of lines in three-dimensional space. This plotting is aided by a special kind of graph paper called a Schmidt net.|$|E

Based on the equatorial {{form of the}} <b>azimuthal</b> equidistant <b>projection,</b> Aitoff first halves longitudes, then projects according to the azimuthal equidistant, and then stretches the result horizontally into a 2:1 ellipse to compensate for having halved the longitudes. Expressed simply: ...|$|R

50|$|Not only lines {{but also}} planes through the origin can be plotted with the Lambert <b>azimuthal</b> <b>projection.</b> A plane intersects the {{hemisphere}} {{in a circular}} arc, called the trace of the plane, which projects down to a curve (typically non-circular) in the disk. One can plot this curve, or one can alternatively replace the plane with the line perpendicular to it, called the pole, and plot that line instead. When many planes are being plotted together, plotting poles instead of traces produces a less cluttered plot.|$|E

The Lone Sailor—a tribute to all personnel of the sea services—overlooks the Granite Sea, a map depicting the world's oceans, using an <b>azimuthal</b> <b>projection</b> centered on Washington, DC. Surrounding the Granite Sea are two fountain pools, honoring the personnel of the American Navy and the other navies of the world. The southern hemisphere of the Granite Sea is surrounded by 26 bronze high reliefs commemorating events, personnel, and communities of the various sea services.|$|E
50|$|The globe {{used in the}} {{original}} design was an <b>azimuthal</b> <b>projection</b> focused on the North Pole with North America and the United States, the host nation of the conference, at the bottom center. The projection used cut off portions of the Southern Hemisphere at the latitude of Argentina which was acceptable as Argentina was not then {{a member of the}} United Nations. The final design used in the modern logo includes all of South America and Antarctica and was rotated 90 degrees to place Europe at the bottom center.|$|E

5000|$|A {{direction}} in three-dimensional space {{corresponds to a}} line through the origin. The set of all such lines is itself a space, called the real projective plane in mathematics. Every line through the origin intersects the unit sphere in exactly two points, {{one of which is}} on the lower hemisphere z ≤ 0. (Horizontal lines intersect the equator z = 0 in two antipodal points. It is understood that antipodal points on the equator represent a single line. See quotient topology.) Hence the directions in three-dimensional space correspond (almost perfectly) to points on the lower hemisphere. The hemisphere can then be plotted as a disk of radius [...] using the Lambert <b>azimuthal</b> <b>projection.</b>|$|E
50|$|Displacement can be {{employed}} when 2 objects are so {{close to each other}} that they would overlap at smaller scales. A common place where this would occur is the cities Brazzaville and Kinshasa {{on either side of the}} Congo river in Africa. They are both the capital city of their country and on overview maps they would be displayed with a slightly larger symbol than other cities. Depending on the scale of the map the symbols would overlap. By displacing both of them away from the river (and away from their true location) the symbol overlap can be avoided. Another common case is when a road and a railroad run parallel to each other. this is mostly adopted using the <b>azimuthal</b> <b>projection</b> method.|$|E
5000|$|The {{blue that}} appears in the {{background}} of the insignia was chosen to be [...] "the opposite of red, the war colour", although the exact shade has never been officially specified by the United Nations. The original colour the group chose in 1945 was a gray blue that differs from the current United Nations flag. The globe used in the original design was an <b>azimuthal</b> <b>projection</b> focused on the North Pole with the United States, the host nation of the conference, at the centre. The projection that was used cut off portions of the Southern Hemisphere at the latitude of Argentina, which was acceptable at the time, as Argentina was not planned to be an original member of the United Nations. The projection was later altered so that no country will be at prominence within the flag. The new logo was now designed so that the globe is bisected in the centre by the Prime Meridian and the International Date Line.|$|E

50|$|The spherical mapping {{suffers from}} {{limitations}} that {{detract from the}} realism of resulting renderings. Because spherical maps are stored as <b>azimuthal</b> <b>projections</b> of the environments they represent, an abrupt point of singularity (a “black hole” effect) is visible in the reflection on the object where texel colors {{at or near the}} edge of the map are distorted due to inadequate resolution to represent the points accurately. The spherical mapping also wastes pixels that are in the square but not in the sphere.|$|R
