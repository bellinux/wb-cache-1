Shepton Mallet (High Street) closed with the withdrawal of passenger services on the Yatton to Witham line in 1963, though part of the former East Somerset line remains open for freight and as a heritage railway. Shepton Mallet (Charlton Road) closed in 1966 with the closure of the Somerset and Dorset line. Nowadays, the nearest Network Rail station is Castle Cary, some eight miles south of Shepton Mallet. However, the nearest station on the East Somerset Railway is Mendip Vale, which is a mile <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{its early}} years the Institute {{operated}} at Abasolo 858 Oriente in a large, two-story house located a block <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>away</b> from Zaragoza Square, behind the city's Metropolitan Cathedral. As these facilities soon proved to be insufficient, it started renting out adjacent buildings and by 1945 {{it became apparent that}} a university campus was necessary. For that reason, a master plan was commissioned to Enrique de la Mora and on 3 February 1947 what would later be known as its Monterrey Campus was inaugurated by Mexican President Miguel Alemán Valdés.|$|E

25|$|Cormorant was sailing to Egypt with dispatches for Sir Sidney Smith {{when she}} reached the African coast near Benghazi on 15 May. She then sailed for Alexandria, {{skirting}} the coast. That evening she ran hard aground in shallow water. In the morning the shore was visible about a mile <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>away,</b> with what proved to be the town of Damietta, which is east of Alexandria, in the distance. When it became clear that they could not free Cormorant, the crew abandoned ship, reaching the shore on boats and rafts. There the French took them prisoner.|$|E
500|$|On September 27, American Pharoah {{was made}} the 1–2 {{favorite}} for the Grade I FrontRunner Stakes over {{eight and a}} half furlongs at Santa Anita Park. As in his previous race, he was immediately sent to the front by Espinoza and stayed there, pulling away from his rivals in the straight to win by three and a quarter lengths over Calculator, with Texas Red a length <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>away</b> in third. After the race, Espinoza explained how the colt moved: [...] "All the way he was on a high cruising speed. He has such a long stride. He moves really nice and is light on his feet." [...] Baffert said, [...] "I can't believe his demeanor, how he has changed since his first out. He's so professional. He's really mentally there." ...|$|E
500|$|In February, Freeman's {{character}} was {{revealed to be}} Everett K. Ross, and Gwyneth Paltrow {{was reported to have}} joined the film for the January reshoots, reprising her role as Pepper Potts; however, in April 2016, it was revealed that Paltrow does not appear in the film, with Anthony Russo explaining that Paltrow's contract with Marvel had ended after Iron Man 3, and [...] "we decided early on that we could make Pepper’s break-up [...] have an emotional impact without actually having a scene with her." [...] On March 16, 2016, the Russo stated the film was [...] "about a week <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>away</b> from" [...] completion, with Joe adding that the film would have a post-credits scene, with the possibility for two or three total.

2500|$|The town of Camden was {{situated}} on a gentle elevation. [...] To {{the south and}} southwest lay the Wateree River and to the east was Pinetree creek. [...] A ring of redoubts, constructed by the British during their year-long occupation of the town, stretched from the Wateree to the Pinetree and covered the northern approaches. [...] Upon arrival on April 20, 1781 at Camden, {{it was apparent that}} the Continentals had lost the element of surprise as Rawdon's forces were prepared on all fronts. [...] Being unable to storm the town or surround the entire circle of fortifications, Greene chose to encamp his army about a mile <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>away</b> on a small elevation called Hobkirk's Hill, blocking Great Waxhaw Road. [...] As he did not have enough men to besiege Camden, Greene, hoping to draw Rawdon into an attack on the position, organized the camp so that battle positions could be taken quickly {{in the event of an}} alarm.|$|E
60|$|Joe {{sought for}} the land. A mile <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>away</b> it lay--a long, low stretch of sandy beach {{with a heavy}} surf thundering upon it. Behind {{appeared}} desolate marshlands, while far beyond towered the Contra Costa Hills.|$|E
60|$|The Spanish skipper {{instantly}} {{brought his}} vessel about, but {{while she was}} still rolling in the trough of the sea with her sails flapping, an 8-inch shrapnel shell came hurtling through the air from the water-battery, a mile <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E

60|$|The fleet dropped anchor {{at about}} half a mile from the town. Just as they did so, a ferryman named Koppelstok, who was {{carrying}} passengers across from the town of Maaslandluis, a town on the opposite bank a mile <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>away,</b> was passing close by the Good Venture.|$|E
60|$|The Sea-horse {{was lying}} {{head to wind}} a mile <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>away,</b> and the two prizes ran rapidly up to her.

60|$|Some people {{two blocks}} <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>away</b> saw the rescue. They {{said that the}} auto {{was nothing but a}} drab noise with a black speck {{in the middle of it}} for Chris, when a big bay horse with a lizard lying on its back cantered up {{alongside}} of it, and the lizard reached over and picked the black speck out of the noise.|$|E
50|$|It {{was also}} the {{railhead}} for Uppingham, just over three <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> miles <b>away,</b> <b>and</b> remained so for many journeys even after Uppingham gained its own station {{in the form of}} the LNWR branch line from Seaton.|$|R

60|$|Moreover, that cry {{would have}} been useless. The night was dark and wet, and those {{citizens}} who felt ready for excitement were busy mobbing the Hall of Justice, a mile <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>away.</b> One or two heads had appeared at the small windows of the squalid houses opposite, {{but it was too}} dark to see anything, and the scuffle had very quickly subsided.|$|E
60|$|Two days passed, {{when the}} news came that the Egyptians had {{advanced}} to Umdabieh, seven miles nearer; and, on the following morning, the Dervish camp was disturbed early. There was joy in every face, and renewed vigour in the bearing of the men. Scouting Dervishes had brought in word that the infidels had marched, during the night, and were now halting but a mile <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
60|$|It {{was agreed}} that the captain {{and two of the}} men, of the most pacific demeanour, should go to the nearest town, some forty miles away, to lay in stores.

60|$|Four or {{five more}} shots were fired, {{but they all}} fell astern; and as they were fully two miles <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>away</b> when the last gun was {{discharged}}, and the cannoneers must have known that they were far out of range, Captain Martin felt sure that the mate's idea was a correct one, and that the cannon had been discharged rather as a signal than with any hope of reaching them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Preston was {{a strong}} natural position; an enemy coming from the south could only reach it by {{crossing}} a narrow bridge over the river Ribble a mile <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>away,</b> and {{this could have been}} held by a company against an army. From the bridge to the town the road was so narrow that in several places two men could not ride abreast. It ran between two high and steep banks, and it was here that Cromwell was nearly killed when he attacked Charles's troops.|$|E
60|$|Day {{after day}} Mowgli {{would lead the}} buffaloes out to their wallows, and day after day he would see Gray Brother's back a mile <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>away</b> across the plain (so he knew that Shere Khan had not come back), and day after day he would lie on the grass {{listening}} to the noises round him, and dreaming of old days in the jungle. If Shere Khan had made a false step with his lame paw up in the jungles by the Waingunga, Mowgli would have heard him in those long still mornings.|$|E
50|$|The second {{development}} was the ABLA homes located one <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> miles <b>away</b> from the Henry Horner Homes.
