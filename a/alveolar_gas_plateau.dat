40|$|Equations {{have been}} derived to {{determine}} the <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> concentrations which occur when the Magill (Mapleson A) circuit is used with a low fresh <b>gas</b> flow. <b>Alveolar</b> oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations {{are determined by the}} fresh gas flow and composition, carbon dioxide output and oxygen uptake. Gas mixing within the circuit and alterations in the inspired gas concentrations do not affect the final equilibrium. If oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide output are constant, the <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> concentrations are unaffected by alterations in ventilation. The economical behaviour of the Magill (Mapleson A) circuit during spontaneous ventilation is well recognized. Because of the relative positions of the components, <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> is vented selectively from the circuit when the expiratory valve opens {{in the latter part of}} expiration. Mapleson (1954) showed that if the fresh gas flow were equal to, or greater than, the subject's alveolar ventilation, no rebreathing of <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> would occur, all the <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> being vented from the system. The validity of this analysis has been supported in clinical studies (Kain and Nunn, 1968; Norman, Adams and Sykes, 1968). Mapleson (1958), analysing the behaviour of this circuit when the fresh gas flow did not exceed the alveolar ventilation, showed that the alveolar carbon dioxide concentration was a function of the fresh gas flow and the carbon dioxide output. He deduced the relationship: F A O O 2 = FCO 2 /FF A similar relationship was deduced by Nunn and Newman (1964). These authors, like Mapleson, emphasized that under low-flow conditions FAC 02 was not influenced by alterations in ventilation. The present analysis was stimulated by the results of a detailed study of gaseous homeostasis in the Magill circuit with low fresh gas flows (Conway et al., 1976). It was noted that, despite marked altera-tions of inspired gas concentrations and ventilation, when the fresh gas flow did not exceed the predicted alveolar ventilation, there were only slight changes in the end-tidal oxygen concentrations. The following discussion assumes that the subject is breathing spontaneously, a steady state is present...|$|R

Nor is it known, if blood O 2 carrying capacity affects the tissue-specific oxygenation responses. Thus, we investigated <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> exchange and tissue (m. vastus lateralis, m. biceps brachii, cerebral cortex) oxygenation during incremental treadmill exercise until volitional fatigue, and their associations with blood O 2 carrying capacity in 22 healthy men. <b>Alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> exchange was measured, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to monitor relative concentration changes in oxy- (Δ[O 2 Hb]), deoxy- (Δ[HHb]) and total hemoglobin (Δ[tHb]), and tissue saturation index (TSI). NIRS inflection points (NIP), reflecting changes in tissue-specific oxygenation, were determined and their coincidence with ventilatory thresholds (anaerobic threshold (AT), respiratory compensation point (RC); V-slope method) was examined. Blood O 2 carrying capacity (total hemoglobin mass (tHb-mass)) was determined with the CO-rebreathing method. In all tissues, NIPs coincided with AT, whereas RC was followed by NIPs. High tHb-mass associated with leg muscle deoxygenation at peak exercise (e. g., Δ[HHb] from baseline walking to peak exercise vs. tHb-mass: r = 0. 64, p < 0. 01), but not with arm muscle- or cerebral deoxygenation. In conclusion, regional tissue oxygenation was characterized by inflection points, and tissue oxygenation in relation to <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> exchange during incremental treadmill exercise resembled previous findings made during incremental cycling. It was also found out, that O 2 delivery to less active m. biceps brachii may be limited by an accelerated increase in ventilation at high running intensities. In addition, high capacity for blood O 2 carrying {{was associated with a}} high level of m. vastus lateralis deoxygenation at peak exercise...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} algorithms for estimating O 2 and CO 2 transfer at the pulmonary capillaries by use of a nine-compartment tidally ventilated lung model that incorporated inhomogeneities in ventilation-to-volume and ventilation-to-perfusion ratios. Breath-to-breath O 2 and CO 2 exchange at the capillary level and at the mouth were simulated by using realistic cyclical breathing patterns to drive the model, derived from 40 -min recordings in six resting subjects. The SD of the breath-by-breath gas exchange at the mouth around the value at the pulmonary capillaries was 59. 7 +/- 25. 5 % for O 2 and 22. 3 +/- 10. 4 % for CO 2. Algorithms including corrections for changes in alveolar volume and for changes in <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> composition improved the estimates of pulmonary exchange, reducing the SD to 20. 8 +/- 10. 4 % for O 2 and 15. 2 +/- 5. 8 % for CO 2. The remaining imprecision of the estimates arose almost entirely from using end-tidal measurements to estimate the breath-to-breath changes in end-expiratory <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> concentration. The results led us to suggest an alternative method that does not use changes in end-tidal partial pressures as explicit estimates of the changes in <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> concentration.

40|$|Hypoxemia in {{patients}} with "alveolar-capillary block syndrome " {{is believed to be}} due to a barrier to the diffusion of oxygen caused by thickened alveolar and capillary membranes (1, 2). The-oretical considerations indicate that thickened membranes should not result in a Po 2 difference between <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> and pulmonary capillary blood when patients with impaired diffusion breathe 100 per cent 02. Inhalation of 02, there-fore, should always correct hypoxemia {{in patients}} in whom a barrier to diffusion is the only defect. The reasoning is as follows: inhalation of 02 at sea level raises alveolar Po 2 to about 670 mm Hg, and the large initial Po 2 difference between <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> and blood entering the pulmonary capillaries (600 to 630 mm Hg) causes a rapid diffusion of 02 across even thickened alveolar-capillary membranes and prompt saturation of the hemoglobin (3, 4). After hemoglobin is satu-rated with 02, the 02 behaves like an inert gas and enters the blood only in physical solution and almost instantaneously, so that blood leaving the pulmonary capillaries is in equilibrium with the Po 2 in the <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas.</b> Our original plan was to test this theory by measuring directly the arterial Po 2 of patients with "pure " alveolar-capillary block syndrome while they were breathing pure 02. If the theory is correct (and if pulmonary artery-to-vein shunts are not increased in these patients) the arterial Po 2 should equal that of healthy subjects breath-ing pure 02 (620 to 650 mm Hg).

40|$|Gas {{concentrations}} and ventilation {{levels have}} been measured within a conventional Magill circuit when conscious volunteers breathed a non-narcotic gas mixture at varying fresh gas flows. When evidence of rebreathing of <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> was detected, the fresh gas flow was kept constant {{until a steady}} state developed. All subjects showed evidence of rebreathing when the fresh gas flow approached the predicted alveolar ventilation levels. A variety of subject-circuit interactions was seen and shown to be precipitated by naturally occurring breath-to-breath variations in ventilation. A single large breath could perturb the system. This could have a temporary effect, when the fresh gas flow was sufficient to wash the increased aliquot of expired carbon dioxide from the circuit.

40|$|BACKGROUND: One of {{the central}} {{physiological}} functions of the lungs is to transfer inhaled gases from the alveoli to pulmonary capillary blood. However, current measures of <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> uptake provide only global information and thus lack the sensitivity and specificity needed to account for regional variations in gas exchange. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we exploit the solubility, high magnetic resonance (MR) signal intensity, and large chemical shift of hyperpolarized (HP) (129) Xe to probe the regional uptake of <b>alveolar</b> <b>gases</b> by directly imaging HP (129) Xe dissolved in the gas exchange tissues and pulmonary capillary blood of human subjects. The resulting single breath-hold, three-dimensional MR images are optimized using millisecond repetition times and high flip angle radio-frequency pulses, because the dissolved HP (129) Xe magnetization is rapidly replenished by diffusive exchange with alveolar (129) Xe. The dissolved HP (129) Xe MR images display significant, directional heterogeneity, with increased signal intensity observed from the gravity-dependent portions of the lungs. CONCLUSIONS: The features observed in dissolved-phase (129) Xe MR images are consistent with gravity-dependent lung deformation, which produces increased ventilation, reduced alveolar size (i. e., higher surface-to-volume ratios), higher tissue densities, and increased perfusion in the dependent portions of the lungs. Thus, {{these results suggest that}} dissolved HP (129) Xe imaging reports on pulmonary function at a fundamental level...|$|R

The novel features of this work are 1 D reconstruction of the tracheobronchial tree structure on the basis of 3 D segmentation of the computed tomography (CT) data; 1 D− 0 D coupling of the models of 1 D bronchial tube and 0 D alveolar components; and the <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> exchange model.

For the healthy lung, the extent to which this influence is of functional importance in limiting heterogeneity in <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> composition by matching regional perfusion (q̇) to regional ventilation (v̇) remains unclear. To address this issue, the efficiency of regulation (E) was defined as the percent correction to an initial perturbation in regional <b>alveolar</b> <b>gas</b> composition generated by the pulmonary vascular response to the disturbance. This study develops the theory to calculate E from global measurements of vascular reactivity to CO 2 and O 2 in human volunteers. For O 2, these data were available from the literature. For CO 2, an experimental component of the present study used Doppler echocardiography to evaluate the magnitude of the global vascular response to hypercapnia and hypocapnia in 12 volunteers over a timescale of ∼ 0. 5 h. The results suggest a value for E of ∼ 60 % over a wide range of values for v̇-to-q̇ ratio (∼ 0. 1 – 10) encompassing those found in normal lung. At low v̇/q̇ (0. 65), the response to CO 2 dominates.
