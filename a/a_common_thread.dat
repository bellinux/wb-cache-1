500|$|Caligari and German Expressionism heavily {{influenced}} the American film noir {{period of the}} 1940s and 50s, both in visual style and narrative tone. Noir films tended to portray everyone, even the innocent, {{as the object of}} suspicion, <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>thread</b> in Caligari. [...] The genre also employs several Expressionistic elements in its dark and shadowy visual style, stylized and abstract photography, and distorted and expressive make-up and acting. Caligari also influenced films produced in the Soviet Union, such as Aelita (1924), and The Overcoat. Observers have noted the black and white films of Ingmar Bergman bear a resemblance to the German films of the 1920s, and film historian Roy Armes has called him [...] "the true heir of Caligari". Bergman himself, however, has downplayed the influence of German Expressionism on his work. Caligari has also affected stage theatre. Siegfried Kracauer wrote that the film's use of the iris-in has been mimicked in theatrical productions, with lighting used to single out a lone actor.|$|E

The idea for [...] "200", however, was conceived before the fourteenth season began in March 2010, and before any of the season fourteen episodes that preceded it were conceived.

500|$|Another Hemingway scholar, Jim Berloon, {{disagrees with}} Tetlow, writing that its only unity {{consists}} of similarities in tone and {{style and the}} recurrence of the Nick Adams character. Although the first vignettes share <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>thread</b> about the war, each is distinctly framed, weakening any structural unity that might have existed. He blames the war, {{saying that it was}} too hard for Hemingway to write about it cohesively, that it was [...] "too large, terrible, and mentally overwhelming to grasp in its entirety". Instead, he says, Hemingway wrote fragments, [...] "discrete glimpses into hell... like the wreckage of battle lit up from a shell burst at night." [...] The structure apparent in the 1924 collection of vignettes is lost in the later edition because the short stories seem to bear little if any relationship to the interchapters, shattering the carefully constructed order. The sense of discordance is intensified because the action is about unnamed men and soldiers, only referred to with pronouns, and unspecified woundings. The characters are transformed through circumstances and settings, where danger exists overtly, on the battlefield, or, in one case, by a chance sexual encounter in a Chicago taxi.|$|E
500|$|The Final Frontier {{appeared}} amidst {{several other}} films that grappled with quests for God and spiritual meaning; author Peter Hansenberg regarded {{the film as}} part of an [...] "almost fashionable" [...] trend of 1980s science fiction movies with religious motifs. Regent's Park College professor and Baptist minister Larry Kreitzer argues the film was [...] "deliberately constructed" [...] to raise the issues of God and the Biblical concept of paradise, Eden. Dixie State College professor Ace Pilkington went further, saying that after the [...] "theological preoccupations" [...] of the television series and previous films, [...] "where else can the Enterprise go ... but in quest of God?" [...] Pilkington notes that The Final Frontier has roots in many plots from the series including [...] "The Way to Eden" [...] (which also deals with a brilliant man hijacking the Enterprise to find the place of creation), [...] "", and [...] ""; <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>thread</b> between the paradises described is that they are always [...] "too good to be true". John S. Schultes agrees, pointing out that the idea of paradise has been seen many times in the series, but almost always illusory or deadened.|$|E

In a conference call interview with journalists, John Noble explained that [...] "probably the best fun that I've had [...] was doing the stuff with Chris Lloyd, because it was two crazy old guys just trying desperately to communicate with each other. We had a lot of laughs. There was <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>thread</b> of trying to find the music again, because Chris' character had forgotten how to play the piano, so we go through this journey of bringing the music back to him, and [...] thrill to Walter.

Come What(ever) Mays lyrics include themes of [...] "pain, pleasure, happiness, and grief". The diversity in subjects is evident throughout the album; songs including [...] "Come What(ever) May" [...] were politically influenced while the track [...] "Socio" [...] is about [...] "social anxiety attacks" [...] that Taylor suffered. [...] "Zzyzx Rd" [...] is a love song written to Taylor's wife for helping him in his struggles against alcoholism and contemplation of suicide.

Particular {{attention is paid to}} dialogues, which often drag on past all logic, and include much stuttering, mumbling and other noises rendered phonetically. Most of his comic books are collections of short stories, with <b>a</b> loose <b>common</b> <b>thread.</b> Like his mentor Gotlib, Goossens has also often used a mock-encyclopedic tone.
