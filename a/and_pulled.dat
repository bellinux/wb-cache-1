40|$|Although pushing <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> is {{very common}} in {{occupational}} settings, this type of manual materials handling is less well studied than lifting and carrying. Several issues should be considered when obtaining exposure measures in epidemiological field studies on pushing <b>and</b> <b>pulling.</b> The {{purpose of this article}} is threefold: (i) to critically evaluate different methods to assess push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> forces, (ii) to describe measures of exposure to pushing <b>and</b> <b>pulling,</b> <b>and</b> (iii) to consider measurement strategies for assessment of exposure to pushing <b>and</b> <b>pulling.</b> Firstly, information on the level of exerted forces with the accuracy needed for epidemiology can only be obtained from direct measurement methods. These methods are particularly required when push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> tasks are biomechanically analysed, implying that also force direction and point of application relative to the worker have to be assessed. Secondly, to obtain a limited number of external exposure measures that reflect exposure to pushing <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> over time, aggregation of various force measurements is suggested. Internal exposure measures and parameters corresponding to guidelines are also described. Thirdly, for truck drivers and refuse collectors a strategy of approximately five repeated measurements for each representative working situation is advised to obtain a reliable estimate of an individual's exposure to pushing <b>and</b> <b>pulling.</b> Relevance to industryAn overview is given of methods to assess forces accompanying pushing <b>and</b> <b>pulling,</b> which are very common activities in industry. Examples of exposure measures and measurement strategies in studies on adverse health effects of pushing <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> are presented. Such studies should eventually stimulate prevention of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R
40|$|Objectives Low-back and {{shoulder}} complaints {{were examined in}} relation to self-reported and objectively assessed exposure to work-related pushing <b>and</b> <b>pulling.</b> Methods Workers from several companies (eg, nursing homes and flower auctions) with pushing <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> tasks <b>and,</b> as reference, workers without physically demanding tasks were invited to participate. Altogether 829 workers initially received a questionnaire, of whom 459 responded both initially and after I year of follow-up. Initially, self-reported exposure to pushing <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> was assessed by questionnaire. Furthermore, {{a representative sample of}} 131 workers was observed at work using TRAC (task recording and analysis on computer) to assess exposure to pushing <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> objectively. For exposure to pushing <b>and</b> <b>pulling,</b> the workers were classified into a reference group and medium and high exposure groups. Initially and in the follow-up, the 12 -month prevalence of low-back {{and shoulder}} complaints was assessed. Complaints reported in the follow-up were separately used as dependent variables to calculate prevalence rate ratios (PR) in a Cox's proportional hazard regression analysis. Results The adjusted PR values were not significant for low-back complaints. For shoulder complaints, both the medium and high exposure groups showed significant adjusted PR values for self-reported exposure and observed duration of pushing <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> when compared with the reference group (PR range 2. 18 - 4. 86). For the observed frequency of pushing <b>and</b> <b>pulling,</b> only the medium exposure group showed a significant PR, of 3. 95. Conclusions The findings suggest a rather strong relationship between pushing <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>and</b> shoulder complaints. The evidence for a relationship between pushing <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>and</b> low-back complaints is limite...|$|R
5|$|American {{football}} {{in the early}} 1900s had become increasingly violent; with no forward pass, the ball carrier would be typically pushed <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> up the field by his own players in massive formations that often resulted in serious injuries.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to perform a comprehensive review of psychophysically determined maximum acceptable pushing <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> forces. Factors affecting pushing <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> forces are identified and discussed. Recent studies show a significant decrease (compared to previous studies) in maximum acceptable forces for males but not for females when pushing <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> on a treadmill. A comparison of pushing <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> forces measured using a high inertia cart with those measured on a treadmill shows that the pushing <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> forces using high inertia cart are higher for males but are about the same for females. It is concluded that the recommendations of Snook and Ciriello (1991) for pushing <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> forces are still valid and provide reasonable recommendations for ergonomics practitioners. Regression equations as a function of handle height, frequency of exertion and pushing/pulling distance are provided to estimate maximum initial and sustained forces for pushing <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> acceptable to 75 % male and female workers. At present {{it is not clear whether}} pushing or pulling should be favored. Similarly, it is not clear what handle heights would be optimal for pushing <b>and</b> <b>pulling.</b> Epidemiological studies are needed to determine relationships between psychophysically determined maximum acceptable pushing <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> forces <b>and</b> risk of musculoskeletal injuries, in particular to low back and shoulders.

40|$|Recent yearsâ€™ {{terrorist}} attacks in Europe and the flow of foreign fighters joining the terrorist organisation Daesh, has made the understanding of radicalisation evermore crucial. This thesis investigates if push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> factors leading into violent Islamic extremism differentiate between men and women. Furthermore, it assesses how preventive measures from The United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark targets push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> factors <b>and</b> if these are sensitive to sex. To fulfil this objective an exploratory thematic {{analysis was used to}} synthesise secondary qualitative research surrounding push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> factors. The push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> factor analysis revealed three trends: there were limited variation in the overall categories describing the push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> factors present for men and women; what caused push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> factors to manifest differed according to sex; and, there were differences in how much men and women were affected by these factors. The assessment of prevention measures showed that none of the measures explicitly mentioned push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> factors, yet they all had the potential of targeting these. Sex was included in some aspects of the measures, but was not a consideration in relation to the targeting of push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> factors. The thesis ends with a discussion of what implications the found results have for practice and offers suggestions to how prevention measures can be improved...|$|R

40|$|This {{exploratory}} study aims at closing an inherent {{gap in the}} literature on research on private parks. Specifically, the aim of this study is threefold: (a) to identify the push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> factors that influence decisions to visit private parks; (b) to examine the differences in these push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> factors for different sociodemographic groups; and (c) to investigate the interrelationships among these push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> fac-tors. Data were collected from 228 visitors who were intercepted at various locations in a private park. The survey instrument assessed the reasons for visiting the park (push factors) and evaluated how well the park performed on a series of selected park attributes (pull factors). The results of a factor analysis revealed three push factors <b>and</b> three <b>pull</b> factors. Other analyses included an evaluation of the inter-relationship between these factors in terms of different sociodemographic subgroups and a general correlation analysis on the interrelationship among push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> factors. This study provides useful managerial and practical implications for park managers, policymakers and communication strategists to gain an understanding of how push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> factors affect tourists and their choice of private parks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This study {{recruited}} 30 young Taiwanese {{males to}} determine the horizontally maximum isometric pushing <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> strengths under 16 exertion heights and four handle-foot horizontal distances. This study shows that isometric push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> strengths as measured on a simulated frictional floor condition in Taiwanese hypermarkets were markedly lower than previous tests using high-traction flooring or anchoring participantâ€™s feet. Pushing strengths were always higher than pulling in all 64 task combinations, whereas {{no significant differences were}} present at heights of 30 â€“ 60 cm. When considering maximum push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> force demands, the optimal heights for such activities would be 50 â€“ 90 cm (approximately ranged from the knee to hip position). The push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> strength profiles identified in this study must be used appropriately, considering the real task situations...|$|R
