This process results in formation of an asymmetric Ta [...] Ta 2 O 5 [...] MnO 2 capacitor that has different characteristics at forward (positive bias applied to tantalum) and reverse (positive bias applied to manganese cathode) voltages. Reverse bias currents might be several orders of magnitude larger than forward leakage currents so I-V characteristics of tantalum capacitors resemble characteristics of semiconductor rectifiers. Asymmetric I-V characteristics of Ta [...] anodic Ta 2 O 5 systems have been observed at different top electrode materials including metals, electrolytes, conductive polymers, and manganese oxide thus indicating that this phenomenon is likely related to {{the specifics of the}} Ta [...] Ta 2 O 5 interface. There have been multiple attempts to explain rectifying characteristics of capacitors employing anodic tantalum pentoxide dielectrics. A brief review of works related to reverse bias (RB) behavior of tantalum capacitors shows that the mechanism of conduction in Ta [...] Ta 2 O 5 systems is still not clear and more testing and analysis is necessary to understand the processes involved. If tantalum capacitors behave just as rectifiers, then the assessment of the safe reverse bias operating conditions would be a relatively simple task. Unfortunately, these parts can degrade with time under reverse bias significantly, and this further complicates analysis of the I-V characteristics and establishing safe operating areas of the parts. On other hand, time dependence of reverse currents might provide additional information for investigation of the processes under reverse bias conditions. In practice, there were instances when, due to unforeseen events, the system operated at conditions when capacitors experience periodically a relatively small reverse bias for some time followed by normal, forward bias conditions. In such a case an assessment should be made on the degree to which these capacitors are degraded by application of low-voltage reverse bias, and whether this degradation can be reversed by normal operating conditions. In this study, reverse currents in different types of tantalum capacitors were monitored at different reverse voltages below 15 %VR and temperatures in the range from room to 145 C for up to 150 hours to get better understanding of the degradation process and determine conditions favorable to the unstable mode of operation. The reversibility of RB degradation has been evaluated after operation of the capacitors at forward bias conditions. The effect of reverse bias stress (RBS) on reliability at normal operating conditions was evaluated using highly accelerated life testing at voltages of 1. 5 VR and 2 VR and by analysis of changes in distributions of breakdown voltages.

A significant removal of naphthalene and 2 -methylnaphthalene was observed at early stages of incubation in all treatments and was attributed to their high volatility. In the case of phenanthrene, a significant removal (93. 83  ±  1. 68 %) was measured in the closed circuit SMFCs with the anode acting as the main TEA and under combined anode and sulfate reduction conditions (88. 51  ±  1. 3 %).

40|$|Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) are an {{innovative}} and attractive technology that combines bacterial metabolism with electrochemistry for wastewater treatment. In a BES, 'electro-active' bacteria engage in extracellular electron transfer reactions with solid-state electrodes, which serve as electron acceptors or donors in their energy metabolism. So far, the most studied BES is the {{microbial fuel cell}} (MFC), in which microorganisms use an <b>anode</b> as <b>terminal</b> electron acceptor for the oxidation of waste organic substrates, thereby generating electrical power. The more recent discovery that cathodes can also serve as electron donors to drive microbial reductions of oxidized compounds, has opened new perspectives for application of BESs (besides electricity generation) {{in the field of}} bioremediation and in the production of fuels and chemicals. These latter systems are typically regarded as microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) since, differently from MFCs, require the voltage generated from substrate oxidation (at the anode) to be boosted with a power supply in order to drive the target cathodic reaction, otherwise energetically unfeasible. Here, a fully biological MEC coupling acetate (as model substrate) oxidation to biomethane generation has been developed.

Hence a 7 segment plus decimal point package will only require nine pins, though commercial products typically contain more pins, and/or spaces where pins would go, in order to match standard IC sockets. Integrated displays also exist, with single or multiple digits. Some of these integrated displays incorporate their own internal decoder, though most do not: each individual LED is brought out to a connecting pin as described.Multiple-digit LED displays as used in pocket calculators and similar devices used multiplexed displays {{to reduce the number of}} I/O pins required to control the display. For example, all the anodes of the A segments of each digit position would be connected together and to a driver circuit pin, while the cathodes of all segments for each digit would be connected. To operate any particular segment of any digit, the controlling integrated circuit would turn on the cathode driver for the selected digit, and the anode drivers for the desired segments; then after a short blanking interval the next digit would be selected and new segments lit, in a sequential fashion. In this manner an eight digit display with seven segments and a decimal point would require only 8 cathode drivers and 8 anode drivers, instead of sixty-four drivers and IC pins. Often in pocket calculators the digit drive lines would be used to scan the keyboard as well, providing further savings; however, pressing multiple keys at once would produce odd results on the multiplexed display.|$|R

Using lactate as the electron donor, <b>anodes</b> serving as <b>terminal</b> microbial electron acceptors were operated at three different electrode potentials (+ 0. 71 V, + 0. 21 V & - 0. 19 V vs. SHE) {{and the development of}} catalytic activity was monitored by measuring the current traces over time. Once maximum current was reached (usually within 21 - 29 h) the electrochemical systems were shut off and biofilm proteins were extracted from the electrodes for proteomic assessment. SWATH-MS analysis identified 704 proteins, and quantitative comparison was made of those associated with tricarboxcylic acid (TCA) cycle. Metabolic differences detected between the biofilms suggested a branching of the S. oneidensis TCA cycle when grown at the different electrode potentials. In addition, the higher abundance of enzymes involved in the TCA cycle at higher potential indicates an increase in metabolic activity, which is expected given the assumed higher energy gains. This study demonstrates high numbers of identifications on BES biofilm samples can be achieved in comparison to what is currently reported. This is most likely due to the minimal preparation steps required for SWATH-MS. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved...|$|R

This study assesses the potential for microbial fuel cells (MFCs) to treat such wastewaters and generate electricity under extreme saline conditions. Specifically, {{the focus is on}} the feasibility to treat hypersaline wastewater generated by the emerging unconventional oil and gas industry (hydraulic fracturing) and so, with mean salinity of 100 g/L NaCl (3 -fold higher than sea water). The success of this novel technology strongly depends on finding a competent and resilient microbial community that can degrade the waste under extreme saline conditions and be able to use the <b>anode</b> as their <b>terminal</b> electron acceptor (exoelectrogenic capability). I demonstrated that MFCs can produce electricity at extremely high salinity (up to 250 g/l NaCl) with a power production of 71 mW/m 2. Pyrosequencing analysis of the anode population showed the predominance of Halanaerobium spp. (85 %), which has been found in shale formations and oil reservoirs. Promoting Quorum sensing (QS, cell to cell communication between bacteria to control gene expression) was used as strategy to increase the attachment of bacteria to the anode and thus improve the MFC performance. Results show that the power output can be bolstered by adding 100 nM of quinolone signal with an increase in power density of 30 %, for the first time showing QS in Halanaerobium extremophiles. To make this technology closer to market applications, experiments with real wastewaters were also carried out. A sample of produced wastewater from Barnet Shale, Texas (86 g/L NaCl) produced electricity when fed in an MFC, leading to my discovery of another predominant electroactive and halophile specie in the anode, Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus, which is known for its extraordinary biodegradation capabilities. These findings suggest the potential of the MFC technology to treat hypersaline high-strength wastewaters while producing electricity, a result which would alleviate a major economic and environmental challenge for the oil and gas industry. In addition, this research represents a promising start overall in advancing biological treatment of saline wastewaters in other contexts, which is a largely unexploited field...|$|R
