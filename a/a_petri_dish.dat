5|$|Agar.io is a massively {{multiplayer}} online action game {{created by}} Matheus Valadares. Players control a cell in a map representing <b>a</b> <b>petri</b> <b>dish.</b> The {{goal is to}} gain as much mass as possible by eating agar and cells smaller than the player's cell, while avoiding larger ones which can eat the player's cell(s). The name comes from the substance agar, used to culture bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Mycena aurantiomarginata uses a tetrapolar mating system, whereby genes at two {{different}} locations on the chromosomes regulate sexual compatibility, or mating type. This system prevents self-fertilization and ensures {{a high degree}} of genotypic diversity. When the fungal mycelia is grown in culture on <b>a</b> <b>petri</b> <b>dish,</b> the colonies are white, odorless, and typically have a central patch of congested aerial hyphae that grow upward from the colony surface, which abruptly become flattened to submerged, and occasionally form faint zone lines. The hyphae commonly form deposits of tiny amorphous crystals where they contact other mycelial fronts, especially where the hyphae are vegetatively incompatible and destroy each other by lysis.|$|E
5|$|The {{anamorphic}} form of P.semilanceata is an asexual {{stage in}} the fungus's life cycle involved {{in the development of}} mitotic diaspores (conidia). In culture, grown in <b>a</b> <b>petri</b> <b>dish,</b> the fungus forms a white to pale orange cottony or felt-like mat of mycelia. The conidia formed are straight to curved, measuring 2.0–8.0 by 1.1–2.0μm, and may contain one to several small intracellular droplets. Although little is known of the anamorphic stage of P.semilanceata beyond the confines of laboratory culture, in general, the morphology of the asexual structures may be used as classical characters in phylogenetic analyses to help understand the evolutionary relationships between related groups of fungi.|$|E

5|$|The {{objective}} of Agar.io is {{to grow a}} cell on <b>a</b> <b>petri</b> <b>dish</b> by swallowing both randomly generated pellets (agar), which slightly increases a cell's mass, and smaller cells, without being swallowed by larger cells. The browser version currently holds four game modes: FFA (Free-For-All), Teams, Experimental, and Party. The mobile version of the game includes FFA (Free-For-All) and Rush Mode. The goal {{of the game is}} to obtain the largest cell; players must restart when all their cells are eaten. Players can change their cell's appearance with predefined words, phrases, symbols or skins. The more mass a cell has, the slower it will move. Cells gradually lose a small amount of mass over time.|$|E

Many A. ferus larvae moved from their individual prepared holes and attacked each other during radiation treatment (which took place overnight) resulting in high levels of mortality. Surviving individuals were transferred to individual 10 -mL diet tubes, but, during rearing, some chewed through the plastic lids between weekly checks and became mixed in a communal container. Mixing made it impossible to determine the dose received by many individuals and a formal analysis of A. ferus larval data was not possible.|$|R

25|$|Another {{germination}} event {{during the}} life cycle of gymnosperms and flowering plants is the germination of a pollen grain after pollination. Like seeds, pollen grains are severely dehydrated before being released to facilitate their dispersal from one plant to another. They consist of a protective coat containing several cells (up to 8 in gymnosperms, 2-3 in flowering plants). One of these cells is a tube cell. Once the pollen grain lands on the stigma of a receptive flower (or a female cone in gymnosperms), it takes up water and germinates. Pollen germination is facilitated by hydration on the stigma, {{as well as by the}} structure and physiology of the stigma and style. Pollen can also be induced to germinate in vitro (in <b>a</b> <b>petri</b> <b>dish</b> or test tube).|$|E

500|$|Jeffrey Brent, {{the past}} {{president}} of the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology, was invited to testify about the potential role of thimerosal-containing vaccines in triggering Michelle's autism. He stated that [...] "there was not a single study indicating that any form of mercury could cause serious neurological symptoms in the dosages that were used in vaccines" [...] and criticized Aposhian's use of in vitro studies and his equating them to what happens in the actual animal, arguing that [...] "the exposure to a cell in <b>a</b> <b>petri</b> <b>dish</b> was far more likely to cause damage than an equivalent dosage in a living system." [...] With regard to specific in vitro studies, Brent argued that the Goth study was flawed because it tested thimerosal on mouse cells, not human cells; because these cells were exposed not to ethylmercury, as the human body would be after receiving a thimerosal-containing vaccine since thimerosal is quickly metabolized to ethylmercury, but to thimerosal itself, and because the cells were exposed to far higher concentrations of thimerosal than could ever occur {{as a result of the}} administration of thimerosal-containing vaccines. Brent highlighted similar problems with the Agrawal study, noting that the cells in that study, like those in the Goth study, were exposed to thimerosal, not ethylmercury, and to much higher doses than found in vaccines. He also examined the Bradstreet and Geier study and the Holmes study, noting that [...] "much better studies from other investigators could not replicate the results of either the Holmes study or the Bradstreet/Geier study," [...] citing two other peer-reviewed papers which had concluded that hair mercury levels were not significantly different between study participants with autism and controls, as well as a study which had concluded that children with autism had no chelatable heavy-metal body burden whatsoever. Brent also pointed out that, like another of Bradstreet's studies, the Bradstreet-Geier study had been published in a non-indexed journal, the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons, which he described as [...] "very much of a fringe journal with lots of alternative agendas, and it's not even indexed by the National Library of Medicine." [...] Brent concluded by testifying that thimerosal could not have degraded Michelle's immune system to the extent that when she was vaccinated with MMR nine months later, it caused brain damage, saying [...] "That couldn't possibly be the case." [...] In the second set of the proceedings, which pertained to thimerosal alone (as opposed to thimerosal working in conjunction with MMR), Brent testified, with regard to Jordan King and one other child with autism who also served as a test case in this trial, that there was [...] "absolutely no reason to chelate them for any mercury-related reason." ...|$|E

2500|$|Since CAH is a {{recessive}} gene, {{both the}} mother and father must be recessive carriers of CAH for a child to have CAH. Due to advances in modern medicine, those couples with the recessive CAH genes have an option to prevent CAH in their offspring through preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). In PGD, the egg is fertilized outside the women's body in <b>a</b> <b>petri</b> <b>dish</b> (IVF). On the 3rd day, when the embryo has developed from one cell to about 4 to 6 cells, one of those cells is removed from the embryo without harming the embryo. [...] The embryo continues to grow until day 5 when it is either frozen or implanted into the mother. Meanwhile, the removed cell is analyzed to determine if the embryo has CAH. If the embryo is determined to have CAH, the parents may make a decision as to whether they wish to have it implanted in the mother or not.|$|E
2500|$|Membrane {{filtration}} is {{the method}} of choice {{for the analysis of}} fecal coliforms in water. [...] Samples to be tested are passed through a filter of particular pore size (generally 0.45 micrometre). [...] The microorganisms present in the water remain on the filter surface. [...] The filter is placed in a sterile petri dish with a selective medium, growth of the desired organisms is encouraged, while other non--target organisms is suppressed. [...] Each cell develops into a separate colony, which can be counted directly, and the initial inoculum size can be determined. [...] Typically sample volumes of 100 ml will be used for water testing and filtered, with the goal of achieving a final desirable colony density range of 20 to 60 colonies per filter. [...] Contaminated sources may require dilution to achieve a [...] "countable" [...] membrane. The filter is placed on <b>a</b> <b>petri</b> <b>dish</b> containing M-FC agar and incubated for 24 hours at 44.5 °C (112.1 degrees F). [...] This elevated temperature heat shocks non-fecal bacteria and suppresses their growth. [...] As the fecal coliform colonies grow they produce an acid (through fermenting lactose) that reacts with the aniline dye in the agar thus giving the colonies their blue color.|$|E
