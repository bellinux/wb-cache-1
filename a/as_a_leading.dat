After a second visit to Italy he moved to London in 1757 and from 1761 he was Principal Painter in Ordinary to George III.

5|$|At the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, Gielgud {{did much}} to reclaim his {{position}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>leading</b> Shakespearean.

He followed this with three other Shakespeare productions with Brook, which were well received. His own attempt at direction in Stratford, for Richardson's Macbeth in 1952, was much less successful, with poor notices for the star and worse ones for the director.|$|E
