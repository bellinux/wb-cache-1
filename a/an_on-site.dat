5|$|Close to {{the village}} and gorge are Batts Combe quarry and Callow Rock quarry, two of the active Quarries of the Mendip Hills where {{limestone}} is still extracted. Operating since the early 20thcentury, Batts Combe is {{owned and operated by}} Hanson Aggregates. The output in 2005 was around 4,000 tonnes of limestone per day, one third of which was supplied to <b>an</b> <b>on-site</b> lime kiln, which closed in 2009; the remainder was sold as coated or dusted aggregates. The limestone at this site is close to 99percent carbonate of calcium and magnesium (dolomite).|$|E

The site receives approximately 1,000 visitors a day, more on Shiva ratri, dance festivals, the World Heritage Day (18 April) and World Heritage Week between 19 and 25 November for special events.|$|E
5|$|The New Harbour {{was later}} renamed as Keppel Harbour in 1900 after Admiral Sir Henry Keppel of HMS Meander, {{who carried out}} <b>an</b> <b>on-site</b> survey to build an {{anchorage}} in the harbour in the 1880s. He was also known for his successful campaigns against the pirates in 1842 that were boldly harassing merchant ships {{in close proximity to}} the harbour. Piracy became less of a danger to the trade of Singapore only from the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{complexity}} of the missile and the need for extensive testing prior to launch, the V-2's designers at the Peenemünde Army Research Center favoured using heavily defended fixed sites where the missiles could be stored, armed, and fuelled from <b>an</b> <b>on-site</b> LOX production plant before launching. But the German Army and the V-2 project's head, Major-General Walter Dornberger, were concerned that the sites would be vulnerable to aerial attack by the Allies. The Army's preferred option was to use Meillerwagens, mobile firing batteries, which presented a much smaller target for the Allied air forces.|$|E

Rosen is currently ranked as the #5 Hospitality Management school in the nation (and the youngest of the top five programs so rated).|$|E
5|$|Various {{concepts}} were mooted for the A-4's deployment in a March 1942 {{study by}} Walter Dornberger, {{the head of}} the A-4 development project at the Peenemünde Army Research Center. He suggested that the missiles should be based in heavily defended fixed sites of a bunker-style design similar to the massive submarine pens then under construction in occupied France and Norway. The rockets could be stored in such sites, armed, fuelled from <b>an</b> <b>on-site</b> LOX production plant, and launched. This offered significant technical advantages; not only would the LOX loss be minimised, but the complex process of pre-launch testing would be simplified. A high rate of fire could be sustained as the facility could effectively operate like a production line, sending a steady flow of missiles to the launch pads.|$|E

25|$|A {{planning}} {{application for}} <b>an</b> <b>on-site</b> 251-room hotel was approved separately in 2010.
