30|$|The Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands (RCE) holds a large {{collection}} of historical pigments of different origin, which includes many pigments {{that are no}} longer available due to their poisonous nature. One of them is emerald green (copper <b>acetoarsenite).</b> The pigment in our collection was produced by the Dutch paint manufacturer N.V. Vernis-en Verffabriek Vettewinkel & Zonen established in Amsterdam between 1850 and 1970. The pigment was analyzed by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) which confirmed the presence of copper <b>acetoarsenite.</b>|$|E
30|$|Emerald green–copper <b>acetoarsenite,</b> Cu(C 2 H 3 O 2) 2.3 Cu(AsO 2) 2 —was {{found in}} several 19 th century works, (for example Table  1, # 40, 42, 43 and 44). This {{synthetic}} pigment was first manufactured commercially in Germany in 1814 and marketed rapidly following this. Despite {{the popularity of}} the new green, the traditional mixture of orpiment and indigo was still used for green in some 19 th century Iranian works (for example Table  1, # 41).|$|E
30|$|Picasso’s use {{of copper}} <b>acetoarsenite,</b> or emerald green, in The Blue Room is {{illustrated}} by the SR-XRF maps for copper (Cu) and arsenic (As) (Fig.  7). The maps overlap strongly, indicating that Picasso used emerald green in the light green stripes of the sofa and the highlights on the legs of the bathing figure in The Blue Room. Emerald green is also used in the small painting above the vase of flowers. When the Cu and As maps are compared with the Fe SR-XRF map, a mixture of emerald green and Prussian blue in the background of the Toulouse-Lautrec poster and in the undertone for the bouquet of flowers is indicated (Fig.  7). This mixture is also suggested for the brown wardrobe behind the central figure; however, a thick green layer (layer 2) under a blue surface layer in sample X 17, taken from the background just above the bathing figure’s shoulder, suggests there may alternately be an unidentified aspect of the hidden painting or Picasso’s process in this area.|$|E
40|$|Careless {{handling}} of industrial wastes often creates problems {{for human health}} and the environment. Chronic arsenic toxicity, resulting from household use of arsenic-contaminated water occurred in 53 out of 79 members (67 %) of 17 families residing in South Calcutta close to a factory that manufactured Paris-green (copper <b>acetoarsenite).</b> Clinical investigation of 20 of these affected persons showed typical skin pigmentation as well as palmar and plantar keratosis in all of them, while gastrointestinal symptoms, anaemia and signs of liver disease and peripheral neuropathy were seen in many. The water used by the affected families for drinking and cooking had been taken from shallow tubewells and had arsenic levels from 5. 0 to 58 mg/l (WHO permissible limit, 0. 05 mg/l). Other residents in the same area whose drinking-water came from deep tubewells or from tap water supplied by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (arsenic levels, < 0. 05 mg/l) were not affected. The study confirms that arsenic in the shallow tubewells was due to the waste discharged by the factory producing Paris-green. Contamination of groundwater by arsenic may be due to industrial discharges, mining operations, or mobilization of naturally occurring arsenic in sedi-mentary aquifers. Such contamination has bee...|$|E
30|$|Yellow {{orpiment}} (As 2 S 3) and red–orange realgar (As 4 S 4), used {{by artists}} from different cultures since antiquity, and emerald green (Cu(C 2 H 3 O 2) 2 · 3 Cu(AsO 2) 2), a popular brilliant green pigment first synthesized by Willem Sattler in 1814, are pigments that contain arsenic. They {{have all been}} found to be unstable in paints. Photo-degradation of realgar (As 4 S 4) and orpiment (As 2 S 3) results in sensitive, transparent, whitish, friable and/or crumbling paints, while chemically degraded emerald green pigment (Cu(C 2 H 3 O 2) 2 · 3 Cu(AsO 2) 2, copper (II) <b>acetoarsenite)</b> in oil paint leads to transparent, dark brown layers [1] or stains on paper [2]. The degradation of these arsenic-containing pigments seriously affects the appearance and stability of paintings and painted objects, the chemical changes are irreversible, and the accompanying physical changes {{to the rest of the}} object worsen the conservation problems. The physical alteration associated with the chemical degradation, often seen as cracking and crumbling of paint layers and surfaces, further enhances the degradation and poses a major conservation challenge [3, 4]. The cracked surfaces easily collect dirt from the environment, accentuating the discolored regions, and are vulnerable to further degradation when exposed to moisture and solvents during treatment. While discolored and crumbling paint can be consolidated, it cannot be readily cleaned. The open, porous structure creates an unvarnished painting (or painted furniture)-like surface. Re-varnishing the affected regions of the work, unfortunately, does not mitigate the problem because the highly mobile degradation products migrate through the varnish. The previous study indicated that the photo-degradation products of orpiment and realgar are highly water soluble, and consequently they do not remain at the location of the original pigment in the paint, but migrate throughout the whole multi-layered paint system [5]. For example, the investigation of an early eighteenth-century chest on stand that had been repeatedly varnished after the application of an orpiment design showed that the photo-oxidized arsenic species had migrated through each varnish layer, with larger deposits visible at the interface of each pair of layers [5].|$|E
40|$|Arsenical {{pesticides}} and herbicides were extensively used on apple, blueberry, and potato crops in New England {{during the first}} half of the twentieth century. Lead arsenate was the most heavily used arsenical pesticide until it was officially banned. Lead arsenate, calcium arsenate, and sodium arsenate have similar Pb isotope compositions: 208 Pb/ 207 Pb = 2. 3839 - 2. 4722, and 206 Pb/ 207 Pb = 1. 1035 - 1. 2010. Other arsenical pesticides such as copper <b>acetoarsenite</b> (Paris green), methyl arsonic acid and methane arsonic acid, as well as arsanilic acid are widely variable in isotope composition. Although a complete understanding of the effects of historical use of arsenical pesticides is not available, initial studies indicate that arsenic and lead concentrations in stream sediments in New England are higher in agricultural areas that intensely used arsenical pesticides than in other areas. The Pb isotope compositions of pesticides partially overlap values of stream sediments from areas with the most extensive agricultural use. 	The lingering effects of arsenical pesticide use were tested in a detailed geochemical and isotopic study of soil profiles from a watershed containing arsenic-enriched ground water in coastal Maine. Acid-leach compositions of the soils represent lead adsorbed to mineral surfaces or held in soluble minerals (Fe- and Mn-hydroxides, carbonate, and some micaceous minerals), whereas residue compositions likely reflect bedrock compositions. The soil profiles contain labile Pb (acid-leach) showing a moderate range in 206 Pb/ 207 Pb (1. 1870 - 1. 2069), and 208 Pb/ 207 Pb (2. 4519 - 2. 4876). Isotope values vary as a function of depth: the lowest Pb isotope ratios (e. g., 208 Pb/ 206 Pb) representing labile lead are in the uppermost soil horizons. Lead contents decrease with depth in the soil profiles. Arsenic contents show no clear trend with depth. A multi-component mixing scheme that included lead from the local parent rock (Penobscot Formation), lead derived from combustion of fossil fuels, and possibly lead from other anthropogenic sources (e. g., pesticides), could account for Pb isotope variations in the soil profiles. In agricultural regions, our preliminary data show that the extensive use of arsenical {{pesticides and}} herbicides can be a significant anthropogenic source of arsenic and lead to stream sediments and soils...|$|E
