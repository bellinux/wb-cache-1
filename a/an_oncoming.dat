5|$|Writer/artist Alison Bechdel's book Fun Home, {{a memoir}} in comics format, was {{published}} in 2006 to critical acclaim. Its subject is Alison Bechdel's coming of age, with particular emphasis on her relationship to her father, Bruce Bechdel. Alison's coming out as a lesbian {{is complicated by the}} revelation that Bruce was a closeted homosexual whose extra-marital affairs included underage men. Four months after Alison comes out to her parents, Bruce is killed by <b>an</b> <b>oncoming</b> truck; although the evidence is equivocal, Alison concludes that he committed suicide.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the {{depression}} turned northeast into a warm sector ahead of <b>an</b> <b>oncoming</b> cold front, and strengthened into a subtropical storm. The system continued to track northeast and strengthened slightly, reaching its peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) as it approached the Azores that evening. After tracking through the Azores, the storm weakened slightly {{as it moved}} to the north-northeast. Through an interaction with the cold front early on October5 the subtropical storm became extratropical. The system was fully absorbed by the front later that day. The newly absorbed system would separate from the dissolving frontal system and become Subtropical Storm Vince on October8.|$|E
40|$|While a leading-edge vortex on an {{infinite}} translating wing is shed {{after a short}} distance of travel, its counterpart on a finite span revolving insect wing or maple seed membrane exhibits robust attachment. The latter explains the aerodynamic lift generated by such biological species. Here we analyze the mechanisms responsible for leading-edge vortex attachment. We compute the Navier-Stokes solution of the flow past a finite span wing (i) embedded in <b>a</b> uniform <b>oncoming</b> flow, (ii) embedded in <b>a</b> spanwise varying <b>oncoming</b> flow, and (iii) revolving about its root. We show that over flapping amplitudes typical of insect flight (ϕ= 120 ∘), the spanwise gradient of the local wing speed may suffice in maintaining leading-edge vortex attachment. We correlate this result {{with the development of}} spanwise flow, driven by the spanwise gradient of pressure, and we evaluate the sensitivity of such a mechanism to the Reynolds number. It is noted, however, that leading-edge vortex attachment through the spanwise gradient of the local wing speed does not promote large lift, which ultimately arises from centrifugal and Coriolis effects...|$|R

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the book, the memoir exhibits Bruce Bechdel's obsession with restoring the family's Victorian home. His obsessive need to restore the house is connected to his emotional distance from his family, which he expressed in coldness and occasional bouts of abusive rage. This emotional distance, in turn, is connected with his being a closeted homosexual. Bruce Bechdel had homosexual relationships in the military and with his high school students; some of those students were also family friends and babysitters. At the age of 44, two weeks after his wife requested a divorce, he stepped into the path of <b>an</b> <b>oncoming</b> Sunbeam Bread truck and was killed. Although the evidence is equivocal, Alison Bechdel concludes that her father committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|Laminar {{boundary}} layers can be loosely classified {{according to}} their structure and {{the circumstances under which}} they are created. The thin shear layer which develops on an oscillating body {{is an example of a}} Stokes boundary layer, while the Blasius boundary layer refers to the well-known similarity solution near an attached flat plate held in <b>an</b> <b>oncoming</b> unidirectional flow and Falkner–Skan boundary layer, a generalization of Blasius profile. When a fluid rotates and viscous forces are balanced by the Coriolis effect (rather than convective inertia), an Ekman layer forms. In the theory of heat transfer, a thermal boundary layer occurs. A surface can have multiple types of boundary layer simultaneously.|$|E

The game has two endings depending on the side chosen. If playing as NATO, the main objective is to stall Soviet forces long enough until American reinforcements arrive. However, if playing as the Warsaw Pact, the objective is to destroy all NATO forces.|$|E

After leaving the station, the train entered the pocket track north of the station. As it continued, an automatic derailer {{at the end of}} the pocket track intentionally derailed the train as a safety measure. If the train had continued moving forward on the pocket track, it would have entered the path of <b>an</b> <b>oncoming</b> train. The wheels of the first two cars in the six-car, White-Flint-bound train were forced off the tracks, stopping the train. Almost all of the estimated 345 passengers were evacuated from the damaged train by 11:50am and the NTSB arrived on the scene by noon. Two minor injuries were reported, and a third passenger was taken to George Washington University Hospital. The NTSB ruled the crash was due to the train operator's failure to follow standard procedures and WMATA management for failure to provide proper supervision of the train operator which resulted in the incomplete configuration of the train identification and destination codes leading to the routing of the train into the pocket track.|$|E
