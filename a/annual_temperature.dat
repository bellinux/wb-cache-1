5|$|The Champagne {{province}} {{is located}} near the northern limits of the wine world along the 49th parallel. The high altitude and mean <b>annual</b> <b>temperature</b> of 10°C (50°F) creates a difficult environment for wine grapes to fully ripen.

5|$|The {{first years}} of the 14th century were marked by famines, {{culminating}} in the Great Famine of 1315–17. The causes of the Great Famine included the slow transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age, which left the population vulnerable when bad weather caused crop failures. The years 1313–14 and 1317–21 were excessively rainy throughout Europe, resulting in widespread crop failures. The climate change—which resulted in a declining average <b>annual</b> <b>temperature</b> for Europe during the 14th century—was accompanied by an economic downturn.|$|E

5|$|Although the 'kātĕpo' was {{reported}} to the Linnean Society as early as 1855, the spider was formally described as Latrodectus katipo by L. Powell in 1870. Spiders of the genus Latrodectus have a worldwide distribution and include all of the commonly known widow spiders: the North American black widow spider (Latrodectus mactans), the brown widow (Latrodectus geometricus), and the European black widow (Latrodectus tredecimguttatus). The katipo's closest relative is the Australian redback spider (Latrodectus hasseltii) Latrodectus katipo and L. atritus (black katipo) were previously thought to be two separate species, but {{research has shown that}} they are a single species, L. katipo, with colour variation that is clinal over latitude and correlated with mean <b>annual</b> <b>temperature.</b> The katipo is so closely related to the redback that it was at one stage thought to be a subspecies, with the proposed name Latrodectus hasseltii katipo. Further research has shown that the katipo is distinct from the redback, having slight structural differences and striking differences in habitat preference, and it remains its own species. The katipo's family Theridiidae has a large number of species both in New Zealand and worldwide and are commonly known as tangle-web spiders, cobweb spiders or comb-footed spiders.|$|E
5|$|In {{northern}} Europe {{the tree}} of heaven was not considered naturalised in cities until after the Second World War. This {{has been attributed to}} the tree's ability to colonise areas of rubble of destroyed buildings where most other plants would not grow. In addition, the warmer microclimate in cities offers a more suitable habitat than the surrounding rural areas (it is thought that the tree requires a mean <b>annual</b> <b>temperature</b> of 8 degrees Celsius to grow well, which limits its spread to more northern and higher altitude areas). For example, one study in Germany found {{the tree of}} heaven growing in 92% of densely populated areas of Berlin, 25% of its suburbs and only 3% of areas outside the city altogether. In other areas of Europe {{this is not the case}} as climates are mild enough for the tree to flourish. It has colonised natural areas in Hungary, for example, and is considered a threat to biodiversity at that country's Aggtelek National Park.|$|E

5|$|Patagonia, in the south, {{is mostly}} arid or semi–arid {{except in the}} extreme west where {{abundant}} precipitation supports dense forest coverage, glaciers, and permanent snowfields. Its climate is classified as temperate to cool temperate with the surrounding oceans moderating temperatures on the coast. Away from the coast, areas on the plateaus have large daily and <b>annual</b> <b>temperature</b> ranges. The influence of the Andes, in conjunction with general circulation patterns, generates {{one of the strongest}} precipitation gradients (rate of change in mean annual precipitation in relation to a particular location) in the world, decreasing rapidly to the east. In much of Patagonia precipitation is concentrated in winter with snowfall occurring occasionally, particularly in the mountainous west and south; precipitation is more evenly distributed in the east and south. One defining characteristic is the strong winds from the west which blow year-round, lowering the perception of temperature (wind chill), while being a factor in keeping the region arid by favouring evaporation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Global {{climate change}} has {{far-reaching}} effects on natural ecosystem and socio-economic system, {{and it is}} a hot issue that the governments and the scientific community as well as the general public pay attention to today. Meanwhile, climate change has strong regional characteristics. In the global context of climate warming, the climate change trends and intensity is not entirely consistent. Therefore, strengthening small regional climate change research plays an extremely important role on local agricultural production, livelihood and disaster prevention. On the basis of the monthly average temperature series in Guyuan meteorological station from 1957 to 2011, the temperature trends were analyzed with Mann-Kendall test and Pettitt jump test. The result with linear regression analysis showed that the <b>annual</b> average <b>temperature</b> in Guyuan City is in an increasing trend, and the average increase rate is 0. 3071 ℃/ 10 a. The <b>annual</b> highest <b>temperature,</b> the <b>annual</b> lowest <b>temperature,</b> and the <b>annual</b> average <b>temperature</b> in Guyuan City showed an upward trend with Mann-Kendall test. The biggest change is the <b>annual</b> lowest <b>temperature,</b> and the change rate is 0. 60 ℃/ 10 a, and then is the <b>annual</b> average <b>temperature</b> and <b>annual</b> highest <b>temperature.</b> Pettitt jump test results showed that the <b>annual</b> lowest <b>temperature</b> in Guyuan City changed in the earliest year before 1984. The <b>annual</b> average <b>temperature</b> and <b>annual</b> highest <b>temperature</b> changed nearly the year of 1993. Multiple regression analysis showed that changes of temperature in Guyuan City mainly occurred after the 1980 s, and there is a significant upward trend into the 21 st, which is in accordance with Pettitt jump test results...|$|R
