These sensors {{are based on a}} common approach that consists in placing a sheet of piezoresistive material {{on the top of a}} set of electrodes. We use a thin film of conductive polymer as the piezoresistive mate¬rial. Specifically, a conductive water-based ink of this polymer is deposited by spin coating on a flexible plastic sheet, giving it a smooth, homogeneous and conducting thin film. The main interest in this procedure is that it is cheap and it allows the fabrication of flexible and low cost tactile sensors. In this work we present results from sensors made using two technologies. Firstly, we have used a flexible Printed Circuit Board (PCB) technology to fabricate the set of electrodes and <b>addressing</b> <b>tracks.</b> The result is a simple, flexible tactile sensor. In addition to these sensors on PCB, we have proposed, designed and fabricated sensors with screen printing technology.

Positioning cell-phones by Global System for Mobile communication was considered an attack on people's privacy. MAC addresses just keep a unique log of a WiFi or Bluetooth enabled device for connecting to another device that has not potential privacy infringements. This paper presents the use of MAC address data collection approach for analysis of spatio-temporal dynamics of human in terms of shared space utilization. This paper firstly discuses the critical challenges and key benefits of MAC address data as a tracking technology for monitoring human movement. Here, proximity-based MAC <b>address</b> <b>tracking</b> is postulated as an effective methodology for analysing the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of human movements at shared zones such as lounge and office areas. A case study of university staff lounge area is described in detail and results indicates a significant added value of the methodology for human movement tracking. By analysis of MAC address data in the study area, clear statistics such as staff’s utilisation frequency, utilisation peak periods, and staff time spent is obtained. The analyses also reveal staff’s socialising profiles in terms of group and solo gathering. The paper is concluded with a discussion on why MAC <b>address</b> <b>tracking</b> offers significant advantages for tracking human behaviour in terms of shared space utilisation with respect to other and more prominent technologies, and outlines some of its remaining deficiencies...|$|R

The objective is to minimize the accumulation of losses over the time horizon, a notion that is termed dynamic regret. While existing methods focus on convex loss functions, we consider strongly convex functions so as to provide better guarantees of performance. We derive a regret bound that captures the path-length of the time-varying parameter, defined in terms of the distance between its consecutive values. In other words, the bound represents the natural connection of tracking quality to the rate of change of the parameter. We provide numerical experiments to complement our theoretical findings...|$|R

It accomplishes this by effectively running two trackers in parallel: one based on detections from background subtraction providing target initialization and reacquisition, and one based on a target state regressor providing frame to frame tracking. We evalu-ated the proposed approach on a long sequence from a wide area aerial imagery dataset, and the results show improved object detection rates and ID-switch rates with limited in-creases in false alarms compared to the competition. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Dynamic {{information}} flow tracking (DIFT) works by tagging (or tainting) data and tracking it {{to measure the}} {{information flow}} throughout the system. Existing DIFT systems have limited support for address and control dependencies, and therefore cannot track information flow within a full system without addressing these very challenging dependencies in an application-specific fashion. A general way to <b>track</b> <b>address</b> and control dependencies will allow DIFT to be applied in a much wider variety of applications than is now possible, ranging from data provenance to behavioral malware analysis. <b>Tracking</b> <b>address</b> and control dependencies is largely a problem of stability: if these flows of information are tagged then the tainting scheme becomes unstable and soon the entire system becomes tainted, {{but if they are}} not tagged then information that should be tainted is not. In this paper, we propose relaxed static stability dynamic information flow tracking as a way to <b>track</b> <b>address</b> and control dependencies in a general fashion without compromising stability of the DIFT system. To the best of our knowledge, the system presented in this paper is the first DIFT system to measure full-system information flow with general support for <b>tracking</b> all <b>address</b> and control dependencies within the system. As a motivating example, in this paper we measure the amount of information flow between tainted sources and the control path of the CPU for a variety of scenarios. Our results demonstrate that <b>tracking</b> <b>address</b> and control dependencies is both: (1) necessary for meaningful measurements of the information flow in a real system, and (2) made possible by a relaxed static stability approach. Besides <b>tracking</b> <b>address</b> and control dependencies, other key research challenges addressed in this paper include how to handle loop constructs and how to prevent memory locations that are written once and read many times from leading to DIFT system instability. ...|$|R
