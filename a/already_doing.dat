He reports it to the Lovejoys and the Flanders, who confront Homer about the matter. Homer declares that he has no problem with Bart working there just as Marge returns home unexpectedly.|$|E
5|$|Although beaten, the Japanese did {{not leave}} the area. Lieutenant General Shigeru Katagiri, the {{commander}} of the Japanese 20th Division, ordered the 80th Infantry Regiment to hold the Wareo area to protect the withdrawal of the 79th Infantry Regiment and other units. The 2nd Battalion, 238th Infantry Regiment was to act as a rearguard on the coast. Lieutenant General Frank Berryman, the commander of Australian II Corps, now urged Wootten to commence a coastal advance to cut the Japanese supply lines and force Adachi to retreat from the Huon Peninsula if he were not <b>already</b> <b>doing</b> so. Wootten took a more cautious approach. The Battle of Wareo proved that the Japanese intended to defend the area. After a fierce fight, Wootten managed to drive the Japanese from the high ground around Sattelberg and Gusika. In early December, Adachi ordered all his troops to withdraw to Sio. Wareo was captured by the Australians on 8 December and the last Japanese rearguards left the area on 15 December. Meanwhile, Berryman's coastal advance had commenced on 5 December.|$|E

To help bolster ratings, Travis hires a new disc jockey, New Orleans native Gordon Sims (Venus Flytrap); and allows spaced-out former major market DJ Dr. Johnny Fever, <b>already</b> <b>doing</b> mornings in the easy listening format as John Caravella, to be himself.

25|$|The 100 Confederate cannons {{lining the}} top of the ridge {{initially}} hit few of their enemies during the Union rush, but once the Union soldiers stopped at the rifle pits, they began to zero in on them. The Confederate riflemen also poured in their fire causing several Union casualties. After several minutes, some Union unit commanders moved their men forward {{to get out of the}} worst fire. Willich's skirmishers started advancing up the ridge without orders. Deciding that following them was preferable to being massacred in the rifle pits, Willich gave orders to advance, although several of his units were <b>already</b> <b>doing</b> so. Seeing this, Hazen and Beatty also ordered their first lines up. When Wood reached the rifle pits, the men in the second line begged him to order them up as well. Wood sent them forward.|$|E
25|$|In 1894 Hackett {{was elected}} to the Legislative Council as {{representative}} of the south-western province, and held this seat until his death. He was a delegate to the 1891 and 1897 Federal conventions, and was appointed a member of the constitutional committee. He was asked to join more than one ministry, but had to decline as it was impossible for him to add to the work he was <b>already</b> <b>doing.</b> He was also of the opinion that, as a newspaper editor, he would {{no longer be able to}} speak with the same freedom if he were in office. He advocated women's suffrage, and Western Australia was one of the early jurisdictions to give women the vote. He also strongly supported Forrest in his development policy, in the building of the pipe line to the goldfields, and the making of Fremantle harbour. He was interesting himself very much in the Perth public library, museums, and national gallery of which he became president, and also in the proposed university. He was a prominent member of the Church of England, holding the offices of registrar of the Diocese of Perth and chancellor of St George's Cathedral. He declined a knighthood in 1902 but accepted it in 1911, and two years later was created KCMG.|$|E

Newman opted to include an interpolation in the track [...] "Komodo Dragon", used in a scene where Bond enters a casino in Macau. According to Newman the scene had [...] "a real moment of 'Bond' swagger", and the music fitted the scene accordingly. Epworth was visited by Newman for advice, and Redford, who was <b>already</b> <b>doing</b> the score's orchestration, was requested to arrange [...] "Komodo Dragon"; Newman was unable to do the arrangement because he felt that his task [...] "was already so huge and daunting".|$|E

500|$|Half of {{the first}} day's footage came out {{overexposed}} and unusable. Before the financiers or studio bosses knew about the problem, Soderbergh was <b>already</b> <b>doing</b> reshoots. The insurers made him agree that any further mishaps resulting in additional filming {{would come out of}} the director's own pocket. Soderbergh shot in various cities in California, Ohio and Texas, on a 54-day schedule and came in $2 million under budget. The director operated the camera himself in an effort to [...] "get as close to the movie as I can," [...] and to eliminate the distance between the actors and himself. Soderbergh drew inspiration from the cinema verite style of Ken Loach's films, studying the framing of scenes, the distance of the camera to the actors, lens length, and the tightness of eyelines depending on the position of a character. Soderbergh remembers, [...] "I noticed that there's a space that's inviolate, that if you get within something, you cross the edge into a more theatrical aesthetic as opposed to a documentary aesthetic". Most of the day was spent shooting {{because a lot of the}} film was shot with available light.|$|E

500|$|A {{month after}} the plan's establishment, Public Service Alliance of Canada Prairies Regional Executive Vice-President Marianne Hladun wrote {{an open letter to}} Brad Trost, MP for Saskatoon—Humboldt, saying that, while she {{approved}} of the NAP-CHT, the government was being inconsistent in its treatment of human trafficking because it had recently announced that it would be eliminating four CBSA intelligence officer positions, thereby dismissing four people who were <b>already</b> <b>doing</b> effective anti-human-trafficking work. When it was announced that foreign workers would no longer be issued permits for work in Canada's sex industry, Tim Lambrinos, leader of the Adult Entertainment Association of Canada, said that he might challenge the policy because he believed that [...] "strip clubs are a very safe environment" [...] and that the government was [...] "destroying an industry [...] creating a labour shortage." [...] At Toronto's third annual Walk for Freedom in September 2012, Shae Invidiata criticized the NAP-CHT for allotting only $500,000 to victim services, saying, [...] "I'm very grateful, but we need more." [...] Smith also said that the $500,000 allotted to support victims was insufficient. She said that many of these organizations [...] "still struggle to provide basic care for victims of human trafficking" [...] and {{that there should be a}} [...] "considerable increase in support from the federal and provincial governments for these organizations." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{actors who}} voiced the {{characters}} in the short later reprised their roles in The Simpsons series. Dan Castellaneta performed the voices of Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, and Krusty the Clown. Homer's voice sounds different in the shorts compared to most episodes of the half-hour show, as Castellaneta originally tried to impersonate Walter Matthau. Although he would retain this characteristic through the early episodes of the regular series, it was gradually dropped as Homer's personality evolved away from that of a stereotypical sitcom father. The producers of the show were in need of someone to do voiceovers, so rather than hire actors, they asked Castellaneta (who had already done some voice work) and Julie Kavner, both members of the Ullman Show cast, to do it. The kids still needed voices, and Nancy Cartwright, a journeyman voice actress, came in to audition. She recalled that [...] "I was <b>already</b> <b>doing</b> voicework for eight different shows at the time and thought this would just be another job. They originally wanted me for Lisa's voice, but I thought 'Nah, I don't want to be the boring middle child, I want to be a bratty 10-year old boy.' So as soon as I gave a demonstration, [...] hired me on the spot." [...] Some time later, Yeardley Smith, a 22-year-old B-movie actress whose most notable accomplishment to date was featuring in the notorious 1986 Stephen King film Maximum Overdrive, was brought in to do Lisa's voice. [...] The recording of the shorts was often primitive; according to Cartwright, the dialogue for the Ullman shorts was recorded on a portable tape deck in a makeshift studio, which consisted of the video engineer suite, above the bleachers on the Ullman show set. While most of the characters' personalities are similar to what they are in the series, Lisa is simply a clone of Bart and did not have a distinct personality until a few episodes into the regular series.|$|E
