5|$|With the Norwegian {{operation}} requirements {{drawn up}} for a coastal reconnaissance floatplane, a series of modifications were requested to the original design. The changes included a redesign of the float structure to accommodate either a torpedo or bomb load carried under the center fuselage to supplement five underwing bomb racks. Additional armament changes led {{to a combination of}} six machine guns replacing the four machine gun (two fixed forward, two flexible rear-mounted 7.9mm)/one cannon (forward facing, fixed 20mm) arrangement that was in the initial design. Provision for <b>a</b> <b>rear</b> under-fuselage gun was also made. Further equipment requirements including fitting <b>a</b> <b>rear</b> fuselage-mounted camera as well as changes to instrumentation and radio equipment.|$|E
5|$|A highsider, highside, or {{high side}} {{is a type of}} bike motion which is caused by <b>a</b> <b>rear</b> wheel gaining {{traction}} when it is not facing in the direction of travel, usually after slipping sideways in a curve. This can occur under heavy braking, acceleration, a varying road surface, or suspension activation, especially due to interaction with the drive train. It can {{take the form of a}} single slip-then-flip or a series of violent oscillations.|$|E
5|$|An initial {{meeting on}} May 30 nearly ended in disaster. Waite and several local civic leaders called union {{president}} Calderwood and mine owners Hagerman and Moffat {{to a conference}} in a meeting hall {{on the campus of}} Colorado College in Colorado Springs. Talks were under way and proceeding well when a mob of local citizens attempted to storm the building. Blaming Calderwood and Waite for the violence in Cripple Creek, they intended to lynch both men. As a local judge distracted the mob, Calderwood and Waite escaped out <b>a</b> <b>rear</b> door and onto the governor's waiting train.|$|E

5|$|Herd's {{knowledge}} of aerodynamics and Bruce McLaren's experience with Ford's sports car racing programme combined to spur the team into experimenting with aerodynamic bodywork. The M2A was fitted with <b>a</b> <b>rear</b> wing that produced downforce – downwards {{pressure on the}} car and tyres which allows faster cornering – and reduced lap times by three seconds at a test at Zandvoort circuit in November 1965, {{two and a half}} years before the Brabham and Ferrari teams eventually debuted wings in a Grand Prix. The team intended to use the wing on the M2B, but the engine problems that occurred prevented this.|$|E
5|$|How much {{braking force}} {{to apply to}} each wheel depends both on ground {{conditions}} and on the balance of weight on the wheels at each instant in time. The total braking force cannot exceed the gravity force on the rider and bike times the coefficient of friction µ of the tire on the ground. mgµ >= Ff + Fr. A skid occurs if the ratio of either Ff over Nf or Fr over Nr is greater than µ, with <b>a</b> <b>rear</b> wheel skid having less of {{a negative impact on}} lateral stability.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, {{the arsenal}} was renamed Little Rock Barracks {{and the main}} {{building}} used as married officers' quarters. The building was drastically altered the inside and outside. Prior to renovation, <b>a</b> <b>rear</b> basement door provided the only entrance, while the tower served as a hoist to move munitions between floors. By 1868, front and rear porches had {{been added to the}} building, as well as interior walls and stairs, some of which remain today, including the central staircase. In 1880, Douglas MacArthur was born on the northwest upper floor of this building while his father, U.S. Army Captain Arthur MacArthur, was stationed there.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} {{fight on the}} {{preliminary}} card, American Kickboxing Academy's Jon Fitch faced Akihiro Gono. The bout saw Fitch continually taking down Gono and landing with ground-and-pound punches on the downed opponent. Fitch came close to submitting Gono {{in the first and}} second rounds when he went for <b>a</b> <b>rear</b> naked choke and an armbar respectively, but he was unable to finish the Japanese fighter. All three judges scored the bout in favor of Fitch, two scoring it 30–27 with one judge seeing it 30–26 giving Fitch the unanimous decision victory.|$|E
5|$|It is {{also worth}} noticing {{that in the}} early 16th century one of the houses which predated the palace hosted an osteria. In the late 1510s Raphael, at that time {{painting}} the Vatican loggias, often had lunch together with his aides in <b>a</b> <b>rear</b> room of that eatery. The artists often discussed work problems during lunch, sketching different solutions {{on the walls of the}} room. When the palace was built, the osteria remained in place, and the owners always took care of the walls of that room throughout the years.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{competed in}} his {{preliminary}} round matchup against Aaron Wilkinson {{in the third}} episode. After some early striking exchanges in the first round, Wilkinson {{was able to take}} Johnson down and utilise ground-and-pound punches and elbows. In the second round, Johnson landed an early superman punch, as well as a takedown. After takedowns were achieved by both men, Johnson stuffed a final attempt and took the second round on the judges scorecards. In the sudden victory round, Johnson attacked quickly, which allowed him to end the fight via <b>a</b> <b>rear</b> naked choke.|$|E
