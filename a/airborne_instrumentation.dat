In the past, the testing and training communities developed separate <b>airborne</b> <b>instrumentation</b> systems primarily because available technology couldn't encompass both communities' requirements. As budgets get smaller, as requirements merge, and as technology advances, the separate {{systems can be}} used interoperably and possibly merged to meet common requirements. Using DIS {{to bridge the gap}} between the RAJPO test instrumentation system and the Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) training systems provides a defacto system-level interoperable interface while giving both communities the added benefits of interaction with the modeling and simulation world. The RAJPO leads the test community in using DIS. RAJPO instrumentation has already supported training exercises such as Roving Sands 95, Warfighter 95, and Combat Synthetic Test, Training, and Assessment Range (STTAR) and major tests such as the Joint Advanced Distributed Simulation (JADS) Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&E) program.

The RAJPO is committed to fostering interoperable <b>airborne</b> <b>instrumentation</b> systems as well as interfaces to virtual and constructive systems in the modeling and simulation world.

Herein the development of a comprehensive set of microphysical models based on in situ measurements of particle size distributions (PSDs) is discussed. Two parameters are developed and examined: ice water content (IWC) and median mass diameter D m. Comparisons are provided between the IWC and D m values derived from in situ measurements obtained during a series of field campaigns held in the midlatitude and tropical regions and those calculated from a set of modeled ice particles used for light-scattering calculations. The ice particle types considered in this study include droxtals, hexagonal plates, solid columns, hollow columns, aggregates, and 3 D bullet rosettes. It is shown that no single habit accurately replicates the derived IWC and D m values, but a mixture of habits can significantly improve the comparison of these bulk microphysical properties. In addition, the relationship between D m and the effective particle size D eff, defined as 1. 5 times the ratio of ice particle volume to projected area for a given PSD, is investigated.
