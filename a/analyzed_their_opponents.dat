40|$|The {{move toward}} standards-based {{instruction}} calls for greater student {{involvement in the}} learning process. Cooperative learning is widely used as many standards-based school departments advocate greater employment of constructivist classrooms as the most appropriate vehicle of instruction. During academic year 2002 - 03, 42 students from California State University Hayward's (CSUH) teacher education credential program, {{in conjunction with the}} Build a Future Without AIDS program at the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, taught a conflict resolution curriculum/AIDS education curriculum to inner city public high school students who were part of an alternative school program for adjudicated youth. The CSUH students randomly assigned public school students to groups of four, which were then divided into two pairs. Each pair was assigned a pro or con position on a curricular issue. They researched, presented, and discussed their positions, critically <b>analyzed</b> <b>their</b> <b>opponents</b> ' positions, and rebutted their opponents&apos...|$|E
40|$|Coaches {{can benefit}} from {{objective}} information about playing styles applied in football matches. In this work, two methods for determining (characteristics of) the playing style of a football team in a certain match based on statistics of ball actions are constructed. The first method assigns a match to one of four commonly applied playing styles in football based {{on a set of}} benchmark matches. Within this method, a relevant variable set with respect to the playing style of a team is selected based on the so-called minimum-redundancy-maximum-relevance algorithm. This algorithm makes use of mutual information as a measure of relevance. The mutual information between variables is estimated by the so-called Kraskov and adjusted Kraskov estimator. After a relevant variable set has been found, matches are assigned to one of the four playing styles by the use of a combination of a hierarchical scheme of K-means clustering and 1 -Nearest Neighbors. The second method focuses on general playing style characteristics of matches as opposed to labeling a match with a specific playing style. This way, details about the playing style in a match can be obtained without limiting to the four prior labeled playing styles. Using principal component analysis combined with domain knowledge, three characteristic variables are created which together give a general overview regarding the playing style applied in a match. Application of both models on different sets of matches show satisfying results which agree with domain know-ledge. These models can be used to provide football coaches with information regarding playing styles applied in matches. Coaches can use this information in order to both evaluate their own team as well as <b>analyze</b> <b>their</b> <b>opponents.</b> Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer ScienceDelft Institute of Applied MathematicsProbability, Risk and Statistic...|$|R
25|$|In a two-player game of cribbage, {{a player}} scores one match point for winning a game. <b>Their</b> <b>opponent</b> will start as dealer {{in the next}} game. If a player skunks <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> (reaches 121 points before <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> scores 91 points), that player wins two match points for that game. If a player double skunks <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> (reaches 121 points before <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> reaches 61), they score three or four match points for the game, {{depending}} on local convention. If a player triple skunks <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> (reaches 121 points before <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> reaches 31 points), they automatically win the match. Double and triple skunks {{are not included in}} the official rules of cribbage play and are optional. There are several different formats for scoring match points.|$|R
50|$|The {{player that}} captures all of <b>their</b> <b>opponent's</b> pieces wins. Alternatively, the player that fully {{occupies}} <b>their</b> <b>opponent's</b> triangular board wins. Another way to win, is {{if a player}} can trap <b>their</b> <b>opponent's</b> pieces and thus preventing them from performing a legal move.|$|R
50|$|In a two player game of cribbage {{a player}} scores one match point for each game won. <b>Their</b> <b>opponent</b> will begin {{the next game}} as first dealer. If a player skunks <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> (reaches 121 points before <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> scores 91 points) then that player scores one extra match point for that game (two match points in total). If a player double skunks <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> (reaches 121 points before <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> reaches 61), then they score two extra match points for the game (four match points in total). If a player triple skunks <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> (reaches 121 points before <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> reaches 31 points), they {{automatically}} win the match regardless of how many match points are needed to win.

50|$|Blast Off: Players are {{attached}} to their partners, matched up two-on-two in football helmets and shoulder pads against <b>their</b> <b>opponents</b> in a circle, and have to tackle <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> out of the circle.

50|$|At combat sports, such as boxing {{and mixed}} martial arts, having a higher index is often beneficial. Fighters such as Jon Jones and Conor McGregor {{have a longer}} arm span than most of <b>their</b> <b>opponents.</b> This allows them to use their arm span to hit <b>their</b> <b>opponents,</b> where as <b>their</b> <b>opponents</b> could not hit them. They often use this in their game plan, by keeping their distance, {{allowing}} them to cover up(keeping their hands out towards <b>their</b> <b>opponent)</b> or use it to counter punch them.|$|R
50|$|In round 2, {{instead of}} bidding, one player selects a category, after which <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> selects answers until finding a Wipeout, {{at which point}} <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> takes {{over control of the}} board. A player wins the board by {{selecting}} the eighth and final correct answer. If one player finds the fourth wrong answer, <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> automatically wins the board.|$|R

50|$|To win the game, {{a player}} needs to inflict more damage upon <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> {{than they have}} received. This causes <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> to lose <b>their</b> life points and the game.|$|R

50|$|Facing <b>their</b> <b>{{opponent}},</b> the wrestler reaches between <b>their</b> <b>opponent's</b> {{legs with}} one arm and reaches around their back from the same side with their other arm. The wrestler lifts <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> up and turns them upside down {{so that they are}} held up by the wrestler's arm cradling their back. The wrestler then throws the opponent to the ground so that they land on <b>their</b> back. The <b>opponent</b> will often assist the slammer by placing their arm on the slammer's thigh.|$|R
5000|$|Most new Khet players allow <b>their</b> <b>opponents</b> to [...] "control" [...] the game, {{and focus}} on attack or defense {{depending}} on the actions of <b>their</b> <b>opponent.</b> However, more experienced players often concentrate on quickly building up a strong defense, and then relentlessly attacking <b>their</b> <b>opponent's</b> pieces, aiming ultimately to reach the Pharaoh. Some take this strategy even farther, and spend almost the entire game focusing on creating an impenetrable defense, simply waiting for <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> to make a fatal mistake, or to leave themselves open to allow a quick strike at their Pharaoh. The average game lasts approximately 10 minutes, however a game between experienced players may take much longer.|$|R

5000|$|A player wins {{if he or}} she reduces <b>their</b> <b>opponent's</b> {{pieces to}} one, or stalemates <b>their</b> <b>opponent's</b> pieces by not {{allowing}} them to move on <b>their</b> turn.

50|$|The {{objective}} {{of the game is}} for a player to either get one of their cubes to the far corner square in the grid (where <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> started) or to remove all of <b>their</b> <b>opponent's</b> cubes from the board.|$|R
50|$|On each player's first turn, {{they must}} place one of <b>their</b> <b>opponent's</b> pieces on any empty {{space on the}} board. The piece must be a flat stone of <b>their</b> <b>opponent's</b> color. Play then {{proceeds}} normally with players controlling their own pieces.|$|R
