6000|$|The case of {{the general}} talk of [...] "progress" [...] is, indeed, an extreme one. As enunciated today, [...] "progress" [...] is simply a {{comparative}} of which we have not settled the superlative. We meet every ideal of religion, patriotism, beauty, or brute pleasure with the alternative ideal of progress--that is to say, we meet every proposal of getting something that we know about, with an <b>alternative</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>of</b> getting {{a great deal more}} of nobody knows what. Progress, properly understood, has, indeed, a most dignified and legitimate meaning. But as used in opposition to precise moral ideals, it is ludicrous. So far from it being the truth that the ideal of progress is to be set against that of ethical or religious finality, the reverse is the truth. Nobody has any business to use the word [...] "progress" [...] unless he has a definite creed and a cast-iron code of morals. Nobody can be progressive without being doctrinal; I might almost say that nobody can be progressive without being infallible--at any rate, without believing in some infallibility. For progress by its very name indicates a direction; and the moment we are in the least doubtful about the direction, we become in the same degree doubtful about the progress. Never perhaps {{since the beginning of the}} world has there been an age that had less right to use the word [...] "progress" [...] than we. In the Catholic twelfth century, in the philosophic eighteenth century, the direction may have been a good or a bad one, men may have differed more or less about how far they went, and in what direction, but about the direction they did in the main agree, and consequently they had the genuine sensation of progress. But it is precisely about the direction that we disagree. Whether the future excellence lies in more law or less law, in more liberty or less liberty; whether property will be finally concentrated or finally cut up; whether sexual passion will reach its sanest in an almost virgin intellectualism or in a full animal freedom; whether we should love everybody with Tolstoy, or spare nobody with Nietzsche;--these are the things about which we are actually fighting most. It is not merely true that the age which has settled least what is progress is this [...] "progressive" [...] age. It is, moreover, true that the people who have settled least what is progress are the most [...] "progressive" [...] people in it. The ordinary mass, the men who have never troubled about progress, might be trusted perhaps to progress. The particular individuals who talk about progress would certainly fly to the four winds of heaven when the pistol-shot started the race. I do not, therefore, say that the word [...] "progress" [...] is unmeaning; I say it is unmeaning without the previous definition of a moral doctrine, and that it can only be applied to groups of persons who hold that doctrine in common. Progress is not an illegitimate word, but it is logically evident that it is illegitimate for us. It is a sacred word, a word which could only rightly be used by rigid believers and in the ages of faith.|$|E

Notions of justice and fairness in poverty response for people with a disability tend to be subsumed under neoliberal and neoconservative reforms.

40|$|Advances in {{transition}} state theory and computer simulations are providing {{new insights into}} the sources of enzyme catalysis. Both lowering of the activation free energy and changes in the generalized transmission coefficient (recrossing of the transition state, tunneling, and nonequilibrium contributions) can play a role. A framework for under-standing these effects is presented, and the contributions of the different factors, as illustrated by specific enzymes, are identified and quantified by computer simulations. The resulting understanding of enzyme catalysis is used to comment on <b>alternative</b> <b>proposals</b> <b>of</b> how enzymes work. E nzyme catalysis, which can produce rateaccelerations as large as a factor of 1019 (1), involves molecular recognition at the highest level of development.

30|$|Other <b>alternative</b> <b>proposals</b> <b>of</b> {{non-linear}} {{models are}} the “Exponential Autoregressive” model (EAR) of Haggan and Ozaki (1981), the “Threshold Autoregressive” model (TAR) of Tsay (1989) and the “Smooth Transition Autoregressive” model (STAR) of Teräsvirta (1994), {{which can be}} considered to contain the previous two. This latter model considers the existence of two regimes and the change between them follows a transition function that can be modeled with a logistic or exponential distribution. This function depends on an observable transition variable and is increasing when approaching or surpassing a given threshold. From this starting point, a smoothed transition between regimes is generated. It {{is important to note}} that a previous step to the application of the model is to reject the non-linearity of the series, the alternative hypothesis being the logistic or exponential STAR model. Following these criteria, Teräsvirta and Anderson (1992) estimate the STAR model for the quarterly production index or 13 OECD economies. They find that the model is adequate in describing the non-linearities and asymmetries of the series.|$|R
40|$|The present article aims {{to analyze}} the {{reception}} of media content within a gender perspective. The women’s full exercise of citizenship and access to public debate depends greatly on the way media presents them to the world. This study considers that balanced representation {{of men and women}} in the news is an important criterion to take into account in order to produce quality journalism. Considering the various television news programs, the evening news is definitely one of the most important and, yet, one of the less studied. Daily broadcast on a prime time schedule, it is considered to be an important source of information through which citizens acknowledge themain events of the news agenda and, also, their social roles and responsibilities. Therefore, several focus groups have been organized with the purpose of debating news contents and understanding how gender meanings are negotiated by audiences. The analysis of these debates displayed important gender perspectives among focus groups participants. Its outputs allowed a better understanding of how audiences interpret gender meanings in the media and emphasized the need to develop <b>alternative</b> <b>proposals</b> <b>of</b> journalistic practices capable of promoting a critical, balanced and diversified gender perspective within the audiences...|$|R

Nothing or very little has been written, however, on bicondicional meaning which often punctual hasta negative constructions assume. Starting with the <b>alternative</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>of</b> DECLERCK (1998) for the English preposition until, we will apply to Spanish the concept of exclusive-restrictive denial.

30|$|In 1974, Dr. W. Donner Denckla {{proposed}} Death Hormone or DECO (decreasing {{oxygen consumption}} hormone) Theory (Denckla 1974). Regularly {{released by the}} human pituitary gland, DECO suppresses the ability of cells to use thyroxine (Denckla 1974), which causes people to age. The principal functions of thyroxine are to stimulate oxygen consumption and control metabolism of all cells and tissues in the body (Welcker et al. 2013). Age-related decrease in use of growth hormone (GH) by body cells has also been found (Blackman et al. 2002). However, the death hormones are nonetheless unidentified.

40|$|Rett {{syndrome}} (RS) is {{a disease}} of neurological development. First reported 30 years ago in 1966, its biological and genetic basis remains obscure. RS is commonly thought of as an X linked dominant disorder lethal to hemizygous males. The few familial cases would arise through mosaicism or because of occasional females failing to manifest the disorder through skewed X inactivation in relevant cell types. We have one family where the mother and daughter are affected with RS, and which can be explained according to this hypothesis. If the <b>alternative</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>of</b> Thomas (1996) is correct, {{that the lack of}} males affected by such disorders {{is the result of a}} high male to female ratio of germline mutations rather than of gestational lethality, then the RS gene should be located on the grandpaternal chromosome.
