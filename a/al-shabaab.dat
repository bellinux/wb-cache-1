Throughout 2007 and 2008, <b>Al-Shabaab</b> scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern Somalia. At the end of 2008, the group had captured Baidoa but not Mogadishu. By January 2009, <b>Al-Shabaab</b> and other militias had managed to force the Ethiopian troops to retreat, leaving behind an under-equipped African Union peacekeeping force to assist the Transitional Federal Government's troops.|$|E

5|$|In November 2010, a new technocratic {{government}} {{was elected to}} office.

By August 2011, AMISOM and Somali forces had managed to capture all of Mogadishu from <b>Al-Shabaab.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tradition and old records {{assert that}} {{southern}} Somalia, including the Mogadishu area, was historically inhabited by hunter-gatherers. These were later joined by Cushitic-speaking agro-pastoralists, {{who would go}} on to establish local aristocracies. During its medieval Golden Age, Mogadishu was ruled by the Muzaffar dynasty, a vassal of the Ajuran Sultanate. It subsequently fell under the control of an assortment of local Sultanates and polities, most notably the Sultanate of the Geledi. The city later became the capital of Italian Somaliland (1889–1936) in the colonial period. After the Somali Republic became independent in 1960, Mogadishu became known and promoted as the White Pearl of the Indian Ocean. After the ousting of the Siad Barre regime in 1991 and the ensuing Somali Civil War, various militias fought for control of the city, later to be replaced by the Islamic Courts Union in the mid-2000s. The ICU thereafter splintered into more radical groups, notably <b>al-Shabaab,</b> which fought the Transitional Federal Government (2004–2012) and its African Union Mission to Somalia allies. With a change in administration in late 2010, government troops and their military partners had succeeded in forcing out <b>Al-Shabaab</b> by August 2011. Mogadishu has subsequently experienced a period of intense reconstruction.|$|E
5|$|In early March 2014, Somali {{security}} forces and AMISOM troops launched another operation to remove <b>Al-Shabaab</b> from the remaining areas in southern Somalia under its control. According to Prime Minister Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed, the government subsequently launched stabilization efforts in the newly liberated areas, which included Rab Dhuure, Hudur, Wajid and Burdhubo. However, there were continuing concerns that not enough was being done to revitalise and secure the newly liberated areas. By 26 March, the allied forces had liberated ten towns within the month, including Qoryoley and El Buur. UN Special Representative for Somalia Nicholas Kay described the military advance as the most significant and geographically extensive offensive since AU troops began operations in 2007.|$|E
25|$|On 28 September 2012, the Somali National Army {{assisted}} by AMISOM troops and Ras Kamboni militia launched {{an assault on}} Kismayo, <b>Al-Shabaab's</b> last major stronghold. The allied forces reportedly managed to re-capture {{much of the city}} from the insurgents.|$|R
50|$|Somali National Army {{officials}} {{based in}} the southwestern Gedo province announce that SNA and AMISOM troops are advancing towards <b>Al-Shabaab's</b> base in Baardhere. According to SNA Col. Khalif Noor Xirey, seizing Baardhere will greatly facilitate the capture of the last remaining insurgent-held areas.|$|R
50|$|Abdullahi Halakhe, a {{researcher}} with the Kenyan Amnesty International, {{suggested that the}} attack {{was not so much}} a reflection of <b>Al-Shabaab's</b> strength, but instead of the Kenyan government's incompetence. He also noted that the militant group was probably at its weakest point since 2006.|$|R
5|$|The Fifth Brigade was {{identified}} in reporting about a New Zealand UN advisor. Later, on June 9, 2014, Garowe Online {{referred to the}} Fifth and Sixth Brigades of the SNA, in Lower Shabelle. The 5th and 6th Brigades have fought against <b>Al-Shabaab</b> including in Mogadishu and Afgoye. With a post-training drop-out rate of around 10%, {{the vast majority of}} the EUTM-trained soldiers have continued to serve in the Somalia national security forces after their initial period of training abroad. Overall, the Somali armed forces' combat capability has strengthened due in part to having both more combat experience and international support, including training, leadership and planning facilitation.|$|E
5|$|Following the Games, she {{received}} death threats upon returning to Somalia, and after being confronted by <b>Al-Shabaab,</b> {{she began to}} deny {{that she was an}} athlete. The organisation banned woman from participating in sports, and Omar eventually made her way to Ethiopia in order to pursue the hope of competing in the 2012 Summer Olympics. She attempted to make her way to Europe, travelling to Libya in September 2011. Alongside other refugees, she attempted to cross the Mediterranean by sea in 2012; she drowned while attempting to board an Italian naval vessel when the boat she was on was intercepted off the coast of Libya. Omar's life story was later dramatised as the graphic novel An Olympic Dream: The story of Samia Yusuf Omar by German artist Reinhard Kleist.|$|E
5|$|In Mogadishu, Hawiye {{residents}} {{resented the}} Islamic Courts Union's defeat. They distrusted the TFG, {{which was at}} the time dominated by individuals from the Darod clan, believing that it was dedicated to the advancement of Darod interests in lieu of the Hawiye. Additionally, they feared reprisals for massacres committed in 1991 in Mogadishu by Hawiye militants against Darod civilians, and were dismayed by Ethiopian involvement. Critics of the TFG likewise charged that its federalist platform was part of a plot by the Ethiopian government to keep Somalia weak and divided. During its first few months in the capital, the TFG was initially restricted to key strategic points, with the large northwestern and western suburbs controlled by Hawiye rebels. In March 2007, President Ahmed announced plans to forcibly disarm militias in the city. According to the ISA, a coalition of local insurgents led by <b>Al-Shabaab</b> subsequently launched a wave of attacks against the TFG and Ethiopian troops. The allied forces in return mounted a heavy-handed response.|$|E
5000|$|During an {{official}} state visit to Mogadishu, top U.S. envoy Johnnie Carson dismissed <b>Al-Shabaab's</b> counter-offer as [...] "absurd".

5|$|In January 2012, Somali {{government}} forces and their AMISOM allies launched offensives on <b>Al-Shabaab's</b> last foothold {{on the northern}} outskirts of Mogadishu.

25|$|In early 2010 the {{two groups}} clashed in Hiran region, in central Somalia. This battle was also won by <b>al-Shabaab</b> which {{took control of the}} region.

In Lower Shabelle region <b>al-Shabaab</b> seized control of Hizbul Islam strongholds: Furuqley, Farsooley and Dugulle villages and then started preparing an offensive in Afgooye, the last town Hizbul Islam controlled in the region. Soon after Hizbul Islam was forced to surrender the Luuq District in Gedo region to <b>al-Shabaab,</b> after which it was announced that Hizbul Islam would merge with <b>al-Shabaab.</b> From mid-December <b>al-Shabaab</b> fighters started taking over Hizbul Islam positions. Hizbul Islam fighters also started entering <b>al-Shabaab</b> controlled areas of Mogadishu. The merge was confirmed on 20 December, when Hizbul Islam Chairman Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys and Sheikh Mohammad Osman Arus, the organisation's official spokesman, surrendered to <b>al-Shabaab</b> and disbanded the organisation.|$|E

At least 10 <b>Al-Shabaab</b> fighters have been killed during the confrontations and two military vehicles from Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a were reported seized.|$|E
25|$|Early in the morning, <b>Al-Shabaab</b> forces {{launched}} {{an attack on}} Garbaharey; they tried to seize the city but failed to.

The blast comes around a week after the regional president announced that he would relaunch the local Airport 50, which had been shut down for a few years. No party claims responsibility for the blast, but it fits <b>Al-Shabaab's</b> modus operandi.|$|R
5000|$|Most of <b>Al-Shabaab's</b> {{messages}} on Twitter are in English, with authorities {{suggesting that they}} are intended for an outside audience and potential recruits in the West. Officials in the United States, where Twitter is based, are exploring legal ways to terminate the account, although they acknowledge that doing so might raise free speech concerns. Chirchir commented in a tweet of his own that {{such a move would}} be counterproductive, as [...] "Al Shabaab needs to be engaged positively and twitter is the only avenue".|$|R
25|$|Despite <b>al-Shabaab's</b> growing power, {{mounting}} casualties among AMISOM peacekeepers {{and their}} already long {{presence in the}} war-torn country has led to plans to reduce ANISOM's presence in Somalia. Security responsibilities {{are supposed to be}} transferred to the Somali government's military. According to Lower Shebelle's deputy governor Ali Nur Mohamed, however, the SNAF units in his region have been weakened by factionalization, infighting and desertation. Because of that, they are not able to independently hold territory against insurgents, meaning that the presence of ANISOM troops in government-controlled areas of Lower Shebelle is crucial.|$|R
