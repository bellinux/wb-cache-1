Geometry of the proposed antenna array was optimized for the operation in two frequency bands located inside IEEE L band. Presented array structure is composed from ten microstrip radiators independently excited via separate coaxial input ports. Two central radiating elements for two frequency bands have circular shapes with slits and are stacked to provide compact sizes and convergence of their phase centers. Peripheral radiators have annular ring with slits topology. Their geometric centers are superposed with the corners of virtual quadrats with the sides equal to the half of the wavelength for the appropriate band to eliminate the appearance of grating lobes and additional nulls in equivalent radiation patterns.

40|$|<b>Adaptive</b> <b>antennas</b> {{with digital}} {{beamforming}} represent a promising technology for mitigation of radio interference and multipath effects in receivers of Global Satellite Navigation Systems (GNSS, e. g. GPS, Galileo). Due to the mitigation of interfering signals in spatial domain, they allow for better performance {{in terms of}} signal to noise plus interference ratio (SNIR). However, the <b>adaptive</b> <b>antenna</b> techniques may also introduce deviation of the array phase centre from its nominal position, which results in erroneous pseudo-range and carrier-phase measurements of the GNSS array receiver. The deviation of the array phase centre manifests itself through some additional carrier phase shifts and signal group delays caused by the <b>adaptive</b> <b>antenna</b> to the received signals. In order to control such deviations and to produce the corresponding corrections, the magnitude and phase response of the adaptive array system described by a system transfer function must be known for the directions of arrival of the satellite signals. The aim of the paper is to explain the challenge and the need of stabilizing phase centres of <b>adaptive</b> GNSS <b>antennas</b> and to detail the novel development of suitable means for controlling the phase centres. The problem of correcting for the phase centre deviation is tightly related to the calibration problem of the antenna array hardware. Indeed, in both problems the phase and amplitude distortions of an ideal array response due to the transfer characteristics of the array antenna elements and RF front-ends should be determined. Therefore, {{the solution of the}} calibration problem can be also considered as the solution for correcting for the phase centre deviations. The focus of this paper is on practical aspects of the array calibration in GNSS <b>adaptive</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>systems.</b> After introducing the system transfer function of an <b>adaptive</b> <b>antenna,</b> a model for the error propagation from the domain of code- and carrier-based pseudo-range observations of a GNSS receiver into the positioning error domain will be shortly outlined.
