40|$|AbstractArsenic in its {{organic and}} {{inorganic}} forms has threatened the human life since ages. Many researchers and scientists had made efforts {{in all the}} directions to find and remove poisonous arsenic from human surroundings. In the present study {{an attempt was made}} to see the adsorption behavior of arsenate on the chemically modified <b>artificial</b> <b>zeolite,</b> synthesized from coal fly ash. In the modification process the iron was rearranged and loaded {{on the surface of the}} fly ash by dissolution and precipitation processes. <b>Artificial</b> <b>zeolite</b> synthesized from coal fly ash was treated with iron nitrate solution. The decrease in the CEC indicates the reduction of negative charge on the zeolite structure by iron. The iron modified <b>artificial</b> <b>zeolite</b> has comparatively high capacity for arsenate adsorption which was described by the Langmuir isotherm model...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAdsorption {{experiments}} of Cs+ {{were carried}} out by using two natural zeolites, namely mordenite and clinoptilolite. The same experiments were also conducted by using synthetic zeolite A, synthetic zeolite X, and <b>artificial</b> <b>zeolite</b> Na-P 1 as references. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the potential of natural zeolites on the adsorption of radioactiveCs+. The results indicated that although cation exchange capacity of the natural zeolites was much lower compared to the synthetic and artificial zeolites, the adsorption capacity of Cs+ was much greater than the synthetic and artificial zeolites. The order of the adsorption capacity of Cs+ was mordenite>clinoptilolite> Na-P 1 >> zeolite A > zeolite X. It indicates that natural zeolites are promising materials in the removal of radioactive Cs+...|$|E
40|$|Many {{advanced}} technologies {{have been developed}} against frequent droughts or floods, {{as well as many}} traditional rainwater harvests, as terraced paddy fields, dam- constructions, reservoirs, ponds, tanks, rivers and underground pools. The major use, as two of thirds of the total, is agricultural one, but the self supply ratio of foods of Japan is about 40 % and much food is imported and wasted. It is important to build up sustainable infrastructure for water and wastewater. The <b>Artificial</b> <b>Zeolite</b> synthesized, gained from coal fly ash, which showed much effect on clarification by coagulation of suspended soils. And aeration with more smaller “micro ” size air bubbles increased oxygen in longer time into anoxic water area, that affords many livings as fishes. And this AZ showed much rain water holding in field, and a highly-qualified farmer succeeded to make about 50 % increase in marsh grass production, and high level watermelon by soil improvement and effective control of tube irrigation system. This area has been under a modern national irrigation project, and many advanced irrigation tools have been developed. With some amelioration of water quality, soil improvement and some high-level irrigation tools as spray water evenly have been developed. With urbanization, many people use water purifier and much bottled water. The examination, for gainin...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Zeolites are {{minerals}} {{that have}} intriguing properties {{such as water}} absorption, ion adsorption and cation exchange capacity. There are approximately 80 species of natural zeolites recognized and hundreds of <b>artificial</b> <b>zeolites,</b> which have been researched in several fields. Due to their chemical characteristics, zeolites have great potential for use in animal production, especially in poultry and swine farms, as food additives, litter amendment and treatment of residues, with direct and indirect effects on performance, yield and quality of carcass, ambience of farm sheds and reduction of environmental pollution...|$|R
40|$|An {{environmentally}} benign {{process was}} devel-oped for the transesterification of Jatropha curcas L. seed oil with methanol using <b>artificial</b> <b>zeolites</b> loaded with potassium acetate as a heterogeneous catalyst. After calcination for 5 h at 823 K, the catalyst loaded with 47 wt. % CH 3 COOK exhibited the highest efficiency and best catalytic activity. The easily prepared cata-lysts {{were characterized by}} means of X-ray dif-fraction and IR spectroscopy, as well as Hammett indicator titration. The results revealed a strong dependence of catalytic activity on ba-sicity. The optimum reaction conditions for transesterification of J. curcas oil were also in-vestigated. The methyl ester content in the bio-diesel product exceeded 91 % after 4 h reaction at reflux temperature {{in the presence of}} 2 % solid catalyst and no water washing process is needed during workup...|$|R
50|$|An {{ion-exchange resin}} or ion-exchange polymer is a resin or polymer {{that acts as}} a medium for ion exchange. It is an {{insoluble}} matrix (or support structure) normally in the form of small (0.25-0.5 mm radius) microbeads, usually white or yellowish, fabricated from an organic polymer substrate. The beads are typically porous, providing a large surface area on and inside them. The trapping of ions occurs along with the accompanying release of other ions, and thus the process is called ion exchange. There are multiple types of ion-exchange resin. Most commercial resins are made of polystyrene sulfonate. Ion-exchange resins are widely used in different separation, purification, and decontamination processes. The most common examples are water softening and water purification. In many cases ion-exchange resins were introduced in such processes as a more flexible alternative to the use of natural or <b>artificial</b> <b>zeolites.</b> Also, ion-exchange resins are highly effective in the biodiesel filtration process.|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 48 {{crossbred}} (Landra-ce¥Yorkshire¥Duroc) pigs (2 months old; 28. 38 ± 2. 62 kg body weight) {{were randomly assigned}} to either a control (basal diet) or 0. 5 % <b>artificial</b> <b>zeolite</b> (AZ) [basal diet + 0. 5 % AZ, dry matter (DM) basis] dietary treatment group in a completely randomized block design. Growth performance, immunity, mus-cle composition, carcass quality, faecal microflora concentration and noxious gas emissions were then investigated. No signifi-cant variation was observed in average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI) or gain:feed [kg gain/kg dry matter intake (DMI) ] ratio between treatments. The IgM and IgA levels remained unchanged, whereas the IgG level increased in the AZ dietary group rel-ative to the control (P 0. 05). Although AZ had no significant effect on fecal yeast and Lactobacillus spp. concentrations, a significant reduction was observed for Bacillus spp. in growing and E. coli both in growing and finishing pigs (P< 0. 05). Additionally, AZ supplementation led to a reduction in faecal ammonia (NH 3), sul-phur dioxide (SO 2) and hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) gases relative to the control (P< 0. 05). Based on these results, AZ had positive effects on faecal E. coli concentration and noxious gas emissions; however, further study with differ-ent levels of AZ to better understand its effects on growth performance of grower to finisher pigs is warranted...|$|E
40|$|After {{the first}} oil crisis many {{companies}} in Japan started on projects to recycle waste plastics by transforming them into oil. These projects, however, were disrupted {{after the fall}} of oil price in the successive periods of the oil crisis. This disruption was mainly caused by inefficiency of the recycling technology in those days. Recently a new technology for recycling, which uses <b>artificial</b> <b>zeolite</b> as catalyst, has been developed and an experimental plant has been constructed. Although the technology has high efficiency in transforming of waste plastics into oil, it cannot produce value added. However we have to understand the difference between the efficiency for value and for material. In this paper, we investigated on the oil efficiency of the technology. The oil efficiency was measured by the quantity of oil which was directly and indirectly necessary to produce one unit of oil by recycling wasted plastics. We use 1985 Input-Output Table and a linear programing model is constracted. Since waste plastics are produced as joint products, we cannot avoid to use linear programming models. The result showed that recycling technology had high efficiency in saving oil. If the total of the waste plastics generated in Japan would be processed by this technology, the amount of oil savings would be 7. 57 million Kl which would be 4 % of the total amount of oil used in 1985. ...|$|E

Field-emission {{scanning electron microscopy}} and nitrogen adsorption analysis were employed to study the morphologies and pore structure of the samples. Results indicate that the BET specific surface area of zeolite ore templated porous carbon (1070 m(2) /g) is {{lower than that of}} type X zeolite templated porous carbon (1820 m(2) /g) while the total pore volume (1. 39 cm(3) /g) and mesopore. volume (0. 98 cm(3) /g) of porous carbon obtained using zeolite ore as the template are much larger than that of porous carbon obtained by using type X zeolite as the template, which are 1. 02 cm(3) /g and 0. 39 cm(3) /g respectively. The nanopores of natural zeolite templated porous carbon are composed of three kinds of pores: one is formed by removal of ore which means "templated pores", the second is inherited from template pores which we call "hereditary pores" and the third is formed during carbonization.
