5|$|Betances is {{considered}} <b>a</b> <b>pioneer</b> <b>of</b> Puerto Rican liberalism. His ideas resulted from his exposure to republicanism and social activism in France {{through the middle}} part of the 19th. century.

His ideas on race relations alone had {{a major impact on}} economics and the social makeup of the island.|$|E

5|$|Masaccio {{is often}} {{compared}} to contemporaries like Donatello and Brunelleschi as <b>a</b> <b>pioneer</b> <b>of</b> the renaissance, particularly for {{his use of}} single-point perspective. One technique that was unique to Masaccio, however, {{was the use of}} atmospheric, or aerial perspective. Both the mountains in the background, and the figure of Peter on the left are dimmer and paler than the objects in the foreground, creating an illusion of depth. This technique was known in ancient Rome, but was considered lost until reinvented by Masaccio.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{was among}} the most {{influential}} jazz musicians of his lifetime.

5|$|The Ornithological Dictionary is George Montagu's best-known work, and the {{one that}} {{established}} his reputation as <b>a</b> <b>pioneer</b> <b>of</b> British ornithology.
