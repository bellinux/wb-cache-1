5|$|As the DVD {{featurette}} Within a Minute illustrates, {{the film}} required 910 artists and 70,441 man-hours to create 49 seconds of footage for the Mustafar duel alone. Members of Hyperspace, the Official Star Wars Fan Club, received a special {{look into the}} production. Benefits included not only special articles, but they also received access to a webcam that transmitted <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>image</b> every 20 seconds during {{the time it was}} operating in Fox Studios Australia. Many times the stars, and Lucas himself, were spotted on the webcam.|$|E
5|$|Krusty is {{inspired}} {{to return to}} doing low-key events, where he structures <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>image</b> for himself as a stand-up comedian who tells the truth, criticizes commercialism, and refuses to sell out to corporate America. He also changes his appearance, sporting a dark sweater and tying his hair in a ponytail. Observing his newfound popularity, two marketing executives try to persuade Krusty to endorse a new sport utility vehicle called the Canyonero. Although he tries to resist, he eventually succumbs to the lure of money. After promoting the Canyonero at a comedy performance in Moe's Tavern, he is booed off stage by the patrons. He finally admits to himself that comedy is not in his blood and selling out is. The episode ends with an extended advertisement for the Canyonero, as Krusty and Bart leave Moe's tavern in Krusty's new SUV.|$|E

25|$|In 1892 {{two events}} took place which radically changed both the {{appearance}} and outlook of Torquay: through trains were introduced, and Torquay was granted borough status by a Royal Charter, adopting the motto Salus et Felicitas (Health and Happiness).

25|$|In 1976, Frazier (32–3) fought George Foreman for {{a second}} time. With a shaved head for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>image</b> Frazier fought well enough, {{somewhat}} more restrained than usual, avoiding walking onto the big shots which he had done in their first match. However, Foreman awaited his moment and then lobbed in a tremendous left hook that lifted Frazier off his feet. After a second knock down it was stopped in the fifth. Shortly after the fight, Frazier announced his retirement.|$|E

The Pakistan title was added to the front fuselage in all raised letters and the engine cowlings were painted in beige. The PIA logo written in calligraphic Urdu was added just behind the cockpit.|$|E
25|$|In 1834, the Government of Portugal {{transferred}} the sanctuary, definitively, {{to the senate}} of Caria, followed ten years later (1844), {{with the return of}} the Church's possessions to the Bishopric of Lamego, by the Court of the Exchequer. This return had the effect of reigniting donatives and decoration in the sanctuary: in 1852, the painter Carlos Augusto Massa, from Cujó, began work on several works, in 1879, the retables were re-gilded (at a cost of 374$520 réis); issues with the azulejos, which were in deteriorating conditions, were addressed; and, in 1881, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>image</b> of Saint Anthony was purchased.|$|E

25|$|The {{buildings}} of this era reflect current attitudes toward architectural style. The International Style, with its rejection of historical tradition and its emphases on functionalism and expression of structure, {{had been in}} vogue in urban settings since the 1930s. It came late to the Carnegie campus because of the hiatus in building activity and a general reluctance among all {{institutions of higher education}} to abandon historical styles. By the 1960s, it was seen as a way to accomplish the needed expansion {{and at the same time}} give the campus <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>image.</b> Each building was a unique architectural statement that may have acknowledged the existing campus in its placement, but not in its form or materials.|$|E
25|$|The {{image is}} of a funeral {{procession}} of beings, possibly celestial, {{led by an}} angel-figure floating above the ground. The profiles of the figures suggest pre-Columbian art, and possibly an ancient Egyptian influence, as well. The angel-figure {{as well as the}} mourners have luminous peaks above their heads, in a re-imagining of halos. The shapes of the peaks are repeated by tongues of fire that point up from the bottom edge of the painting. The image strongly suggests an afterworld, {{but it is not clear}} from the image whether the environment correlates to tradition Christian understandings of heaven or hell. Xul Solar provides his viewer with <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>image</b> of an afterlife.|$|E
25|$|Jaime I's {{tenure as}} Duke of Braganza {{was one of}} {{restoration}} and grandness. Upon his return to Portugal from exile, Jaime took possession of the House's formerly confiscated properties. In order to establish <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>image</b> for the House, he ordered {{the construction of a}} new seat for the House, which would become one of the largest palaces in Iberia, the Ducal Palace of Vila Viçosa. Jaime I's restoration also continued with the House's relations with the King, Jaime I having becoming a favourite of King Manuel I and even once his temporary heir. The Duke also had his share of scandal, having funded the conquest of the city of Azamor, for the royal crown as, as punishment for his ordering the murder of his first wife, Leonor Pérez de Guzman, daughter of Juan Alfonso Pérez de Guzmán, 3rd Duke of Medina Sidonia.|$|E

25|$|In 1688, Captain Bartlomeu de Frias Coutinho, {{expressed}} {{his intention to}} enter the convent, ordering the construction of three rooms in the last dormitory of the western wing, for his spaces. On 23 February, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>image</b> of the Virgin Mary was installed in the front niche, executed by Fauger again, and in white marble which was specially ordered by his son, Father João da Madre de Deus, who ministered in the Recolhimento (religious shelter). The master sculptor also built various columns, pedestals, angels, cherubs and images (including Nossa Senhora da Piedade and São José). The artisan died in 1693, before concluding the altar for the image of Nossa Senhora da Consolação. While a resident at the convent, Father Bartolomeu de Frias Coutinho worked on improving the roads to the chapel in 1695 and decorated the sepulchre tomb, during the Paschal Triduum of Holy Week, and other small works. Upon his death in 1696, Bartolomeu's testament left all his worldly possessions to the shelter, including his books and monies, {{to be used to}} create a silver censer and chains (with leftover funds).|$|E
25|$|In 2001, Ajith {{appeared}} in three commercially successful Tamil films. Dheena, A. R. Murugadoss's debut film co-starring Laila Mehdin and Suresh Gopi, indirectly {{marked the beginning}} of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>image</b> of Ajith, that of an action hero that would appeal to the masses. Furthermore, Ajith's nickname in the film, Thala, Tamil for Leader, became a new identity for the actor amongst his fans. In the same year, he was offered a role in Nandha, which he rejected. His next was the much-hyped thriller Citizen, portraying him in ten different get-ups and it became a commercial success at the box office. A role in the family drama Poovellam Un Vasam followed opposite Jyothika and was a success commercially and critically, earning a Special Best Actor Award from the Tamil Nadu State. The year ended off with an appearance in Santosh Sivan's Hindi project Asoka, in which Ajith {{appeared in}} a brief negative role alongside Shah Rukh Khan, which did not perform well. In 2002, Ajith appeared in three films, the first two, Red and Raja being box office disappointments, the former further building up his image as an action hero. The third film Villain, in which Ajith appeared in dual roles, one as a mentally ill person, became successful and earned his second Filmfare Best Tamil Actor Award.|$|E
500|$|Rutherford's {{deep concern}} with propriety and {{feminine}} modesty should not obscure {{the fact that}} the school prepared women for more than traditional domestic roles. Lucy Cobb recognized that many of its alumnae would seek employment, and by teaching students marketable, and at the same time, respectable, skills, as well as genteel decorum and dress, Lucy Cobb created <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>image</b> of elite white single womanhood that combined aspects of the new woman and the southern belle, what I call the [...] "new belle."

The video takes influences from styles of fashion editorial and features the Sugababes in various costumes and guises. Their outfits were created with many fabrics, in addition to newspapers, plastic bin bags and florist's cellophane. Overall, there were 13 costume changes.

500|$|Claudia Puig of USA Today gave a {{negative}} review, {{stating that the}} film [...] "is trying for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>image.</b> But {{it takes more than}} an awkward title attempting to sound cool to overcome its mundane plot and silly dialogue." [...] Michael Ordona of the Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "despite the doll-like cartoonishness of the human figures, the filmmakers seem to expect us to take this animated romp seriously. Too seriously." [...] Wesley Morris of the Boston Globe called the film [...] "a junk-food pastry. The plot is the wrapper. The action is the oily sponge cake. And the message—family, family, family—is the processed cream filling." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{relevant}} {{contents of}} medical images {{can often be}} described as a composition of objects with distinct relationships. For a given setting, a generalization by the statistical distributions of regional and relational attributes can be obtained. These yield a structural prototype graph which in turn can be used for the identification of objects in <b>new</b> <b>images.</b> <b>As</b> <b>new</b> <b>image</b> contents are represented by hierarchical attributed region adjacency graphs, the task of object identification corresponds to the problem of inexact graph matching. For this purpose, the graph edit distance as well as a Hopfield-net are used and evaluated for the example application of boneidentification in hand-radiographs. The structural prototypes improve recall by 9 % and 17 %, respectively, in comparison to a traditional approach without relational information. ...|$|R
