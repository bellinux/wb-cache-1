5|$|The case of Greece {{shows that}} {{excessive}} levels of private indebtedness and <b>a</b> <b>collapse</b> of public confidence (over 90% of Greeks fear unemployment, {{poverty and the}} closure of businesses) led {{the private sector to}} decrease spending in an attempt to save up for rainy days ahead.|$|E
5|$|William Booth {{purchased}} Hadleigh Castle and {{its surrounding}} site in 1891 {{for the use of}} the Salvation Army, which established a farm to train the English poor prior to them being sent overseas to the British colonies. Considerable subsidence and slippage on the ridge occurred between 1898 and 1923, causing <b>a</b> <b>collapse</b> of the southern curtain wall.|$|E
5|$|Engineering {{requirements}} {{resulted in}} significant {{changes to the}} specification of the XJ220, most notably replacement of the Jaguar V12 engine by a turbocharged V6 engine. The changes to the specification and <b>a</b> <b>collapse</b> {{in the price of}} collectible cars brought about by the early 1990s recession resulted in many buyers choosing not to exercise their purchase options. A total of just 275 cars were produced by the time production ended, each with a retail price of £470,000 in 1992 making it their most expensive car during its debut.|$|E

5|$|England reached 3/106 by stumps on {{the fourth}} day, but the final day started poorly when Compton edged the second ball of the day—bowled by Johnston—to a diving Miller at second slip; he knocked the ball upwards before falling {{on his back and}} {{completing}} the catch as the ball went down. Just as in the first innings, Compton’s dismissal precipitated <b>a</b> <b>collapse,</b> and Australia dismissed England for 186 to complete victory by 409 runs.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{wanted to}} {{maintain}} the threat of invasion by continuing air attacks on military targets in the British capital. Hans Jeschonnek still pushed for attacks on civilian morale. He argued that military and civilian industries were located too far apart to achieve <b>a</b> <b>collapse</b> of morale by attacking the former. Instead, he pressed for attacks against residential areas. Hitler refused. He ordered that only military targets in London were to be attacked.|$|E
5|$|In the {{municipality}} of Atlamajalcingo, a woman died after <b>a</b> <b>collapse</b> of a dwelling. In Chilpancingo, {{the capital of}} Guerrero, four people perished. Numerous trees were downed and power outages were reported. Additionally, the nearby Cerrito Rico dam nearly overflowed its banks. In the Tecpan municipality, four rivers overflowed their banks and six people died because of landslides. Many mountainous communities were isolated, thus making in difficult to receive aid.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{advances}} {{have made it}} feasible to apply the stochastic variational paradigm to <b>a</b> <b>collapsed</b> representation of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). While the stochastic variational paradigm has successfully been applied to an uncollapsed representation of the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP), no attempts to apply this type of inference in <b>a</b> <b>collapsed</b> setting of non-parametric topic modeling have been put forward so far. In this paper we explore such <b>a</b> <b>collapsed</b> stochastic vari-ational Bayes inference for the HDP. The proposed online algorithm is easy to implement and accounts for the inference of hyper-parameters. First experiments show a promising improvement in predictive performance. ...|$|R

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 November 1923, a slight misjudgement {{at the end of}} the tunnel {{enlargement}} work left the tunnel unstable near Borough. <b>A</b> <b>collapse</b> on the same day, caused when a train hit temporary shoring near Elephant & Castle, filled the tunnel with wet gravel. Later a gas main exploded, causing a water main to break and leaving a water-filled crater in the middle of the street. The line was briefly split in two, but was completely closed on 28 November 1923.|$|E
5|$|Stars are {{believed}} to form {{as the result of}} <b>a</b> <b>collapse</b> of a low-temperature cloud of gas and dust. As the cloud collapses, conservation of angular momentum causes any small net rotation of the cloud to increase, forcing the material into a rotating disk. At the dense center of this disk a protostar forms, which gains heat from the gravitational energy of the collapse.|$|E
5|$|Sunday was a rest day, so {{the match}} resumed on Monday, 10 February. As {{it was a}} working day, the crowd was much smaller. Rain had fallen and the sun had baked the playing surface into a sticky wicket, which caused erratic behaviour. Nat Thomson was out for a duck without {{addition}} to the overnight total, and <b>a</b> <b>collapse</b> ensued. New South Wales made only 49 in their second innings; Bannerman top-scored with 20 while six of his colleagues failed to score, while Emmett and Ulyett took four and five wickets respectively, including four wickets in four balls for the latter. England thus won by an innings and 41 runs.|$|E

5|$|The {{fight at}} P'ohang-dong {{was the final}} {{breaking}} point for North Korean units already {{on the verge of}} exhaustion from continuous combat. North Korean supply lines were overextended to the point of breaking down, causing <b>a</b> <b>collapse</b> in resupply that is seen as a primary factor in turning the tide of the battle. Moreover, U.S. air superiority was also crucial to the engagement, since repeated bombing runs by U.S. aircraft prevented North Korean ground forces from reaching and holding their objectives.|$|E
5|$|The tunnels were {{enlarged}} {{by removing}} {{several of the}} cast iron segments from each tunnel ring, excavating a void behind to the required new diameter and reinstalling the segments with additional packing spacers. The northern section of the C between Euston and Moorgate was closed from 8 August 1922, {{but the rest of}} the line remained open with enlargement works taking place at night. <b>A</b> <b>collapse</b> on 27 November 1923 caused when a train hit temporary shoring on the incomplete excavations near Elephant & Castle station filled the tunnel with soil. The line was briefly operated in two parts, but was completely closed on 28 November 1923.|$|E
5|$|There {{was another}} {{pollution}} incident in March 2008 when twenty {{miles of the}} river turned orange. Iron oxide from old mine workings near the source at Irwell Springs had polluted the water since 1969 and in 1997 a Coal Authority survey identified the stretch as having the fourth worst case of minewater pollution in the country. A treatment plant was built in 1999 to remove the pollution {{at a cost of}} £1M; however, it is thought that there was <b>a</b> <b>collapse</b> in the mine after heavy rains in the spring of 2008. Although the water was stained with ochre, no damage to wildlife was reported.|$|E

5|$|Though oil has {{historically}} dominated the state's economy, <b>a</b> <b>collapse</b> {{in the energy}} industry during the 1980s led {{to the loss of}} nearly 90,000 energy-related jobs between 1980 and 2000, severely damaging the local economy. Oil accounted for 35 billion dollars in Oklahoma's economy in 2007, and employment in the state's oil industry was outpaced by five other industries in 2007. , the state's unemployment rate is 4.4%.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{collapse}} {{is caused}} by a weakening of the tracheal rings in the windpipe. It occurs when the rings that normally hold the shape of the windpipe collapse, closing the airway. The symptoms of <b>a</b> <b>collapse</b> include a honking cough that can sound similar to a goose honk, an intolerance to exercise, fainting spells and a cough that is worsened by hot weather, exercise and excitement. The tendency for episodes of tracheal collapse typically increases in frequency and severity as the dog ages.|$|E

After <b>a</b> <b>collapse,</b> possibly due to depression, she spent the following year in the countryside with relatives of her father, {{and the next year}} with her father in Warsaw, where she did some tutoring. Unable to enroll in a regular institution of higher education because she was a woman, she and her sister Bronisława became involved with the clandestine Flying University (sometimes translated as Floating University), a Polish patriotic institution of higher learning that admitted women students.|$|E
