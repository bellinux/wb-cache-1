5|$|For {{many years}} Odontogriphus ("toothed riddle") was known from only one specimen, an almost featureless oval smear on a slab, with hints of tiny conical teeth. However, 189 new finds {{in the years}} {{immediately}} preceding 2006 made <b>a</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>description</b> possible. It had a pair of slightly V-shaped tooth-rows just ahead of the mouth, very like Wiwaxia′s.

5|$|Baldwin {{was with}} King Henry {{shortly before the}} latter's death, taking part in {{unsuccessful}} efforts to negotiate a truce with Henry's heir, Prince Richard, who had rebelled against his father. After Henry's death, Richard sought and obtained absolution for the sin of disobedience to his father from both Baldwin and Walter de Coutances, Archbishop of Rouen. Baldwin, along with Coutances, was with Richard on 20 July 1189 at Rouen when the king was invested with the Duchy of Normandy. Baldwin crowned Richard at Westminster Abbey on 13 September 1189 in the first English coronation for which <b>a</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>description</b> survives.|$|E
5|$|Further major {{additions}} {{were made}} to the building by Sir John Hugh Smyth (1734–1802). He inherited the estate in 1783 and added the new library to the north west of the house. Sir John also asked the famous landscape designer Humphry Repton for advice about the east front of the house. Repton drafted a plan but Sir John's death halted any further work on the house. However Repton's landscape designs were implemented by Sir John's successor Sir Hugh Smyth. In his book Humphry Repton gave <b>a</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>description</b> of the old and newer parts of the house before the library additions and included a drawing of the eastern front of the house as he saw it in about 1790.|$|E

The publication also had a general description of the Oregon Country, <b>a</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>description</b> of the Willamette Valley, and included {{a copy of the}} Organic Laws of Oregon adopted by settlers at the Champoeg Meetings.

5|$|King County police, finally {{armed with}} <b>a</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>description</b> of their suspect {{as well as}} his car, posted fliers {{throughout}} the Seattle area. A composite sketch was printed in regional newspapers and broadcast on local television stations. Elizabeth Kloepfer, Ann Rule, a DES employee, and a UW psychology professor all recognized the profile, the sketch, and the car, and reported Bundy as a possible suspect; but detectives—who were receiving up to 200 tips per day—thought it unlikely that a clean-cut law student with no adult criminal record could be the perpetrator.|$|E
5|$|Similarities {{between the}} humerus of Hatzegopteryx and Quetzalcoatlus northropi have been noted; {{both have a}} long, smooth deltopectoral crest, and a {{thickened}} humeral head. These were initially {{the basis of the}} taxon's referral to the clade Azhdarchidae, but they are also similar enough to be a basis for the synonymy of Hatzegopteryx and Quetzalcoatlus. However, this is likely due to the relatively non-diagnostic nature of the humerus in giant azhdarchid taxonomy, and the lack of <b>a</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>description</b> for the elements of Q. northropi. However, the neck and jaw anatomy of Hatzegopteryx is quite clearly distinct from the smaller Q. sp., which warrants the retention of Hatzegopteryx as a taxon separate from Quetzalcoatlus.|$|E

5|$|The oxazolidinones {{have been}} known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors since the late 1950s. Their {{antimicrobial}} properties were discovered by researchers at E.I. duPont de Nemours in the 1970s. In 1978, DuPont patented a series of oxazolidinone derivatives as being effective {{in the treatment of}} bacterial and fungal plant diseases, and in 1984, another patent described their usefulness in treating bacterial infections in mammals. In 1987, DuPont scientists presented <b>a</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>description</b> of the oxazolidinones as a new class of antibiotics with a novel mechanism of action. Early compounds were found to produce liver toxicity, however, and development was discontinued.|$|E
5|$|Charles Doolittle Walcott {{found in}} the Burgess Shale nine almost {{complete}} fossils of Opabinia regalis {{and a few of}} what he classified as Opabinia media, and published a description of all of these in 1912. The generic name is derived from Opabin pass between Mount Hungabee and Mount Biddle, southeast of Lake O'Hara, British Columbia, Canada. In 1966–1967 Harry B. Whittington found another good specimen, and in 1975 he published <b>a</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>description</b> based on very thorough dissection of some specimens and photographs of these specimens lit from a variety of angles. Whittington's analysis did not cover Opabinia media: Walcott's specimens of this species could not be identified in his collection. In 1960 Russian paleontologists described specimens they {{found in the}} Norilsky region of Siberia and labelled Opabinia norilica, but these fossils were poorly preserved, and Whittington did not feel they provided enough information to be classified as members of the genus Opabinia.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Interior Department's {{rejection}} of the overall Rampart Dam project, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers continued its engineering feasibility study on the project. That plan was completed on June 25, 1971, and it included most of the previous federal documents pertaining to the project, including the electricity market studies published by the Department of the Interior in 1965, the Fish and Wildlife study of 1964, and other studies about the economic feasibility of the project. <b>A</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>description</b> of potential construction methods and the overall plan for the project were included, as were reports about the site's geography and hydrology. In total, the report encompassed two volumes including more than 480 pages. Because the construction season at the site is only five months, the Corps of Engineers projected that several decades {{would be needed to}} build the dam and associated structures.|$|E

5|$|In 2016 Natalee’s father, Dave Holloway, hired {{a private}} investigator, T.J. Ward, {{to go through}} all {{evidence}} and information related to the disappearance once more. This led to an informant named Gabriel, who claims to have been a roommate of one of Van der Sloot's closest friends named John back in 2005. Gabriel claims that John was told what happened to Natalee. Gabriel gave <b>a</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>description</b> of what happened on the night of Natalee’s disappearance {{in an interview with the}} Oxygen television channel, which created a new documentary series on Natalee's disappearance. The interview aired on Saturday, August 19, 2017. Using Gabriel's information, the investigator had found what appeared to be human bones. On October 3, 2017, DNA testing concluded that one piece of bone was human but it did not belong to Natalee.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuing}} {{search for}} Burgess Shale fossils {{since the mid-1970s}} {{has led to the}} description in the 1980s of an arthropod Sanctacaris and in 2007 of Orthrozanclus, which looked like a slug with a small shell at the front, chain mail over the back and long, curved spines round the edges. Recent digs have discovered species yet to be formally described and named. They have also unearthed more and sometimes better fossils of animals that were discovered earlier, for example Odontogriphus was for many years known from just one poorly preserved specimen, but the discovery of a further 189 formed the basis for <b>a</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>description</b> and analysis in 2006. Re-examination of Walcott's collection also continues, and has led to the reconstruction of the large marine animal Hurdia in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{first three}} {{chapters}} describe {{the various types}} of coral reef, each chapter starting with a section giving <b>a</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>description</b> of the reef Darwin had most information about, which he presents as a typical example of the type. Subsequent sections in each chapter then describe other reefs in comparison with the typical example. In the first chapter, Darwin describes atolls and lagoon islands, taking as his typical example his own detailed findings and the Beagle survey findings on the Keeling Islands. The second chapter similarly describes a typical barrier reef then compares it to others, and the third chapter gives a similar description of what Darwin called fringing or shore reefs. Having described the principal kinds of reef in detail, his finding was that the actual surface of the reef did not differ much. An atoll differs from an encircling barrier reef only in lacking the central island, and a barrier reef differs from a fringing reef only in its distance from the land and in enclosing a lagoon.|$|E
