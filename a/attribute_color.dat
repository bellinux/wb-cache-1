Multiple-feature costs have been documented previously, {{but it is not clear}} whether the multiple-feature cost arose at the selection (segregating targets from non-targets) stage predicted by the limited-resource account. The cost might instead result from a post-selection difficulty in processing or accessing the contents of the targets. By defining the targets with a selection <b>attribute</b> (<b>color)</b> that is very distinct from the attribute participants must access and report (spatial period), we were able to manipulate the selection process independently from the access stage. We still found a cost for different selection features (colors), suggesting that multiple-feature costs can arise at the selection stage. The cost was only significant however when distracters were present that shared the selection features. The cost manifested not only as greater errors or less precision in reporting the access attribute (spatial period), but also as an increased temporal lag between the physical stimuli and the reported percept. In summary, splitting selection among different features incurred little or no penalty by itself, but selection interference by distracters sharing target features could be large and could slow processing...|$|E

Children performed a cued task-switching paradigm presenting them with a cue indicating which <b>attribute,</b> <b>color</b> or shape, they should use to sort the upcoming stimulus. Following both cue and stimulus, we analyzed two event-related potentials: the P 2 and P 3, positive peaks reflecting sensory and attentional components of cognitive control, respectively. Following the cue, we also analyzed a positive slow-wave, indexing working memory engagement. We predicted that on switch trials, which required switching tasks, proactive control would result in larger cue-P 3 amplitudes, reflecting recognition {{of the need to}} switch, and larger slow-wave amplitudes, reflecting maintenance of the new task-sets over the post-cue delay. This pattern was observed in both age groups. At the stimulus, in switch trials, both age groups had shorter stimulus-P 2 latencies, consistent with processing facilitation. These results suggest that both 4 – 5 - and 7 – 8 -year-olds engaged cognitive control proactively.

O experimento foi realizado em sete propriedades, com coleta de leite em tanques de expansão e em uma destas por amostragem do lote de vacas de maior produção e de novilhas. Foram realizadas análises de composição do leite e sensorial. Os respectivos resultados foram analisados por meio da análise de variância (ANOVA) com as possíveis diferenças entre as médias (p< 0, 05) pelo teste de Tukey. Não houve efeito da estação do ano nos componentes do leite. No entanto, houve efeito de interação da estação do ano com a fazenda na proteína, lactose, sólidos totais e no extrato seco desengordurado.

We also performed an acceptance test and microbiological analysis of the formulations 10 %, 15 % and 20 %. The Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA revealed no significant differences for the parameters of the centesimal composition and energy of the four formulations, except for lipid. That is, in the process of purple yam bread making, an addition of purple yam in natura up to 20 %, instead of wheat flour in ordinary bread (0 %), can be made with no effect on the diet s energy, since their chemical composition are similar. By the DPPH method, the samples of purple yam revealed a high antioxidant activity, with values exceeding 70 %. The three purple yam breads showed some antioxidant activity with the maximum values above 40 %. The LPO method confirmed the antioxidant activity in purple yam and in purple yam breads. In both methods (DPPH and LPO), the antioxidant activity increased as the ratio of purple yam tubers, in substitution of wheat flour, was incorporated in the breads. The Friedman ANOVA was applied to compare the three formulations of purple yam breads; a significant difference only in the <b>attribute</b> <b>color</b> was revealed in the acceptance test.

40|$|Affective & Human Factors EngineeringThe {{purposes}} of this research are to identify relation between color perception and connotation of unrelated colors, and to develop mathematical models for color connotation. This research is significant {{in the sense that}} it provides fundamental data for color appearance and color connotation of unrelated colors on which there is a lack of research until now. To achieve these purposes, two psychophysical experiments were carried out. Experiment 1 : Color perception for unrelated colors, to investigate color perception for unrelated color using the 50 color stimuli beamed through a square hole. Twenty-two observers have answered their perceived magnitudes of three <b>color</b> <b>attributes</b> based on the magnitude estimation. Experiment 2 : Color connotation for unrelated colors, to examine color connotation for unrelated colors using the 50 color stimuli. Thirty-two observers have answered their connotation about each color stimulus using the 10 color connotation scales which consist of one aesthetic scale (i. e. “like – Dislike”) and nine non-aesthetic scales (i. e. “Warm – Cool,” “Heavy – Light,” “Modern – Classical,” “Clean – Dirty,” “Active – Passive,” “Hard – Soft,” Tense – Relaxed,” “Fresh – Stale,” and “Masculine – feminine”). Semantic differential method was used for measurement of color connotation scales. The color connotation models having brightness, colorfulness and hue obtained by CAM 97 u and the revised CIECAM 02 as input variables were developed to quantify inter-relation between the <b>color</b> <b>attributes</b> and <b>color</b> connotation space, and further effects of the <b>color</b> <b>attributes</b> on <b>color</b> connotation were visually analyzed based on conventional bubble charts. The major findings from the experiments are summarized as follows: In experiment 1 : Color perception for unrelated colors, the experimental results shows that the three perceptual <b>attributes</b> of unrelated <b>colors</b> such as brightness, colorfulness and hue can be estimated by the colorimetric properties of color stimuli (i. e. luminance, excitation purity and CIE 1976 hue-angle). It is found that the estimate values of the <b>color</b> <b>attributes</b> are positively proportional to perceived magnitudes of the <b>color</b> <b>attributes.</b> The performance comparison is made of proposed estimation model with CAM 97 u and revised CIECAM 02. The revised CIECAM 02 gives the best satisfactory estimations of brightness, colorfulness and hue under photopic vision. In experiment 2 : Color connotation for unrelated colors, the experimental results shows that color connotation of unrelated colors has a three-dimensional space, and the three axes are “Color solidity,” “Color heat,” and “Color purity. ” “Color solidity” is associated with “Hard-Soft,” “Heavy-Light,” “Tense-Relaxed,” and “Active-Passive. ” “Color heat” is correlated with “Warm-Cool” and “Feminine-Masculine”, and “Color purity” has relevance to “Clean-Dirty” and “Fresh-Stale. ” In short, color connotation for unrelated colors is a function of the three <b>color</b> appearance <b>attributes.</b> All the <b>color</b> connotation scales are correlated with the <b>color</b> <b>attributes.</b> Four <b>color</b> connotation scales, “Warm-Cool,” “Heavy-Light,” “Active-Passive” and “Hard-Soft”, were modeled. The scale “Warm-Cool” is associated with hue angle and colorfulness, while significant relation between “warm-Cool” and brightness is not found. The other scales are connected with the color difference between the test color and neutral color of which brightness are varied with the color connotation scales. This implies that “Heavy-Light,” “Active-Passive” and “Hard-Soft” have relevance to colorfulness. Furthermore, the three-dimensional color connotation space for unrelated colors is associated with the <b>color</b> <b>attributes.</b> The significant correlations between the axes of the color connotation space and <b>color</b> <b>attributes</b> are as follows: “Color solidity” with colorfulness, “Color heat” with both hue angle and colorfulness, “Color purity” with brightness. There is room for further improvement and development in this research. (1) The data sets obtained by this research need to examine repeatability, (2) relationships of color connotations between unrelated colors and related colors is required to be analyzed, and (3) the results of this research should expend into applications in association with emotional lighting. ope...|$|R
