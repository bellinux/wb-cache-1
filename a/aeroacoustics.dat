40|$|AIAA 2014 - 2917 <b>Aeroacoustic</b> source {{localization}} is {{an important}} experimental tool that uses an array of microphones to locate and quantify <b>aeroacoustic</b> sources. Obtaining such information {{is the first step}} towards reducing noise emissions. One emerging method of <b>aeroacoustic</b> source localization is <b>aeroacoustic</b> time-reversal. With a unique blend of numerical simula- tion and experimental data, <b>aeroacoustic</b> time-reversal has the potential to provide superior source resolution and characterization performance over other microphone array processing techniques. This paper presents an experimental comparison of three different <b>aeroacoustic</b> source localization methods: <b>aeroacoustic</b> time-reversal, beamforming and near-field acous- tic holography. The source resolution performance of all three source localization methods is investigated via a wind tunnel experimental study using two line arrays of microphones for the test case of a circular cylinder in low Mach number flow. The experimental results show that all three source localization methods are able to satisfactorily locate the cylinder noise source at the aeolian tone frequency to within λ/ 6. In addition, information about the directivity characteristics of the noise source are obtained with <b>aeroacoustic</b> time-reversal and beamforming. Zebb Prime, Akhilesh Mimani, Danielle J.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} the <b>aeroacoustic</b> noise produced by an aerofoil using experimental, computational and theoretical methods. Several different types of <b>aeroacoustic</b> noise generation mechanisms and the parameters which affect these mechanisms were identified and investigated. The aerofoils used' in this investigation all had chord lengths of 100 mm and had a maximum thickness between 18 mm and 30 mm. Experimental testing was undertaken in the low noise wind tunnel in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Canterbury with the aerofoils mounted at the exit of the tunnel. Airflow speeds from 10 m/s to 40 m/s and a range of angles of incidence were investigated. A number of modifications were made to reduce the noise and improve the operation of the wind tunnel. Different methods of measuring the <b>aeroacoustic</b> noise produced by an aerofoil were also investigated. The theory of <b>aeroacoustic</b> noise generation is described and the effect of a scattering surface on the efficiency of these <b>aeroacoustic</b> noise sources was investigated. A number of different mechanisms by which an aerofoil produces <b>aeroacoustic</b> noise were identified. These mechanisms were divided into three main categories: (1) blunt trailing edge aerofoil noise (2) sharp trailing edge aerofoil noise and (3) stalled aerofoil noise. The effect of air temperature on the production of <b>aeroacoustic</b> noise was also investigated. It was found that in most instances air temperature would have little effect on <b>aeroacoustic</b> noise generation. An extensive study of the <b>aeroacoustic</b> noise produced by a number of different aerofoils was undertaken. Modelling of the airflow over the aerofoils was used to determine the mechanism by which <b>aeroacoustic</b> noise is produced. Several different <b>aeroacoustic</b> noise generation mechanisms were identified. Theoretical models were also used to model the <b>aeroacoustic</b> noise produced by the aerofoils. Several treatments to reduce the level of <b>aeroacoustic</b> noise produced by an aerofoil were investigated. The treatments reduced the <b>aeroacoustic</b> noise produced by an aerofoil with varying degrees of success. A method for measuring the <b>aeroacoustic</b> noise produced by car roof racks mounted on the roof of a vehicle using a relatively small wind tunnel was established. The noise level produced by a roof rack installed 011 the roof of a vehicle measured using this technique compared favourably with measurements made on a full vehicle in a large wind tunnel. The method shows promise as a low cost method of accurately measuring the <b>aeroacoustic</b> noise produced by roof racks installed on a vehicle roof...|$|R

40|$|<b>Aeroacoustic</b> source {{identification}} poses some {{challenges to the}} conventional techniques such as the conventional beamforming. The challenges can be summarized as the distributed nature of the <b>aeroacoustic</b> sources, in coherent or incoherent radiation, with multipole radiation characteristics. In order to cope with these difficulties, the Generalized Inverse Beamforming (GIB) is adopted. This method allows the simultaneous identification of compact or distributed, coherent or incoherent, mono or multipole sources, with a reduced number of sensor signals. The method is applied to an <b>aeroacoustic</b> test using a simple geometry as obstacle in a low Mach number jet. The result focuses on the dipole formation on the circular cylinder surface.

40|$|A {{microphone}} is {{an instrument}} that measures an acoustic signal and generates an electrical output. Microphones have many common applications ranging from use in cellular phones and computers to high quality studio microphones for music recording. However, there is a less familiar application for microphones: microphones are utilized by commercial aircraft manufacturers {{to assist in the}} development of quiet aircraft. Communities surrounding airports object to the loud noises produced by approaching and departing aircraft. Therefore, strict regulations exist to limit the noise radiated by commercial aircraft. To reduce the noise radiation of airframes and jet engines, aircraft manufacturers perform rigorous testing during the development and qualification of their products. The microphones used for these measurements have specifications that differ greatly from a common audio microphone. The industry relies on expensive non-MEMS microphones for <b>aeroacoustic</b> measurements. To date, there have been many MEMS microphones developed; some are even successful commercial products. However, the majority are targeted for audio applications. The existing <b>aeroacoustic</b> MEMS microphones show promise; however, the performance must be improved to compete with existing non-MEMS microphones. The goal of this research is to design a MEMS-based microphone suitable for <b>aeroacoustic</b> measurements, while improving on the performance of existing devices. This study details a thorough review of previous MEMS microphones and identifies which are most suitable for <b>aeroacoustic</b> measurements. Furthermore, the specific opportunities for improvement are discussed. A thorough development of the theory of operation for capacitive microphones is presented. Using this theoretical framework, the design of an <b>aeroacoustic</b> capacitive MEMS microphone is presented.

To cover a wide Reynolds number range the experimental investigations are carried out with a 1 : 25 Inter City Express 3 model by measuring in two wind tunnels by means of microphone array technique. The facilities are the <b>Aeroacoustic</b> Wind tunnel (AWB) of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Brunswick, which provides nearly perfect acoustical conditions, and in the Cryogenic wind tunnel (DNW-KKK) of the DNW (German - Dutch wind tunnels) in Cologne, which allows measurements at higher Reynolds numbers. Two sources of sound with different characteristics are identified at Reynolds numbers up to Re = 0. 46 mio. The <b>aeroacoustic</b> noise from the bogie section is dominant for frequencies f < 5 kHz and can be characterised by cavity mode excitation. The pantograph is the dominant source of sound above f = 5 kHz with a Aeolian tone characteristic. Additionally <b>aeroacoustic</b> measurements at higher Reynolds numbers of up to 3. 70 mio have been conducted in the DNW-KKK. By cooling down one can increase the Reynolds number, and besides, this wind tunnel admits to vary the Mach and Reynolds numbers independently.
