40|$|Micromachining is {{increasingly}} continuing {{to have very}} significant impacts on national security, defense, energy, healthcare and domestic manufacturing base. Micro-parts are being utilized in the electronic and drive systems for small unmanned reconnaissance planes, for high precision parts used in missile guided systems, for medical devices to deliver medicines in tumors located in fragile internal organs, and many other significant applications. Tooling in micromachining involves endmills and drills with dimensions that make them usually invisible to the human eye. It is therefore difficult to detect tool wear, let alone tool <b>failure</b> <b>or</b> <b>breakage.</b> This problem is also compounded {{by the lack of}} machinability data {{that could be used to}} select optimum cutting conditions that minimize possibility of failure in addition to lowering the amount of wear on the tool. This paper presents a finite element analysis of the machining of aluminum T 6061 alloys. The cutting forces and temperatures are predicted using AdvantagEdge ™ software. The results are used to guide machining operators to select machining conditions that produce favorable stresses on the tools, thus avoiding tool breakage...|$|R

5000|$|The tip of an épée {{comprises}} several parts including: the mushroom-shaped movable tip; its housing or [...] "barrel", {{which is}} threaded to the blade; a contact spring; {{and a return}} spring. The tips are generally {{held in place by}} two small grub screws, which thread into the sides of the tip through elongated openings {{on either side of the}} barrel. The screws hold the tip within the barrel but are allowed to travel freely in the openings. While this is the most common system, screwless variations do exist. The return spring must allow the tip to support a force of 750 g-f N without registering a touch. Finally, an épée tip must allow a shim of 1.5 mm to be inserted between the tip and the barrel, and when a 0.5 mm shim is inserted and the tip depressed, it should not register a touch. The contact spring is threaded in or out of the tip to adjust for this distance. These specifications are tested at the start of each bout during competitions. During competitions, fencers are required to have a minimum of two weapons and two body wires in case of <b>failure</b> <b>or</b> <b>breakage.</b>|$|R
40|$|Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) {{is formed}} to share {{information}} on a temporary basis between the vehicular nodes in a wireless medium. The routing information is used to discover the vehicles and the route has to be maintained to transfer the data. It may lead to link <b>failure</b> <b>or</b> <b>breakage</b> in the communication, if there is high network mobility and constrained topology arrangement. In case of failure, it may cause loss of data and delay in the network. So, to avoid breakage, the routing information is stored in traditional protocols like CBAODV and CS-CBAODV. Instead of storing routing information in client side, the idea of storing data in the remote side is taken into consideration to backup permanently. This remote server manages the data in client server {{which is to be}} delivered to vehicular node. After analyzing related protocols and simulators, a new reactive based routing protocol is designed in this research work and it is named as RS-CBAODV is used to handle routing information between vehicular node, Client side node (RST i. e.

To analysis the performance of the proposed protocol, MOVE and NS 2 simulator is used to compare both CS-CBAODV and RS-CBAODV protocols...|$|R

The loss of network resources includes complete <b>or</b> partial <b>failure</b> of hardware and software components, power outages, scheduled maintenance such as software and hardware, operational errors such as configuration errors and acts of nature such as floods, tornadoes and earthquakes. This paper proposes a practical approach to the enhancement of QoS routing by means of providing alternative or repair paths {{in the event of}} a breakage of a working path. The proposed scheme guarantees that every Protected Node (PN) is connected to a multi-repair path such that no further <b>failure</b> <b>or</b> <b>breakage</b> of single <b>or</b> double repair paths can cause any simultaneous loss of connectivity between an ingress node and an egress node. Links to be protected in an MPLS network are predefined and an LSP request involves the establishment of a working path. The use of multi-protection paths permits the formation of numerous protection paths allowing greater flexibility. Our analysis will examine several methods including single, double and multi-repair routes and the prioritization of signals along the protected paths to improve the Quality of Service (QoS), throughput, reduce the cost of the protection path placement, delay, congestion and collision...|$|R
50|$|Contentment versus {{satisfaction}}. Life satisfaction {{has been}} stressed {{over the past}} four decades in Western psychological literature on mental health. Life satisfaction is believed in the Western thought to result from need or desire satisfaction. However, contentment, in non-Western cultures, involves satisfaction as well as many other qualities and experiences. It is understood as a delicate balance between joy and sorrow that should be preserved in both happy and sad times. It involves accepting <b>any</b> <b>failure</b> <b>or</b> misery one faces with composure, dignity, and gracefulness. This sense of contentment is believed to result from the realization of the transcendent self. Whereas the contentment is spiritually loaded, life satisfaction is not associated with morality and spirituality.|$|R

The proposed scheme guarantees that every Protected Node (PN) is connected to a multi-repair path such that no further <b>failure</b> <b>or</b> <b>breakage</b> of single <b>or</b> double repair paths can cause any simultaneous loss of connectivity between an ingress node and an egress node. Links to be protected in an MPLS network are predefined and a Label Switched path (LSP) request involves the establishment of a working path. The use of multi-protection paths permits the formation of numerous protection paths allowing greater flexibility. Our analysis examined several methods including single, double and multi-repair routes and the prioritization of signals along the protected paths to improve the Quality of Service (QoS), throughput, reduce the cost of the protection path placement, delay, congestion and collision. Results obtained indicated that creating multi-repair paths and prioritizing packets reduces delay and increases throughput in which case the delays at the ingress/egress LSPs were low compared to when the signals had not been classified. Therefore the proposed scheme provided a means to improve the QoS in path restoration in MPLS using available network resources. Prioritizing the packets in the data plane has revealed that the amount of traffic transmitted using a medium and low priority Label Switch Paths (LSPs) does not have any impact on the explicit rate of the high priority LSP in which case the problem of a knock-on effect is eliminated...|$|R

5000|$|Traditional sewage pumping {{stations}} incorporate both a {{wet well}} and a [...] "dry well". Often {{these are the}} same structure separated by an internal divide. In this configuration pumps are installed below ground level on the base of the dry well so that their inlets are below water level on pump start, priming the pump and also maximising the available NPSH. Although nominally isolated from the sewage in the wet well, dry wells are underground, confined spaces and require appropriate precautions for entry. Further, <b>any</b> <b>failure</b> <b>or</b> leakage of the pumps or pipework can discharge sewage directly into the dry well with complete flooding not an uncommon occurrence. As a result, the electric motors are normally mounted above the overflow, top water level of the wet well, usually above ground level, and drive the sewage pumps through an extended vertical shaft. To protect the above ground motors from weather, small pump houses are normally built, which also incorporate the electrical switchgear and control electronics. These are the visible parts of a traditional sewage pumping station although they are typically smaller than the underground wet and dry wells.|$|R
