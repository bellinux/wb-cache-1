5|$|At present, there <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> {{to get to}} Arad: by air or road. The only highway {{connecting}} Arad {{with the}} rest of the country is Highway 31, which connects it with Beersheba to the west, and the Dead Sea to the east. It has two junctions within Arad's municipal area—the Arad Junction (within the city itself, with Road 3199), and the Tel Arad Junction (with Highway 80). The local Road 3199 connects Arad with Masada, but does not connect to the road next to the dead sea (Highway 90). It is therefore the only way to get to Masada's western side.|$|E
5|$|There <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> {{to get to}} Lundy, {{depending}} {{on the time of}} year. In the summer months (April to October) visitors are carried on the Landmark Trust's own vessel, MS Oldenburg, which sails from both Bideford and Ilfracombe. Sailings are usually three days a week, on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, with additional sailings on Wednesdays during July and August. The voyage takes on average two hours, {{depending on}} ports, tides and weather. The Oldenburg was first registered in Bremen, Germany in 1958 and has been sailing to Lundy since her engine was replaced in 1985.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} in Days of Ruin {{is for the}} player to use their military force to defeat the enemy's force. Except for certain single player missions with special objectives, there <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> to defeat an opponent: destroy all of the enemy's units or capture their headquarters. The battle system is turn-based. Two to four forces, each headed by a commanding officer (CO), take turns building and commanding units on grid-based maps. Every turn, units, which consist of ground, sea and air units, can move across {{the different types of}} terrain and attack enemy units or perform other actions, such as submerging a submarine or resupplying friendly units. Many factors can affect the battle, such as Fog of War, a phenomenon that prevents players from seeing enemy units other than those in the visual range of their units; various weather conditions; and CO powers.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that white dwarfs with surface temperatures of less than 10,000 kelvins could harbor a habitable zone {{at a distance of}} c. 0.005 to 0.02 AU that would last upwards of 3 billion years. The goal is to search for transits of hypothetical Earth-like planets that could have migrated inward and/or formed there. As a white dwarf has a size similar to that of a planet, these kinds of transits would produce strong eclipses. Newer research casts some doubts on this idea, given that the close orbits of those hypothetical planets around their parent stars would subject them to strong tidal forces that could render them unhabitable by triggering a greenhouse effect. Another suggested constraint to this idea is the origin of those planets. Leaving aside in-situ formation on an accretion disk surrounding the white dwarf, there <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> a planet could end in a close orbit around stars of this kind: by surviving being engulfed by the star during its red giant phase, and then spiraling towards its core, or inward migration after the white dwarf has formed. The former case is implausible for low-mass bodies, as they are unlikely to survive being absorbed by their stars. In the latter case, the planets would have to expel so much orbital energy as heat, through tidal interactions with the white dwarf, that they would likely end as uninhabitable embers.|$|E
5|$|The {{practical}} side of Hadley's proposal {{rests on}} two key principles: a guardianship system, {{according to which}} knowledgeable guardians would be appointed to represent animal property holders in land management decision-making, {{and the use of}} animals' territory-marking behaviour to determine the limits of their property. Hadley rejects first occupancy and labour-mixing accounts of appropriation, and instead suggests that there <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> that his account might fruitfully be justified. First, it might be justified directly, with reference to the interests of animals. This relies upon the fact that wild animals require their territory in order to satisfy their basic needs and the claim that this results in an interest in territory strong enough to ground a right. If animals have a right to use their territory, Hadley claims, then they necessarily have a property right in that territory. Second, it might be justified indirectly, as animals (of some species, at least) might be given property rights as a means of protecting natural environments. Hadley presents his proposal against the backdrop of an explicit pragmatism, and holds that animal property rights theory has the potential to reconcile animal and environmental ethics.|$|E
