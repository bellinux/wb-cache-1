The riddle is solved when looking at a company catalog (leaflet) that zooms out showing a clown complete with ruffles and a tall pointed hat and carrying a Fun Ho! sign (Jordan 2015). The clown was most often printed in red, and was even used for company Christmas cards once upon a time (Jordan 2015). The logo was probably OK from the 1930s through the 1960s, but as an <b>advertising</b> <b>gimmick,</b> the design would probably would not work well with children today.|$|E

MCI had also unknowingly been drawn into the fray by running a TV commercial {{a couple of weeks}} after the incident advertising how the Bobbitts, a family from Siasconset, Massachusetts (of no relation to the Bobbitts of Manassas, Virginia) saved by switching to MCI, causing jokes to be made of [...] "when they cut off your service, they mean it".|$|R

2500|$|Far more {{mercury is}} {{released}} when amalgam fillings are removed than over their entire lifetime if left undisturbed. This {{led to some}} dentists who advocate removal of amalgam fillings (who may describe themselves as [...] "holistic dentists") to develop special techniques to counter this, such as wearing breathing apparatus, using high-volume aspiration, and performing the procedure as quickly as possible. The impact of such techniques on the dose of mercury received during filling removal is unknown, and the techniques have been criticized as merely <b>advertising</b> <b>gimmicks</b> which enable such dentists to charge {{far more than a}} normal dentist would for the same procedure. Sources of mercury from the diet, and the potential harm of the composite resins (which mimic female sex hormones) [...] to replace the purportedly harmful amalgam fillings, are also ignored by these dentists.|$|R

5000|$|Thalberg's {{financial}} success on these tours was immense. He got {{an average of}} about $500 per concert and probably made more than $150,000 during his two seasons, the equivalent today of about $3 million. A large part of his appeal on these tours was his unpretentious and unassuming personality; he did not resort to <b>advertising</b> <b>gimmicks</b> or cheap crowd-pleasing tricks, instead offering superbly polished renditions of his own compositions, which had already been well known in America. On rising from the piano, he was always the same quiet, respectable, self-possessed, middle-aged gentleman that he was at the dinner table of his hotel. He played works by Beethoven, among them the sonatas op. 27 no. 2 ("Moonlight") and op.26 ("Funeral March") as well as the first movements of the Third and Fifth Piano Concertos. His cadenza to Beethoven's third concerto was admired. He also played works by Bach, Chopin, Hummel, Mendelssohn and several other composers.

In the midst of a freak storm, Lard Lad and other giant advertising statues come to life to terrorize Springfield. Homer eventually returns the doughnut to Lard Lad, but that does not stop Lard Lad and his friends from causing destruction. Lisa goes to the ad agency that created those advertising characters, and an executive suggests the citizens stop paying attention to the monsters as they are <b>advertising</b> <b>gimmicks,</b> and attention is what keeps them motivated. He suggests a jingle will help distract people from watching the monsters. Lisa and Paul Anka later perform a catchy song and the citizens of Springfield stop looking at the monsters, who lose their powers and become lifeless.|$|R
30|$|According to Korn Ferry’s latest study, {{consumer}} {{companies that}} focused their employees on the organization’s purpose boasted annual growth rates that were nearly triple the annual {{rate for the}} whole sector. And the benefits go beyond financial. The {{study also found that}} having an authentic purpose can help recruit and retain talent, win over customers, and have positive impacts on broader society (Korn Ferry Institute, 2016). The study, called “People on a mission” examined a broad set of purpose-driven organizations, including interviews with 30 founders, CEOs, and senior executives at consumer companies with visible and authentic purposes, engaged employees, customer-oriented cultures, and strong financial results. “We have found that organizations that take the challenging steps to define their core purpose and values, and integrate these throughout their operations - beyond slogans or <b>advertising</b> <b>gimmicks</b> - see not only strong bottom-line results, they also find this approach transforms all aspects of their business,” said Elaine Dinos, principal of Korn Ferry’s Global Consumer Market practice. “When an organization has a clear purpose, it unleashes the power and drive of the entire workforce, harnessing and focusing that combined effort in one aligned direction.” Indeed, the study found that companies with the proper focus posted compounded annual growth rates of 9.85 % compared to a 2.4 % for the whole S&P 500 Consumer Sector.|$|R

5000|$|Parliament is a {{brand of}} {{cigarettes}} marketed by the company Philip Morris. The brand was introduced in 1931 and is distinctive for its recessed paper filters. It was originally used as an <b>advertising</b> <b>gimmick</b> when cigarettes did not have filters. The first commercial cigarette filters came into use in 1935. [...] Cigarette filters became common in most cigarettes in the 1950s. In the 1940s and 1950s, the brand was marketed for its unique filters, with advertisements reading, [...] "Only the flavor touches your lips", and [...] "Tobacco tastes best when the filter's recessed". The brand also claimed that the recessed filter prevented tar from making contact with the smoker's mouth, unlike standard filters. The Parliament brand holds a strong market position in Georgia, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Argentina, Armenia, Israel, South Korea, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Russia, Montenegro, Ukraine and United States.|$|E

50|$|Aunt Jemima {{embodied}} {{an early}} twentieth century idealized domesticity that was inspired by old southern hospitality. There were others that capitalized on this theme, such as Uncle Ben's Rice and Cream of Wheat’s Rastus. The backdrop to the trademark image of Aunt Jemima is a romanticized view of antebellum plantation life. The myth surrounding Aunt Jemima's secret recipe, family life, and plantation life as a happy slave contributes to the post civil war idealism of southern life and America's developing consumer culture. Early advertisements used an Aunt Jemima paper doll family as an <b>advertising</b> <b>gimmick</b> to buy the product. Aunt Jemima is represented with her husband, Rastus, whose name was later changed to Uncle Mose to avoid confusion with the Cream of Wheat character, and their five children: Abraham, Lincoln, Dilsie, Zeb, and Dinah. The doll family was barefoot and dressed in tattered clothing with the possibility to see them transform from rags to riches by buying another box with civilized clothing cut-outs.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{though his}} <b>advertising</b> <b>gimmick</b> {{had worked as}} the novel was a bestseller, Wallace {{discovered}} that instead of his woefully over-optimistic three months, FJM would have to continue selling consistently with no margin of error for two full years to recoup the £2,500 he had mistakenly believed he needed to break even. Unfortunately during this period the number of entrants correctly guessing the right answer continued to rise inexorably. Wallace's response was to simply ignore the situation, but circumstances were ominous. As 1906 began and continued without any list of prize winners being printed, more and more suspicions were being voiced about the honesty of the competition. In addition, for a working-class Edwardian family, £250 was a fortune and since those who were winners knew it (courtesy of the published solution) they had been waiting impatiently for the prize to be paid out. Harmsworth, having refused the initial £1,000 loan, was furious at having now to loan over £5,000 to protect the newspaper's reputation because Wallace couldn't pay.|$|E
50|$|The {{science of}} lighter-than-air gasses, and {{specifically}} {{the properties of}} oxygen, had been discovered as early as 1774 by Joseph Priestley, who noted its lightness and explosive qualities when heated. The chemistry of lighter-than-air and heated gasses was eventually {{put to the test}} by the Montgolfier brothers, two paper manufacturers in France, while experimenting with heated air caught in paper bags.Balloonomania saw its true origins, however, in the very first public balloon flight on June 5, 1783, with the launching of a large unmanned paper balloon in the countryside near Annonay. The balloon, which had been constructed by the Mongolfier brothers, was thirty feet tall, made of paper and appears to have been intended as an <b>advertising</b> <b>gimmick</b> for the Montgolfier’s paper manufacturing company. It was effective, as it drew an enormous crowd of onlookers.Later balloonists such as Jean-Pierre Blanchard and Vincent Lunardi exploited this wonder at the novelty of balloons to draw large crowds and gain personal fame, Lunardi {{going so far as to}} proclaim himself an “idol of the whole nation England” in a letter to his guardian.|$|E
50|$|In 1938 Tabb built a 15 inch bicycle as {{his father}} used to do, to hang outside his shop as an <b>advertising</b> <b>gimmick.</b> Curious {{as to whether he}} could ride the bike he tried and found with a little {{practice}} he could ride the cycle. He was then encouraged to perform his act at the local gliderdrome. This spurred Tabb to make further miniature cycles including an 18 inch tandem and a miniature penny farthing which had a 12 inch front wheel. Tabb, his daughter Peggy and grand daughter Pauline then performed acts of trick cycling to television audiences in the UK and America on TV. He also set a world record for an unchallenged riding a 12 inch miniature cycle. For over 40 years nobody could beat Tabb by riding the 12 inch cycle more than five yards. He was interviewed by a young Chris Tarrant on ATV in 1972 aged 89. His last official performance was at a mayor's ball in 1974 where at the age of 91 he was still able to ride his 12 inch miniature bike. Tabb died in 1976 aged 96.Since his death a road in Kidderminster, Tabb's Gardens, has been named in his honour.|$|E
