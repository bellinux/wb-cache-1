5|$|With {{the end of}} the Western Roman Empire, domes {{became a}} {{signature}} feature of the church architecture of the surviving Eastern Roman Empire. A transition from timber-roofed basilicas to vaulted churches seems to have occurred between the late 5th century and the 7th century, with early examples in Constantinople, Asia Minor, and Cilicia. The first known domed basilica may have been a church at Meriamlik in southern Turkey, dated to between 471 and 494, although the ruins do not provide a definitive <b>answer.</b> <b>It</b> is possible earlier examples existed in Constantinople, where {{it has been suggested that}} the plan for the Meriamlik church itself was designed, but no domed basilica has been found there before the 6th century.|$|E

This is a non-trivial result, and is proved below. The following proof is taken from Halmos's A Hilbert Space Problem Book (see the references).|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time Big Brother Australia {{featured}} a telephone in the house. It was situated in the lounge and was shown on the Opening Night broadcast before the housemates entered the house. On Day 37, Big Brother informed housemates that if the phone rang only one housemate could <b>answer</b> <b>it.</b> Joel was nominated to <b>answer</b> <b>it</b> on the housemates' behalf. On Day 52 Joel {{received a call from}} Big Brother advising that he would be away from the house and would communicate via the phone to Joel at various times. On Day 58 Andrew picked up the phone as a joke, and was penalised by being sent to the Punishment Room to polish boots. Michelle joined him in the Punishment Room due to the weekly task which involved housemates remaining partnered.|$|E

25|$|The {{right to}} a fair hearing {{requires}} that individuals should not be penalized by decisions affecting their rights or legitimate expectations unless they have been given prior notice of the case, a fair opportunity to <b>answer</b> <b>it,</b> {{and the opportunity to}} present their own case. The mere fact that a decision affects rights or interests is sufficient to subject the decision to the procedures required by natural justice. In Europe, the {{right to a}} fair hearing is guaranteed by Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is said to complement the common law rather than replace it.|$|E
25|$|In Unscramble this Picture Puzzle, a 3 by 3 or a 4 by 4 sliding puzzle {{is shown}} on the screens, later it became a 5 by 5 sliding puzzle. The puzzle can be a person, a place or an object. When a team buzzes in, the puzzle freezes. The first team to {{identify}} the puzzle gets 10 points for their team and the puzzle is instantly revealed to the audience. If they get it wrong, no points are deducted but they get locked out allowing the other teams to <b>answer</b> <b>it.</b> If all three teams fail to identify the puzzle (scrambled or not), no points are given out {{and the answer is}} revealed.|$|E
25|$|The cue {{familiarity}} {{hypothesis was}} proposed by Reder and Ritter after completing {{a pair of}} experiments which indicated that individuals can evaluate their ability {{to answer a question}} before trying to <b>answer</b> <b>it.</b> This finding suggests that the question (cue) and not the actual memory (target) is crucial for making metamemory judgments. Consequently, this hypothesis implies that judgements regarding metamemory are based on an individual’s level of familiarity with the information provided in the cue. Therefore, an individual is more likely to judge that they know the answer to a question if they are familiar with its topic or terms and more likely to judge that they do not know the answer to a question which presents new or unfamiliar terms.|$|E

25|$|Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood (also {{known as}} Ode, Immortality Ode or Great Ode) is {{a poem by}} William Wordsworth, {{completed}} in 1804 and published in Poems, in Two Volumes (1807). The poem was completed in two parts, with the first four stanzas written among a series of poems composed in 1802 about childhood. The {{first part of the}} poem was completed on 27 March 1802 and a copy was provided to Wordsworth's friend and fellow poet, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who responded with his own poem, , in April. The fourth stanza of the ode ends with a question, and Wordsworth was finally able to <b>answer</b> <b>it</b> with 7 additional stanzas completed in early 1804. It was first printed as Ode in 1807, and it was not until 1815 that it was edited and reworked to the version that is currently known, Ode: Intimations of Immortality.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{one answer}} from modern science to give. What the {{original}} question now means indeed depends on choosing genus or species in the required <b>answer.</b> <b>It</b> is thought that the genus of man {{has been around for}} ten times as long as our species. Currently, fresh examples of (extinct) species of the genus Homo are still being discovered, so that definitive answers are not available. The consensus view is that human beings are one species, the only existing species of the genus. With the rejection of polygenism for human origins, it is asserted that this species had a definite and single origin in the past. (That assertion leaves aside the point whether the origin meant is of the current species, however. The multiregional hypothesis allows the origin to be otherwise.) The hypothesis of recent African origin of modern humans is now widely accepted, and states that anatomically modern humans had a single origin, in Africa.|$|E
25|$|According to {{classical}} rabbinical literature, {{in order for}} the Urim and Thummim to give an <b>answer,</b> <b>it</b> was first necessary for the individual to stand facing the fully dressed high priest, and vocalise the question briefly and in a simple way, though it was not necessary for it to be loud enough for anyone else to hear it. The Talmudic rabbis argued that Urim and Thummim were words written on the sacred breastplate. Most of the Talmudic rabbis, and Josephus, following the belief that Urim meant lights, argued that divination by Urim and Thummim involved questions being answered by great rays of light shining out of certain jewels on the breastplate; each jewel was taken to represent different letters, and the sequence of lighting thus would spell out an answer (though there were 22 letters in the Hebrew alphabet, and only 12 jewels on the breastplate); two Talmudic rabbis, however, argued that the jewels themselves moved {{in a way that made}} them stand out from the rest, or even moved themselves into groups to form words.|$|E

500|$|Douglas made no {{immediate}} {{response to the}} Pink Sheet, despite the advice of Mrs. Roosevelt, who appreciated its power and urged her to <b>answer</b> <b>it.</b> Douglas later stated that she had failed to understand {{the appeal of the}} Pink Sheet to voters, and simply thought it absurd. Nixon followed up on the Pink Sheet with a radio address on September 18, accusing Douglas of being [...] "a member of a small clique which joins the notorious communist party-liner Vito Marcantonio of New York, in voting time after time against measures that are for the security of this country". He assailed Douglas for advocating that Taiwan's seat on the United Nations Security Council be given to the People's Republic of China, as appeasement towards communism.|$|E

And then we would too quickly <b>answer</b> <b>it</b> and [...] the tension. And we've tried to course-correct and have the tease promise" [...] questions that don't get answered right away. He further elaborated that the goal now is to [...] "have the energy of the show get bigger as [...] goes along... We're learning how to tell this version of a detective story. It's not really a police procedural. There are elements of that. But it's an incredible mish-mash of genres. I think we're getting better at finding our way through these stories." ...|$|E

500|$|On graduation, Ching-teng enrolls at the National Chiao Tung University. Chia-Yi, {{who did not}} do well on the {{admission}} exam because she was ill on that day, only manages to enter the National Taipei University of Education with her mediocre test results. Depressed and upset, she is consoled by Ching-teng, who calls her long-distance almost every night from the university. During the winter holiday season that year, the two go on their first [...] "date", during which Ching-teng asks Chia-yi if she loves him. However, fearing she would say no, he decides that he would rather not hear her <b>answer</b> (<b>it</b> is revealed later that her reply would have been [...] "yes"). Ching-teng later organizes a fight night and invites Chia-yi to watch, hoping to impress her with his [...] "strength". On the contrary, Chia-yi finds it childish for Ching-teng to injure himself for no reason. This upsets Ching-teng, sparking a quarrel that causes the two to break up.|$|E
500|$|Hunt's songwriting on {{the album}} is {{characterized}} by resolute lyrics, multi-layered storylines, social commentary, a droll perspective, poetic subtlety, thematic subtext, and whimsy. Songs {{on the album}} are unified by a theme of tension and dissonance in modern life. The songs explore topics and issues in contemporary society and culture, including gentrification, identity politics, and mass consumption, accompanied {{by a sense of}} hope in Hunt's lyrics. Hunt explains the album to have a [...] "loose concept", with songs unified by subject matter concerning [...] "unspoken issues around society", and says of his lyrical sentiments on the album, [...] "It fits my personality that no matter what's going on I'm going to <b>answer</b> <b>it</b> honestly with a wink and a smile. As cliché as it might be, I feel like every situation needs a laugh." [...] L. Michael Gipson of Creative Loafing notes David Bowie and Lenny Kravitz as references points for Hunt's songwriting, and writes that What Were You Hoping For? explores [...] "both sides of the political aisles" [...] with metaphorical songs such as [...] "North Hollywood", [...] "Designer Jeans", and the title track, as well as themes concerning an intimate relationship with the songs [...] "Moving Targets", [...] "Falls (Violet)", and [...] "Cross Dresser".|$|E
500|$|When Jefferson took office, {{he moved}} {{as quickly as}} {{possible}} to fill his cabinet positions. Although he had asked James Madison to be his Secretary of State, Madison did not arrive in Washington until May 1, 1801, due to illness. In the interim, Jefferson asked Lincoln to act temporarily as Secretary of State, which he did from March 5, 1801, until Madison assumed his duties on May 2. During this time, Lincoln was involved in actions that led to the celebrated Marbury v. Madison case concerning judicial review. In the later days of the John Adams administration, the President issued a large number of commissions, some of which had not been delivered by John Marshall, his Secretary of State, at the time Jefferson assumed office. Jefferson ordered Lincoln (in his capacity as acting Secretary of State), and then Madison (after his assumption of the position) not to deliver these commissions. Some intended recipients of these commissions, William Marbury among them, filed a suit in the United States Supreme Court to compel their delivery. In his role as Attorney General, Lincoln was present at the preliminary hearing on the case, representing Madison. When the case was heard (ironically by a court headed by John Marshall, the preparer of the commissions), Lincoln was called to the stand by Marbury's attorney, former Attorney General Charles Lee. Rather than answer Lee's questions, Lincoln invoked both executive privilege and the Fifth Amendment, requesting the opportunity to consider whether or not to answer the questions. The justices granted him time, but {{made it clear that he}} must either answer the questions or clearly justify his objections to specific written questions. When Lincoln returned the next day, he answered all of the posed questions but one. Asked [...] "hat had been done with the commissions", Lincoln refused to answer directly, only stating that he did not know if Madison ever received them. The opposition press criticized Lincoln for this performance, writing that he [...] "was asked a simple question, but could not <b>answer</b> <b>it</b> until they gave it to him in writing, [...] and then he made out to remember that he had forgot all about it".|$|E
