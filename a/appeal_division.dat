25|$|In 1971, Parliament {{passed the}} Federal Court Act which {{abolished}} the Exchequer Court {{and created a}} new court, the Federal Court of Canada. That Court had two divisions: the Federal Court – Trial Division, and the Federal Court – <b>Appeal</b> <b>Division.</b> Although the two divisions had different functions, they were {{all part of a}} single court.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Parliament passed {{legislation}} which divided the Federal Court into two courts. The Federal Court – Trial Division became the Federal Court of Canada, while the Federal Court – <b>Appeal</b> <b>Division</b> became the Federal Court of Appeal. The {{jurisdiction of the}} two new courts {{is essentially the same}} as the corresponding former divisions of the Federal Court.|$|E

2500|$|Appeals {{from these}} courts are heard {{either by the}} {{superior}} court of the province or territory or by the Court of Appeal. In criminal cases, this depends on {{the seriousness of the}} offence. These courts are created by provincial statute and only have the jurisdiction granted by statute. Accordingly, inferior courts do not have inherent jurisdiction. These courts are usually the successors of older local courts presided over by lay magistrates and justices of the peace who did not necessarily have formal legal training. However, today all judges are legally trained, although justices of the peace may not be. Many inferior courts have specialized functions, such as hearing only criminal law matters, youth matters, family law matters, small claims matters, [...] "quasi-criminal" [...] offences (i.e., violations of provincial statutes), or bylaw infractions. In some jurisdictions these courts serve as an <b>appeal</b> <b>division</b> from the decisions of administrative tribunals.|$|E
2500|$|The civil {{division}} of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales later found in 1982 that the British parliament could have legislated for a Dominion simply by including in any new law a clause claiming the Dominion cabinet had requested and approved of the act, whether that was true or not. Further, the British parliament was not obliged to fulfil a Dominion's request for legislative change. Regardless, in 1935 the British parliament refused to consider {{the result of the}} Western Australian secession referendum of 1933 without the approval of the Australian federal parliament. In 1937, the <b>Appeal</b> <b>Division</b> of the Supreme Court of South Africa ruled unanimously that a repeal of the Statute of Westminster in the United Kingdom would have no effect in South Africa, stating: [...] "We cannot take this argument seriously. Freedom once conferred cannot be revoked." [...] Others in Canada upheld the same position.|$|E
