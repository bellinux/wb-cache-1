40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} analysis of the effect of fluorination on the conformation of perfluorosuccinic acid in the solid state, using database analysis, crystal structure determination, and computational analysis of molecular conformations. Our results indicate that perfluorosuccinic acid exhibits strikingly different conformational preferences to its hydrocarbon analogue despite similarity in molecular size. This difference in conformational behavior also extends to the pair of <b>adipic</b> and perfluoroadipic <b>acids.</b> A search of the Cambridge Structure Database indicates that our analysis is valid for neutral molecules, salts, cocrystals, and metal?organic materials, suggesting fluorination as a general means to modify the shape of a molecular building block without changing its size. The difference in molecular shape between hydrocarbon and perfluorocarbon molecules is expected to lead to significant differences in solid-state structures of the resulting materials. We illustrate this by comparing the structures of new multicomponent crystals involving the model pharmaceutical ingredient caffeine and perfluorosuccinic or perfluoroadipic acid with the structures of analogous crystals based on the hydrocarbon diacids. Unlike hydrocarbon-based succinic and <b>adipic</b> <b>acids</b> which provide structurally similar hydrogen-bonded cocrystals and inclusion hosts with caffeine, perfluorosuccinic acid provides a salt and perfluoroadipic acid yields a cocrystal. Combined crystal structure analysis, solid-state and solution NMR analysis, single molecule conformational analysis, and calculations of acid dissociation energies indicate that the different solid-state behaviors of perfluoro- and hydrocarbon acids toward caffeine should be interpreted {{as a result of their}} distinct conformational properties rather than differences in pKa values...|$|R

The co-reactant used for the Imron 2.1 topcoats seem richer in polyester resins. The intense peak seen at 7.73  min in the pyrograms of Imron 2.1 is caprolactone, a compound widely used in coating industry to prepare polyester resins for high-solids coatings [6].

Despite the similarity between PAA and DAA, it is surprising that the lowest energy structure of PAA is predicted to have (H(2) O center dot center dot center dot H center dot center dot center dot OH(2)) (+) Zundel-like symmetric hydrogen bonding, whereas that of DAA has H(3) O(+) Eigen-like asymmetric hydrogen bonding. The energy profiles show that direct proton transfer between mirror image structures is unfavorable. Instead, the chiral transformation is possible by subsequent backbone twistings through stepwise proton transfer along multistep intermediate structures, which are Zundel-like ions for PAA and Eigen-like ions for DAA. This type of chiral transformation by multistep intramolecular proton transfers is unprecedented. Several prominent OH center dot center dot center dot O short hydrogen-bond stretching peaks are predicted in the range of 1000 - 1700 cm(- 1) in the Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics (CPMD) simulations, which show distinctive signatures different from ordinary hydrogen-bond peaks.

Esterification of isoquercitrin was accomplished by direct chemoenzymatic reaction using Novozym 435 (lipase from Candida antarctica), which accepted C 5 - to C 12 -dicarboxylic acids; the shorter ones, such as oxalic (C 2), malonic (C 3), succinic (C 4) and maleic (C 4) acids were not substrates of the lipase. Lipophilicity of monocarboxylic acid derivatives, measured as log P, increased with the chain length. Esters with glutaric and <b>adipic</b> <b>acids</b> exhibited hydrophilicity, and the dodecanedioic acid hemiester was more lipophilic. All derivatives were less able to reduce Folin–Ciocalteau reagent (FCR) and scavenge DPPH (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl) than isoquercitrin; ABTS (2, 2 ′-azinobis-(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid)) radical-scavenging activity was comparable. Dodecanoate and palmitate were the least active in FCR and ABTS scavenging; dodecanoate and hemiglutarate were the strongest DPPH scavengers. In contrast, most derivatives were much better inhibitors of microsomal lipoperoxidation than isoquercitrin; butyrate and hexanoate were the most efficient. Anti-lipoperoxidant activity of monocarboxylic derivatives, except acetates, decreased with increasing aliphatic chain.

The differential aerosol sizing and hygroscopicity spectrometer probe (DASH-SP) employs differential mobility analysis in-concert with multiple humidification and optical sizing steps to determine dry optical size and hygroscopic growth factors for size-selected aerosols simultaneously at three elevated relative humidities. The DASH-SP has been designed especially for aircraft-based measurements, with time resolution as short as a few seconds. The minimum particle diameter detected with 50 % efficiency in the optical particle counters (OPCs) is 135 ± 8 nm, while the maximum detectable particle diameter is in excess of 1 μm. An iterative data processing algorithm quantifies growth factors and “effective” refractive indices for humidified particles using an empirically derived three-dimensional surface (OPC pulse height–refractive index–particle size), based on a calculated value of the “effective” dry particle refractive index. Excellent agreement is obtained between DASH-SP laboratory data and thermodynamic model predictions for growth factor dependence on relative humidity for various inorganic salts.

Other long-chain dicarboxylic acids did not change the OF in rat RBCs.

Benzene- 1, 2, 3 -tricarboxylic acid, but not benzene- 1, 3, 5 -tricarboxylic acid, also decreased the OF in rat RBCs. On the other hand, monocarboxylic acids possessing 2 to 7 straight hydrocarbons and benzoic acid increased the OF in rat RBCs. In short-chain dicarboxylic acids, {{a limited number of}} hydrocarbons between the two carboxylic groups are thought to form a V- or U-shaped structure and interact with phospholipids in the RBC membrane. In benzene dicarboxylic and tricarboxylic acids, a part of benzene nucleus between the two carboxylic groups is thought to enter the plasma membrane and act on acyl-chain in phospholipids in the RBC membrane.

However, no specific substrates or functions for Ehhadh are known, and Ehhadh knockout (KO) mice display no appreciable changes in lipid metabolism. To investigate Ehhadh functions, we used a bioinformatics approach and found that Ehhadh expression co-varies with genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and in mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation. Based on these findings and the regulation of Ehhadh's expression by PPAR alpha, we hypothesized that the phenotype of Ehhadh KO mice would become apparent after fasting.

PM 2. 5 samples were collected in two monitoring sites, representing urban and rural background sta-tions. The high acid concentrations {{can be explained by the}} large human emission sources in the urbanized region, combined with the stagnant atmospheric conditions during the cold seasons that accumulate the organic precursors and accelerate the secondary atmospheric reactions. The distribution profiles of the investigated markers suggest the dominant contributions of primary anthropogenic sources, such as traffic, domestic heating and biomass burning. These results are confirmed by comparison with additional emission tracers, such as anhydro-saccharides for biomass burning and fatty acids originated from different anthropogenic sources. In addition, some secondary constituents were detected in both sites, as produced by in situ photo-chemical reactions from both biogenic (e. g. pinonic acid) and anthropogenic precursors (e. g. phthalic and <b>adipic</b> <b>acids).</b> The impact of different sources from human activities was elucidated by investigating theweek pattern of carboxylic and fattyacid concentrations.
