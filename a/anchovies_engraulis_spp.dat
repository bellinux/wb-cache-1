40|$|The {{abundance}} {{and distribution of}} small pelagic fish in coastal upwelling systems fluctuate in response to environmental or biotic factors acting on larval stages. <b>Anchovies</b> (<b>Engraulis</b> <b>spp.)</b> have evolved flexible adaptive strategies to maximise recruitment in such environments. Spawning usually occurs throughout coastal and shelf regions, however {{the relative importance of}} inshore/offshore waters for spawning and the survival of eggs and larvae is poorly understood. The objectives of this study were to 1 -identify the locations, and season, of anchovy (Engraulis australis) spawning in South Australia; 2 -determine the oceanographic and biotic characteristics (e. g sea-surface temperature and chlorophyll a levels,) of gulf and shelf waters during the spawning season of this species, and 3 -determine the relative importance of gulf and shelf waters for anchovy spawning and larval recruitment. Ichthyoplankton and oceanographic surveys encompassing a total of 128, 700 km² were conducted and anchovies were captured at locations throughout this area. Anchovy eggs were found throughout gulf and shelf waters, with highest densities recorded in northern areas of Spencer Gulf and Gulf St Vincent where sea surface temperatures (SST) were 24 – 26 °C. Spawning appeared to peak between 0000 and 0100 hours. Otolith increment counts were used to age larval, juvenile and adult anchovies from both shelf and gulf waters. In the northern Spencer Gulf only smaller, young fish up to 1 year of age occurred, where there were eggs and young larvae (10 mm total length (TL) were mainly found with the largest larvae, > 15 mm TL, being collected from shelf waters near up-welling zones where SSTs were relatively low (< 20 °C) and levels of chlorophyll a (chl a) relatively high. The high levels of larval abundance in the upwelling zones may reflect higher levels of recruitment to later stages in these areas compared with the gulfs. Gonosomatic indices, together with egg and larval densities, indicated that the peak spawning season was from January to March. This coincided with the enhanced period of productivity in shelf waters due to up-welling events. However, these highly variable environments can be highly dispersive with resulting high egg and larval mortalities and are generally dominated by sardines (Sardinops spp.). In addition to the shelf population young fish are also present in the relatively stable gulf environment. This population may act as a reserve of anchovy in South Australia from which the population may expand under favourable conditions. When the population of dominant sardines (S. sagax) are reduced, it appears that the subordinate anchovies, represented by older age-classes, are able to utilise offshore environments which may then provide additional spawning and nursery areas for this species.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 12 Forage fish play a {{key role}} in marine {{ecosystems}} and fisheries worldwide. They are highly productive, and undergo dramatic fluctuations in productivity, which interact with fishing pressure and spatial dynamics to generate population variability. The mechanisms and demographic processes behind this variability are poorly understood, creating a challenge for fishery managers. In this dissertation, I address the implications of demographic diversity for forage fish ecology and management. I investigate demographic diversity in space (Chapter 1) in space and time (Chapter 2), and among different forage species (Chapters 3 and 4). In the first chapter, I demonstrate that spatial diversity in a largely unfished forage fish population (Puget Sound Pacific herring; Clupea pallasii) can generate portfolio effects, which stabilize their availability as prey. In the second chapter, I build a hierarchical model to address the potential processes behind these portfolio effects, distinguishing temporal variation in mortality from spatial differences, and demonstrating that adult mortality has led to age truncation and recruitment-dominated dynamics. In the third chapter, I develop an age-structured population model and use a management strategy evaluation framework to show that demographic diversity among forage fish species (specifically, for sardine, anchovy, and menhaden-like forage species) affects management outcomes and tradeoffs. In the final chapter, I use a time series approach to investigate asynchronous dynamics in sardine (Sardinops <b>spp.)</b> and <b>anchovy</b> (<b>Engraulis</b> <b>spp.),</b> and show that although these two species are often viewed as alternating members of the forage fish guild, sardine and anchovy alone do not compose a forage portfolio that buffers fisheries and food webs from dramatic shifts in productivity. These results demonstrate the rarity of asynchronous dynamics and the importance of considering, but not relying upon, demographic diversity in forage fish populations...|$|R

50|$|Recruitment of fish is {{regulated}} by larval fish survival. Survival {{is regulated}} by prey abundance, predation, and hydrology. Fish eggs and larvae are eaten by many marine organisms. For example, {{they may be}} fed upon by marine invertebrates, such as copepods, arrow worms, jellyfish, amphipods, marine snails and krill. Because they are so abundant, marine invertebrates inflict high overall mortality rates. Adult fish also prey on fish eggs and larvae. For example, haddock were observed satiating themselves with herring eggs back in 1922. Another study found cod in a herring spawning area with 20,000 herring eggs in their stomachs, and concluded that they could prey on half of the total egg production. Fish also cannibalise their own eggs. For example, separate studies found northern <b>anchovy</b> (<b>Engraulis</b> mordax) were responsible for 28% of the mortality in their own egg population, while Peruvian anchoveta were responsible for 10% and South African <b>anchovy</b> (<b>Engraulis</b> encrasicolus) 70%.|$|R
