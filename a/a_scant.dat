5|$|Lansford W. Hastings, {{an early}} {{immigrant}} from Ohio to the West, went to California in 1842 {{and saw the}} promise of the undeveloped country. To encourage settlers, he published The Emigrants' Guide to Oregon and California. He described a direct route across the Great Basin which would bring immigrants through the Wasatch Mountains and across the Great Salt Lake Desert. Hastings had not traveled any part of his proposed shortcut until early 1846 on a trip from California to Fort Bridger. The fort was <b>a</b> <b>scant</b> supply station run by Jim Bridger and his partner Pierre Louis Vasquez in Blacks Fork, Wyoming. Hastings stayed at the fort to persuade travelers to turn south on his route. As of 1846, Hastings was the second of two men documented to have crossed {{the southern part of the}} Great Salt Lake Desert, but neither had been accompanied by wagons.|$|E

25|$|The Roman {{sources on}} Germanic chants are {{not based on}} ethnographical topica, but {{originate}} from actual experiences. The primary attributes of Germanic singing {{can be derived from}} the accounts on the Germanic tribes by Publius Cornelius Tacitus. <b>As</b> <b>scant</b> and recapitulary Tacitus' observations might be, it is possible to deduce two discrete music genres: the war chant (barditus/barritus/baritus), and the heroic songs.|$|R

50|$|Claudius Hieronymianus {{is named}} in only <b>a</b> few <b>scant</b> references. The {{dedication}} stone at Eboracum (present-day York) naming Hieronymianus is dated to some point between AD190 and AD212, {{when he was}} acting as Legate of the 6th Legion then garrisoned at Eboracum. By AD 212 he was acting as Governor of Cappadocia.|$|R
25|$|Some {{believe that}} a primary reason for the Henderson & Co {{transaction}} with the Cherokee was that the northernmost Cherokee towns were <b>a</b> <b>scant</b> 50 or so miles from the Cumberland Gap and commanded {{the route of the}} Wilderness Road.

25|$|Microscopically, {{there are}} four {{architectural}} and cytological types (patterns) of hepatocellular carcinoma: fibrolamellar, pseudoglandular (adenoid), pleomorphic (giant cell) and clear cell. In well-differentiated forms, tumor cells resemble hepatocytes, form trabeculae, cords, and nests, and may contain bile pigment in the cytoplasm. In poorly differentiated forms, malignant epithelial cells are discohesive, pleomorphic, anaplastic, giant. The tumor has <b>a</b> <b>scant</b> stroma and central necrosis because of the poor vascularization.|$|E

25|$|In Uruguay, {{the first}} {{dedicated}} studies {{show it to}} be not uncommon but patchily distributed {{across the country in}} winter. Notably, it had been underreported in Flores and Paysandú Departments, where it seems in fact to be a regular visitor. In recent years, the first birds were seen in early November, and some stayed until late February. Numbers increase throughout November and peak in December, when flocks of many dozen roam the open lands. But many stay only for <b>a</b> <b>scant</b> few weeks before leaving again.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} year, Italian {{astronomer}} Giuseppe Piazzi discovered the dwarf planet Ceres. Piazzi could only track Ceres for somewhat {{more than a}} month, following it for three degrees across the night sky. Then it disappeared temporarily behind {{the glare of the}} Sun. Several months later, when Ceres should have reappeared, Piazzi could not locate it: the mathematical tools of the time were not able to extrapolate a position from such <b>a</b> <b>scant</b> amount of data—three degrees represent less than 1% of the total orbit.|$|E
25|$|What is {{now known}} as the Inland Empire was {{inhabited}} for thousands of years, prior to the late eighteenth century, by the Tongva, Serrano, and Cahuilla Native Americans. With Spanish colonization and the subsequent Mexican era the area was sparsely populated at the land grant Ranchos, considering it unsuitable for missions. The first American settlers, a group of Mormon pioneers, arrived over the Cajon Pass in 1851. Although the Mormons left <b>a</b> <b>scant</b> six years later, recalled to Salt Lake City by Brigham Young during the church's Utah War with the US government, other settlers soon followed.|$|E

50|$|By chance, Wilkinson met Msgr. Thomas O'Dwyer, the Archdiocesan Director of Catholic Charities, who {{introduced}} him to slums <b>a</b> few <b>scant</b> miles {{from his home in}} Beverly Hills, and recruited him to the Citizens Housing Council, and advocacy group for slum clearance and public housing. From this, it was a logical progression to the staff of the Los Angeles Housing Authority.|$|R
5000|$|The Spotlight {{has always}} been a local news source. Reviewing early copies doesn’t give a true picture of the {{changing}} larger world. John F. Kennedy’s 1963 assassination received <b>a</b> heartfelt, but <b>scant</b> four-inch editorial.|$|R
25|$|Argentina {{is home to}} a {{significant}} population of Arab and partial Arab background, mostly of Syrian and Lebanese origin (in Argentina they are considered among the white people, just like in the United States Census), The majority of Arab Argentines are Christians who belong to the Maronite Church, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Rite Catholic Churches. <b>A</b> <b>scant</b> number are Muslims of Middle Eastern origins. The Asian population in the country numbers at around 180,000 individuals, most of whom are of Chinese and Korean descent, although an older Japanese community that traces back to the early 20th century still exists.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the final race of the season, the Los Angeles Times 500, at Ontario Motor Speedway, Ontario, California, Waltrip led Richard Petty by <b>a</b> <b>scant</b> 2 points in the year-long {{championship}} battle after finishing the race 5th ahead of Petty's 6th-place finish in the previous race, the Dixie 500, Atlanta Motor Speedway, November 4, 1979. However, Petty won an unprecedented seventh, and his final, NASCAR Winston Cup Championship by finishing the final race of the season in 5th position, as Waltrip finished 8th. The final margin of Petty's Championship victory over Waltrip was only 11 points, the third-closest points race in NASCAR Winston Cup history.|$|E
25|$|Moses called {{heaven and}} earth to witness against the Israelites that should they make for {{themselves}} a sculptured image {{when they were in}} the land, then God would scatter them among the peoples, leaving only <b>a</b> <b>scant</b> few alive. There in exile they would serve man-made gods of wood and stone, that {{would not be able to}} see, hear, eat, or smell. But when they were in distress and they searched for God with all their heart and soul, returned to God, and obeyed God, then they would find God, even there. For God is a compassionate God, Who would not fail them, let them perish, or forget the covenant that God made with their fathers.|$|E
40|$|Naturally acidified marine {{ecosystems}} are currently investigated {{to evaluate the}} effects of ocean acidification on species, communities and ecological processes. Among these, submarine shallow CO₂ vents represent a sort of natural mesocosms, where at small spatial scales marked gradient of pH are present. The aim of this project is to study the responses of fish assemblages to pH reduction in Mediterranean shallow CO₂ vents by using several descriptors such as community structure, trophic organization, chemical characteristics and composition of carbonic structures. Moreover as in CO₂ vents concentration and bio-availability of several trace elements, also toxic ones, may increase due to direct input from the vents and/or to peculiar pH and Eh conditions, another aim is the evaluation of trace element bioaccumulation and biomagnification. <b>As</b> <b>scant</b> information {{is available in the}} literature on this topic, the results of this research will contribute to bridge the gap to predict the ecological effects of ocean acidification on fishes, a key biological component whose monitoring is relevant not only from the ecological standpoint but also for the economic one and for the implications on human health...|$|R

And then the stillness of the Armistice took hold.|$|R
25|$|Shmuelevitz {{married the}} rosh yeshiva's {{daughter}} {{on the last}} day of Hanukkah 5690 (3 January 1930). <b>A</b> <b>scant</b> few years later, at the relatively young age of 31, Shmuelevitz was appointed as a maggid shiur, delivering regular lectures. Rabbi Shmuelevitz's lectures were modeled on the study strategy of his erstwhile mentor, Rabbi Shimon Shkop, personalized in a style of his own. The hallmark of his lectures was depth combined with a fabulous breadth; it was not uncommon for him to cite 20 or 30 different sources from far-flung corners of the Talmud and its commentaries during a single shiur. These shiurim attracted a wide audience, including some of the most advanced students in Mir.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} {{adoption}} of the Broad Breasted White by industrial producers, other turkey varieties faded in numbers. Other than exhibition birds and those on <b>a</b> <b>scant</b> few small farms, other turkeys virtually disappeared. By the end of the 20th century, all but the Broad Breasted White were in danger of extinction. Around this time, conservation organizations began to recognize the plight of heritage turkeys; The Livestock Conservancy considered heritage turkeys to be the most critically endangered of all domestic animals circa 1997. A census conducted by the Conservancy found less than 1,500 total breeding birds (out of all heritage varieties) were left in the country. Some breeds, such as the Narragansett, had less than a dozen individuals left, and many considered most heritage turkeys to be beyond hope.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the command}} of Thiệu, the siege of the barracks started, and rebel {{artillery}} shells soon reduced the buildings to rubble, but the pro-Diệm loyalists fought on, <b>a</b> <b>scant</b> five blocks from the palace. Presidential Guard tanks returned fire, severely damaging nearby roadways. After an hour, Diệm and Nhu suspected that something was amiss and attempted to call Đính's office {{for a second time}} and again were told Đính was not there. Not believing Đính had double-crossed them, the Ngô brothers were heard in the background speculating that Đính had been arrested by the rebels. The generals then phoned Gia Long Palace with an ultimatum. If Diệm resigned immediately, he and Nhu would be safely exiled. If he did not, they would launch air strikes and start shelling the palace within the hour. The generals said {{that there would be no}} negotiation, only a yes or no would be acceptable. Diệm made no reply.|$|E
50|$|Befitting {{the single}} {{historical}} {{mention of the}} Novantae by Ptolemy, many historians have largely included the Novantae im passim in their works, if they are mentioned at all. William Forbes Skene (Celtic Scotland, 1886) briefly relates their notice in Ptolemy, adding his conjectures as to the possible locations of towns, though not with any conviction. John Rhys (Celtic Britain, 1904) mentions the Novantae in passing, without any detailed discussion. Local Galwegian historians, writing histories of their own home territory, provide <b>a</b> similarly <b>scant</b> treatment.|$|R
50|$|Service 40: Aberystwyth to Carmarthen (replacement for X40). Compared to the X40, {{early morning}} {{northbound}} journeys were cut drastically on Saturdays, {{with the first}} bus from Carmarthen not reaching Aberystwyth until 11:15. An improvement however was the introduction of <b>a</b> (very <b>scant)</b> Sunday service of two trips each way. The initial timetable also promised that the journey time would be cut drastically. However, the service {{was not able to}} reliably keep to the timetable and the timings were later aľŁdjusted to be more realistic.|$|R
50|$|Coupled {{with the}} {{financial}} hardships on each man's end, the trio hatch a plan to rob a safe at union headquarters. They commit the caper but find only <b>a</b> few <b>scant</b> bills in the process. More importantly, they also come away with a ledger which contains evidence of the union's illegal loan operation and ties to organized crime syndicates. They attempt to blackmail the union with the information but the union retaliates strongly and begins to turn the tables on the three friends. A suspicious accident at the plant results in Smokey's death.|$|R
