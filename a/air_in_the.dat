5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} is {{an abnormal}} collection of <b>air</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pleural {{space between the}} lung and the chest wall. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp, one-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. In a minority of cases the amount of <b>air</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chest increases when a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, leading to a tension pneumothorax. This condition can cause a steadily worsening oxygen shortage and low blood pressure. Unless reversed by effective treatment, it can result in death. Very rarely both lungs may be affected by a pneumothorax. It is often called a collapsed lung, although that term may also refer to atelectasis.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, a Nazi {{task force}} assaults the Natural History Museum in London, {{which has been}} overrun by monsters.

This episode was written by Mark Gatiss and planned to <b>air</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fourth series of Doctor Who, but was replaced by The Fires of Pompeii. Elements of the story were later reused in Steven Moffat's The Big Bang, the finale of Series 5.|$|E

5|$|November is {{traditionally}} {{the start of}} the thunderstorm season along the eastern seaboard of Australia, with a rise in average humidity and warmer ground temperatures combining with more frequent occurrences of cool <b>air</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper atmosphere. These conditions are conducive for producing severe thunderstorms, particularly those which feature hail.|$|E
5|$|October 21, 1950– The {{threat of}} Hurricane Love results in {{hurricane}} evacuations {{along the western}} coastline, though dry <b>air</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> storm leads to very little effects after it hits {{near the mouth of}} the Steinhatchee River.|$|E
5|$|Several {{options were}} {{implemented}} {{to increase the}} bridge's lifespan. These included a dehumidification programme that slowed the rate of corrosion in the main cables by keeping <b>air</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> voids between the main cables' strands below 40% humidity. Engineering consultants Faber Maunsell began work on the project in 2006, which took {{two and a half}} years to complete at a cost of £7.8million. As part of the works, some of the corroded cable strands were spliced.|$|E

5|$|The {{new series}} {{was offered a}} place {{on a number of}} {{television}} networks, with CTV and CBC (the franchise's former network) vying as the top contenders. CTV won through, offering $10million for a fifteen-episode season. The project was greenlit in May 2000, with the originally planned reunion episode serving as the pilot to the new series. CTV announced the new series at its annual press conference in June 2001, and said the pilot would <b>air</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fall.|$|E
5|$|Though Boston College {{lost the}} game on the scoreboard, it won almost every {{statistical}} category. Quarterback Matt Ryan outperformed both Hokie quarterbacks combined in passing yardage, throwing for 305yards. Ryan was extremely accurate through the <b>air</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fourth quarter, throwing eight straight complete passes, an ACC Championship Game record. Ryan also was surprisingly successful on the ground, rushing for Boston College's touchdown of the gamea 14-yard sprint {{in the second quarter}} that put Boston College ahead 167.|$|E
5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} (collapsed lung) is {{an abnormal}} collection of <b>air</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pleural space that causes an uncoupling of the lung from the chest wall. The lung cannot expand against the air pressure inside the pleural space. An {{easy to understand}} example is a traumatic pneumothorax, where air enters the pleural space from outside the body, as occurs with puncture to the chest wall. Similarly, a scuba diver ascending while holding their breath with their lungs fully inflated can cause air sacs (alveoli) to burst and leak high pressure air into the pleural space.|$|E

5|$|A strong {{tropical}} wave accompanied with a {{low pressure}} system moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on August 19. It moved quickly westward and organized, developing banding features and cirrus outflow near the blossoming convection. The wave nearly developed into a tropical cyclone on August 21, though its fast forward motion dislocated the low level circulation from the deep convection. The wave entered an area of dry <b>air</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> central Atlantic Ocean, and by late on August 22 most of the convection dissipated from the system. On August 24, convection increased as the wave passed through the Lesser Antilles, though strong southwesterly upper level wind shear prevented further development. The tropical wave moved through the Caribbean Sea, and developed deep convection due to more favorable conditions over the Gulf of Honduras on August 28. The wave crossed the Yucatán Peninsula, and developed a surface low pressure area on the 29th in the Gulf of Mexico. Convection continued to organize, and the tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Eleven on August 30 while located 335miles (540km) east-southeast of Corpus Christi, Texas.|$|E
5|$|As the mesocyclone lowers {{below the}} cloud base, {{it begins to}} take in cool, moist air from the {{downdraft}} region of the storm. The convergence of warm <b>air</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> updraft and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it creates an {{area of low pressure}} at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, {{in the form of a}} visible condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, fanning outward and creating a gust front that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.|$|E
5|$|At 07:20 Moscow time on 19 November, Soviet {{forces on}} the {{northern}} flank of the Axis forces at Stalingrad began their offensive; forces in the south began on 20 November. Although Romanian units were able to repel the first attacks, {{by the end of}} 20 November the Third and Fourth Romanian armies were in headlong retreat, as the Red Army bypassed several German infantry divisions. German mobile reserves were not strong enough to parry the Soviet mechanized spearheads, while the Sixth Army did not react quickly enough nor decisively enough to disengage German armored forces in Stalingrad and reorient them to defeat the impending threat. By late 22 November Soviet forces linked up at the town of Kalach, encircling some 290,000 men east of the Don River. Instead of attempting {{to break out of the}} encirclement, German leader Adolf Hitler decided to keep Axis forces in Stalingrad and resupply them by <b>air.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> meantime, Soviet and German commanders began to plan their next movements.|$|E

5|$|At the 500hPa level, the air {{temperature}} averages −7°C (18°F) within the tropics, but <b>air</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tropics is normally dry at this level, giving the air room to wet-bulb, or cool as it moistens, {{to a more}} favorable temperature that can then support convection. A wetbulb temperature at 500hPa in a tropical atmosphere of −13.2°C is required to initiate convection if the water temperature is 26.5°C, and this temperature requirement increases or decreases proportionally by 1°C in the sea surface temperature for each 1°C change at 500hpa.|$|E
5|$|Benn {{was born}} in London on 3 April 1925. He had two brothers, Michael, who was older, and David, a {{specialist}} in Russia and Eastern Europe. Their father, William Wedgwood Benn, was a Liberal Member of Parliament from 1906 who crossed the floor to the Labour Party in 1928 and was appointed Secretary of State for India by Ramsay MacDonald in 1929, a position he held until the Labour Party's landslide electoral defeat in 1931. William Benn was elevated to the House of Lords with the title of Viscount Stansgate in 1942 – the new wartime coalition government was short of working Labour peers in the upper house. In 1945–46, William Benn was the Secretary of State for <b>Air</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first majority Labour Government.|$|E

Thus, in the 1920s and 1930s, while aviators and aircraft makers {{in the rest of}} the world were working to improve the performance of powered aircraft, the Germans were designing, developing and flying ever more efficient gliders and discovering ways of using the natural forces in the atmosphere to make them fly farther and faster.
