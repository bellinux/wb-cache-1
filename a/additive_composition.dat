Fifteen 6 - 7 year old children solved pairs of conceptually-related addition problems.

The findings indicate that, when prompted, children who employ only basic calculation procedures have the capability to recognise and use <b>additive</b> <b>composition</b> relations in problem solving. Almost all children showed increased sensitivity to <b>additive</b> <b>composition</b> relations when asked to explain the equality between related problems.

40|$|<b>Additive</b> <b>composition</b> (Foltz et al, 1998; Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Mitchell and Lapata, 2010) is {{a widely}} used method for {{computing}} meanings of phrases, which takes the average of vector representations of the constituent words. In this article, we prove an upper bound for the bias of <b>additive</b> <b>composition,</b> {{which is the first}} theoretical analysis on compositional frameworks from a machine learning point of view. The bound is written in terms of collocation strength; we prove that the more exclusively two successive words tend to occur together, the more accurate one can guarantee their <b>additive</b> <b>composition</b> as an approximation to the natural phrase vector. Our proof relies on properties of natural language data that are empirically verified, and can be theoretically derived from an assumption that the data is generated from a Hierarchical Pitman-Yor Process. The theory endorses <b>additive</b> <b>composition</b> as a reasonable operation for calculating meanings of phrases, and suggests ways to improve additive compositionality, including: transforming entries of distributional word vectors by a function that meets a specific condition, constructing a novel type of vector representations to make <b>additive</b> <b>composition</b> sensitive to word order, and utilizing singular value decomposition to train word vectors.

We can show that certain <b>additive</b> <b>compositions</b> within the encapsulation and back sheet foils are critical for the formation of the discolouring silver nanoparticles.

The cases of electrodeposition by additives in the electrolytic solution and by pulse plating were investigated. The mathematical model includes ¯uid ¯ow, transport by di usion, migration and convection, multiple species, reactions, moving boundaries and three-dimensional capabilities. For electrodeposition by additives the chemistry mechanism {{was based on}} additive competition for free sites on the active surface, thus suppressing copper kinetics. In pulse plating, transient behaviour was simulated with time. Two numerical codes, ERMES and FIDIPIDDIS, based on ®nite di erence for general curvilinear coordinates, were developed.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{findings from}} a project which aimed at exploring low attaining children’s sensitivity to problem relationships based on <b>additive</b> <b>composition</b> and possible variations in children’s understanding and capability {{to use such}} relations in problem solving. Fifteen 6 - 7 year-old children solved conceptually related and unrelated addition problems in individual sessions. All problems involved single-digit additions up to 20 {{with two or three}} addends ranging between 1 and 9. Conceptual relations between problems were constructed to reflect aspects of the principle of <b>additive</b> <b>composition.</b> Children’s understanding of <b>additive</b> <b>composition</b> relations was explored by analysing children’s strategy use and explanations of the equality between conceptually related problems. The findings indicate high within-group variation in children’s capability to recognise and use numerical relations between problems. Children who used mainly basic calculation procedures were able to explain retrospectively why two problems had the same answer by recognising the numerical, part-whole relations between problems. Prompting children to use a previously solved problem did not have a considerable effect in children’s noticing of the numerical relations but the requirement to explain the problem equality evoked greater sensitivity to <b>additive</b> <b>composition</b> relations. The findings highlight the need for pedagogical approaches that enable low attaining children to operationalise their capabilities into their learning. <br/...|$|E

Scholars were at the time uncovering the remnants of Pompeii, and discovering the use of bright colour in Roman architecture – an aspect that had more or less been forgotten in the Renaissance, but also rediscovering Greece and Egypt. These aspects were incorporated into Neoclassicism and continued into Nordic Classicism (e.g. The Thorvaldsen Museum, Copenhagen, 1839–48, by M.G.

Stasiak and colleagues devised a constructive method for a knot "energy" using a Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm {{to minimize the}} length of rope needed to realize a given knot for a rope of a fixed diameter. They called the resulting rendering of the knot the "ideal" configuration. They have found (i) that the 3 -dimensional (3 D) writhe of the ideal configuration of a knot appeared, empirically, to be quantized; (ii) empirically, the 3 D writhe of the ideal configuration was <b>additive</b> over <b>composition</b> of knots; and (iii) the 3 D writhe of ideal configuration of alternating knots (which have a projection in which crossings alternate between over and under as one transverses the knot in a fixed direction) seems to be equal, to 1 *T + 3 / 7 *(W-B), where T is the "Tait number," and W and B are {{the number of the}} white and black regions in the checkerboard coloring of the knot. It is still not clear why properties i-iii might be true. Here I show that all these empirical findings can be related to the fact that T and W-B can be proven to be <b>additive</b> over <b>composition</b> of alternating knots. In particular, (1) the 3 D writhe of ideal configurations is likely only to be <b>additive</b> for <b>composition</b> of alternating knots, and (2) remarkably, the geometrical structure of all alternating (even prime) knots is determined by the three smallest knots...|$|R

40|$|A paraffin/water-dispersion is a {{pumpable}} {{latent heat}} storage medium. Latent heat storage mediums store energy by using the heat of crystallization during the phase transition from liquid to solid.

The aim of this work is to define the flow characteristics of paraffin/water-dispersions and {{to figure out the}} relationship between the sort of paraffin, paraffin concentration and <b>additive</b> <b>compositions.</b> The measurements for that analysis are done with a rheometer. The measurement results reveal that paraffin/water-dispersions show shear thinning behavior with a strong viscosity drop in a span of low shear rates. With an increasing paraffin and additive concentration the viscosity raises. For describing the flow properties, the mathematical relationship of the Ostwald- de Waele power law is used.

During this aberration viscosity is increasing and the nonlinear properties of the dispersion are enhancing...|$|R

Isothermal dilatometric measurements show that the activation energy ΔE of the shrinkage of the coated powders is lower than that of the powders prepared by milling. This is caused by the homogeneous distribution of the additive. The activation energy for the different additives changes in the following sequence: ΔE(2 BaO/TiO 2 / 2 SiO 2) < ΔE(TiO 2) < ΔE(CaO/TiO 2 /SiO 2) < ΔE(TiO 2 /SiO 2).

While convexity and monotonicity extend in straightforward manner from the single-period case, {{the role of}} information is more problematic in the multi-period situation. In this paper, we define multi-period functionals {{in such a way}} that the development of available information over time (expressed as a filtration) enters explicitly the definition of the functional. This allows to define and study the property of information monotonicity, i. e. monotonicity w. r. t. increasing filtrations. On the other hand, time consistency of valuations is a favorable property and it is well-known that this requirement essentially leads to compositions of conditional mappings. We demonstrate that generally spoken the intersection of time consistent and information monotone valuation functionals is rather sparse, although both classes alone are quite rich. In particular, the paper gives a necessary and sufficient condition for information monotonicity of <b>additive</b> <b>compositions</b> of positively homogeneous risk/acceptability mappings.
