Recent experimental evidence implicated the lysophospholipase, autotaxin (ATX), and its product, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), as potential mediators of cholestatic pruritus. In this study, we highlight that increased serum ATX levels are specific for pruritus of cholestasis, but not pruritus of uremia, Hodgkin's disease, or <b>atopic</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> <b>Treatment</b> {{of patients with}} cholestasis with the bile salt sequestrant, colesevelam, but not placebo, effectively reduced total serum bile salts and fibroblast growth factor 19 levels, but only marginally altered pruritus intensity and ATX activity. Rifampicin (RMP) significantly reduced itch intensity and ATX activity in patients with pruritus not responding to bile salt sequestrants. In vitro, RMP inhibited ATX expression in human HepG 2 hepatoma cells and hepatoma cells overexpressing the pregnane X receptor (PXR), but not in hepatoma cells in which PXR was knocked down. Treatment of severe, refractory pruritus by the molecular adsorbents recirculation system or nasobiliary drainage improved itch intensity, which, again, correlated with the reduction of ATX levels. Upon reoccurrence of pruritus, ATX activity returned to pretreatment values. Conclusion: Serum ATX activity is specifically increased in patients with cholestatic, but not other forms of, systemic pruritus and closely correlates with the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. The beneficial antipruritic action of RMP may be explained, at least partly, by the PXR-dependent transcriptional inhibition of ATX expression.

The patients were randomized, to receive either complex conventional treatment, or conventional treatment plus melatonin at a daily dose of 3 mg, being administered at 9 P. M. Primary endpoint of the study: Severity scoring using SCORAD index. Assessment of pharmacological effects included counting functional evaluation of T-cells, B-cells and phagocytes, as well as morning and evening serum levels of IgE, IL- 4 and IFN-γ. Results. In melatonin group, a statistically significant SCORAD index reduction was revealed, as compared with conventionally treated group (84 % vs 60 %). Addition of melatonin to conventional treatment caused a 63 per cent decrease in relative risks of unfavorable outcome, defined as absence of 20 per cent improvement by the SCORAD scale. Clinical improvement in melatonin group was associated with increase in CD 8 +cell counts, IgM levels and indices of Fc-dependent monocyte and neutrophil phagocytosis.

30|$|Due to {{atmospheric}} pollution {{and changes in}} residential environments resulting from the rapid industrialization of modern society, {{the number of patients}} with atopic dermatitis has been recently increasing. Atopic dermatitis is a skin disease that may occur in any age group that is characterized by severe itch resulting from chronic inflammatory eczema. Genetic factors are strongly related to this disease, and stress, changes in external environments, and infection are major causes of atopic dermatitis aggravation. A major symptom of atopic dermatitis is severe itch, and this disease induces abrasions, erythematous eruption, blisters, and various lesions (Shultz and Hanifin 2002). Because the cause of the symptoms for atopic dermatitis has not been clearly established (Bos et al. 1992), studies of the cause have been unceasingly conducted. Although the management of environmental conditions that may be problematic and drug treatment centering on steroids and antihistamines are used as major treatment methods (Park et al. 2002), the symptoms of this disease are only temporarily relieved, and the aggravation and relief of symptoms are repeated. In addition, adverse affects to some external application products are emerging. Therefore, recent studies have mainly been conducted using products for external application containing oriental medicinal extracts with natural materials that enhance moisturizing effects as therapeutic agents for atopic dermatitis (Hong and Jung 2014). Although clinical effects from extracts from various natural products used as <b>atopic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> <b>treatment</b> materials have been demonstrated, no clear solution has been presented until now. Therefore, among the microorganisms that may be easily produced due to their ability to be cultured in large numbers, we aimed to identify the effects of the photosynthetic bacteria Rhodobacter sphaeroides on atopic dermatitis.|$|E
40|$|Rosanna MarsellaDepartment of Small Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida Gainesville, FL, USAAbstract: Remarkable {{progress}} has been made in recent years concerning our understanding of the pathogenesis of canine atopic dermatitis (AD). As our understanding improves, the therapeutic approach evolves. Of utmost importance is the documentation of skin barrier impairment in canine AD: ceramides deficiency leads to increased permeability and increased allergen penetration and sensitization. It is currently unknown whether this dysfunction is primary and genetically inherited or secondary to inflammation but it is accepted that skin barrier deficiency plays an important role in either starting or minimally exacerbating canine AD. Thus, the therapeutic approach has changed from focusing on the control of the inflammation to a combined approach that includes therapies aimed at skin barrier repair. The issue of skin barrier repair has been addressed both with oral administration of essential fatty acids and the topical application of products containing a combination of ceramides and fatty acids. These strategies are most helpful as adjunctive treatments and would be best used in young patients that have not developed chronic skin changes. Importantly, treatment for canine AD is multimodal and tailored to the individual patient, the age, and the duration of the disease. Client education plays an important role in explaining the importance of a long-term approach to minimize flare-ups and, in this context, topical therapy to correct skin barrier can be of great benefit. This is an area still in infancy and much work is needed to identify the best formulation. In human medicine, long-term use of moisturizers can have a profound effect on skin barrier and gene expression of proteins involved in skin barrier. This effect is variable depending on the formulation used. It is reasonable to speculate that the same may be true in dogs; thus, it is very important to identify the correct ingredients and formulation to use.

40|$|We {{assessed}} completeness {{of trial}} registration {{and the extent}} of outcome-reporting bias in published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of eczema (<b>atopic</b> <b>dermatitis)</b> <b>treatments</b> by surveying all relevant RCTs published from January 2007 to July 2011 located in a database called the Global Resource of Eczema Trials (GREAT). The GREAT database is compiled by searching six bibliographic databases, including EMBASE and MEDLINE. Out of 109 identified RCTs, only 37 (34 %) had been registered on an approved trial register. Only 18 out of 109 trials (17 %) had been registered “properly” in terms of submitting the registration before the trial end date and nominating a primary outcome. The proportion of “any registered” and “properly registered” RCTs increased from 19 % and 10 % in 2007 to 57 % and 36 % in 2011, respectively. Assessment of selective outcome-reporting bias was difficult even among the properly registered trials owing to unclear primary outcome description especially with regard to timing. Only 5 out of the 109 trials (5 %) provided enough information for us to be confident that the outcomes reported in the published trial were consistent with the original registration. Adequate trial registration and description of primary outcomes for eczema RCTs is currently poor...|$|R
40|$|<b>Atopic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> (AtD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} types of allergic lesions of skin in children. Increase of severe types of AtD with lesion of big parts of skin, high frequency of exacerbations, presence of concomitant atopic diseases, and inefficiency of standard therapeutic approaches, torpid clinical course and early development of disability, causes an anxiety. Present standard approaches can be ineffective in children with severe clinical course of AtD and they are not able to prevent progression of disease, development of severe exacerbations and child’s disability. One of therapeutic alternatives for these patients is treatment with immunosuppressive agents. The article describes questions of treatment with cyclosporine in systemic therapy of severe resistant forms of AtD in children. Author discusses effectiveness and safety of a drug, formulated rules of treatment of severe AtD with cyclosporine.

40|$|In a {{subgroup}} of patients suffering from <b>atopic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> (AD), <b>treatment</b> is quite difficult even after taking oral immunosuppressants. High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment {{has been reported}} to be beneficial for them in a few uncontrolled trials. Herein we report a case of intractable AD in a 5 -year-old girl who had significant clinical improvement after receiving 3 cycles of IVIG treatment (2 g/kg) without notable side effects. Since the first infusion of IVIG, the patient’s skin lesions improved steadily and the improvement persisted until the 8 -month follow-up. The eczema area and severity index score decreased remarkably, while immunologic parameters did not correlate with clinical improvement. This case suggests that IVIG therapy can be quite effective and safe for children wit...|$|R
