Teachers gather at the Folger for day-long and month-long programs to work to incorporate Shakespeare and performance in the classroom. The department also publishes a variety of materials for classroom use. Student programs include workshops, local residency initiatives, and a high school fellowship program during which students study Shakespeare at the Folger. The Emily Jordan Folger Children's Shakespeare Festival, founded in 1980, allows elementary students to perform every spring. The Secondary School Shakespeare Festival, founded the following year, brings students from grades 7–12 to perform half-hour collections of Shakespeare scenes in the Folger theater.|$|E

40|$|Identifying the {{appropriate}} kernel function/matrix {{for a given}} dataset is essential to all kernel-based learning techniques. A number of kernel learning algorithms have been proposed to learn kernel functions or matrices from side information (e. g., either labeled examples or pairwise constraints). However, most previous studies are limited to “passive” kernel learning in which side information is provided beforehand. In this paper we present a framework of <b>Active</b> Kernel <b>Learning</b> (AKL) that actively identifies the most informative pairwise constraints for kernel learning. The key challenge of <b>active</b> kernel <b>learning</b> is how to measure the informativeness of an example pair given its class label is unknown. To this end, we propose a min-max approach for <b>active</b> kernel <b>learning</b> that selects the example pair that results in a large classification margin regardless of its assigned class label. We furthermore approximate the related optimization problem into a convex programming problem. We {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} the proposed algorithm by comparing it to two other implementations of <b>active</b> kernel <b>learning.</b> Empirical study with nine datasets on semi-supervised data clustering shows that the proposed algorithm is more effective than its competitors...|$|R

2500|$|The {{purpose of}} {{language}} attrition, in general, is to discover how, why {{and what is}} lost when a language is forgotten. The aim in foreign or second-language attrition research {{is to find out}} why, after an <b>active</b> <b>learning</b> process, the language competence changes or even stops (Gleason 1982). Further, results from research in this area could, as Van Els and Weltens (1989) counter, contribute to the understanding of relations between acquisition and attrition (van Els 1989). L2/FL attrition research is particularly important because it provides interesting results for foreign language instruction. De Bot and Weltens state, [...] "esearch on language attrition can also have a considerable impact on curriculum planning or foreign language teaching" [...] (1995: 152). The theoretical grounding of the language attrition research derives primarily from cognitive and psychological theories. Research in the area of language attrition concentrates generally on the loss of the L1 and L2. The first distinction that can be made is between pathological and natural language attrition. The former concentrates on language loss caused by a damage of the brain, injury, age or illness. However, this topic will not be investigated any further, because the language attrition in these cases is not caused by natural circumstances. Weltens (1987: 24) states another possible distinction, inter and intra generational language attrition. Inter generational language attrition is concerned with attrition within individuals, whereas intra generational language attrition concentrates on the attrition across different generations. Van Els (1986) distinguishes types of attrition in terms of which language is lost and in which environment it is being lost. Therefore, he classifies: ...|$|E
