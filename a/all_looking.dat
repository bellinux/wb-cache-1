25|$|On Stage 15 Schleck was race {{leader and}} {{pressing}} the pace over the day's final climb of Port de Bales when {{he threw his}} chain. Contador and Denis Menchov immediately moved {{to the front and}} attacked, pressing the advantage over the crest of the climb and all the way back down into Bagneres-de-Luchon. They were aided by Sammy Sanchez and two others making a group of five riders, <b>all</b> <b>looking</b> to gain time. Schleck chased hard, but had no other riders to help bridge the gap. By stage's end, he had lost the yellow jersey and 39 seconds to Contador. Contador, who now had an eight-second lead in the race, met with a mixed reception as he received the yellow jersey on the podium {{at the end of the}} stage.|$|E
25|$|Gately's bandmates flew to Majorca on 11 October 2009; Walsh was {{expected}} to join them soon after. The remaining members of Boyzone, Keith Duffy, Michael Graham, Ronan Keating and Shane Lynch, issued a joint statement: We are completely devastated {{by the loss of}} our friend and brother, Stephen. We have shared such wonderful times together over the years and were <b>all</b> <b>looking</b> forward to sharing many more. Stephen was a beautiful person in both body and spirit. He lit up our lives and those of the many friends he had all over the world. Our love and sympathy go out to Andrew and Stephen's family. We love you and will miss you forever, 'Steo'.A post-mortem and toxicology tests took place on 13 October and this examination showed that Gately died of natural causes. He {{died as a result of}} a congenital heart defect. Toxicology also confirmed the statement by Gately's partner Cowles that he had been smoking cannabis that evening.|$|E
500|$|Perfectionist is {{a concept}} album which focusses on how perfectionism {{influences}} Kills. [...] "All the songs revolve around my ambition, celebrations, frustration and disappointments of being a perfectionist", she stated. [...] "I think we're all perfectionists – we're <b>all</b> <b>looking</b> for the best to fulfil our ideologies and dreams." [...] Kills was also inspired by [...] "women's obsession" [...] with fashion in general. She described the album's sound as [...] "dark pop" [...] due to its [...] "opinionated" [...] and [...] "confrontational" [...] lyrics which, according to her, differ from mainstream music. The lyrical content is occasionally comical and uses metaphors frequently.|$|E

500|$|In October 2004, Brosnan said he {{considered}} himself dismissed from the role. Although Brosnan had been rumoured frequently as {{still in the}} running to play 007, he had denied it several times, and in February 2005 he posted on his website that he was finished with the role. Daniel Craig took over the role on 14 October 2005. In an interview with The Globe and Mail, Brosnan was asked {{what he thought of}} Daniel Craig as the new James Bond. He replied, [...] "I'm looking forward to it like we're <b>all</b> <b>looking</b> forward to it. Daniel Craig is a great actor and he's going to do a fantastic job". He reaffirmed this support in an interview to the International Herald Tribune, stating that [...] " [...] on his way to becoming a memorable Bond." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the record's darker themes, many {{lyrics are}} more flippant and sexual {{than those from}} the band's {{previous}} work. This reflects the group's revisiting some of the Dadaist characters and stage antics they dabbled with in the late 1970s as teenagers but abandoned for more literal themes in the 1980s. While the band had previously been opposed to materialism, they examined and flirted with this value on the album and the Zoo TV Tour. The title and lyrics of [...] "Even Better Than the Real Thing" [...] are [...] "reflective of the times [...] were living in, when people were no longer looking for the truth, [...] were <b>all</b> <b>looking</b> for instant gratification". [...] "Trashy" [...] and [...] "throwaway" [...] were among the band's buzzwords during recording, leading to many tracks in this vein. The chorus of [...] "Ultraviolet (Light My Way)" [...] features the pop lyrical cliché [...] "baby, baby, baby", juxtaposed against the dark lyrics in the verses. Bono wrote the lyrics to [...] "The Fly" [...] in character as the song's eponymous persona by composing a sequence of aphorisms. He called the song [...] "like a crank call from Hell... but [...] likes it there".|$|E
500|$|Following the {{addition}} of guitarist Henry McCullough, Wings' first concert tour began in 1972 with a debut performance {{in front of an}} audience of seven hundred at the University of Nottingham. Ten more gigs followed as they travelled across the UK in a van during an unannounced tour of universities, during which the band stayed in modest accommodation and received pay in coinage collected from students, while avoiding Beatles songs during their performances. McCartney later said, [...] "The main thing I didn't want was to come on stage, faced with the whole torment of five rows of press people with little pads, <b>all</b> <b>looking</b> at me and saying, 'Oh well, he is not as good as he was.' So we decided to go out on that university tour which made me less nervous... by the end of that tour I felt ready for something else, so we went into Europe." [...] During the seven-week, 25-show Wings Over Europe Tour, the band played almost solely Wings and McCartney solo material: the Little Richard cover [...] "Long Tall Sally" [...] was the only song that had previously been recorded by the Beatles. McCartney wanted the tour to avoid large venues; most of the small halls they played had capacities of fewer than 3,000 people.|$|E

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 2009, Hope Boren spoke at signing day about her two sons {{prospects}} for at Ohio State: [...] "As a parent, you always try to raise kids who are happy and successful [...] [...] [...] And I know my kids are happy and I think they'll be successful." [...] Zach Boren said, [...] "Everyone in the whole family is an Ohio State fan now[...] [...]No one cares about Michigan at all anymore. That {{was in the past}} and we're <b>all</b> <b>looking</b> forward to being Buckeyes and staying Buckeyes {{for the rest of our}} lives." [...] During spring practice, Boren impressed his coaches and teammates; however, he refused all interview requests. [...] During the summer, when asked about the impending Michigan – Ohio State game he said [...] "My attitude is there are 11 games before that game,[...] [...]I can't let myself get worked up thinking about that game. I don't want to take a chance of being unprepared for any of the first 11 games. The week that game gets here, it will be my primary focus." [...] By then, he was projected to be the starting left guard, and he was expected to be an important part of the team.|$|E
2500|$|The {{build-up}} {{was long}} and intense, with press speculation over the ability of many players, leading Vaughan to say: [...] "Both sets of players {{are sick and tired}} of talking about the Ashes.

2500|$|The album's opening monologue, [...] "Looking for Love", {{serves as}} a prelude to the album's content of romance and passion. Jackson deciphers society's {{unification}} within the desire for affection in a breathy tone over a spatial and [...] "dreamy" [...] electronic backing: [...] "So many different characters live within us -- <b>all</b> <b>looking</b> for love." [...] The florid discourse was considered [...] "quasi spiritual" [...] and [...] "deeply sensual." ...|$|E

2500|$|Returning to South Carolina, Miles {{was elected}} as a {{delegate}} to the South Carolina secession convention. Miles was for immediate action. [...] On December 17, fearing that even {{a few days of}} delay could be critical, he opposed the relocation of the convention from Columbia to Charleston due to a smallpox outbreak. [...] Miles' last communications with southerners in Washington told him that they were <b>all</b> <b>looking</b> to South Carolina for leadership. [...] Miles attitude was reflected in his statement, “Let us act if we mean to act without talking. [...] Let it be ‘a word and a blow - but the blow first.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 1984, before EastEnders went to air, the show's creators, Tony Holland and Julia Smith, {{attended}} an opening {{evening at the}} Anna Scher Theatre School in North London, {{in order to find}} actors for roles in their upcoming serial. According to Holland and Smith, Anna Scher's school was unlike many other drama schools, where students were [...] "ironed out", <b>all</b> <b>looking</b> and sounding the same. At Anna Scher's school, students' natural personalities and accents were encouraged, [...] "her students aren't taught how to act, they're helped to dig inside themselves and be." [...] In Holland and Smith's own words, this was [...] "just the sort of non-acting that [...] was looking for".|$|E
2500|$|One wrestling {{magazine}} {{described the}} second match as Las futuras estrellas en accion (Spanish for [...] "The future stars in action"), with six wrestlers who were <b>all</b> <b>looking</b> to establish {{themselves as a}} top name in the promotion in the future. On one side {{two of the five}} Los Cancerberos del Infierno ("The Infernal Cerberus), Euforia and Pólvora would be teamed up with the most experienced wrestler in the match, Sangre Azteca. While Azteca was the most experienced he was still looking for an opportunity to [...] "break through" [...] and move up the ranks of CMLL past his current mid-card position. Their opponents was a team that did not usually team up as CMLL decided to team up three of their young tecnicos, Delta, Stuka Jr. and Valiente for the second match of the night, giving all six men the opportunity to perform on a high profile show to demonstrate their skills in the ring.|$|E

2500|$|In 1979, {{the music}} {{industry}} in the United States underwent its worst slump in decades, and disco, despite its mass popularity, was blamed. The producer-oriented sound was having difficulty mixing well with the industry's artist-oriented marketing system. Harold Childs, {{senior vice president at}} A Records, told the Los Angeles Times that [...] "radio is really desperate for rock product" [...] and [...] "they're <b>all</b> <b>looking</b> for some white rock-n-roll". Gloria Gaynor argued that {{the music industry}} supported the destruction of disco because rock music producers were losing money and rock musicians were losing the spotlight. However, disco music remained relatively successful in the early 1980s, with big hits like Irene Cara's [...] "Flashdance... What a Feeling", Michael Jackson's [...] "Thriller", K.C. and the Sunshine Band's last major hit, [...] "Give It Up", and Madonna's first album had strong disco influences. Record producer Giorgio Moroder's soundtracks to American Gigolo, Flashdance and Scarface (which also had a heavy disco influence) proved that the style was still very much embraced. Queen's 1982 album, Hot Space was inspired by the genre as well.|$|E
2500|$|Fitzwilliam {{arrived in}} Balbriggan, Ireland on 4 January 1795. On 10 January {{he wrote to}} the Duke of Portland that [...] "not one day has passed since my arrival without {{intelligence}} being received of violences committed in Westmeath, Meath, Longford and Cavan: Defenderism is there in its greatest force...I find the texture of government very weak" [...] and chaotic. On 15 January he again wrote, claiming that the violence committed by peasants was not political but [...] "merely the outrages of banditti" [...] which could be solved by helping Catholics of rank to preserve law and order. This could only be done by Emancipation: [...] "No time is to be lost, the business will presently be at hand, and the first step I take is of infinite importance". However he [...] "endeavoured to keep clear of any engagement whatever" [...] on Emancipation but that [...] "there is nothing in my answer that they can construe into a rejection {{of what they are}} <b>all</b> <b>looking</b> forward to, the repeal of the remaining restrictive and penal laws": ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, {{one of the}} {{international}} alpine skiing classifiers was Mirre Kipfer. [...] She said [...] "Sometimes athletes try to cheat, to hide what they can really do. [...] They are athletes {{who want to be}} in a class [...] that is more advantageous to for them. [...] In testing and classification they don't show what they can really do. [...] They try to show that they are not able to do some movement, and that is why we have started functional testing." [...] She goes on to say [...] "The second problem is that when you have a very good athlete who is very well trained in the sport, you don't want to punish that person for their good performance. [...] He or she might be an elite athlete doing a very good sport performance, and you might be tempted to say 'OK, he is doing so well he must be in another class.' We do try to get fewer classes so that we don't get, for example, 10 or 12 gold medals in alpine sports. [...] We try to review the classes, but you always have borderline classes and it is always difficult. [...] In winter the aim is to have three classes, like sitting, standing and blind: that is certainly the future that we are <b>all</b> <b>looking</b> to." ...|$|E
