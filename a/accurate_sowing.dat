40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} by importance and possibilities of winter oilseed rape growths foundation. At first, thesis briefly describes characteristics of oilseed rape and its life cycle. At second, thesis summarizes {{the information about}} demands for nutrients of particular elements which are necessary for optimal yield index, health condition, problematic of adverse effects and hibernation, diversity of species and quality of seed production. Possibilities of growths founding are related to growing technologies, which are given by experience of leading worker and financial possibilities of a company. First possibility how to prepare ideal conditions for evolution and growth is usage of classic soil preparation. Thus to use a tillage which guarantees a quality conditions for strong and deep root, which is resistant to low temperatures and pulling off the soil, therefore to losses of plants and so that to decreases of yield. Next possibility {{is to use a}} system of minimizing preparation of soil, where the tillage is skipped and replaced by loosening of soil. In this process we to thoroughly take into account weed and second growth. In the last years the second system becomes more significant. Last system to found a growth is usage of direct sowing. This system is known as soil-protective cultivation and is used when {{there is a lack of}} time to prepare seedbed. The objective of the thesis is to determine the possibilities of oilseed rape growths foundation and to explain which differences and advantages are available in particular cases. Results of the researches show that the most suitable system is to process the soil by tillage and to use sowing combination. It guarantees <b>accurate</b> <b>sowing</b> and minimizes harvest losses...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis were: i) {{to determine the}} minimum time required to record data from each individual load cell in the force plate system {{in order to obtain}} <b>accurate</b> <b>sow</b> weight distributions on each leg to objectively detect lameness, and ii) to develop a lameness detection decision tree from the force plate output collected in a commercial setting. In the first study, lameness was induced in 12 multiparous sows using a chemical synovitis model. Weight applied to each foot was recorded twice per second for 15 min on days - 1, + 1, + 6, and + 10 relative to lameness induction. Results suggest that there could be potential data collection problems after 12 min; therefore, 10 min was considered the maximum time required for weight recordings. Utilizing a 30 sec burn-in period to allow sows to become acquainted with the force plate, 30 to 210 sec was the time period that had the best combination of different readings and speed of collection compared to 30 to 630 sec. In the second study, one force plate was installed under an electronic sow feeder (ESF) in a dynamic group sow housing system with 120 multiparous sows for 21 days. Force applied by each foot was recorded once per second after the sow stood squarely on the plate and applied pressure to all quadrants during her first daily visit to the ESF. Sows were visually lameness scored using a four-point scale on a weekly basis. A decision tree was created using the variables that were deemed as more important for accurate lameness detection. The classification tree was 96 % similar to weekly visual lameness identification. When comparing the output from the daily classification tree to a weekly visual lameness assessment, the force plate was able to identify lameness almost 5 days before it was visually assessed. Results from this thesis can be used to improve the embedded microcomputer-based force plate use efficiency when evaluating sow lameness and could help to identify lameness before clinical signs become evident...|$|R
40|$|The {{length of}} the crop season is a major {{determinant}} of yields in Sahel. Higher variability being observed on when the season starts rather than when it finishes, <b>accurate</b> estimates of <b>sowing</b> dates are vital for yield forecasting and consequently food-security. Based on green-up onset detections derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series at 250 m, this paper proposes a new methodology for their estimation. It builds upon a stochastic model that translates vegetation onsets detected around villages in sowing probabilities. Results for Niger show that it outperforms the standard method adopted in the region based on rainfall thresholds. Vegetation onsets, defined as the transition from a bare to a vegetated surface, are detected by the method proposed by Pekel et al. (2010). The selection of this method is threefold motivated: (i) it exploits the multi-spectral information and consequently avoids usual confusions between bare soils and vegetation, (ii) it synthetizes multi-spectral information in one value, and (iii) it reduces the noise due to the observation conditions. The proportion of vegetated pixels around each village is then computed in a buffer of 5 km and converted into a probability of sowing. Adopting a parsimonious position, only two parameters are estimated in the conversion process. The number of villages having sowed by decade and by department is assumed to follow a Poisson-Binomial distribution. The parameters are then obtained by maximizing the likelihood of observing the figures officially stated by the Nigerien Ministry of Agriculture for the years 2008 and 2009. Cross validation between years shows that despite the apparent absolute difference on the estimated parameters, the method generates significantly higher R-squares and lower root mean square errors (RMSE) when compared with estimations based on rainfall thresholds (between 8 % to 18 % higher R-squares and 17 % to 29 % lower RMSE). This improvement can be explained, among others, by the higher spatial resolution of the input data (250 m for the vegetation onsets against 10 km for rainfall estimates), which is more consistent with the higher weather spatial variability in the area.
