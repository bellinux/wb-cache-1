40|$|The {{closing of}} tax loopholes is one {{important}} instrument for fiscal consolidation. We {{concentrate on the}} value added tax exemption of banking services in Germany. The potential tax revenue under full value added taxation cannot be estimated from national accounting data, as {{it is necessary to}} <b>apportion</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> added between final consumption and intermediate production. We develop a method which allows to base our estimates on disaggregated banks' balance sheet data and obtain an estimate for the lower bound of the net revenue loss of tax exemption to the order of 7 bill.

50|$|Where a lessee is evicted from, or surrenders or forfeits {{possession}} {{of part of}} the property leased to him, he becomes liable at common law to pay only a rent <b>apportioned</b> to <b>the</b> <b>value</b> of <b>the</b> interest which he still retains. So where the person entitled to the reversion of an estate assigns part of it, the right to an <b>apportioned</b> part of <b>the</b> rent incident to the England, and {{in many of the}} British colonies.

40|$|Unreasonably large damages {{awards in}} patent {{litigation}} {{have been an}} important force in motivating the movement for patent reform. "Apportionment" has found support {{as a solution to}} problem damages awards. Under apportionment, the portion of <b>the</b> overall <b>value</b> of <b>the</b> product that is "attributable" to the patented technology is identified. Then, reasonable royalty damages are calculated with reference to this <b>apportioned</b> <b>value</b> of <b>the</b> patented technology rather than <b>the</b> overall <b>value</b> of <b>the</b> product. While the problems that have motivated the apportionment movement are real and serious, apportionment makes sense as a solution only under the assumption that an economically invalid approach to calculating damages is being taken in the first place. A more sensible solution is to require litigants to take an economically valid approach to damages. In addition, when there are complementarities between assets, such that the combined use of two or more assets is worth more than their individual use, no unique way exists to <b>apportion</b> <b>the</b> overall <b>value</b> of <b>the</b> product among the assets (including the patented technology at issue), rendering apportionment infeasible in many cases. We consider these and other issues that surround apportionment...|$|R
