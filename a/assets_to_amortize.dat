50|$|Under §197 most {{acquired}} intangible <b>assets</b> are <b>to</b> be <b>amortized</b> ratably over a fifteen-year period. This is not {{the best}} treatment of an intangible whose actual life is much shorter than fifteen years. Furthermore, if an intangible is not eligible for amortization under § 197, the taxpayer can depreciate the asset if there is a showing of the assets useful life.|$|R
50|$|When the {{purchaser}} of an intangible <b>asset</b> {{is allowed}} <b>to</b> <b>amortize</b> {{the price of}} the asset as an expense for tax purposes, the value of the asset is enhanced by this tax amortization benefit. Specifically, the fair market value of the asset is increased by the present value of the future tax savings derived from the tax amortization of the asset. The present value of these savings is to be estimated and included {{as a part of the}} fair market value when valuing an intangible asset.|$|R
50|$|Intangible assets lack of {{physical}} substance and usually are {{very hard to}} evaluate.

50|$|This {{approach}} is also called an acquisition cost model. This method measures the organization’s investment in employees using the five parameters: recruiting, acquisition, formal training and familiarization, informal training and informal familiarization, and experience and development. This model suggests {{that instead of}} charging the costs to {{profit and loss statement}} (p&l) accounting, it should be capitalized in the balance sheet. The process of giving a status of <b>asset</b> <b>to</b> the expenditure item is called capitalization. In human resource management, it is necessary <b>to</b> <b>amortize</b> the capitalized amount over a period of time. So, here one will take the age of the employee at the time of recruitment and at the time of retirement. Out of these, a few employees may leave the organization before attaining the superannuation.This method is the only method of Human Resource Accounting that is based on sound accounting principles and policies.|$|R

40|$|Subdivision {{surfaces}} are the modeling primitive {{of choice for}} most production studios. Scanline rendering of subdivision surfaces via tessellation is relatively straightforward due to the in-order nature of the geometry processing, but directly ray tracing them is more complicated. Intersecting a single ray with a patch of faces requires that the patch be subdivided to a sufficiently dense level; in a naive implementation this process is repeated for every ray that hits the same patch. <b>To</b> <b>amortize</b> the cost of subdivision, previous approaches have either pre-tessellated the entire scene and traced it as triangles (often requiring {{a large amount of}} memory), or tessellated parts of the scene on demand and cached them. In this paper, we propose an approach that instead uses large packets <b>to</b> <b>amortize</b> the cost of subdivision. The proposed method performs competitively with pre-tessellation, outperforms a single-ray implementation by up to 16 × and Pixars PRMan by up to 11 ×. ...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{literature}} has documented that women earn significantly lower returns {{than men to}} investing in professional degrees. However, these papers have not addressed {{the question of whether}} this gap is large enough to render professional degrees poor financial investments for women. To study this, we examine whether becoming a physician is a positive net-present-value investment for women. We sidestep some selection issues associated with measuring the returns to education by comparing physicians to physician assistants, a similar profession with lower wages but much lower up-front training costs. We find that the median female (but not male) primary-care physician would have been financially better off becoming a physician assistant. This result is partially due to a gender-wage gap in medicine. However, it is mostly driven {{by the fact that the}} median female physician simply doesn’t work enough hours <b>to</b> <b>amortize</b> her upfront investment in medical school. In contrast, the median male physician work many more hours, easily enough <b>to</b> <b>amortize</b> his up-front investment. We discuss the robustness of our results to other medical specialties and their relevance to gender-wage gaps more broadly. We discuss other sources of returns to education that rationalize these investments by women...|$|R
40|$|After {{several years}} of {{increasing}} pension expenses in the municipalities of Norway, a regulatory change was introduced in 2002 to equalize these expenses. With this change a new concept of pension accounting arose that caused a deviation, which can be explained briefly as {{the difference between the}} net pension expense and the contributed pension premium. Municipalities were given the option <b>to</b> <b>amortize</b> this deviation over either 1 year or 15 years. The municipality of Haugesund, like most, chose the second option. This study examines Haugesund's annual accounts and balance sheets for the years 2002 - 2016, to evaluate the consequences of this regulatory change on the municipality's financial performance. We used both qualitative and quantitative methods of data collection, analysis and interpretation. The data that form the basis for our conclusion are derived from interviews, annual accounts, and pension notes associated with Haugesund municipality. Our results show that the introduction of this deviation, and the option <b>to</b> <b>amortize</b> this deviation over several years, positively affected the municipality's net operating profit. The results also show that amortization of this deviation over one year would have given the municipality a weaker result...|$|R

50|$|For example, {{because there}} are no {{standard}} protocols for creating and destroying LUNs and volumes, most virtual infrastructures store many VMs on a single LUN or volume <b>to</b> <b>amortize</b> provisioning and management overhead. Since general-purpose storage systems implement most storage-management functionality such as monitoring, snapshots, cloning, replication and QoS on LUNs and volumes rather than VMs and virtual disks, this means storage systems lose the ability to perform these operations on individual VMs. Advance planning becomes necessary to effectively manage storage.|$|R

While the current prohibition on amortization protects individual rights and is thus laudable as a liberty-friendly law, it goes too far by categorically refusing to give any account for the public interest. A revised statute allowing amortization, but only when the government satisfies a substantial burden to demonstrate its “reasonableness,” including a showing that the property <b>to</b> be <b>amortized</b> can be put to reasonable alternate use, would properly recognize important (albeit competing) individual and collective interests.
