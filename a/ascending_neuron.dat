40|$|The {{auditory}} {{system of}} the cricket has the unusual {{ability to respond to}} deafferentation by compensatory growth and synapse formation. Auditory interneurons such as <b>ascending</b> <b>neuron</b> 2 (AN- 2) in the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus possess a dendritic arbor that normally grows up to, but not over, the midline of the prothoracic ganglion. After chronic deafferentation throughout larval development, however, the AN- 2 dendritic arbor changes dramatically, and medial dendrites sprout across the midline where they form compensatory synapses with the auditory afferents from the contralateral ear. We quantified the extent of the effects of chronic, unilateral deafferentation by measuring several cellular parameters of 3 different neuronal components of the auditory system: the deafferented AN- 2, the contralateral (or nondeafferented) AN- 2 and the contralateral auditory afferents. Neuronal tracers and confocal microscopy were used to visualize neurons, and double-label experiments were performed to examine the cellular relationship between pairs of cells. Dendritic complexity was quantified using a modified Sholl analysis, and the length and volume of processes and presynaptic varicosities were assessed under control and deafferented conditions. Chronic deafferentation significantly influenced the morphology of all 3 neuronal components examined. The overall dendritic complexity of the deafferented AN- 2 dendritic arbor was reduced, while both the contralateral AN- 2 dendritic arbor and the remaining, intact, auditory afferents grew longer. We found no significant changes in the volume or density of varicosities after deafferentation. These complex cellular changes after deafferentation are interpreted {{in the light of the}} reported differential regulation of vesicle-associated membrane protein and semaphorin 2 a...|$|E
40|$|Using {{modulation}} transfer functions (MTF), {{we investigated}} how sound patterns are processed within the auditory pathway of grasshoppers. Spike rates of auditory receptors and primary-like local neurons did {{not depend on}} modulation frequencies while other local and <b>ascending</b> <b>neurons</b> had lowpass, bandpass or bandstop properties. Local neurons exhibited broader dynamic ranges of their rate MTF that extended to higher modulation frequencies than those of most <b>ascending</b> <b>neurons.</b> We found no indication that a filter bank for modulation frequencies may exist in grasshoppers as has been proposed for the auditory system of mammals. The filter properties of half of the neurons changed to an allpass type with a 50 % reduction of modulation depths. Contrasting to reports for mammals, the sensitivity to small modulation depths was not enhanced at higher processing stages. In <b>ascending</b> <b>neurons,</b> {{a focus on the}} range of low modulation frequencies was visible in the temporal MTFs, which describe the temporal locking of spikes to the signal envelope. To investigate the influence of stimulus rise time, we used rectangularly modulated stimuli instead of sinusoidally modulated ones.

40|$|The {{recognition}} of the male calling song is essential for phonotaxis in female crickets. We investigated the responses toward different models of song patterns by ascending, local, and descending neurons in the brain of standing and walking crickets. We describe results for two ascending, three local, and two descending interneurons. Characteristic dendritic and axonal arborizations of the local and descending neurons indicate a flow of auditory information from the ascending interneurons toward the lateral accessory lobes and point toward the relevance of this brain region for cricket phonotaxis. Two aspects of auditory processing were studied: the tuning of interneuron activity to pulse repetition rate and the precision of pattern copying. Whereas <b>ascending</b> <b>neurons</b> exhibited weak, low-pass properties, local neurons showed both low- and band-pass properties, and descending neurons represented clear band-pass filters. Accurate copying of single pulses was found at all three levels of the auditory pathway. Animals were walking on a trackball, which allowed {{an assessment of the}} effect that walking has on auditory processing. During walking, all neurons were additionally activated, and in most neurons, the spike rate was correlated to walking velocity. The number of spikes elicited by a chirp increased with walking only in <b>ascending</b> <b>neurons,</b> whereas the peak instantaneous spike rate of the auditory responses increased on all levels of the processing pathway. Extra spiking activity resulted in a somewhat degraded copying of the pulse pattern in most neurons...|$|R
40|$|Most land animals {{normally}} walk forward but {{switch to}} backward walking upon sensing an obstacle or {{danger in the}} path ahead. A change in walking direction {{is likely to be}} triggered by descending “command” neurons from the brain that act upon local motor circuits to alter the timing of leg muscle activation. Here we identify descending neurons for backward walking in Drosophila—the MDN neurons. MDN activity is required for flies to walk backward when they encounter an impassable barrier and is sufficient to trigger backward walking under conditions in which flies would otherwise walk forward. We also identify <b>ascending</b> <b>neurons,</b> MAN, that promote persistent backward walking, possibly by inhibiting forward walking. These findings provide an initial glimpse into the circuits and logic that control walking direction in Drosophila...|$|R

Immunohistochemical data showed that p 75 NTR was expressed in {{only a very small}} subset of ascending sensory axons but not in any corticospinal axons in the dorsal column of either normal or injured spinal cord. Using p 75 NTR-deficient mice, we showed that the depletion of the functional p 75 NTR did not promote the regeneration of the descending corticospinal tract and <b>ascending</b> sensory <b>neurons</b> in the spinal cord 2 weeks after spinal cord injury. Local administration of p 75 NTR-Fc fusion molecule, the dominant-negative receptor to block the function of neurite outgrowth inhibitors, did not improve regeneration of <b>ascending</b> sensory <b>neurons</b> in the injured spinal cord.

40|$|International audienceThe {{receiver}} sensory system plays {{a crucial}} role in the evolution of new communication signals in insects. Among acoustic communicating crickets, the tribe Lebinthini (Eneopterinae) has evolved a unique communication system in that males produce exceptionally high-frequency calls and females respond with vibratory signals to guide males towards them. In this study, we describe nine species of Eneopterinae in which the sound receiving structures have undergone considerable morphological changes. We revealed that the anterior tympanal membrane (ATM) of the ear was extremely thin, as little as 0. 35 [*]µm thick, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the thinnest tympanal membrane found in crickets thus far. Measurements of tympanum vibrations obtained from Lebinthus bitaeniatus demonstrated a strong sensitivity towards higher frequencies. The finding also coincides with the neuronal tuning of <b>ascending</b> <b>neurons</b> and the behavioural response of the Lebinthini. The morphologically specialized ATM and its mechanical sensitivity for high frequencies, therefore, may have driven the sensory exploitation of an anti-predator behaviour that led to the evolution of a new communication system known for this group of crickets.

40|$|The {{role of the}} midline {{floor plate}} cells in the {{neuronal}} differentiation of the spinal cord was examined by comparing putative GABAergic neurons in wildtype zebrafish embryos with those in cyc- 1 mutant embryos. The mutation produces a pleiotropic recessive lethal phenotype and is severe in rostral brain regions, but its direct effect in the caudal hindbrain and the spinal cord is apparently restricted to the depletion of the midline floor plate cells. In wildtype embryos, an antibody against the neurotransmitter GABA labeled the cell bodies, axons, and growth cones of three classes of previously identified neurons; dorsal longitudinal neurons (DoLA), commissural secondary <b>ascending</b> <b>neurons</b> (CoSA), and ventral longitudinal neurons (VeLD). A novel ventral cell type, Kolmer-Agduhr (KA) neurons, was also labeled. In the cyc- 1 mutant, abnormalities were observed in some, but not all, of the GABAreactive CoSA, VeLD, and KA axons, while the axonal trajectories of DoLA neurons were not affected. Furthermore, the number of KA cells was reduced in the mutant while the numbers of the other GABAreactive cells were unperturbed. These observations corroborate our earlier hypothesis that the floor plate cells are one of several guidance cues that direct axonal outgrowth near the ventral midline of the spinal cord. They also suggest that the floor plate cells {{may play a role}} in the cellular differentiation of the spinal cord of zebrafish embryos. © 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

40|$|The {{establishment}} of initial axonal pathways in the embryonic brain of Drosophila melanogaster was investigated at the cellular and molecular level using antibody probes, enhancer detector strains and axonal pathfinding mutants. During embryogenesis, two bilaterally symmetrical cephalic neurogenic regions form, which are initially separated {{from each other}} and from the ventral nerve cord. The brain commissure that interconnects the two brain hemispheres is pioneered by axons that project towards the midline in close association with an interhemispheric cellular bridge. The descending longitudinal pathways that interconnect the brain to the ventral nerve cord are prefigured by a chain of longitudinal glial cells and a cellular bridge between brain and subesophageal ganglion; pioneering descending and <b>ascending</b> <b>neurons</b> grow in close association with these structures. The formation of the embryonic commissural and longitudinal pathways is dependent on cells of the CNS midline. Mutations in the commissureless gene, which affects growth cone guidance towards the midline, result in a marked reduction of the brain commissure. Mutations in the single-minded gene and in other spitz group genes, which affect the differentiation of CNS midline cells, result in the absence or aberrant projection of longitudinal pathways. The analysis of axon pathway formation presented here reveals remarkable similarities as well as distinct differences in the embryonic development of the brain and the segmental ganglia, and forms the basis for a comprehensive genetic and molecular genetic dissection of axonal pathfinding processes in the developing brain...|$|R

40|$|Object {{recognition}} {{is a fundamental}} function of the auditory system, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Acoustic communication in the Tettigoniid genus Neoconocephalus provides a useful system for studying these mechanisms. We examined the ascending interneuron pathway in three Neoconocephalus species with diverse calls and recognition mechanisms. This pathway processes spectral information and transmits call temporal patterns to the supraesophageal ganglion where the recognition circuits reside. For each species, we describe one local auditory interneuron (ON) and three with ascending projections (AN- 1, AN- 2, TN- 1), which were physiologically and morphologically similar to those described in other Tettigoniids. TN- 1 responded only {{to the beginning of}} call models. For AN- 1, each call model pulse elicited a single action potential in N. robustus and N. bivocatus, whereas every other pulse elicited an action potential in N. triops. Individual pulses did not reliably evoke AN- 2 responses in all three species. AN- 1 responses were limited to frequencies < 20 kHz. AN- 1 tuning differed among the three species, reflecting their differences in the dominant frequency of the calls. AN- 2 was broadly tuned, and responses increased with intensity in all three species. In behavioral experiments, N. robustus showed greater spectral selectivity than the other two species. Adding the second harmonic to the spectrum of call models suppressed phonotaxis in N. robustus, but not N. triops or N. bivocatus. Adding the second harmonic reduced AN- 1 responses in N. robustus but not in the other two species.

40|$|Background: The {{blood brain barrier}} (BBB) and {{truncated}} trkB receptor on astrocytes {{prevent the}} penetration of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) applied into the peripheral (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) thus restrict its application {{in the treatment of}} nervous diseases. As BDNF is anterogradely transported by axons, we propose that peripherally derived and/or applied BDNF may act on the regeneration of central axons of <b>ascending</b> sensory <b>neurons.</b> Methodology/Principal Findings: The present study aimed to test the hypothesis by using conditioning lesion of the sciatic nerve as a model to increase the expression of endogenous BDNF in sensory neurons and by injecting exogenous BDNF into the peripheral nerve or tissues. Here we showed that most of regenerating sensory neurons expressed BDNF and p-CREB but not p 75 NTR. Conditioning-lesion induced regeneration of <b>ascending</b> sensory <b>neuron</b> and {{the increase in the number}} of p-Erk positive and GAP- 43 positive neurons was blocked by the injection of the BDNF antiserum in the periphery. Enhanced neurite outgrowth of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons in vitro by conditioning lesion was also inhibited by the neutralization with the BDNF antiserum. The delivery of exogenous BDNF into the sciatic nerve or the footpad significantly increased the number of regenerating DRG neurons and regenerating sensory axons in the injured spinal cord. In a contusion injury model, an injection of BDNF into the footpad promoted recovery of motor functions.

40|$|Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is {{the main}} {{inhibitory}} neurotransmitter in the brain. Recent technological advances have illuminated the role of GABAergic neurons in control of cortical arousal and sleep. Sleep-promoting GABAergic neurons in the preoptic hypothalamus are well-known. Less well appreciated are GABAergic projection neurons in the brainstem, midbrain, hypothalamus and basal forebrain which paradoxically promote arousal and fast electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms. Thus, GABA is not purely a sleep-promoting neurotransmitter. GABAergic projection neurons in the brainstem nucleus incertus and ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden promote theta (4 - 8 Hz) rhythms. Ventral tegmental area GABAergic neurons, neighboring midbrain dopamine neurons, project to the frontal cortex and nucleus accumbens. They discharge faster during cortical arousal, and regulate reward. Thalamic reticular nucleus GABAergic neurons initiate sleep spindles in non-REM sleep. In addition, however, during wakefulness they tonically regulate the activity of thalamocortical neurons. Other GABAergic inputs to the thalamus arising in the globus pallidus pars interna, substantia nigra pars reticulata, zona incerta and basal forebrain regulate motor activity, arousal, attention and sensory transmission. Several subpopulations of cortically-projecting GABAergic neurons in the basal forebrain project to the thalamus and neocortex and preferentially promote cortical gamma-band (30 - 80 Hz) activity and wakefulness. Unlike sleep-active GABAergic <b>neurons,</b> these <b>ascending</b> GABAergic <b>neurons</b> are fast-firing neurons which disinhibit and synchronize the activity of their forebrain targets, promoting the fast EEG rhythms typical of conscious states.

40|$|Dendrite and axon {{growth and}} {{branching}} during development are regulated by {{a complex set}} of intracellular and external signals. However, the cues that maintain or influence adult neuronal morphology are less well understood. Injury and deafferentation tend to have negative effects on adult nervous systems. An interesting example of injury-induced compensatory growth is seen in the cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus. After unilateral loss of an ear in the adult cricket, auditory neurons within the central nervous system sprout to compensate for the injury. Specifically, after being deafferented, <b>ascending</b> <b>neurons</b> (AN- 1 and AN- 2) send dendrites across the midline of the prothoracic ganglion where they receive input from auditory afferents that project through the contralateral auditory nerve (N 5). Deafferentation also triggers contralateral N 5 axonal growth. In this study, we quantified AN dendritic and N 5 axonal growth at 30 hours, as well as at 3, 5, 7, 14 and 20 days after deafferentation in adult crickets. Significant differences in the rates of dendritic growth between males and females were noted. In females, dendritic growth rates were non-linear; a rapid burst of dendritic extension in the first few days was followed by a plateau reached at 3 days after deafferentation. In males, however, dendritic growth rates were linear, with dendrites growing steadily over time and reaching lengths, on average, twice as long as in females. On the other hand, rates of N 5 axonal growth showed no significant sexual dimorphism and were linear. Within each animal, the growth rates of dendrites and axons were not correlated, indicating that independent factors likely influence dendritic and axonal growth in response to injury in this system. Our findings provide a basis for future study of the cellular features that allow differing dendrite and axon growth patterns as well as sexually dimorphic dendritic growth in response to deafferentation...|$|R
40|$|SummaryA {{deficient}} {{extinction of}} memory {{is particularly important}} in the regime of fear, where it limits the beneficial outcomes of treatments of anxiety disorders. Fear extinction is thought to involve inhibitory influences of the prefrontal cortex on the amygdala, although the detailed synaptic mechanisms remain unknown.

An NPS receptor antagonist exerts functionally opposing responses, indicating that endogenous NPS is involved in anxiety behavior and extinction. Cellularly, NPS increases glutamatergic transmission to intercalated GABAergic neurons in the amygdala via presynaptic NPS receptors on connected principal neurons. These results identify mechanisms of NPS in the brain, a key role of intercalated neurons in the amygdala for fear extinction, and a potential pharmacological avenue for treating anxiety disorders...|$|R
40|$|We {{used the}} {{auditory}} system of crickets {{as a model}} system to examine the importance of temporal coding in sensory processing. The bilaterally paired <b>Ascending</b> <b>Neurons</b> 1 and 2 (AN 1 and AN 2) of crickets receive inputs from the auditory receptors {{on one side and}} carry the information to the brain. We used stimuli with either conspecific-like or predator-like (i. e. bats) carrier frequency to quantify the accuracy with which the interneurons code the information contained within the amplitude modulation (AM) envelope of the stimulus. AN 1, which is tuned to the dominant carrier frequency of cricket songs, selectively codes the limited range of amplitude-modulation frequencies that occur in these signals. AN 2, which is most sensitive to ultrasound, serves as a "bat-detector" and codes a broader range of AM frequencies, as occur in bat calls. A striking characteristic in AN 2 's responses to ultrasound is the presence of bursts of high-frequency spiking separated by relatively sparse spikes. We examined the relative importance of isolated spikes and bursts in the processing of ultrasound. We showed that bursts reliably signal the occurrence of salient amplitude increases. Furthermore, we showed that burst, but not isolated spikes, reliably predict behavioural responses. We suggest AN 2 encodes behaviourally important information with bursts. The Omega Neuron 1 (ON 1) responds to conspecific signals and to the ultrasonic echolocation sounds. ON 1 's temporal coding properties vary with carrier frequency, allowing it to encode both of these behaviourally important signals. Furthermore, the temporal coding properties of ON 1 in response to cricket-like sound and bat-like sound match those of AN 1 and AN 2 respectively. ON 1 is a source of contralateral inhibition to AN 1 and AN 2, enhancing binaural contrast and facilitating sound localization. We used dichotic stimulation to examine the importance of the temporal structure of contralateral inhibition for enhancing binaural contrast. Contralateral inhibition degrades the accuracy with which amplitude modulation is encoded by AN 1 and AN 2, but only if the temporal pattern of inhibitory input matches that of excitation. Our results show that the CF-specific coding properties of ON 1 allow this single neuron to enhance localization cues most effectively for both cricket-like and bat-like acoustic signals...|$|R
40|$|Morphological and {{pharmacological}} data suggest {{the existence of}} a reciprocal interaction between the mesencephalic dopamine (DA) system and the serotonin (5 -HT) system originating in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). In the present work, a DA D 2 receptor-mediated regulation of 5 -HT extracellular concentrations in the DRN is described, by using brain microdialysis in freely moving rats. Local infusion of the nonselective DA agonist apomorphine produced a dose-dependent increase in the extracellular concentration of 5 -HT in the DRN, which was prevented by previous infusion of the specific D 2 antagonist raclopride but not of the D, antagonist SCH- 23390. Furthermore, local infusion of the selective D 2 agonist LY- 171, 555 increased extracellular 5 -HT levels in the DRN, and this effect was also prevented by the previous infusion of raclopride. It is postulated that DA, either from projections from the substantia nigra or the ventral tegmental area or from the DA-containing neurons of the DRN, may increase 5 -HT release in the DRN, which, through autoreceptor stimulation, can profoundly influence the activity of <b>ascending</b> serotoninergic <b>neurons.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Injury to the {{peripheral}} branch of {{dorsal root ganglia}} (DRG) neurons prior to injury to {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) DRG branch results in the regeneration of the central branch. The exact mechanism mediating this regenerative trigger is not fully understood. It has been proposed that following peripheral injury, the intraganglionic inflammatory response by macrophage cells {{plays an important role in}} the pre-conditioning of injured CNS neurons to regenerate. In this study, we investigated whether the presence of macrophage cells is crucial for this type of regeneration to occur. We used a clodronate liposome technique to selectively and temporarily deplete these cells during the conditioning phase of DRG neurons. Results Retrograde and anterograde tracing results indicated that in macrophage-depleted animals, the regenerative trigger characteristic of pre-conditioned DRG neurons was abolished as compared to injury matched-control animals. In addition, depletion of macrophage cells led to: (i) a reduction in macrophage infiltration into the CNS compartment even after cellular repopulation, (ii) astrocyte up-regulation at rostral regions and down-regulation in brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentration in the serum.

While several methods have been explored, only the intersection of two, cell transplantation and biomaterial implantation, will be addressed in detail here. Owing to the constant advance of cell culture technologies, cell-based transplantation has come to the forefront of SCI treatment in order to replace/protect damaged tissue and provide physical as well as trophic support for axonal regrowth. Biomaterial scaffolds provide cells with a protected environment from the surrounding lesion, in addition to bridging extensive damage and providing physical and directional support for axonal regrowth. Moreover, in this combinatorial approach cell transplantation improves scaffold integration and therefore regenerative growth potential.

The stimulation of prefrontal 5 -HT 2 A and AMPA receptors increases pyramidal and serotonergic cell firing, and 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) release in mPFC. As the mPFC contains abundant α 1 -adrenoceptors whose activation increases the excitability of pyramidal neurons, {{we examined the}} effects of their stimulation on local 5 -HT release, using microdialysis. The application of the α 1 -adrenoceptor agonist cirazoline by reverse dialysis increased the prefrontal 5 -HT release in a concentration-dependent manner, an effect antagonized by coperfusion of TTX, prazosin (α 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist), BAY × 3702 (5 -HT 1 A agonist), NBQX (AMPA/KA antagonist) and 1 S, 3 S-ACPD (mGluR II/III agonist), but not by MK- 801 (NMDA antagonist). Cirazoline also enhanced the increase in 5 -HT release induced by DOI (5 -HT 2 A/ 2 C agonist) and AMPA. In addition, M 100907 (5 -HT 2 A antagonist) but not SB- 242084 (5 -HT 2 C antagonist) reversed the cirazoline- and AMPA-induced 5 -HT release.

Priming was induced by apomorphine (0. 1 mg/kg s. c.) or by SKF 38393 (10 mg/kg s. c.) 14 days after 6 -hydroxydopamine lesions and was expressed by challenge with SKF 38393 (3 mg/kg s. c.). In the induction phase of priming, administration of MK 801 (0. 1 mg/kg s. c.) potentiated contralateral turning but differentially influenced stimulation of Fos expression in the caudate-putamen by apomorphine and by SKF 38393. Thus, MK 801 reduced in the expression phase of priming the stimulation of Fos expression by apomorphine in the dorsolateral caudate-putamen, but did not affect that by SKF 38393. MK 801, while preventing priming of SKF 38393 -induced turning by apomorphine, failed to affect priming by SKF 38393.

No such inhibitory effect of MK 801 on SKF 38393 -stimulated Fos expression was observed in rats primed with SKF 38393.

40|$|SummaryRegulation of myelination by oligodendrocytes in the CNS has {{important}} consequences for higher-order nervous system function (e. g., [1 – 4]), {{and there is}} growing consensus that neuronal activity regulates CNS myelination (e. g., [5 – 9]) through local axon-oligodendrocyte synaptic-vesicle-release-mediated signaling [10 – 12]. Recent analyses have indicated that myelination along axons of distinct neuronal subtypes can differ [13, 14], {{but it is not}} known whether regulation of myelination by activity is common to all neuronal subtypes or only some. This limits insight into how specific neurons regulate their own conduction. Here, we use a novel fluorescent fusion protein reporter to study myelination along the axons of distinct neuronal subtypes over time in zebrafish. We find that the axons of reticulospinal and commissural primary <b>ascending</b> (CoPA) <b>neurons</b> are among the first myelinated in the zebrafish CNS. To investigate how activity regulates myelination by different neuronal subtypes, we express tetanus toxin (TeNT) in individual reticulospinal or CoPA neurons to prevent synaptic vesicle release. We find that the axons of individual tetanus toxin expressing reticulospinal neurons have fewer myelin sheaths than controls and that their myelin sheaths are 50 % shorter than controls. In stark contrast, myelination along tetanus-toxin-expressing CoPA neuron axons is entirely normal. These results indicate that while some neuronal subtypes modulate myelination by synaptic vesicle release to a striking degree in vivo, others do not. These data have implications for our understanding of how different neurons regulate myelination and thus their own function within specific neuronal circuits...|$|R
40|$|It has {{previously}} been established that ventral spinocerebellar tract (VSCT) neurons and dorsal spinocerebellar tract neurons located in Clarke's column (CC DSCT neurons) forward information on actions of premotor interneurons in reflex pathways from muscle afferents on α-motoneurons. Whether DSCT neurons located in the dorsal horn (dh DSCT neurons) and spinocervical tract (SCT) neurons are involved in forwarding similar feedback information {{has not yet been}} investigated. The aim {{of the present study was}} therefore to examine the input from premotor interneurons to these neurons. Electrical stimuli were applied within major hindlimb motor nuclei to activate axon-collaterals of interneurons projecting to these nuclei, and intracellular records were obtained from dh DSCT and SCT neurons. Direct actions of the stimulated interneurons were differentiated from indirect actions by latencies of postsynaptic potentials evoked by intraspinal stimuli and by the absence or presence of temporal facilitation. Direct actions of premotor interneurons were found in a smaller proportion of dh DSCT than of CC DSCT neurons. However, they were evoked by both excitatory and inhibitory interneurons, whereas only inhibitory premotor interneurons were previously found to affect CC DSCT neurons [as indicated by monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in dh DSCT and only IPSPs in CC DSCT neurons]. No effects of premotor interneurons were found in SCT neurons, since monosynaptic EPSPs or IPSPs were only evoked in them by stimuli applied outside motor nuclei. The study thus reveals a considerable differentiation of feedback information provided by different populations of <b>ascending</b> tract <b>neurons...</b>|$|R
40|$|Visceral {{hypersensitivity}} is {{the heightened}} response to sensory stimuli. Visceral sensations are transmitted through primary afferent neurons in the {{dorsal root ganglion}} (DRG) and the sensitization of the neural pathway leads to modification in spinal <b>ascending</b> and descending <b>neurons.</b> The aim of this investigation {{is to determine the}} effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its signaling pathway on sensory neuronal activation during colitis. In order to evaluate this, levels of calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP), a neuropeptide marker for nociceptive transmission, and phosphorylated cAMP-response element binding protein (pCREB), a molecular switch in neuronal plasticity, were studied in response to BDNF in vivo and in vitro. Colitis caused an increase in the levels of CGRP and pCREB in thoracolumbar DRG, which was attenuated by BDNF neutralizing antibody and PLC inhibitor, U 73122, but not PI 3 K inhibitor, LY 294002. BDNF-induced CGRP expression and CREB activation in DRG culture was also blocked by PLC inhibitor, U 73122, but not PI 3 K inhibitor, LY 294002, or MEK kinase inhibitor, PD 98059. These results suggest a unique signaling pathway, i. e. the PLC-γ pathway, is mediating BDNF action on sensory neuronal activation during colitis...|$|R
50|$|In the dorsal column-medial leminiscus tract, {{a primary}} neuron's axon enters {{the spinal cord}} and then enters the dorsal column. If the primary axon enters below spinal level T6, the axon travels in the {{fasciculus}} gracilis, the medial part of the column. If the axon enters above level T6, then it travels in the fasciculus cuneatus, which is lateral to the fasciculus gracilis. Either way, the primary axon ascends to the lower medulla, where it leaves its fasciculus and synapses with a secondary neuron {{in one of the}} dorsal column nuclei: either the nucleus gracilis or the nucleus cuneatus, depending on the pathway it took. At this point, the secondary axon leaves its nucleus and passes anteriorly and medially. The collection of secondary axons that do this are known as internal arcuate fibers. The internal arcuate fibers decussate and continue ascending as the contralateral medial lemniscus. Secondary axons from the medial lemniscus finally terminate in the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL) of the thalamus, where they synapse with tertiary neurons. From there, tertiary <b>neurons</b> <b>ascend</b> via the posterior limb of the internal capsule and end in the primary sensory cortex.|$|R

While the importance of the female preference for exaggerated male traits is largely understood, the evolutionary origins remain under debate. During the evolution of the female preference for leading signals via a sensory bias, an important factor is the processing of sensory information. In katydids, contralateral inhibition on two bilaterally paired <b>ascending</b> auditory <b>neurons</b> (AN 1 & TN 1) acts to enhance directionality of neural responses to a male call, but may also act to suppress responses on the side of following calls. Here, I investigate the sensory processing underlying the preference for leading calls (LP) in Neoconocephalus katydids and test for a sensory bias in a phylogenetic and behavioral context. When presented with three different chirp patterns, AN 1 and TN 1 responded directionally, but no leader bias was found in AN 1. There was a strong leader bias in TN 1, but only for the call model of N. ensiger, a species with LP. These results for AN 1 and TN 1 were similar in all species tested, both with and without LP. The strength of the leader bias in TN 1 was reduced after removing contralateral auditory inputs by cutting the contralateral leg. The leader bias in N. ensiger correlates to LP, suggesting that this LP may be due to a sensory bias mechanism but only after TN 1 was incorporated into call recognition. Alternatively, TN 1 might not be important for LP if higher centers in the auditory system extract the location of the leading call from other auditory neurons, such as AN 1...|$|R
40|$|In adult rats bearing {{unilateral}} 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) lesions of the <b>ascending</b> dopaminergic <b>neurons,</b> {{a single}} administration of a dopamine (DA) receptor agonist results in strong sensitization (''priming'') of contralateral turning {{in response to}} D 2 and particularly Dl receptor agonists. In order to investigate the role of distinct environmental cues associated with {{the effect of the}} agonist during exposure to the primer, rats bearing 15 -day-old unilateral 6 -OHDA lesions were primed in their home cage with L-dopa or with saline. L-Dopa but not saline induced medium to low but steady contralateral turning. Three days later, challenge with the D 1 agonist SKF 38393 in the home cage also resulted in contralateral turning in the rats previously primed with L-dopa, but not in those primed with saline. In a second experiment rats lesioned with 6 -OHDA were primed in two different contexts (hemispheres versus cylinders) with a single administration of the D 2 /D 3 agonist quinpirole (LY 171555 : 0. 2 mg/kg s. c.) or saline. Three days later the rats were placed in hemispheres and tested for contraversive turning in response to saline or to SKF 38393. SKF 38393 elicited high rate contraversive turning independently of the environment where priming with quinpirole took place; on the other hand no conditioned contraversive turning was observed after saline. In a third experiment, the possibility of priming SKF 38393 -induced turning by stimulation of nigral or striatal DA receptors was investigated. Rats lesioned unilaterally with 6 -OHDA were locally infused on the lesioned side in the substantia nigra with SKF 38393 or in the striatum with quinpirole. Both these treatments elicited contralateral turning, the intranigral injection of SKF 38393 eliciting a stronger and longer lasting contraversive turning than intrastriatal quinpirole. Challenge with SKF 38393 (3 mg/kg s. c.) 3 days later induced contralateral turning only in rats previously primed with intrastriatal quinpirole. The results of these studies are consistent with the idea that ''priming'' is an example of non-associative sensitization induced by stimulation of denervated striatal DA receptors and expressed as an increased efficiency of post-synaptic dopaminergic transduction in the striatum...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is focused}} on dissecting the functional role of two anatomically-defined pathways in the adult rat spinal cord. A TetOn dual virus system was used to selectively and reversibly induce enhanced tetanus neurotoxin expression in L 2 neurons that project to L 5 (L 2 -L 5) or C 6 (long <b>ascending</b> propriospinal <b>neurons,</b> LAPNs). Results focus on the changes observed during overground locomotion. The dissertation is divided into four chapters. Chapter One is a focused introduction to locomotion, including its broad description, the central mechanisms of its expression, how genetic-based approaches defined these mechanisms, and the limitations in these approaches. It concludes with details of the silencing paradigm used here and {{a summary of the}} main findings. Chapter Two describes the functional consequences of silencing L 2 -L 5 interneurons. The focus is on selective disruption of hindlimb coordination during overground locomotion, revealing a continuum from walk to hop. These changes are independent of speed, step frequency, and other spatiotemporal features of gait. Left-right alternation was restored during swimming and stereotypic exploration, suggesting a task-specific role. Silencing L 2 -L 5 interneurons partially uncoupled the hindlimbs, allowing spontaneous shifts in coordination on a step-by-step basis. It is proposed this pathway distributes temporal information for left-right hindlimb alternation, securing effective coordination in a context-dependent manner. Chapter Three focuses on the consequences of silencing LAPNs. Three patterns of interlimb coupling are disrupted: left-right forelimb, left-right hindlimb, and contralateral hindlimb-forelimb coordination. Observed again was a context-dependent continuum from walk-to-hop, irrespective of step frequency, speed, and the salient features that define locomotion. However, instead of spontaneous shifts in coordination as observed from L 2 -L 5 interneuron silencing, the breadth of coupling patterns expressed were maintained on a step-by-step basis. It is proposed that this ascending, inter-enlargement pathway distributes temporal information required for left-right alternation at the shoulder and pelvic girdles in a context-dependent manner. Collectively, these data suggest that L 2 -L 5 interneurons and LAPNs are key pathways that distribute left-right patterning information throughout the neuraxis. The functional role(s) of these pathways are exquisitely gated to the context at hand, suggesting that the locomotor circuitry undergoes functional reorganization thereby endowing or masking the silencing-induced disruptions to interlimb coordination...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} retrograde tracer transport by gastric enteric neurons in insulin resistant mice {{with low}} or high glycosylated hemoglobin (Hb). METHODS: Under anesthesia, the retrograde tracer fluorogold was superficially {{injected into the}} fundus or antrum using a microsyringe in KK Cg-Ay/J mice prior to onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM; 4 wk of age), at onset of T 2 DM (8 wk of age), and after 8, 16, or 24 wk of untreated T 2 DM and in age-matched KK/HIJ mice. Six days later, mice were sacrificed by CO 2 narcosis followed by pneumothorax. Stomachs were removed and fixed. Sections from fundus, corpus and antrum were excised and mounted on a glass slide. Tracer-labeled neurons were viewed using a microscope and manually counted. Data were expressed {{as the number of}} neurons in short and long descending and ascending pathways and in local fundus and antrum pathways, and the number of neurons in all regions labeled after injection of tracer into either the fundus or the antrum. RESULTS: By 8 wk of age, body weights of KKAy mice (n = 12, 34 1; 1 g) were heavier than KK mice (n = 17, 29 1; 1 g; F (4, 120) = 4. 414, P = 0. 002] and glycosylated Hb was higher [KK: (n = 7), 4. 97 % 1; 0. 04 %; KKAy: (n = 6), 6. 57 % 1; 0. 47 %; F (1, 26) = 24. 748, P < 0. 001]. The number of tracer labeled enteric neurons was similar in KK and KKAy mice of all ages in the short descending pathway [F (1, 57) = 2. 374, P = 0. 129], long descending pathway [F (1, 57) = 0. 922, P = 0. 341], local fundus pathway [F (1, 53) = 2. 464, P = 0. 122], local antrum pathway [F (1, 57) = 0. 728, P = 0. 397], and short ascending pathway [F (1, 53) = 2. 940, P = 0. 092]. In the long ascending pathway, fewer tracer-labeled neurons were present in KKAy as compared to KK mice [KK: (n = 34), 302 1; 17; KKAy: (n = 29), 230 1; 15; F (1, 53) = 8. 136, P = 0. 006]. The number of tracer-labeled neurons was decreased in all mice by 16 wk as compared to 8 wk of age in the short descending pathway [8 wk: (n = 15), 305 1; 26; 16 wk: (n = 13), 210 1; 30; F (4, 57) = 9. 336, P < 0. 001], local antrum pathway [8 wk: (n = 15), 349 1; 20; 16 wk: (n = 13), 220 1; 33; F (4, 57) = 8. 920, P < 0. 001], short ascending pathway [8 wk: (n = 14), 392 1; 15; 16 wk: (n = 14), 257 1; 33; F (4, 53) = 17. 188, P < 0. 001], and long ascending pathway [8 wk: (n = 14), 379 1; 39; 16 wk: (n = 14), 235 1; 26; F (4, 53) = 24. 936, P < 0. 001. The number of tracer-labeled neurons decreased at 24 wk of age in the local fundus pathway [8 wk: (n = 14), 33 1; 11; 24 wk: (n = 12), 3 1; 2; F (4, 53) = 5. 195, P = 0. 001] and 32 wk of age in the long descending pathway [8 wk: (n = 15), 16 1; 3; 32 wk: (n = 12), 3 1; 2; F (4, 57) = 2. 944, P = 0. 028]. The number of tracer-labeled enteric neurons was correlated to final body weight for local fundus and ascending pathways [KK: (n = 34), r = - 0. 746, P < 0. 001; KKAy: (n = 29), r = - 0. 842, P < 0. 001] as well as local antrum and descending pathways [KK (n = 36), r = - 0. 660, P < 0. 001; KKAy (n = 31), r = - 0. 622, P < 0. 001). In contrast, glycosylated Hb was not significantly correlated to number of tracer-labeled neurons [KK (n = 17), r = - 0. 164, P = 0. 528; KKAy (n = 16), r = - 0. 078, P = 0. 774].
