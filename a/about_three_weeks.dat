5|$|After {{the chicks}} hatch, the birds will desert their nest. Even though the young can swim and dive during this time, they rarely do, instead {{staying on the}} parents' backs for four days after hatching. After about 10 days, the parents split the chicks up, with each parent taking care of {{about half of the}} brood. After this split, the chicks are {{independent}} in about 10 days, and fledge in <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|E

5|$|After the floods, {{helicopters}} airlifted {{relief supplies}} like {{food and water}} to isolated villages, and to residents riding out the floods on their roofs. However, relief coordination was disrupted by damaged communication lines and ongoing rainfall. Rescue boats were used to rescue stranded residents. India's Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda provided 500million rupees (US$15million) to help Andhra Pradesh with flood recovery. Conditions returned to normal within 12days of the onslaught of the rains, {{with the exception of}} minor delays to trains.

5|$|Audition was {{originally}} {{started by the}} Japanese company Omega Project, who {{wanted to make a}} horror film after the great financial success of their previous production Ring. To create the film, the company purchased the rights to Ryu Murakami's book Audition, and hired screenwriter Daisuke Tengan and director Miike to film an adaptation. The cast and crew consisted primarily of people Miike had worked with on previous projects, with the exception of Shiina, who had worked as a model prior to beginning a career in film. The film was shot in <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> in Tokyo.|$|E
5|$|It {{is active}} {{throughout}} the year, primarily at night. Gestation is <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks,</b> {{and the female}} has a litter {{of three or four}} young. Nests in the wild, built from shredded bark, are in a tunnel or under a log. Marsh shrews typically live about 18 months, and males are not thought to reach sexual maturity during their first summer. Since their lifespan is short, they apparently breed for only one season. Although no breeding data exist for British Columbia, the breeding season elsewhere is from late January to late August; most young are born in March. The number of litters a female rears is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Electricians had power {{restored}} to the Freeport area by {{the day after the}} storm, and had power {{restored to}} most of the western portion of the island within three weeks after the hurricane. Work crews quickly removed road debris and tree limbs, and by the day after the passage of Wilma most roads were cleared. The passage of the hurricane left 1,000–4,000people and hundreds of animals homeless. In response, the Grand Bahama Humane Society distributed about 340kg (750lb) of dog food and treated or euthanized injured animals, depending on their condition. The earlier effects of Wilma on Mexico left many tourist areas in that country closed, leading to a 10% increase in tourism in the Bahamas in December 2005. By <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> after the hurricane, the airport on Grand Bahama Island was reopened, and all but one resort were also reopened; the remaining resort was reopened about two months after the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Male blue {{wildebeest}} become {{sexually mature}} at {{about two years}} of age while females can conceive at sixteen months if adequately nourished. Nevertheless, most females do not start to breed until a year later. The mating season, which lasts for <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks,</b> coincides {{with the end of}} the rainy season. This means that the animals are in good condition, having been feeding on highly nutritious new grass growth, and the conception rate is often as high as 95%. The mating season, or rut, typically begins on the night of a full moon, suggesting that the lunar cycle influences breeding. At this time, testosterone production peaks in males, resulting in increased calling and territorial behaviour. The activities of these sexually excited males may also stimulate female to come into estrus.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day that Typhoon Pongsona struck Guam, President George W. Bush {{declared}} the island a major disaster area. Around the time of the cyclone passing over the island, 2,271residents were in shelters, and by the next day it increased to 3,467 after people discovered their homes were uninhabitable. With thirteen Red Cross shelters across Guam, most remained in shelters for <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> before disaster tents were distributed. The American Red Cross worked with the United States Department of Agriculture to provide meals for shelter attendees for a two-week period following the typhoon. Through the collaboration of federal and other agencies, disaster assistance on Guam totaled over $300million (2003USD, $335million 2007USD) by 100days after the typhoon struck, including $60million (2002USD, $ USD) in initial disaster response. Nearly 29,000individuals registered for disaster assistance, with the first assistance check arrived ten days after the disaster declaration. By three months after the storm, the United States Small Business Administration approved $130million (2003USD, $ USD) in low-interest loans.|$|E

5|$|The {{black-necked grebe}} uses {{multiple}} foraging techniques. Insects, {{which make up}} the majority of this bird's diet, are caught either {{on the surface of the}} water or when they are in flight. It occasionally practices foliage gleaning. This grebe dives to catch crustaceans, molluscs, tadpoles, and small frogs and fish. When moulting at saline lakes, this bird feeds mostly on brine shrimp. The black-necked grebe makes a floating cup nest on an open lake. The nest cup is covered with a disc. This nest is located both in colonies and by itself. During the breeding season, which varies depending on location, this species will lay one (sometimes two) clutch of three to four eggs. The number of eggs is sometimes larger due to conspecific brood parasitism. After a 21-day incubation period, the eggs hatch, and then the nest is deserted. After about 10 days, the parents split up the chicks between themselves. After this, the chicks become independent in about 10 days, and fledge in <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|E
5|$|In May 1992, {{intensive}} shelling and infantry {{attacks on}} Bosniak {{areas in the}} municipality caused the Bosniak survivors to flee their homes. The majority of them surrendered or were captured by Serb forces. As the Serb forces rounded up the Bosniak and Croat residents, they forced them to march in columns bound for {{one or another of}} the prison camps that the Serb authorities had established in the municipality. On about 25 May 1992, <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> after the Serbs took control of the municipal government, and two days after the start of large scale military attacks on Bosniak population centers, Serb forces began taking prisoners to the Omarska camp. During the next several weeks, the Serbs continued to round up Bosniaks and Croats from Kozarac near Prijedor, and other places in the municipality and send them to the camps. Many Bosniak and Croat intellectuals and politicians were sent to Omarska. While virtually all of the prisoners were male, there were also 37 women detained in the camp, who served food and cleaned the walls of the torture rooms, and were repeatedly raped in the canteen; bodies of five of them have been exhumed.|$|E
5|$|The eggs hatch after <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> and {{the young}} are {{attended}} by both parents. Males are present around the nest {{for most of the}} day, and females most of the night. The parents exchange nest duties in the morning and in the evening. Most of the feeding of the chicks occurs during the period where they swap nesting duties. Little feeding is done in the period of the day that is between the two duty swaps and no feeding is done between midnight and 6a.m. Chick mortality is highest in the first twenty days post hatching, with anywhere from 37 to 83% of hatchlings surviving to three weeks of age in the Everglades. During periods of food limitations and starvation events, the American white ibis tends to exhibit sex-dependent pre-fledgling mortality. For many bird species that have sexually dimorphic nestlings, mortality rates are higher for larger-sized male nestlings {{as a result of the}} parents' inability to meet its greater nutritional needs. However, in the case of the American white ibis, the male nestlings actually have a lower mortality rate as compared to the females despite being on average 15% greater in mass as compared to its female counterparts. Although current research has yet to discover the underlying factors to why the males tend to have better survival rates under such conditions, it is suspected that the parents tend to feed the larger male nestlings first because they are either perceived by the parents to have a higher chance of survival, or, being generally larger, the male nestlings simply out-compete the small females for food.|$|E
