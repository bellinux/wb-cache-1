25|$|On {{attempted}} <b>adduction</b> with eye depression, the eyelid retracts.|$|E
25|$|Less marked {{limitation}} of <b>adduction</b> (inward movement) {{of the same}} eye.|$|E
25|$|Retraction of the eyeball {{into the}} socket on <b>adduction,</b> with {{associated}} narrowing of the palpebral fissure (eye closing).|$|E
25|$|<b>Adduction</b> {{is carried}} out by the adductor; {{abduction}} mainly by the abductor pollicis longus and brevis, assisted by the extensors.|$|E
25|$|Morad et al. showed {{improved}} abduction after modest unilateral medial rectus {{recession and}} lateral rectus resection in a subgroup {{of patients with}} mild eye retraction and good <b>adduction</b> before surgery.|$|E
25|$|In this {{articulation}} {{the movements}} permitted are {{flexion and extension}} in {{the plane of the}} palm of the hand, abduction and <b>adduction</b> in a plane at right angles to the palm, circumduction, and opposition.|$|E
25|$|This is an {{interaction}} between the abducens nerve and {{a branch of the}} oculomotor nerve. Voluntary activation of the abducens nerve (eye abduction) causes involuntary activation of the oculomotor nerve (eye <b>adduction</b> and eyelid elevation).|$|E
25|$|The opponens pollicis {{originates}} on the tubercle of the trapezium and the flexor retinaculum. It {{is inserted}} onto the radial {{side of the}} first metacarpal. It opposes the thumb and assists in <b>adduction.</b> It is innervated by the median nerve.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{examination}} of the shoulder to feel for injury and discover the limits of movement, location of pain, and extent of joint instability. The steps to elicit this information are inspection (looking), palpation (feeling), testing range of motion, and performing special maneuvers. Information collected on inspection are asymmetry, atrophy, ecchymosis, scars, swelling, and venous distention. Palpation can help find pain and deformities, and should specifically include the anterior glenohumeral joint, acromioclavicular joint, biceps tendon, cervical spine, coracoid process, scapula, and sternoclavicular joint. Range of motion tests external and internal rotation, abduction and <b>adduction,</b> passive and active weakness, and true weakness versus weakness due to pain. The Apley scratch test is the most useful: touch opposite scapular by reaching behind the head for <b>adduction</b> and external rotation and behind the back for abduction and internal rotation. Finally, there are more specific maneuvers that can hone in on a diagnosis, however their accuracy is limited.|$|E
25|$|Some hip muscles also act {{on either}} the knee joint or on {{vertebral}} joints. Additionally, because the area of origin and insertion {{of many of these}} muscles are very extensive, these muscles are often involved in several very different movements. In the hip joint, lateral and medial rotation occur along the axis of the limb; extension (also called dorsiflexion or retroversion) and flexion (anteflexion or anteversion) occur along a transverse axis; and abduction and <b>adduction</b> occur about a sagittal axis.|$|E
25|$|The psoas major {{joins the}} upper body and the lower body, the axial to the appendicular skeleton, the inside to the outside, and the back to the front. As part of the iliopsoas, psoas major {{contributes}} to flexion in the hip joint. On the lumbar spine, unilateral contraction bends the trunk laterally, while bilateral contraction raises the trunk from its supine position. In addition, attachment to the lesser trochanter, located on the postero-medial aspect of the femur, causes lateral rotation and weak <b>adduction</b> of the hip.|$|E
25|$|The hypohydrotic {{symptoms}} of ectodermal dysplasia described above are evidenced {{not only in}} the skin of affected individuals, but also in their phonation and voice production. Because the vocal folds may not be as hydrated as is necessary during the <b>adduction</b> phase of vocal fold vibration (due to lack of lubrication), a complete seal may not be accomplished between the folds and mucosal wave movement may be disrupted. This results in air escapement between the folds and the production of breathy voice, which often accompanies the skin abnormalities of ectodermal dysplasia.|$|E
25|$|In children, {{assessment}} of infantile reflexes {{is also a}} diagnostic tool, such as the Moro reflex and the Romberg Test. The Moro reflex is rarely present in infants after 6 months of age and is characterized {{as a response to}} a sudden loss of support that causes the infant to feel like it is falling. The infant will respond by abduction and <b>adduction</b> (or spreading and unspreading) of the arms, as well as crying. The Moro reflex is significant in evaluating the integration of the central nervous system and patients with ataxic cerebral palsy will show a persistence and exacerbation of the reflex. In addition, patients with ataxic cerebral palsy will rarely show a positive Romberg test, which indicates that there is localized cerebellar dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|Shoulder (Glenohumeral joint) (shoulder) â€“ Several weaker {{functions}} {{occur at}} the glenohumeral, or shoulder, joint. The biceps brachii weakly assists in forward flexion of the shoulder joint (bringing the arm forward and upwards). It may also contribute to abduction (bringing the arm out to the side) when the arm is externally (or laterally) rotated. The short head of the biceps brachii also assists with horizontal <b>adduction</b> (bringing the arm across the body) when the arm is internally (or medially) rotated. Finally, the short head of the biceps brachii, due to its attachment to the scapula (or shoulder blade), assists with stabilization of the shoulder joint when a heavy weight is carried in the arm. The tendon of the long head of the biceps also assists in holding {{the head of the}} humerus in the glenoid cavity.|$|E
500|$|... {{refers to}} a motion that pulls a {{structure}} or part toward the midline of the body, or towards the midline of a limb. In the case of fingers and toes, it refers to bringing the digits together, towards the centerline of the hand or foot. <b>Adduction</b> of the wrist is also called ulnar deviation. Dropping the arms to the sides, and bringing the knees together, are examples of <b>adduction.</b>|$|E
500|$|Abduction is {{the motion}} of a {{structure}} away from the midline while <b>adduction</b> refer to motion towards {{the centre of the}} body. The centre of the body is defined as the midsagittal plane. These terms come from [...] Latin words with similar meanings.|$|E
500|$|... {{refers to}} a conical {{movement}} of a body part, such as a {{ball and socket joint}} or the eye. Circumduction is a combination of flexion, extension, <b>adduction</b> and abduction. Circumduction can be best performed at ball and socket joints, such as the hip and shoulder, but may also be performed by {{other parts of the body}} such as fingers, hands, feet, and head. For example, circumduction occurs when spinning the arm when performing a serve in tennis or bowling a cricket ball.|$|E
500|$|As two {{series of}} {{inscriptions}} on {{the foundations of}} the monumental podium attest, construction of the sanctuary's podium did not begin until the reign of King Bodashtart. The first set of inscriptions bears the name of Bodashtart alone, while the second contains his name and that of the crown prince Yatan-milk. A Phoenician inscription, located [...] upstream from the temple, that dates to the 14th year of Bodashtart's reign, alludes to water <b>adduction</b> works from the Awali river to the [...] "Ydll" [...] source that was used for ritual purification at the temple.|$|E

2500|$|... and [...] {{refers to}} a motion that pulls a {{structure}} away from (abduction) or towards (<b>adduction)</b> the midline of the body or limb. For example, a star jump requires the legs to be abducted.|$|E
2500|$|Posterior oblique {{ligament}} (POL): An intracapsular ligament {{stretching from}} the dorsoulnar side of the trapezium to the ulno-palmar tubercle of the first metacarpal. [...] Not considered an important ligament to the first CMC joint, it tightens during forced <b>adduction</b> and radial abduction.|$|E
2500|$|The {{inferior}} {{parts of}} latissimus dorsi, {{one of the}} muscles of the upper limb, arises from the posterior third of the iliac crest. Its action on the shoulder joint are internal rotation, <b>adduction,</b> and retroversion. [...] It also contributes to respiration (i.e. coughing). [...] When the arm is adducted, latissimus dorsi can pull it backward and medially until the back of the hand covers the buttocks.|$|E
2500|$|For ease of orientation, the {{thumbnail}} can {{be considered}} as resting in the thumb's frontal plane. [...] Abduction and <b>adduction</b> of the first CMC (and MP) joint(s) occur in this plane; flexion and extension of the first CMC, MP, and IP joints occur in a plane that is perpendicular to the thumbnail. [...] This remains true regardless of how the first metacarpal bone is being rotated during opposition and reposition.|$|E
2500|$|The thumb's MP and CMC joints abduct and adduct {{in a plane}} {{perpendicular}} to the palm, a movement {{also referred to as}} [...] "palmar abduction." [...] The same joints flex and extend in a plane parallel to the palm, also referred to as [...] "radial abduction," [...] because the thumb moves toward the hand's radial side. [...] Abduction and <b>adduction</b> occur around an antero-posterior axis, while flexion and extension occur around a lateral axis.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{clinical}} setting, the principal difficulties in differential diagnosis arise {{as a consequence}} of the very early age at which patients with this condition first present. The clinician must be persistent in examining abduction and <b>adduction,</b> and in looking for any associated palpebral fissure changes or head postures, when attempting to determine whether what often presents as a common childhood squint (note-"squint" [...] is a British term for two eyes not looking in the same direction) is in fact Duane syndrome. Fissure changes, and the other associated characteristics of Duane's such as up or down shoots and globe retraction, are also vital when deciding whether any abduction limitation is the result of Duane's and not a consequence of VI or abducens cranial nerve palsy.|$|E
2500|$|The hip joint, an enarthrodial joint, can be {{described}} as a ball and socket joint. The femur connects at the acetabulum of the pelvis and projects laterally before angling medially and inferiorly to form the knee. Although this joint has three degrees of freedom, it is still stable due to the interaction of ligaments and cartilage. The labrum lines the circumference of the acetabulum to provide stability and shock absorption. Articular cartilage covers the concave area of acetabulum, providing more stability and shock absorption. [...] Surrounding the entire joint itself is a capsule secured by the tendon of the psoas muscle and three ligaments. The iliofemoral, or Y, ligament is located anteriorly and serves to prevent hip hyperextension. The pubofemoral ligament is located anteriorly just underneath the iliofemoral ligament and serves primarily to resist abduction, extension, and some external rotation. Finally the ischiofemoral ligament on the posterior side of the capsule resists extension, <b>adduction,</b> and internal rotation. When considering the biomechanics of hip fractures, it is important to examine the mechanical loads the hip experiences during low energy falls.|$|E
2500|$|Diagnosis {{can usually}} be made by {{palpation}} or by feeling the joint and surrounding tissues, although there is controversy {{as to whether or}} not the degree of subluxation can be measured clinically. [...] If shoulder subluxation occurs, it can become a barrier to the rehabilitation process. [...] Treatment involves measures to support the subluxed joint such as taping the joint, using a lapboard or armboard. [...] A shoulder sling may be used, but is controversial and a few studies have shown no appreciable difference in range-of-motion, degree of subluxation, or pain when using a sling. A sling may also contribute to contractures and increased flexor tone if used for extended periods of time as it places the arm close to the body in <b>adduction,</b> internal rotation and elbow flexion. Use of a sling can also contribute to learned nonuse by preventing the functional and spontaneous use of the affected upper extremity. That said, a sling may be necessary for some therapy activities. Slings may be considered appropriate during therapy for initial transfer and gait training, but overall use should be limited. As the patient begins to recover, spasticity and voluntary movement of the shoulder will occur as well as reduction in the shoulder subluxation. Slings are of no value at this point.|$|E
2500|$|Piriformis {{syndrome}} {{occurs when}} the sciatic nerve is compressed or pinched by the piriformis muscle of the hip. [...] It usually only affects one hip at a given time, though both hips may produce piriformis syndrome {{at some point in}} the patient's lifetime, and having had it once greatly increases the chance that it will recur in one hip or the other at some future point unless action is taken to prevent this. Indications include sciatica (radiating pain in the buttock, posterior thigh and lower leg) and the physical exam finding of tenderness in the area of the sciatic notch. If the piriformis muscle can be located beneath the other gluteal muscles, it will feel noticeably cord-like and will be painful to compress or massage. [...] The pain is exacerbated with any activity that causes flexion of the hip including lifting, prolonged sitting, or walking. The diagnosis is largely clinical and is one of exclusion. During a physical examination, attempts may be made to stretch the irritated piriformis and provoke sciatic nerve compression, such as the Freiberg test, the Pace test, the FABER test (flexion, abduction, external rotation), and the FAIR test (flexion, <b>adduction,</b> internal rotation). Conditions to be ruled out include herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP), facet arthropathy, spinal stenosis, and lumbar muscle strain.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, what {{a delicious}} breeze is blowing, {{out here in}} the country!" [...] she said. [...] "Will you excuse me if I take off my gloves? I want to air my hands." [...] She held up her hands to the breeze; firm, muscular, deadly white hands. [...] "In my {{professional}} occupation," [...] she explained, [...] "I am always rubbing, tickling, squeezing, tapping, kneading, rolling, striking the muscles of patients. Selina, do you know the movements of your own joints? Flexion, extension, abduction, <b>adduction,</b> rotation, circumduction, pronation, supination, and the lateral movements. Be proud of those accomplishments, my dear, but beware of attempting to become a Masseuse. There are drawbacks in that vocation--and I am conscious of one of them at this moment." [...] She lifted her hands to her nose. [...] "Pah! my hands smell of other people's flesh. The delicious country air will blow it away--the luxury of purification!" [...] Her fingers twisted and quivered, and got crooked at one moment and straight again at another, and showed themselves in succession singly, and flew into each other fiercely interlaced, and then spread out again like the sticks of a fan, until it really made me giddy to look at them. As for Miss Jillgall, she lifted her poor little sunken eyes rapturously to the sky, as if she called the homiest sunlight to witness that this was the most lovable woman {{on the face of the}} earth.|$|E
50|$|The {{movements}} which {{occur in}} these joints are flexion, extension, <b>adduction,</b> abduction, and circumduction; {{the movements of}} abduction and <b>adduction</b> are very limited, and cannot be performed while the fingers form a fist.|$|E
50|$|Arytenoid <b>adduction</b> is more {{technically}} challenging {{than either}} vocal cord injection or medialization thyroplasty {{and has a}} high learning curve. Increased incidence of complications have been reported for arytenoid <b>adduction</b> compared to medialization thyroplasty.|$|E

50|$|Options for {{surgical}} treatment of vocal cord paralysis include vocal cord injection, medialization thyroplasty, and arytenoid <b>adduction.</b> Each {{of these techniques}} results in medialization of the paralyzed vocal cord. However, arytenoid <b>adduction</b> is preferred in cases {{where there is a}} large posterior glottal gap or vertical misalignment between the vocal folds. Arytenoid <b>adduction</b> is often performed {{at the same time as}} a medialization thyroplasty. Animal model studies suggest that combining the two procedures produces better outcomes than when performing either alone.|$|E
