40|$|Many {{foraging}} animals {{return to}} feeding sites to harvest replenishing resources, but {{little is known}} about efficient tactics for doing this. Can animals with adequate cognitive abilities increase their efficiency by modifying their behavior according to memories of past experience at particular sites? We developed a simulation model of animals harvesting renewable resources from isolated patches in undefended, competitive situations. We compared four foraging tactics: (1) moving stochastically without using any information from past experiences (random searching); (2) moving stochastically, but going longer distances after encountering lower reward (area-restricted searching); (3) repeatedly moving along a fixed route (complete traplining); and (4) traplining, but sampling and shifting to neighboring rewarding patches after encountering low reward (sample-and-shift traplining). Following Possingham, we tracked both the resources <b>actually</b> <b>harvested</b> by a focal forager (i. e., rewards) and the standing crops of resources that accumulated at patches. Complete traplining always produces less variation in elapsed time between visits than random searching or area-restricted searching, which has three benefits: increasing the reward crop harvested, if resource renews nonlinearly; reducing resource standing crop in patches; and reducing variation in reward crop per patch. Moreover, the systematic revisitation schedule produced by complete traplining makes it more competitive, regardless of resource renewal schedule or competitor frequency. By responding to their past experiences, using sample-and-shift traplining, foragers benefit only when many patches are left unvisited in the habitat. Otherwise, the exploratory component of sample-and-shift traplining, which increases the movement distance and the variation in elapsed time between visits, make...|$|E

Crop yield forecasting is an important tool for food security planning as it allows decision makers to make decisions related to pricing, export/import, distribution etc., which helps avoid a situation of food insecurity. Reliable crop yield forecasting becomes {{all the more important}} in the context of climate change since climate change exacerbates the unpredictability of crop yields for a given season. In Nepal, crop yield estimation typically took a more traditional approach combining sample crop cutting data with field surveys, and field verification reports from the District Agricultural Development Offices (DADOs). Based on the information gathered through these processes, and additional field verifications and consultations, the Ministry of Agricultural Development (MoAD), World Food Programme (WFP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) releases crop situation updates twice a year, after the summer and winter harvests. While this process has its advantages, it is time consuming and costly.

40|$|To provide {{advice to}} {{fisheries}} managers, scientists study both commercially valuable species and species of ecological importance {{in order to}} learn their habits, biology, population dynamics, and ecological role. This data is then processed and interpreted and passed onto managers who use this information to establish yearly catch limits for commercial species. Historically, the large scale commercial fisheries in Newfoundland and Labrador have been based on species that have exhibited high abundance and low biomass. However, as the numbers of commercially valuable fish species continue to decline, harvesters are turning to species that are less abundant and of less commercial value in order to maximise the value of their annual income. In this context, less economic value would be a result of a low price per weight of species harvested, or a high price per weight, but low numbers of species <b>actually</b> <b>harvested.</b> In Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) employs highly skilled and well educated scientists to study the biomass and abundance or formally abundant commercially valuable fishery species, but very few of these researchers are familiar with many of the less commercially valuable species. In {{order to be able to}} set responsible catch limits for these newly harvested species, the DFO must either hire more biologists who are familiar with these species, or develop methodologies which will provide them with the scientific data they require to ensure a sustainable harvest. This will require an integrated management approach, where harvesters will have a means to provide DFO with the data required for a sustainable management plan.

40|$|The biomass and {{biofuels}} {{markets have}} increased substantially {{in the last}} two decades, mainly driven by the national and European policy targets on green energy. The same positive trend is registered in particular for wood pellet markets. In comparison with other wooden biofuels (firewood or wood-chips) pellets have a number of positive aspects such as: -	regular and optimized shape; -	wide range of energetic applications (to produce thermal energy, syngas, electricity); -	high solid density resulting in the concentration of a huge amount of energy in small volume; -	high calorific value on volume bases (i. e. : energy density); -	high energetic conversion factors due to the efficiency and regularity of their burning; -	possibility to enhance the qualitative parameters of some biomasses or bio-wastes in a recycling perspective. The supply chains of wood pellets were traditionally based on residues and by-products from the lumber production industry which could be purchased at low cost locally. Even if these raw materials represent the best option, the potential of residual biomasses has now already reached its availability limit and new forms of supply are needed. The research program aims to verify the technical and economical feasibility to develop and improve alternative raw materials supply chains for wood pellet production verifying their qualitative output and environmental performances compared with traditional ones. The research will consider the forestry sector as main source of raw material, as a large amount of low quality timber is annually harvested and even bigger amounts of allowable annual cut (AAC) are not <b>actually</b> <b>harvested</b> both for technical or economic issues. The possibility to build a forest-wood-pellet chain is going to be studied and tested. The project is mainly focus on four pillars: 1) 	The study of the actual quality of commercial pellets in the market. Through a consistent sampling activity and the statistical elaboration of the acquired data via SIMCA modeling it is possible to build a model able to classify each sample and predict its certifiability. The model defines a critical metric distance below which a sample can be considered of certifiable quality. 2) 	The study of the achievable quality that can be technically obtained from forestry assortments. A experimental design is established for the sampling of different raw material retrievable form forest operation in the alpine region. The analysis of wood pellets, produced by the mean of a pilot pelletizing plant, give answers {{about the quality of the}} final product. 3) 	The study of the color of pellets and its relationship with quality parameters. The color of each sample from point 1) is measured through a spectrometer and image scanner and the results elaborated and statistically analyzed to find correlation between color and quality parameter of pellets. 4) 	The impact assessment of different supply and production pellet chains with the LCA methodology. Five supply and production scenarios are studied and discussed from their environmental performance point of view. Each of them is separated into elementary processes involved in the whole chain and their energetic input and emission output studied and analyzed to detect the best option possible compared with reference one. The results of this study show that there are still chances of improvement in the production potential of wood pellets by an optimal organization of the supply, not only of traditional raw materials, but also of innovative ones. Their exploitation, moreover, can find a proper position in the market of commercial pellets since the quality performance of such products is comparable with traditional ones. ...|$|E
40|$|The cruise is a {{contribution}} to SEAFO resulting from a co-operation between SEAFO, the EAF-Nansen project, and the FAO Deep-sea programme. The aim is to facilitate activities {{in support of the}} efforts by RFMOs to meet objectives in relation to the United Nations General Asssembly (UNGA) resolution 61 / 105 and the associated FAO Guidelines on Bottom Fisheries in the high seas. Furthermore, the southeastern Atlantic ABNJ was selected by the recently initiated GEF-sponsored FAO ABNJ programme (“Common Oceans”) as an area of particular attention, involving the relevant RFMO with competent to regulate bottom fishing in that region is the Southeast Atlantic Fisheries Organization (SEAFO). Despite a shortage of data on the occurrence of ‘vulnerable marine ecosystems’ (VMEs, as defined in the FAO Guidelines), SEAFO has introduced comprehensive measures to protect such ecosystems from significant adverse impacts within the convention area. The convention area consist of agreed limited ‘existing fishing areas’, i. e. areas were fisheries were conducted within a recent reference period, and more extensive ‘new fishing areas’ where this was not the case. Commercial harvesting is essentially restricted to the ‘existing fishing areas’, but further regulated by other measures such as species-specific TACs, gear restrictions and other measures aimed to conserve e. g. sharks. To conduct exploratory fisheries in ‘new fishing areas’ parties need to submit a notification and detailed plan and report to the Organization for approval. SEAFO has furthermore closed 10 subareas of the convention area to all fishing activity, a regulation most recently revised in 2011. Best available bathymetry data were compiled to locate subareas recognised in the FAO guidelines as VME features, essentially primarily seamounts. As fishing is restricted to the upper 2000 m of any feature, a map of areas shallower than 2000 m was the basis of further selection. In SEAFO such areas are seamounts or seamount complexes of various sizes and shapes. The spatial distribution of VME indicators such as corals and sponges (i. e. as given in FAO guidelines) is not well known in SEAFO, but the benthic and pelagic biogeographical patterns have been described. It was therefore decided to close 10 potential fishing areas that represented the range of features and the major biogeographical zones of the region. Some of these were actual fishing areas; others were either not fished or lightly fished. The end result was the set of ten closures with various shapes and sizes, ranging from single seamounts to rather wider areas comprising several seamounts or mid-Atlantic Ridge segments. While SEAFO took significant steps to ensure conservation of VMEs, the shortage of information on the distribution patterns of VME indicators remains unsatisfactory. Some new data were acquired by recent fishing experiments in existing and new fishing areas, and by Spanish-Namibian research activity on the Valdivia Bank. However, even within the relatively restricted actual fishing areas, the documentation remains scattered and limited. Similarly, the Scientific Committee of SEAFO struggles with data shortage on the fish resources <b>actually</b> <b>harvested</b> in the convention area, primarily Patagonian toothfish, pelagic armourhead, alfonsino, deep-sea red crab, and associated bycatch species. Stock assessments are generally highly uncertain and fully dependant on fisheries-generated data, hence conservation measures implemented by SEAFO remain largely precautionary rather than tuned to good estimates of abundances and productivity. Catches currently remain rather limited, i. e. collectively less than 1000 t, but some species are valuable and tend to attract interest from fishing parties that would value not only enhanced opportunities but also management based on more reliable stock assessments. This project thus aims to supplement and extend knowledge and databases on VME indicators as well as fisheries resources and will accordingly conduct targeted investigations in the currently used fishing areas of the convention area, primarily on the Walvis Ridge. In addition, some of the fishing closures will be visited to document presence-absence of VME indicators and describe distribution patterns. New data from these targeted studies will enhance the quality of fish stock assessments and help analyse the appropriateness of VME closures currently implemented solely based on feature characteristics and biogeographical affinity. Main conclusions: VMEs indicators were located in all seamounts prospected but differences in structure and development state were observed. In some seamounts coral rubble, sediment-clogged, mostly dead coral framework and living coral framework were observed from the base to the summit all along the slope. Current system associated to each seamount, depth and probably other depth-dependent environmental factors driven the presence and development of deep-water reefs. Continuous research efforts are needed to increase knowledge about biodiversity and structure. Understanding their dynamics will improve effective management and conservation of this vulnerable ecosystems. FAO, EAF-Nansen project / Deep-sea Norway projec...|$|E

40|$|This thesis explores {{interband}} tunneling in semiconductor heterojunctions where a density-of-states switching mechanism {{can be used}} to sharply modulate {{the junction}} conductance using small applied voltages via alignment and misalignment of the band-edges. Such a mechanism is useful for the pursuit of low-power logic devices as well as nonlinear analog components such as square-law detectors. In the former application, density-of-states switching can potentially allow for transistor subthreshold slopes steeper than the room-temperature thermal limit of 60 mV/decade in a device known as a tunnel field effect transistor (TFET), and in the latter application, it can allow for curvature coefficients greater than the thermal limit of 38. 7 V-¹. However, predictions of stellar performance from simulation studies have not yet been matched experimentally, particularly in the area of TFETs, which have not produced a density-of-states switching device steeper than the thermal limit. To date however, the true steepness obtainable from density-of-states switching (band-edge steepness), and what affects it, remains unknown. This thesis fundamentally studies the band-edge steepness and how it depends on various factors including interfacial crystal defects, inhomogeneity, temperature, and band alignment. Using type-III band alignment epitaxially grown InAs/GaSb heterojunctions, as well as both type-II and type-III band alignment InGaAs/GaAsSb heterojunctions, it is identified that point defects gettered by dislocations at the interface as well as uneven distributions of point defects and composition can lead to both interfacial energy states and nonuiform band-alignment across the tunnel junction that result in poorer band-edge steepness. We identify a variety of techniques to improve the junction interface quality and demonstrate a corresponding improvement in band-edge steepness. We also determine that in our two-terminal devices designed to deconvolute TFET parasitics, the band-edge steepness does not depend on temperature, contrasting strongly with published TFET results and indicating that TFETs designed to utilize density-of-states switching are likely not <b>actually</b> <b>harvesting</b> interband tunneling and are instead dominated by thermally-activated parasitics. Using the various conclusions of our fundamental work as design guidelines, we develop and demonstrate an InGaAs/GaAsSb materials system integrated on an InP platform with a record 76 mV/decade band-edge steepness and 43 V- 1 curvature coefficient near zero-bias. by Ryan Iutzi.

30|$|Assuming that {{harvested}} biomass would {{substitute for}} fossil-intensive products increased {{the value of}} the carbon mitigation metric in stands WS 4 and WS 5. This increase was small in the case of ethanol: only 0.38 units of fossil carbon are avoided for every 1 unit of carbon in ethanol substituting for petroleum fuels (Lippke et al. 2012). In this case, the carbon benefits of product substitution were insufficient to compensate for the loss of carbon during harvest and WS 4 and WS 5 still incurred a “carbon debt”. The magnitude of this debt was less than in the case where no substitution was assumed, however. Comparatively, the use of LLWP in place of fossil-intensive substitutes (steel, concrete, etc.) results in much larger quantities of avoided carbon: 2.1 units for every 1 unit in the biomass itself (Lippke et al. 2012). Because the carbon displacement ratio in this case is greater than 1 : 1 (i.e. the loss of carbon due to harvesting biomass is less than the benefits gained by producing and using LLWP), the carbon mitigation metric <b>actually</b> increased after <b>harvest.</b> In WS 5, the scaled value for this metric increased from 0.31 to 0.96 in the harvest year. In WS 4, where less than half as much biomass was removed, the value increased from 0.21 in the year before harvest to 0.43 after the third harvest was completed.

40|$|Cue: When {{heavy rains}} fall, {{how much water}} goes to waste? Water that pours off roofs, forming muddy streams that flow down the streets, {{eventually}} finding {{their way to a}} drainage ditch or a river, or collecting in pools which slowly evaporate. That rainwater is a resource, one which could be used for drinking, cooking, washing and cleaning, or even to support income generation through crops or livestock production. Roof top rainwater harvesting is one method of ensuring {{that at least some of}} the rain is put to use. Simple systems to channel rain from roofs into storage tanks can be installed at very little cost, and constructed from locally available materials. A storage tank, for example, may just be a clay-lined pit, and a gutter can easily be made from a bamboo pole. Ellen Mangore is a civil engineer who specialises in water resources. She spoke to Busani Bafana, explaining first what the basic ingredients of a roof top rainwater harvesting system are. IN:		?Basically this system consists of ? OUT:		? specialises in groundwater resources. ? DUR?N:	 3 ? 33 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: And that was Busani Bafana reporting from Bulawayo in Zimbabwe. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Mangore	Basically this system consists of three main components, the catchment, the conveyance and the storage. The catchment is mainly a roof which can be corrugated, thatch or asbestos and the conveyance is mainly the down-water pipe, the gutters. And the storage can be a tank; a plastic tank, a steel tank or even store it in a masonry tank underground. Bafana		What is this water used for? Mangore	In a rural set up we normally use it for domestic purposes, which can be cooking, cleaning and agricultural purposes, basically irrigation, livestock watering. Bafana	So if a farmer is using this water to grow crops, what kind of crops would be most suitable? Mangore	Usually orchards and vegetables, because we cannot actually expect to water very large fields with water that is collected off a roof. It is actually used as a supplementary supply, not that we actually depend on water that is harvested from a roof for all our requirements. Bafana	I also want to find out how can we keep this water clean, should a farmer decide to use it for domestic purposes? Mangore	Normally the catchment area or the conveyance system and storage system have to be kept clean, especially towards the fall of the rains. So you need to clean up just before the rains fall and we discard the first water that is collected after the first rains, use it perhaps just for irrigation, not for domestic purposes. Bafana	Is it possible to have this system on a traditional hut or it applies only on a modern type of roof? Mangore	It is possible but the quantity of water is decreased. Bafana	How can then this system be adapted using locally available materials? Mangore	For conveyance, we can use bamboo or animal skin and actually you can store the water in masonry tanks which are brick and mortar tanks built underground. Bafana	If, say, in a rural setting you do not have mortar, what can you use? Mangore	You can actually dig small ponds in a nearby area, and then you line it with clay, which is a material which is locally available most of the time. Bafana	Are there any ways that this system can be improved on, maybe so that a farmer can collect more water or have a greater storage capacity? Mangore	This system can be improved on by? you decrease seepage into the ground if you use ponds, by using an appropriate method for lining. Bafana	Are there any other simple small-scale storm water harvesting techniques that farmers can use when they cannot afford gutters? Mangore	Farmers can <b>actually</b> <b>harvest</b> water from the courtyard where, by virtue of the compaction of people moving around the home, then that ground is compacted, then it can act as a catchment area and it drains perhaps into a hand dug pond somewhere near the homestead. Bafana	From your research in the techniques of storm water harvesting, what lessons would you say have been learnt using the rooftop technique? Mangore	The rooftop technique is actually simple and low cost and it does not require much skill, so it is applicable almost everywhere this type of roof exists. Bafana	Which time is it most cost effective to install this system? Mangore	This system should be installed as part of a house when it is designed. As we decide to build a house we should bear in mind, because of the region in which you are building ? if this is a dry region or one where the rainfall is very seasonal then we have to consider this as part of the design of our house.

40|$|Understanding the {{processes}} generating fluctuations of natural populations {{lies at the}} very heart of academic ecology. It is also very important for applications such as fisheries management and pest control. We are interested in the effect of harvesting on population fluctuations and for that purpose we develop and analyze an age-structured model where recruitment is a stochastic process and the adult segment of the population is harvested. When a constant annual harvest is taken the coefficient of variation of the adult population increases for most parameter values due to the age truncation effect, i. e. an increased variability in a juvenescent population due to the removal of older individuals. However, if a constant proportion of the adults is harvested the age truncation effect is sometimes counteracted by a stabilizing dynamic effect of harvesting. Depending on parameter values mirroring different life histories, proportional harvest can either increase or decrease the relative fluctuations of an exploited population. When there is a demographic Allee effect the ratio of juveniles to adults may <b>actually</b> decrease with <b>harvesting.</b> We conclude that, depending on life history and harvest strategy, harvesting can either reinforce or dampen population fluctuations due to the relative importance of stabilizing dynamic effects and the age truncation effect. The strength of the latter is highly dependent on the fished population's endogenous, age-structured dynamics. More specifically, we predict that populations with strong and positively autocorrelated dynamics will show stronger age truncation effect, a testable prediction that offers a simple rule-of-thumb assessment of a population's vulnerability to exploitation.
