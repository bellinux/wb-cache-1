50|$|A load-sharing (or load-distributing) <b>anchor</b> is <b>a</b> system {{consisting}} {{of two or more}} individual anchors which join together at <b>a</b> main <b>anchor</b> point to form <b>an</b> <b>anchoring</b> system. This configuration is a way to introduce redundancy and increase strength, typically for <b>a</b> belay <b>anchor.</b> If assembled correctly, the load will be distributed to each individual anchor, rather than placing all the load on <b>a</b> single <b>anchor</b> point. This decreases the chance that any single anchor point will fail, and, if a point does fail, the other(s) should still be able to hold.|$|R
