The annual Cher's Family Retreat is held each June to provide craniofacial patients, their siblings and parents an opportunity to interact with others who have endured similar experiences. She supports and promotes Get <b>A-Head</b> Charitable Trust, which aims {{to improve the quality}} of life for people with head and neck diseases.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{shot him}} down, sir,' pursued Chollop, 'for asserting in the Spartan Portico, a tri-weekly journal, that the ancient Athenians went <b>a-head</b> {{of the present}} Locofoco Ticket.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, my lad, it ain't {{the right}} point o' the compass {{by a long}} way," [...] said the Captain; [...] "but yonder goes a strange sail <b>a-head,</b> let's {{overhaul}} her." ...|$|E
5000|$|Some {{call the}} Roman numerals [...] "A-heads" [...] (for [...] "A-level headings"), the upper-case letters, [...] "B-heads", and so on. Some writers also prefer to insert a blank {{line between the}} <b>A-heads</b> and B-heads, while often keeping the B-heads and C-heads together.|$|R
5000|$|The Wessex '82 7" [...] is a split EP release by UK punk bands The Subhumans, The Pagans, Organised Chaos and The <b>A-Heads.</b> Each band {{contributes}} one {{track to}} the record. This {{was also the}} first vinyl release on the Subhuman's own label, Bluurg Records.|$|R
5000|$|Subhumans {{released}} {{two more}} EPs in 1982, Reasons for Existence and Religious Wars, {{as well as}} founding their own record label, Bluurg Records. Although initially focused on releasing cassette recordings, the label produced its first vinyl release with the [...] "Wessex '82" [...] EP, which featured one track each by the Subhumans ("No Thanks"), The Pagans, Organised Chaos and The <b>A-Heads.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Heave <b>a-head</b> then, Captain," [...] said Lewis, [...] "and clap on stun's'ls and sky-scrapers, for {{the strange}} sail is making for that cottage on the hill, {{and will get}} into port before we {{overhaul}} her if we don't look sharp." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're a smart boy, Billy. Now do as I tell 'ee, {{and keep}} your weather eye open. D'ye see that bit o' {{floating}} wreck <b>a-head?</b> Well, keep straight for that and run right against it. I'll trust to 'ee, boy, that ye don't miss it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well; now {{you have}} been {{explicit}} with a vengeance, and you may heave <b>a-head.</b> Let's hear the story, and if I can help you I will. When I've said that, you may be sure I mean it. I've heard something of it before; but let me hear it all from you." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{table of}} {{contents}} usually includes the titles or descriptions of the first-level headers, such as chapter titles in longer works, and often includes second-level or section titles (<b>A-heads)</b> within the chapters as well, and occasionally even third-level titles (subsections or B-heads). The depth of detail in tables of contents depends {{on the length of}} the work, with longer works having less. Formal reports (ten or more pages and being too long to put into a memo or letter) also have a {{table of contents}}. Within an English-language book, the table of contents usually appears after the title page, copyright notices, and, in technical journals, the abstract; and before any lists of tables or figures, the foreword, and the preface.|$|R
60|$|With those prongs of hair {{sticking}} {{up all over}} his head, and his breath coming and going very hard and short, the busy Pancks fell back a step (in Tug metaphor, took half a turn astern) as if to show his dingy hull complete, then forged <b>a-head</b> again, and directed his quick glance by turns into his hat where his note-book was, and into Clennam's face.|$|E
6000|$|But {{the letter}} proves too much again. For Parker says that 'Witney and Woolaston are gone off <b>a-head</b> {{to look for}} homeward-bound men,' thus agreeing with Raleigh's message to his wife, that 'Witney, for whom I sold all my plate at Plymouth, and to whom I gave more credit and countenance than to all the captains of my fleet, ran from me at the Grenadas, and Woolaston with him.' ...|$|E
60|$|Ere any answer {{could be}} made, or any measure taken in {{consequence}} of the corporal's motion, a dragoon galloped towards Sergeant Bothwell, who was considerably <b>a-head</b> of the party he commanded. On hearing the orders which he brought, Bothwell instantly rode back {{to the head of}} his party, ordered them to close their files, to mend their pace, and to move with silence and precaution, as they would soon be in presence of the enemy.|$|E
6000|$|As this gondola {{attended}} {{their progress}} in various artful ways; sometimes shooting on <b>a-head,</b> and stopping {{to let them}} pass; sometimes, when the way was broad enough, skimming along {{side by side with}} them; and sometimes following close astern; and as Fanny gradually made no disguise that she was playing off graces upon somebody within it, of whom she at the same time feigned to be unconscious; Little Dorrit at length asked who it was? ...|$|E
60|$|The biggest Ship, {{which was}} three Leagues a-Stern of the other, crowded {{in for the}} Shore with all the Sail, she could make, and {{it was easy for}} us to see that she would escape us; for as she was a great deal farther in with the Land than the other when we first gave Chace, so in about three Hours we saw the Land plain <b>a-Head</b> of us, and that the great Ship would get into Port before we could reach her.|$|E
6000|$|Dined at {{a dinner}} given by the Antiquarian Society to Mr. Hay Drummond, Secretary to the Society, now going Consul to Tangiers. It was an {{excellent}} dinner--turtle, champagne, and all the agrémens of a capital meal, for £1, 6s. <b>a-head.</b> How Barry managed I can't say. The object of this compliment spoke and drank wine incessantly; good-naturedly delighted with the compliment, which he repeatedly assured me he valued {{more than a hundred}} pounds. I take it that after my departure, which was early, it would be necessary to [...] "carry Mr. Silence to bed."[321] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have a fine}} {{moonlight}} {{night for}} riding on," [...] says Esmond; [...] "Frank, we may reach Castlewood in time yet." [...] All the way along they made inquiries at the post-houses, when a tall young gentleman in a gray suit, with a light brown periwig, just {{the color of my}} lord's, had been seen to pass. He had set off at six that morning, and we at three in the afternoon. He rode almost as quickly as we had done; he was seven hours <b>a-head</b> of us still when we reached the last stage.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Mr. Carstone," [...] said Mrs. Badger, [...] "is {{very well}} and is, I assure you, a great {{acquisition}} to our society. Captain Swosser used to say of me that I was always better than land <b>a-head</b> and a breeze a-starn to the midshipmen's mess when the purser's junk had become as tough as the fore-topsel weather earings. It was his naval way of mentioning generally that I was an acquisition to any society. I may render the same tribute, I am sure, to Mr. Carstone. But I--you won't think me premature if I mention it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will illustrate, Frank, The needy {{man is a}} train {{slipped off}} the rail. He who loans him money on {{interest}} is the one who, by way of accommodation, helps get the train back where it belongs; but then, by way of making all square, and a little more, telegraphs to an agent, thirty miles <b>a-head</b> by a precipice, to throw just there, on his account, a beam across the track. Your needy man's principle-and-interest friend is, I say again, a friend with an enmity in reserve. No, no, my dear friend, no interest for me. I scorn interest." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{revenues}} of the poor-house, {{as it is}} now established, amount to about two thousand pounds a-year; whereof two hundred allowed for officers, and one hundred for repairs, the remaining seventeen hundred, at four pounds <b>a-head,</b> will support four hundred and twenty-five persons. This is a favourable allowance, considering that I subtract nothing for the diet of those officers, and for wear and tear of furniture; and if every one of these collegiates should be set to work, it is agreed {{they will not be able}} to gain by their labour above one-fourth part of their maintenance.|$|E
6000|$|... "How now, knave?" [...] {{said the}} knight; [...] "thou art too well trained, surely, {{to take up}} the chase without orders." [...] A minute more showed them Phoebe Mayflower approaching, her light pace so little impeded by the burden which she bore, that she joined her master and young {{mistress}} just as they arrived at the keeper's hut, which was the boundary of their journey. Bevis, who had shot <b>a-head</b> to pay his compliments to Sir Henry his master, had returned again to his immediate duty, the escorting Phoebe and her cargo of provisions. The whole party stood presently assembled before the door of the keeper's hut.|$|E
60|$|Upon this we stretch'd <b>a-Head</b> {{with all}} the Sail we could make, and the Sloop, which crowded also very hard, and out-went us, engag'd the small Ship at least an Hour before we could come up: But she could make little of it, for the Spanish Ship having 12 Guns and 6 Patereroes, {{would have been too}} many for the Sloop if we had not come up: However, at length, our biggest Ship came up also, and, running up under her Quarter, gave her our whole Broadside; at which she struck immediately, and the Spaniards cry'd, Quarter, and Miserecordia; Upon this, our Sloop's Men enter'd her presently, and secur'd her.|$|E
60|$|After that, {{there was}} a spread in the dining-room of the most {{magnificent}} kind. Fowls, tongues, preserves, fruits, confectionaries, jellies, neguses, barley-sugar temples, trifles, crackers--eat all you can and pocket what you like--all at Old Cheeseman's expense. After that, speeches, whole holiday, double and treble sets of all manners of things for all manners of games, donkeys, pony-chaises and drive yourself, dinner for all the masters at the Seven Bells (twenty pounds <b>a-head</b> our fellows estimated it at), an annual holiday and feast fixed for that day every year, and another on Old Cheeseman's birthday--Reverend bound down before the fellows to allow it, {{so that he could}} never back out--all at Old Cheeseman's expense.|$|E
60|$|I do not {{say that}} no Germans had crossed the Laybach pass before him. On the contrary, Markmen, Quadi, Vandals, seem to have come over it as early as 180, and {{appeared}} under the walls of Aquileia. Of course, some one must have gone first, or Alaric would not have known of it. There were no maps then, at least among our race. Their great generals had to feel their way foot by foot, trusting to hearsays of old adventurers, deserters, and what not, as to whether a fruitful country or an impassable alp, a great city or the world's end, was twenty miles <b>a-head</b> of them. Yes, they had great generals among them, and Alaric, perhaps, the greatest.|$|E
6000|$|The {{lieutenant}} of the watch, to {{whom the}} order was addressed, complied; and, in another minute, the [...] "Dart" [...] was also beginning to move <b>a-head,</b> though in a direction directly opposite to that taken by the [...] "Dolphin." [...] The old man highly enjoyed his own decision, manifesting his self-satisfaction by the infinite glee and deep chuckling of his manner. He was too much occupied with the step he had just taken, to revert immediately to the subject that had so recently been uppermost in his mind; nor did the thought of pursuing the discourse occur to him, until the two ships had left a broad field of water between them, as each moved, with ease and steadiness, on its proper course.|$|E
60|$|Since {{the trees}} walked forth to choose {{themselves}} a king, never was an honour so bandied about. The parson {{would not leave}} the quiet of his chimney-corner--the bailie pleaded the dignity of his situation, and {{the approach of the}} great annual fair, as reasons against going to Edinburgh to make arrangements for printing the Benedictine's manuscript. The schoolmaster alone seemed of malleable stuff; and, desirous perhaps of emulating the fame of Jedediah Cleishbotham, evinced a wish to undertake this momentous commission. But a remonstrance from three opulent farmers, whose sons he had at bed, board, and schooling, for twenty pounds per annum <b>a-head,</b> came like a frost over the blossoms of his literary ambition, and he was compelled to decline the service.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{means no}} great things, now, my Lady," [...] {{returned}} Fid, very coolly placing {{himself in the}} same condition as Wilder, by profiting by the liberty of his arms, and loosening his own neck from the halter, notwithstanding a movement made {{by some of the}} people to prevent it, which was, however, staid by a look from their leader's eyes. [...] "I will first cast loose this here rope; seeing that it is neither decent, nor safe, for an ignorant man, like me, to enter into such unknown navigation, <b>a-head</b> of his officer. The collar was just the necklace of the dog, which is here to be seen on the arm of poor Guinea, who was, in most respects, a man for whose equal one might long look in vain." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was full}} twelve o'clock, {{and the last}} rope was being loosed from the moorings. [...] "Ting-ting," [...] went the engine-room bell. [...] "Thud-thud," [...] started the great screw that would not stop again for so many restless hours. The huge vessel shuddered {{throughout}} her frame like an awakening sleeper, and growing quick with life, forged {{an inch or two}} <b>a-head.</b> Next, a quartermaster, came with two men to hoist up the gangway, when suddenly a boat shot alongside and hooked on, amongst the occupants of which Arthur had no difficulty in recognizing Mrs. Carr, who sat laughing, like Pleasure, at the helm. The other occupants of the boat, who were not laughing, he guessed to be her servants and the lady who figured on the passenger-list as Miss Terry, a stout, solemn-looking person in spectacles.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Barker had not officiated {{for many}} months in this capacity, when the {{appearance}} of the first omnibus caused the public mind to go in a new direction, and prevented a great many hackney-coaches from going in any direction at all. The genius of Mr. Barker at once perceived the whole extent of the injury that would be eventually inflicted on cab and coach stands, and, by consequence, on watermen also, by the progress of the system of which the first omnibus was a part. He saw, too, the necessity of adopting some more profitable profession; and his active mind at once perceived how much might be done in the way of enticing the youthful and unwary, and shoving the old and helpless, into the wrong buss, and carrying them off, until, reduced to despair, they ransomed themselves by the payment of sixpence <b>a-head,</b> or, to adopt his own figurative expression in all its native beauty, ‘till they was rig’larly done over, and forked out the stumpy.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|The last {{resource}} is {{to post a}} man at the masthead (if so lofty an expression may be allowed in reference to so little a vessel as the Tomtit), to keep a look-out. Up the rigging swarms Dick the Bilious, in the lowest spirits--strains his eyes over the waters, and suddenly hails the gaping deck with a joyous shout. The runaway islands are caught at last--he sees them <b>a-head</b> of us--he has no objection to make to the course we are steering--nothing particular to say but [...] "Crack on!"--and nothing in the world to do but slide down the rigging again. Contentment beams once more on the faces of Sam, Dick, and Bob. Mr. Migott and I say nothing; but we look at each other with a smile of triumph. We remember the injurious doubts of the crew when the charts were last unrolled--and think of Columbus again, and feel for him more than ever.|$|E
6000|$|The {{order was}} obeyed; {{and then the}} [...] "Dart," [...] feeling the {{powerful}} impulse, quickened her speed like an animated being, that is freshly urged by its apprehensions or its wishes. By this time, she had gained {{a position on the}} weather-quarter of her adversary who had not manifested the smallest desire to prevent her attaining so material an advantage. On the contrary, while the [...] "Dolphin" [...] kept the same canvas spread, she continued to lighten her top-hamper bringing as much of the weight as possible, from the towering height of her tall masts, to the greater security of the hull. Still, the distance between them was too great, in the opinion of Bignall, to commence the contest, while the facility with which his adversary moved <b>a-head</b> threatened to protract the important moment to an unreasonable extent, or to reduce him to a crowd of sail that might prove embarrassing while enveloped in the smoke, and pressed by the urgencies of the combat.|$|E
6000|$|Tyrrel's painting, as Meg called it, went on equally slowly: He often, indeed, {{showed her}} the {{sketches}} which he brought from his walks, and used to finish at home; but Meg held them very cheap. What signified, she said, a wheen bits of paper, wi' black and white scarts upon them, that he ca'd bushes, and trees, and craigs?--Couldna he paint them wi' green, and blue, and yellow, like the other folk? [...] "Ye will never mak your bread that way, Maister Francie. Ye suld munt up a muckle square of canvass, like Dick Tinto, and paint folks ainsells, that they like muckle better to see than ony craig in the haill water; and I wadna muckle objeck even {{to some of the}} Wallers coming up and sitting to ye. They waste their time waur, I wis--and, I warrant, ye might make a guinea <b>a-head</b> of them. Dick made twa, but he was an auld used hand, and folk maun creep before they gang." ...|$|E
60|$|Our freedom {{extends to}} the {{smallest}} details. We have no stated hours, and we are well <b>a-head</b> of all rules and regulations. We have no breakfast hour, no dinner hour, no time for rising or for going to bed. We have no particular eatables at particular meals. We don't know {{the day of the}} month, or the day of the week; and never look at our watches, except when we wind them up. Our voice is frequently the voice of the sluggard; but we never complain, because nobody ever wakes us too soon, or thinks of interfering with our slumbering again. We wear each other's coats, smoke each other's pipes, poach on each other's victuals. We are a happy, dawdling, undisciplined, slovenly lot. We have no principles, no respectability, no business, no stake in the country, no knowledge of Mrs. Grundy. We are a parcel of Lotos-Eaters; and we know nothing, except that we are poking our way along anyhow to the Scilly Islands in the Tomtit.|$|E
6000|$|For so it {{happened}} to Tom likewise. He was very sorely tried; for though, by keeping the dog to heels (or rather to toes, for he had to walk backward), he could see pretty well which way the dog was hunting, yet it was much slower work to go backwards than to go forwards. But, what was more trying still, no sooner had {{he got out of}} Peacepool, than there came running to him all the conjurors, fortune-tellers, astrologers, prophesiers, projectors, prestigiators, as many as were in those parts (and there are too many of them everywhere), Old Mother Shipton on her broomstick, with Merlin, Thomas the Rhymer, Gerbertus, Rabanus Maurus, Nostradamus, Zadkiel, Raphael, Moore, Old Nixon, and a good many in black coats and white ties who might have known better, considering in what century they were born, all bawling and screaming at him, [...] "Look <b>a-head,</b> only look a-head; and we will show you what man never saw before, and right away {{to the end of the}} world!" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{hour for}} the {{expedition}} came, and Amy set off walking with Laura, because Guy was with Mrs. Edmonstone; but presently, after holding open a gate for Charlotte, {{who was on the}} donkey, he came up to the sisters, and joined in the conversation. Amy saw something in the hedge--a foxglove, she believed--it would have done as well {{if it had been a}} nettle--she stopped to gather it, hoping to fall behind them, but they waited for her. She grew silent, but Guy appealed to her. She ran on to Charlotte and her donkey, but at the next gate Guy had joined company again. At last she put herself under her mother's wing, and by keeping with her did pretty well all the time she was at East-hill. But when they went on, she was riding the donkey, and it, as donkeys always are, was resolved on keeping <b>a-head</b> of the walkers, so that as Guy kept by her side, it was a more absolute tete-a-tete than ever.|$|E
60|$|We had not, however, rid here so long, {{but should}} have tided {{it up the}} river, but that the wind blew too fresh; and, after we had lain four or five days, blew very hard. However, the roads being {{reckoned}} {{as good as a}} harbour, the anchorage good, and our ground tackle very strong, our men were unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive of danger, but spent the time in rest and mirth, after the manner of the sea; but the eighth day in the morning the wind increased, and we had all hands at work to strike our top-masts, and make every thing snug and close, that the ship might ride as easy as possible. By noon the sea went very high indeed, and our ship rode forecastle in, shipped several seas, and we thought once or twice our anchor had come home; upon which our master ordered out the sheet anchor; so that we rode with two anchors <b>a-head,</b> and the cables veered out to the better end.|$|E
