40|$|Introduction: Two fish species, {{the greater}} silver smelt Argentina silus and the roundnose {{grenadier}} Coryphaenoides rupestris, are highly abundant in the deep-water areas of the Skagerrak. Since the 1970 s, a small <b>aimed</b> <b>trawl</b> fishery for the smelt has developed and now also some grenadier is landed. The biology and general distribution of both species have been described from the Skagerrak and elsewhere. Due to their benthopelagic distribution at depths from 200 to 700 m, previous attempts at estimating abundance and biomass of the Skagerrak concentrations yielded unsatisfactory results. In April 1992, during what appears as a major spawning season of the {{greater silver smelt}}, abundance estimation by the SIMRAD EK 500 echo sounder and integrator was attempted. Comparisons were made between observations made by the hull-mounted transducer and a transducer mounted in a newly developed towed body...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experiments with}} modified beam <b>trawls</b> <b>aimed</b> at reducing discard rates and direct mortality of benthic in-fauna and epi-fauna without affecting {{the level of}} landings. Drop-out panels made of large meshes {{in the belly of}} the net were effective in reducing by-catch, but the penalty was a loss in landings (particularly sole, plaice, dab). Effective release of heavy invertebrates (quahog, prickly cockle) seems possible. An alternative parabolic tickler chain arrangement did not reduce landings nor by-catch. Parallel chains seemed to offer more potential in reducing by-catch, particularly shellfish, but significant losses in landings also occurred. The configuration used here, with ticklers fitted on the ground rope, caused an increase in direct mortality of benthic invertebrates and is therefore not recommende...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{established}} that increasing mesh number in the circumference of a diamond-mesh trawl codend can reduce size selection for round fish, whereas selection for flat fish species is unaffected. This effect has also been documented in Mediterranean trawl fisheries. In contrast, no information is available {{with regard to the}} effect of increasing mesh number in the circumference of square-mesh codends on the size selection of round fish and flat fish species. A field study was devised to bridge this gap and formulate proposals <b>aimed</b> at improving <b>trawl</b> fishery management. Size selection data were collected for a round fish species, red mullet (Mullus barbatus), and two flat fish species, Mediterranean scaldfish (Arnoglossus laterna) and solenette (Buglossidium luteum). Fishing trials were conducted in the Adriatic Sea (Central Mediterranean) using three square-mesh codends that differed only in mesh number around the circumference. Results demonstrated that increasing the number of meshes from 107 to 213 reduced the 50 % retention length (L 50) for red mullet by 2. 5 cm but did not affect size selection for the two flat fish species. In some fisheries, regulatory provisions regarding the number of meshes in the circumference should therefore be carefully considered both for diamond- and square-mesh codends...|$|R
40|$|For 10 {{years the}} Institute for Fishing Technology, Hamburg (IFH) has been {{carrying}} out {{experiments in the}} brown shrimp fishery with beam <b>trawls</b> <b>aiming</b> at a reduction of unwanted bycatches. When the tests were transferred to commercial fishery conditions the personnel effort and costs increased markedly. It became e. g. necessary to install a deep-freeze chain {{to make it possible}} to evaluate more samples in the laboratory. This again required {{to increase the number of}} technicians for measuring the fish and shrimp samples, but also made it necessary to perform this work in the most rational and time-saving way by applying modern electronic aids. Though all samples still have to be sorted by species and have to be weighed and measured the introduction of electronic aids, however, like electronic measuring board and computer-aided image processing system, all weight and length data are immediately and digitally recorded after processing. They are transferred via a network to a server PC which stores them into a purpose-designed database. This article describes the applicationof two electronic systems: the measuring board (FM 100, Fa. SCANTROL), iniated by a project in the Norwegian Institute for Fishing Technology, and a computer-aided image processing system, focussing on measuring shrimps in their naturally flexed shape, also developed in the Institute for Fishing Technology in close collaboration with the University of Duisburg. These electronic recording systems allow the consistent and reproducible record of data independent of the changing day-to-day personal form of the staff operating them. With the help of these systems the number of measurements the laboratory could be maximized to 250 000 per year. This made it possible to evaluate, in 1999, 525 catch samples from 75 commercial hauls taken during 15 days at sea. The time gain in measuring the samples is about one third of the time previously needed (i. e. one hour per sample). An additional advantage is the immediate availability of the digitally stored data which enables rapid analyses of all finished subexperiments. Both systems are applied today in several institutes of the Federal Research Centre. The image processing system is now the standard measuring method in an international research project...|$|R
40|$|This paper, {{which follows}} part {{one that was}} printed in the {{previous}} number of this bulletin, describes {{the history of the}} trawl fisheries in the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea since the 1970 's. In the 1970 's, the fish production kept at the average of 300 thousand tons despite the boat reduction and limits of the fish resources. However, target species were replaced the fish paste material which other cheaper materials became dominant with fresh fish through the employment of transportation boats. In this period, the oil crisis brought a serious blow resulting in the business falling into the red. In the 1980 's, the number of fisheries radically decreased. The reasons for the degeneration were the over-exploitation causing a decrease in fish resources, strengthening of the fisheries regulation conferred with Korea and China, development of foreign fisheries which limited the Japanese trawl fisheries, lack of crews, and an end of operation in the northern sea as a side job. Then, they tried to construct energy saving boats, trawl fishing with one boat, and a mid water <b>trawl</b> <b>aimed</b> at high-price fish. In the 1990 's, the trawl fisheries had continuously declined in production and in number of boats through several boat reduction programs. As a result of the consultation with both countries and a loser of competitiveness, the fishing grounds became narrow and closer to Japanese waters. The companies hired Chinese crews as a countermeasure of the lack of labor and high labor cost. Also, some companies carried products such as live fish against the stagnant price, in which an increasing import of fresh fish from China and the economic depreciation resulted. In the 2000 's, the trawl fisheries have fallen to the final stage because the production has dropped to 5 thousand tons. This fact implies that the trawl fisheries in the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea have become one of the local fisheries. In addition, the new bilateral fisheries agreements divide the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea to the surrounding countries, but extensive indivisible area remains a competitive fishing area...|$|R
40|$|Tese de dout., Ciências e Tecnologias das Pescas, Faculdade de Ciências do Mar e do Ambiente, Univ. do Algarve, 2003 Scientific {{evidence}} {{points to}} the overfishing {{of some of the}} most important commercial stocks exploited in Portuguese waters (ICES sub-area IXa) by the bottom trawling fleets targeting fish and crustaceans. While temporary fishing interdiction has been implemented in specific areas off the south-west coast, in an attempt to reduce the fishing effort upon juvenile fish, there has been considerable resistance to the introduction of gear modifications, including the increase in cod end mesh sizes. The small cod end mesh sizes currently in use, particularly in crustacean trawling, largely contribute to catch discarding or misreporting, causing increasing conflicts between trawl fishermen and fishermen from other métiers competing for common resources. Recent studies have shown that discard rates can attain very high levels, up to 70 % on board of both crustacean and fish trawlers off the Portuguese south coast, with a high number of low-valued species, especially small pelagics, being discarded in large amounts. A number of gear modifications were tested in crustacean and fish <b>trawls,</b> <b>aiming</b> at reducing the amount of undersized fish from the target species and allowing for the escapement of a significant fraction of non-commercial by-catch. Their usefulness is discussed in a review, six papers and an overview of the thesis. The improvement of size-selectivity, by increasing cod end mesh size and changing mesh configuration was addressed for the deep groundfish assemblage off the south coast exploited by crustacean trawlers (Papers I and II), and for the shallow and deep groundfish assemblages off the south west coast, where a number of fish trawlers usually operate (Papers III and IV). Cod end selectivity parameters for three different mesh sizes and two mesh configurations, diamond and square mesh, were estimated for a large number of target and by-catch species. In a number of cases, the data structure allowed for the analysis of between-haul variation, and selectivity models were proposed which relate the estimated parameters to the variables under test and also to external variables such as cod end catch and trawling depth, giving a first insight into the mechanisms involved in cod end size selectivity. By-catch reducing devices (BRD’s) placed in the rear part of the trawls or in the cod end, comprising different combinations of oblique separator panels in association with square mesh windows, and square mesh windows alone, were tested in crustacean fishing grounds off the south coast (Papers V and VI), with the purpose of excluding the non-commercial by-catch. The effectiveness of the different BRD’s was separately evaluated for the most captured species. Between-species differences in behaviour towards the sorting devices are discussed. Sizedependence in escapement through the square mesh windows was recorded for a number of species, and the window selectivity could then be separately estimated. The cod end selectivity experiments carried out for crustacean trawling suggested that an increase in cod end mesh size from the current 55 mm to 70 mm diamond mesh, without changing cod end design or material, would be advisable in order to reduce the amount of undersized catch. Such an increase would simultaneously allow for the exclusion of a large fraction of non-commercial by-catch. The results obtained for fish trawling provide, on the other hand, evidence of the difficulty in managing a number of target species of different shapes and sizes based only on mesh size or mesh configuration regulations. The use of BRD’s greatly contributed to the exclusion of non-commercial by-catch. While evidence of active escape behaviour through the square mesh windows was found for some by-catch species, for others the exclusion from the trawl relied on previous guidance to upper trawl areas by the separator panels used. Overall, the results suggest a significant potential for the use of by-catch reducing devices in this fishery. Comissão Europeia.
