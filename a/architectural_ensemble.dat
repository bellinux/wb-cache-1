5|$|According to Firishta, Malik Kafur, {{the head}} general of Alauddin Khalji, {{the ruler of}} Delhi Sultanate, reached Rameswaram during his {{political}} campaign in spite of stiff resistance from the Pandyan princes in the early 14th century. He erected a mosque by name Alia al-Din Khaldji in honour of victory of Islam. During the early 15th century, the present day Ramanathapuram, Kamuthi and Rameswaram {{were included in the}} Pandya dynasty. In 1520 CE, the town came under the rule of Vijayanagara Empire. The Sethupathis, the breakaway from Madurai Nayaks, ruled Ramanathapuram and contributed to the Ramanathaswamy temple. The most notable of them are the contributions of Muthu Kumara Ragunatha and Muthu Ramalinga Sethupathi, who transformed the temple to an <b>architectural</b> <b>ensemble.</b> The region was repeatedly captured several times by Chanda Sahib (1740 – 1754 CE), Arcot Nawab and Muhammed Yusuf Khan (1725 – 1764 CE) in the middle of 18th century. In 1795 CE, Rameswaram came under the direct control of the British East India Company and was annexed to the Madras Presidency. After 1947, the town became a part of Independent India.|$|E
5|$|Six of the {{reductions}} were listed {{as part of}} the World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1990. The churches of San Ignacio de Velasco, Santiago de Chiquitos and Santo Corazón have been reconstructed from scratch and {{are not part of the}} World Heritage Site. In San Juan Bautista only ruins remain. UNESCO listed the site under criteria IV and V, acknowledging the adaption of Christian religious architecture to the local environment and the unique architecture expressed in the wooden columns and banisters. Recently ICOMOS, the International Council on Monuments and Sites, warned that the traditional <b>architectural</b> <b>ensemble</b> that makes up the site has become vulnerable following agrarian reforms from 1953 which threatened the fragile socioeconomic infrastructure of the region. At the time of the nomination, the World Heritage Site was protected by the Pro Santa Cruz committee, Cordecruz, Plan Regulador de Santa Cruz, and the local mayoral offices of the mission towns.|$|E

25|$|The {{project plan}} of the Nezalezhnastci Avenue {{ensemble}} is a good example. The layout provided for the main features of the town-planning ensemble – {{the length of the}} buildings facades, their silhouettes, the main divisions, and the general architectural pattern. The integrated building plan was based on the accommodation of innovative ideas with classical architecture. The survived pre-war buildings and park zones were incorporated into the <b>architectural</b> <b>ensemble.</b>|$|E
25|$|The urban <b>architectural</b> <b>ensemble</b> of Nezalezhnastci Avenue in Minsk is {{an example}} of the {{integrated}} approach in organizing a city's environment by harmoniously combining its architectural monuments, the planning structure, the landscape and the natural or man-made places of vegetation. The Ensemble was constructed during the fifteen years after World War II. Its length is 2900 metres. The width of the road including side-walks varies from 42 to 48 metres.|$|E

25|$|The 18th and 19th-century <b>architectural</b> <b>ensemble</b> of {{the city}} and its environs is {{preserved}} in virtually unchanged form. For various reasons (including large-scale destruction during World War II and construction of modern buildings during the postwar period in the largest historical centers of Europe), Saint Petersburg has become a unique reserve of European architectural styles of the past three centuries. Saint Petersburg's loss of capital city status helped the city to retain many of its pre-revolutionary buildings, as modern architectural 'prestige projects' tended to be built in Moscow; this largely prevented the rise of mid-to-late-20th-century architecture and helped maintain the architectural appearance of the historic city center.|$|E

25|$|The {{passage through}} the Gatehouse, crowned with the royal Bavarian coat of arms, leads {{directly}} into the courtyard. The courtyard has two levels, the lower one being defined to the east by the Gatehouse and to the north by {{the foundations of the}} so-called Rectangular Tower and by the gallery building. The southern end of the courtyard is open, imparting a view of the surrounding mountain scenery. At its western end, the courtyard is delimited by a bricked embankment, whose polygonally protracting bulge marks the choir of the originally projected chapel; this three-nave church, never built, was intended to form the base of a 90-metre (295-ft) keep, the planned centrepiece of the <b>architectural</b> <b>ensemble.</b> A flight of steps at the side gives access to the upper level.|$|E
25|$|The Lab-i Hauz (or Lab-e hauz, Persian: لب حوض, meaning by the pond) Ensemble (1568–1622) is {{the name}} of the area {{surrounding}} one of the few remaining hauz, or pond, in the city of Bukhara. Several such ponds existed in Bukhara prior to Soviet rule. The ponds acted as the city's principal source of water, but were also notorious for spreading disease, and thus were mostly filled in during the 1920s and 1930s by the Soviets. The Lab-i Hauz survived owing to its role as the centerpiece of an <b>architectural</b> <b>ensemble</b> dating 16th-17th centuries. The Lab-i Hauz ensemble consists of the 16th century Kukeldash Madrasah, the largest in the city, along the north side of the pond. On the eastern and western sides of the pond are a 17th century lodging-house for itinerant Sufis, and a 17th century madrasah.|$|E
25|$|Although the House survived as an {{official}} building—being used for the lying-in-state of Commonwealth Generals-at-Sea Richard Dean (1653) and Robert Blake (1657)—the main palace was progressively demolished from the 1660s to 1690s and replaced by the Royal Hospital for Seamen, built 1696–1751 to the master-plan of Sir Christopher Wren. This is now called the Old Royal Naval College, after its later use from 1873 to 1998. The position of the House, and Queen Mary II's order that it retain its view to the river (only gained on demolition of the older Palace), dictated Wren's Hospital design of two matching pairs of 'courts' separated by a grand 'visto' exactly {{the width of the}} House (115ft). The whole forms an impressive <b>architectural</b> <b>ensemble</b> that stretches from the Thames to Greenwich Park {{and is one of the}} principal features that in 1997 led UNESCO to inscribe 'Maritime Greenwich' as a World Heritage Site.|$|E
