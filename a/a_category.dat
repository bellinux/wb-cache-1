5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{developed into}} a tropical depression over the central Caribbean Sea around 12:00 UTC on August 23. Trekking west-northwestward, the system strengthened into a tropical storm about 24 hours later. It gradually intensified, and reach hurricane status south of Jamaica on August 25. The hurricane then curved northwest and intensified into <b>a</b> <b>Category</b> 2 hurricane on August 27. Early the following day, the cyclone made landfall near Cancún, Quintana Roo, with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). The storm weakened to <b>a</b> <b>Category</b> 1 during its brief transit across the Yucatán Peninsula, before re-intensifying into <b>a</b> <b>Category</b> 2 hurricane over the Gulf of Mexico late on August 28. The hurricane quickly strengthened, and attained its peak intensity on August 29 as <b>a</b> <b>Category</b> 3 hurricane with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). However, nearing the Texas Gulf Coast, the storm waned in intensity, and was only <b>a</b> <b>Category</b> 1 hurricane {{by the time it}} made a final landfall near Matagorda, Texas, on August 30. Continuing inland, the hurricane weakened, and degenerated into a remnant low over New Mexico on August 31.|$|E

5|$|Should the {{tropical}} system further intensify and have winds estimated or measured, as greater than 64kn (74mph; 119km/h), {{then it will}} be called a hurricane and classified on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The lowest classification on the SSHWS is <b>a</b> <b>Category</b> 1 hurricane, which has winds of between 64–82kn (74–95mph, 119–153km/h). Should the hurricane intensify further {{then it will be}} rated as <b>a</b> <b>Category</b> 2 hurricane, if it has winds of between 83–95kn (96–110mph, 154–177km/h). When a system becomes <b>a</b> <b>Category</b> 3 hurricane with winds of between 96–112kn (111–129mph, 178–208km/h), it {{is considered to be a}} major hurricane by the warning centers. <b>A</b> <b>Category</b> 4 hurricane has winds of 113–136kn (130–156mph, 209–251km/h), while <b>a</b> <b>Category</b> 5 hurricane has winds of at least 137kn (157mph, 252km/h). A post tropical cyclone is a system that has weakened, into a remnant low or has dissipated and formal advisories are usually discontinued at this stage. However, advisories may continue if the post tropical cyclone, poses a significant threat to life and property. They may also continue if the remnants of the system have a chance of regeneration and producing tropical storm or hurricane-force winds over land within 48hours.|$|E

5|$|While {{over land}} the system moved towards the {{south-southwest}} {{and moved into}} the Bligh Waters, where it started to rapidly intensify as convection erupted around the system. As a result, before the system made landfall on Viti Levu, RSMC Nadi reported that the system had intensified into <b>a</b> <b>category</b> 1 tropical cyclone, on the Australian cyclone intensity scale and named it Gene. The system then made landfall shortly after 0600UTC near Lautoka, before it started to move westwards and passed near Nadi before it {{moved out of the}} archipelago. Early on January 29 as the system moved westwards, RSMC Nadi reported that Gene had intensified into <b>a</b> <b>category</b> two tropical cyclone before it briefly weakened into <b>a</b> <b>Category</b> 1 because of the effects of a moderate amount of vertical windshear. However, the system quickly reintensified and by 1200UTC the next day had become <b>a</b> <b>category</b> 3 Severe Tropical Cyclone and equivalent to <b>a</b> <b>Category</b> 1 tropical cyclone on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale.|$|E
5|$|After gaining {{tropical}} characteristics {{throughout most}} of the day on November3, the storm was designated Tropical Depression Eleven. The depression quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Florence, the sixth named storm of the season. The storm briefly underwent rapid intensification, strengthening into a hurricane, before leveling out as <b>a</b> <b>Category</b> 1 hurricane. Florence was subsequently upgraded to <b>a</b> <b>Category</b> 2 hurricane on November7. However, a large extratropical cyclone located to the north caused the hurricane to rapidly accelerate, with forward speeds reaching 58mph (93km/h). By the next day, Florence lost its identity, while still producing hurricane-force winds, as it was absorbed by the extratropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{tropical}} cyclones {{that become}} extratropical quickly dissipate or are absorbed by another weather system, {{they can still}} retain winds of hurricane or gale force. In 1954, Hurricane Hazel became extratropical over North Carolina as a strong Category 3 storm. The Columbus Day Storm of 1962, which evolved from the remains of Typhoon Freda, caused heavy damage in Oregon and Washington, with widespread damage equivalent to at least <b>a</b> <b>Category</b> 3. In 2005, Hurricane Wilma began to lose tropical characteristics while still sporting Category 3-force winds (and became fully extratropical as <b>a</b> <b>Category</b> 1 storm).|$|E

5|$|As it {{completed}} its second cyclonic loop during March 2, the FMS {{reported that the}} system had peaked with 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 165km/h (105mph), which made it <b>a</b> <b>Category</b> 4 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center also reported that the system had peaked with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 195km/h (120mph), which made it equivalent to <b>a</b> <b>category</b> 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.|$|E
5|$|As {{the system}} {{continued}} to move west on October 9, it strengthened into a hurricane, {{and while it}} began to curve toward the west-northwest, further strengthening occurred, as it intensified into <b>a</b> <b>Category</b> 2 hurricane. The hurricane made landfall in Nicaragua on October 10 as <b>a</b> <b>Category</b> 3 hurricane. The system quickly weakened to a tropical storm as it traveled west-northwestward on October 11, later passing over the Gulf of Honduras.

5|$|Continuing {{generally}} westward, Dean {{continued to}} gradually intensify {{and became a}} hurricane on August 2 after an Air Force reconnaissance flight had recorded hurricane-force winds. The following day a decreasing ridge of high pressure {{to the north and}} a trough of low pressure forming off the East Coast of the United States caused Dean to slow in its forward motion and turn northwest. The trough of low pressure forming off the East Coast of the United States was deepening, causing Dean to curve northward while remaining nearly stationary. After remaining nearly stationary, Dean began to accelerate to a forward speed of 17mph (28km/h) as it headed toward Bermuda. Thereafter, Dean intensified into <b>a</b> <b>Category</b> 2 hurricane, whilst the eastern half of the eyewall brushed Bermuda. Dean continued to intensify slightly after passing the island of Bermuda and became <b>a</b> <b>Category</b> 2 hurricane on August 7. While Dean was <b>a</b> <b>Category</b> 2 hurricane, it attained its peak intensity with winds of 105mph (165km/h) and a minimum pressure of 968mbar (hPa; 28.59inHg).|$|E
