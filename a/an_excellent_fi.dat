40|$|Mixed matrix {{membranes}} (MMMs) {{composed of}} metal organic framework (MOF) fi llers {{embedded in a}} polymeric matrix represent a promising alternative for CO 2 removal from natural gas and biogas. Here, MMMs based on NH 2 -MIL- 53 (Al) MOF and polyimide are successfully synthesized with MOF loadings up to 25 wt% and different thicknesses. At 308 K and ? P = 3 bar, the incorporation of the MOF fi ller enhances CO 2 permeability with respect to membranes based on the neat polymer, while preserving the relatively high separation factor. The rate of solvent evaporation after membrane casting proves key for the fi nal confi guration and dispersion of the MOF in the membrane. Fast solvent removal favours the contraction of the MOF structure to its narrow pore framework confi guration, resulting in enhanced separation factor and, particularly, CO 2 permeability. The study reveals <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>fi</b> llerpolymercontact, with ca. 0. 11 % void volume fraction, for membranes based on the amino-functionalized MOF, even at high fi ller loadings (25 wt%). By providing precise and quantitative insight into key structural features at the nanoscale range, the approach provides feedback to the membrane casting process and therefore it represents an important advancement towards the rational design of mixed matrix membranes with enhanced structural features and separation performance.

40|$|Artifi cial {{lighting}} {{is the largest}} component of electricity use in commercial U. S. buildings. Hybrid solar lighting (HSL) provides an exciting new means of reducing energy consumption while also delivering signifi cant ancillary benefi ts associated with natural lighting in buildings. As {{more than half of}} all federal facilities are in the Sunbelt region (defi ned as having an average direct solar radiation of greater than 4 kWh/m 2 /day) and as {{more than half of all}} square footage available in federal buildings is also in the Sunbelt, HSL is <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> technology <b>fi</b> t for federal facilities. The HSL technology uses a rooftop, 4 -ft-wide dish and secondary mirror that track the sun throughout the day (Figure 1). The collector system focuses the sunlight onto 127 optical fi bers. The fi bers serve as fl exible light pipes and are connected to hybrid light fi xtures that have special diffusion rods that spread out the light in all directions. One collector powers about eight hybrid light fi xtures—which can illuminate about 1, 000 square feet. The system tracks at 0. 1 ° accuracy, required by the two-mirror geometry to keep the focused beam on the fi ber bundle. When sunlight is plentiful, the optical fi bers in the luminaires provide all or most of the light needed in an area. During times of little or no sunlight, a sensor controls the intensity of the artifi cial lamps to maintain a desired illumination level. Unlike conventional electric lamps, the natural light produces little to no waste heat and is cool to the touch. This is because the system’s solar collector removes the infrared light—the part of the spectrum that generates a lot of the heat in conventional bulbs—from the sunlight...|$|R
