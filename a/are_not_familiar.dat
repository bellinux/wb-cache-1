25|$|Despite the {{complexity}} of the kinship address system (see terminology section below), it is common to simplify it for the sake of familiarity. Some formal kinship terms <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>familiar</b> to many people, cumbersome, or not preferred by the addressee. For example, a cousin once removed may at her discretion be referred to as simply a cousin if she is of a similar age to the speaker.|$|E
25|$|Whether {{or not a}} {{bystander}} intervenes {{may have}} to do with their familiarity of the environment where the emergency occurs.

25|$|The {{quality of}} the {{finished}} transcriptions is a concern. Many outsourced transcriptionists simply {{do not have the}} requisite basic education to do the job with reasonable accuracy, as well as additional, occupation-specific training in medical transcription. Many foreign MTs who can speak English <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>familiar</b> with American expressions and/or the slang doctors often use, and can be unfamiliar with American names and places. An MT editor, certainly, is then responsible for all work transcribed from these countries and under these conditions. These outsourced transcriptionists often work for a fraction of what transcriptionists are paid in the United States, even with the US MTs daily accepting lower and lower rates. However, some firms choose to employ American transcriptionists as they believe the quality of work is better.|$|E

Their attorney released a statement saying, [...] "Decapitated plan to fully fight the allegations that have been brought against them and are confident that their side of the story will be heard."

[...] The [...] "hair-spring" [...] feature gives an advantage because it reduces the force required to engage the trigger, preventing unintentional hand movement while firing.

For guidance it also shows the typical values of μ and T in heavy-ion collisions and in the early universe. For readers who <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>familiar</b> with the concept of a chemical potential, it is helpful to think of μ as a measure of the imbalance between quarks and antiquarks in the system. Higher μ means a stronger bias favoring quarks over antiquarks. At low temperatures there are no antiquarks, and then higher μ generally means a higher density of quarks.|$|E
2500|$|The city {{described}} in the novel differs in some ways from the actual New Orleans. The first chapter mentions the sun setting over the Mississippi River {{at the foot of}} Canal Street. As this direction is to the south-east, this is clearly impossible in reality. Possibly this is a joke by Toole related {{to the fact that the}} area across the river is known as the [...] "West Bank", despite the fact that because of the twists of the river it is actually to the south or east from parts of central New Orleans.

2500|$|Since {{the script}} was {{conceived}} and popularised by {{the followers of}} Cyril and Methodius, rather than by Cyril and Methodius themselves, its name denotes homage rather than authorship. The name [...] "Cyrillic" [...] often confuses people who <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>familiar</b> with the script's history, {{because it does not}} identify a country of origin (in contrast to the [...] "Greek alphabet"). Some call it the [...] "Russian alphabet" [...] because Russian is the most popular and influential alphabet based on the script. Some Bulgarian intellectuals, notably Stefan Tsanev, have expressed concern over this, and have suggested that the Cyrillic script be called the [...] "Bulgarian alphabet" [...] instead, for the sake of historical accuracy.|$|E

The animals do have a preference for Bamba, the popular children's peanut-and-corn snack (though it gives the monkeys diarrhea); other common projectiles include bottles, plastic bags, and children's shoes. In 1997 a toco toucan {{was found dead in}} its cage next to pieces of avocado, a known bird toxin. In 2006 a hippopotamus died after swallowing a tennis ball tossed into its enclosure. Over the past decade and a half, the zoo staff claims that public awareness has improved.|$|E
2500|$|James Elkins voices an {{alternative}} to classical [...] "dispassionate" [...] figure study by stating that the nude is never devoid of erotic meaning, {{and it is a}} fiction to pretend otherwise. Even the staunch advocate of classical aesthetics, Kenneth Clark recognized that [...] "biological urges" [...] were never absent even in the most chaste nude, nor should they be unless all life is drained from the work. [...] However, most models maintain that posing nude need not be any more sexual than any other coed social situation as long as all participants maintain a mature attitude. However, decorum is not always maintained when either a model or the students <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>familiar</b> with the often unspoken rules. Models may be apprehensive about posing for incoming freshmen who, having never encountered classroom nudity, respond immaturely.|$|E

2500|$|Kumashiro's 1974 film, Man and Woman Behind the Fusuma Screen: Enduring Skin (Yojo-han Fusuma No Urabari: Shinobi Hada) starred Nikkatsu's reigning Roman porno Queen, Junko Miyashita. Movie critic Tadao Sato {{called the}} film [...] "a masterful porno film rich in emotion, anarchy, and nihilism." [...] Junko Miyashita won the Hochi News {{award for best}} actress of 1979 after {{starring}} in Kumashiro's Woman with Red Hair (Akai Kami No Onna) (1979), which the Weissers, in their Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films call [...] "one {{of the very best}} Nikkatsu pink films." [...] Uncharacteristically for Kumashiro, Woman with Red Hair has a straightforward narrative structure, but Jasper Sharp writes that it is still a [...] "difficult" [...] film for viewers who <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>familiar</b> with Kumashiro's work. The story, in which a sexually voracious woman comes to live with a construction worker, can be read either as a male fantasy, or as a story of a woman's search for sexual satisfaction. Roughly one-third of the film takes place in the bedroom, with the claustrophobic atmosphere heightened by such exterior sounds as moaning from neighboring drug addicts, and non-stop rain. [...] Sharp writes that it is perhaps best interpreted as [...] "out-and-out fantasy".|$|E
2500|$|Saeki said in 2001 {{that most}} Japanese people writing in English use western order, but that some figures began {{to promote the}} use of Japanese order as Japan became a major {{economic}} power in the 20th century. The Japan Style Sheet, a 1998 guide for producing English language works about Japan written by SWET, advocates {{the use of the}} Japanese naming order as often as possible because the translators wanted to promote a consistency in naming order. In 1987, one publisher of English language textbooks in Japan used Japanese order, while in 2001 six of the eight publishers of English language textbooks in Japan use Japanese order. In December 2000 the Council on the National Language of the Ministry of Education recommended that English language productions begin using the Japanese naming order because [...] "it is in general desirable that personal names be presented and written in a way that preserves their unique forms, except for registries and other documents with specific standards." [...] It recommended using capitalization (YAMADA Taro) or commas (Yamada, Taro) to clarify which part of the personal name is the family name and which part is the given name. In a January 2000 opinion poll from the Agency for Cultural Affairs on the preferred order of Japanese names in the English language, 34.9% had a preference for Japanese order, 30.6% had a preference for Western order, and 29.6% had no preference. In 1986 the Japan Foundation decided that it would use the Japanese naming order in all of its publications. A Japan Foundation publishing division spokesperson stated around 2001 that some SWET publications, including popular anglophone newspapers, continue to use western order. As of 2001 the agency's style sheet recommends using a different naming order style depending upon the context. For instance it advocates using the western order in publications for readers who <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>familiar</b> with Japan, such as international conference papers.|$|E
