25|$|Article VI, Section 4, of the Constitution of Virginia places {{upon the}} Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia the {{responsibility}} of supervising {{the administration of the}} entire court system of the Commonwealth. The Chief Justice may temporarily assign any judge of a circuit court to any other circuit court and may recall a retired circuit court judge to active duty. The Chief Justice may also designate a retired judge, an active district court judge, or an <b>active</b> <b>circuit</b> court judge, with his/her consent, to assist with a congested workload in any district. Other responsibilities of the Chief Justice include presiding over the various committees charged with improving the administration of justice in Virginia.|$|E
25|$|Chief {{among these}} is the Ninth Circuit's unique rules {{concerning}} the composition of an en banc court. In other circuits, en banc courts are composed of all <b>active</b> <b>circuit</b> judges, plus (depending on {{the rules of the}} particular court) any senior judges {{who took part in the}} original panel decision. By contrast, in the Ninth Circuit it is impractical for 29 or more judges to take part in a single oral argument and deliberate on a decision en masse. The court thus provides for a “limited en banc review of a randomly selected 11 judge panel. This means that en banc reviews may not actually reflect the views of the majority of the court and indeed may not include any of the three judges involved in the decision being reviewed in the first place. The result, according to detractors, is a high risk of intracircuit conflicts of law where different groupings of judges end up delivering contradictory opinions. That is said to cause uncertainty in the district courts and within the bar. However, en banc review is a relatively rare occurrence in all circuits and Ninth Circuit rules provide for full en banc review in limited circumstances.|$|E

It is very often that, when we design a circuit with a prescribed transfer function, installed RC <b>active</b> <b>circuits</b> are unstable, even though the designed transfer function itself is stable. One {{of the reasons for}} it is the existence of inevitable deviations of circuit element characteristics from ideal ones. In this paper we assume that the voltage gain of each op-amp is represented by the one-pole model and give a topological sufficient condition for the denominator polynomial of RC <b>active</b> <b>circuits</b> with these op-amps to be able to possess negative coefficient terms...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel compact modeling technique for linear(ized) <b>active</b> analog <b>circuits.</b> The new method {{is based on}} a recently proposed general s-domain hierarchical modeling and analysis method. In this work, based on the characteristics of analog circuits, we propose a constrained linear least square based method to optimize the order reduced admittance matrices with respect to both magnitude and phase responses up to the given frequency range. Theoretically we show that the hierarchical reduction does not change the reciprocity property of the linear <b>circuit.</b> For analog <b>active</b> <b>circuits,</b> which typically are non-reciprocal, so do the orderreduced circuit admittance matrices after hierarchical reduction. We propose a novel general multi-port, non-reciprocal network realization method. The resulting modeling algorithm can take in the SPICE netlists of <b>active</b> <b>circuits</b> and generate high-fidelity compact macro models of the <b>active</b> <b>circuits</b> with easily controlled model accuracy and complexity. The experimental results on two low-pass active filters demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. 1...|$|R
