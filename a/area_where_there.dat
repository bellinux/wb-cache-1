5|$|Foreign {{migration}} to Copenhagen, rising {{over the last}} three decades, has contributed to increasing religious diversity; the Grand Mosque of Copenhagen, the first in Denmark, opened in 2014. Islam is the second largest religion in Copenhagen, accounting for approximately 10% of the population. Muslims in Western Europe originate from both Arab and non-Arab countries. Those in the United Kingdom are primarily from South Asia, in France from North and West Africa, in Germany from Turkey, in Belgium from Morocco, and in the Netherlands from Morocco and Turkey.}} While there are no official statistics, {{a significant portion of the}} estimated 175,000–200,000 Muslims in the country live in the Copenhagen urban area, with the highest concentration in Nørrebro and the Vestegnen. There are also some 7,000 Jews in Denmark, most of them in the Copenhagen <b>area</b> <b>where</b> <b>there</b> are several synagogues.|$|E
5|$|The University Belt {{refers to}} the <b>area</b> <b>where</b> <b>there</b> is a high {{concentration}} or a cluster {{of colleges and universities}} in the city and it is commonly understood as the one where the San Miguel, Quiapo and Sampaloc districts meet. Generally, it includes the western end of España Boulevard, Nicanor Reyes St. (formerly Morayta St.), the eastern end of Claro M. Recto Avenue (formerly Azcarraga), Legarda Avenue, Mendiola Street, and the different side streets. Each of the colleges and universities found here are at a short walking distance of each other. Another cluster of colleges lies along the southern bank of the Pasig River, mostly at the Intramuros and Ermita districts, and still a smaller cluster is found at the southernmost part of Malate near the border with Pasay such as the private co-educational institution of De La Salle University, the largest of all De La Salle University System of schools.|$|E

25|$|Coming from {{a country}} <b>area</b> <b>where</b> <b>there</b> were no high schools, Eddington went to Perth in 1963 to attend Christ Church Grammar School.

In 1974, Eddington was the Rhodes Scholar from Western Australia. He completed his DPhil in the Department of Engineering Science at Oxford University and played eight first-class cricket matches for Oxford in 1975 and 1976. He was President of Vincent's Club in 1977.|$|E
25|$|Schools and {{government}} offices from Massachusetts to New Jersey and Pennsylvania were closed early or for all day, and locally some students were stranded {{for a few}} hours at various schools particularly in the Boston <b>area</b> <b>where</b> <b>there</b> was criticism over the management of the storm. In Providence, RI, students who had been dismissed early were stranded on school buses for up to eight hours. The storm did not affect professional sporting, as the National Hockey League game between the New Jersey Devils and the Boston Bruins went ahead as scheduled in Boston despite a game attendance of about 1500 at TD Banknorth Garden.|$|E
25|$|A {{bench grinder}} is usually {{used to create}} the sparks, but {{sometimes}} this is not convenient, so a portable grinder is used. In either case, the grinding wheel must have adequate surface velocity, at least 23m/s (4500surface feet per minute (sfpm)), but should be between 38 and 58m/s (7500–11,500sfpm). The wheel should be coarse and hard, therefore aluminium oxide or carborundum often are employed. The test area should be in an <b>area</b> <b>where</b> <b>there</b> is no bright light shining directly into the observer's eyes. Moreover, the grinding wheel and surrounding area should be dark so that the sparks can be observed clearly. The test sample is then touched lightly to the grinding wheel to produce the sparks.|$|E

25|$|Despite a {{great deal}} of {{publicity}} and promises, the history of human gene therapy has been characterized by relatively limited success. The effect of introducing a gene into cells often promotes only partial and/or transient relief from the symptoms of the disease being treated. Some gene therapy trial patients have suffered adverse consequences of the treatment itself, including deaths. In some cases, the adverse effects result from disruption of essential genes within the patient's genome by insertional inactivation. In others, viral vectors used for gene therapy have been contaminated with infectious virus. Nevertheless, gene therapy is still held to be a promising future area of medicine, and is an <b>area</b> <b>where</b> <b>there</b> is a significant level of research and development activity.|$|E
25|$|Economic {{growth in}} the state since the Mexican Revolution has led to steady {{population}} growth. However, this population growth has been concentrated on the arid coastline due to the dominant agriculture and fishing industries. Eighty five percent of Sonora’s population growth since 1970 has been in this area. Another <b>area</b> <b>where</b> <b>there</b> have been gains are municipalities with industry, such as in Hermosillo and along the United States border. However, those municipalities with none of these economic advantages do not see population growth and some see population decreases. Despite population growth, Sonora {{is still one of}} the least densely populated states in the country. About 90% of the state’s population is Catholic, with about 5% belonging to Evangelical or Protestant groups and over 7% professing some other faith.|$|E
25|$|Runaway slaves (cimarrones) became {{problematic}} {{to public}} order since they frequently formed robber bands that attacked travelers on highways. Crown efforts against these groups {{began in earnest}} in the late sixteenth century, but a major rebellion broke out in 1606 {{in the areas of}} Villa Rica, Nueva Veracruz, Antón Lizardo, and the Rio Blanco area. However, the gravest of these occurred in the Orizaba <b>area,</b> <b>where</b> <b>there</b> were about 500 fugitive slaves. In 1609, a leader named Gaspar Yanga led an insurrection against the Spanish but was defeated in battle. Unrest continued, eventually forcing the government to sign an amnesty pact and giving the Africans the right to form their own community, exacting as a condition that bandits be suppressed. This was called San Lorenzo de Zerral but today it is known as the municipality of Yanga. This was the first time slavery was abolished in the Americas.|$|E
50|$|Psammotermes is {{essentially}} a desert-dwelling termite, and seems to replace Anacanthotermes in drier areas.

The species even inhabits <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>there</b> are no vegetation: in those cases, it is thought to survive on the wind blown accumulation of organic debris.

25|$|Though a rookie, Sister Shannon {{training}} was completed and she {{reported to the}} New York City archdiocese. There, she patrolled two sectors from her assigned parish, Saint Thomas Church in Manhattan {{on the grounds that}} she was assigned to an <b>area</b> <b>where</b> <b>there</b> had not been demonic activity since the Purge of 1985. Replacing Sisters Sanguine and Hannah, she soon saw a sustained surge in New York City's demonic activity after her arrival. (A stock situation in comic books wherein the supervillains can appear only after a hero shows up.) She soon received her calling from the first Sister Areala after she was nearly killed in a battle with minions of Satanist and arms dealer Julius Salvius. On recognizing her as the Chosen One of that generation, the original Sister Areala gave Sister Shannon her name and awakened her latent power. It was made official when the Areala confirmed her as her avatar after a battle against the avatar of mad valkyrie Helga.|$|E
25|$|The Boat Deck was {{the topmost}} {{deck of the}} ship, where the deck housing, lifeboats, and funnels were installed. The bridge and {{wheelhouse}} were at the forward end, {{in front of the}} captain's and officers' quarters. The bridge was flanked by two observations platforms on the Starboard and Port sides so that the ship could be maneuvered more delicately while docking. The wheelhouse stood within the Bridge. The entrance to the First Class Grand Staircase and Gymnasium were located midships along with the raised roof of the First Class Lounge, while {{at the rear of the}} deck were the roof of the First Class smoke room, a deck house for the ship's engineers, and a relatively modest Second Class entrance. The wood-covered deck was divided into four segregated promenades: for officers, First Class passengers, engineers and Second Class passengers respectively.
