5|$|Flight of the Hippogriff is a steel {{roller coaster}} {{designed}} for families, located adjacent to Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey. The ride opened in 2000 as the Flying Unicorn. Similar to the Dragon Challenge, this ride was re-themed {{prior to the}} opening of the Wizarding World. The roller coaster's back-story is that Hogwarts's Care of Magical Creatures professor, Hagrid, is teaching young wizards to fly on a hippogriff (as Harry does in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) by using a wicker replica of the creature. A recreation of Hagrid's Hut is passed on the way for <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>from</b> Hagrid himself on how to properly approach a hippogriff.|$|E

25|$|Learning <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>from</b> the Trưng revolt, the Han {{and other}} {{successful}} Chinese dynasties took measures {{to eliminate the}} power of the Vietnamese nobles. The Vietnamese elites were educated in Chinese culture and politics. A Giao Chỉ prefect, Shi Xie, ruled Vietnam as an autonomous warlord for forty years and was posthumously deified by later Vietnamese emperors. Nearly 200 years passed before the Vietnamese attempted another revolt. In 225 another woman, Triệu Thị Trinh, popularly known as Lady Triệu (Bà Triệu), led another revolt which lasted until 248. Once again, the uprising failed and Triệu Thị Trinh threw herself into a river.|$|E

Additionally, Clasquin said the fact that even Priest Maxi recognizes Jesus as [...] "that guy from the public access show" [...] demonstrates that even the supposedly most religious people are not always the most open to genuine religious experiences. Clasquin also said elements of the Crucifixion of Jesus are alluded to in the boxing match with Satan.|$|E

Madhureeta Mukherjee of The Times of India gave the film a 4/5 rating and said, [...] "Ranbir, in the most challenging performance of his career leaves us 'dumbstruck'. Without use of conventional crutches of cool-catchphrases, dhamaakedar-dialogbaazi, bare-bodies, and other 'items'; he stuns you in every single frame. For Priyanka, there's only one wordBravo!

[...] Keyboardist Christopher Dudley stated that a majority of Underoath's audience is not Christian, nor are the bands with whom they would often tour. Though the band has been noted for [...] "setting precedent in both Christian rock and beyond", only a portion of their albums are sold in the Christian marketplace. Chamberlain said, [...] "I look at us as just another band in the secular market like with all these other hardcore bands and we just happen to be a Christian band that has different beliefs." [...] However, in an interview with Alternative Press, Drummer Aaron Gillespie stated that [...] "I'm definitely a Christian, but I don't think Underoath should be a 'Christian band'" ...|$|E

He [...] "question if this was really necessary" [...] and said, [...] "Shame on you, Vince McMahon." [...] He also claimed that the tribute show [...] "reeked of disrespect," [...] stating, [...] "Yes, the so-called tribute where afterward wrestlers point to their crotches and say: 'Suck it!' It makes me nauseous." [...] Other members of the Hart family also blamed Vince McMahon for Owen's death, claiming that the accident was the inevitable outcome of [...] "an obsession for ratings and revenues."

2500|$|It was {{not until}} the 1980s that a very {{detailed}} critique of Worlds in Collision was made in terms of its use of mythical and literary sources when Bob Forrest published a highly critical examination of them (see below). Earlier in 1974, James Fitton published a brief critique of Velikovsky's interpretation of myth (ignored by Velikovsky and his defenders) whose indictment began: [...] "In at least three important ways Velikovsky's use of mythology is unsound. The first of these is his proclivity to treat all myths as having independent value; the second is the tendency to treat only such material as is consistent with his thesis; and the third is his very unsystematic method."
