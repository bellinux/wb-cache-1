5|$|In {{the next}} match against Oxford University, Loxton {{came in at}} 4/206 and {{anchored}} the innings, remaining unbeaten on 79 as Australia were bowled out for 431. He featured in partnerships with Colin McCool and Doug Ring, who both made fifties. He then took the new ball in both innings, taking 1/14 and 1/16 from five and eight overs respectively in another innings victory. When Oxford batted, Philip Whitcombe struck a delivery from Ernie Toshack to Loxton, and {{took a few steps}} out of his crease. Loxton prepared to throw at the Whitcombe's stumps in a run out attempt, but did not release, while Whitcombe stood his ground outside the crease. In those days, the fielding standards were lower, with weaker and less accurate throws and Whitcombe was only a metre or two outside his crease, while Loxton was around thirty away. The next delivery from Toshack was again hit to Loxton, and Whitcombe again wandered outside his crease. This time Loxton threw the ball and hit the stumps directly, running out the batsman, who was unable to comprehend what had happened <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E

500|$|When Lightning Bar {{was about}} five days old Pollard was afraid that he had leg {{problems}} and was buck-kneed, and considered putting the colt to sleep.

2500|$|Marlowe is {{adept at}} using liquor to loosen peoples' tongues. An example is in The High Window, when Marlowe finally persuades the detective-lieutenant, whose [...] "solid old face was lined and grey with fatigue", {{to take a}} drink and thereby loosen up and give out. [...] "Breeze looked at me very steadily. Then he sighed. Then he picked the glass up and tasted it and sighed again <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{sideways}} with a half smile; the way a man does when you give him a drink and he needs it very badly {{and it is just}} right and the first swallow is like a peek into a cleaner, sunnier, brighter world." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Monday night fight {{lived up}} to its billing. In a preview of their two other fights, a crouching, bobbing and weaving Frazier {{constantly}} pressured Ali, getting hit regularly by Ali jabs and combinations, but relentlessly attacking and scoring repeatedly, especially to Ali's body. The fight was even in the early rounds, but Ali was taking more punishment than ever in his career. On several occasions in the early rounds he played to the crowd <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> [...] "no" [...] after he was hit. In the later rounds—in what was the first appearance of the [...] "rope-a-dope strategy"—Ali leaned against the ropes and absorbed punishment from Frazier, hoping to tire him. In the 11th round, Frazier connected with a left hook that wobbled Ali, but because it appeared that Ali might be clowning as he staggered backwards across the ring, Frazier hesitated to press his advantage, fearing an Ali counter-attack. In the final round, Frazier knocked Ali down with a vicious left hook, which referee Arthur Mercante said was as hard as a man can be hit. Ali was back on his feet in three seconds. Nevertheless, Ali lost by unanimous decision, his first professional defeat.|$|E
