They {{released}} the comeback album Die Bestie in Menschengestalt ("The beast in human form") and the single [...] "Schrei nach Liebe" [...] ("Cry for love"), their first song to have political lyrics. It was recorded as a statement against the increasing racism and right wing extremist violence in Germany at that time.

The album was more varied than previous releases, including ballads, punk, rock and even a song resembling Volksmusik. Both the album and single became big hits in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

[...] "I said I {{wanted to get out}} of my contract. He said: You can’t. You have your daughter to support, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>parents</b> are getting older. I said: Nobody would want me to be in this situation, I want to get out. And he said: I’ll ruin your career. I said: Do what you have to do. And he did ruin my career. He kept me under contract, paid me to do nothing for close on two years". Hedren felt so humiliated she called the director a [...] "fat pig" [...] in front of people on the set. Hitchcock made only a comment about it to his biographer, John Russell Taylor: [...] "She did what no one is permitted to do. She referred to my weight". The two communicated only through a third party for the rest of the film. According to Marnies screenwriter, Jay Presson Allen, Hitchcock was [...] "mad" [...] for Hedren. She felt unhappy for both and described the situation as [...] "an old mans [...] ", adding that Hitchcock had a [...] "Pygmalion complex about Tippi". She advised Hedren to finish the film and then get on with her life and be happy. Hedrens hairdresser, Virginia Darcy, even told Hitchcock he should not be possessive with Hedren. [...] "Tippi felt rightly that she was not his property, but hed say, You are, I have a contract". Although Hitchcock thought he might mend fences with Hedren and make another film with her, she refused to reconsider her decision. Hedrens contract terms gave Hitchcock the final say as to any work she could take on and he used that power to turn down several film roles on her behalf. She was particularly disappointed when French director François Truffaut told her he had wanted her for one of them. In 1966, Hitchcock finally sold her contract to Universal Studios after Hedren appeared in two of their TV shows, Kraft Suspense Theatre (1965) and Run for Your Life (id.). The studio ultimately released her from her contract after she refused to appear on a television Western for them.|$|E

40|$|Statistical {{learning}} is a rapid and robust mechanism that enables adults and infants to extract patterns embedded in both language and visual domains. Statistical learning operates implicitly, without instruction, through mere exposure {{to a set of}} input stimuli. However, much of what learners must acquire about a structured domain consists of principles or rules that can be applied to novel inputs. It has been claimed that statistical learning and rule learning are separate mechanisms; in this article, however, we review evidence and provide a unifying perspective that argues for a single statistical-learning mechanism that accounts for both the learning of input stimuli and the generalization of learned patterns to novel instances. The balance between instance-learning and generalization is based on two factors: the strength of perceptual and cognitive biases that highlight structural regularities, and the consistency of elements ’ contexts (unique vs. overlapping) in the input. Keywords statistical learning, rule learning, generalization, infants Imagine that it’s your 10 th birthday <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>parents</b> have given you a new video game—but the instructions are missing.
