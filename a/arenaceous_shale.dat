2500|$|The wine {{regions of}} South Africa are {{spread out over}} the Western and Northern Cape regions, {{covering}} [...] west to east and [...] north-south. Within this wide expanse is a vast range of macroclimate and vineyard soil types influenced by the unique geography of the area which includes several inland mountain chains and valleys. Within the Stellenbosch region alone, {{there are more than}} 50 unique soil types. In general, the soils of South Africa tend to retain moisture and drain well, having a significant proportion of clay (often at least 25% of the composition) with low pH levels around 4. The pH levels of the soils are often adjusted with lime and calcium treatment. Other soil types found in South Africa include granite and sandstone in Constantia, shale in Elgin and <b>arenaceous</b> <b>shale</b> in Walker Bay. Near the river valleys, the soils are particularly lime rich with a high proportion of sand and shale.|$|E
50|$|The {{fossiliferous}} {{layer is}} located in between the Bluff coal seam and the Aberdare coal seam. It is 15 cm thick and is composed greenish grey to brownish grey <b>arenaceous</b> <b>shale.</b> The existence of coal seams {{above and below the}} layer indicates that it may have once been a lake (lacustrine environment).|$|E
5000|$|During {{the harvest}} months of February and March, the average daily {{temperatures}} in many South African wine regions is [...] with spikes up to [...] {{not uncommon in}} the warm inland river valleys around the Breede, Olifants and Orange Rivers. On the Winkler scale, the majority of South African wine regions would be classified as Region III locations with heat summation and degree days similar to the California wine region of Oakville in Napa Valley. Warmer regions such as Klein Karoo and Douglas fall into Region IV (similar to Tuscany) and Region V (similar to Perth in Western Australia) respectively. New plantings are the focus in cooler climate sites in the Elgin and Walker Bay regions which are characterised as Region II with temperatures closer to the Burgundy and Piedmont. The wine regions of South Africa are spread out over the Western and Northern Cape regions, covering 500 km west to east and 680 km north-south.

50|$|M. fremonti was {{excavated}} in California {{from the}} Olenellus-zone (Pyramid Shale Member, Carrara Formation, Funeral Mountains, Resting Spring Range, and Salt Spring Hills), the Lower Olenellus-zone (Upper Poleta and lower Harkless Formations) and the Upper Olenellus-zone (middle {{part of the}} Latham Shale, at the Southern end of the Marble Mountains; Latham Shale, Marble Mountains, ½ mile East of Cadiz; the Mohave Desert portion of San Bernardino County; the Mule Spring Limestone, White/Inyo Mountains region), and in Nevada (<b>arenaceous</b> <b>shales</b> at the summit of Prospect Mountain, Eureka County).|$|R
40|$|The Deweras Formation {{between the}} Umfuli and Umniati Rivers {{consists}} of an upper series of arkoses and <b>shales,</b> (<b>Arenaceous</b> Series), a middle sequence of tholeiitic lavas, (Volcanic Series), and a lower discontinuous series of quartzite and conglomerate, (Basal Sedimentary Series). The succession is interpreted as being deposited in a variable shallow water to continental environment, which in this instance {{is believed to be}} associated with a step faulted or graben structure.

50|$|The folded hilly or mountainous North South belts, with {{perpendicular}} faults, comprise sediments of the Surma (Middle Bhuban Formation), Barail and Tipam groups. There is Aluvium in river beds {{consisting of}} deposits of argillaceous and <b>arenaceous</b> sandstones, <b>shale,</b> siltstones and mudstones and greywacke. A 560m thick rock succession of the Middle Bhuban type exposed between Bawngkawn and Durtlang shows 7 normal and 7 reverse magneto strata (North and South pole reversals) showing its age {{to be around}} 20 Million years old. The rock system is generally weak, unstable, weathered and prone to seismic and weather influence producing landslides. The soft, black to grey rock is used locally for building materials and for low trafficked road construction work. There are no useful minerals of economic significance apart from clays in the River Tlawng beds together with deposits of sand and gravels. Typical soils are sandy loam, clay loam that have been heavily leached due to the high slopes leaving it porous and lacking in minerals or humus.|$|R
60|$|The 'Father of the African Mines,' {{dating from}} 1878, {{lies on the}} {{northern}} third of the celebrated Tákwá ridge, and its concession embraces an area of 1000 x 2000 fathoms. The rich auriferous reef is the backbone of a long narrow line of hill whose diameter ranges between 1,000 feet to 600 where it is pinched. The lode strikes to the north-north-east with a dip of 47º west. The angle of underlay, I may remark, greatly varies in these Gold Coast reefs; some are nearly vertical (82º), others are moderately inclined (20º to 50º), and others run almost flat. The richest part, not including the broken-off ore, is from eighteen inches to two feet broad. It is decidedly more than 'one to two hundred years old,' as reported home by a scientific official on the spot. The 'coffins,' or abandoned native diggings, must date from at least two centuries ago. The natives scraped off the gold-bearing stone till the water drove them out. The formation is upper Silurian or lower Devonian, a transition to gneiss, but not highly metamorphic. No fossils have yet been found: if any exist they would be microscopic. Where talcose it is bluish, and shows streaks of 'black sand,' titaniferous iron. The grey sand washes to white. There are pot-holes which have been filled with either a pudding or a breccia of quartz. In places the gneiss has been so little changed by heat and pressure that it forms <b>arenaceous</b> flags and <b>shales.</b> It suggests a deposit in some ancient lagoon, alternately fresh and salt. A hard fissile slate of purple colour {{is based upon the}} ground-rock of grey granite; there is also a modern clay-slate, which lies unconformably to the older, and through it the great veins of gneiss and quartz seem to pass. The alluvial detritus, which fills up the valleys to their present level, is formed by the diluvium of the hills: in parts these bottoms show strata, from one to three feet thick, of water-rolled pebbles bedded in clay. Here and there the couch must be a hundred feet deep, and the whole should be raised for washing by machinery. These strata were apparently deposited in a lagoon of more modern date.|$|R
