40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{investigate}} numerically {{the evolution}} of surface settlement during continuous tunnel excavation by formulating and solving the poro-elasticity equations in a frame of reference, which is fixed to the moving face. In tunnelling through low-permeability soils, consolidation processes take place in general simultaneously with the spatial stress redistribution {{in the vicinity of}} the advancing face. Apart from the borderline case of highly permeable ground or very slow excavation, the excavation <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> must be taken into consideration. One can readily verify by a dimensional analysis that the time-development of settlement is governed by the ratio of <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> to ground permeability.

At the lowest supersaturation, the growth behavior was mainly the advancement of the initial step edges and filling in of the etch pits formed in the water before the BaSO 4 solution was injected. For solutions with higher supersaturation, the growth behavior was characterized by the advance of the and [010] half-layer steps with two different <b>advance</b> <b>rates</b> {{and the formation of}} growth spirals with a rhombic to bow-shaped form and sector-shaped two-dimensional (2 D) nuclei. The <b>advance</b> <b>rates</b> of the initial steps and the two steps of 2 D nuclei were proportional to the SI. In contrast, the <b>advance</b> <b>rates</b> of the parallel steps with extremely short step spacing on growth spirals were proportional to SI 2, indicating that the lateral growth rates of growth spirals were directly proportional to the step separations. This dependence of the <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> of every step on the growth spirals on the step separations predicts that the growth rates along the [001] direction of the growth spirals were proportional to SI 2 for lower supersaturations and to SI for higher supersaturations. The nucleation and growth rates of the 2 D nuclei increased sharply for higher supersaturations using exponential functions. Using these kinetic equations, we predicted a critical supersaturation (SI ≈ 4. 3) at which the main growth mechanism of the (001) face would change from a spiral growth to a 2 D nucleation growth mechanism: therefore, the morphology of bulk crystals would change...|$|R

The performance of furrow irrigation can be improved by measuring furrow irrigation <b>advance</b> <b>rate,</b> from which optimised values for irrigation parameters can be determined and implemented in subsequent irrigations. Most water detection methods for <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> measurement use water sensors that {{are located in the}} furrow, and which must be tediously collected from the furrow after the irrigation takes place. Design of an alternate system for <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> measurement has emphasised convenient, immediate recovery of advance data. Machine vision was investigated as an approach for measuring <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> for furrow irrigation. A high resolution digital camera at a fixed location {{at the end of the}} field monitors changes in field appearance during an irrigation. In the absence of a crop canopy, an unobstructed view of the advancing water front can be obtained from the end of the field. For more mature crops, under certain conditions, change in crop canopy appearance during an irrigation also travels visibly down the field. The digital camera has been interfaced with a laptop so that images can be captured, downloaded and analysed during the irrigation. Field trials indicate that a single camera can detect objects for distances up to 500 metres with an accuracy of + or - 5 metres, by use of optical zoom and by increasing the height of the camera. Experiments reveal significant tonal response of dry crop plants to water within twenty minutes of application of water. The image analysis involves two separate approaches for the bare soil and closed canopy conditions. Temperature sensing of soil and crop canopy temperature was considered in conjunction with the digital camera advance front detection, however due to budgetary constraints thermal response of the field could not be investigated for this project...|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{contribution}} of fractures (joints) in controlling the <b>rate</b> of weathering <b>advance</b> for a low-porosity rock by using methods of homogenization to create averaged weathering equations. The <b>rate</b> of <b>advance</b> of the weathering front can be expressed as the same rate observed in non-fractured media (or in an individual block) divided by the volume fraction of nonfractured blocks in the fractured parent material. In the model, the parent has fractures that are filled with a more porous material that contains only inert or completely weathered material. The low-porosity rock weathers by reaction-transport processes. As observed in field systems, the model shows that the weathering <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> is greater for the fractured {{as compared to the}} analogous non-fractured system because the volume fraction of blocks is 3 ̆c 1. The increase in <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> is attributed both to the increase in weathered material that accompanies higher fracture density, and to the increase in exposure of surface of low-porosity rock to reaction-transport. For constant fracture aperture, the weathering <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> increases when the fracture spacing decreases. Equations describing weathering <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> are summarized in the ‘List of selected equations’. If erosion is imposed at a constant rate, the weathering systems with fracture-bounded bedrock blocks attain a steady state. In the erosional transport-limited regime, bedrock blocks no longer emerge at the air-regolith boundary because they weather away. In the weathering-limited (or kinetic) regime, blocks of various size become exhumed at the surface and the average size of these exposed blocks increases with the erosion rate. For convex hillslopes, the block size exposed at the surface increases downslope. This model can explain observations of exhumed rocks weathering in the Luquillo mountains of Puerto Rico...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} written in {{cooperation}} with the Robbins Company to: - Document the effect of using large diameter cutters (19 ”) compared to smaller diameters (17 ”) - Document the effect of using 20 ” cutter rings on 19 ” cutters - Evaluate Robbins estimation methods to the NTNU-method and the recorded data. The report starts with a short introduction to cutter wear and the factors influencing on it. Before presenting acalculation of the effects the difference cutter diameters theoretical will have on <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> and cutter life. The calculations suggest an <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> of a 10 meter diameter TBM with 17 ” cutters being 77. 3 % of the rate of aTBM with 19 ” cutters. The 20 ” cutters will have an <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> of 91. 3 % of the 19 ” cutter machine. The cutter lifein hours is calculated to be 13 % lower for a machine with 17 ” cutters than a machine with 19 ”. The effect of using 20 ” cutter rings is calculated to extend the cutter life in hours with 16 %. The field work on the thesis is done on two 10 m diameter double shield TBMs boring in India, the AMR 1 projectand the Veligonda Project. Both machines are utilizing 19 ” with 20 ” cutter rings. The geological conditions arevarying for both projects. The field testing and the lab testing is done according to the NTNU model and includes net penetration tests andchip analysis. The processing and calculations are done according to the NTNU-model. The AMR 1 project has had an average penetration rate of 1. 62 m/h and a cutter life of 1. 25 h/c, or 2. 02 m/h. TheVeligonda project has an average penetration rate slightly higher 1. 90 m/h. The cutter life has been significantly higher with 12. 75 h/c in the first period at the project. On the second period it was a change in the geology and thecutter life was reduced to 1. 90 h/c. The utilization rates for the projects have been generally low with an averagemachine utilization of around 30 %. When comparing the results to comparable projects it gives the following indications: - The <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> is significantly improved when using large cutter diameters. - The 20 ” cutter rings have a beneficial effect on weekly <b>advance</b> <b>rates</b> in hard and abrasive rock. - The 20 ” cutter rings gives a slight economic saving in hard and abrasive rock compared to 19 ” cutter rings. The estimation of the AMR project from NTNU and Robbins has some major differences. This has been looked at indetail and it gives an indication of a systematically overestimation in <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> and cutter life for the Robbinsestimates. This leads to an underestimation of the cutter costs of the AMR 1 project. The biggest differences in theestimates are at the AMR 2 where the boring still has not started.  </p...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 The {{intermittent}} or cyclic {{application of}} water to furrows or borders, a method known as "surge flow irrigation", can significantly improve the advance characteristics of surface irrigation. Numerous field {{studies have shown that}} the advance of furrows is considerably more rapid when irrigated by surge flow than by the conventional, continuous flow method. In addition, the <b>advance</b> <b>rates</b> of surge flow have been found to be less variable among furrows than by those of continuous flow. Furthermore a large difference between surge and continuous flow is generally seen in the volume of water required to complete the advance phase. These facts have led researchers to conclude that surge flow may be capable of significantly improving the efficiencies of surface irrigation. Two field experiments were conducted in southern Oregon during the 1983 irrigation season to investigate <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> differences between surge flow treatments involving three different on-off time ratios and a continuous stream with an equal instantaneous discharge rate. Field data were used to construct power functions for each individual treatment relating advance time and advance distance. The derived power functions formed the primary basis from which the treatments were compared. The average advance-time and standard deviation for each treatment at designated stations along the furrow run were used in evaluating the variation in <b>advance</b> <b>rates</b> among treatments. The results of the field experiments, which were consistent with findings of other surge flow researchers, indicated that surge flow increased <b>advance</b> <b>rates,</b> significantly reduced water use in advance, and improved the advance uniformity among furrows. The experimental results will be submitted to others involved in surge flow research. To support the experimental studies, a computer model was developed and programmed to simulate both surge flow and continuous flow advance. The model was run for a continuous and a cycled flow with the model input based on the conditions during the second field experiment. In both cases the model underestimated the observed field advance. However, the infiltration input, which has a tremendous effect on the model results, had to be estimated from the observed field advance data rather than experimentally evaluated...|$|R
