However, there is no sound evidence that Edward ever wore black armour, although John Harvey (without citing a source) refers to [...] "some rather shadowy evidence that he was described in French as clad {{at the battle of}} Crecy ' en <b>armure</b> noire en fer bruni ' – in black armour of burnished steel". Richard Barber suggests that the name's origins may have lain in pageantry, in that a tradition may have grown up in the 15th century of representing the prince in black armour. He points out that several chronicles refer to him as Edward the Fourth (the title he would have taken as King had he outlived his father): this name would obviously have become confusing when the actual Edward IV succeeded in 1461, and this may have been the period when an alternative had to be found.|$|E

40|$|L’engouement que suscite une oeuvre d’art réussie est lié au fait qu’elle renvoie le spectateur à des aspects méconnus de sa propre vie psychique. Il en va ainsi de la bande dessinée Iron Man. Derrière l’armure se cache un homme pris dans les incidences traumatiques de la vie. L’analyse des mésaventures de ce personnage de comics dévoile une problématique narcissique très intense. Le {{dialogue}} conflictuel qu’il entretient avec son <b>armure</b> de fer questionne l’expérience interne liée au trouble du sentiment d’identité. De surcroît, cette bande dessinée fait émerger un questionnement quant aux conséquences de l’évolution de notre lien aux objets technologiques, à l’heure où notre dépendance à eux ne cesse de s’accentuer. The fascination {{surrounding a}} successful artwork {{is linked to}} the fact it faces the viewer to unknown aspects of his/her own psychic life. The same applies to the comics Iron Man. Behind the armour is hiding a man caught up in the traumatic incidences of life. The hero demonstrates a psychic weakness which, despite being deep, is, however, showing universal aspects. The analysis of his misfortunes reveals a narcissistic disorder. The article intends to set out the identity confusion the Marvel’s protagonist is trapped in while highlighting the addictive troublesome linking him to his high-tech armour. This article also seeks to attest the fact the symbiosis between Tony Stark and Iron Man is anticipating the evolution of our behaviour with regard to new technologies. To this end, the authors are recalling the episodes of the series. Through the analysis of the confrontational dialogue the hero is maintaining with his iron armour, they explore how the internal experiment related to the sense of identity disorder is figured out. Thus, going through the key moments of the saga, the authors raise the ambiguity of his hero. The metapsychological analysis of the actions undertaken by Iron Man reflects a little-known facet of his personality, revealing a character more tormented than he really looks. However, the point is not to “treat” a fictional man, but to observe how he can help us to understand the internal behaviour of our patients, and also our own. The Faustian drama this comic leads to is hence understood as a living testimony of our own psychic conflicts. Furthermore, the analysis gives rise to a questioning as to the risk of identity confusion the technological progress can create {{at a time when the}} Human is more and more depending on the machines he creates himself...|$|E
