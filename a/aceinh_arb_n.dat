40|$|Background: Previous {{clinical}} trials {{have demonstrated the}} impact of blocking upstream renin-angiotensin-axis with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) on arterial stiffness as evaluated by pulse-wave velocity (PWV). We ran a meta-analysis to evaluate the anti-stiffness effect of powerful downstream angiotensin receptor blockades (ARBs) on peripheral and central arterial stiffness (brachial to ankle, ba-PWV; carotid to femoral, cf-PWV, respectively), using a systematic review to assess the clinical arterial stiffness issues. Methods: For our study, we searched the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases from inception to June 2013, targeting randomized controlled trials. ARBs along with other antihypertensive agents, ACEIs, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), beta-blockers and diuretics were evaluated to ascertain their comparable effect on ba-PWV and cf-PWV, respectively. A meta-analysis was conducted utilizing the fixed or random effect of the weighted mean change difference between the ARB and comparator groups, depending on the I 2 statistic heterogeneity measurement. Results: In 2 trials treating patients with <b>ARBs</b> (<b>n</b> = 30), the ARBs insignificantly reduced levels of ba-PWV (pooled mean change difference- 188, 95 % CI- 687, 311, p = 0. 24 with significant heterogeneity) as compared to other hypertensive agents (ACEIs and CCBs, n = 77). Interestingly, <b>ARBs</b> (<b>n</b> = 20) had a superior capacity to reduce levels of ba-PWV than CCBs (n = 20) in single study results (mean change difference- 400, 95 % CI- 477,- 322, p < 0. 05). In 7 trials which included a total of 653 patients, treatment with <b>ARBs</b> (<b>n</b> = 308) also insignificantly reduced cf-PW...|$|R
40|$|Objective(s) : Several {{studies have}} {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) on peripheral endothelial dysfunction as measured by flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD), a widely-used indicator for endothelial function. We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the effect {{in comparison to placebo}} or no treatment and other antihypertensives. Methods: MEDLINE, Cochrane library and EMBASE were searched to September 2013 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the effect of ARBs versus placebo or no treatment and other antihypertensives (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), b-blockers, diuretics) by forearm FMD. Furthermore, we also use meta-regression to analyze the relationship between the endothelial function and the duration of ARBs treatments. Results: In 11 trials including 590 patients, <b>ARBs</b> (<b>n</b> = 315) significantly improved FMD (1. 36 %, 95 % confidence internal [CI]: 1. 28 to 1. 44) versus placebo or no treatment (n = 275). In 16 trials that included 1028 patients, <b>ARBs</b> (<b>n</b> = 486) had a significant effect (0. 59 %, 95 % CI: 0. 25 to 0. 94) on FMD when compared with other antihypertensives (n = 542). In 8 trials, <b>ARBs</b> (<b>n</b> = 174) had no significant effect (20. 14 %, 95 % CI: 20. 32 to 0. 03) compared with ACEI (n = 173). Compared with others, the benefits of ARBs, respectively, were 1. 67 % (95 % CI: 0. 65 to 0. 93) in 7 trials with CCBs, 0. 79 % (95 % CI: 0. 42 to 1. 01) with b-blockers in 3 trials and 0. 9 % (95 % CI: 0. 77 to 1. 03) with diuretics in 3 trials. Importantly, we found ARBs were less effective in a long time span (95 % CI: 21. 990 to 20. 622) than the first 6 months (95 % CI: 20. 484 to 0. 360) ...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{experimental}} and clinical studies suggested that apart from playing {{an essential role}} in blood pressure homeostasis, aldosterone is involved in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular and renal diseases by inducing structural changes in the heart, kidney, and vessel wall. The interindividual variation of aldosterone response to antihypertensive treatment is considerable, and is at least partially explained by genetic variation. In this study, we investigated aldosterone response to two antihypertensive drugsâ€”a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Genetic variations in 50 candidate genes were tested for association with aldosterone response in four independent samples: African American (AA) responders to a diuretic (n = 289), AA responders to an <b>ARB</b> (<b>n</b> = 252), European American (EA) responders to a diuretic (n = 295) and EA responders to an <b>ARB</b> (<b>n</b> = 300). Linear regression was used to test the association with inclusion of age, sex, and body mass index as covariates. The results indicated the existence of one or more variants in the kininogen gene (KNG) that influence interindividual variation in aldosterone response. The significant association was replicated in three of four studied groups. The single nucleotide polymorphism rs 4686799 was associated in AA and EA responders to the diuretic (P = 0. 04 and P = 0. 07, respectively), and rs 5030062 and rs 698078 were significantly associated in EA responders to the diuretic (P = 0. 05 and P = 0. 01) and EA responders to the ARB (P = 0. 04 and P = 0. 02). Although the clinical implication of KNG gene variation to antihypertensive drug response is yet to be determined, this novel candidate locus provides important new insights into drug response physiology...|$|R
40|$|The use of angiotensin-converting {{enzyme inhibitors}} (ACEIs) has {{been implicated in}} many cases of angioedema, but, given the {{potential}} mechanism of this complication, it was {{not expected to be}} caused by angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). However, in the past few years, scattered reports of angioedema associated with ARBs have appeared in the medical literature. We performed a retrospective chart review from January 1, 1998, through June 30, 2003, and a review of the literature. During this time, we managed head and neck angioedema induced by ACEIs (n = 27) and <b>ARBs</b> (<b>n</b> = 4) in 31 patients. All of them had significant mucosal swelling, and in some of them dyspnea and dysphagia coexisted. The most frequently involved areas were the oral tongue (13 cases), uvula and soft palate (5 cases), and larynx, mouth floor, and lips (3 cases each). Angioedema may be a more common complication of ACEI and/or ARB use than originally thought. This complication may occur after long-term use of these drugs. We advise that ARBs not be prescribed to patients with a history of angioedema, particularly that due to the use of ACEIs...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{characterize}} the 90 -day risk of hospitalization with pneumonia among patients treated with different anti-hypertensive drug classes. Design: Population based cohort study using five linked databases. Participants: Individuals {{over the age}} of 65 who filled a new outpatient prescription for one of four anti-hypertensive medications: ACE inhibitors (n = 86 775), <b>ARBs</b> (<b>n</b> = 33 953), calcium channel blockers (CCB, n = 34 240), beta blockers (BB, n = 35 331) and thiazide diuretics (n = 64 186). Primary Outcome: Hospitalization with pneumonia within 90 days of a qualifying prescription. We adjusted for ten a priori selected covariates, including age, sex, diabetes and number of visits to a family doctor. Results: Baseline characteristics of the groups were relatively well matched, except for age, sex, diabetes and frequency of family doctor visits. 128 of the 86 775 patients (0. 15 %) initiated on an ACE inhibitor and 43 of the 33953 patients (0. 13 %) of patients initiated on an ARB were hospitalized with pneumonia in the subsequent 90 days. 135 of 64 186 patients (0. 21 %) initiated on a thiazide, 112 of 35 331 patients (. 32 %) initiated on a BB, and 89 of 34 240 (0. 26 %) patients initiated on a CCB achieved the primary outcome. Compared to calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors (adjusted OR 0. 61, 95 % CI 0. 46 to 0. 81) and ARBs (adjusted OR 0. 52, 95 % CI 0. 36 to 0. 76) were associated with a lower risk of pneumonia.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{examine whether}} {{angiotensin}}-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) {{are associated with}} a state of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) resistance in hemodialyzed patients. METHODS: Cross-sectional study involving all dialysis facilities in French-speaking Switzerland. All patients treated with rHuEPO in March 2001 were included. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected in 515 patients treated with chronic hemodialysis (HD) and rHuEPO. Patients were classified into five groups according to their antihypertensive treatment. The main outcomes of the study were the mean rHuEPO dosage and the prevalence of erythropoietin EPO resistance among the groups. Erythropoietin resistance was defined as a weekly rHuEPO dosage &gt; 300 units/kg/wk. RESULTS: The mean rHuEPO dosage and the prevalence of EPO resistance were similar in patients treated with ACEIs (n = 138, mean EPO dosage 109 units/kg/wk, EPO resistance 12 %), <b>ARBs</b> (<b>n</b> = 59, mean EPO dosage 120 units/kg/wk, EPO resistance 7 %), both (n = 10, mean EPO dosage 109 units/kg/wk, EPO resistance 10 %), other drugs (n = 137, mean EPO dosage 110 units/kg/wk, EPO resistance 10 %) and no antihypertensive treatment (n = 171, mean EPO dosage 90 units/kg/wk, EPO resistance 9 %). Differences were not statistically significant. Patients with rHuEPO resistance were characterized by a higher frequency of hospitalization and a more pronounced inflammatory state. There was no difference in the use of ACEIs and ARBs between patients with and without EPO resistance (37 vs. 41 %, ns). CONCLUSIONS: Neither the use of ACEIs nor ARBs is associated with a state of rHuEPO resistance among hemodialyzed patients...|$|R

40|$|Aims. The primary {{questions}} {{asked by the}} MEDINA (MEtabolic parameters, DIabetes mellitus and NephropAthy) study are: 1) Do angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) have any advantages over angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) ? 2) Should the other drug for combination be aÂ diuretic or aÂ calcium-channel blocker (CCB) ? 3) How are the risks reduced by the co administration of a statin? Methods. A total of 439 hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome and/or diabetes mellitus were randomized to 2 groups: group 1 - ramipril (ACE-I) or perindopril and group 2 - losartan (ARB). Hydrochlorothiazide (diuretic) or amlodipine (CCB) were added to both groups. As aÂ third step, a statin was added. Results. Blood pressure decreased 24. 1 / 13. 3 mmHg in the ACE inhibitor group and 25. 9 / 13. 5 in the losartan group. The difference was insignificant. AddingÂ either hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipin was equally effective. There {{were no significant differences}} on metabolic parameters in the trial arms.
