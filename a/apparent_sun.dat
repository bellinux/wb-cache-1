25|$|Bu Zhi {{was known}} for being magnanimous, generous and capable of putting up with indignities – these traits earned him much respect from many people, {{including}} his enemies. He was able to hide his emotions well and project a calm and serious demeanour. However, the historian Pei Songzhi criticised Bu Zhi for supporting Sun Quan's fourth son Sun Ba in the succession struggle against Sun Quan's second heir <b>apparent</b> <b>Sun</b> He, and added that this incident left a huge stain on Bu Zhi's good reputation.|$|E
25|$|In 241, Sun Quan's {{eldest son}} and heir <b>apparent</b> <b>Sun</b> Deng, died of illness. One year later, in February or March 242, Sun Quan {{designated}} an 18-year-old Sun He, his eldest surviving son, {{as the new}} Crown Prince to replace Sun Deng. At the same time, Sun Quan also promoted Kan Ze to Crown Prince's Grand Tutor (太子太傅), appointed Xue Zong as the Crown Prince's Junior Tutor (太子少傅), and ordered Cai Ying (蔡穎), Zhang Chun (張純), Feng Fu (封俌), Yan Wei (嚴維) and others {{to serve as the}} Crown Prince's attendants and personal staff.|$|E
25|$|Sometime in {{the early}} 220s, Sun Quan, the {{founding}} emperor of Eastern Wu, heard of Cheng Bing's fame as a learned Confucian scholar so he sent a messenger to Jiao Province to recruit Cheng to serve under him. Cheng Bing agreed and was appointed by Sun Quan as the Crown Prince's Tutor (太子太傅). In 225, Sun Quan arranged a marriage between his heir <b>apparent,</b> <b>Sun</b> Deng, and Zhou Yu's daughter. Cheng Bing was designated as the Minister of Ceremonies (太常) and {{was in charge of}} the wedding reception in Wu Commandery (吳郡; around present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu). Sun Quan boarded Cheng Bing's ship during the ceremony and treated him with the utmost respect. Cheng Bing also guided Sun Deng on the formalities associated with the marriage.|$|E

25|$|Around the time, Sun Quan's heir <b>apparent,</b> <b>Sun</b> Deng, who was {{stationed}} in Wuchang (武昌; present-day Ezhou, Hubei), was actively networking with many people. He wrote to Bu Zhi, seeking his advice on whom he should talk to first because he knew little about the officials in Eastern Wu. In his reply to Sun Deng, Bu Zhi named 11 notable officials serving in Jing Province – Zhuge Jin, Lu Xun, Zhu Ran, Cheng Pu, Pan Jun, Pei Xuan (裴玄), Xiahou Cheng (夏侯承), Wei Jing (衞旌), Li Su (李肅), Zhou Tiao (周條) and Shi Gan (石幹) – and appraised them individually. He also advised Sun Deng to refrain from micromanaging, and instead learn from great rulers such as Duke Huan of Qi and Emperor Gao of Han, who delegated the task of governing their empires to their premiers (e.g. Guan Zhong, Xiao He). He also urged Sun Deng to attract as many talents as possible to join him.|$|E
25|$|Bu Zhi (died 247), {{courtesy}} name Zishan, was {{an official}} and military {{general of the}} state of Eastern Wu in the Three Kingdoms period of China. Originally a scholar of humble background, he became a subordinate of the warlord Sun Quan in the late Eastern Han dynasty and gradually rose through the ranks. Between 210 and 220, he served as the governor of the remote and restive Jiao Province in southern China. During the Battle of Xiaoting/Yiling of 221–222, he quelled local uprisings in Sun Quan's territories in southern Jing Province and maintained peace in the area. After Sun Quan became emperor in 229, Bu Zhi oversaw the Wu armed forces guarding the Wu–Shu border at Xiling (present-day Yichang, Hubei) for about 20 years. During this time, he also gave advice to Sun Quan's first heir <b>apparent,</b> <b>Sun</b> Deng, and spoke up for officials affected by Lü Yi's abuses of power. In 246, he became the fourth Imperial Chancellor of Wu, but died in office in the following year.|$|E

500|$|Earth orbits the Sun at {{an average}} {{distance}} of about [...] every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one sidereal year. This gives an apparent movement of the Sun eastward {{with respect to the}} stars {{at a rate of about}} 1°/day, which is one <b>apparent</b> <b>Sun</b> or Moon diameter every 12hours. Due to this motion, on average it takes 24hours—a solar day—for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the meridian. The orbital speed of Earth averages about , which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to Earth's diameter, about , in seven minutes, and the distance to the Moon, , in about 3.5 hours.|$|E
500|$|Shen is {{also known}} for his cosmological {{hypotheses}} in explaining the variations of planetary motions, including retrogradation. His colleague Wei Pu realized that the old calculation technique for the mean Sun was inaccurate compared to the <b>apparent</b> <b>Sun,</b> since the latter was ahead {{of it in the}} accelerated phase of motion, and behind it in the retarded phase. Shen's hypotheses were similar to the concept of the epicycle in the Greco-Roman tradition, only Shen compared the side-section of orbital paths of planets and variations of planetary speeds to points in the tips of a willow leaf. In a similar rudimentary physical analogy of celestial motions, as John B. Henderson describes it, Shen likened the relationship of the Moon's path to the ecliptic, the path of the Sun, [...] "to the figure of a rope coiled about a tree." ...|$|E

In 241, after Zhang Xiu returned from a battle against Wu's rival state, Cao Wei, at Quebei (芍陂), the Wu general Quan Cong and his son Quan Ji (全寄) accused Zhang Xiu, Gu Tan and Gu Cheng of conspiring with an inspecting officer, Chen Xun (陳恂), to make a false report about their achievements in the battle. Zhang Xiu and the Gus were exiled to Jiao Province.
