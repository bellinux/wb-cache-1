5|$|Apart from headache, about 50% of {{patients}} experience neck pain or stiffness, nausea, <b>and</b> <b>vomiting.</b> Other symptoms include dizziness and vertigo, facial numbness or weakness, unusually blurry or double vision, neuralgia, fatigue, or a metallic taste in the mouth.

5|$|Like many boletes, Imperator torosus causes {{gastrointestinal}} {{symptoms such as}} abdominal pain, diarrhoea <b>and</b> <b>vomiting</b> when eaten raw. These reactions {{can also}} happen to some people when the mushroom is eaten cooked, though others have consumed it with no ill effects. In a 1994 study, researchers Ulrich Kiwitt and Hartmut Laatsch looked for the antabuse-like compound coprine in Suillellus luridus and similar species that had been suspected of inducing antabuse-like reactions with alcohol. Coprine ingestion results in heat and flushing in the face, tingling in arms and legs, nausea <b>and</b> <b>vomiting,</b> and increased heart rate within five to ten minutes of consuming alcohol. They found none in the suspect species, but did find indications for it in Imperator torosus. They concluded that the most likely explanation for historical poisoning incidents was a misidentification of I.torosus with Suillellus luridus, though they could {{not rule out the}} latter species containing a hitherto unidentified compound causing alcohol-related reactions. No clinical cases of alcohol-related sensitivity have been recorded for I.torosus.|$|E
5|$|Stage 1 (30 {{minutes to}} 12 hours) {{consists}} of neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms and looks similar to alcohol poisoning. Poisoned individuals {{may appear to}} be intoxicated, dizzy, lacking coordination of muscle movements, drooling, depressed, and have slurred speech, seizuring, abnormal eye movements, headaches, and confusion. Irritation to the stomach may cause nausea <b>and</b> <b>vomiting.</b> Also seen are excessive thirst and urination. Over time, the body metabolizes ethylene glycol into other toxins.|$|E

5|$|After high school, Southern Mississippi offered Favre a {{football}} scholarship, {{which was the}} only one he received. Southern Miss wanted him to play defensive back, but Favre wanted to play quarterback instead. Favre began his freshman year as the seventh-string quarterback and took over the starting position {{in the second half of}} the third game of the year against Tulane on September 19, 1987. Favre, despite suffering a hangover from the night before <b>and</b> <b>vomiting</b> during warm-ups, led the Golden Eagles to a come-from-behind victory with two touchdown passes. Favre started ten games during his freshman year and won six of them.|$|E
5|$|Appendicitis {{may present}} with vomiting, {{abdominal}} pain, {{and a small}} amount of diarrhea in up to 33% of cases. This is in contrast to the large amount of diarrhea that is typical of gastroenteritis. Infections of the lungs or urinary tract in children may also cause vomiting or diarrhea. Classical diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) presents with abdominal pain, nausea, <b>and</b> <b>vomiting,</b> but without diarrhea. One study found that 17% of children with DKA were initially diagnosed as having gastroenteritis.|$|E

5|$|Chlorine is {{detectable}} with {{measuring devices}} in concentrations {{as low as}} 0.2 parts per million (ppm), and by smell at 3 ppm. Coughing <b>and</b> <b>vomiting</b> may occur at 30 ppm and lung damage at 60ppm. About 1000ppm can be fatal after a few deep breaths of the gas. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) concentration is 10 ppm. Breathing lower concentrations can aggravate the respiratory system and exposure to the gas can irritate the eyes. The toxicity of chlorine comes from its oxidizing power. When chlorine is inhaled at concentrations greater than 30ppm, it reacts with water and cellular fluid, producing hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hypochlorous acid (HClO).|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis {{typically}} involves both diarrhea <b>and</b> <b>vomiting,</b> or less commonly, presents {{with only}} one or the other. Abdominal cramping may also be present. Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72hours after contracting the infectious agent. If due to a viral agent, the condition usually resolves within one week. Some viral causes may also be associated with fever, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain. If the stool is bloody, the cause {{is less likely to}} be viral and more likely to be bacterial. Some bacterial infections may be associated with severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.|$|E
5|$|In United States practice, {{intravenous}} (IV) {{and oral}} administration {{are considered to}} be equally effective and safe if given within 8hours of ingestion. However, IV is the only recommended route in Australasian and British practice. Oral acetylcysteine is given as a 140mg/kg loading dose followed by 70mg/kg every four hours for 17 more doses, and if the patient vomits within 1 hour of dose, the dose must be repeated. Oral acetylcysteine may be poorly tolerated due to its unpleasant taste, odor, and its tendency to cause nausea <b>and</b> <b>vomiting.</b> If repeated doses of charcoal are indicated because of another ingested drug, then subsequent doses of charcoal and acetylcysteine should be staggered.|$|E

5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1945–1946, Slotin shocked {{some of his colleagues}} with a bold action. He {{repaired}} an instrument six feet under water inside the Clinton Pile while it was operating, rather than wait an extra day for the reactor to be shut down. He did not wear his dosimetry badge, but his dose was estimated to be at least 100 roentgen. A dose of 1 Gy (~100 roentgen) can cause nausea <b>and</b> <b>vomiting</b> in 10% of cases, but is generally survivable.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe maculata, {{commonly}} known as the frosty fibrecap, is a species of mushroom in the Inocybaceae family. First described by Jean Louis Émile Boudier in 1885, I. maculata can be found throughout Europe, Asia and North America. It is a medium-sized brown mushroom with a fibrous, brown cap with white remnants of a universal veil in the middle. The stem is cream or brown. The species is ectomycorrhizal and grows at the base of various trees, including beech. Inocybe maculata is poisonous, containing muscarine. Possible symptoms after consumption of I.maculata mushrooms are salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal problems <b>and</b> <b>vomiting,</b> with the possibility of death due to respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|Nausea <b>and</b> <b>vomiting</b> {{are largely}} {{determined}} by {{activity in the}} area postrema in the medulla of the brainstem, in a region known as the chemoreceptor trigger zone. This area contains a large population of type D2 dopamine receptors. Consequently, drugs that activate D2 receptors have a high potential to cause nausea. This group includes some medications that are administered for Parkinson's disease, {{as well as other}} dopamine agonists such as apomorphine. In some cases, D2-receptor antagonists such as metoclopramide are useful as anti-nausea drugs.|$|E

5|$|Other bite {{symptoms}} {{that may occur}} in humans include edema, which may become extensive, shock, watery blood oozing from the puncture wounds, nausea <b>and</b> <b>vomiting,</b> subcutaneous bruising, blood blisters that may form rapidly, and a painful swelling of the regional lymph nodes. Swelling usually decreases after a few days, except for the area immediately around the bite site. Hypotension, together with weakness, dizziness and periods of semi- or unconsciousness is also reported.|$|E
5|$|Systemic {{symptoms}} {{resulting from}} anaphylaxis can be dramatic. These may appear within 5 minutes post bite, {{or can be}} delayed for many hours. Such symptoms include nausea, retching <b>and</b> <b>vomiting,</b> abdominal colic and diarrhoea, incontinence of urine and faeces, sweating, fever, vasoconstriction, tachycardia, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, blindness, shock, angioedema of the face, lips, gums, tongue, throat and epiglottis, urticaria and bronchospasm. If left untreated, these symptoms may persist or fluctuate for up to 48 hours. In severe cases, cardiovascular failure may occur.|$|E

The scrapyard employees continued to feel sick during the following week, and on 12 February the scrapyard owner, believing the metal to be causing the illness, asked the scrap collector to take it elsewhere, and had the two smaller metal pieces thrown away.|$|E
