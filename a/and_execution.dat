25|$|However, {{the trials}} <b>and</b> <b>executions</b> {{of the former}} Bolshevik leaders, while being the most visible part, were only a minor part of the purges.

5|$|The smaller ghetto was {{liquidated}} in mid-October 1941, {{which left}} the larger one. From late October to December 1941, the ghetto {{was subject to}} Aktions, selections of people for deportation <b>and</b> <b>execution</b> in Ponary. Gens was afraid that {{the actions of the}} Germans would result in a widespread massacre. He persuaded the Gestapo to let the Jewish police round up the deportees. Gens, backed by the Jewish police force, was responsible for deciding who was to be sent for resettlement <b>and</b> <b>execution.</b> In October, this brought him into conflict with the ghetto's rabbis, who argued Gens was acting against Jewish law. Gens disagreed and considered it to be lawful to sacrifice some people to save others.|$|E
5|$|After Perceval's death, Parliament made generous {{provision}} to his widow and children, and approved the erection of monuments. Thereafter his ministry was soon forgotten, his policies reversed, {{and he is}} generally better known for the manner of his death than for any of his achievements.

The possibility that he was acting within a conspiracy, on behalf of a consortium of Liverpool traders hostile to Perceval's economic policies, {{is the subject of a}} 2012 study.|$|E
5|$|After {{several months}} of {{increasing}} tension between the factions struggling for power within the insurgency, {{the first of the}} pro-Chetnik coups occurred, in the Ozren Partisan Detachment.

Fighting ensued between pro-Chetnik members of the detachment and the Shock Battalion.

5|$|After the Nihil novi act of 1505, a {{collection}} of laws known as Łaski's Statutes was published in 1506 and distributed to Polish courts. The legal pronouncements, intended to facilitate the functioning of a uniform and centralized state, with ordinary szlachta privileges strongly protected, were frequently ignored by the kings, beginning with Sigismund I, and the upper nobility or church interests. This situation {{became the basis for}} the formation around 1520 of the szlachtas execution movement, for the complete codification <b>and</b> <b>execution,</b> or enforcement, of the laws.|$|E

As part of a campaign of de-Stalinization, he declared {{that the only way}} to reform and move away from Stalin's policies would be to acknowledge errors made in the past.|$|E

5|$|Before his {{execution}} {{a convicted felon}} was usually detained in custody for three market days, on each {{of which he was}} publicly displayed in the stocks, accompanied by the stolen goods.
