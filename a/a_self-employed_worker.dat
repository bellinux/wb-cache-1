Many intellectuals have described proletarianization in advanced capitalism as [...] "the extension of the logic of factory labor to a large sector of services and intellectual professions." [...] In most countries, entitlement to unemployment benefits is conditional on actively looking for work, and that means people, assuming they are not sick, are compelled to seek employment either as a salaried worker or as <b>a</b> <b>self-employed</b> <b>worker.</b> Geographically and historically, the process of proletarianization is closely associated with urbanization because it has often involved the migration of people from rural areas where they engaged in subsistence farming, family farming and sharecropping to the cities and towns, in search of waged work and income in an office or factory (see rural flight).|$|E

30|$|The {{model of}} Sect.  2 {{suggests}} an equation which {{allows us to}} obtain an estimate of underreporting of income by self-employed worker households in relation to salary workers households. In essence, expression (10) states that the food consumption of both types of households depends on reported income, on a dummy distinguishing whether the household {{head of the family}} is <b>a</b> <b>self-employed</b> <b>worker</b> or not, and a number of variables controlling for different socio-economic and demographic characteristics.|$|E

30|$|In comparison, the {{estimates}} {{change in the}} opposite direction for the self-employed after controlling for employment benefits. For instance, in column (1) of Table  8, <b>a</b> <b>self-employed</b> <b>worker</b> with non-family employees has a likelihood of leaving his or her job that is 0.242 times the likelihood for a private employee. This estimate decreases to 0.185 in column (2), after factoring out the effect of not having access to employment benefits. In fact, column (2) in Table  8 shows that the self-employed with non-family employees have the lowest likelihood of leaving their employment (although the differences with government employees and the self-employed without non-family workers are not statistically significant).|$|E
30|$|This section aims {{to build}} an {{analytical}} framework to estimate the degree of underreporting of income by households with <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> as household heads. The approach used here {{is based on the}} following main assumptions: (i) Food expenditures are correctly reported by households in budget surveys; but (ii) this not the case of income. Previous studies have qualified this second assumption setting that salary workers are completely honest by reporting their income while <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> hide part of their earnings. However, we really think that a most adjusted picture to the real world involves salary workers (at least some of them) that also conceal partially their income, although in a lower degree than <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers.</b> Consequently, <b>a</b> natural test for measuring the relative extent of such <b>a</b> underreporting by <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> consists of comparing food demand functions—which depend on income—of both groups.|$|R

30|$|For {{the sample}} of women, there is no {{significant}} impact of the enforcement measure on the chances of being a formal wage employee with respect to being <b>a</b> <b>self-employed</b> <b>worker</b> (column 2 of Table 7). This evidence indicates that women who were receiving mandated benefits and lose their jobs do not switch to self-employment, i.e., they move to informal firms where they continue being wage employees but without mandated benefits. Results also show an increase in the probability of informal wage employment with respect to self-employment (column 3 of Table 7). Self-employed women try to obtain a job as wage employees when enforcement increases, even when the impact on women is a reduction in the coverage of mandated benefits. This result can be interpreted as the expectation of obtaining a formal position in the future. Because formal firms’ demand is falling both for formal and informal female wage employees (scale effect), self-employed women switch to wage employment in informal firms.|$|E

By using a bivariate probit model, we find that tax morale increases with public spirit but it is lower among Palestinians involved in associational activities.

This indicates that the parameters for this group for all sectors are lesser than those for the secondary sector. The following interpretation helps explain this phenomenon. In the case of the second group, the percentage of agricultural day laborers is greater than that for the other groups, reducing self-employment; that is, in the regions where these communities live, it is necessary to own land to be <b>a</b> <b>self-employed</b> agricultural <b>worker.</b> But in the case of the first group (Chols excepted), everyone owns land (that is, the percentage of agricultural day laborers is very low), although usually only very small plots, and they produce their crafts on this land.

30|$|Despite the {{political}} debate on dependent self-employment, we know little about dependent <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> due to a lack of corresponding data. The British Labour Force Survey {{was the first to}} include variables that aid in identifying dependent <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers.</b> It is the only dataset that facilitates analysis over a longer period of time. The UK is also an interesting case because of its low level of labour market regulation and supposedly few incentives to circumvent regulations (Nickell and Quintini, 2002). Our first aim is to illustrate the prevalence and characteristics of dependent <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers.</b> Second, we analyse the characteristics of dependent <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> with data from the British Labour Force Survey, investigating whether and how dependent <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> differ from employees and (independent) <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers.</b> Third, we examine whether dependent <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> are rather pushed than pulled into this labour market state by analysing the associations of “good” and “bad” characteristics. Fourth, we consider whether dependent self-employment provides the chance to exploit business opportunities (“opportunity entrepreneurship”) or if such workers lack alternatives (“necessity entrepreneurship”). Finally, although data limitations prevent us from testing the stepping-stone hypothesis, we analyse the short-term labour market behaviour of dependent <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers.</b> Prior to these analyses, we briefly discuss the legal context of dependent self-employment in the UK.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{interactions}} among parental occupational choice and time allocations {{of their children}} in a developing economy. Data from the Mexican Time Use Survey 2002 indicates that informal self-employed parents demand {{a substantial amount of}} work hours from their children while minimizing their study hours. Self-employment produces gender specific patterns: Sons ’ work outside the household is the most demanded by substituting away study time and housework. Conversely, daughters ’ housework and work outside increases moderately and study time decreases also significantly. The data also suggests that self-employment is associated with less educational spending and less schooling relative to children’s age. This tradeoff implies a large obstacle in children development. Parent’s self-employment induces their children into low human capital occupations, thus, making poverty a persistent state across generations. Becoming <b>a</b> <b>self-employed</b> <b>worker</b> or an entrepreneur is generally viewed as a decision that has important implications on wealth accumulation. Not only does self employment may improve living standards, if the business project turns successful, but also provides a more flexible work schedule and leads to a more independently driven way of life.
