5|$|In 1989, NASA {{launched}} the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE), which made two major advances: in 1990, high-precision spectrum measurements {{showed that the}} CMB frequency spectrum is an almost perfect blackbody with no deviations {{at a level of}} 1 part in 104, and measured <b>a</b> <b>residual</b> temperature of 2.726K (more recent measurements have revised this figure down slightly to 2.7255K); then in 1992, further COBE measurements discovered tiny fluctuations (anisotropies) in the CMB temperature across the sky, at a level of about one part in 105.

Cyclone Cynthia developed rapidly in the Mozambique Channel on February16 and struck western Madagascar, killing 36people and ruining local rice harvests. <b>A</b> <b>residual</b> trough after Cynthia dissipated spawned Tropical Storm Debra, which looped in the Mozambique Channel.

Long-lived Cyclone Fatima originated in the Australian basin in late March and changed directions before becoming extratropical. On April2, a tropical depression struck eastern Madagascar, killing 18people. The final storm, Gritelle, was named on June10, the latest on record.|$|E
5|$|Police interviewed Farrar at 6:20 a.m, informing him {{immediately}} that {{the bodies of}} Tim and Kelly had been recovered. He told police about the deterioration of his marriage and health {{over the past six}} months. In August 1995, Farrar had fallen ill with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. He initially assumed it was <b>a</b> <b>residual</b> effect of the traveler's diarrhea many people on the Peru trip had contracted while there. Though he recovered from the initial bout of symptoms, he relapsed about a week later, and on August 18 Farrar was hospitalized with severe dehydration and high fever. In the hospital, he developed sepsis. Doctors identified Streptococcus viridans, which had probably leaked through damaged digestive tissue as a result of Farrar's severe diarrhea, as the source of the sepsis; however, they could not pinpoint the root cause of the gastrointestinal illness itself. Though Farrar's illness was severe and possibly life-threatening, he eventually recovered and was released from the hospital on August 25. That night, however, shortly after eating a dinner that Green had served him, Farrar again suffered vomiting and diarrhea and had to be hospitalized. A third bout of symptoms struck on September 4, days after he was released from the hospital for the second time. Basing their conclusions on the likelihood that his illness was related to the Peru trip, doctors narrowed down the possible causes for Farrar's gastrointestinal issues to a handful, though none fitted his symptoms perfectly: typhoid fever, tropical sprue, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Farrar had noticed that each time he returned home from the hospital, he became ill again almost immediately, and he speculated that it may have been due to the stress of his dissolving marriage or the change from a bland hospital diet to a normal home one. When Farrar's girlfriend, Margaret Hacker, told him she suspected Green was poisoning him, he initially wrote off the idea as ridiculous.|$|E
