40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a novel execution environment that can dynamically switch between garbage collection (GC) systems. As such, it enables application-specific GC selection. In addition, {{the system can}} switch between different GC systems while the program is executing. Our system is novel {{in that it is}} able to switch between a wide range of diverse collection systems. To empirically evaluate our system, we implemented annotation-guided GC selection and we show its efficacy {{for a wide range of}} benchmarks and heap sizes. In addition, we implemented a simple heuristic that automatically identifies when to switch collectors when program execution behavior warrants it. Our system introduces an average overhead of 4 % for both annotation-guided and automatic switching. Perhaps more importantly however, we significantly improve performance over selecting the wrong collection system (by 19 % using annotation-guided selection and by 16 % using <b>automatic</b> <b>switching,</b> <b>on</b> average) ...|$|E

40|$|During 1997 {{a number}} of {{hardware}} and software modifications were done to the RF control system, aimed at improving reliability and ease of operation. Over 100 new temperature measurement modules were installed to replace the most fault-prone of the originally installed modules, resulting in a big {{reduction in the number}} of spurious RF trips. All SC cavity controllers are now equipped with VME OS- 9 CPUs, allowing fast transfer of data to a central logging server. Software for tuner power supply monitoring, <b>automatic</b> <b>switch</b> <b>on,</b> and <b>automatic</b> setpoint adjustment has been implemented. During this shut-down the remaining cavities will be equipped with the new temperature measurement modules and hardware for improved RF interlocks diagnostics and HOM coupler interlock generation will be tested.

40|$|The LHC ACS RF {{system is}} {{composed}} of 16 superconducting cavities, eight per ring. Each ring has two cryomodules, each containing four cavities. Each cavity {{is powered by a}} 300 kW klystron. The klystrons are grouped in fours, the klystrons in each group sharing a common 58 kV power converter and HV equipment bunker. The ACS RF control system is based on modern industrial programmable controllers (PLCs). A new fast interlock and alarm system with inbuilt diagnostics has been developed. Extensive use of the FIPIO Fieldbus drastically decreases the cabling complexity and brings improved signal quality, increased reliability and easier maintenance. Features of the implementation, such as system layout, communication and the high-level software interface are described. Operational facilities such as the <b>automatic</b> <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> procedure are described, as well as the necessary specialist tools and interfaces. A complete RF chain, including high voltage, cryomodule and klystron is presently being assembled in order to check, as far as possible, all aspects of RF system operation before LHC installation.

50|$|The latest systems include <b>automatic</b> <b>switching</b> based <b>on</b> darkness+motion detection. This {{prevents}} {{having to}} reach to physically position a bottle dynamo or consume set-up time; this enables ready, guaranteed lighting {{regardless of the}} daylight conditions. A three-position switch has positions for Off, On, and Auto. A hub dynamo prevents the usage-overhead and preparation time of attaching the headlight and taillight to the bike prior to using the bike, and prevents having to remove the headlight and taillight and carry them while the bicycle is parked in public. A built-in light system avoids a failing battery lamp and prevents getting a ticket and fine from having no lights at night.|$|R
5000|$|From the {{technical}} standpoint [...] "Altai" [...] was fairly ordinary UHF/VHF trunked radio, {{but it was}} equipped with the <b>automatic</b> <b>switching</b> circuits <b>on</b> both mobile and static nodes that allowed the mobile end of the link to generate and transmit dialing signals and to connect the static end to the PSTN. Few initial installations used 150 MHz frequency, but as the network grew the later iterations switched to 330 MHz. Base stations have had up to 22 independent trunks of 8 channels each, and were commonly mounted together with the TV transmitters, sometimes even sharing the HF circuitry. This allowed for good coverage, as there were generally only one base station per city.|$|R
50|$|The {{lighthouse}} was discontinued in 1920, when {{responsibility for}} the light was transferred to Trinity House, who decided {{to establish a new}} beacon at Burry Holms. However, after pleas from local yachtsmen, the light was relit in the 1980s. This gave an additional point of reference when navigating the waters between the Gower Peninsula and Burry Port: on dark nights, boat crews often found themselves on top of Whiteford Point before realizing the fact. The cost was £1,300, with £1,000 being funded by the Harbour Commissioners and the balance by Burry Port Yacht Club. The new light was fully <b>automatic</b> and <b>switched</b> <b>on</b> when daylight faded to a pre-determined level. Two nautical almanacs published in 1987, Reeds, and Macmillan and Silk Cut, listed Whiteford Lighthouse as flashing every five seconds.|$|R

40|$|AbstractAutomatic <b>switch</b> is an <b>automatic</b> {{electrical}} device that uses sensor technology to detect movement, or body temperature that was {{detected in the}} switch. The sensor uses passive infra-red receiver (PIR) by using lithium tantalite (LiTaO 3) that will capture a moment as a response in temperature changes. In this research, we synthesized a thin film of lithium tantalite (LiTaO 3) on a substrate silicon p-type. The film was produced by chemical solution deposition (CSD) and engineering spin coatings with temperature annealing on 550 °C, 600 °C, 650 °C, 700 °C, 750 °C and 800 °C with 3000 rpm in speed for around 30 seconds. The value of high absorbent showed that the LiTaO 3 film has {{a large number of}} photon energy. This research obtained the energy band-gap film LiTaO 3 in the range 3. 41 - 4. 56 eV. This result concludes that annealed temperatures affects the optical properties of the LiTaO 3 film in the substrate of Si (100) p-type semiconductor. The sensitivity of this high intensity absorbent for energy and high value of band-gap is great and is therefore potential to be used prospectively for the <b>automatic</b> <b>switch</b> sensor <b>on</b> the satellite platform...|$|R

As a result, this act allegedly caused the final collapse of Link, which was declared bankrupt. UEI Group then briefly purchased the Company, after investing many {{hundreds of thousands of}} pounds {{in the development of the}} camera only for the poor design not being rectified in the design or prototype stages giving Link a poor reputation after several technically and commercially successful models. The company then transferred to the ownership of Quantel.|$|R
40|$|Skinning was {{initially}} devised for computing {{the skin of}} a character deformed through a skeleton; but it is now also commonly used for deforming tight garments at a very cheap cost. However, unlike skin which may easily compress and stretch, tight cloth strongly resists compression: inside bending regions such as the interior of an elbow, cloth does not shrink but instead buckles, causing interesting folds and wrinkles which are completely missed by skinning methods. Our goal is to extend traditional skinning in order to capture such folding patterns automatically, without sacrificing efficiency. The key of our model is to replace the usual skinning formula — derived from, e. g., Linear Blend Skinning or Dual Quaternions — with a complementarity constraint, making an <b>automatic</b> <b>switch</b> between, <b>on</b> the one hand, classical skinning in zones prone to stretching, and on the other hand, a quasi-isometric scheme in zones prone to compression. Moreover, our method provides some useful handles to the user for directing the type of folds created, such as the fold density or the overall shape of a given fold. Our results show that our method can generate similar complexity of folds compared to full cloth simulation, while retaining interactivity of skinning approaches and offering intuitive user control...|$|R
