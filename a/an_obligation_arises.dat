40|$|Contemporary {{international}} {{investment law}} {{is characterized by}} fragmentation. Disputes are heard {{by a variety of}} tribunals, which often are constituted solely for the purpose of hearing a single claim. The law applicable in a dispute is usually found in a bilateral agreement, applicable only between the two states connected to the dispute, rather than in a multilateral treaty or customary international law. Moreover, the international investment community itself is profoundly divided on many issues of substantive law, meaning both that the interpretation given to international investment law by a tribunal will be determined largely by those who sit on it, and that even the most authoritative texts are recognized as representing only their authors 2 ̆ 7 own views, rather than constituting a clarifying statement of the law as it actually stands. Given this context of fragmentation, it is perhaps unsurprising that states negotiating investment treaties have consistently incorporated one of the traditional means of bringing uniformity to international obligations, the Most Favored Nation (MFN) clause. An MFN clause in an investment treaty is fundamentally a promise between the two states party to the treaty that neither state will give to investors from any third state more favorable treatment than that given to investors from the other state party to the treaty. If more favorable treatment is provided to investors from a third state, <b>an</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>arises</b> to provide equivalent treatment to those investors benefiting from the MFN clause...|$|E

Monitoring is <b>an</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>arising</b> from Art. 11 and the results have to be reported every six years, according to Art. 17. In the last Italian National Report, covering the period 2007 - 2012, {{the status of the}} FCI was assessed using available knowledge and expert judgment, still revealing relevant lack of data for some plant species and, in turn, population parameters (Ercole and Giacanelli, 2014). To overcome these deficiencies, in 2015 began a project aims to set future monitoring activities and to optimize efforts at national scale. A network of institutions (Ministry of the Environment, Regions), research institutes (ISPRA) and scientific societies (SBI for flora) has been organized. Main objective of this project, to be reached by the end of 2016, is the identification of shared monitoring protocols for the FCI. For plant species ISPRA and SBI are engaged in the drafting of species-specific monitoring methodologies and schemes, based on the updated scientific knowledge and responsive to the EC requests. A working group made up of 12 units (10 groups for vascular and two for non-vascular plants) distributed throughout the country have been established. The monitoring protocols for each plant species (109 vascular taxa, 10 bryophytes, one lichen) have been developed and tested in the field for 12 target plant species, identified according to representativeness criteria for: life forms, phenology, ecology and biogeography. These shared protocols should lead to overcoming some current problems related to data heterogeneity and discrepancies from the EC requests and would allow greater repeatability and comparability over time. The results will be available in a dedicated website and in a National Manual for FCI, which will be published by ISPRA together with the manuals for fauna and habitats...|$|R
40|$|At its fifty-third session (2001), the International Law Commission (ILC) finally {{adopted a}} {{complete}} {{text of the}} Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. The purpose of those Draft Articles is to define “the secondary rules” which are aimed at determining the legal consequences of a failure to fulfill the obligations established by “the primary rules”. This paper attempts to assess the final results of the ILC’s codification works which had taken nearly 50 years. The term “international responsibility” covers the new legal relations which arise under international law by reason of the internationally wrongful act of a state. They occur between a state which has committed such an act and an injured state or states. An internationally wrongful act of a state occurs when conduct consisting of an action or its omission is attributable to the state under international law and constitutes a breach of <b>an</b> international <b>obligation</b> of that state. The content of new rights and obligations is specified in Part Two (Content of the International Responsibility) and Part Three (Implementation o f the International Responsibility) of the Draft Articles. The obligations of the responsible state to cease the wrongful conduct if it is continuing; to offer appropriate assurances and guarantees of non-repetition if circumstances so require, and to make full reparation for the injury caused are the core legal consequences of an internationally wrongful act. A serious breach of <b>an</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>arising</b> under <b>a</b> peremptory norm of general international law may entail further consequences. In {{the event of a}} serious breach of ius cogens rules all states are obliged to cooperate in order to bring such a breach to an end, not to recognize as lawful the situation created by that act and not to render aid or assistance to the responsible state to maintain the situation so created. The implementation of state responsibility is, in the first place, an entitlement of “the injured state”. This concept refers to the state whose individual right has been infringed by the internationally wrongful act or which has been particularly affected by it. In case of breaches of obligations protecting the collective interests of a group of states or the international community as a whole, responsibility may be invoked by states which are not themselves “injured” in the sense of Articl...|$|R
40|$|Liberalisation {{of public}} {{services}} cannot only be implemented via autonomous legislative action by nation states, {{but also as}} <b>a</b> consequence of <b>obligations</b> <b>arising</b> from supra- or international organisations.

Thus, we will try to highlight the specific role of services negotiations in the WTO for the political dynamics of liberalising public services in the EU. Our conclusions highlight three specific functions of the GATS agreement: firstly it serves as an institutional mechanism to lock-in liberalisations achieved at a national or European level, secondly it exercises a disciplinary effect on national regulation, and thirdly, it provides an additional platform for the application of forum-shifting in the politics of international trade...|$|R

50|$|The issue {{involved}} {{a determination of}} the level of connection that must exist between a non-resident corporation and a state in order for that corporation to be sued within that state. The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone (and in which Justice Robert Jackson did not participate), held that in view of 26 U.S.C. § 1606(a) (providing that no person shall be relieved from compliance with a state law requiring payments to an unemployment fund on the ground that he is engaged in interstate commerce) the fact that the corporation is engaged in interstate commerce does not relieve it from liability for payments to the state unemployment compensation fund. The activities in behalf of the corporation render it amenable to suit in courts of the State to recover payments due to the state unemployment compensation fund. The activities in question established sufficient contacts or ties between the State and the corporation to make it reasonable and just, and in conformity to the due process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, for the State to enforce against the corporation <b>an</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>arising</b> out of such activities. In such a suit to recover payments due to the unemployment compensation fund, service of process upon one of the corporation's salesmen within the State, and notice sent by registered mail to the corporation at its home office, satisfies the requirements of due process. The tax imposed by the state unemployment compensation statute - construed by the state court, in its application to the corporation, as a tax on the privilege of employing salesmen within the State - does not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In reaching its decision the Court stated that throughout American history, the jurisdiction of courts to render judgment in personam has been grounded on their de facto power over the defendant's person. Hence, his presence within the territorial jurisdiction of a court was prerequisite to its rendition of a judgment personally binding him. But now that the capias ad respondendum has given way to personal service of summons or other form of notice, due process requires only that, in order to subject a defendant to a judgment in personam, if he be not present within the territory of the forum, he have certain minimum contacts with it such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. Justice Hugo Black wrote a separate opinion, agreeing with the outcome in this case, but contending that the Court has excessively restricted the power of states to find jurisdiction over companies doing business therein.|$|R

40|$|The non-contractual-contractual divide {{represents}} the basic criterion of qualification in private law liability. The essential {{difference between them}} is that whereas tortious <b>obligation</b> <b>arises</b> as <b>a</b> liability <b>obligation</b> i. e. as <b>an</b> <b>obligation</b> to pay damages, contractual <b>obligation</b> <b>arises</b> as <b>a</b> duty of performance which changes itself into <b>an</b> <b>obligation</b> of damages only in case of non-performance. What is true is that both contractual and extracontractual liability have damage in common, the objective element of every private law liability. The question is not always one of alternative between contractual and non-contractual liability. On the contrary, both {{can be thought of}} as being simoultaneously apt to rule single types of fact. A coincidence between contractual and non-contractual liability is typically the case when performance is so to say applied directly to the person or a good of the creditor, as in cases of medical practice or services in general. The counterway of a possible overlap is that in which conduct of debtor is not in itself non performance but infringes some other protected interest of creditor, giving rise to a tort. The judicial trend shows that courts talk of possible concurrence of tortious liability with the contractual one when this ends up in favour of the victim; on the other hand they opt for a purely contractual approach if this produces the only or most effective remedy for the victim. Through a analytical appraisal of the courts' attitude, the author concludes that the rule of concurrence in Italian law has only a sectorial range. This explains the idea manifested in literature, according to which concurrence between contractual and non contractual liability hardly can be justified in dogmatic terms, whereas it appears to find only reasons of «pure equity and contingent empiricism»...|$|R
