30|$|Fallopian tube torsion is an {{exceptionally}} rare eventuality (1 / 1.5 million) and usually affects adolescent {{girls and women}} of reproductive age [62]. Torsion of the right fallopian tube is much more common, supposedly due {{to the presence of}} the sigmoid colon and the mesentery that <b>anchor</b> the <b>tube</b> to the left pelvis. Diagnosis of ovarian torsion continues to be a difficult task, requiring awareness and a high degree of suspicion. The most consistent imaging finding is a unilateral enlarged ovary, without which the diagnosis is unlikely to be ovarian torsion. Comparison with the asymptomatic contralateral side is typically very helpful [63]. MRI is used to differentiate a tubal torsion from ovarian cancer, showing a normal ovary separate from the mass; on T 2 -weighted images it is seen as a wall thickening of the distended fallopian tube. Sometimes the tube assumes a vortex-like conformation distant from ipsilateral ovary [64]. The dynamic subtraction MR images can also facilitate the demonstration of the absence of blood flow.|$|R

From this model we suggest the origin for two important and widely studied properties of solar flare statistics, including the time-energy correlations. We first propose that the scale-free energy distribution of solar flares is largely due to the twist exerted by the vorticity of the turbulent photosphere. Second, the long-range temporal and time-energy correlations appear to arise from the tube-tube interactions. The agreement with satellite measurements is encouraging.

The resulting hollow tube assembly serves as a representation of a transmembrane channel, pore, or a carbon nanotube. The interactions of a coarse grain di-myristoyl-phosphatidyl-choline hydrated bilayer with both a purely hydrophobic tube and a tube with hydrophilic caps are studied. The hydrophobic tube rotates in the membrane and becomes blocked by lipid tails after a few tens of nanoseconds. The hydrophilic sites of the capped tube stabilize it by <b>anchoring</b> the <b>tube</b> in the lipid headgroup/water interfacial region of each membrane leaflet.

Spontaneous tube insertion into an undisturbed lipid bilayer is also studied, which we reported briefly in a previous publication. The hydrophobic tube submerges into the membrane core in a carpetlike manner.

40|$|The “no hair ” theorem, a key {{result in}} General Relativity, states that an {{isolated}} black hole {{is defined by}} only three parameters: mass, angular momentum, and electric charge; this asymptotic state is reached on a light-crossing time scale. We find that the “no hair ” theorem is not formally applicable for black holes formed from collapse of a rotating neutron star. Rotating neutron stars can self-produce particles via vacuum breakdown forming a highly conducting plasma magnetosphere such that magnetic field lines are effectively “frozen-in ” the star both before and during collapse. In the limit of no resistivity, this introduces a topological constraint which prohibits the magnetic field from sliding off the newly-formed event horizon. As a result, during collapse of a neutron star into a black hole, the latter conserves the number of magnetic flux tubes NB = eΦ∞/(pic~), where Φ ∞ ≈ 2 pi 2 BNSR 3 NS/(PNSc) is the initial magnetic flux through the hemispheres of the progenitor and out to infinity. We test this theoretical result via three-dimensional general relativistic plasma simulations of rotating black holes that start with a neutron star dipole magnetic field with no currents initially present outside the event horizon.

40|$|Straight-forward {{models of}} X-ray {{reflection}} in the inner region of accretion discs predict that primary X-ray flux and the flux reflected off {{the surface of the}} disc should vary together, albeit a short light travel time delay. Most of the observations, however, show that the X-ray flux can vary while the reflected features remain constant. Here we propose a simple explanation to this. In all likelihood, the emission of a moderately optically thick magnetic flare atop an accretion disc is anisotropic. A constant energy release rate in a flare will appear to produce a variable X-ray flux as the flare rotates with the accretion disc <b>anchoring</b> the magnetic <b>tube.</b> The reflector, on the other hand, receives a constant X-ray flux from the flare. Since the reflected emission is azimuthally symmetric, the observer will see a roughly constant reflected flux (neglecting relativistic effects). The model does not produce quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) if magnetic flux tubes are sheared out faster than they complete one orbit. Comment: submitted to MNRAS Letters; 3 page...|$|R
40|$|Viral {{factories}} are novel structures built by viruses in infected cells. During their construction organelles are recruited {{and build a}} large scaffold for viral replication and morphogenesis. We have studied how a bunyavirus uses the Golgi to build the factory. With the help of confocal and 3 D ultrastructural imaging together with molecular mapping in situ and in vitro we have characterized a tubular structure that harbours the viral replication complexes in a globular domain. Numerous ribonucleoproteins were released from purified tubes disrupted in vitro. Actin and myosin I were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting in isolated tubes while actin and the viral NSm non-structural protein were detected in the tubes' internal proteinaceous scaffold by immunogold labelling. Studies with NSm deletion mutants and drugs affecting actin showed that both NSm and actin are key factors for tube and virus assembly in Golgi.

40|$|Abstract. Self excited {{combustion}} oscillations {{are caused}} by a coupling between acoustic waves and unsteady heat release. A premixed laminar flame in a Rijke <b>tube,</b> <b>anchored</b> to a metal gauze, is considered in this work. The flame response to flow disturbances is investigated by developing a nonlinear kinematic model based on the classical G-equation, with the assumption of a time-invariant laminar flame speed. Unsteady heat release from the flame {{is assumed to be}} caused by its surface variations, which results from the fluctuations of the oncoming flow velocity. The flame is acoustically compact, and its presence causes the mean temperature undergoing a jump, whose effect on the dynamics of the thermo-acoustic system is discussed. Coupling the flame model with a Galerkin series expansion of the acoustic waves present enables the time evolution of the flow disturbances to be calculated. It was found that the model can predict the mode shape and the frequencies of the excited combustion oscillations very well. Moreover, the fundamental mode is found to be the easiest one to be triggered among all acoustic modes. To gain insight about the mode selection and triggering, further numerical investigation is conducted by linearizing the flame model and recasting into the popular τ−n formulation...|$|R

A favourable conjunction of these spacecraft culminated in the observation of a series of flux transfer events (FTEs), characterised by bipolar perturbations in the component of the {{magnetic field}} normal to the magnetopause, an enhancement in the overall mag- netic field strength, and field tilting effects in the plane of the magnetopause whilst the satellites were located on the magnetosheath side of the boundary. Whilst a subset of the FTE signatures observed could be identified as being either normal or reverse polarity, the rapid succession of events observed made it difficult to classify some of the signatures unambiguously. Nevertheless, by considering the source region and motion of flux tubes opened by magnetic reconnection at low latitudes (i. e. between Cluster and Geotail), we demonstrate that the observations are consistent with the motion of northward (southward) and tailward moving flux <b>tubes</b> <b>anchored</b> in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere passing in close proximity to the Cluster (Geotail) satellites.

40|$|We {{propose that}} the curious Galactic Center {{filament}} known as "The Snake" is a twisted giant magnetic flux <b>tube,</b> <b>anchored</b> in rotating molecular clouds. The MHD kink instability generates coils in the tube and subsequent magnetic reconnection injects relativistic electrons. Electrons diffuse away from a coil at an energy-dependent rate producing a flat spectral index at large distances from it. Our fit to the data of gray 95 a shows that the magnetic field ∼ 0. 4 mG is large compared to the ambient ∼ 7 μ G field, indicating that the flux tube is force-free. If the relative level of turbulence in the Snake and the general interstellar medium are similar, then electrons have been diffusing in the Snake for about 3 × 10 ^ 5 yr, comparable to the timescale at which magnetic energy is annihilated in the major kink. Estimates of the magnetic field in the G 359. 19 - 0. 05 molecular complex are similar to our estimate of the magnetic field in the Snake suggesting a strong connection between the physics of the anchoring molecular regions and the Snake.

40|$|Magnetic {{helicity}} {{has become}} a valuable tool for understanding the energetics and dynamics of coronal magnetic fields. Recently long time-sequences of magnetograms {{have been used to}} measure the flux of helicity into active region coronae. We demonstrate how this helicity flux can be usefully decomposed into contributions of differing origin, called spin helicity and braiding helicity. These contributions would typically {{come at the expense of}} twist and writhe helicity, respectively, of a sub-photospheric flux <b>tube</b> <b>anchored</b> to the regions. In order to effect this decomposition each magnetogram is partitioned into a set of unipolar regions. We present a method to define such regions so that they persist through the sequences and track the photospheric flow. The spin helicity of a given region quantifies the mean rotation rate of motions internal to that region, while braiding helicity is injected by the motions of whole regions about one another. Applying the method to six active regions shows cases where either spin or braiding dominates, and where they have the same signs and opposite signs. Thus it would seem that no general statement can be made regarding the dominance of twist or writhe in supplying helicity to the corona. In one particular case spin and braiding helicity follow different time histories but inject equal and opposite net helicities. This suggests that the spinning and braiding are driven by a kink instability in the submerged flux tube. Subject headings: MHD — Sun: magnetic fields – 2 – 1...|$|R

Burial activities at the site occurred during the 1950 's when the property was under the ownership of the United States Air Force. Included is a discussion of methods and strategies {{that were used to}} successfully exhume and characterize the wastes for proper disposal at offsite disposal facilities. Worker and environmental protection measures are also described. Information gained from this project may be used at other similar project sites. A total of nine burial tubes had been identified for excavation, characterization, and removal from the site. The disposal tubes were constructed of 4 -ft lengths of concrete pipe buried upright with the upper ends flush with ground surface. Initial ground level observations of the burial tubes indicated that some weathering had occurred; however, the condition of the subsurface portions of the tubes was unknown. Soil excavation occurred in 1 -foot lifts in order that the tubes could be inspected and to allow for characterization of the soils at each stage of the excavation. Due to the weight of the concrete pipe and the condition of the piping joints it was determined that special measures would be required to maintain the tubes intact during their removal. Special <b>tube</b> <b>anchoring</b> and handling methods were required to relocate the tubes from their initial positions to a staging area where they could be further characterized. Characterization of the disposal tubes was accomplished using a combination of gamma spectroscopy and activity mapping methods. Important aspects of the project included the use of specialized excavation and disposal tube reinforcement measures to maintain the disposal tubes intact during excavation, removal and subsequent characterization.

In some cases it is no longer enough for devices to be sterile when they are implanted into an individual, now they must be proactive in fighting off bacterial infection. As such antibiotics are now being added into the surface of implanted devices as an added layer of defense against the threat of infection. One such infection is Osteomyelitis which can offer a unique challenges in treatment efforts, one novel approach has been the creation {{of antibiotic}} cement nails which can be inserted into the infected bone. First described by Paley and Herzenberg [...] antibiotic cement nails have dual purpose, both of stabilization of the bone being treated, and prevention against post-procedure infection. Antibiotic cement nails are inserted during surgery, and are produced around the time of procedure using materials available in the operating room setting. Antibiotics are mixed in with cement filling then molded around a support <b>anchor,</b> often chest <b>tubes</b> are used to ensure proper molding. Chest tubes have the advantage of being cheap and ubiquitous and have been shown to have uniformity in the production of antibiotic cement nails. The antibiotics fill the voids within the cement matrix, and upon drying and setting can be inserted into the bone. The antibiotic has a direct contact with the area of infection and retains its properties in acting upon the infection. In addition to cement nails, antibiotic cement spacers have been used to treat and prevent osteomyelitis, and {{for a longer period of}} time. In producing the antibiotic cement material it is necessary to choose antibiotics that will be effective in this hybrid form, it has been found that antibiotics in powder form that are broad spectrum are of best use. There are recommendations for the amount of antibiotic that is used when mixing in with the cement, but industry wide guidelines have not been established.|$|R
