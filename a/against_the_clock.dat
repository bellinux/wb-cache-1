5|$|Sonic 3 {{includes}} a competitive mode: two players, controlling Sonic, Tails, or Knuckles the Echidna, race through one {{or all of}} five stages that do {{not appear in the}} main game. In these same stages, a single player can compete <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> in time attacks.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} four {{different}} game types: Championship, Race Practice, Time Trial, and Multi Player. In Championship, players {{compete in a}} league of seasons consisting of four races and, in Wrecking Racing, a Destruction Derby match. In Race Practice, players practise a race, while Time Trials consists of a race <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock.</b> Multi Player allows up to nine players to race individually. After all have finished, a league table showing their placings is displayed.|$|E
5|$|In Super Mario Kart, {{the player}} takes control {{of one of}} eight Mario series characters, each with differing capabilities. In single player mode players can race against {{computer-controlled}} characters in multi-race cups over three difficulty levels. During the races, offensive and speed boosting power-ups {{can be used to}} gain an advantage. Alternatively players can race <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> in a Time Trial mode. In multi-player mode two players can simultaneously take part in the cups or can race against each other one-on-one in Match Race mode. In a third multiplayer mode – Battle Mode – the aim is to defeat the other players by attacking them with power-ups, destroying balloons which surround each kart.|$|E
5000|$|Each solo team {{challenge}} is <b>against</b> <b>the</b> water <b>clock</b> (a clepsdyre) usually set at either 1:30, 2:00 or 2:30 minutes. Some games (such as Tightrope {{and nearly all}} duels) require a code to open the box containing the key, which is outside the room or nearby the other team members.

50|$|Bitterness {{over the}} {{defeat in the}} Falklands War {{triggered}} vandalism <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>clocks</b> at <b>the</b> time, and a dynamite explosion {{at the base of}} the tower, in November 1984 (though the monument sustained only minor damage). During the government of Mayor Fernando de la Rúa (1996-99), the tower underwent extensive restoration. Public access was restored and a glass lift to the 6th floor, utilising the original British machinery, was opened. The 6th floor features a small exhibition of elements of the original lift and a view over the district of Retiro, Retiro railway terminal and the Port of Buenos Aires; <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> pendulum is accessible on the 7th floor.|$|R
5|$|Light gun {{shooters}} primarily {{revolve around}} shooting {{large numbers of}} enemies attacking in waves. The protagonist {{may be required to}} defend himself by taking cover, or by shooting incoming thrown weapons, such as axes or grenades. The player may also compete <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock,</b> however, with some games also featuring boss battles. Games may also reward the player for accurate shooting, with extra points, power-ups or secrets. Games which do not pit the player against antagonists instead feature elaborate challenges constructed mainly from inanimate objects, testing the player's speed and accuracy. More conventional games may feature these types of challenges as minigames.|$|E
5|$|Many riders {{were named}} as contenders, {{including}} Ivan Basso, Levi Leipheimer, Armstrong, Damiano Cunego, Carlos Sastre, Gilberto Simoni, Danilo Di Luca, Marzio Bruseghin, and Denis Menchov. Before his collarbone injury, Armstrong {{was considered an}} overall favorite, {{and it was also}} noted that three time trials, including the insertion of an unusually long time trial mid-race, might favor him. Pre-race analysis noted that Armstrong, when on his best form, would be a rider very likely to gain from having such a long race <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> included in the Giro.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 Giro d'Italia {{began on}} 9 May, with Stage 11 {{occurring}} on 20 May. The first stage, {{like it had}} been since 2007, was a team time trial, a stage where each member of the team raced together <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock.</b> Like most cycling Grand Tours do, the beginning of the 2009 Giro included a string of flat stages that were contested by sprinters.

5|$|The climax {{takes place}} at the beauty pageant. After a frantic race <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> the family arrives at the hotel, and are curtly told by a pageant {{organizer}} that they are a couple minutes past the deadline. A sympathetic hired hand instead offers to register Olive on his own time. As Olive prepares for the pageant, the family sees Olive's competition: slim, hypersexualized pre-teen girls with teased hair and capped teeth. They wear lip gloss, adult-like swimsuits, and glamorous evening wear while performing highly elaborate dance numbers with great panache. It quickly becomes apparent that Olive (plain, chubby, wearing large eyeglasses, and untrained in beauty pageant conventions) is a mere amateur by comparison.|$|E

The ship is destroyed, but their plan works and the subspace parasites (which exist outside the normal space/time realm) are also destroyed by the implosion. The episode ends with the time-line reset; Archer is in sickbay recovering from a physical injury but will never develop the amnesia he originally suffered.|$|E

5|$|Plutonium was {{delivered}} to Los Alamos {{in the form of}} what was found to be a mixture of plutonium trifluoride (PuF3) and plutonium tetrafluoride (PuF4). Work with plutonium was carried out in gloveboxes for safety reasons. The metallurgists figured out how to purify the plutonium, and found that heating it to 250° allowed them to work it in the malleable γ phase. It was also found that alloying it with 3 percent gallium would stabilize it in the δ phase. When plutonium at last began to arrive in quantity from the Hanford Site in February 1945, they were ready for production. In a race <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock,</b> the metallurgists produced plutonium spheres for the Trinity nuclear test by July 23, 1945.|$|E
5|$|The World Rally Championship (WRC) is a {{rallying}} series administrated by Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motorsport's world governing body. The series currently consists of 13 three-day events driven on surfaces {{that range from}} gravel and tarmac to snow and ice. Each rally is split into 15–25 special stages, which are run <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> on closed roads. The WRC was formed from well-known and popular international rallies, most of which had previously {{been part of the}} European Rally Championship and/or the International Championship for Manufacturers; the series was first contested in 1973. The drivers' championship was first awarded in 1977 and 1978 as an FIA Cup for Drivers title, to Sandro Munari and Markku Alén, respectively. The first official world champion in rallying was Björn Waldegård in 1979.|$|E
5|$|The {{world is}} portrayed from a three-quarters {{overhead}} view. The player can adjust the game's viewable perspective with zoom and horizontal panning functions. Pop-up hints will guide the {{player in the}} early stages of the game, and other characters audibly encourage the player as each level wears on. The cheery soundtrack increases in tempo as the level's timer runs low. After completing a level, the player can return to explore without a time limit. By finding secrets and activating lights throughout the level, the player raises their score and final medal ranking. There are also secret levels hidden throughout the game, where the player completes objectives <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock.</b> The player can compete against a ghost copy of their previous path through a level. There are no settings to change the game's difficulty, and the game saves to both the game cartridge itself and external storage.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new clock tree {{synthesis}} method for semi-synchronous circuits.

5|$|In the {{campaign}} mode, {{the objective of}} each level is the acquisition of the Portal Gem, usually {{in the possession of}} the heroic guardian of the realm, although it is sometimes in the possession of a rival keeper. Whoever has the Portal Gem must be defeated, so Horny can enter and claim it. The final level involves defeating King Reginald, overlord of the entire realm of Harmonia. Some levels have more specific conditions relating to this goal: for example, there is one level in which the player races <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> to obtain the Portal Gem in the possession of a rival keeper before the heroes invade and try to do the same. If the heroes recover the Portal Gem, the player loses. Other game modes include My Pet Dungeon and Skirmish. In My Pet Dungeon, the player constructs a dungeon without campaign-style objectives, and can control if, when, and how heroes invade. Instead, there are criteria based on the dungeon composition and related activities, and there is no requirement to proceed to the next level on completion. Skirmish involves competing against computer-controlled rival keepers, and the player can customize conditions such as which rooms and spells are available. Multiplayer is supported over IPX and TCP/IP and is otherwise similar to Skirmish. A patch added elite creatures (stronger than their normal counterparts) to the latter three modes. Elite creatures are attracted by constructing rooms with very specific tile arrangements.|$|E
5|$|Sánchez rebounded to turn {{in another}} strong ride on Alpe d'Huez in stage 19. He, along with Contador and Pierre Rolland formed the leading group {{on the way up}} the climb. Contador, who had been riding out front much of the stage after an early attack, faded first and {{finished}} the day in third place. Rolland eventually rode away from Sánchez for the stage win, but Sánchez' second place on the day moved him up to seventh overall, and back into the mountains classification lead. Sánchez, as well as Contador, moved up a place in the stage 20 individual time trial. Damiano Cunego, who had been in fifth place and is considered a poor time trialist, had a bad race <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> even by his standards, losing two minutes to most of the race's top overall riders and more than three to the stage winner.

5|$|Though Evans was the {{stronger}} {{of the two}} <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock,</b> Schleck had surpassed expectations in the long time trial at the 2010 Tour de France, leading to speculation as to whether his 57-second cushion over the Australian could be sufficient for him to win the Tour. Evans rode {{one of the best}} time trials of his career, finishing in second place seven seconds off the pace of Tony Martin, the rider who was crowned world time trial champion later that year. Andy said of his and his brother's rides that they were probably the best time trials likewise of their respective careers, but they were no match for Evans' performance. The Australian was two and a half minutes better than both of them, taking the overall lead by {{a minute and a half}} with Andy slipping to second and Fränk to third. Since the Tour's final stage is traditionally mostly ceremonial save for a final sprint finish, the time trial effectively cemented the final overall standings. Andy took the positive from the result, saying he and his brother were both proud of each other for their efforts and were excited to stand on the podium together in Paris, even if neither of them was on the top step.|$|E
40|$|A {{software}} package {{has been developed}} to measure, monitor, and archive the performance of timing signals distributed in the NASA Deep Space Network. Timing signals are generated from a central master clock and distributed to over 100 users at distances up to 30 kilometers. The time offset due to internal distribution delays and time jitter with respect to <b>the</b> central master <b>clock</b> are critical for successful spacecraft navigation, radio science, and very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) applications. The instrument controller and operator interface software is written in LabView and runs on the Linux operating system. The software controls a commercial multiplexer to switch 120 separate timing signals to measure offset and jitter with a time-interval counter referenced to <b>the</b> master <b>clock.</b> <b>The</b> offset of each channel is displayed in histogram form, and "out of specification" alarms are sent to a central complex monitor and control system.

40|$|We {{cast the}} problem of {{combinatorial}} auction design in a Bayesian framework in order to incorporate prior information into the auction process and minimize the number of rounds to convergence. We first develop a generative model of agent valuations and market prices such that clearing prices become maximum a posteriori estimates given observed agent valuations. This generative model then forms {{the basis of an}} auction process which alternates between refining estimates of agent valuations and computing candidate clearing prices. We provide an implementation of the auction using assumed density filtering to estimate valuations and expectation maximization to compute prices. An empirical evaluation over a range of valuation domains demonstrates that our Bayesian auction mechanism is highly competitive <b>against</b> <b>the</b> combinatorial <b>clock</b> auction in terms of rounds to convergence, even under the most favorable choices of price increment for this baseline.

40|$|Antisera <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{circadian}} <b>clock</b> proteins Period (PER) and Timeless (TIM) {{were used}} to construct a detailed time course of PER and TIM expression and subcellular localization in {{a subset of the}} ventrolateral neurons (vLNs) in the Drosophila accessory medulla (AMe). These neurons, which express pigmentdispersing factor, {{play a central role in}} the control of behavioral rhythms. The data revealed several unexpected features of <b>the</b> circadian <b>clock</b> in Drosophila. First, TIM but not PER was restricted to the cytoplasm of vLNs throughout most of the early night. Second, the timing of TIM and PER nuclear accumulation was substantially different. Third, the two subsets of vLNs, the large and small vLNs, had a similar timing of PER nuclear accumulation but differed by 3 – 4 hr in the phase of TIM nuclear accumulation. These aspects of PER and TIM expression were not predicted by the current mechanistic model of <b>the</b> circadian <b>clock</b> in Drosophila and are inconsistent with the hypothesis that PER and TIM function as obligate heterodimers. The differing profiles of TIM and PER nuclear accumulation suggest that PER and TIM have distinct functions in the nuclei of vLNs. Key words: Period; Timeless; pigment-dispersing factor; circadian rhythm; Drosophila; lateral neurons; nuclear accumulation Transcriptional feedback loops are a common theme underlying circadian clocks from many different organisms (Dunlap, 1999).

40|$|SummaryPolyamines are {{essential}} polycations {{present in all}} living cells. Polyamine levels are maintained from the diet and de novo synthesis, and their decline with age is associated with various pathologies. Here we show that polyamine levels oscillate in a daily manner.

In turn, polyamines control the circadian period in cultured cells and animals by regulating the interaction between <b>the</b> core <b>clock</b> repressors PER 2 and CRY 1. Importantly, {{we found that the}} decline in polyamine levels with age in mice is associated with a longer circadian period that can be reversed upon polyamine supplementation in the diet.
