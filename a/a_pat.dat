Joyce's accountability and regret, and Galarraga's sportsmanship were widely praised for turning the unfortunate situation into a positive.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>PAT</b> is most {{commonly}} attempted from the two- or three-yard line, {{depending on the}} level of play. If scored by a placekick or dropkick through the goal posts, it is worth one point, and is typically called the extra point. Conversely, a team may elect to run a single play from scrimmage and attempt, once again, to achieve what would normally be considered a touchdown. In such a case, a successful attempt is called the two-point conversion and is worth two points. For the 2015 season, the NFL adopted a rules on PATs that stated during an extra point the placekick must be kicked at the 15-yard line and on extra points if the kick is blocked and the opposing team returns it into the end zone or if during a two-point conversion the ball is fumbled or intercepted and returned to the end zone the opposing team will score two points. No points are awarded on a failed extra point or two-point conversion attempt. In general, the extra point is almost always successful in professional play and is only slightly less successful at amateur levels, while the two-point conversion is a much riskier play with a higher probability of failure; accordingly, extra point attempts are far more common than two-point conversion attempts.|$|E

500|$|A {{report in}} The Field stated: [...] "The {{result was a}} more easy victory for Mr Spencer Gore than had been expected.". Third-placed Heathcote said that Gore was the best {{player of the year}} and had a varied service with a lot of twist on it. Gore, {{according}} to Heathcote, was a player with an aptitude for many games and had a long reach and a strong and flexible wrist. His volleying style was novel at the time, a forceful shot instead of merely <b>a</b> <b>pat</b> back over the net. All the opponents who were defeated by Gore {{on his way to the}} title were real tennis players. His victory was therefore regarded as a win of the rackets style of play over the real tennis style, and of the offensive style of the volley player – who comes to the net to force the point, over the baseline player – who plays groundstrokes from the back of the court, intent on keeping the ball in play. His volleying game was also successful because the height of the net at the post – 5ft (1.52 m) in contrast to the modern height of 3ft 6 in (1.07 m) – made it difficult for his opponents to pass him by driving the ball down the line. Gore indicated that the real tennis players had the tendency to play shots from corner to corner over the middle of the net and did so at such a height that made volleying easy.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{reported that}} [...] "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter" [...] was a [...] "stellar episode that was hitting {{all the right}} beats", and commented that [...] "ven the tired, formulaic structure of Jack's two women scenario was given some great new lines" [...] from Fey and Cannon, who developed the script. He opined that if the episode centered only around Jack's two women dilemma it [...] "would have been just fine." [...] Canning appreciated Elizabeth Banks' and Julianne Moore's appearances, writing that the two [...] "exhibited the charms that have made them welcome additions to this season". In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 9.2 out of 10 rating. Jane Boursaw of AOL's TV Squad said that the Toofer story was [...] "funny, without being (too) offensive." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin said that he enjoyed [...] "just about every minute" [...] of this episode, and praised Liz's speech citing it as the [...] "crowning moment" [...] from [...] "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter". Rabin also liked the Toofer quitting storyline writing that it [...] "could easily have gone nowhere but the show made it both funny and surprisingly thoughtful by {{using it as a}} springboard to discuss Affirmative Action and our society's defiantly uneven playing field." [...] Time contributor James Poniewozik noted that this episode was stronger than [...] "Khonani", which aired the same day of the week as this episode. Sean Gandert of Paste wrote that Toofer's plot was not [...] "given {{more than a few minutes}} of screen time [...] it also doesn't wear out its welcome... The show doesn't address race, gender, or affirmative action in a particularly enlightened manner, but who cares, it's funny." [...] TV Guides Adam Mersel wrote that he found the most enjoyment in Liz's story, writing that he found it [...] "endearing". In regards to Jack's plot, Mersel said that Jack is able to play off Nancy and Avery so well that [...] "I am going back and forth on whether or not to scold the NBC boss or give him <b>a</b> <b>pat</b> on the back. Avery and Nancy both have their shining moments, but I feel that he must choose quite soon, or he will be loosing [...] both." ...|$|E
