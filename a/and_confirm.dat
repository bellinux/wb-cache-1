Octavian has the clerics guard Amy while he, the Doctor, and River make for a secondary control room {{on the other side of}} the oxygen factory. During this, the Doctor learns that River is Octavian's prisoner, promised a full pardon if she helped capture the Angel. Octavian is killed by an Angel but this allows the Doctor and River to enter and secure the control room. They analyze the crack the Doctor saw <b>and</b> <b>confirm</b> that the leaking energy came from an explosion in time, and are able to narrow the date of the explosion's epicenter.|$|E

5|$|Bond and Amasova examine Stromberg's {{underwater}} Atlantis {{base from}} an American submarine, <b>and</b> <b>confirm</b> {{that he is}} operating the stolen tracking system. The Liparus captures the submarine. Stromberg sets his plan in motion: the simultaneous launching of nuclear missiles from British and Soviet submarines to destroy Moscow and New York City. This would trigger a global nuclear war, which Stromberg would survive in Atlantis, and subsequently a new civilisation would be established underwater. He leaves for Atlantis with Amasova. Bond escapes and frees the captured British, Russian and American sailors and they battle the Liparuss crew. Bond reprograms the submarines to fire missiles at each other, saving Moscow and New York City. The victorious submariners escape the sinking Liparus on the American submarine.|$|E
5|$|Fischer and {{co-workers}} also studied {{the chemistry of}} iridocene, the third transition series analogue of rhodocene and cobaltocene, finding the chemistry of rhodocene and iridocene are generally similar. The synthesis of numerous iridocenium salts including the tribromide and hexafluorophosphate have been described. Just as with rhodocene, iridocene dimerises at room temperature but a monomer form can be detected at low temperatures and in gas phase and IR, NMR, and ESR measurements indicate a chemical equilibrium is present <b>and</b> <b>confirm</b> the sandwich structure of the iridocene monomer. The complex , the analogue of rhodocene derivative reported by Fischer, has also been studied and demonstrates properties consistent with {{a greater degree of}} π-backbonding in iridium(I) systems than is found in the analogous cobalt(I) or rhodium(I) cases.|$|E

This came after Duc had arrived in I Corps earlier in the day with a message from the other plotters that Khánh was to be in Saigon to lead the coup on the day after. What Khánh had actually done was to send Wilson to Saigon earlier in the day to check with the embassy <b>and</b> <b>confirm</b> that Washington did support the coup.|$|E

5|$|The club {{continued}} to challenge for honours throughout the 1970s, finishing one point behind the league champions {{on two occasions}} and reaching {{the final of the}} 1974 League Cup. One of the matches from this period that is most fondly remembered by supporters of Manchester City is the final match of the 1973–74 season against arch-rivals Manchester United, who needed to win to have any hope of avoiding relegation. Former United player Denis Law scored with a backheel to give City a 1–0 win at Old Trafford <b>and</b> <b>confirm</b> the relegation of their rivals. The final trophy of the club's most successful period was won in 1976, when Newcastle United were beaten 2–1 in the League Cup final.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{philosophers}} of diverse orientations have challenged many of Fodor's ideas. For example, the language of thought hypothesis {{has been accused of}} either falling prey to an infinite regress or of being superfluous. Specifically, Simon Blackburn suggested in an article in 1984 that since Fodor explains the learning of natural languages as a process of formation and confirmation of hypotheses in the LOT, this leaves him open to the question of why the LOT itself should not be considered as just such a language which requires yet another and more fundamental representational substrate in which to form <b>and</b> <b>confirm</b> hypotheses so that the LOT itself can be learned. If natural language learning requires some representational substrate (the LOT) in order for it to be learned, why shouldn't the same be said for the LOT itself and then for the representational substrate of this representational substrate and so on, ad infinitum? On the other hand, if such a representational substrate is not required for the LOT, then why should it be required for the learning of natural languages? In this case, the LOT would be superfluous. Fodor, in response, argues that the LOT is unique in that it {{does not have to be}} learned via an antecedent language because it is innate.|$|E
5|$|Flower, Sun, and Rain {{forms the}} final {{part of an}} {{unofficial}} trilogy with Moonlight Syndrome, a spin-off of the Twilight Syndrome series Suda's final work for Human Entertainment, and The Silver Case. According to Suda, while they use the same setting and have some recurring characters, there is otherwise no connection. Despite acting as a sequel to The Silver Case, and featuring a version of that game's protagonist Sumio Kodai, the story was almost completely unrelated {{to the events of}} The Silver Case. This approach was inspired by the Star System utilized by manga artist Osamu Tezuka. The opening scene, where Mondo drives his car towards the island, was put into the game to both introduce Mondo's character to newcomers, and to throw players of The Silver Case off guard <b>and</b> <b>confirm</b> Mondo's two different identities in the two games. It also helped establish the setting and get the player used to Mondo's point of view. His portable computer Catherine, stored in a suitcase, was a reference to the events of The Silver Case due to earlier events being concentrated within it. Despite this, its silver color was coincidental rather than a deliberate reference to the previous game's title.|$|E

5|$|Upon investigation, {{the crew}} find that Worf's RNA has an unusual quantum {{signature}} <b>and</b> <b>confirm</b> {{that he is}} from a different universe. The crew theorizes that Worf, on his original return from the bat'leth tournament, passed through a time-space fissure, with the shuttlecraft's engines causing Worf to quantum flux between several parallel universes. Data determines that Worf's proximity to La Forge's VISOR caused Worf to shift between universes, and that each universe covers a different possibility. In effect, anything that could possibly happen has done so in a parallel universe, hence the believable changes in the reality that Worf is experiencing. The Enterprise returns {{to the location of}} the fissure, attempting to return Worf to his original universe. The Enterprise is then attacked by a Bajoran ship, which causes the fissure to destabilize and the various realities to merge, resulting in over 285,000 versions of the Enterprise appearing in the same area of space.|$|E
