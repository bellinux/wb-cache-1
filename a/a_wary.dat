The pudú is <b>a</b> <b>wary</b> animal that moves slowly and stops often, smelling the air for scents of predators. Being a {{proficient}} climber, jumper, and sprinter, the deer flees in a zigzag path when being pursued. The lifespan of the pudús ranges from 8 to 10years in the wild. The longest recorded lifespan is 15years and 9months. However, such longevity is rare and most pudús die at a much younger age, {{from a wide range}} of causes. Maternal neglect of newborns, as well as a wide range of diseases, can decrease the population. A popular rumor is that if alarmed to a high degree, pudús die from fear-induced cardiac complications.|$|E

5|$|The {{events of}} Arkham City are set {{one year after}} Batman: Arkham Asylum. Quincy Sharp, the asylum's {{erstwhile}} director, has taken sole credit for halting the Joker's armed siege, using this distinction to become mayor of Gotham City. Declaring both the asylum and Blackgate Penitentiary no longer suitable to contain the city's detainees, Sharp's administration orders both facilities closed and he purchases Gotham's most notorious slums, converting them into an immense prison enclosure known as Arkham City. This facility is subsequently placed {{in the care of}} psychiatrist Hugo Strange—who is secretly manipulating Sharp—and monitored by a rogue private military firm, TYGER Security. Strange permits the inmates to do as they please, so long as they do not attempt to escape. <b>A</b> <b>wary</b> Batman maintains his own vigil over the new project, concerned that the chaotic situation there will get out of hand. Meanwhile, the Joker is suffering from a potentially fatal disease caused by his previous consumption of the Titan formula, an unstable steroid serum which turns men into maddened monsters.|$|E

There was some relief when US doctors {{discovered that it}} affected not exclusively gays, but also Haitians and haemophiliacs. However, it caused some local homosexuals to cast <b>a</b> <b>wary</b> eye on Caucasians and promiscuous Singaporeans returning from Western countries. The possibility that it would become a problem here seemed remote at the time.|$|E

She faces another medical crisis when her health is compromised from {{the water in the}} bomb shelter, and again briefly lapses into a coma. Aidan proposes, but <b>a</b> <b>wary</b> Greenlee initially turns him down before accepting. Zach sends Aidan on a mission to Darfur to rescue a doctor, who turns out to be Jake Martin, again trapped in a war torn country. Greenlee and Aidan's relationship is tested when she reveals she no longer wants to have children, but Aidan is able to move past his insecurities.|$|E
25|$|Time has passed, and {{a heavily}} {{pregnant}} Dot visits George's studio. She {{asks for a}} painting George made of her, but he refuses. Jules and Yvonne come to the studio to see George's nearly finished painting. While Jules goes with George to see the painting, Yvonne and Dot hold <b>a</b> <b>wary</b> conversation. They realize they have both felt neglected by an artist, their mutual dislike fades, and they discuss the difficulties of trying to maintain a romantic relationship with an artist. Meanwhile, Jules is puzzled by George's new technique and concerned that his obsession with his work is alienating him from his fellow artists and collectors alike. He refuses to support the work. Jules and Yvonne leave, and George, having forgotten Dot was there, goes back to work. Dot reveals {{the real reason for}} her visit: despite the obvious fact that George fathered her unborn child, she and Louis are getting married and leaving for America. George angrily retreats behind his canvas, and she begs him to react, in some way, to her news. They argue bitterly about their failed relationship, and Dot concludes sadly that while George may be capable of self-fulfillment, she is not, and they must part ("We Do Not Belong Together").|$|E

After the charges of flip-flopping that marked his 2008 campaign began to accumulate again, Romney declared in November 2011: [...] "I've been as consistent as human beings can be." [...] In the final month before voting began, Newt Gingrich experienced a significant surge– taking a solid lead in national polls and most of the early caucus and primary states– before settling back into parity or worse with Romney following a barrage of negative ads from Restore Our Future, a pro-Romney Super PAC.|$|E

Trudeau obtained the majority against Stanfield that Pearson {{had never been able to}} obtain against Diefenbaker, as the PC party lost 25 seats, 20 of them in the West. The former Prime Minister, though stating, [...] "The Conservative Party has suffered a calamitous disaster" [...] in a CBC interview, could not conceal his delight at Stanfield's humiliation, and especially gloated at the defeat of Camp, who made an unsuccessful attempt to enter the Commons. Diefenbaker was easily returned for Prince Albert.|$|E
500|$|The small Republican {{majority}} in the Senate made Irreconcilable votes necessary to Lodge's strategy, and he met with Borah in April 1919, persuading him {{to go along with}} the plan of delay and reservations as the most likely to succeed, as it would allow the initial popular support for Wilson's proposal to diminish. Neither senator really liked or trusted the other, but they formed <b>a</b> <b>wary</b> pact to defeat the treaty. Lodge was also chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and he delayed the treaty by convening a lengthy series of hearings, presiding over a committee packed with Irreconcilables, including Borah. As these hearings continued in the summer of 1919, Wilson undertook a speaking tour by train to get the public to press the Senate for ratification, a tour that ended in his collapse. [...] In the months that followed, an ailing Wilson refused any compromise.|$|E

Care was taken, therefore, to ensure that the enterprise launched by the statute would be going before litigation could test it in the local federal courts, and § 14 (b) hopefully designated the District Court for the District of Columbia as the only forum in which suit attacking the statute on a broad front could be brought. Yet Congress, in trying to escape the clutches of hostile courts, did not avoid the precipitate embrace of a sympathetic one: the Supreme Court of the United States.

500|$|The dogfight {{developed}} over Poelkapelle at about 18:30 hours. The Germans chasing Voss found themselves stalemated by British Sopwith Camels, {{as well as}} some SPADs and Bristol F.2 Fighters patrolling under the overcast. Two flights of the elite 56 Squadron formed a lower layer of British patrols at 1,800meters (6,000feet) altitude. Below that, Lieutenant Harold A. Hamersley, flying as a rear guard to his squadronmates in 60 Squadron, had <b>a</b> <b>wary</b> eye on a nearby enemy formation of 20 to 25 German aircraft. At about 18:25 hours, he turned to help what he believed to be a Nieuport threatened by a German Albatros, firing a short burst of machine-gun fire to distract the German. The [...] "Nieuport", Voss's misidentified Fokker Triplane, rounded on Hamersley and raked him with Spandau fire. Hamersley flung his Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a into a spin that went inverted, with Voss continuing to fire, holing his wings and engine cowling. Lieutenant Robert L. Chidlaw-Roberts, a squadronmate of Hamersley, rushed to his aid. Within seconds, Voss shredded Chidlaw-Roberts's rudder bar, also driving him out of the fray into a forced landing.|$|E
500|$|Limbaugh's {{appearance}} in the episode has drawn both praise and criticism from news outlets, including Daniel Foster of National Review who commented, [...] "It is to Mr. Limbaugh's credit that he can make fun of himself. But Seth MacFarlane, the whiskey-soaked Dada creator of Family Guy, is responsible for more sophomoric cartooning than the combined patrons of America’s truck stop and dive bar bathrooms." [...] Foster went on to add, [...] "I can only look at the Limbaugh-MacFarlane mash-up with <b>a</b> <b>wary</b> eye." [...] Columnist Matt Lewis of Politics Daily also questioned Limbaugh's appearance on Family Guy, citing his support for former Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin, whose daughter, Bristol Palin, has openly criticized MacFarlane and called the show's writers [...] "heartless jerks." [...] In contrast, John Nolte of Andrew Breitbart's Big Hollywood wrote, [...] "What MacFarlane’s doing fits exactly into our template. He’s entitled to his opinion, {{worked very hard to}} reach the top of the most difficult business there is to succeed in, and in turn uses that forum to further his own agenda— that’s how it’s supposed to work. But {{at the same time he}} doesn’t completely shut us out." [...] Prior to the episode's official broadcast on television in the United States, Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post called Limbaugh's guest {{appearance in}} the episode [...] "genuinely funny," [...] and David Weigel of Slate commented, [...] "I'm not at all surprised that Limbaugh would embrace the show and answer its mockery of conservatives; the plotline [...] is a perfect conservative narrative." ...|$|E
