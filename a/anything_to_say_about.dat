5|$|Epaminondas was {{considered}} the greatest warrior-statesmen of ancient Thebes by many, including the Roman historian Diodorus Siculus. Diodorus does not have <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the sexual orientation of Epaminondas or the Sacred Band, nor does he {{say anything about the}} following account, again from Plutarch (Amatorius 17). According to Plutarch's dramatic dialogue, Epaminondas had two male lovers: Asopichus and Caphisodorus, the latter died with him at Mantineia in battle. They were buried together, something usually reserved for a husband and wife in Greek society.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{cautions}} that we cannot feel or intuit {{this world of}} the understanding. He also stresses that {{we are unable to}} make interesting positive claims about it because we are not able to experience the world of the understanding. Kant argues that we cannot use the notion of the world of the understanding to explain how freedom is possible or how pure reason could have <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> practical matters because we simply do not and cannot have a clear enough grasp of the world of the understanding. The notion of an intelligible world does point us towards the idea of a kingdom of ends, which is a useful and important idea. We just have {{to be careful not to}} get carried away and make claims that we are not entitled to.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked if}} the {{original}} author ever has <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> how their book is treated, Allen replied: [...] "Not if I can help it. You cannot open that can of worms. You sell your book, {{you go to the}} bank, you shut up." ...|$|E

2500|$|He was {{presented}} {{on camera in}} the morning of 13 September 2012, handcuffed and wearing a long-sleeve shirt. Ten bodyguards of Costilla Sánchez were also arrested during the operative. Ernesto Banda Chaires, one of the detainees, {{is believed to be the}} regional boss of the cartel in Tampico. In the Wednesday arrest, the Mexican authorities confiscated several assault rifles, pistols [...] encrusted with jewelry, and a number of expensive-looking watches. When asked if he had <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> his criminal charges and if he had a lawyer, Costilla Sánchez shook his head.|$|E
2500|$|Both as a rower {{and as a}} rowing coach, Courtney {{was known}} for his {{distinctive}} stroke. This style of rowing would become known as the Courtney Stroke. The most evident trait of the stroke is the positioning of the back. The back is always kept in a very straight position. Courtney is quoted as saying, [...] "No kink in the back if I have <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] He kept the back straight to allow the lungs to work without difficulty with no strain on the abdominal muscles. His idea was influenced by watching famous professional rower Harry Coulter in 1870 at Buffalo, New York.|$|E
2500|$|The {{economic}} situation in Denmark {{was one of}} high unemployment and poor housing, especially in Copenhagen. In the 1970s, the Copenhagen City Council, led by a social democratic mayor, Egon Weidekamp, had begun a process of rehousing for {{people living in the}} poor areas of Copenhagen. The process involved the demolition of large parts of the old boroughs surrounding the city center. Although the intent was to raise the standard of living for working-class people, the consequence was that the new houses often became too expensive for those very people to live in. Many found themselves temporarily relocated to elsewhere in the city, and when they wanted to return to their old homes, they found the rent to be too high for them to pay. [...] This gave rise to a growing anger towards the city council and a feeling amongst the poor people of Copenhagen that decisions concerning their lives were being made without them having <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it. The city's plans also left many old and worn, but still useful, buildings empty. [...] At the same time, {{a lot of young people}} were unemployed and without homes. All these factors opened the door to widespread squatting.|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked about}} a {{follow-ups}} to Nikita, Anne Parillaud spoke about being approached for a sequel, noting her lack of interest stating [...] "If the film was a failure, would you have had <b>anything</b> more <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> her?' No. Of course not." ...|$|R

I shouldn't care that Mr. Townsend should be a frequent topic of conversation, but whenever you have <b>anything</b> particular <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> him I shall be very glad to hear it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Several times, when we {{was writing}} the story," [...] said Pomona, [...] "I had {{a notion that}} Jone was trying to squeeze a moral into it here and there; but he didn't <b>say</b> nothing <b>about</b> it, and I didn't ask him, and if there's <b>anything</b> more <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it, it's {{for him to do}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|He laughed shrewdly. “Not {{as long as}} our old {{hunters have}} <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it. I’m {{dividing}} amongst them a dollar a skin for all the skins shot by our new hunters. At least half of their enthusiasm to-day was due to that. Oh, no, there won’t be any escaping if they have <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it. And now you’d better get for’ard to your hospital duties. There must be a full ward waiting for you.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Doctor Who: The Television Companions David Howe and Stephen Walker were unimpressed by the episode, {{stating that}} despite {{reasonable}} dialogue, effective sets and effects it was otherwise [...] "very difficult <b>to</b> find <b>anything</b> good <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> this story, which is undoubtedly the weakest {{of the second}} Doctor's era, if not of the sixties as a whole".|$|R
60|$|Then {{the great}} man paused, and Paul began to wonder whether it could be {{possible}} {{that he had been}} sent for to Grosvenor Square on a Sunday morning in order that he might be asked to dine in the same house a fortnight later.

5000|$|In 2006 Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad {{commented on}} the Saudi Arabian Embassy's Islamic Affairs Department {{distribution}} of [...] "The Noble Koran" [...] which included commentary that disparaged Jews and Christians. Ahmad told The Washington Post [...] "The outcry was so great...People were disgusted. And it wasn't just liberals. I couldn't find an American Muslim who had <b>anything</b> good <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> that edition. I would call it a Wahhabi Koran." ...|$|R

50|$|In an {{interview}} with Doctor Who Magazine, Padbury explained that she no longer appeared at Doctor Who conventions nor spoke about her time on the programme, as she felt she no longer had <b>anything</b> new <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> her time in the show.

6000|$|Francis {{recalled}} his extraordinary experience of that {{evening in the}} re-numbered room. 'My stay in Venice is uncertain,' he replied.

50|$|Haul videos rarely {{ever have}} <b>anything</b> {{negative}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the products. The rationale for those positive reviews {{is that the}} buyers wouldn't typically purchase something unless they really wanted it. Hence, the owners generally report positive experiences, after having selected which products to buy. This aspect of the genre of haul videos makes sponsorship by brand advertisers particularly appealing. Brands such as J.C. Penney reached out to haulers {{as part of their}} marketing efforts for Back To School 2010.|$|R
25|$|Fulgentius’s etymologies (while {{typical of}} his age) have been {{recently}} criticized as being extravagant, arbitrary, and often incorrect. While few have had <b>anything</b> positive <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> such etymological methods {{within the last}} two hundred years, the tradition {{dates back to the}} work of Plato and was common practice for such philosophic traditions as the Stoics and Neoplatonists. His use of such arbitrary etymologies to substantiate his allegorical claims is typical of his relentless tendency to stretch interpretations and search for truths that are not readily evident.|$|R

60|$|Mrs. Ashford {{was glad}} {{it was so}} good a connection, and {{obtained}} all the intelligence she could from James Thorndale, who spoke warmly of the Hollywell family in general; and, in particular, said that the young ladies looked after schools and poor people,--that Miss Edmonstone was very handsome and clever--a very superior person; but as to Miss Amabel, {{he did not know}} that there was <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> her.

60|$|Now, {{as soon as}} {{the first}} bewilderment was over, Captain Carton gave the order to land for the present. But this boat of his, with two hands left in her, {{immediately}} put off again when the men were out of her, and kept off, some yards from the shore. As she floated there, with the two hands gently backing water to keep her from going down the stream, this pretty little arbour attracted many eyes. None of the boat's crew, however, had <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it, except that it was the captain's fancy.|$|E
