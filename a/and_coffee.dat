40|$|Abstract Background Four {{analytical}} approaches {{were used}} to evaluate the aroma profile at key stages in roast <b>and</b> ground <b>coffee</b> brew preparation (concentration within the roast <b>and</b> ground <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> respective <b>coffee</b> brew; concentration in the headspace of the roast <b>and</b> ground <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> respective brew). Each method was evaluated by the analysis of 15 diverse key aroma compounds that were predefined by odour port analysis. Results Different methods offered complimentary results for the discrimination of products; the concentration in the coffee brew was found to be the least discriminatory and concentration in the headspace above the roast <b>and</b> ground <b>coffee</b> was shown to be most discriminatory. Conclusions All approaches should be taken into consideration when classifying roast <b>and</b> ground <b>coffee</b> especially for alignment to sensory perception and consumer insight data as all offer markedly different discrimination abilities due to the variation in volatility, hydrophobicity, air-water partition coefficient and other physicochemical parameters of the key aroma compounds present. </p...|$|R

Many provinces and islands were isolated after the storm, necessitating helicopter travel to be reached by national aid workers.

As a consequence many vessels avoided the mainland and Lord Howe Island experienced an increasing trade which peaked between 1855 and 1857. In 1851 about 16 people were living on the island.

5|$|In 2001, biologically active hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptides were {{isolated}} from tobacco which activated {{the production of}} protease inhibitors {{in a similar way}} to systemin in tomatoes. Although they are structurally unrelated to systemins, their similar function resulted in them being named hydroxyproline-rich systemins (HypSys). Following the initial discovery other HypSys peptides were found in tomato, Petunia and black nightshade. In 2007, HypSys were found outside the Solanaceae, in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and sequence analysis identified HypSys analogs in poplar (Populus trichocarpa) <b>and</b> <b>coffee</b> (Coffea canephora). Systemins are highly conserved between species, whereas HypSys are more divergent but all contain a conserved proline or hydroxyproline-rich central domain.|$|E
