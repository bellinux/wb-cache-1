500|$|Actor Raphael Sbarge became {{attracted}} {{to join the}} series because he would effectively be helping tell two stories, one in a fantasy world {{and the other in}} a modern setting. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Sbarge compared Once Upon a Time to the television series Lost [...] "in that they have a large ensemble and what they do is that they take a few characters <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> take them, effectively on a deep dive." [...] When Sbarge read the script for [...] "That Still Small Voice", he was worried about [...] "treading into people's imaginations," [...] but ultimately decided that [...] "they cast me for a reason because there are some qualities in me that they obviously recognize for the story they want to tell." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer and supervising {{producer}} Brad Kern {{reflected on}} the show's cancellation, saying, [...] "Ten years later, everybody you talk to... they all love the show. I {{think that was the}} biggest disappointment about the show not coming back. We knew we were doing something special." [...] Told of the show's success in the TV Guide [...] "Save Our Shows" [...] poll, Sandy Grushow said, [...] "Obviously I'm happy and not entirely surprised", but added, [...] "You can't dismiss a season's worth of ratings." [...] Kim Manners, director on {{nearly a third of the}} Brisco episodes, said working on the series gave him an opportunity to grow creatively. He told writer Joe Nazzaro, [...] "It really woke me up as a director, almost spiritually", and that directing for Brisco was a large contributing factor to his success as a regular director on The X-Files. Manners said, [...] "When they didn't give it a second year, I was devastated", adding that he wished Cuse would have made a feature film based on Brisco. Considering the show's short life, Cuse later commented, [...] "If the show could have survived into a second season, I think it could have ended up running for actually a long time. Some shows just sort of fall through the cracks in the right away <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> stay on the air long enough to aggregate an audience. I think if circumstances had been different, Brisco could have had a much longer life." [...] Cuse also said the Friday night time slot hurt Briscos chances of building an audience, saying, [...] "We were on at 8 p.m. on Friday night, which is sort of a death slot– I mean people do still go bowling– few shows have succeeded in that slot." ...|$|E
2500|$|Droste and Bear were {{subsequently}} joined by bass guitarist and producer Chris Taylor, and performed four shows {{together as a}} three-piece. Regarding these shows, Droste noted, [...] "We've never played without the four of us, really. The first couple shows we did before we knew Dan , we did with three of us <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> sucked. From the get-go, when {{we were trying to}} put together a live show, that's when we discovered our sound and that's why I think {{that was the beginning of}} the band." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to being influenced by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur’s famous stage play The Front Page, Howard studied old newspaper movies from the 1930s and 1940s. Howard said, “Every studio made them, <b>and</b> then <b>they</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> vanished. One of the reasons I thought {{it would make a}} good movie today is that it feels fresh and different.” ...|$|R
2500|$|The album wasn't {{written with}} a {{particular}} type of theme in mind. According to La Torre, [...] "Each song is its own animal." [...] However, in retrospect, it {{has been described as a}} [...] "rebirth" [...] by Wilton and Rockenfield, and as [...] "rising up and moving forward" [...] by La Torre. According to Wilton, this is because [...] "we were going through a lot tense situations <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> [...] into the lyrics a bit." [...] La Torre elaborated this, saying: [...] "It's just about moving forward, going through the trenches, and seeing a great light at the end of the other side." [...] He has also described the overall vibe of the record as [...] "turmoil and then coming out on the other side in a good way".|$|E

To Fashion Indie Magazine she said: [...] "I decided to put up this song on MySpace. [...] it was basically a [...] "diss track" [...] and I didn't expect anything out of it. It was just {{to make me feel}} good like how music usually do but Niles [...] came across to my page and was really into my voice <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> got me into singing and opened up my eyes to business opportunities". She dropped out of college in her first year to pursue her singing career and was then signed by the Los Angeles-based record label and management team, Indie-Pop, who also discovered The Cataracs.

5000|$|Middleton told Label Engine in January 2016 that [...] "I {{wanted to}} start the label early while I was still growing as an artist, as I felt like each {{business}} would grow side by side (Westwood and The Funk Hunters), <b>and</b> <b>they</b> could <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> help pull each other along, {{while at the same}} time helping to boost all the other music I would be releasing from friends on the label too." ...|$|R

5000|$|The Actual Tigers [...] "basically ended {{because there}} was some extreme {{frustration}} involved throughout the process of us being signed with Capitol Records, {{and then it was}} farmed out to another label called Nettwerk," [...] Seely said in 2005. [...] "Capitol was supposed to help out with that <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> dropped the ball, and we were at the point in our lives where some guys wanted to do things that actually made money besides music. So I decided to keep churning out the hits. And that's what is embodied on Funeral Music." ...|$|E

5000|$|Many fans {{felt that}} the sexual nature of Xena and Gabrielle's {{relationship}} was cemented by an interview given by Lucy Lawless to Lesbian News magazine in 2003. Lawless stated that after the series finale, where Gabrielle revives Xena with a mouth-to-mouth water transfer filmed {{to look like a}} full kiss, she had come to believe that Xena and Gabrielle's relationship was [...] "definitely gay". [...] "There was always a, 'Well, she might be or she might not be' but when there was that drip of water passing between their lips in the very final scene, that cemented it for me. Now it wasn't just that Xena was bisexual and kinda liked her gal pal <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> fooled around sometimes, it was 'Nope, they're married, man'." ...|$|E

5000|$|On September 23, 2016 Tiger Lou {{released}} {{their fourth}} studio album titled, [...] "The Wound Dresser".

It just quite quickly became pretty apparent that's what we were doing as well in a lot of ways. So it just feels like a natural theme.

5000|$|Williams is an ideas-driven author: {{the idea}} comes first. “Usually {{for me the}} trigger is an idea more than a {{character}} or a title. The Bobby Dollar book idea was ‘cold war,’ the Otherland idea was ‘river that links different virtual worlds together,’ the Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn idea was ‘after a King-Arthur-type Great King dies.’ Then they sort of find their own characters and titles. (Well, I help.)” In an interview with Heiner Wittmann for Klett-Cotta, Williams explains, “Almost every book starts out as {{maybe one or two}} or three small ideas <b>and</b> then <b>they</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> go into the mix and I wait. <b>And</b> if <b>they</b> last, if they survive for awhile, they begin to agglomerate with other ideas.

5000|$|There was an {{extraordinary}} amount of tension at the start of that tour ... It just got off to a negative start. It was definitely much darker than any Led Zeppelin tour ever before that time ... The kind of people they had around them had deepened into some really criminal types. I think Richard Cole and perhaps some of the band and everybody around the band was so far into drugs at that point, that the drugs turned on them. They still had their moments of greatness (but) some of the shows were grinding and not very inspired ... The Bindon brothers were the thugs that were friends of Peter Grant's and were on this whole tour as security guards. <b>And</b> <b>they</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> brought an element of darkness into this thing.|$|E
5000|$|I {{set off to}} {{investigate}} this story {{with the idea of}} doing it as a drama, and gradually I realized that something completely different was developing. Where I traveled through the Arab world, the story was celebrated. Everyone had their own version of that story, all very, very different. ... Whoever I spoke to—whether they were Palestinians, whether they were conservative Saudis, whether they were radicals—they attached themselves to this princess. She'd become a myth. And they identified with her, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> co-opted her to their cause. People were discussing things with me about their private lives, about their sexual feelings, about their political frustrations, that they'd never discussed with me before. ...Somehow this princess was sort of like a catalyst.
