25|$|Although {{this is not}} too {{important}} for the normal distribution (the location and scale are estimated by the mean <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation,</b> respectively), it can be useful for many other distributions.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} method {{of establishing a}} reference range with the assumption of log-normal distribution {{is to use the}} arithmetic mean and arithmetic value of standard deviation. This is somewhat more tedious to perform, but may be useful for example in cases where a study that establishes a reference range presents only the arithmetic mean <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation,</b> leaving out the source data. If the original assumption of arithmetically normal distribution is shown to be less appropriate than the log-normal one, then, using the arithmetic mean <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> may be the only available parameters to correct the reference range.|$|E
30|$|Table 2 {{summarizes}} {{descriptive statistics}} (means <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations)</b> for the DMUs. Means <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> differed considerably {{depending on whether}} or not Prague was included. This was also true for Brno, but the difference was not as large. For this reason, we decided to calculate the models for all three cases – all DMUs, all DMUs except Prague, and all DMUs except Prague and Brno.|$|R

25|$|Analyses {{have been}} made {{of some of the}} {{relationships}} between the mean, median, mode <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation.</b> and these relationships place some restrictions of the sign and magnitude of the nonparametric skew.|$|E

25|$|In statistics, {{measures}} of central tendency and statistical dispersion, {{such as the}} mean, median, <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation,</b> are {{defined in terms of}} L'p metrics, and {{measures of}} central tendency can be characterized as solutions to variational problems.|$|E
30|$|Descriptive statistics, {{including}} {{mean values}} <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations,</b> {{were calculated for}} the continuous parameters using SPSS software (ver. 17.0; SPSS Inc., Munich, Germany).|$|R

30|$|All the {{measures}} were taken {{as the average}} of minimum three biological and analytical replicates from different test samples, <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> were calculated.|$|R
25|$|Where {{there are}} {{a large number of}} samples a quick {{reasonable}} estimate of the mean <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> can be got by grouping the samples into classes using equal size ranges. This introduces a quantization error but is normally accurate enough for most purposes if 10 or more classes are used.|$|E
25|$|This is {{an analog}} {{of the mean}} {{difference}} - {{the average of the}} differences of all the possible pairs of variate values, taken regardless of sign. The mean difference differs from the mean <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> because it is dependent on the spread of the variate values among themselves and not on the deviations from some central value.|$|E
25|$|Ideally, statisticians compile {{data about}} the entire {{population}} (an operation called census). This may be organized by governmental statistical institutes. Descriptive statistics {{can be used to}} summarize the population data. Numerical descriptors include mean <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> for continuous data types (like income), while frequency and percentage are more useful in terms of describing categorical data (like race).|$|E

25|$|In {{statistics}} {{the assumed}} mean {{is a method}} for calculating the arithmetic mean <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of a data set. It simplifies calculating accurate values by hand. Its interest today is chiefly historical {{but it can be}} used to quickly estimate these statistics. There are other rapid calculation methods which are more suited for computers which also ensure more accurate results than the obvious methods.|$|E
25|$|On the one hand, {{this makes}} it {{incorrect}} to apply traditional statistics {{that are based on}} variance <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> (such as regression analysis). On the other hand, this also allows for cost-efficient interventions. For example, given that car exhaust is distributed according to a power-law among cars (very few cars contribute to most contamination) it would be sufficient to eliminate those very few cars from the road to reduce total exhaust substantially.|$|E
25|$|A {{method to}} {{estimate}} the reference range for a parameter with log-normal distribution is to logarithmize all the measurements with an arbitrary base (for example e), derive the mean <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of these logarithms, determine the logarithms located (for a 95% prediction interval) 1.96 standard deviations below and above that mean, and subsequently exponentiate using those two logarithms as exponents and using the same base as was used in logarithmizing, with the two resultant values being the lower and upper limit of the 95% prediction interval.|$|E
40|$|We use data on {{ten years}} of {{entering}} students at Reed College to test for peer effects among classmates in a required freshman class. Assignment of students to class sections is effectively random, allowing us to avoid statistical problems that often make testing for peer effects impossible. We find evidence of nonlinear effects {{of the distribution of}} classmate abilities on student achievement. Students in sections with high mean <b>and</b> low <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> or low mean <b>and</b> high <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of ability do well in their subsequent studies.

25|$|For this equation, the {{differences}} between all pairs must be calculated. The pairs are either one person's pre-test and post-test scores or between pairs of persons matched into meaningful groups (for instance drawn from the same family or age group: see table). The average (XD) <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> (sD) of those differences {{are used in the}} equation. The constant μ0 is non-zero if you want to test whether the average of the difference is significantly different from μ0. The degree of freedom used is n−1, where n represents the number of pairs.|$|E
25|$|Divergence Angle: The {{representative}} {{range of}} leeway angles for {{a category of}} leeway objects. It can be calculated by obtaining the net leeway angle over time for a specific leeway object’s drift trajectory, and then averaging again {{for a series of}} leeway drift trajectories of a number of leeway objects in a leeway category, to determine the mean leeway angle <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of the leeway angle for the category. Divergence angle is then calculated as twice the standard deviation of the leeway angle, or mean plus one standard deviation of the leeway angle, or mean plus two standard deviations of the leeway angle depending on the particular study.|$|E
