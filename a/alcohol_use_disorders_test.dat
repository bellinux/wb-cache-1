40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the properties of}} the <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders</b> identification <b>test</b> in screening primary care attenders for alcohol problems. DESIGN: A validity study among consecutive primary care attenders aged 18 - 65 years. Every third subject completed the <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders</b> identification <b>test</b> (a 10 item self report questionnaire on alcohol intake and related problems) and was interviewed by an investigator with the composite international diagnostic interview <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> module (a standardised interview for the independent assessment of alcohol intake and related disorders). SETTING: 10 primary care clinics in Verona, north eastern Italy. PATIENTS: 500 subjects were approached and 482 (96. 4 %) completed evaluation. RESULTS: When the <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders</b> identification <b>test</b> was <b>used</b> to detect subjects with alcohol problems the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0. 95. The cut off score of 5 was associated with a sensitivity of 0. 84, a specificity of 0. 90, and a positive predictive value of 0. 60. The screening ability of the total score derived from summing the responses to the five items minimising the probability of misclassification between subjects with and without alcohol problems provided an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0. 93. A score of 5 or more on the five items was associated with a sensitivity of 0. 79, a specificity of 0. 95, and a positive predictive value of 0. 73. CONCLUSIONS: The <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders</b> identification <b>test</b> performs well in detecting subjects with formal alcohol disorders and those with hazardous <b>alcohol</b> intake. <b>Using</b> five of the 10 items on the questionnaire gives reasonable accuracy, and these are recommended as questions of choice to screen patients for alcohol problems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Aims: (i) To {{evaluate}} {{the prevalence of}} <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders,</b> and at risk-drinking among outpatients admitted to the Division of Psychiatry, University of Cagliari, Italy, for mood disorders, and (ii) to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the questionnaires used. Methods: Fifty-six patients affected by mood disorders answered to the questions of (i) The NIAAA Guide for identification of at-risk drinking, (ii) AUDIT questionnaire, (iii) The CAGE questionnaire and, (iv) SCID-I application forms for mood and <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders.</b> Results: Fourteen subjects (25 %) met the criteria for <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders</b> according to SCID-I; 17 (30. 4 %) achieved a score 1 in CAGE questionnaire; 12 (21. 4 %) reached AUDIT scores of 8 and 4 for men and women, respectively; 12 (21. 4 %) provided positive answers to NIAAA Guide. Despite these prevalence rates, no diagnosis of <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders</b> had previously been registered in their medical records. The CAGE questionnaire achieved the highest values of sensitivity and specificity in detecting <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders</b> <b>tested</b> against that of the SCID-I. Conclusions: <b>Alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders</b> and at-risk drinking are frequent in patients affected by mood disorders, although often underestimated; this underestimation was virtually absolute in the sample of patients investigated.

40|$|Abstract — Aims: To {{evaluate}} {{the number of}} subjects with possible <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders</b> (SPAUD) among primary care patients in Cagliari, Sardinia, Italy, {{by means of the}} self-administration of <b>Alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorder</b> identification <b>test</b> (AUDIT) and CAGE questionnaires. Methods: 939 patients waiting in 10 surgeries of primary care physicians were asked {{to take part in the}} study. A sample of 309 women and 197 men (total 506), aged between 18 and 65 years, agreed to participate and completed both questionnaires. SPAUD were defined as those achieving cut-off scores of 5 for AUDIT and/or 1 for CAGE. Results: Seventy-nine (15. 61 %) patients were SPAUD, achieving a positive score in at least one questionnaire. Fifty-six (11. 07 %) and forty-six (9. 09 %) patients yielded positive results with AUDIT and CAGE, respectively. Twenty-three (4. 55 %) patients were positive at both AUDIT and CAGE. Significantly higher proportions of men than women were recorded among SPAUD.

40|$|Abstract — Aims: To {{assess the}} psychometric {{structure}} and {{construct validity of}} the <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorder</b> identification <b>test</b> (AUDIT) in a Great Britain population sample. Methods: A stratified multi-stage random sample of 7849 participants completed the AUDIT as part of a computer assisted interview. Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted testing one to three factor models. The factors in these models were correlated with demographic variables and scores relating to perceived wellbeing, verbal IQ, and neurotic and psychosis symptoms to assess {{construct validity of the}} factor solutions. Results: A two factor solution was deemed to appropriately fit the data, measuring alcohol consumption and alcohol related problems. Correlations between the two factors on demographic, wellbeing, neurosis and psychosis symptomology were significantly different. Conclusions: The two factor solution suggests an advantage to investigating factor specific cut off scores for both consumption and alcohol related problems given their difference in predictive validity on both health and demographic variables. The <b>Alcohol</b> <b>Use</b> <b>Disorder</b> Identification Test (AUDIT) was designed as a brief screening instrument to detect hazardous drinking behaviours in the past year (Reinert and Allen, 2002).

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to identify the alcohol consumption among hepatitis C-positive people receiving opioid maintenance therapy using self-report and biomarkers. A total of 49 people (28 male, 21 female) were hepatitis C virus (HCV) positive and were included. The <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorder</b> identification <b>test</b> (AUDIT) and self-reported ethanol intake in the last 28 days were assessed. In addition to gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GGT) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and ethyl sulphate (EtS) were determined in serum and urine (UEtG, UEtS, SEtG) using liquid chromatography/tandem mass-spectroscopy (LC/MS-MS) with deuterated internal standards. Abstinence from alcohol was reported for the last 28 days by 13 participants and for the last 7 days by 22. AUDIT was 0. 001), with the direct ethanol metabolites and MCV. In this population, abstinence and episodic heavy drinking are more common than in the general population. Episodic heavy drinking is a significant cause of acute risk in this population. Results from biomarker testing could indicate cases of under- as well as over-reporting of alcohol consumption. Further research on the diagnostic accuracy of direct ethanol metabolites, including the use of phosphatidylethanol (PEth), in this setting is needed...|$|R
40|$|Treatment-seeking {{patients}} (N = 233) {{were recruited}} {{as they started}} a course of relapse prevention and coping with depression. The mean Beck depression inventory (BDI-II) score was 26 points, indicating a moderate degree of depression. The sample was recruited from different outpatient clinics and screened for alcohol-related problems with the <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders</b> identification <b>test</b> (AUDIT). Almost half {{of the total sample}} had a score on AUDIT > 8 indicating an alcohol problem. The participants in this study did not undergo a clinical interview to check out if their symptoms, as assessed with BDI-II and AUDIT, were part of a formal diagnosis in accordance with the criteria in ICD 10 or DSM IV. A specific instrument, perceived uncontrollability of depression (UNCONTROL), was used to measure the persons’ perceived control of depressive symptoms; a set of statements about coping with depressive symptoms where high scores indicate lack of coping with the symptoms. Alcohol problems were not found to be significantly associated with the perceived control of ongoing depressive symptoms and did not moderate the relationship between depressive symptoms and the perceived control of depressive symptoms.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{construct}} a structural equation model (SEM) that would describe the binge drinking among Korean undergraduate students. Methods: Model construction was based on the theory of planned behavior and prototype/willingness model, using the variables; intention, attitude, descriptive norm, and prototype perception of binge drinking, <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders</b> identification <b>test</b> (AUDIT), and binge drinking behavior. The analysis of data was done with both SPSS 20. 0 for descriptive statistics and AMOS 20. 0 for SEM. Results: The binge drinking intention was found to have a significantly direct effect in influencing binge drinking behavior. In addition, attitude, descriptive norm, and prototype perception of binge drinking were found to have a significantly direct effect in influencing binge drinking intention.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the psychometric {{analysis of the}} <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders</b> identification <b>test</b> (AUDIT) after it was modified for use in Hong Kong and administered to examine the patterns of hazardous and harmful drinking. The modified version of AUDIT was an 18 -item instrument in which 10 items were completely adopted from the original version and 8 items were added to improve its cultural sensitivity. It was translated into Chinese and back translation was undertaken to confirm the equivalence of the Chinese and English versions. Following a pilot study the instrument was administered to 450 subjects who were recruited from two acute general hospitals, a University Health Clinic and three community health centres. The content validity was judged as adequate {{by a panel of}} five international and local experts and the instrument achieved a high reliability coefficient of 0. 99 during a test–retest procedure conducted with 20 subjects.

40|$|Although {{self-esteem}} {{is related to}} problematic drinking, the mechanisms by which it affects drinking remain unclear. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether coping mechanisms mediate the relationship between self-esteem and problematic drinking among Chinese men and women with <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders</b> and to recommend appropriate interventions for drinking problems. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China. A sample of 5, 689 community residents was screened, and 517 male and 172 female problematic drinkers were chosen to participate in this study. A self-esteem scale, a coping questionnaire and an <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorder</b> identification <b>test</b> were completed in order to assess participants' self-esteem, coping mechanisms and <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders,</b> respectively. Participants' socio-demographic data were also gathered at this stage. The resulting data were examined via descriptive statistics, correlations and bootstrap analyses. Lower self-esteem levels were related to problematic drinking, and there were no gender differences in the relationship between self-esteem and problematic drinking. A relationship between low self-esteem and negative coping was observed only in men. Negative coping thus mediated the relationship between self-esteem and problematic drinking among men, but this was not the case for women. Positive coping did not mediate the relationship between self-esteem and problematic drinking among the participants, regardless of gender. Self-esteem and coping strategies are correlated among problematic drinkers. In addition, there are gender differences in the manners in which negative coping mediates the relationship between self-esteem and problematic drinking. Problematic drinking interventions directed at males should simultaneously address low self-esteem and negative coping...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Aims: To {{generate}} {{and pilot}} unfinished sentences, {{based on the}} Hayling Task of disinhibition, which could be com-pleted with alcohol or non-alcohol words. To determine whether drinking habits influenced responses on the new sentences, which may advance understanding of the cognitive processes underlying alcohol-related behaviours. Methods: Three phases: I—Generation of appropriate sentences (via email correspondence); II—Sentence completion to establish proportion of alcohol-related and non-alcohol-related responses; III—A Hayling-style task using the sentences (laboratory-based). During the Hayling task, sentences were completed with the first word {{that came to mind}} (initiation task), and with a word that did not make semantic sense (inhibition task). In Phase III, the <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorder</b> identification <b>test</b> (AUDIT) was also completed to determine whether drinking habits were related to responses. Results: Fifteen sentences were generated and tested. Compared with low hazardous drinkers, higher hazardous drinkers gave more alcohol-related responses; persisted in giving alcohol responses in the inhibition task; and were slower to make non-alcohol-related responses. A positive correlation was found between AUDIT score and number of alcohol-related responses. Conclusions: A new alcohol-related sentence-completion tool, based upon the Hayling disinhibition task, was developed and piloted. Responses on the task were associated with measures of <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders.</b> The task can be used in research investigating the processes underlying the acute and chronic effects of alcohol, such as attentional bias and disinhibition. In future, the task could be used in conjunction with non-alcohol-related sentence completion tasks to investigate general and alcohol-specific processes of disinhibition...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{emerging}} {{evidence that there}} is a spectrum of expression of bipolar <b>disorder.</b> This paper <b>uses</b> the well-established patterns of comorbidity of mood and <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorder</b> to <b>test</b> the hypothesis that application of an expanded concept of bipolar-II (BP-II) disorder might largely explain the association of <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders</b> (AUD) with major depressive disorder (MDD). METHOD: Data from the Zurich study, a community cohort assessed over 6 waves from ages 20 / 21 to 40 / 41, were used to investigate the comorbidity between mood disorders and AUD. Systematic diagnostic criteria were <b>used</b> for <b>alcohol</b> abuse, alcohol dependence, MDD, and BP-II. In addition to DSM criteria, two increasingly broad definitions of BP-II were employed. RESULTS: There was substantially greater comorbidity for the BP-II compared to major depression and for alcohol dependence compared to alcohol abuse. The broadest concept of BP-II explained two thirds of all cases of comorbidity of AUD with major depressive episodes (MDE). In fact, the broader the definition of BP-II applied, the smaller was the association of AUD with MDD, up to non-significance. In the majority of cases, the onset of bipolar manifestations preceded that of drinking problems by at least 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: The findings that the comorbidity of mood disorders with AUD was primarily attributable to BP-II rather than MDD and that bipolar symptoms usually preceded alcohol problems may encourage new approaches to prevention and treatment of AUD...|$|R
40|$|Studies of linkage and {{association}} in various ethnic populations have revealed many predisposing genes of multiple neurotransmitter systems for <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders</b> (AUD). However, evidence often is contradictory regarding {{the contribution of}} most candidate genes to the susceptibility of AUD. We, therefore, performed a case-control study to investigate the possible associations of genes selected from multiple neurotransmitter systems with AUD in a homogeneous Tibetan community population in China. AUD cases (N = 281) with an <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorder</b> identification <b>test</b> (AUDIT) score $ 10, as well as healthy controls (N = 277) with an AUDIT score # 5, were recruited. All participants were genotyped for 366 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 34 genes selected from those involved in neurotransmitter systems. Association analyses were performed using PLINK version 1. 07 software. Allelic analyses before adjustment for multiple tests showed that 15 polymorphisms within seven genes were associated with AUD (p, 0. 05). After adjustment {{for the number of}} SNPs genotyped within each gene, only the association of a single marker (rs 10044881) in HTR 4 remained statistically significant. Haplotype analysis for two SNPs in HTR 4 (rs 17777298 and rs 10044881) showed that the haplotype AG was significantly associated with the protective effect for AUD. In conclusion, the present study discovered that the HTR 4 gene may play a marked role in the pathogenesis of AUD. In addition, this Tibetan population sample marginally replicate...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Aims: Alcohol {{consumption}} is often under-reported in patients admitted to general hospitals with acute illness. For alcohol-dependent individuals hospital admission {{results in an}} enforced period of abstinence with potential alcohol withdrawal symp-toms, and possible life threatening complications. Early detection of <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> is therefore beneficial to patients and health services. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the performance of the <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders</b> identification <b>test</b> (AUDIT) questionnaire in the acute medical setting, and the effect of combining routine biological markers—glutamyltransferase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) on its performance in the early identification of in-patients with <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders</b> and at risk of developing symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Methods: Prospective study in consecutive patients admitted to an acute medical admissions ward. All patients were screened using the AUDIT questionnaire and routine blood tests. Patients were then monitored for symptoms of withdrawal using clinical institute withdrawal assessment for alcohol (CIWA-Ar). Results: Of the 874 patients screened using the AUDIT, 98 (11 %) screened positive of whom 17 (2 % of the 874) experienced clinically significant alcohol withdrawal symptoms, when using serial CIWA-Ar. The AUDIT and serial CIWA-Ar detected all patients who went on to manifest acute withdrawal symptoms.

40|$|BACKGROUND Comorbidity of bipolar <b>disorder</b> and {{substance}} <b>use</b> <b>disorder</b> is common. It {{is difficult to}} treat bipolar disorder patients with comorbid <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorder</b> since the disease course is more severe and they have greater difficulties in cognitive functions than those without <b>alcohol</b> <b>use.</b> Whether <b>alcohol</b> negatively affects specific cognitive functions or the deficits are more diffuse in nature is unclear. Alcoholic bipolar patients present with high scores in openness to experience and neuroticism personality traits. Personality to an extent mediates the co-occurrence of substance <b>use</b> in bipolar <b>disorder.</b> Thus, identifying these personality traits in bipolar or substance <b>use</b> <b>disorder</b> patients, will help us to prevent the co-occurrence of the second disorder. The aim {{of the study is}} to evaluate the clinical characteristics, personality traits and cognitive functions of patients with bipolar and comorbid <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS A sample of 100 patients, 50 with bipolar and <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorder</b> (cases) and 50 with bipolar disorder (controls) attending tertiary care hospital outpatient department at Chennai was selected. Alcohol status was assessed <b>using</b> AUDIT (<b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorder</b> identification <b>test)</b> and SADQ (severity of alcohol dependence questionnaire). Personality was assessed using NEO-five factor inventory. Cognition was assessed using frontal lobe assessment battery, Stroop test, DSST (digit symbol substitution test) and verbal N back test. RESULTS The cases group had more number of hospitalisations and mixed episodes than control group. They also performed poorer on frontal lobe assessment battery, Stroop test and digit symbol substitution test. Duration of <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> was associated positively with total number of hospitalisations and number of episodes. The cases group scored significantly higher on the personality traits of neuroticism and openness to experience. CONCLUSION The study confirmed the higher prevalence of neuroticism and openness to experience personality traits in bipolar with <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders.</b> The number of hospitalisations and mixed episodes were increased when both the illness coexisted. This also increased the deficits in executive functions, response inhibition and processing speed in bipolar patients with comorbid <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders...</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{identify}} variables {{associated with}} common mental disorders in an Australian university population. Methods: We invited all Australia-based {{students from a}} large public university (N = 24, 209) {{to participate in a}} web-based student mental health survey. Outcome measures included the patient health questionnaire depression, anxiety, and eating disorders modules, and the <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders</b> identification <b>test.</b> Explanatory variables of interest included gender, age, year of study, degree type, financial means, parental education, domestic/international status, and sexual orientation. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to estimate independent associations with the four outcomes. Results: Complete responses were received from 6, 044 students (25 %). Proportions reporting depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and harmful drinking were 8, 13, 14, and 8 %, respectively, while 30 % had {{at least one of these}} disorders. The groups with the highest rates of disorder were women, 25 – 34 -year-olds, students on low income, and homosexual or bisexual students. Parental education was not associated with disorder, nor was international/domestic status. Conclusion: This is the first study examining mental disorders in a population-based sample of university students in Australia. Given increasing student numbers and participation of students from lower socio-economic backgrounds, policy is urgently needed to promote better mental health in this population, to routinely identify vulnerable students, and to intervene early.

40|$|There {{has been}} little {{research}} examining the <b>use</b> of the <b>Alcohol</b> <b>Use</b> <b>Disorders</b> Identification <b>test</b> (AUDIT) as a workplace screening tool. In {{the current study a}} large scale sample (n = 4193) of police personnel completed the 10 AUDIT questions and two readiness to change questions. The sample represented 67 % of all members of an Australian State Police organisation. Analysis of AUDIT scores showed that 65 % of the sample scored in the low risk of hazardous alcohol consumption range, 32 % (33 % of males and 24 % of females) scored in the at risk for harmful alcohol consumption range and 3 % scored in the range indicating risk of alcohol dependence. Age emerged as a clear risk factor of hazardous drinking patterns. The 18 to 25 years age group recorded higher average alcohol consumption, higher rates of risk of abnormal drinking behaviour, higher rates of adverse consequences from drinking alcohol and higher total AUDIT scores than other age groups. This was consistent for both males and females. Of those scoring in the at risk range, 72. 5 % reported {{that they did not have}} a drinking problem.

40|$|Background: Offspring of {{individuals}} with <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders</b> {{have been shown to}} have elevated risk for mental health problems. Objectives: To examine the association between maternal problem drinking and child mental health as assessed by three informants in three European countries. Methods: Data were drawn from the School Child Mental Health in Europe study. Maternal <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> was assessed <b>using</b> the <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders</b> identification <b>test.</b> Child mental health was assessed using the mother and teacher versions of the strengths and difficulties questionnaire, and the child self-reported Dominic interactive. Analyses were performed on 2, 678 individuals, 6 - 11 &#x 00 A 0;year olds. Results: Adjusting for variables associated with maternal drinking, among children eight years old or younger, excessive drinking was not significantly associated with mental health problems, whether reported by the mother, teacher or by the child. However, among girls eight years old and above, problem drinking was associated with conduct problems as reported by the mother (OR = 4. 19), teacher reported total difficulties (OR = 4. 69), and peer relationship problems (OR = 8. 86). It was also associated with the presence of any child-reported disorder (OR = 3. 88), externalizing (OR = 5. 55) and internalizing disorders (OR = 4. 42). Conclusions/Importance: Adjusting for sociodemographic variables and for psychological distress, maternal problem drinking was not significantly associated with child mental health problems in boys or in girls ages six to eight.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine prospectively {{examined}} predictors of relapse in alcohol dependence with comorbid affective disorder. One hundred and eighty-three unipolar depressed or bipolar alcoholics who completed an integrated inpatient treatment programme for dual diagnosis were assessed at baseline, post-treatment discharge and at 3 and 6 months post treatment. Backwards stepwise likelihood ratio multiple logistic regression was used to investigate the impact of multiple covariates on relapse to alcohol in the 0 - 3 - and 3 - 6 -month period post discharge. The retention rate at 3 months post discharge was 95. 3 % (177 patients) and at 6 months it was 87. 4 % (162 patients). Higher level of anxiety at baseline and discharge was significantly associated with relapse at 3, but not at 6 months, in all subjects. Higher baseline <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorder</b> identification <b>test</b> scores were associated with relapse at 3 and at 6 months. Intention and planning to attend aftercare after discharge from the hospital were associated with non-relapse at 3 and 6 months, respectively. Levels of depression, of elation and of craving at baseline were not significantly predictive of relapse. Those who had relapsed at 3 months were significantly more likely to remain drinking at 6 months. Rehospitalization within the first 3 months post discharge appeared to be protective against further relapse. Baseline patient factors, including levels of anxiety, appear to play a significant role in relapse to alcohol in this difficult to treat population...|$|R
40|$|Background: Few {{studies have}} {{compared}} characteristics of clients entering alcohol treatment who {{differ in their}} drinking goal preferences or have investigated the relevance of drinking goals {{as a predictor of}} treatment outcomes. Objectives: To investigate associations between baseline drinking goal preferences and client characteristics as well as treatment retention and outcomes among clients in outpatient alcohol treatment. Methods: Secondary data analyses on a longitudinal multicenter study investigating the effectiveness of outpatient alcohol treatment in Switzerland among 805 clients. Assessments were conducted at treatment admission, discharge, and at 6 - and 12 -month follow ups. At-risk drinking was assessed through the <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders</b> identification <b>test.</b> Treatment retention was defined as regular discharge with or without transition into another institution. Results: Clients aiming to abstain from drinking {{were more likely to be}} in retreatment, to be assigned to treatment by a health institution, to have no at-risk <b>alcohol</b> <b>use,</b> and to be already alcohol abstinent at the time of admission relative to clients who aimed to control their drinking. Clients without at-risk <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> at admission showed higher treatment retention when aiming for controlled drinking than for abstinence, while there was no difference in treatment retention among clients with at-risk use. Clients with at-risk use at admission were more likely to reach not-at-risk <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> status when aiming for alcohol abstinence than for controlled drinking. Conclusions: Drinking goals are associated with variables of <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> and treatment assignment. They have different effects on treatment retention and treatment outcomes according to <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> at the time of admission...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background To date, {{the great}} {{majority}} of Russian HIV infections have been diagnosed among IDUs and concerns about the potential for a sexual transmission of HIV beyond the IDU population have increased. This study investigated differences in the prevalence of sexual risk behaviors between IDUs and non-IDUs in St. Petersburg, Russia and assessed associations between substance use patterns and sexual risks within and between those two groups. Methods Cross-sectional survey data and biological test results from 331 IDUs and 65 non-IDUs who have IDU sex partners were analyzed. Multivariate regression was employed to calculate measures of associations. Results IDUs were less likely than non-IDUs to report multiple sexual partners and unprotected sex with casual partners. The quantity, frequency and intensity of <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> did not differ between IDUs and non-IDUs, but non-IDUs were {{more likely to engage in}} <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> categorized as risky per the <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders</b> identification <b>test</b> (AUDIT-C). Risky sexual practices were independently associated with monthly methamphetamine injection among IDUs and with risky <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> among non-IDUs. Having sex when high on alcohol or drugs was associated with unprotected sex only among IDUs. Conclusions Greater prevalence of sexual risk among non-IDUs who have IDU sex partners compared to IDUs suggests the potential for sexual transmission of HIV from the high-prevalence IDU population into the general population. HIV prevention programs among IDUs in St. Petersburg owe special attention to risky <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> among non-IDUs who have IDU sex partners and the propensity of IDUs to have sex when high on alcohol or drugs and forgo condoms. </p...|$|R

Those who fell within its trap, their life changed, their families aggrieved and they shrank from company. The addiction remained alone in the end. To many death was a relief. Methods: A community based cross- sectional {{study was conducted in}} the Catchment area of UHTC (Urban Health and training Centre) where all males aged ≥ 15 years residing in the study area were included. Data was collected by home visit using WHO questionnaire (AUDIT: <b>Alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorder</b> identification <b>test)</b> Modified Kuppuswamy scale was used to assess the socio-economic status of the families. Data was analyzed by appropriate test using SPSS 20. 0 version. Logistic regression was applied to the positively associated results. Results: According to the AUDIT score, Hazardous, Dependent and harmful drinkers were 7. 7 %, 9. 2 % and 2. 4 % respectively. Age, marital status, education of the head of the family,occupation of the respondent, caste, family history of <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> had statistically significant association (P < 0. 05, 95 % confidence interval). Logistic regression was applied and marital status, family history of <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> and caste retained their statistical significance (P < 0. 05, 95 % confidence interval). Conclusions: It can be concluded that being young, being low educated, being married and having a family history of <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> are more at risk to it.

40|$|Background: Doctors {{have been}} {{identified}} as one of the key agents in the prevention of alcohol-related harm, however, their level of use and attitudes toward alcohol will affect such role. Aim: This study is aimed at describing the pattern of <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> and the predictors of hazardous drinking among hospital doctors. Setting: Study was conducted at the Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital, Ado-Ekiti, Nigeria. Design: A cross-sectional survey involving all the doctors in the teaching hospital. Materials and Methods: All the consenting clinicians completed a sociodemographic questionnaire and <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> was measured using the 10 -item <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorder</b> identification <b>test</b> (AUDIT) and psychological well-being was measured by the 12 -item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 12). Statistical Analysis Used: Statistical analyses were done using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 16. Chi-square tests with Yates correction were used to describe the relationship between respondent′s characteristics and AUDIT scores as appropriate. Results: There were a total of 122 participants. Eighty-five (69. 7 %) of them were abstainers, 28 (23 %) were moderate drinkers, and 9 (7. 3 %) hazardous drinkers. With the exception of age, there was no significant relationship between sociodemographic status, years of practice, specialty of practice, and hazardous <b>alcohol</b> <b>use.</b> Experiencing stress or GHQ score above average is significantly associated with hazardous drinking. Conclusion: Hazardous drinking among hospital doctors appears to be essentially a problem of the male gender, especially among those older than 40 years. Stress and other form of psychological distress seem to {{play a significant role in}} predicting hazardous drinking among doctors...|$|R
40|$|Binge {{drinking}} {{represents a}} public health issue and is a known risk factor {{in the development of}} <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders.</b> Previous studies have shown behavioural as well as neuroanatomical alterations associated with binge drinking. Here, we address the question of the automaticity or involuntary nature of the behaviour by assessing goal-directed behaviour and intentionality. In this study, we used a computational two-step task, designed to discern between model-based/goal-directed and model-free/habitual behaviours, and the classic Libet clock task, to study intention awareness, in a sample of 31 severe binge drinkers (BD) and 35 matched healthy volunteers. We observed that BD had impaired goal-directed behaviour in the two-step task compared with healthy volunteers. In the Libet clock task, BD showed delayed intention awareness. Further, we demonstrated that <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> severity, as reflected by the <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders</b> identification <b>test,</b> correlated with decreased conscious awareness of volitional intention in BD, although it was unrelated to performance on the two-step task. However, the time elapsed since the last drinking binge influenced the model-free scores, with BD showing less habitual behaviour after longer abstinence. Our findings suggest that the implementation of goal-directed strategies and the awareness of volitional intention are affected in current heavy alcohol users. However, the modulation of these impairments by <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> severity and abstinence suggests a state effect of <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> in these measures and that top-down volitional control might be ameliorated with <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> cessation.

40|$|Background Risky {{drinking}} {{in young people}} is harmful, highly prevalent and often complicated by comorbid mental health problems that compound alcohol-induced impairment. The hippocampus and the glutamate system have been implicated in the pathophysiology of alcoholism and depression. This study aimed to determine whether risky drinking is associated with glutamate levels recorded within the hippocampus of young adults with major depression. Methods Sixty-three young persons with major depression (22. 1 ± 3. 1 years; 65 % female) and 38 healthy controls were recruited. Participants completed the <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorder</b> identification <b>test</b> and underwent proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure in vivo glutamate levels within the hippocampus following a period of at least 48 h of abstinence. Results Young adults with depression had significantly increased hippocampal glutamate levels and a positive association between the level of <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> and glutamate. Regression analysis revealed that higher levels of hippocampal glutamate were predicted by having increased levels of risky drinking and depression. Limitations Small sample sizes for testing diagnosis by risky {{drinking in}}teraction and use of creatine ratios rather than the absolute concentrations of glutamate. Discussion The hippocampus is a critical region; given its role in learning and memory as well as mood regulation, and the neurochemical changes observed in this study may precede structural changes, which are commonly observed in both depression and alcohol misuse. These findings suggest that young adults with major depression who engage in risky drinking may be at increased risk of glutamate excitotoxicity. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|R
40|$|The {{multifaceted}} gut-brain peptide ghrelin and its receptor (GHSR- 1 a) are {{implicated in}} mechanisms regulating {{not only the}} energy balance but also the reward circuitry. In our pre-clinical models, we have shown that ghrelin increases whereas GHSR- 1 a antagonists decrease alcohol consumption and the motivation to consume alcohol in rodents. Moreover, ghrelin signaling {{is required for the}} rewarding properties of addictive drugs including alcohol and nicotine in rodents. Given the hereditary component underlying addictive behaviors and disorders, we sought to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the pre-proghrelin gene (GHRL) and GHSR- 1 a gene (GHSR) are associated with <b>alcohol</b> <b>use,</b> measured by the <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders</b> identification <b>test</b> (AUDIT) and smoking. Two SNPs located in GHRL, rs 4684677 (Gln 90 Leu) and rs 696217 (Leu 72 Met), and one in GHSR, rs 2948694, were genotyped in a subset (n[*]=[*] 4161) of a Finnish population-based cohort, the Genetics of Sexuality and Aggression project. The effect of these SNPs on AUDIT scores and smoking was investigated using linear and logistic regressions, respectively. We found that the minor allele of the rs 2948694 SNP was nominally associated with higher AUDIT scores (P[*]=[*] 0. 0204, recessive model) and smoking (P[*]=[*] 0. 0002, dominant model). Furthermore, post hoc analyses showed that this risk allele was also associated with increased likelihood of having high level of alcohol problems as determined by AUDIT scores ≥[*] 16 (P[*]=[*] 0. 0043, recessive model). These convergent findings lend further support for the hypothesized involvement of ghrelin signaling in addictive disorders...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The fishing {{communities}} are among population {{groups that are}} most at risk of HIV infection, with some studies putting the HIV prevalence at 5 to 10 times {{higher than in the}} general population. Alcohol consumption has been identified as one of the major drivers of the sexual risk behaviour in the fishing communities. This paper investigates the relationship between alcohol consumption patterns and risky behaviour in two fishing communities on Lake Victoria. Methods Face-to-face interviews were conducted among 303 men and 172 women at the fish landing sites; categorised into fishermen, traders of fish or fish products and other merchandise, and service providers such as casual labourers and waitresses in bars and hotels, including 12 female sexual workers. Stratified random sampling methodology was used to select study units. Multivariable analysis was conducted to assess independent relationship between alcohol consumption and sexual risky behaviour. Measures of alcohol consumption included the <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorder</b> <b>test</b> score (AUDIT), having gotten drunk in previous 30 [*]days, drinking at least 2 times a week while measures for risky behaviour included engaging in transactional sex, inconsistent condom use, having sex with non-regular partner and having multiple sexual partners. Results The level of harmful <b>use</b> of <b>alcohol</b> in the two fishing communities was quite high as 62 % of the male and 52 % of the female drinkers had got drunk in previous 30 [*]days. The level of risky sexual behaviour was equally high as 63 % of the men and 59 % of the women had unprotected sex at last sexual event. Of the 3 occupations fishermen had the highest levels of harmful <b>use</b> of <b>alcohol</b> and risky sexual behaviour followed by service providers judging from values of most indicators. The kind of alcohol consumption variables correlated with risky sexual behaviour variables, varied by occupation. Frequent alcohol consumption, higher AUDIT score, having got drunk, longer drinking hours and drinking {{any day of the week}} were strongly correlated with engaging in transactional sex among fishermen but fewer of the factors exhibited the same correlation among traders and service providers. Fishermen who drank 2 or more times a week were 7. 9 times more likely to have had transactional sex (95 % CI: 2. 05 - 30. 24) compared to those who never drank alcohol. A similar pattern was observed for traders and service providers at the landing sites. Inconsistent condom use or none use of condoms was not significantly correlated with any of the alcohol consumption indicator variables in multivariate analysis except for day of drinking among men. Conclusion Alcohol consumption is strongly correlated with having multiple sexual partners, sex with non-regular partner and engagement in transactional sex but not with consistent condom use at fish landing sites. However, the pattern and strength of this correlation differs by occupation. HIV risk reduction programs targeting the fishing communities should address alcohol consumption, particularly alcohol consumption before sexual contact. Different occupations may need different interventions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This study {{assessed}} intimate partner violence (IPV) and <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> in {{an urban}} population in Pune, India. The prevalence of IPV and <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> was assessed along with the correlation of IPV with alcohol and other variables. Materials and Methods: The study was cross-sectional, questionnaire-based. The materials used were the hurt insult threaten scream (HITS) scale, the <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders</b> identification <b>test,</b> and a brief psychosocial questionnaire. Systematic random sampling was done on the target population. Regression analysis of various factors in relation to HITS score was done. Results: Sample size (n) was 318 individuals. Prevalence of IPV {{was found to be}} 16 % and the victims were mostly women. Prevalence of <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> was 44 %, of which 8. 9 % were harmful users. No female subjects consumed alcohol, but 94 % were aware of their husband's alcohol consumption. No significant correlation was found between IPV and education (P = 0. 220) or income of women (P = 0. 250). Alcohol consumption by males was a significant risk factor for women experiencing IPV (σ = + 0. 524; P< 0. 001). Regression analysis also revealed that increasing marital age (P = 0. 019) and financial support from in-laws (P = 0. 040) were significantly protective. Conclusion: IPV prevalence was less than the national average for India, but the majority of victims was women. The most common type of IPV was verbal. <b>Alcohol</b> <b>use</b> prevalence was higher than the national average, but harmful <b>use</b> was lower. <b>Alcohol</b> <b>use</b> is a significant risk factor for IPV.

This study examines the 2 -year outcome of 2 different alcohol intervention programs at university halls of residence. Methods: Ninety-eight university halls of residence (with 556 students) were cluster randomized to 2 different intervention groups: a brief skills training program (BSTP) with interactive lectures and discussions, a twelve-step–influenced (TSI) program with didactic lectures by therapists trained in the 12 -step approach, and a control group. All students completing the baseline assessment received personalized feedback by mail. Students responded to mailed follow-up questionnaires after 1, 2, and 3 years, including <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders</b> identification <b>test</b> (AUDIT; years 2 and 3), short index of problems (SIP), and estimated blood alcohol concentration (eBAC). Results: All groups significantly reduced their AUDIT scores from baseline to the second year follow-up, with {{no significant differences between the}} groups. Seventy-seven percent of the students belonged to a population with high-risk consumption, using the AUDIT cut-off scores of 8 and 4 for men and women, respectively. Students with high-risk alcohol consumption showed significant differences in AUDIT score reduction in favor of the BSTP compared with controls, and had a tendency to show better results than the TSI intervention (p= 0. 06). Similar trends could be seen using SIP and eBAC. The TSI did not differ significantly from the control group within the group of students with high-risk alcohol consumption.

40|$|Treatment and {{prevention}} of alcohol-related harm includes attention to {{the full range of}} alcohol problems that occur, including hazardous and harmful drinking as well as alcohol dependence. The prevalence of these problems is high, amounting to about one in four of the adult population of the United Kingdom, which is similar to the numbers who smoke. Definition and role: screening and brief alcohol interventions are secondary prevention activities involving early identification of alcohol-related risk or harm, followed by advice or counselling to help reduce this risk or harm. Screening and brief interventions delivered opportunistically in medical settings have a crucial role to play in improving public health. Screening instrument: that of choice is the <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>disorders</b> identification <b>test</b> (AUDIT), shorter versions of which are available for use in situations where time for screening is limited. Aim and efficacy of brief interventions: the usual goal is to reduce drinking to low-risk levels, and there is very good evidence from numerous randomized controlled trials that the alcohol consumption of hazardous and harmful drinkers can be reduced to this target, with the number needed to treat (NNT) for a successful outcome of brief alcohol intervention being about ten, which compares favourably with physicians' advice to quit smoking. Delivery of brief intervention: there are two basic methods: (1) simple brief interventionâ€”comprising simple, structured advice that can be delivered by someone without extensive training in 3 to 5 min; and (2) extended brief intervention, brief behavioural counselling that takes from 20 to 30 min, possibly involves repeat consultations, and needs training to deliver...|$|R
