60|$|The three chief requisites, I should say, are: (1) The {{establishment}} of an orderly Government; (2) industrial development under Chinese control; (3) The spread of education. All these aims {{will have to be}} pursued concurrently, but on the whole their urgency seems to me to come in the <b>above</b> order. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> already <b>seen</b> how large a part the State will have to take in building up industry, and how impossible this is while the political anarchy continues. Funds for education on a large scale are also unobtainable until there is good government. Therefore good government is the prerequisite of all other reforms. Industrialism and education are closely connected, and {{it would be difficult to}} decide the priority between them; but I have put industrialism first, because, unless it is developed very soon by the Chinese, foreigners will have acquired such a strong hold that it will be very difficult indeed to oust them. These reasons have decided me that our three problems ought to be taken in the above order.|$|R
60|$|Four sets of {{measurements}} {{are given in}} Table 7/A. In one of these the crossed plants exceed the self-fertilised in average height, so {{that this is not}} one of the exceptions here to be considered. In two other cases the crossed equalled the self-fertilised in height within five per cent; and in the fourth case the self-fertilised exceeded the crossed by <b>above</b> this limit. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> in Table 7/C that the whole advantage of a cross by a fresh stock is confined to fertility, and so it was with the intercrossed plants of the same stock compared with the self-fertilised, for the former were in fertility to the latter as 100 to 89. The intercrossed plants thus have at least one important advantage over the self-fertilised. Moreover, the flowers on the parent-plants when fertilised with pollen from another individual of the same stock yield far more seeds than when self-fertilised; the flowers in this latter case being often quite sterile. We may therefore conclude that a cross does some good, though it does not give to the crossed seedlings increased powers of growth.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Cryptographic devices leak {{timing and}} power {{consumption}} {{information that is}} easily measurable, radiation of various levels, and more. Such devices also have additional inputs, other than plaintext and keys, like voltage, which can be modified to force the device to produce certain faulty outputs {{that can be used}} to reveal the secret key. Side-channel cryptanalysis uses the information that leaks through one or more side channels of a cryptographic system to obtain secret information. The initial focus of side-channel research was on smart card security. There are two main reasons why smart cards were the first type of devices that was analyzed extensively from the side-channel point of view. Smart cards store secret values inside the card and they are especially designed to protect and process these secret values. Therefore, there is a serious financial gain involved in cracking smart cards, as well as, analyzing them and developing more secure smart card technologies. The recent promises from Trusted Computing community indicate the security assurance of storing such secret values in PC platforms, c. f. [99]. These promises have made the side-channel analysis of PC platforms as desirable as that of smart cards. The second reason of the high attention to side-channel analysis of smart cards is due to the ease of applying such attacks to them. The measurements of side-channel information on smart cards are almost “noiseless”, which makes such attacks very practical. On the other hand, there are many factors that affect such measurements on real commodity computer systems. These factors create noise, and therefore it is much more difficult to develop and perform successful attacks on such “real” computers within our daily life. Thus, until very recently the vulnerability of systems even running on servers was not “really” considered to be harmful by such side-channel attacks. This was changed with the work of Brumley and Boneh, c. f. [21], who demonstrated a remote timing attack over a local network. Because of the <b>above</b> reasons, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> an increased research effort on the security analysis of the daily life PC platforms from the side-channel point of view. Here, it has been especially shown that the functionality of the common components of processor architectures creates an indisputable security risk, c. f. [1, 2, 5, 14, 73, 80], which comes in different forms. In this thesis, we focus on side-channel cryptanalysis of cryptosystems on commodity computer platforms. Especially, we analyze two main CPU components, cache and branch prediction unit, from side-channel point of view. We show that the functionalities of these two components create very serious security risks in software systems, especially in software based cryptosystems...|$|R

The documentation <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> from volunteers appears to be more transparent and complete than the information provided by public institutions, and it is better accessible than news from many public and private media (where we often faced the issue that materials could not be retrieved anymore, at least not under the original links).|$|R
