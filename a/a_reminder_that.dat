5|$|After the United States entered World War I in 1917, {{images of}} the statue were heavily used in both {{recruitment}} posters and the Liberty Bond drives that urged American citizens to support the war financially. This impressed upon the public the war's stated purpose—to secure liberty—and served as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> embattled France had given the United States the statue.|$|E
5|$|A {{transitional}} fossil is any fossilized {{remains of}} a life form that exhibits traits common to both an ancestral group and its derived descendant group. This is especially important where the descendant group is sharply differentiated by gross anatomy and mode of living from the ancestral group. These fossils serve as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> taxonomic divisions are human constructs that have been imposed in hindsight on a continuum of variation. Because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, there is usually {{no way to know}} exactly how close a transitional fossil is to the point of divergence. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that transitional fossils are direct ancestors of more recent groups, though they are frequently used as models for such ancestors.|$|E

5|$|Her {{story is}} <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> the {{universal}} denigration of a group, {{based on the}} behaviour of a few, cannot cloud the greatness of the individual. Mandodari defies the stereotype of this racism. She is simple, unswerving, and self-effacing, driven {{by the light of}} knowledge which gives meaning to solid materialism in an age that is shrouded by impulse, passion, and desire. She is the instrument that awakens the mind and counsels reason when irrationality becomes the core being. That she goes unheard and unheeded does not change her path. To her, the dharmic part is inward-looking, while the role of the dutiful wife is the external self. Mandodari thought that her duty to her husband on issues of morals and values ended with her telling him what she thought of his actions. She neither put up any brave fight to stop him nor considered it her duty to do so.|$|E
5|$|Leigh's wealth as an {{industrial}} town resulted in many outlets for the entertainment of its population, including theatres, cinemas and public houses. In 1908 the Hippodrome Theatre on Leigh Road {{was built on}} the site of Walker's silk mill of 1827, this subsequently became a cinema, first the Odeon, later the Classic. Another theatre, the Theatre Royal, was built on Lord Street which later became the Leigh Casino Club. The Palace Cinema was built in 1913 on Railway Road and the assembly rooms above the Conservative Club, were converted to a cinema known as the Sems in 1908. Brewery Lane is <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> there was once a brewery in Bedford belonging to George Shaw & Co.|$|E
5|$|The University of Houston and the University of Texas {{played their}} first {{football}} game {{against one another}} in 1953. Since this was their first meeting, members of Alpha Phi Omega—the service fraternity in charge {{of taking care of}} ShastaI, the university's mascot—brought her to the game. During the trip, Shasta's front paw was caught in the cage door and one toe was cut off. At the game, several Longhorn players saw what had happened and began taunting UH players by holding up their hands with the ring finger bent, suggesting the Cougars were invalids. Texas went on to win this game 28–7. UH students had been using the victory sign as a hand signal up to that time, but began using the bent-finger sign as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> they would remember the taunts.|$|E

5|$|The guide-wheel, which {{protrudes}} {{just ahead of}} the front wheels, is {{the most important part of}} the bus when travelling on the O-Bahn. It is connected directly to the steering mechanism, and steers the bus by running along the raised edge of the track. While it is not strictly necessary for drivers to hold the steering wheel when travelling on the O-Bahn because of the guide-wheel, safety procedures require the driver to be alert to their circumstances at all times. A rumble strip before stations is <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> they need to resume control. The guide-wheel is the most delicate part of the system and is designed to snap off upon sharp impact; before the O-Bahn was in place, a number of buses were fitted with guide-wheels for their ordinary routes to test their durability. Drivers were forced to be more cautious on their normal trips after numerous guide-wheel-to-kerb impacts.|$|E
5|$|The main axes of {{the museum}} grid that is offset by 22.5 degrees begins with the arrival plaza, carries through {{the edge of the}} stairs up to the main entrance, aligns with the columns {{supporting}} the rotunda as well as the center point of the rotunda, aligns with travertine benches in the courtyard between the pavilions, includes a narrow walkway between the west and south pavilions, a staircase down to the cactus garden and ends in the garden. The corresponding cross axis starts with the center point of the circle forming the GRI library garden, then passing {{to the center of the}} entrance rotunda, and aligning with the south wall of the rotunda building. Although all of the Museum is aligned on these alternative axes, portions of the exhibitions pavilion and the east pavilion are aligned on the true north-south axis as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> both grids are present in the campus.|$|E
5|$|The {{portrait}} {{depicts the}} tensions and manoeuvrings of 16th century court politics. The deep red background and heavy brushstrokes establish an anxious and tense atmosphere, and the uneasy {{relationship between the}} Pope and his suitors. The pope is old, ill and tired and, to some critics' eyes, glares at Ottavio in an accusatory manner. His hat or camauro cloaks his baldness, but there are tell-tale signs of age in his long nose, dark beady eyes, stooped shoulders and long uneven beard. He is noticeably older than in the second Naples portrait of 1543. This fact {{is reinforced by the}} clock placed on the table beside him, which serves both as a memento mori and <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> time is running out. Given this, the presence of his grandsons indicates that the commission was prompted by thoughts of succession.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Dual-income {{families}} experience stress as {{they attempt}} to manage the conflicting responsibilities of work, school, home, and enrichment activities. Opportunities exist for technology to provide support in managing their children’s activities, helping parents feel more in control of their lives. In this paper, we explore opportunities to support children’s activities. Based on our contextual fieldwork with dual-income families, we suggest a concept of the Smart Bag, which addresses two design opportunities: (i) <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> system <b>that</b> helps people remember their schedules and what they need to take, and (ii) <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> system <b>that</b> allows parents to engage in parenting. ...|$|R
5|$|Molyneux was {{impressed}} with the creature's navigation code: he stated that it is the largest piece of code, and that players could change the map repeatedly and creatures will still find routes to their destinations. Molyneux also liked the fact that the game adapts to the player, enabling the choice of the preferred methods and strategies, and stated that his favourite part of the game is how the player digs out rather than build up, meaning the player has heavy involvement in building the level. He stated that he was proud of Dungeon Keepers concept, but remarked that doing original things takes time. He also liked that people were unable to describe Dungeon Keeper in any particular way. Molyneux disliked the user interface, saying the team overdid the control panel, and commented that it was <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> the player was playing a video game. This was a key reason the user interface of his next video game, Black & White, did not feature panels, buttons, or icons.|$|E

The sermon presents the ethics of the kingdom of God, introduced by the Beatitudes ("Blessed are...").

25|$|In {{the later}} primary Upanishadic texts, Devas and Asuras discuss and act to seek knowledge, for {{different}} purposes. In one case, for example, {{they go to}} Prajāpati, their father, {{to understand what is}} Self (Atman, soul) and how to realize it. The first answer that Prajāpati gives is simplistic, which the Asuras accept and leave with, but the Devas led by Indra do not accept and question because Indra finds that he hasn't grasped its full significance and the given answer has inconsistencies. Edelmann states that this symbolism embedded in the Upanishads is <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> one must struggle with presented ideas, learning is a process, and Deva nature emerges with effort.|$|E
