5|$|Many small {{communities}} obtain their drinking water from diverse sources (lakes, streams, springs <b>and</b> <b>groundwater</b> wells). Levels of treatment vary widely, from rudimentary systems with coarse screening or settling followed by disinfection (usually chlorination), to more sophisticated systems using a filtration step.

In 2002, about 97% of air pollution, 86% of total waste and 23% of water pollution in Estonia came from the power industry, which uses oil shale as the main resource for its power production.|$|E
40|$|The geochemical and isotopic {{composition}} of surface water <b>and</b> <b>groundwaters</b> in the Velenje Basin, Slovenia,were investigated {{to gain a}} better understanding of the origin of surface <b>and</b> <b>groundwaters.</b> Surface waters andgroundwaters from the Triassic aquifer are dominated by HCO 3 -, Ca 2 +, and Mg 2 + from dissolution of carbonate minerals,while groundwaters from the Pliocene and Lithotamnium aquifers have distinct geochemical signatures,enriched in Na+ and K+. Surface waters are controlled by calcite dissolution, while groundwaters from the Triassicaquifer are controlled by dolomite dissolution. The partial pressure of CO 2 in surface waters <b>and</b> <b>groundwaters</b> iswell above atmospheric concentrations, indicating that these waters are a potential source of CO 2 to the atmosphere. The δ 13 CDIC values of surface waters are shown to be controlled by biogeochemical processes in the terrestrial environment,such as dissolution of carbonates, degradation of organic matter, and exchange with atmospheric CO 2,which is more pronounced in the lake waters. The δ 13 CDIC values of groundwater from the Triassic aquifer are consistentwith degradation of CO 2 and dissolution of dolomite. Groundwaters from the Pliocene and Lithotamniumaquifers have δ 13 CDIC values suggestive of biogenic CO 2 reduction and degradation of organic matter...|$|R

5|$|The Trinity River is a {{predominantly}} rain-fed river, {{with the highest}} flows occurring between December and April and the lowest from August through October. The water level can rise quickly in the winter when large Pacific storms strike California's north coast. Almost no precipitation occurs in summer, when {{the primary source of}} flow is snowmelt from the higher elevations of the Klamath Mountains <b>and</b> <b>groundwater</b> base flow. In addition, diversion of water to the Central Valley has greatly reduced the total flow of the river since the 1960s, though conversely, a required minimum dam release for protection of migrating salmon results in a flow rate during the dry season that is higher than it naturally would be.|$|E

The city's water department also operates four dams along the Huron River, two of which provide hydroelectric power. The city also offers waste management services, with Recycle Ann Arbor handling recycling service. Other utilities are provided by private entities. Electrical power and gas are provided by DTE Energy. AT Inc. is the primary wired telephone service provider for the area. Cable TV service is primarily provided by Comcast.|$|E

Water pumped from the mines and used by oil shale-fired power stations exceeds 90% of all water used in Estonia.

5|$|The water {{also appears}} murky {{due to a}} high level of turbidity; however, this is not usually a health risk. However, the turbidity, which is caused by wind, {{prevents}} photosynthetic stabilisation. Siltation is not considered a major problem and is only a factor in the East Basin, but dredging is not required. The problem has eased with the construction of the Googong Dam, and the spectre of heavy metal pollution has receded, partly due to the closure of some lead mines upstream. However, leaching <b>and</b> <b>groundwater</b> leakage still causes some pollution. Rubbish, oil and sediment traps have been set up at the incoming openings to the lake to minimise pollution.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of efforts to control water {{resources}} in Florida and projects to drain the Everglades during the early and mid-20th century, water flow into Biscayne Bay has been altered by the construction of canals. These canals channel water from portions of the southeastern Everglades now used for agriculture into the bay. Prior to canal construction, most fresh water inflow came from rain <b>and</b> <b>groundwater,</b> but the canals are now altering the salinity profile of the bay, conveying sediment and pollutants and leading to saltwater intrusion into the Biscayne aquifer. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was established in 2000 to mitigate the effects of human intervention into the natural water flow of the Everglades. Primarily aimed at the restoration of historical patterns of water flow into Everglades National Park, the project will also deal with issues arising from the diversion of {{water out of the}} southern Everglades into Biscayne Bay. The Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetlands Project (BBCW) is a CERP component specifically intended to redistribute water flow so that fresh water is introduced gradually through creeks and marshes rather than short, heavy discharges through drainage canals.|$|E
5|$|In July 2007, {{a report}} by Waterman Environmental was publicised by Councillor Craig, which {{revealed}} that the land upon which the Abbey Mills Mosque would be built is considered to have a medium-to-high contamination risk.

Craig was alleged to have obtained this information under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, and he called for the Environment Agency to be brought in and for the site to be shut down until an independent report was undertaken. According to Craig, the Waterman Report revealed that the original pre-remediation works had discovered soil <b>and</b> <b>groundwater</b> impact by mercury, lead, arsenic, oil, fuels, and asbestos fibres.

5|$|Water is the {{dominant}} element in the Everglades, and it shapes the land, vegetation, and animal life of South Florida. The South Florida climate was once arid and semi-arid, interspersed with wet periods. Between 10,000 and 20,000years ago, sea levels rose, submerging portions of the Florida peninsula and causing the water table to rise. Fresh water saturated the limestone, eroding some of it and creating springs and sinkholes. The abundance of fresh water allowed new vegetation to take root, and through evaporation formed thunderstorms. Limestone was dissolved by the slightly acidic rainwater. The limestone wore away, <b>and</b> <b>groundwater</b> {{came into contact with}} the surface, creating a massive wetland ecosystem. Although the region appears flat, the wearing away of the limestone in some areas created slight valleys and plateaus—a difference of inches in elevation—that affected not only the flow of water, but also types of vegetation present.|$|E
