5|$|Early in December 1900, we {{received}} from Lowell Observatory in Arizona a telegram that <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>of</b> light {{had been seen}} to project from Mars (the Lowell observatory makes a specialty of Mars) lasting seventy minutes. I wired these facts to Europe and sent out neostyle copies through this country. The observer there is a careful, reliable man {{and there is no}} reason to doubt that the light existed. It was given as from a well-known geographical point on Mars. That was all. Now the story has gone the world over. In Europe it is stated that I have been in communication with Mars, and all sorts of exaggerations have spring up. Whatever the light was, we have no means of knowing. Whether it had intelligence or not, no one can say. It is absolutely inexplicable.|$|E
5|$|Stage directors, unaided by {{post-production}} {{effects and}} camera tricks, have used other methods {{to depict the}} ghost. In the late 19th century, elaborate productions of the play staged by Henry Irving employed {{a wide variety of}} approaches for this task. In 1877 a green silhouette was used to create a ghostlike image; ten years later a trick chair was used to allow an actor to appear {{in the middle of the}} scene, and then again from the midst of the audience. In 1895 <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>of</b> blue light served to indicate the presence of Banquo's spirit. In 1933 a Russian director named Theodore Komisarjevsky staged a modern retelling of the play (Banquo and Macbeth were told of their future through palmistry); he used Macbeth's shadow as the ghost. In 1936 Orson Welles directed the Federal Theatre Project production of the play, with an African-American cast that included Canada Lee in the role of Banquo.|$|E

25|$|The {{ceremonial}} mace of {{the university}} is made of stainless steel with silver facings and <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>of</b> eumung timber. On the head are mounted four silver shields, two engraved with {{the arms of the}} State of New South Wales and two with the original-design arms {{of the university}}. A silver Waratah, NSW's floral emblem, surmounts the head. The mace was donated to the university by Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited and was presented by the company's chairman, Colin Syme, on 6 December 1962. A former NSW Government Architect, Cobden Parkes, was appointed as the first official mace-bearer.|$|E
25|$|The {{transport}} then {{approaches a}} dark area and stops. Indiana Jones suddenly appears above the vehicle {{hanging on a}} rope in <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>of</b> light. He welcomes the adventurers' rescue and bids them {{to turn on the}} headlights and prepare for him to board. As the lights flicker on, they illuminate a massive boulder rolling toward the transport. The transport seems to back up as the boulder threatens to crush Jones and the tourists. At the last possible second, the transport accelerates and suddenly the floor seems to give way, sending the transport into the chamber below. An impact resonates through the chamber, as if the boulder has crashed down, nearly striking the transport.|$|E

25|$|An augercast pile, often {{known as}} a {{continuous}} flight augering (CFA) pile, is formed by drilling into {{the ground with a}} hollow stemmed continuous flight auger to the required depth or degree of resistance. No casing is required. A cement grout mix is then pumped down the stem of the auger. While the cement grout is pumped, the auger is slowly withdrawn, conveying the soil upward along the flights. <b>A</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>of</b> fluid cement grout is formed to ground level. Reinforcement can be installed. Recent innovations in addition to stringent quality control allows reinforcing cages to be placed up to the full length of a pile when required. A typical reinforcing cage will consist of 4 to 8 bars from #5 to #8 bars typically 1/3 the length of the pile with longitudinal circular ties spaced {{along the length of the}} cage. Where tension loads are present it is typical to see a single full length bar placed at the center of each pile.|$|E
500|$|The {{agreement}} was initialed on 25 July 1963, just 10 days after negotiations commenced. The following day, Kennedy delivered a 26-minute televised {{address on the}} agreement, declaring that since the invention of nuclear weapons, [...] "all mankind has been struggling {{to escape from the}} darkening prospect of mass destruction on earth... Yesterday <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>of</b> light cut into the darkness." [...] Kennedy expressed hope that the test ban would be the first step towards broader rapprochement, limit nuclear fallout, restrict nuclear proliferation, and slow the arms race {{in such a way that}} fortifies US security. Kennedy concluded his address in reference to a Chinese proverb that he had used with Khrushchev in Vienna two years prior. [...] "'A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step,'" [...] Kennedy said. [...] "And if that journey is a thousand miles, or even more, let history record that we, in this land, at this time, took the first step." ...|$|E
500|$|Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson: Cameron said {{he needed}} the cast to {{feel as though they}} were really on the Titanic, to relive its liveliness, and [...] "to take that energy and give it to Jack, [...] an artist who is able to have his heart soar". Jack is portrayed as an itinerant, poor orphan from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, who has toured {{numerous}} places in the world, including Paris. He wins two tickets onto the RMS Titanic in a poker game and travels as a third-class passenger with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight and meets her when she contemplates throwing herself off the stern of the ship. Her fiance's [...] "reward", an invitation to dine with them the next evening, enables Jack to mix with the first-class passengers for a night. When casting the role, various established actors, including Matthew McConaughey, Chris O'Donnell, Billy Crudup, and Stephen Dorff, were considered, but Cameron felt that a few of the actors were too old for the part of a 20-year-old. Tom Cruise was interested in portraying the character, but his asking price was too much for the studio to consider. Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role, but Leto refused to audition. DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron's attention by casting director Mali Finn. Initially, {{he did not want to}} portray the character and refused to read his first romantic scene on the set (see below). Cameron said, [...] "He read it once, then started goofing around, and I could never get him to focus on it again. But for one split second, <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>of</b> light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest." [...] Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio's acting ability and told him, [...] "Look, I'm not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I'm not going to give him a tic and a limp and all the things you want." [...] Cameron rather envisioned the character as a James Stewart type. Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled [...] "J. Dawson". The real J. Dawson was Joseph Dawson, who shoveled coal in the bowels of the ship. [...] "It wasn't until after the movie came out that we found out that there was a J. Dawson gravestone," [...] said the film's producer, Jon Landau, in an interview.|$|E

50|$|A men's Olympic barbell weighs 20 kg (44 lbs) with <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> {{diameter}} <b>of</b> 28 mm and {{a length}} of 2200 mm, whereas a women's Olympic barbell weighs 15 kg (33 lbs) and has <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> diameter <b>of</b> 25 mm with {{a length of}} 2010 mm. The distance between the sleeves, however, {{is the same for}} the men's and the women's bars at 1310 mm. The grip texture of the bar is called the knurling, and is distributed differently between the men's and women's bars: the men's has knurling in the centre but the women's does not. The Olympic barbells used in competition are certified by the IWF.|$|R
2500|$|In Tang Dynasty China, {{the goddess}} weaver floated down on <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>of</b> {{moonlight}} {{with her two}} attendants. [...] She showed the upright court official Guo Han in his garden that a goddess's robe is seamless, for it is woven {{without the use of}} needle and thread, entirely on the loom. The phrase [...] "a goddess's robe is seamless" [...] passed into an idiom to express perfect workmanship. [...] This idiom is also used to mean a perfect, comprehensive plan.|$|E
2500|$|A unique {{feature of}} vibraphone {{resonators}} is <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>of</b> rotating discs, commonly called fans, across the top. [...] When {{the fans are}} open (vertical) the resonators have full function. [...] When the fans are closed (horizontal) the resonators are partially occluded, reducing the resonance of the fundamental pitch. [...] A drive belt connects the shafts to an electric motor (see below) beneath the playing surface, and rotation of the fans creates what many people call a [...] "vibrato" [...] effect; however in actuality it is a tremolo, i.e. periodic modulation of amplitude, not pitch.|$|E
2500|$|Criticism of the {{organisation}} {{of the competition}} caused it to be re-run. Railton submitted a slightly revised design, and was once again declared the winner, with the stipulation that the statue of Nelson should be made by EH Baily. The original plan was for a column [...] high, including the base and statue, but this was reduced to [...] with <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>of</b> [...] due to concerns over stability. The base {{was to have been}} of granite and the shaft of Craigleith sandstone, but before construction began it was decided that the shaft should also be of granite.|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{the delegates}} at the {{ceremony}} wore black, still observing a period of mourning after the recent death of Queen Victoria. To balance this Roberts gave some emphasis to the choir, who were dressed in white. <b>A</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>of</b> light focused on the Duke reading the King's proclamation also provides some colour; this phenomenon was remarked upon by contemporary newspaper reports. Artistic licence was taken with the dais shown as much higher that it actually was and some other architectural features of the building either downplayed or ignored. Roberts also honoured the [...] "Father of Federation", Henry Parkes, who had died five years previous. He added a portrait of Parkes {{in the form of}} a painting above the dais, this painting was not there on the day.|$|E
2500|$|Hopper's Room in New York (1932) and Cape Cod Evening (1939) {{are prime}} {{examples}} of his [...] "couple" [...] paintings. In the first, {{a young couple}} appear alienated and uncommunicative—he reading the newspaper while she idles by the piano. The viewer takes {{on the role of}} a voyeur, as if looking with a telescope through the window of the apartment to spy on the couple's lack of intimacy. In the latter painting, an older couple with little to say to each other, are playing with their dog, whose own attention is drawn away from his masters. Hopper takes the couple theme to a more ambitious level with Excursion into Philosophy [...] (1959). A middle-aged man sits dejectedly {{on the edge of a}} bed. Beside him lies an open book and a partially clad woman. <b>A</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>of</b> light illuminates the floor in front of him. Jo Hopper noted in their log book, [...] "he open book is Plato, reread too late".|$|E
2500|$|... "It {{was said}} that (Zoroaster's) birth was foretold from the {{beginning}} of time, and that the moment he was born, he burst out laughing and the whole universe rejoiced with him." [...] After his birth evil demons tried to destroy him, but with Ahura Mazda's protection, he survived all attempts on his life. [...] The Zoroastrian tradition differs from the Christian one because the divine only assists in the preservation of Zoroaster’s seed. [...] "The central scripture, the Avesta and also the Pahlavi texts include the tradition that the 'kingly glory' is handed onward from ruler to ruler and from saint to saint for the purpose of illuminating ultimately the soul of the Zarathushtra." [...] Also the scriptures clearly allude to conjugal relations between his parents, during which evil spirits try to prevent his conception. [...] But according to later tradition, Zoroaster's mother, Dughdova, was a virgin when she conceived Zoroaster by <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>of</b> light.|$|E

2500|$|In Fable, a player's Hero has {{a measure}} of good or evil {{alignment}} based on the Hero's actions. Good deeds award good points, which produce a positive alignment, while committing evil acts adds evil points, producing a negative alignment. Killing monsters or saving villagers are acts of good, whereas killing innocents, breaking laws, or abusing a spouse will accumulate evil points. Consuming certain foodstuffs can also affect the Hero's alignment; for example, eating tofu will earn the hero positive points, while eating crunchy chicks (because crunchy chicks {{are assumed to be}} still alive) will earn evil points. The player may also pray at the temples of Avo and Skorm. Donations to the Temple of Avo will result in good points, while [...] "gifts" [...] to the Chapel of Skorm will result in evil points. [...] The alignment affects not only the responses of non-player characters around the Hero, but also the appearance of the Hero himself. A Hero with a strongly positive alignment will feature a halo and <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>of</b> sparkling light above his head, butterflies fluttering around him and lighter features. An evil Hero emits a red haze from around his legs, draws flies, has glowing red eyes and grows horns.|$|E
