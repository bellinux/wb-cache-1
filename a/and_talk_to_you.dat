500|$|One of my very {{greatest}} fears as a {{child was}} being ridiculed in public. And there it was coming true. As a television presenter, I'd been respected. People {{come up to you}} in the street and shake your hand <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> in a respectful way. And suddenly, overnight, this was transformed into [...] "Icke's a nutter." [...] I couldn't walk down any street in Britain without being laughed at. It was a nightmare. My children were devastated because their dad was a figure of ridicule.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have the}} air, my red friend," [...] he remarked, [...] "of being unaccustomed to those {{delicate}} weapons. Do keep your fingers off the trigger. I will {{walk to the}} hand-car house <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> with pleasure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} hold up until I knock {{the bottom of this}} {{contract}} out," [...] he said, good-humouredly. [...] "I can't do it if I stop <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Get a move on. Light out of this!" ...|$|E

60|$|His {{deep voice}} came out, awfully veiled, {{as though he}} had been {{overwhelmed}} by the earth of a landslide, <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> of the thoughts that haunt the dead in their graves. A cold shudder ran down Mr. Van Wyk's back.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> as I do. I've {{known you}} a few hours, and I've known HIM all my life; so that if the ease I thus take with you about him isn't magnificent"--and {{the thought of it}} held him a moment--"why it's rather base." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{you will}} {{when you have}} thought about it quietly by yourself, I won't tell you now how {{surprised}} and disappointed I am, but by and by I will come up <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> in your room." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will come}} <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{for a few}} minutes, if I may," [...] Deyes said. [...] "I leave the Church and {{agriculture}} to hobnob. Somehow I don't fancy that as a buffer I should be a success." ...|$|E
6000|$|Alton laughed, and Miss Deringham found {{something}} pleasant in his naive directness. [...] "Now, that's not fair. If I had been I should have gone," [...] said he. [...] "It would please {{me to stay}} right here <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> all day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “But I got {{the word}} from some fellows in Leesburgh. They {{followed}} you from the hotel <b>to</b> the show <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> afterwards, <b>and</b> they said you told them your name was Porter, and the other chap said his name was Morr. They said you gave the names of Poole and Plum just to keep your real identity hidden.” ...|$|R
60|$|ALBERTO (in {{a desperate}} voice that {{breaks into a}} sob). Lucrezia! <b>You</b> must come <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me. <b>You</b> must.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} formal, to-day," [...] she declared. [...] "You give {{too many of}} your {{thoughts}} to your little friend. I {{do not think that}} you are treating me kindly. I should like <b>to</b> sit with <b>you</b> in my room <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> of my books. Look, is it not pretty?" ...|$|R
6000|$|BURGE-LUBIN. Cant {{you find}} an {{official}} pretext {{for coming to}} see me? Isnt it ridiculous that we have never met? It's so tantalizing to see you <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and to know {{all the time that}} you are two hundred miles away, and that I cant touch you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After all, {{there are}} great things {{left in the world}} for you. Painting is only one slender branch of the great tree. To-night all this may seem hard and cruel. To-morrow you will feel like a freed woman. To-morrow I shall come <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> again--of other things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Maggie, you naughty child, haven't you {{begun to}} undress?" [...] said Lucy, in astonishment. [...] "I {{promised not to}} come <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> because I thought you must be tired. But here you are, looking {{as if you were}} ready to dress for a ball. Come, come, get on your dressing-gown and unplait your hair." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, I know, dear. Our {{country needs}} you, so you mustn't break down. Now come and drink {{a cup of}} coffee <b>and</b> I'll <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> I've a secret to tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad," [...] he said, [...] "to {{find that}} you are so consistent. There is Mrs. Travers scolding the deck steward. Go <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her! <b>You</b> will {{scarcely}} find a better opportunity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to take a mean {{advantage}} of you, Mr. Vane," [...] he said, [...] "and sit here awhile <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Would you object to waiting a little while, Miss Flint? I have something to say to you," [...] he added significantly, [...] "and this meeting will save me a trip to Fairview." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, I can quite understand," [...] he said, [...] "that Griffiths is {{suspicious}} about me, but, after all, no one {{can prove}} that I have broken the law here, and I shall not make things any better by attempting an opera bouffe flight. Can I have my head tied up and come <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about it later on?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Like--well, I'd {{rather be}} with you <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> than any girl I ever saw. I don't care who she is," [...] Bob declared, [...] "or how much she may have traveled." [...] He was running into deep water. [...] "Why are you so cold, Cynthia?" [...] "Why can't you be as you used to be? You used to like me well enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Zook, {{you have}} at all events the means {{to make a good}} supper, so sit down and go <b>to</b> work, <b>and</b> I'll <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> while you eat,--but, stay, hand me the bundle of old clothes." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Everythink else!' roared Riderhood, in a {{very loud}} and furious way. 'Answer me like that, <b>and</b> I won't <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> at all.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] {{said the}} Absolute Fool, [...] "you refuse me your confidence, do you? But {{allow me to}} remark that I have a Gryphoness with me who is very frightful to look at, and whom it was my {{intention}} to keep in the bushes; but if you will not give fair answers to my questions, she must come out <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> {{and that is all}} there is about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's got to be," [...] I answered. [...] "You don't {{know what}} a relief it is, Gilbert, to sit here <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about these things. Guest and I {{scarcely}} ever speak of them. And all the time the minutes slip by, and we get nearer the time. Guest and I are playing a desperate game after all--a single slip {{and we should be}} wiped out. And no one else knows." ...|$|E
60|$|Your first {{sensation}} {{on seeing}} this gentleman is that, somehow or other, you don’t feel equal to company and conversation, and that, {{if you could}} do so without appearing rude, you would rather avoid meeting him; and your object is, therefore, to get off {{on the opposite side of}} the pond to which he is, and to go home quietly and quickly, pretending not to see him. He, on the contrary is yearning to take you by the hand, <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b>|$|E
50|$|No crowded walk or busy streetBut <b>you</b> stop <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> whom <b>you</b> meetOn grass fringed path {{up to the}} store,Or to {{the church}} with welcome door-A spot where simple joys aboundAnd peace and plenty aboundWhere life is real and not a sham,Believe me, this is Effingham.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tain't {{much use}} for fools, <b>you</b> may lay <b>to</b> it--that, nor nothing," [...] cried Silver. [...] "But now, you look here: you're young, you are, but you're {{as smart as}} paint. I see that when I set my eyes on <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> I'll <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> like a man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{let it be}} Nix on the war! Don't {{come here}} <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me! <b>You</b> who were searching {{registers}} {{a year ago to}} find your Essex kin.

6000|$|... "I'll come <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{again when}} there's less rum in your wits," [...] said Wolverstone, rising. [...] "Meanwhile ye'll please to {{remember}} the tale I've told, and say nothing that'll make me out a liar. They all believes me, even the men as sailed wi' me from Port Royal. I've made 'em. If they thought as how you'd taken the King's commission in earnest, and for the purpose o' doing as Morgan did, ye guess what would follow." ...|$|E
6000|$|ASHER (smiling involuntarily). Well, it's been {{a comfort}} {{to drop in}} here <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> {{in spite of what}} you believe. You've got the gift of sympathy, Jonathan. But I don't approve of you're {{spending}} your time in this sort of work--(he waves a hand toward the bench)--which may never come to anything, and in doctoring people for nothing and patching up their troubles. I daresay you enjoy it, but what worries me is how you are going to live? ...|$|E
6000|$|One {{of the few}} {{reasons for}} which I regret our absence from England this summer is that I miss seeing you with my own eyes, and I should like much to see you <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> of things of {{interest}} to both of us. If illness suppresses in us a few sources of pleasure, it leaves the real ich open to influences and keen-sighted to facts which are as surely natural as the fly's wing, though we are apt to consider them vaguely as 'supernatural.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He'll have to {{live through}} several," [...] said Cornelia; [...] "You can excuse me when you go. He's very conceited, <b>and</b> he <b>talks</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{as if he were}} a {{thousand}} years old. I think Mr. Plaisdell is a great deal nicer. He doesn't treat you as if you were--I don't know what!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! go on! I adore it," [...] {{cried the}} lady of 'Mes Larmes.' [...] "Heavenly night! heavenly, heavenly moon! but I must shut my window, <b>and</b> not <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> on account of les moeurs. How droll they are, les moeurs! Adieu." [...] And Pen began to sing the Goodnight to Don Basilio.|$|R
6000|$|... "You--don't--un-der-stand," [...] he retorted, {{chopping}} off {{his words}} rather viciously. [...] "Moreover, you can't understand. Go <b>to</b> the house <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Hannah. Have <b>you</b> any baggage!" ...|$|R
