50|$|The air-based {{separate}} <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> or {{firing chamber}} system {{works on the}} same physical principle as the pressurized reservoir system, but instead of pressurizing the reservoir, a separate, fixed volume chamber is included on the water gun into which water is pumped, compressing the air inside. This technology was first used on the Super Soaker SS 100. This allows the reservoir to be removed/opened at any time for refilling since the reservoir is not pressurized. As well, the typically smaller size of the <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> {{and the fact that}} water is typically pumped, as opposed to air, reduces the average number of pumps needed to achieve functional pressure. For improved performance, some users opt to pre-pressurize the firing chamber by pumping in some air first. This increases the starting <b>pressure</b> within the <b>chamber,</b> thus increasing the overall <b>average</b> <b>pressure</b> experienced by the water when it is pumped into the <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber.</b>|$|R

40|$|Past {{research}} with hybrid rockets {{has suggested that}} certain motor operating conditions are conducive {{to the formation of}} pressure oscillations, or flow instabilities, within the motor combustion chamber. These combustion-related vibrations or pressure oscillations may be encountered in virtually any type of rocket motor and typically fall into three frequency ranges: low frequency oscillations (0 - 300 Hz); intermediate frequency oscillations (400 - 1000 Hz); and high frequency oscillations (greater than 1000 Hz). In general, combustion instability is characterized by organized pressure oscillations occurring at well-defined intervals with pressure peaks that may maintain themselves, grow, or die out. Usually, such peaks exceed +/- 5 % of the mean <b>chamber</b> <b>pressure.</b> For hybrid motors, these oscillations have been observed to grow to a limiting amplitude which may be dependent on factors such as fuel characteristics, oxidizer injector characteristics, <b>average</b> <b>chamber</b> <b>pressure,</b> oxidizer mass flux, combustion chamber length, and grain geometry.

Two experimental campaigns are considered in which gaseous oxygen is fed into axisymmetric hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene grains through an axial conical subsonic nozzle. A validation rebuilding of all of the firing tests has been performed first to highlight numerical prediction capabilities and modeling limits.

40|$|Introduction: Dysfunction of Eustachian tube (ET) and the {{associated}} pressure equalizing problems are concerning patients especially in flying and diving. The effect of pressure-regulating earplugs (PREP) on complaints while flying has been evaluated. In addition, the effectivity of laser Eustachian tuboplasty (LETP) has been investigate in a <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber.</b> Methods: 60 patients were included in 3 studies. All of them were examined in a hyperbaric <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> with continuous impedance measurement. In the PREP-study 21 patients were examined double-blind with and without PREP in the <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber.</b> In the LETP- (n= 30) and the diver-longterm-study (n= 9) the ET function before and after LETP were measured. ET opening pressure, ET closing pressure and ET opening duration were evaluated pre- and postoperatively. In the diver-longterm-study also longterm results after 3 - 4 years were collected. Results: PREP-study: Evidence of ET dysfunction was found in twice as many patients with the impedance method in the <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> compared to tympanometry and Valsava test. The number of pressure-equalizing maneuvers did not differ significantly. Patients reported a significantly better subjective state on the visual analogue scale with than without PREP (p < 0. 003). LETP-study: Bevore LETP, 17 patients showed a blocked pattern in <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> testing. Postoperatively, 13 patients of this group showed an improved ET function with a restored normal opening pattern (p < 0. 001). The ET closing pressure was reduced from 6. 24 Â± 3. 46 mbar preoperatively to 4. 06 Â± 2. 36 mbar postoperatively (p < 0. 013). Diver-longterm-study: Preoperatively 5 divers showed a blocked pattern in <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> testing. In 4 of them a normal opening pattern was restored postoperatively (p < 0. 001). The ET closing pressure was reduced significant from 7. 40 Â± 1. 52 mbar preoperatively to 2. 85 Â± 1. 11 mbar postoperatively (p < 0. 005). In the long-term, all subjects reported a restored ability for pressure equalization and 7 of 9 were diving again. Conclusion: A combination of Valsalva manoeuver, tympanometry and continuous impedance measurement in the <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> identifies more patients with pressure equalizing problems than only the both first mentioned ENT-routine diagnostics allone. Although use of PREP {{showed no signs of}} improving ET function, it did significantly improve individual subjective state during sudden pressure changes.

50|$|It uses water {{pressure}} from the water supply system rather than gravity from a raised tank like in previous models. A diaphragm separates a <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> from the main water supply.

The diaphragm technology allows the flush valve to open and let water into the bowl. A main cylinder valve operates up and down. A groove in this cylinder allows water from the main supply to flow through when {{it is in a}} mid position. The valve is shut off at both its top and bottom positions. A second valve, placed within the main cylinder valve, releases the water in the topmost <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> when the flush lever is activated, sending the main cylinder valve shooting upwards. The topmost <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> slowly refills through its narrow passageway, pushing the valve cylinder back down gradually. A flush occurs while it is in its open mid positions.

The valve cannot be kept open by holding the flush lever in the activated position, wasting water, because this only sends the main cylinder valve all the way up to its topmost shutoff position.
