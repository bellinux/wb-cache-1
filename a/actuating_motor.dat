To achieve more humanlike driving behavior such as smooth turning, particularly at high levels of speed, a fuzzy gain scheduling (FGS) strategy is introduced to compensate for the feedback controller for appropriately adapting to the SW command. Instead of man-ual tuning by trial and error, the methodology of FGS is designed to ensure that the closed-loop system can satisfy the crossove...|$|E

In an SBW {{system in a}} passenger car, the usual mechanical linkage between {{the steering wheel and}} the front wheels is replaced with an electrical connection. An SBW system consists of two parts: the steering-wheel system and the front-wheel system. This research considers the tie-rod-actuating type of front-wheel system, in which two independently <b>actuating</b> <b>motors</b> control the front wheels. The steering-wheel and front-wheel motors are modelled, using the bond graph method for both, but controlled by different means. The steering-wheel system control algorithm used a torque map to generate reactive torque and damping. In the development of the tie-rod-actuating-type SBW system described herein, the Ackerman constraint was used for control of the two motors to improve stability and manoeuvrability.

40|$|The head pose and {{movement}} of a user {{is closely related}} with his/her intention and thought, recognition of such information could be useful to develop a natural and sensitive user-wheelchair interface. This paper presents an original integrated approach to a head gesture based interface (HGI) which can perform both identity verification and facial pose estimation. Identity verification is performed by two-factor face authentication which is implemented by the combination of topographic independent component analysis (TICA) and multispace random projection (MRP). Modified synergetic computer with melting (Modified SC-MELT) is introduced to classify facial poses. Motion profile generator (MPG) is thoroughly developed during the integration to convert each estimated facial pose sequence into motion control signal to <b>actuate</b> <b>motor</b> movements. The HGI {{is intended to be}} deployed as a user-wheelchair interface for disabled and elderly users in which only users with genuine face and valid token may be granted authorized access and hence pilot an electric powered wheelchair (EPW) using their faces. The integration has been verified under a number of experiments to justify the feasibility and performance of the proposed face-based control strategy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|A three {{degree of}} freedom (DOF) spherical {{actuator}} is proposed that will replace functions requiring three single DOF actuators in robotic manipulators providing space and weight savings while reducing the overall failure rate. Exploration satellites, Space Station payload manipulators, and rovers requiring pan, tilt, and rotate movements need an actuator for each function. Not only does each actuator introduce additional failure modes and require bulky mechanical gimbals, each contains many moving parts, decreasing mean time to failure. A conventional robotic manipulator {{is shown in figure}} 1. Spherical motors perform all three actuation functions, i. e., three DOF, with only one moving part. Given a standard three actuator system whose actuators have a given failure rate compared to a spherical motor with an equal failure rate, the three actuator system is three times as likely to fail over the latter. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory reliability studies of NASA robotic spacecraft have shown that mechanical hardware/mechanism failures are more frequent and more likely to significantly affect mission success than are electronic failures. Unfortunately, previously designed spherical motors have been unable to provide the performance needed by space missions. This inadequacy is also why they are unavailable commercially. An improved patentable spherically <b>actuated</b> <b>motor</b> (SAM) is proposed to provide the performance and versatility required by NASA missions...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} help elder {{people who suffer from}} lower back pain caused by lower spine degeneration, a novel kind of robot-assisted {{exoskeleton}} spine was designed. It was mainly applied to lift their upper bodies for assisting movements and reducing backache during walking. The aim of this system was to control an elastically <b>actuated</b> <b>motor</b> to provide extra torques on a user’s hip by following the gaits in locomotion. And the whole exoskeletal spine mechanism (exo-spine) has been built of flexible material and fixed on an artificial pelvis. Thanks to the use of a cable-pulley-spring structure the torque applied to the hip is greatly amplified and would eventually affect the deformation of exo-spine, so that an auxiliary force is generated on the lower back to support user’s spine during the movements. Although the overall robot-assisted system was easily imaged and designed, its intrinsic complexity needed careful analysis, because the actuating process becomes highly nonlinear and noisy when compliant movements are demanded to mimic human performances in locomotion. Therefore, some appropriate assumptions were introduced, and to enhance the robustness of system, an adaptive controller was designed by applying Lyapunov Stability Theory. Finally, the correctness and feasibility of our proposed system were tested and estimated through a set of experimental simulations...|$|R
40|$|Shear pins {{are used}} to attach C-SCOUT's fins to their <b>actuating</b> <b>motors,</b> so if {{something}} impacts the fins, the shear pins will break and the fins will fall off, thereby protecting the motors from damage. An analysis {{of the strength of}} the existing Garolite shear pins showed that they will fail during normal operation. It is possible for the fins to break off when the vehicle speed exceeds 2 m/s. Exact failure speeds depend on the angle of attack of the fins. To fix the problem, re-design of the shear pins was attempted, basing the new shear pin strength on the load required to damage an actuator. It was found that the bearings in the actuator's gearbox will be damaged during normal operation, at speeds exceeding 1. 3 m/s. Therefore, the motor will be damaged before the shear pins break, so creating stronger shear pins is not a solution that will protect the motors. Stronger fin actuators should be purchased. The potential for damage to the motors due to operational and impact loads should be considered when selecting a motor. Once new motors are selected, the method described in this report can be used to design appropriate shear pins. Until new actuators and shear pins are installed, C-SCOUT testing can proceed under a 2 m/s speed limit. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

Today, there exist an interest to enlarge the application of these manipulators to outdoor environments. Forestry cranes used in the forestry industry are a clear example. A long term goal in this industry is the development of autonomous systems to increase the logging efficiency. In this thesis, we consider how to control the rotator of these cranes, which is an electro-hydraulically <b>actuated</b> <b>motor,</b> and is used to control the end ffector tool. Control system design for the rotator is a challenging task since the sensing is not available to full extent. The main reason is the harsh environment that these machines are exposed to and sensors such as encoders are very fragile and cannot be used. In this thesis we use alternative sensing devices, such as a magnetic sensor and a stereo camera. In the case of the camera we face a problem with big delay. A prediction method has been used to compute desired values. Due to various reasons certain measuring devices can not be used in the industry. We consider four cases for control system design where dfferent combinations of available sensors have been used. Initially angular position of the rotator is controlled using only the magnetic sensor. A cascade control setup is used where pressure and position are measurable, ﬁrst using the magnetic sensor and later using the camera. When only pressure measurements are available identiﬁed models have replaced sensors for position feedback. All tests and experiments have been done using a scaled version of a real forestry crane.
