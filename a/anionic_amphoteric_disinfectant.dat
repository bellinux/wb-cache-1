40|$|AbstractThe zeta {{potential}} of microbubbles, generated by injecting pressurised air into {{water and then}} releasing the pressure, was determined in the absence and presence of different polyacrylamides. Air was dissolved in either water or solutions of cationic, <b>anionic,</b> <b>amphoteric</b> or nonionic polymers at a constant pressure of four atmospheres. The charge of the bubbles at the shear-zeta plane was measured using a modified microelectrophoresis glass cell, held at a stationary level, at varying pH (2. 0 – 12. 0). Known practical problems with this technique were solved, and these solutions are described in detail. The <b>anionic,</b> <b>amphoteric</b> and nonionic polymers increased the negative charge of the bubbles, but the isoelectric point (iep) remained constant at about pH 2. 0. Conversely, {{in the presence of}} the cationic polymer, the bubbles exhibited positive surface charges between pH 2. 0 and 8. 0 and an iep of pH 8. 0.

Average diameter of the electrospun PVOH fibers prepared from PVOH solution was over 300 nm, and was decreased to 150 nm for the mixture of PVOH/ amphoteric surfactant. To explain the formation of ultrafine fiber, the characteristic properties {{in a mixture of}} PVOH/ surfactant such as surface tension, viscosity, and conductivity were determined.

Synthetic modification of fibrillar cellulose is an option to achieve chemical compatibility in related systems, {{in the formation of}} composites, etc. However, this can also limit the environmental benefits gained from the use of the cellulosic component.

The properties of the products were characterized in detail. The results indicated that there might be steric hindrance effects to C 18 groups on the nanoscaled interior and exterior space of TNs. Therefore, aminopropyl groups were more ready to immobilize on the surface of TNs than C 18 groups when the organosilanes ODS and APS coexisted in reaction solution. C(18) /NH(2) -TNs with the obvious characteristic of C(18) and aminopropyl groups were obtained as the ratio of ODS/APS in reaction solution was 4. 0, and the corresponding proportion of the two groups (C(18) /NH(2)) on the C(18) /NH(2) -TN surface was about 0. 25. This adsorbent had good water dispersibility, overcoming the bad deficiency of reverse phase nanosized materials in water and improving its accessibility to polar analytes. Due to the cooperative effect of alkyl and aminopropyl groups coupled with the residual hydroxyl groups on the surface, C(18) /NH(2) -TNs exhibited excellent affinity efficiency to some ionic or ionizable organic analytes under a different solution pH, including anionic (perfluorooctane sulfonate, perfluorooctanoic acid, and sodium dodecyl sulfate), cationic (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide), and amphoteric compounds (sulfamethazine).

The aim of this licentiate project, which can be regarded as the first part of a doctoral thesis work, is to explore and identify which physicochemical properties of the formulation used for surface sizing are governing the efficiency. In surface sizing the particle suspension is first mixed with starch in solution. Starchparticles and starch is the subject of one study described in this thesis. In this study the interactions between starch and three types of particles, differing in the type of stabilizer used, are explored.

Bentonite and other montmorillonites have large ion exchange capacities, and historically been used for oral detoxification. The main advantage of bentonite {{is its ability to}} entrap cationic drugs and swell to several times its own weight in water. These properties are useful in formulating abuse deterrent medications resistant to methods used for intravenous injection. Methods. Acetaminophen, diclofenac sodium, dextromethorphan hydrobromide, lidocaine hydrochloride, and verapamil hydrochloride were selected to represent different classes of <b>amphoteric,</b> <b>anionic,</b> and cationic structures. Drug solutions at low (200 μg/mL) and high (1000 μg/mL) concentrations were prepared for liquid state drug complexation and entrapment. In glass vials, increasing amounts of bentonite (25, 50 and 100 mg) were mixed with 10 mL of drug solution and vortexed for 5 seconds. After standing for 1 minute, the mixtures were centrifuged (1500 rpm) for 5 minutes to separate the swollen bentonite from free liquid. The supernatant was then filtered and measured for drug concentration using UV-Vis spectroscopy at corresponding drug wavelengths of 248, 275, 276, 263, and 278 nm, respectively. Results. Bentonite used in this study did not selectively bind to acetaminophen (non-ionic) or diclofenac sodium (anionic), whereas it selectively bound to all three cationic drugs with more than 80 % binding capacity.

40|$|Studying {{chemical}} {{enhanced oil}} recovery (EOR) in a high-temperature/high-salinity (HT/HS) reservoir will help expand {{the application of}} chemical EOR to more challenging environments. Until recently, chemical EOR was not recommended at reservoirs that contain high concentrations of divalent cations without the need to recondition the reservoir by flooding it with less saline/ less hardness brines. This strategy was found ineffective in preparing the reservoir for chemical flooding. Surfactants used for chemical flooding operating in high temperatures tend to precipitate when exposed to high concentrations of divalent cations and will partition to the oil phase at high salinities. In this study amphoteric surfactant was used to replace the traditionally used <b>anionic</b> surfactants. <b>Amphoteric</b> surfactants show higher multivalent cations tolerance with better thermal stability. A modified amphoteric surfactant with lower adsorption properties was evaluated for oil recovery. Organic alkali was used to eliminate the water softening process when preparing the chemical solution and reduce potential scale problems caused by precipitation due to incompatibility between chemical slug containing alkali and formation brine. Using organic alkali helped in minimizing softening required when preparing an alkali-surfactant-polymer (ASP) solution using seawater. Solution prepared with organic alkali showed the least injectivity decline when compared to traditional alkalis (NaOH and Na 2 CO 3) and sodium metaborate. Adding organic alkali helped further reduce IFT values when added to surfactant solution. Amphoteric surfactant was found to produce low IFT values at low concentrations and can operate at high salinity / high hardness conditions. When mixed with polymer it improved the viscosity of the surfactant-polymer (SP) solution when prepared in high salinity mixing water (6 % NaCl). When prepared in seawater and tested in reservoir temperature (95 ?C) no reduction in viscosity was found. Unlike the anionic surfactant that causes reduction in viscosity of the SP solution at reservoir temperature. This will not require increasing the polymer concentration in the chemical slug. Unlike the case when anionic surfactant was used and more polymer need {{to be added to}} compensate the reduction in viscosity. Berea sandstone cores show lower recovery compared to dolomite cores. It was also found that Berea cores were more sensitive to polymer concentration and type and injectivity decline can be a serious issue during chemical and polymer injection. Dolomite did not show injectivity decline during chemical and polymer flooding and was not sensitive to the polymer concentration when a polymer with low molecular weight was used. CT scan was employed to study the displacement of oil during ASP, SP, polymer and surfactant flooding. The formation and propagation oil bank was observed during these core flood experiments. ASP and SP flooding showed the highest recovery, and formation and propagation of oil bank was clearer in these experiments compared to surfactant flooding. It was found that in Berea sandstone with a permeability range of 50 to 80 md that the recovery and fluid flow was through some dominating and some smaller channels. This explained the deviation from piston-like displacement, where a sharp change in saturation in part of the flood related to the dominated channels and tapered front with late arrival when oil is recovered from the smaller channels. It was concluded that the recovery in the case of sandstone was dominated by the fluid flow and chemical propagation in the porous media not by the effectiveness of the chemical slug to lower the IFT between the displacing fluid and oil...|$|R

Die Auswahl der untersuchten Verbindungen erfolgte unter Berücksichtigung ihres Produktionsvolumens und der Neuheit auf dem Tensidmarkt. Sie umfasste die Waschmittelinhaltsstoffe lineare Alkylbenzol-sulfonate (LAS), welches das Tensid mit der höchsten Produktionsmenge darstellte, die beiden nichtionischen Tenside Alkylglucamide (AG) und Alkylpolyglucoside (APG), ebenso wie das amphotere Tensid Cocamidopropylbetain (CAPB). Außerdem wurde der polymere Farbübertragungsinhibitor Polyvinylpyrrolidon (PVP) untersucht. The principal {{tasks of}} the present work were 1) to develop and validate sensitive substance-specific methods for the quantitative determination of <b>anionic,</b> non-ionic and <b>amphoteric</b> surfactants and their biochemical degradation intermediates in aqueous environmental samples. These methods were based on advanced hyphenated mass spectrometric techniques. 2) to generate aerobic polar biodegradation products of surfactants in a laboratory-scale fixed-bed bioreactor (FBBR), which was run with a surface water-borne biocoenosis to simulate real environmental conditions. 3) to identify and characterize novel metabolites, generated in 2), by various mass spectrometric methods in order to deduce the surfactant degradation pathway in principle {{as well as to}} monitor primary and further biodegradation steps. 4) to gather data on the input and fate of surfactants in the aquatic environment under distinct hydrological and climatic conditions by analyzing the parent compounds and their metabolites in wastewaters and surface waters, in part polluted by untreated waste discharges. 5) to pursue the behavior of persistent surfactant metabolites in waterworks preparing drinking water from surface waters and to determine their residues in tap water. 6) to assess deleterious effects of discovered metabolites employing ecotoxicological bioassays. 7) to compare the results obtained from field studies with those from laboratory experiments in order to confirm the environmental relevance of the latter. The selection of target analytes was made taking into account output and novelty on the surfactant market. The substances comprised the detergent ingredients anionic linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS) as the single surfactant with the highest production volume known to yield highly polar metabolites, the two non-ionics alkyl glucamides (AG) and alkyl polyglucosides (APG), as well as the amphoteric surfactant cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPB).

40|$|Fatty alcohol {{derivatives}} {{are used}} as surfactants and applied in commercial formulations like laundry detergents, cleaning agents or cosmetic products as complex mixtures. Different classes of surfactants are combined in formulations to improve {{the properties of the}} product such as cleaning capacity or foam formation. Furthermore, the individual surfactant classes already consist of a complex mixture of homologues because of the raw materials used and the production process. Due to the complexity of this kind of samples, an analytical method is necessary which can detect all individual substances as well as qualify and quantify them. In this work, {{it has been shown that}} complex mixtures consisting of <b>anionic,</b> nonionic and <b>amphoteric</b> surfactants can be separated with HILIC by substance class. Furthermore, a separation by EO homologues was achieved for the ethoxylated substances while a separation by alkyl chain length distribution was only obtained for the betaines. In addition, the application of a reversed phase material showed a very good separation by alkyl chain length distribution whereas the substance classes could not be separated from each other. The use of different organic mobile phases can also lead to a separation by EO homologues, if needed. But exemplified by a special phase material for the analysis of surfactants, it was shown that the onedimensional separation by substance class, alkyl chain length distribution and EO homologues of a complex surfactant mixture leads to coelutions and a very complicated data evaluation. Since the one-dimensional separation did not lead to the desired result, comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LCxLC) was implemented. Firstly, the Neue test was carried out for a closer characterization of the reversed phase materials used. While the separation in the first dimension was performed by polar interactions of a HILIC phase, a C 8 diol phase showed the highest orthogonality when used as second dimension. With this column combination, a separation by substance class and EO homologues was achieved in the first dimension, while the separation in the second dimension led to a further separation by alkyl chain length distribution. Finally, the developed method allowed the separation of about 110 individual substances. The LCxLC method was successfully applied to the analysis of several real samples from the home care sector. Furthermore, analyses for the determination of the reproducibility of peak area and retention time showed that the reproducibility of the retention time in the first dimension is dependent on the retention time. Apart from a small sector in the chromatogram where broad signals were obtained, the reproducibility of the retention time in the first dimension resulted in values below 10 %. The retention time in the second dimension showed a very good reproducibility with a relative standard deviation below 7 % for all substances. Concerning the reproducibility of the peak area, a relative standard deviation below 7 % was achieved for fatty alcohol ethoxylates (FAEO), fatty alcohol ether sulfates (FAES) and betaines. For the fatty alcohol sulfates (FAS) and alkyl polyglucoside (AG), higher values were achieved, which is due to an insufficient and non-reproducible ionisation. Regarding the betaines and fatty alcohol ethoxylates, it was shown that a quantification of the surfactants in complex mixtures is possible with an external calibration or the standard addition method...|$|R
