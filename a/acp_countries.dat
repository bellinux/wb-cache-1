Chief Economist Stern also claimed that poor countries needed to address internal impediments to trade {{if they were to}} benefit from increased world trade. Comment: The implicit assumption in Mr Stern's critique is that an intensification of the current reform will reduce and eliminate the adverse effects of OECD agricultural policies on <b>ACP</b> developing <b>countries.</b> However evidence is emerging that the new reformed instruments of support also have negative effects on <b>ACP</b> developing <b>countries.</b> Unfortunately Mr Stern has little to say about the new external effects of reformed agricultural policies on the various regions of the developing world, an area of increasing importance and concern.

In the Leeward Islands, some of the smallest states in the region, Antigua and St Kitts Nevis are instituting projects to strive for self-sufficiency in major vegetables.

If Antiguan farmers could extend the growing season of their crops so that more local produce is available for more months of the year, they could take a share of a market right on their doorstep worth EC $ 5 - 6 million. Nevis is capable of reducing imports of vegetables by 50 % in the 1990 s and this could be achieved on as little as 150 acres.

After a slight hiccup in growth caused by the El Nino storms of 1997 - 98, according to reports in The Nation newspaper, there are now about 1, 000 hectares under glass. Growers employ between 40, 000 to 50, 000 people, and a similar number are involved in related businesses such as packaging. The success story of this <b>ACP</b> <b>country</b> s horticulture is relative. With foreign ownership dominant, many observers question the amount of economic gain to the country.

Although negotiations on market access in non-agricultural products have been moving forward 'agriculture is extremely politically and culturally sensitive in some key countries'. As a consequence 'finding accommodation will be challenging'. Against this background he maintained that {{the first step is}} to agree by the end of March 2003 on 'the formulae and quantitative targets for further liberalisation in the areas of market access, export subsidisation and domestic support'. Comment: Despite the European Commission's efforts to down play the importance of agricultural trade issues in its communication on trade and development where it argued that today 'at least 70 % of developing country exports consist of manufactured goods' and that trade in agricultural products accounts for only around 10 % of total trade by developing countries, agricultural trade issues are of central importance to the ACP. Overall agricultural exports account for 36 % of ACP exports to the EU. For Africa the importance of agricultural trade with the EU is even greater, with agricultural exports accounting for 50 % of total exports to the EU in 43 % of <b>ACP</b> African <b>countries</b> and agriculture accounting for over 35 % of exports in more than half <b>ACP</b> African <b>countries.</b> Against this background progress in the agricultural component of the WTO negotiations in ways which bring real benefits to all developing <b>countries,</b> including the <b>ACP</b> is essential.
