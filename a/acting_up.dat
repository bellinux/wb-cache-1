25|$|In {{the middle}} of the Rendezvous, McKeag reunites with Pasquinel. The two old {{partners}} happily dance and resolve their old differences. As their friendship reignites with this wild and joyous Scottish dance, Pasquinel collapses in agony. It is the old arrowhead <b>acting</b> <b>up,</b> so McKeag and other trappers undertake a dangerous operation to remove it. They succeed, and McKeag gives the ever-vengeful Jacques the arrowhead. But later on, when the healing Pasquinel asks McKeag to rejoin him so that he won't be alone, McKeag refuses and leaves once again.|$|E
25|$|Adams used email to {{correspond}} with Steve Meretzky in the early 1980s, during their collaboration on Infocom's version of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. While living in New Mexico in 1993 he set up another e-mail address and began posting to his own USENET newsgroup, alt.fan.douglas-adams, and occasionally, when his computer was <b>acting</b> <b>up,</b> to the comp.sys.mac hierarchy. Challenges to the authenticity of his messages later led Adams {{to set up a}} message forum on his own website to avoid the issue. In 1996, Adams was a keynote speaker at the Microsoft Professional Developers Conference (PDC) where he described the personal computer as being a modelling device. The video of his keynote speech is archived on Channel 9.|$|E

500|$|Cloutier {{subsequently}} {{received several}} offers {{to play in}} Europe until signing a tryout contract with the Rockford IceHogs of the AHL in December 2009. He reportedly had received offers from two other North American teams, but chose Rockford as {{the best choice for}} his family. Cloutier made his IceHogs debut on December 6 against the Manitoba Moose, marking his return to professional hockey after 18 months. He played 26 minutes before receiving a match penalty for punching Moose player Guillaume Desbiens after the opposing forward collided with him in his crease. The following day, Cloutier was additionally suspended by the AHL for one game. After serving his ban, he recorded his first win the IceHogs against the Texas Stars on December 12. Cloutier began receiving interest from NHL teams, but his hip began <b>acting</b> <b>up</b> once again. By the end of the month, Cloutier and the IceHogs mutually agreed to terminate his tryout contract. He recorded one win and one loss in three games with the IceHogs, along with a 2.47 GAA and [...]893 save percentage. In a later interview, published on the Canucks' website in August 2010, Cloutier declared he was most likely retiring due to chronic injury troubles.|$|E

2500|$|In 1962, Mantle batted [...]321 in 123 games. He was {{selected}} an All-Star for the eleventh consecutive season and {{played in the}} first game, but due to a former injury <b>acting</b> <b>up,</b> he didn't play in the second All-Star game. In 1963, he batted [...]314 in 65 games. On June 5, he tried to prevent a home run by Brooks Robinson in Baltimore and got his shoe spikes caught in the center field chain link fence as he leaped against the fence for the ball and was coming down. He broke his foot and didn't return playing again until August 4 when he hit a pinch-hit home run against the Baltimore Orioles in Yankee Stadium. He returned to the center field position on September 2. On June 29, he had been selected an All-Star as a starting center fielder, {{but for the first}} time, he didn't make the 25-player team due to the foot injury. In 1964, Mantle hit [...]303 with 35 home runs and 111 RBIs, and played center field in the All-Star game. In {{the bottom of the ninth}} inning of Game 3 of the 1964 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, Mantle blasted Barney Schultz's first pitch into the right field stands at Yankee Stadium, which won the game for the Yankees 2–1. The homer, his 16th World Series round tripper, broke the World Series record of 15 set by Babe Ruth. He hit two more homers in the series to set the existing World Series record of 18 home runs. The Cardinals ultimately won the World Series in 7 games.|$|E

2500|$|Killy {{was born}} on January 26, 1903 in Connecticut. He entered the film {{industry}} as an assistant director at RKO Pictures, his first film being the 1931 musical comedy, Caught Plastered, directed by William Seiter, and starring the comedy duo of Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey. Over {{the next five years}} he assisted on over a dozen films, many of them notable films. In 1932 he was one of two assistants to George Cukor on the drama What Price Hollywood?, starring Constance Bennett and Lowell Sherman. In 1933 he was one of several assistants to Dorothy Arzner on the melodrama Christopher Strong, which featured Katharine Hepburn in her first starring role. He'd work with Hepburn on two more films in 1933, Morning Glory (one of three assisting Lowell Sherman), and one of two assisting Cukor on the classic, Little Women. That year he also assisted Seiter again on another Wheeler & Woolsey comedy, Diplomaniacs, as well as being one of three assistants to Thornton Freeland on the RKO musical Flying Down to Rio, which featured the first on-screen pairing of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The following year Killy assisted Philip Moeller on the classic drama The Age of Innocence, the first talking version of the novel, starring Irene Dunne and John Boles. He would also work with Hepburn again, being one of three assistants to Richard Wallace on The Little Minister. It was during the filming of this movie when Killy gained notoriety by telling off Hepburn. She was <b>acting</b> <b>up</b> on set one day and refusing to take her place on set, so he told her, [...] "Get on the set before you're sent back to New York to do another 'Lake'." [...] However, he soon became one of her favorite assistant directors.|$|E

60|$|Carroll {{felt that}} this was much the kind of {{sentiment}} one could have expected from her; and he did her justice in believing that it was genuine and that she was capable of <b>acting</b> <b>up</b> to her convictions.

[...] "I flew {{in the face of the}} Church's teaching; but I did it without malice prepense. Women are so strange in their influence that they tempt you to misplaced kindness.

6000|$|... "Why not, indeed?" [...] Alan {{echoed in}} turn.
