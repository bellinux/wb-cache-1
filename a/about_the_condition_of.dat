5|$|By 1922, {{concerns}} {{had grown}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> the castle and discussions {{took place between}} the Penard Golf Club, who owned the site, the Royal Institution and the Cambrian Archaeological Association. A joint committee was formed to raise the funds for repairs to the stonework but the costs {{appear to have been}} excessive and instead the gatehouse was patched with concrete between 1923 and 1924. Much of the remaining southern wall collapsed at the beginning of 1960 and an archaeological survey was conducted between 1960 and 1961. Urgent masonry repairs were then carried out in 1963, paid for by a combination of the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works, the Gower Society, the golf club and a public appeal launched by local newspapers.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the {{possibility}} of aftershocks, police evacuated shopping malls and office buildings around the city. Essential organisations in the area were evacuated as a safety precaution, including the police headquarters and offices of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority. At Christchurch International Airport, officials halted operations after the earthquake, but all flights resumed later that day. Months before the event, a severe magnitude 6.3 earthquake occurred in a similar area adjacent to Christchurch, causing widespread destruction and fatalities in the city. Concerns arose <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> previously damaged structures, and the 13 June earthquakes caused further distress among many victims. Dozens of dissatisfied residents were expected {{to move out of the}} city, and many others sought professional help for anxiety and depression-related issues.|$|E

5|$|By now {{the castle}} was in disrepair, and the bailey and the {{earthworks}} {{were covered with}} a combination of pigsties, cabbage gardens and a skittle alley used by a local pub. Local tradition states that the visiting Queen of Portugal, Maria II of Portugal, complained <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> the site to Queen Victoria, which resulted in Hugh Percy, the 3rd Duke of Northumberland and the castle's constable, landscaping the area to create a public park between 1840 and 1842 at a cost of £3,000. The south gatehouse was repaired, and the remains of the north gatehouse turned into stables. Hugh sold off his local interests in 1864 and the Northumberlands' control of the post of constable lapsed with the death of his brother Algernon Percy, the 4th duke, the following year. The post lay vacant until in 1883 the local Member of Parliament, Hardinge Giffard, was appointed as the constable by the then Prince Edward in his capacity as the Duke of Cornwall.|$|E
5|$|Parsons {{was anxious}} to learn <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> his family and {{property}} at Wappocomo; he also needed an additional change of clothing and a blanket. Accompanied by Lieutenant Blue and Adam Parrish, he traveled west along the Northwestern Turnpike to around Pleasant Dale, then followed a series of roads and paths until nighttime, when they reached Sugar Hollow two miles north of Romney. Parsons stayed behind in the hollow, while Blue and Parrish started out for Wappocomo to retrieve a set of Parsons' clothes. Knowing that the Union Army kept a 24-hour guard at the main house, Blue circled around {{to the rear of}} the mansion and knocked on the window of his uncle, Garrett W. Blue, who was residing with the Parsons family. Garrett Blue warned his nephew about the Union Army soldiers possibly stationed on the home's front porch, and he subsequently fetched Parsons' daughter, Kate, who provided Lt. Blue with a parcel for her father.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} epistemic action theory for {{tractable}} epistemic reasoning {{as an extension}} to the h-approximation (HPX) theory. In contrast to existing tractable approaches, the theory supports functional fluents and postdictive reasoning with static causal laws. We argue that this combination is particularly synergistic because it allows one not only to perform direct postdiction <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> actions, but also indirect postdiction <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> static causal laws. We show that despite the richer expressiveness, the temporal projection problem remains tractable (polynomial), and therefore the planning problem remains in NP. We present the operational semantics of our theory {{as well as its}} formulation as Answer Set Programming...|$|R

Thomas points out that Froude comments extensively on the lifestyles of the natives of Grenada when his only experience among the natives was peering into their houses as he rode past in a carriage. Thomas attacks many other different factual inaccuracies in Froude's work.|$|E
25|$|Computer-aided {{detection}} (CADe) {{systems are}} usually confined to marking conspicuous structures and sections. Computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) systems evaluate the conspicuous structures. For example, in mammography CAD highlights microcalcification clusters and hyperdense {{structures in the}} soft tissue. This allows the radiologist to draw conclusions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> the pathology. Another application is CADq, which quantifies, e.g., {{the size of a}} tumor or the tumor's behavior in contrast medium uptake. Computer-aided simple triage (CAST) is another type of CAD, which performs a fully automatic initial interpretation and triage of studies into some meaningful categories (e.g. negative and positive). CAST is particularly applicable in emergency diagnostic imaging, where a prompt diagnosis of critical, life-threatening condition is required.|$|E
25|$|The king {{returned}} to Jerez, assembled his council and informed {{them of the}} state of the city.

He also sent orders to his almogavars to do the same on land. The king's knights advised him about the best places to establish the main base where the King and nobles would live, and the vulnerable points where they could do most damage to the city's defenses. It was only needed to move troops to Algeciras, build bridges over the Barbate River and over a stream near Jerez, and send ships to the Guadalete river to carry food for the troops.|$|E

Miller and another sailor lifted the skipper and, unable to remove him from the bridge, carried him from his exposed position on the damaged bridge to a sheltered spot behind the conning tower.

In 992 the envoy from She-po (Java) arrived in Chinese court and explaining that their country has involved in continuous war with San-fo-qi (Srivijaya). In 999 the Srivijayan envoy sailed from China to Champa in an attempt to return home, however he received no news <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> his country.

25|$|Initially, {{the team}} made {{numerous}} trades and increased their payroll {{in an effort}} to assemble a better team. In one transaction, young players Todd Bertuzzi and Bryan McCabe were traded for veteran Trevor Linden. After the Islanders finished 12 points short of the playoffs in the 1997–98 season, however, Milstein and Gluckstern decided to run the team on an austere budget in an attempt to make a profit. They also complained <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> the Nassau Coliseum and made noises about moving the team elsewhere. They began trading or releasing many popular players to avoid paying their salaries, including star scorer Zigmund Palffy, team captain Linden, former rookie of the year Bryan Berard, and rugged defenseman Rich Pilon. Losing the highly regarded players, the team finished with similar results the next two seasons. Attendance, which had been in a steady decline over the past few years, decreased even further to under 12,000 per game.
