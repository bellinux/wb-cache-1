40|$|The {{prevention}} of seniors´injuries The injuries {{of people at}} seniors age have {{become one of the}} serious issues of today´s medicine, presenting not only the health problem but also the social one. The most seniors´injuries associates with falls and slips. The second main cause for injuries are the traffic accidents, the next one following upon are the accidents, which happen often at home during the casual activities. The intoxication at the old age is not rare either. The {{prevention of}} the falls and potential injuries is based on reduction of hazards of accident occurrence. The prevention, which leads to continuing reduction of the accident rate at seniors age corresponds with the goal no. 5 that is stated in the World Hospital Organization Health 21 " Document. The chosen exploratory method was the quantitative sociologic research based on on-the-spot requiries by the use of question form. The research sample of population consisted from seniors from 65 years old up (130 correspondents) chosen randomly in the region of České Budějovice within the year 2005. The data were all compiled in the Organization For Injuries Preventions in South Bohemia software program. Seniors faced the health hazard and injuries mostly at homes, which are mostly caused by restriction in movements. The most casual ones are the falls. The protective instruments and equipment, which might reduce the injury risks (for example non-barrier entries, <b>skidding</b> <b>devices,</b> bars and so on) still are not the standards for seniors today. The knowledge and understanding the emergancy phone numbers is not sufficient either. The possibilities of prevention for seniors are various, but have not been much exploited yet. It seems the seniors should be firstly adressed by public health employees, which they are in casual contact with and they usually rely on. The topic of prevention of injuries should be also more discussed at education programs destined for seniors...|$|R
40|$|The skid {{resistance}} performance of surface aggregates {{can be assessed}} in the laboratory by using a polishing device {{that is designed to}} simulate traffic polishing actions coupled with a <b>skid</b> resistance measuring <b>device.</b> The standard laboratory test has historically been the Polished Stone Value (PSV) test as specified in BS EN 1097 - 8 : 2009. However, as the technology has advanced and traffic volume and composition on our roads have changed, other devices and methodologies have been developed in an attempt to better assess the {{skid resistance}} performance of surface aggregates. This paper discusses the usage of two alternative laboratory tests, the Auckland Pavement Polishing Device (APPD) and the Wehner/Schulze (WS) devices, to assess the skid resistance performance of three different New Zealand Greywacke aggregates. The paper discusses the variations in APPD and its corresponding <b>skid</b> resistance measuring <b>device,</b> the Dynamic Friction Tester (DFT) and the effect of macrotexture in the APPD-DFT test. The results show that there is a good relationship between the APPD-DFT and the PSV tests, while there is no relationship between the WS and the PSV tests. However, the APPD and the WS tests correlate very well. There are only three Greywacke aggregates used in this research, and hence, no conclusive results can be drawn on the relationship between these laboratory tests as yet...|$|R

The assessment of evolution of pavement surface performance plays {{a fundamental role in}} road pavement management and is useful in order to allocation of maintenance resources. In the light of the above, Authors introduced the first results carried out from a two-year monitoring of an experimental road section.

Several surface performances were measured by different <b>devices</b> (<b>Skid</b> Tester, Sand Patch Test, Laser Profilometer) ...|$|R
40|$|Safety {{is one of}} {{the main}} issues that must be {{considered}} when evaluating the quality of service provided by a road. Therefore, skid resistance measurement procedures are quite important components of a road management system. Currently, many equipments and procedures are used to measure skid resistance in pavement surfaces, like British Pendulum, GripTester, SCRIM, among others. Skid resistance data collected with such devices is afterwards processed and compared against minimum threshold values, predefined for the road management procedures. However, to ensure an acceptable reliability and quality level of such results, continuous monitoring of measurement procedures and also revision and calibration of devices must be performed. In this paper, a general methodology is proposed, to be used as a quality control system for <b>devices</b> and <b>skid</b> resistance measurements. Such methodology has been designed by using checklists, and applying statistical concepts of repeatability and reproducibility. The methodology was therefore applied to evaluate the quality level achieved by <b>skid</b> resistance <b>devices</b> and measurement procedures used in Chile, with good results. The quality of the evaluation procedures included in the methodology were also verified applying Six-Sigma statistical analysis techniques, which contributed significatively to improve the proposed quality control system...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of ROSANNE is the harmonisation and standardisation of {{the measurement of}} skid resistance, noise emission and rolling resistance of road pavements. For skid resistance, many European countries have established thresholds for pavement acceptance and routine monitoring. Past work has led to proposals for harmonisation of European <b>skid</b> resistance <b>devices</b> and, in spite of significant resources expended, {{it has not been}} possible to establish an algorithm that brings the measurement results from all the different devices into a common scale, with the required robustness and accuracy over the full range of operation. The lack of accuracy gives rise to a particular concern for the control and acceptance of newly constructed pavements against contractual specifications and warranty terms. The ROSANNE project proposed that a possible way to achieve an acceptable accuracy is to restrict the range and type of devices, including operating principle and condition. The quality assurance procedures with its several aspects will contribute to a stable common scale over time. While the several parts of the QA-system ensure a proper function of the measuring devices as well as a good comparability of different systems of the same type within one country or even across Europe, depending on the chosen QA-system and its components. Due this such a QA-system can also further support the idea of the common scale. A QA-system can include several checks - starting with just few simple checks up to comprehensive checks and also national or cross-national correlation trials. All the main factors which {{have an impact on the}} measured results should be addressed in a QA-system...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere is a {{wide range}} of routine <b>skid</b> {{resistance}} measurement <b>devices</b> on the market. All of them are measuring the friction force between a rubber wheel and the wetted road surface. Common to all of them is that they are relatively complex and costly because generally a truck carrying a large water tank is needed to wet the surface with a defined water layer. Because of the limited amount of water they can carry they are limited in range. Besides that the measurement is depending on factors like water film thickness, temperature, measurement speed, rubber aging, rubber wear and even road evenness and curviness. All of these factors will affect the skid resistance and are difficult to control. We present a concept of contactless skid resistance measurement which is based on optical texture measurement and consists of two components: measurement of the pavement texture by means of an optical measuring system and calculation of the skid resistance based on the measured texture by means of a rubber friction model. The basic assumptions underlying the theoretical approach and the model itself based on the theory of Persson are presented. The concept is applied to a laboratory device called Wehner/Schulze (W/S) machine to prove the theoretical approach. The results are very promising. A strong indication could be provided that skid resistance could be measured without contact in the future...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} studies have been {{undertaken}} to help predict infield long-term skid resistance performance. The Polished Stone Value (PSV) test is the oldest and the most common test used worldwide to rank the skid resistance performance of road surfaces. Due to certain limitations of the PSV test, other laboratory test methodologies have been developed as potential alternatives. One of the limitations of the PSV test is that it only provides end of test results, whereas it is desirable to observe the skid resistance deterioration trend during the polishing process, in particular for research applications. This paper discusses the application of a mathematical model, originally developed for asphaltic concrete surfaces, to predict the skid resistance deterioration trend under polishing for a range of New Zealand chip seal aggregates. A laboratory <b>skid</b> resistance testing <b>device,</b> known as the Wehner/Schulze device, was used for this study since the model was originally derived based on test results obtained using this type of device. It was found that the model was capable of replicating the skid resistance deterioration trend under laboratory polishing of the chip seal aggregates used in this research. It was also found that the model coefficients were dependent on aggregate geological types, and thus suggested that a set of coefficients obtained for a specific aggregate source may be able to provide information on infield skid resistance performance of that specific aggregate type, if the model is found to be capable of replicating skid resistance deterioration trends in the field as well. As part of future research, the model will be calibrated against infield skid resistance...|$|R
40|$|Skid {{resistance}} measurement and analysis {{is now a}} routine procedure in motor vehicle crash analysis. In fact {{it was one of}} the earliest investigative and analytical tools used for this work. Many different measurement methods are in common use, including: visual estimation assisted by friction tables; various dragged devices with friction force measurement and instrumented vehicle skid-to-rest testing, the last having become the preferred alternative for many investigators over the past decade or so. The <b>skid</b> {{resistance measurement}} <b>devices</b> at present commonly used by traffic engineers for pavement condition monitoring and maintenance intervention, such as SCRIM, ROAR, Griptester and the British Pendulum, are only rarely used for forensic purposes in New Zealand although in some other countries these may be applied as a routine procedure during crash-scene investigations. The interpretation and analysis of the results obtained by skid resistance measurement in the forensic context may seem to be an obvious process but it is not always straightforward. Uncertainties exist and there is considerable scope for fundamental error. The latter is of significant concern, given the potential adverse consequences of an analyst presenting flawed expert testimony in Court. This paper examines the most common skid resistance measuring methods used for forensic purposes and discusses the interpretation and analysis of the results obtained, the uncertainties involved and the expression of expert opinion in Court. It contrasts the differing needs of the forensic analyst and the traffic engineer in this area. It emphasises the need for crash analysts to have a thorough understanding of the physics involved, the empirical data obtained and the relationship between the analysis subsequently performed and the skid resistance measurement method used...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWalking and cycling {{are green}} {{transport}} modes {{which should be}} given more attention in future. The quality of footways is not always very good. In most cities, road managers have difficulties in estimating the quality level of their footway network. Maintenance planning and budgeting are mostly based on ad hoc repairs. The problem {{is the lack of}} a complete evaluation method. After a market survey for different types of measurement equipment, we have combined some ideas to develop an evaluation method for footways. Our approach is based on a network analysis by the manager, with the tool described in this article. Additional information (complaints/defects) is obtained from users, through an application on their smartphones or tablets. The basic idea is that a main inspection is done by the manager at least once a year. An operator travels on a footway with a wheelchair, which is the most “sensitive” type of footway user. This wheelchair is equipped with sensors (of a smartphone) and a <b>skid</b> resistance measuring <b>device.</b> Three parameters (comfort/longitudinal unevenness in the direction of travel, gradient in the direction of travel, and crossfall) can be measured in one run, and a skid resistance measurement is made in each section of the network. In total we will thus have four technical indicators and the feedback from the user. All this information will help the road manager to maintain his footway network. We are open to refine this kind of application in consultation with the wheelchair community, using their feedback on the quality of footways. A similar exercise could be done for cycle tracks. The article will explain the idea behind the method suggested for the evaluation of footways at the network level...|$|R
40|$|AbstractROSANNE is a collaborative {{project in}} the Seventh EU Framework Programme which aims at developing/harmonising {{measurement}} methods for skid resistance, noise emission and rolling resistance of road pavements as a preparation for standardization. To achieve this, the project is following the recommendations of key predecessor projects like TYROSAFE, HERMES, SILVIA, SILENCE and MIRIAM as well as considering the ongoing work in CEN and ISO groups. Work package 1 deals with skid resistance and aims at the harmonization of skid resistance measurement following the TYROSAFE Roadmap, by deriving conversion factors for friction indices based on similar groups of devices, namely longitudinal and sideways <b>skid</b> resistance measurement <b>devices.</b> During the first project year a first round robin test {{was carried out in}} Nantes, ten different devices participated to the test. The results of this test are collected in report D 1. 2 “Analysis of data from the first round of tests and initial development of the common scale”. Work package 2 is dealing with the pavement influence on road traffic noise emission: the main objective of this work package is to combine the existing measurement methods of SPB (ISO 11819 - 1) and CPX (ISO/DIS 11819 - 2) into a stable and reliable harmonised pavement noise emission characterisation method. The project is validating procedure incorporating correction mechanisms for temperature influence and investigating its potential use for noise calculation methods like the one proposed by the CNOSSOS-EU project. Work package 3 is dealing with rolling resistance, where the ROSANNE project is mainly building on the results obtained in the MIRIAM project and is considering standardized trailer measurements of rolling resistance coefficients of road surfaces. After a first report D 3. 1 “State of the art on rolling resistance measurement devices including draft standard outline” the following main report was produced “Parameters influencing rolling resistance and possible correction procedures”. In the frame of work package 4 the project is also exploring the potential for developments in the measurement of surface texture in order to find out parameters that better reflect the physical process of tyre/road interaction and that may improve the understanding of how the texture influences noise emission, skid resistance and rolling resistance. In addition to that this work package is also investigating the performance of reference tyres and pavements which are necessary for the measurement of all three road surface properties. The present paper summarizes the project status after the first 18 project months...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of ROSANNE is the harmonisation and standardisation of {{the measurement of}} skid resistance, noise emission and rolling resistance of road pavements. Controlling these road surface parameters enables road administrations to make a beneficial contribution to making road transport safer and greener. Currently, the measurement methods and policies vary greatly across Europe, leading to the situation that while their importance is recognized, the exchange of expertise and good practice among EU countries faces considerable barriers. Ultimately this leads to barriers facing companies that wish to trade {{in more than one}} country due to the difficulties in interpreting the technical requirements for the provision of goods and services (which in this case are the supply of road surfacing materials and the provision of road survey services), and the inefficiency of requiring different physical equipment for making measurements. For skid resistance, many European countries have established thresholds for pavement acceptance and routine monitoring that are linked to devices that originated from national development and also to many years of experience of the performance of pavement materials when newly constructed and in-service. Past work has led to proposals for harmonisation of European <b>skid</b> resistance <b>devices</b> and, in spite of significant resources expended, it has not been possible to establish an algorithm that brings the measurement results from all the different devices into a common scale, with the required robustness and accuracy over the full range of operation. The lack of accuracy gives rise to a particular concern for the control and acceptance of newly constructed pavements against contractual specifications and warranty terms. The ROSANNE project proposed that a possible way to achieve an acceptable accuracy is to restrict the range and type of devices, including operating principle and condition. In this way, different measurement classes can be introduced, associated with achieving different levels of accuracy, and where restrictions on the type of devices and the operating conditions are identified so that the accuracy of each class is complied with. Moreover, it was proposed to organize round robin tests between some European friction devices to develop this friction index. Two experimental campaigns were proposed: the first one to build the common scale and the second one to check its stability with other friction devices. This report analyses the data obtained from the second round of tests and compares it to the results from the first trial. The common scale for friction measurements in Europe is also developed further along with an assessment of its stability over time. The first campaign of skid-resistance measurement was executed in May 2014 in Nantes in France with the second trial being held at the same location in April 2015. The round robin tests were carried out on the IFSTTAR test tracks and on trafficked roads around the IFSTTAR facility. As with the first trial the tests were in two parts: one week for devices measuring longitudinal friction coefficient and another week for devices measuring side-force friction coefficient. To limit the differences due to seasonal variations, the tests were carried out on two consecutive weeks. Three groups of devices form the basis for the harmonisation exercise to be executed in the ROSANNE project, with a Common Scale to be established within each of the following groups: 1) Side-force measurement (devices with 20 degree wheel angle, 34 % slip); 2) Longitudinal force measurement with low slip ratios (devices with 15 - 25 % slip, close to peak friction); 3) Longitudinal force measurement with high slip ratios (devices with over 60 % slip). The 2015 test program incorporated all the devices that had taken part in the first trial, but also additional devices from both the side-force and longitudinal measurement groups. The additional devices were identified from an invitation through CEN, but for logistical reasons not all the devices that expressed an interest were able to be accommodated. Selection was therefore based on devices that were covered by a CEN Technical Specification and then on a first come first served basis. The complete test program allows for calibration of the Common Scale over a range of skid resistance levels and a test of its robustness on surface types and measurement conditions that are representative of the roads in Europe. Analysis of the data from the first round of tests had shown that measurements made by different devices can be converted to a common scale based on the SRI approach outlined in CEN TS 13036 - 2 (CEN, 2010). In addition the assumptions made in developing the TYROSAFE roadmap were proven correct in that the precision of the common scale is improved by developing a common scale for different groups of devices based on their operating principle...|$|R
