5|$|A fifteen-year {{analysis}} {{published in}} 2011, Body Piercing <b>and</b> <b>Identity</b> Construction found that public piercing {{served as a}} mechanism of both accelerated camaraderie and political communication, while private piercings served to enhance sexuality and contest heteronormativity.|$|E
50|$|Queer {{theory has}} {{increasingly}} been applied {{not just to}} contemporary sexualities <b>and</b> <b>identities</b> but also to practices <b>and</b> <b>identities</b> in earlier time periods.

40|$|This paper {{reviewed}} the relationship existing between {{the recognition of}} emotional expressions <b>and</b> <b>identities</b> in faces. First, we {{reviewed the}} studies which suggested that the recognition of expressions <b>and</b> <b>identities</b> was mediated through independent processes. Although this hypothesis of independence was supported in several areas of research, recent studies suggested that two of these processes were not completely independent. Therefore, we reviewed the studies which supported {{the idea that there}} was an interaction of the processing of expressions <b>and</b> <b>identities.</b> Finally, we argued that future studies should focus on the individual differences of the interaction of expressions <b>and</b> <b>identities</b> using a selective attention paradigm to contribute to the issues of social communication...|$|R
40|$|In many {{adolescent}} developmental models, it {{is proposed}} {{that having a}} clear <b>and</b> positive <b>identity</b> is an important developmental task for adolescents. In this paper, the conception of positive <b>and</b> healthy <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> the related theories are outlined and the determinants and effects of having a positive <b>and</b> healthy <b>identity</b> are presented. The relationship between healthy <b>and</b> positive <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> leadership is then explored. Finally, the question of knowing how positive <b>and</b> healthy <b>identity</b> can be promoted is examined. Issues surrounding the ways of how to teach students to develop the attribute of having a clear <b>and</b> positive <b>identity</b> as a leader are discussed.

5|$|Another {{closely related}} theme is the arts—most often theater, but also music and film itself. In several of Szabó’s films—most famously in Mephisto—artists become {{caught up in}} {{conflicts}} around politics, role-playing, <b>and</b> <b>identity.</b>|$|E
5|$|As aforementioned, {{while its}} exact origins are unknown, gumbo is often {{believed}} to be a dish created by slaves, made from slave owners’ unwanted food materials, such as animal innards or fatty cuts. African-American slaves often exchanged or combined ingredients {{in order to make the}} dish, allowing it to serve as a means of community <b>and</b> <b>identity</b> among them.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} strepsirrhine primates, {{olfactory}} communication is used extensively by ruffed lemurs – scent marking in territorial defense and disputes, {{as well as}} female greeting displays. The scents communicate the sex, location, <b>and</b> <b>identity</b> of their owner.|$|E
40|$|Alongside {{the role}} of the teacher-as-researcher {{specifically}} in low SES communities, we are interested in the alternative discourses <b>and</b> <b>identities</b> that become possible in “figured worlds” where teachers are positioned, and position themselves, as researchers. We consider the questions: What discourses, artefacts <b>and</b> <b>identities</b> are typically associated with low SES schools? What is/could be distinctive about teacher research in low SES settings? How might teacher research in low SES settings contribute to the production of alternative discourses and learner/teacher relationships <b>and</b> <b>identities...</b>|$|R

40|$|Sexual {{identity}} is a multidimensional construct that includes sex identity, gender <b>identity,</b> socio-sexual <b>identity,</b> <b>and</b> erotic <b>identity.</b> Sexual <b>identity</b> has theoretical <b>and</b> practical implications for sexual and reproductive health. For adults, concordance among biological sex, gender <b>and</b> role <b>identity,</b> <b>and</b> erotic <b>identity</b> is expected. However, 10 % {{of the general}} population reports itself as non-heterosexual and another significant percent shows discordant sexual behavior with sexual identity. This narrative review clarifies the concepts of sexual identity, gender <b>identity,</b> socio-sexual <b>identity,</b> <b>and</b> erotic <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> presents some practical issues of an inappropriate use of these constructs in public health...|$|R
5|$|Diagnosed with acral lentiginous {{melanoma}} in 1977, Marley died on 11 May 1981 in Miami at age 36. He was {{a committed}} Rastafari who infused his music {{with a sense of}} spirituality.

5|$|Kinky Boots adds to {{the public}} {{discourse}} of gender, and its flexibility and fluidity. The prevalence of drag culture in mainstream media has introduced a step of separation between femininity and “being female”. While the show preaches a message of acceptance, this separation of impersonation <b>and</b> <b>identity</b> can cause issues for the transgender community.|$|E
40|$|Several authors (Frijda, Manstead, & Bem, 2000; Van Veen & Lasky, 2006) {{suggest that}} emotions, cognitions, <b>and</b> <b>identities</b> are {{intrinsically}} related. Authors in social psychology (Fiedler & Bless, 2000; Frijda, Manstead, & Bem, 2000; Rosiek, 2003) have considered how beliefs are particularly sensitive to affective influences and how emotions, cognitions, <b>and</b> <b>identities</b> are intrinsically related. Understanding this relationship would help researchers to reveal complex key issues in beliefs research, {{such as the}} relationship between beliefs and action. Yet, although research on beliefs in applied linguistics {{goes back to the}} 70 s and 80 s, there has been scant connection with emotions <b>and</b> <b>identities.</b> This paper aims to reflect on the relationship between beliefs, emotions, <b>and</b> <b>identities</b> by looking at these coconstructing, overlapping concepts to advance our understanding of language learning and teaching. Through a review of studies on beliefs, emotions, <b>and</b> <b>identities</b> within applied linguistics and other areas, I illustrate how beliefs and emotions are intrinsically and interactively related, and how beliefs within a socio-historical context influence the construction of identities. Identities influence the kinds of emotions and beliefs that individuals attribute to themselves and to others. Emotions, in turn, can influence <b>identities</b> <b>and</b> how we construct them. Implications for research on beliefs, emotions, <b>and</b> <b>identities</b> are suggested. 523013256 Studies in Second Language Learning and Teachin...|$|R

5|$|Circumstantial {{evidence}} supporting the social pre-wiring hypothesis can be revealed when examining newborns' behavior. Newborns, not even hours after birth, {{have been found}} to display a preparedness for social interaction. This preparedness is expressed in ways such as their imitation of facial gestures. This observed behavior cannot be contributed to any current form of socialization or social construction. Rather, newborns most likely inherit to some extent social behavior <b>and</b> <b>identity</b> through genetics.|$|E
5|$|Educator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book Stories of Resilience in Childhood, {{analyzed}} {{the events in}} Caged Bird to illustrate resiliency in children. Challener states that Angelou's book provides a useful framework for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya face and how a community helps these children succeed as Angelou did. Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has used Caged Bird to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of child development topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, <b>and</b> <b>identity</b> formation in adolescence. He has called the book a highly effective tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a period}} of {{personal}} and legal troubles with drug addiction, Gil Scott-Heron recorded and released his first album of original material in sixteen years, I'm New Here (2010), {{with the assistance of}} XL Recordings-label head Richard Russell. Produced by Russell, the album served as a departure from Scott-Heron's earlier work, both musically and thematically, eschewing its soul, jazz, and funk styles and social commentary for more personal, reflective lyrics with ruminations on love, loss, <b>and</b> <b>identity,</b> set to contemporary electronic music. It was well received by fans and music critics, who viewed it as a comeback for Scott-Heron.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, Davies {{completed}} his O-Levels and stayed at Olchfa with the ambition to study English literature at the University of Oxford; he abandoned his aspirations {{of becoming a}} comic artist after a careers advisor convinced him that his colour-blindness would make that path unlikely. During his studies, he participated in the WGYTC's assignments to create Welsh-language drama to be performed at the National Eisteddfod of Wales, including Pair Dadeni, a play based on the Mabinogion myth cycle, and Perthyn, a drama about community belonging <b>and</b> <b>identity</b> in early-1980s West Glamorgan. In 1981, he was accepted by Worcester College, Oxford to study English literature. At Oxford, he realised that he was enamoured with the narrative aspect of fiction, especially 19th-century literature such as Charles Dickens.|$|E
5|$|Like the game, {{the comic}} {{is set in}} a post-apocalyptic world, overrun by zombie-like creatures {{infected}} by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. The comics serve as a prequel to the game, chronicling the journey of the young Ellie and her meeting with another young survivor, Riley Abel. Druckmann chose Ellie as the focus of the comic due to the uniqueness of her birth and upbringing in the post-apocalyptic world. Hicks joined the project after discovering Ellie's role in the game, considering her an unusual character to include in a survival horror game. The comic's art style is different than the game art—a choice from Hicks to give the comic a unique feel <b>and</b> <b>identity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many petroglyphs or carved {{images of}} dogs were found near {{religious}} centers and chiefly residential areas indicating their venerated status and {{importance in the}} culture. A survey by American archaeologist Sidsel N. Millerstrom noted {{that a majority of}} dog petroglyphs have been found in the valleys of ʻAʻakapa, Haʻatuatua, and Hatiheu on the northern coast of Nuku Hiva, the meʻae Vaikivi on Ua Huka, and the meʻae Iʻipona and Eiaone Valley on Hiva Oa. Their regional distributions possibly reflected the role of dogs as symbols of tribal/clan loyalty <b>and</b> <b>identity</b> in the islands. They were totem animals associated with the Nakiʻi tribe.|$|E
