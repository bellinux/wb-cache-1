50|$|Phrumsengla is a {{temperate}} {{park with}} {{large tracts of}} old-growth fir forests, its altitudes ranging from 700 m to 4,400 m. Phrumsengla is home to six species of threatened birds: the rufous-necked hornbill (<b>Aceros</b> <b>nipalensis),</b> rufous-throated wren-babbler (Spelaeornis caudatus), satyr tragopan (Tragopan satyra), beautiful nuthatch (Sitta formosa), Ward's trogon (Harpactes wardi) and Chestnut-breasted partridge (Arborophila mandellii), {{as well as the}} near-threatened wedge billed wren babbler (Sphenocichla humei). Phrumsengla has scenic views, including forests ranging with elevations from alpine to sub-tropical. Because the soil of Phrumsengla's biomes is particularly fragile, the land is unsuitable for logging or other development.|$|R
50|$|The 126,880 hectare Phou Dendin Important Bird Area (IBA) {{is located}} within the 222,000 hectare Phou Dene Din NBCA. The IBA {{altitude}} varies between 500 - 1900 m above sea level. Topographical elements include the Nam Ou River and its catchment, the area at {{the confluence of the}} Nam Khang River, mountainous terrain, and slopes. The habitat is characterized by unbroken dry evergreen forest and inland wetlands. Notable avifauna includes Blyth's kingfisher (Alcedo hercules), brown dipper (Cinclus pallasii), brown hornbill (Anorrhinus tickelli), crested kingfisher (Megaceryle lugubris), great hornbill (Buceros bicornis), lesser fish eagle (Ichthyophaga humilis), and rufous-necked hornbill (<b>Aceros</b> <b>nipalensis).</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 270 {{bird species}} have been {{recorded}} in the park. From the 270 recorded birds, eight are Globally threatened and thus fall under Schedule I of the FNCA, 1995. Phobjikha Valley, which falls in the buffer zone of the park {{is also a very}} important winter habitat for the migrating black-necked cranes. The park is also a very important habitat of the critically endangered white-bellied herons in Bhutan. Places such as Tingtibi and Nabji-Korphu is a very important habitat of the rufous-necked hornbill (<b>Aceros</b> <b>nipalensis).</b> The park is also a home to the populations of endangered great hornbill and wood snipe.|$|R
50|$|The Phou Louey Massif IBA {{is in the}} Nam Et-Phou Louey NBCA and {{adjacent}} to the Nam Neun IBA. The Phou Louey IBA stretches beyond Houaphanh Province into Luang Prabang Province. It is 60,070 ha in size and is {{at an altitude of}} 700 - 1800 m above sea level. The habitat is characterized as mixed deciduous forest, semi-evergreen forest, lower montane evergreen forest, upper montane evergreen forest, and secondary grassland. Key avifauna include beautiful nuthatch (Sitta formosa), rufous-necked hornbill (<b>Aceros</b> <b>nipalensis),</b> Blyth's kingfisher (Alcedo hercules), and yellow-vented warbler (Phylloscopus cantator). There are four confirmed species of turtles and two confirmed species of ungulate.|$|R
2500|$|The {{conservation}} area or habitat in the Phobhjikha Valley, established in 2003 has, {{not only the}} black-necked cranes, but also 13 other vulnerable species such as rufous-necked hornbill <b>Aceros</b> <b>nipalensis,</b> chestnut-breasted partridge Arborophila mandellii, Pallas's fish eagle Haliaeetus leucoryphus, nuthatch Sitta Formosa, wood snipe Gallinago nemoricola, Blyth's tragopan Tragopan blythii, greater spotted eagle Clanga clanga, imperial eagle Aquila heliaca, Baer's pochard Aythya baeri, Hodgson's bushchat Saxicola insignis, dark-rumped swift Apus acuticauda, and grey-crowned prinia Prinia cinereocapilla. The black-necked cranes arrive in this valley in late October and depart in mid February. They feed on the particular type of dwarf bamboos that grow in the wetlands of the valley. The thick grasslands of wetlands are also grazing grounds for {{a large number of}} cattle and horses during the summer months that helps the growth of the tender bamboo shoots on which the cranes feed later during the winter season. There were suggestions that the wetlands be drained and used to grow cash crops such as potatoes, which is also the main crop of the valley. Such an action would have deprived the cranes of their main feeding centres. However, Palje [...] "Benjie" [...] Dorji, former Chief Justice of Bhutan, former Minister for Environment and uncle of the present King of Bhutan, as the Chairman of the Royal Bhutan Society and as founder of the Black-necked Conservation Programme prevailed on the Government of Bhutan to drop the proposal to drain the wetlands of the Phobjika Valley to create farms to grow cash rich seed potatoes.|$|R
40|$|The loss of {{tropical}} forests and associated biodiversity {{is a global}} concern. Conservation efforts in tropical countries such as India have mostly focused on state-administered protected areas despite the existence of vast tracts of forest outside these areas. We studied hornbills (Bucerotidae), an ecologically important vertebrate group and a flagship for tropical forest conservation, to assess the importance of forests outside protected areas in Arunachal Pradesh, north-east India. We conducted a state-wide survey to record encounters with hornbills in seven protected areas, six state-managed reserved forests and six community-managed unclassed forests. We estimated the density of hornbills in one protected area, four reserved forests and two unclassed forests in eastern Arunachal Pradesh. The state-wide survey showed that the mean rate of encounter of rufous-necked hornbills <b>Aceros</b> <b>nipalensis</b> was four times higher in protected areas than in reserved forests and 22 times higher in protected areas than in unclassed forests. The mean rate of encounter of wreathed hornbills Rhyticeros undulatus was twice as high in protected areas as in reserved forests and eight times higher in protected areas than in unclassed forests. The densities of rufous-necked hornbill were higher inside protected areas, whereas the densities of great hornbill Buceros bicornis and wreathed hornbill were similar inside and outside protected areas. Key informant surveys revealed possible extirpation of some hornbill species at sites in two protected areas and three unclassed forests. These results highlight a paradoxical situation where individual populations of hornbills are being lost even in some legally protected habitat, whereas they continue to persist {{over most of the}} landscape. Better protection within protected areas and creative community-based conservation efforts elsewhere are necessary to maintain hornbill populations in this biodiversity-rich region...|$|R
