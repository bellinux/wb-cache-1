5|$|A series frontiersmen {{assemblies}} {{were held}} {{over several years}} across the Willamette Valley, with many on the French Prairie at Champoeg. The death of prominent settler Ewing Young on 9 February 1841, who left neither a will or had an heir in Oregon Country, left the future of his property uncertain. Jason Lee chaired the first meeting organised {{to discuss the matter}} on the 17th. He proposed the creation of an authority over the pioneers centered on a governor. French-Canadian settlers blocked the measure and instead a probate judge <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>other</b> positions were appointed.|$|E

The nictitating membrane also covers {{the eye and}} acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. With the exception of pigeons <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>other</b> species, most birds blink only with their nictitating membrane, and when not sleeping, use the eyelids chiefly only when the eye is threatened with some foreign matter.|$|E

5|$|First {{mentioned}} {{during the}} 17th century, the Rodrigues solitaire {{was described in}} detail by François Leguat, {{the leader of a}} group of French Huguenot refugees who were marooned on Rodrigues in 1691–1693. It was hunted by humans and introduced animals, and was extinct by the late 18th century. Apart from Leguat's account and drawing, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>other</b> contemporary descriptions, nothing was known about the bird until a few subfossil bones were found in a cave in 1789. Thousands of bones have subsequently been excavated. It is the only extinct bird with a former star constellation named after it, Turdus Solitarius.|$|E
5|$|Fish ovaries may be {{of three}} types: gymnovarian, {{secondary}} gymnovarian or cystovarian. In the first type, the oocytes are released directly into the coelomic cavity and then enter the ostium, then through the oviduct and are eliminated. Secondary gymnovarian ovaries shed ova into the coelom from which they go directly into the oviduct. In the third type, the oocytes are conveyed to the exterior through the oviduct. Gymnovaries are the primitive condition found in lungfish, sturgeon, and bowfin. Cystovaries characterize most teleosts, where the ovary lumen has continuity with the oviduct. Secondary gymnovaries are found in salmonids <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>other</b> teleosts.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the general}} {{capitulation}} of TSAM, {{the remnants of}} the 19th Mechanized Division surrendered to the Germans at Serres in the afternoon of 10 April, while {{the remnants of the}} Krousia Detachment did so near Thessaloniki. The division's commander, chief of staff, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>other</b> officers chose instead to withdraw to the area of Chalkidiki. Apart from sending detachments, 191st Regiment did not participate en masse in battle. As soon as news came of the fall of Thessaloniki, the regiment moved to Stavros, where it disintegrated, with its men dispersing across Chalkidiki. This signalled the end of the division and its major sub-units as coherent fighting forces.|$|E

They release Ghost from his nearby pen and take Jon's body into a store-room, whereupon Melisandre briefly visits and is troubled, as she had experienced a vision in the flames where Jon was fighting at Winterfell. The loyalists become fearful and also lock themselves in from the mutineers, {{with the exception of}} Edd, who sneaks out of Castle Black to get assistance from the Wildlings against the mutineers.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Prince Sadruddin, {{together}} with Denis de Rougemont <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>other</b> friends, established a Geneva-based think-tank, Groupe de Bellerive (named after Bellerive, the municipality {{where he lived}} in Geneva), and a non-profit organisation, the Bellerive Foundation. The foundation collaborated with international institutions, British and Scandinavian bilateral aid organizations, and other NGOs such as the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). It became a leading grassroots action group promoting environmental protection, natural resource conservation and the safeguarding of life in all its forms.|$|E

By the time Barnard was beginning to focus his efforts on tying the two forts into an entire interlocking system of fortifications, his engineers were drawn off by the approach of the Confederate Army and the incipient Battle of Bull Run.|$|E

No. 1 of the Lewis gun team opened fire but was shot almost immediately, whereupon the rifleman pushed the dead man off the gun, opened fire, knocked out the enemy gun crew and then silenced the fire of the enemy bombers and riflemen in front of him. During the {{remainder}} of the day he did magnificent work and finally assisted with covering fire in the withdrawal, until the enemy were close on him.|$|E
5|$|The Ionians {{sought to}} defend Miletus by sea, leaving {{the defense of}} Miletus to the Milesians. The Ionian fleet {{gathered}} at the island of Lade, {{off the coast of}} Miletus. The Persians were uncertain of victory at Lade, so attempted to persuade some of the Ionian contingents to defect. Although this was unsuccessful at first, when the Persians finally attacked the Ionians, the Samian fleet accepted the Persian offer. As the Persian and Ionian fleets met, the Samians sailed away from the battle, causing the collapse of the Ionian battle line. Although the Chian contingent <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>other</b> ships remained and fought bravely against the Persians, the battle was lost.|$|E

5|$|The {{genesis of}} the project came in 1998 as Pixar was {{finishing}} work on A Bug's Life. At that time Jorgen Klubien began writing a new script called The Yellow Car, about an electric car living in a gas-guzzling world. Some of the original drawings and characters were produced in 1998 and the producers agreed that Cars {{could be the next}} movie after A Bug's Life and would be released in early 1999, particularly around June 4. However, the movie was eventually scrapped in favor of Toy Story 2. Later, production resumed with major script changes, like giving Mater, Doc, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>other</b> characters a bigger part.|$|E

5|$|The revolutionary {{executive}} left Islaz at {{the head}} of a gathering of soldiers and various others, and, after passing through Caracal, triumphantly entered Craiova without meeting resistance from local forces. According to one account, the gathering comprised as many as 150,000 armed civilians. As these events were unfolding, Bibescu was shot at in Bucharest by Alexandru or Iancu Paleologu (the father of French diplomat Maurice Paléologue) and his co-conspirators, whose bullets only managed to tear one of the Prince's epaulettes. Over the following hours, police forces clamped down of Frăția, arresting Rosetti <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>other</b> members, but failing to capture most of them.|$|E
5|$|After {{showing the}} game at the Macworld Expo, Bungie was mobbed with {{interest}} and orders for the game. The game was not finished until December 14, 1994; Jones <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>other</b> employees spent a day at a warehouse assembling boxes so {{that some of the}} orders could be filled before Christmas. The game was a critical and commercial success, and is regarded as a relatively unknown but important part of gaming history. It served as the Mac alternative to DOS PC-only games like Doom and System Shock. The game's volume of orders was unprecedented for the studio, who found that its old method of mail or phone orders could not scale to the demand and hired another company to handle {{the tens of thousands of}} orders. Marathon also brought Bungie attention from press outside the small Mac gaming market.|$|E
5|$|After {{the close}} of the session, Sherman {{returned}} to Ohio to campaign for the Republican nominee for governor there, former governor Rutherford B. Hayes. The issue of specie payments was debated in the campaign, with Hayes endorsing Sherman's position and his Democratic opponent, incumbent Governor William Allen, in favor of increased circulation of greenbacks redeemable in bonds. Hayes won a narrow victory and was soon mentioned as a possible presidential candidate in 1876. The controversy over resumption carried into the presidential election. The Democratic platform that year demanded repeal of the Resumption Act, while the Republicans nominated Hayes, whose position in favor of a gold standard was well known. The election of 1876 was very close, and the electoral votes of several states were ardently disputed until mere days before the new president was to be inaugurated. Louisiana was one of the states in which both parties claimed victory, and Grant asked Sherman <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>other</b> men to go to New Orleans and ensure the party's interests were represented.|$|E
