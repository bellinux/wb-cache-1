25|$|In 1998 General-Major Radislav Krstić {{was indicted}} for genocide, crimes against {{humanity}} and violations of the laws or customs of war, based on his alleged role in the events {{in and around the}} Bosniak enclave of Srebrenica between 11 July 1995 and 1 November 1995 at the ICTY. On August 2, 2001, after the Trial Chamber was convinced beyond any reasonable doubt that a crime of genocide was committed in Srebrenica, it had convicted Krstić of genocide, who became the first person thus convicted before the Tribunal, and sentenced him to 46 years in prison. The Appeals Chamber had, after upholding the Trial Chamber's finding that Bosnian Serb forces had carried out genocide in Srebrenica, among other things, reduced Krstić’s responsibility for genocide and for the murder of the Bosnian Muslims from that of a direct participant to that of an <b>aider</b> <b>and</b> <b>abettor,</b> and shortened his sentence to 35 years in prison. Krsić was subsequently transferred to the United Kingdom to serve his prison sentence at Wakefield Prison, but was later transferred to Long Lartin Prison.|$|E
2500|$|Vinko Pandurević - {{found guilty}} of aiding and abetting {{violations}} of the laws or customs of war and crimes against humanity. He was also {{found guilty of}} failing to prevent and punish the crimes of his subordinates. The chamber granted the prosecution’s appeal regarding a variety of incidents, and entered {{a number of new}} convictions. Pandurević was thus found guilty as an <b>aider</b> <b>and</b> <b>abettor</b> or through command responsibility, in relation to various criminal acts, of murder as a violation of the laws or customs of war, extermination as a crime against humanity, and persecution through murder and through cruel and inhumane treatment as a crime against humanity. The chamber entered new convictions for these crimes, and also set aside some of Pandurević’s convictions at trial. In dismissing one of Pandurević’s challenges regarding aiding and abetting, the chamber recalled that [...] "specific direction" [...] is not an element of aiding and abetting under customary international law. His sentence of 13 years of imprisonment was affirmed.|$|E

The cruelty of which he had been an unwilling witness, the coarse and ruffianly behaviour of Squeers even in his best moods, the filthy place, the sights and sounds about him, all contributed to this state of feeling; but when he recollected that, being there as an assistant, he actually seemed--no matter what unhappy train of circumstances had brought him to that pass--to be the <b>aider</b> <b>and</b> <b>abettor</b> of a system which filled him with honest disgust and indignation, he loathed himself, and felt, for the moment, as though the mere consciousness of his present situation must, through all time to come, prevent his raising his head again.|$|E

This Miggs was a tall young lady, very much addicted to pattens in private life; slender and shrewish, of a rather uncomfortable figure, and though not absolutely ill-looking, of a sharp and acid visage. As a general principle and abstract proposition, Miggs held the male sex to be utterly contemptible and unworthy of notice; to be fickle, false, base, sottish, inclined to perjury, and wholly undeserving. When particularly exasperated against them (which, scandal said, was when Sim Tappertit slighted her most) she was accustomed to wish with great emphasis that the whole race of women could but die off, in order that the men might be brought to know the real value of the blessings by which they set so little store; nay, her feeling for her order ran so high, that she sometimes declared, if she could only have good security for a fair, round number--say ten thousand--of young virgins following her example, she would, to spite mankind, hang, drown, stab, or poison herself, with a joy past all expression.|$|E

60|$|Having related these anecdotes in {{a natural}} manner, which was the best {{warranty}} {{in the world for}} their genuine nature, our friend Waterloo was sinking deep into his shawl again, as having exhausted his communicative powers and taken in enough east wind, when my other friend Pea in a moment brought him to the surface by asking whether he had not been occasionally the subject of assault and battery in the execution of his duty? Waterloo recovering his spirits, instantly dashed into a new branch of his subject. We learnt how 'both these teeth' - here he pointed to the places where two front teeth were not - were knocked out by an ugly customer who one night made a dash at him (Waterloo) while his (the ugly customer's) pal and coadjutor made a dash at the toll-taking apron where the money-pockets were; how Waterloo, letting the teeth go (to Blazes, he observed indefinitely), grappled with the apron- seizer, permitting the ugly one to run away; and how he saved the bank, and captured his man, and consigned him to fine and imprisonment. Also how, on another night, 'a Cove' laid hold of Waterloo, then presiding at the horse-gate of his bridge, and threw him unceremoniously over his knee, having first cut his head open with his whip. How Waterloo 'got right,' and started after the Cove all down the Waterloo Road, through Stamford Street, and round to the foot of Blackfriars Bridge, where the Cove 'cut into' a public-house. How Waterloo cut in too; but how an <b>aider</b> <b>and</b> <b>abettor</b> of the Cove's, who happened to be taking a promiscuous drain at the bar, stopped Waterloo; and the Cove cut out again, ran across the road down Holland Street, and where not, and into a beer-shop. How Waterloo breaking away from his detainer was close upon the Cove's heels, attended by no end of people, who, seeing him running with the blood streaming down his face, thought something worse was 'up,' and roared Fire! and Murder! on the hopeful chance of the matter in hand being one or both. How the Cove was ignominiously taken, in a shed where he had run to hide, and how at the Police Court they at first wanted to make a sessions job of it; but eventually Waterloo was allowed to be 'spoke to,' and the Cove made it square with Waterloo by paying his doctor's bill (W. was laid up for a week) and giving him 'Three, ten.' Likewise we learnt what we had faintly suspected before, that your sporting amateur on the Derby day, albeit a captain, can be - 'if he be,' as Captain Bobadil observes, 'so generously minded' - anything but a man of honour and a gentleman; not sufficiently gratifying his nice sense of humour by the witty scattering of flour and rotten eggs on obtuse civilians, but requiring the further excitement of 'bilking the toll,' and 'Pitching into' Waterloo, and 'cutting him about the head with his whip;' finally being, when called upon to answer for the assault, what Waterloo described as 'Minus,' or, as I humbly conceived it, not to be found. Likewise did Waterloo inform us, in reply to my inquiries, admiringly and deferentially preferred through my friend Pea, that the takings at the Bridge had more than doubled in amount, since the reduction of the toll one half. And being asked if the aforesaid takings included much bad money, Waterloo responded, with a look far deeper than the deepest part of the river, HE should think not! - and so retired into his shawl {{for the rest of the}} night.|$|E

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the Great Depression, the federal {{securities}} laws operated to mandate disclosure of material facts to investors and extend broad private remedies to victims of securities fraudfeasors. The revelation of massive securities fraud underlying the Great Depression animated the federal securities laws as investment plunged after 1929 and failed to recover for years. For over sixty years after the enactment of the federal securities laws, no episode of massive securities fraud with significant macroeconomic harm occurred. The federal securities laws thereby operated to facilitate financial stability and prosperity, in addition to a superior allocation of capital. Unfortunately, as memories faded and inequality soared, corporate and financial elites (with the active aid of lawmakers) launched a sustained attack upon private enforcement of the securities laws. Soon thereafter the horrors of the Great Depression returned and massive securities fraud triggered the Great Recession of 2008 as economists predicted. This Article argues for a rollback of the war on private securities litigation to at least the 1980 s based upon history and economic science. This would at least restore sensible pleading standards, impose liability on all participants in securities frauds (including <b>aiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>abettors)</b> <b>and</b> allow the states to impose more demanding standards of liability on wrongdoers in financial markets...|$|R

There are a number of circumstances in which the law imposes liability for torts committed by other persons. Liability is imposed on an <b>aider</b> <b>and</b> <b>abettor</b> who gives substantial assistance or encouragement to another person’s commission of a tort, provided the <b>aider</b> <b>and</b> <b>abettor</b> actually knows the other person’s conduct is tortious. Liability is also imposed on a party who induces another person to commit a tort if the inducer either knows or should know of circumstances that would make the conduct tortious. In addition, liability is imposed on a party who permits another person to commit torts on the party’s premises or with the party’s instrumentalities if the party knows the other person is acting or will act tortiously. The law of indirect infringement for patents, copyrights, and trademarks originally developed out of the general tort law, but it has diverged from the general tort law in various ways. Since direct infringement is a statutory tort, liability should not be imposed for indirect infringement when the general tort law would not impose liability for other types of torts committed by other persons, unless there are sound reasons for treating infringement differently than other types of torts. Consequently, the general tort law may provide insight as to how unsettled issues in the law of indirect infringement should be resolved. In addition, identifying differences between the general tort law principles and the law of indirect infringement reveals questionable case law that should be reexamined...|$|E
40|$|Global {{international}} terrorism depends on financial support by individual and corporate “sponsors” of such crimes. Consequently, a possible way to combat terrorism is to limit {{access to such}} funding. The financing of terrorism is a global phenomenon which requires a well-co-ordinated, multilateral response involving a variety of international stakeholders such as the United Nations Security Council, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) {{as well as individual}} states. This approach has to be holistic in its nature by combining criminal law enforcement measures with the use of civil litigation by individual victims of terrorism against terrorist groups and their sponsors. The role of corporations, such as banks (cf. the US Arab Bank cases) and other entities (cf. the Boim litigation cases), as well as individuals, as <b>aiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>abettors</b> of {{international terrorism}} is known (cf. UN Consolidated List established and maintained by the 1267 Committee with respect to Al-Qaida et al). This short article aims to introduce the reader to the evolving notion of corporate liability for acts of aiding and abetting of human rights violations and acts of terrorism before federal courts in the USA, which may serve as an additional legal option for the individual victim of terrorism to achieve some form of justice, reparation respectively...|$|R
40|$|The Fair Fund {{provision}} of Sarbanes-Oxley allows the SEC to distribute money penalties to injured investors, heralding a new compensatory {{role for the}} agency. The SEC has {{announced that it will}} direct money to injured investors whenever possible, but has not articulated clear priorities. This Article fills the gap by introducing terms of debate and proposing a framework for the SEC’s exercise of its discretion. The Article introduces the concept of “public class counsel,” a public actor that has the dual function of deterrence and victim compensation. The concept describes—and suggests limits to—the SEC’s role in a system in which public and private remedies for securities violations increasingly converge. The Article then draws on the analogy between the “public class counsel” and the “private attorney general” to propose an answer to the question: When should the SEC exercise its discretion to create a Fair Fund? This Article suggests that the SEC focus on distributing penalties gathered from <b>aiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>abettors</b> of securities fraud because such an approach would minimize two significant concerns with investor compensation: first, that compensation of injured investors often amounts to a transfer of money among equally innocent investors and, second, that giving the SEC and private actors a role in compensation risks duplication of costs...|$|R
60|$|Whereas {{there has}} been wickedly and traitorously printed and {{published}} {{this morning in the}} New York World and New York Journal of Commerce, newspapers printed and published in the city of New York, a false and spurious proclamation purporting to be signed by the President and to be countersigned by the Secretary of State, which publication is of a treasonable nature, designed to give aid and comfort to the enemies of the United States and to the rebels now at war against the Government <b>and</b> their <b>aiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>abettors,</b> you are therefore hereby commanded forthwith to arrest and imprison in any fort or military prison in your command, the editors, proprietors, and publishers of the aforesaid newspapers, and all such persons as, after public notice has been given of the falsehood of said publication, print and publish the same with intent to give aid and comfort to the enemy; and you will hold the persons so arrested in close custody until they can be brought to trial before a military commission for their offense. You will also take possession by military force of the printing establishments of the New York World and Journal of Commerce, and hold the same until further orders, and prohibit any further publication therefrom.|$|R
