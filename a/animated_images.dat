With indoor scenes, reflections or <b>animated</b> <b>images</b> on screens lead to background changes. Similarly, due to wind, rain or illumination changes brought by weather, static backgrounds methods have difficulties with outdoor scenes.|$|E

500|$|Lunar: The Silver Star is a traditional, {{top-down}} role-playing {{video game}} featuring two-dimensional characters and environments. The player must navigate towns, fields, and harsh environments to complete story-based objectives that move the plot forward, {{as well as}} interact with non-player characters to expand the script and gain various rewards. Making use of the Sega CD's disc hardware capabilities, short video and audio interludes accompany the game's narrative, including full or quarter-screen <b>animated</b> <b>images</b> and CD-DA sound files. [...] Players record their progress by saving to either the Sega CD's internal RAM, or a separately purchased RAM cartridge that fit into the accompanying Mega Drive/Genesis.|$|E
500|$|The film {{industry}} is a subject of satire as well. For example, Japanese censorship often involved masking prohibited sections of the screen. Here Suzuki preemptively masked his own compositions but animated them and incorporated them into the film's design. In the story, after Hanada finds {{he is unable to}} kill Misako he wanders the streets in a state of confusion. The screen is obscured by <b>animated</b> <b>images</b> with accompanying sounds associated to her. The effects contributed to the eclectic visual and sound design while signifying his obsessive love. Author Stephen Teo proposed that the antagonistic relationship between Hanada and Number One may have been analogous of Suzuki's relationship with studio president Kyūsaku Hori. He compared Hanada's antagonizers to those who had been pressuring Suzuki to rein in his style over the previous two years. Teo cited Number One's sleeping with his eyes open and urinating where he sits, which the character explains as techniques one must master to become a [...] "top professional." ...|$|E
2500|$|Social {{media has}} also {{facilitated}} {{the spread of}} blackface in culture. In 2016, a controversy emerged over Snapchat's Bob Marley filter, which allowed users to superimpose dark skin, dreadlocks, and a knitted cap over their own faces. A number of controversies have also emerged about students at American universities sharing images of themselves appearing to wear blackface makeup. Additionally, writer Victoria Princewill criticized non-black people sharing <b>animated</b> <b>images</b> of black people or black-skinned emojis, calling the practice [...] "digital blackface".|$|E

2500|$|Instead of a {{one-shot}} temporary installation, the hackers have {{designed and built}} a permanent facility that can be re-used repeatedly by the MIT community. An understanding has been reached with the EAPS Department, which is headquartered in the Green Building, to allow the light display hardware to remain installed in each window. [...] To avoid annoying the occupants and to allow late-working staff to [...] "opt out", each light display {{is equipped with a}} manual override button, which will disable the pixel lighting for that window for several hours after it is pressed. In addition, the hackers have released Open Source software tools used to develop new display patterns, so that others can design and deploy new stationary or <b>animated</b> <b>images,</b> in cooperation with the hacker engineers.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2017, JTC1/SC29/WG1 {{issued a}} Call for {{proposals}} on JPEG XL - {{the next generation}} of image compression standard with substantially better compression efficiency (60% improvement) comparing to JPEG. The standard is expected to follow performance by HEVC HM, Daala and WebP. The core requirements include support for <b>animated</b> <b>images,</b> [...] 8-10 bits per component, and alpha channel coding. [...] The standard should also offer high-quality compression of synthetic images, such as bitmap fonts and gradients, higher bit depths (12-16 bit and floating point) for improved dynamic range, wide color gamut using different color spaces (including Rec.2020/2100 and LogC), and lossless alpha channel encoding. Any patented technologies would be licensed on a royalty-free basis. The proposals should be submitted by April 2018, with current target publication date in early 2020.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2010, 33-year-old Idaho man Steven Kutzner {{entered into}} a plea {{agreement}} concerning images of child characters from the American animated television show The Simpsons engaged in sexual acts. The case was originally brought up {{due to the fact}} that the German Federal Police identified and reported to U.S. authorities Kutzner's IP address as one where a known file containing actual child pornography was being shared. During the forensic investigation, which uncovered [...] "six hundred and thirty two (632) image files, seventy (70) of which were <b>animated</b> <b>images</b> graphically depicting minors engaging in sex acts", [...] "five-hundred-and-twenty-four (524) pornographic image files, most of which depict what appears to be teenaged females", and [...] "more than eight-thousand files containing images child erotica involving younger children, many of them prepubescent", Kutzner admitted that he had knowingly received actual child pornography [...] "for at least eight years".|$|E
