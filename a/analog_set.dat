30|$|Through {{the choice}} of predicates: If {{identical}} predicates {{are used in the}} <b>analog</b> <b>sets,</b> and ACME ends up creating a node representing a mapping for these two predicates, this node is always given a little bit of extra positive activation, 0.1.|$|R

50|$|A digital {{transport}} adapter will allow viewing of basic channels, often {{as many as}} 99, but not premium channels. It will also not allow video on demand or pay-per-view.

3000|$|For each {{proposition}} {{which is}} a member of the corresponding equivalence classes from the two <b>analog</b> <b>sets,</b> make a “map node”, a network node which represents a possible mapping between those two propositions.

Example: These two propositions: [...]...|$|R
30|$|To model these ideas, {{given two}} <b>analog</b> <b>sets,</b> ACME generates all {{possible}} mappings between propositions, predicates, and arguments which preserve syntactic structure and argument types. (ACME has no built-in knowledge of any natural language.) Each possible mapping between two elements {{is represented by}} ACME as single node in the analogy network. Links between nodes represent positive and negative constraints. These are designed to enforce the rules of thumb given above as well as possible. The network settling process should then give high activations to nodes representing mappings which compose a good analogy, and low or negative activations to other nodes.|$|R

30|$|Figures 4 and 5 {{show that}} sky origin beliefs, {{initially}} with activations 0.0, immediately acquire positive activations, and stabilize at values near 1 by step 1000. The initial rise in these activations {{is due to}} the fact that their pattern of relationships parallels relationships between hunting propositions. POPCO constructs an analogy between hunting propositions and sky origin propositions and as a result, creates positively weighted links between those hunting propositions and sky origin propositions that play similar roles in the two <b>analog</b> <b>sets.</b> Then since hunting propositions have high positive activations, positive activation is transmitted to sky origin propositions.|$|R

5000|$|Within a {{distance}} of 35 to 40 miles from the broadcast stations, {{it is possible that}} no equipment more special than perhaps a simple antenna (such as [...] "rabbit ears") may be necessary to receive a DTV broadcast signal OTA—at least some of the time for some of the channels. Any television equipped with an ATSC tuner may display DTV broadcasts properly. Some customers are already discovering that terrain, trees, rain, snow, wind, and even the movement of people around the room interfere with reception to one degree or another, from signals breaking up to total loss of signal. (Few ATSC-equipped televisions or converter boxes have internal antennas, in contrast to <b>analog</b> <b>sets</b> available in years past).|$|R
