40|$|This {{evaluation}} of the assessment and rating process for early childhood education and care and school age care services had as its focus the validity and reliability of the process. In particular, do the items reviewed with the Assessment and Rating Instrument provide consistent and replicable measures? Would the judgements made <b>by</b> one <b>authorised</b> <b>officer</b> be made <b>by</b> other <b>authorised</b> <b>officers</b> reviewing the same service? Does the process—including use of the Instrument—allow distinctions between rating levels? The evaluation was undertaken by the Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER), which analysed assessment and rating data from both draft and final reports; managed the online surveys of services and authorised officers; conducted focus groups with services and authorised officers; and had discussions with regulatory authority staff. Focus group sessions were conducted in each capital city, with participants from outside the metropolitan area participating in person or by telephone...|$|R

40|$|This {{occasional}} paper {{is the third}} in a series on the National Quality Framework (NQF). The paper reports on activities to promote consistency and efficiency in the implementation and administration of the NQF, which are key functions of the Australian Children 2 ̆ 7 s Education and Care Quality Authority (ACECQA) under the Education and Care Services National Law (the National Law). Given the joint governance arrangements {{in place for the}} NQF, striving for consistency and efficiency is a collaborative effort between the eight state and territory regulatory authorities, the Australian Government and ACECQA. The paper highlights the breadth and depth of collaboration to identify, implement and review approaches to promote consistency and efficiency under the NQF. This is intended to offer visibility and assurance to external stakeholders of these collaborative strategies and activities, much of which occurs ‘behind the scenes’. In the context of the NQF, consistency is most importantly about the outcomes that result from the way the NQF is administered. The paper provides an overview of ACECQA’s approach to consistency, which is outlined in ACECQA’s National Consistency Strategy and Implementation Plan 2015 - 16. The plan, published in October 2015, is informed by the experiences of service providers and guided by the principles of best practice regulation. It identifies seven consistency related priorities: 	training and support for <b>authorised</b> <b>officers</b> employed <b>by</b> state and territory regulatory authorities to administer the NQF 	national audits of aspects of the NQF 	application and assessment functions 	sector and family communications 	analysis of assessment and rating data 	collaboration with state and territory regulatory authorities, and other partner organisations 	maintaining and enhancing the National Quality Agenda Information Technology 	System (NQA ITS), the national IT system used by state and territory regulatory 	authorities to administer the NQF...|$|R
