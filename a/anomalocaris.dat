5|$|In 1985 Derek Briggs and Whittington {{published}} {{a description of}} <b>Anomalocaris,</b> also from the Burgess Shale. Swedish palaeontologist Jan Bergström suggested that the two animals were related, as they shared lateral flaps with gills, stalked eyes and other features; and he classified them as primitive arthropods, although he considered that arthropods are not a single phylum.|$|E
5|$|Anomalocaridids, such as <b>Anomalocaris,</b> were {{organism}}s {{thought to}} be distantly related to the arthropods. These creatures looked quite unlike any organism living today—they had segmented exoskeletons, with lateral lobes used for swimming, typically large compound eyes, often set on stalks, and most strikingly, a pair of large, claw-like great appendages that resembled headless shrimp. These appendages {{are thought to have}} passed food to the animal's mouth, which resembled a ring of sliced pineapple.|$|E
5|$|The first Burgess Shale fossils {{were found}} on Mount Stephen in Canada's Rocky Mountains by a {{construction}} worker, whose reports of them reached Richard McConnell of the Geological Survey of Canada. McConnell found trilobite beds there in 1886, and some unusual fossils that he reported to his superior. These were misdiagnosed as headless shrimps with unjointed appendages, and were named <b>Anomalocaris</b> because of their unusual appendages– but {{turned out to be}} pieces of a puzzle that took 90years to solve.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} {{thorough}} examination of Opabinia in 1975 revealed its unusual features, {{it was thought}} to be unrelated to any known phylum, although possibly related to a hypothetical ancestor of arthropods and of annelid worms. However other finds, most notably <b>Anomalocaris,</b> suggested that it belonged to a group of animals that were closely related to the ancestors of arthropods and of which the living animals onychophorans and tardigrades may also be members.|$|E
5|$|However, other discoveries and {{analyses}} soon followed, revealing similar-looking {{animals such as}} <b>Anomalocaris</b> from the Burgess Shale and Kerygmachela from Sirius Passet. Another Burgess Shale animal, Aysheaia, was considered very similar to modern Onychophora, which are regarded as close relatives of arthropods. Paleontologists defined a group called lobopods to include animals that {{are thought to be}} close relatives of arthropods but lack jointed limbs. There is still debate about whether lobopods are monophyletic, i.e. whether they include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, and about whether arthropods are a sub-group of lobopods or a sister-group.|$|E
25|$|The {{rate of the}} {{evolution}} of life as recorded by fossils accelerated in the Cambrian period (542–488Ma). The sudden emergence of many new species, phyla, and forms in this period is called the Cambrian Explosion. The biological fomenting in the Cambrian Explosion was unpreceded before and since that time. Whereas the Ediacaran life forms appear yet primitive and not easy to put in any modern group, {{at the end of the}} Cambrian most modern phyla were already present. The development of hard body parts such as shells, skeletons or exoskeletons in animals like molluscs, echinoderms, crinoids and arthropods (a well-known group of arthropods from the lower Paleozoic are the trilobites) made the preservation and fossilization of such life forms easier than those of their Proterozoic ancestors. For this reason, much more is known about life in and after the Cambrian than about that of older periods. Some of these Cambrian groups appear complex but are quite different from modern life; examples are <b>Anomalocaris</b> and Haikouichthys.|$|E
25|$|After Raymond's few excursions, the Burgess Shale faded {{somewhat}} into obscurity. Walcott's third wife, Mary Vaux, discouraged {{access to}} the collections, which gathered dust on high shelves in the Smithsonian Institution. Harry Whittington, then of Harvard University, was to prove the catalyst that renewed interest in the site. As he showed a visiting trilobite expert around Raymond's collections, {{the necessity of a}} restudy was pointed out to Whittington, who proceeded to lobby the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) to revisit the locality. They did, and as a leading authority on trilobites, Whittington was the logical choice to head the palaeontological investigations in the arthropod-rich Shale. In the company of Jim Aitken and Bill Fritz, he led a GSC reconnaissance expedition in 1966; fellow trilobitologist David Bruton joined the crew the next year as they went out to quarry in force. Dynamite was used in only the smallest quantities, with closely spaced drill holes used to separate large blocks of rock, and large slabs were collected systematically from the Walcott and Raymond quarries. These were labelled with their stratigraphic level, helicoptered from the mountain face, and returned to Whittington's base at the Sedgwick Museum in Cambridge for further study. The 1967 operation resulted in the description of new animals, including the earliest known crinoid and a complete <b>Anomalocaris.</b> Initially, detailed descriptions were made {{of some of the most}} common arthropod-like organisms: Marrella, Sidneyia and Burgessia. These redescriptions were slow and laborious, making extensive use of the camera lucida technique for microscope drawing, with papers based extensively around detailed drawing of the fossil specimens. It soon became clear that the Burgess Shale was even more exceptional than previously thought - soft tissue was preserved to an exquisite quality, allowing insights into early life that had never before been dreamed of, and preserving a range of non-mineralising taxa which are otherwise invisible in the fossil record. With an overwhelmingly diverse fauna in need of cataloguing, Harry Whittington set his two new graduate students to the task, assigning Derek Briggs and Simon Conway Morris the arthropods and 'worms', respectively. This work began to lift the veil on an unexpectedly diverse ecosystem, with almost as much variety as seen in the modern oceans - the old theory that Cambrian life was simple, straightforwards and slightly dull disintegrated further with each new fossil described. This view was reinforced with the identification of other Burgess Shale-type deposits elsewhere in the world, a search for which was triggered by the discovery of the Chengjiang and Sirius Passet lagerstätten in 1984.|$|E

500|$|The {{discovery}} of <b>Anomalocaris</b> ("abnormal shrimp") was a comedy of errors. The name was initially {{given to a}} fossil that looked like the rear end of a shrimp-like crustacean. Walcott classified a ring-like fossil he called Peytoia {{as a kind of}} jellyfish, and another poorly preserved fossil he called Laggania as a holothurian (sea cucumber). After many plot twists, Derek Briggs started dissecting another ill-defined fossil in very thin slices and found a pair of Anomalocaris-like structures on one end of a specimen of Laggania, which also had a specimen of Peytoia attached just behind those of <b>Anomalocaris.</b> After dissecting more specimens and finding similar configurations, Briggs and Whittington concluded that the whole assemblage represented a single animal, which was named <b>Anomalocaris</b> because that was the earliest name assigned to any of its parts. This animal's body was fragile and usually disintegrated before it could be fossilized. But the complete animal had tough grasping appendages (<b>Anomalocaris),</b> a tough, ring-like mouth with teeth on the inner edge (Peytoia) and a long, segmented body (Laggania) with flaps on the sides that enabled it to swim with a Mexican wave motion, and perhaps to turn quickly by putting the flaps on one side into reverse. This monster was over [...] long when other animals were only a few inches at most. Nedin suggested in 1999 that the animal was capable of taking heavily armored trilobites apart, possibly by grabbing one end of their prey in their jaws while using their appendages to quickly rock {{the other end of the}} animal back and forth, causing the prey's exoskeleton to rupture and allowing the predator to access its innards. In 2009 Hagadorn found that anomalocarid mouthparts showed little wear, which suggests they did not come into regular contact with mineralised trilobite shells. Computer modeling of the <b>Anomalocaris</b> mouthparts suggests they were in fact better suited to sucking on smaller, soft-bodied organisms. Although Whittington and Briggs concluded that <b>Anomalocaris</b> did not fit into any known phylum, research since the 1990s has concluded that it was closely related to Opabinia and to the ancestors of arthropods. In 2009 a fossil named Schinderhannes bartelsi, an apparent relative of <b>Anomalocaris,</b> was found in the Early Devonian period, about 100million years later than the Burgess Shale.|$|E
500|$|The {{organism}} {{has also}} prompted novel hypotheses about {{the classification of}} early arthropods. [...] One classification scheme has Schinderhannes classified basally to the crown arthropods, but closer to that group than <b>Anomalocaris.</b> [...] This {{would mean that the}} crown arthropod lineage evolved from a paraphyletic grade of anomalocaridids, and that the group of early arthropods with short 'great appendages' are not a natural grouping. [...] The biramous limb of arthropods may then have arisen through fusion of anomalocaridid lateral lobes and gills.|$|E
500|$|Reasonably {{complete}} fossils {{are very}} rare, most extinct organisms are represented only by partial fossils, and complete fossils are rarest in the oldest rocks. So paleontologists have mistakenly assigned {{parts of the}} same organism to different genera, which were often defined solely to accommodate these finds– the story of <b>Anomalocaris</b> {{is an example of}} this. The risk of this mistake is higher for older fossils because these are often unlike parts of any living organism. Many [...] "superfluous" [...] genera are represented by fragments that are not found again, and these [...] "superfluous" [...] genera appear to become extinct very quickly.|$|E
500|$|While this {{discussion}} about specific fossils such as Opabinia and <b>Anomalocaris</b> was going on, {{the concept of}} stem groups was introduced to cover evolutionary [...] "aunts" [...] and [...] "cousins". A crown group {{is a group of}} closely related living animals plus their last common ancestor plus all its descendants. A stem group contains offshoots from members of the lineage earlier than the last common ancestor of the crown group; it is a relative concept, for example tardigrades are living animals that form a crown group in their own right, but Budd (1996) regarded them also as being a stem group relative to the arthropods. Viewing strange-looking organisms like Opabinia in this way makes it possible to see that, while the Cambrian explosion was unusual, it can be understood in terms of normal evolutionary processes.|$|E
500|$|Conway Morris gave Hallucigenia {{its name}} because in his {{reconstruction}} it looked bizarre – a worm-like animal that walked on long, rigid spines {{and had a}} row of tentacles along its back. Science fiction author Greg Bear says the Jarts in his The Way stories were scaled-up versions of this reconstruction. However, in the late 1980s Lars Ramsköld literally turned it over, so that the tentacles, which he found were paired, became legs and the spines were defensive equipment on its back. Ramsköld classified {{it as one of}} the Onychophora, a phylum of [...] "worms with legs" [...] that is considered closely related to arthropods. Another current view is that Hallucigenia was an armored lobopod, in other words more closely related to arthropods than the onychophorans are, but less closely related to arthropods than Opabinia or <b>Anomalocaris</b> are.|$|E
2500|$|The {{richness}} of fossils in the Field area was first identified by workers {{associated with the}} construction of the Trans-Canada railway, which had (somewhat controversially) been routed through the Kicking Horse valley. Richard McConnell, of the Geological Survey of Canada, was mapping the geology around the railway line in September 1886, and was pointed to the Mount Stephen trilobite beds by a construction worker. [...] Several unusual fossils were subsequently described from this site, including sponges, worms, and the appendages of the unusual <b>Anomalocaris,</b> identified at that time as the bodies of crabs. Some of these fossils found their way to Charles Doolittle Walcott, who described them and correctly estimated their Middle Cambrian age. These fossils whetted Walcott's appetite for the region, {{but it was not until}} 1907 that the opportunity arose for him to visit Mount Stephen in person.|$|E
50|$|In 1985, Harry B. Whittington and Derek E. G. Briggs {{described}} the first full-body specimens of Peytoia nathorsti {{along with the}} first full-body specimen of <b>Anomalocaris</b> canadensis. Based on the newly apparent similarities between the two species, they considered P. nathorsti to be a species of <b>Anomalocaris,</b> as <b>Anomalocaris</b> nathorsti.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{species of}} <b>Anomalocaris</b> likely preyed on soft-bodied animals. Recent phylogenetic {{analyses}} {{have also found}} [...] "A." [...] briggsi {{to be closer to}} the filter-feeding anomalocaridids (including Tamisiocaris) than <b>Anomalocaris,</b> which suggests that [...] "A." [...] briggsi is likely not a species of <b>Anomalocaris</b> and may have been a filter-feeder as well.|$|E

5000|$|A long-standing view {{holds that}} <b>Anomalocaris</b> fed on hard-bodied animals, {{including}} trilobites; while its mid-gut glands strongly suggest a predatory lifestyle, {{its ability to}} penetrate mineralised shells has, however, been questioned in recent years. Some Cambrian trilobites have been found with round or W-shaped [...] "bite" [...] marks, which were identified as being the same shape as the mouthparts of <b>Anomalocaris.</b> Stronger evidence that <b>Anomalocaris</b> ate trilobites comes from fossilised faecal pellets, which contain trilobite parts and are so large that the anomalocarids are the only known organism from that period large enough to have produced them. However, since <b>Anomalocaris</b> lacks any mineralised tissue, it seemed unlikely {{that it would be}} able to penetrate the hard, calcified shell of trilobites. Rather, the coprolites may have been produced by a different organism, such as a trilobite of the genus Redlichia.|$|E

50|$|Compared with <b>Anomalocaris</b> species, Peytoia species lacked tail {{structures}} {{and had a}} considerably larger head with the eyes placed behind instead of {{in front of the}} mouth, which would have been disadvantagous for active hunting.
