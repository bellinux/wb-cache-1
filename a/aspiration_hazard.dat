5000|$|<b>Aspiration</b> <b>hazard</b> {{includes}} severe acute effects such as chemical pneumonia, {{varying degrees}} of pulmonary injury or death following aspiration. Aspiration is the entry of a liquid or solid directly through the oral or nasal cavity, or indirectly from vomiting, into the trachea and lower respiratory system. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are {{assigned to one of}} two hazard categories this hazard class on the basis of viscosity.|$|E
50|$|There {{is a risk}} of {{aspiration}} of vomit {{trapped in}} the helmet air passages, with possibly fatal consequences. This problem is greatest in helmets and full-face masks with internal oro-nasal masks, where it will pass into the demand valve, and that which does not exit through the exhaust ports, will be an <b>aspiration</b> <b>hazard</b> unless flushed out before the next inhalation. A different problem occurs in free-flow helmets - there is less chance of aspiration, but vomit remains in the helmet or drains through into the diving suit, which is unpleasant, but not life-threatening. It {{may be possible to}} flush it out through the neck seal.|$|E
50|$|White {{spirit is}} mainly classed as an irritant. It has a fairly low acute {{toxicity}} by inhalation of the vapour, dermal (touching the skin) and oral routes (ingestion). However, acute exposure {{can lead to}} central nervous system depression resulting in lack of coordination and slowed reactions. Exposure to very high concentrations in enclosed spaces can lead to general narcotic effects (drowsiness, dizziness, nausea etc...) and can eventually lead to unconsciousness. Oral ingestion presents a high <b>aspiration</b> <b>hazard.</b> Prolonged or repeated skin exposure {{over a long period}} of time can result in severe irritant dermatitis, also called contact dermatitis. Exposure to white spirit in direct contact with the skin for several hours can cause severe chemical burns.It is recommended that skin exposure be kept to a minimum by use of gloves, and that hands be washed after contact. Occasional exposure to skin is highly unlikely to cause any problems.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Aspiration</b> <b>hazards</b> are solids or liquids {{which can}} cause damage through inhalation.|$|R
40|$|Petroleum-derived {{substances}} {{are complex}} and composed of aliphatic (normal-, iso-, and cycloparaffins), olefinic, and/or aromatic constituents. Approximately 400 of these complex substances were evaluated {{as part of the}} US Environmental Protection Agency voluntary High Production Volume (HPV) Challenge program. The substances were separated into 13 groups (categories), and all available data were assessed. Toxicology testing was conducted as necessary to fully address the end points encompassed by the HPV initiative. In a broad sense, volatile hydrocarbons may cause acute central nervous system effects, and those that are liquids at room temperature pose <b>aspiration</b> <b>hazards</b> if taken into the lungs as liquids and may also cause skin irritation. Higher boiling substances may contain polycyclic aromatic constituents (PACs) that can be mutagenic and carcinogenic and may also cause developmental effects. Substances containing PACs can also cause target organ and developmental effects. The effects of aliphatic constituents include liver enlargement and/or renal effects in male rats via an a- 2 u-globulin-mediated process and, in some cases, small but statistically significant reductions in hematological parameters. Crude oils may contain other constituents, particularly sulfur- and nitrogen-containing compounds, which are removed during refining. Aside from these more generic considerations, some specific petroleum substances may contain unusually toxic constituents including benzene, 1, 3 -butadiene, and/or n-hexane, which should also be taken into account if present at toxicologically relevant levels...|$|R
40|$|Thyroid {{cancer is}} the most common {{endocrine}} gland malignancy and fine-needle aspiration biopsy is widely used for thyroid nodule evaluation. Repeated aspiration biopsies are needed due to plausible false-negative results. This study aimed to investigate the overall relationship between aspiration biopsy and thyroid cancer diagnosis, and to explore factors related to shorter diagnostic time. This nationwide retrospective cohort study retrieved data from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database in Taiwan. Subjects without known thyroid malignancies and who received the first thyroid aspiration biopsy after 2004 were followed-up from 2004 to 2009 (n = 7700). Chi-square test, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and Cox proportional hazards model were used for data analysis. Of 7700 newly-aspirated patients, 276 eventually developed thyroid cancer (malignancy rate 3. 6 %). Among the 276 patients with thyroid cancer, 61. 6 % underwent only one aspiration biopsy and 81. 2 % were found within the first year after the initial <b>aspiration.</b> Cox proportional <b>hazards</b> model revealed that aspiration frequency (HR 1. 07, 95 % CI 1. 06 - 1. 08), ultrasound frequency (HR 1. 02, 95 % CI 1. 01 - 1. 03), older age, male sex, and aspiration biopsies arranged by surgery, endocrinology or otolaryngology subspecialties were all associated with shorter time to thyroid cancer diagnosis. About 17. 4 % of thyroid cancer cases received more than two aspiration biopsies and 18. 8 % were diagnosed one year after the first biopsy. Regular follow-up with repeated aspiration or ultrasound may be required for patients with clinically significant thyroid nodules...|$|R
40|$|Main Hazard : Harmful if {{swallowed}} or inhaled. Possible <b>aspiration</b> <b>hazard</b> if swallowed (can enter {{lungs and}} cause damage). May be irritating to the skin, eyes and respiratory tract. Over exposure may cause CNS depression. Possible reproductive hazard. Flammability: Flash Point 12 :C. Extremely flammable liquid (R 11). Ignition temperature 425 :C. Chemical Hazard : Ethanol is a flammable liquid whose vapours can form ignitable and explosive mixtures with air at normal room temperatures. Thus, an aqueous mixture containing 30 % ethanol {{can produce a}} flammable mixture of vapour and air at 29 :C, and even one containing only 5 % alcohol can produce a flammable mixture at 62 :C...|$|E
40|$|In laryngectomized {{patients}} a tracheo-esophageal artificial fistula {{can be used}} to achieve air flow from the trachea to the esophagus during speech. A one-way plastic valve is often used for the fistula. A free jejunal graft between the trachea and the esophagus can also be used. To avoid aspiration the transplant is attached to the submental area giving the graft a siphon-like shape. We performed 23 videoradiographic examinations using high-density barium in 14 such patients. The aim was to evaluate the protective function of these grafts against aspiration. Penetration of the bolus and a small amount of residual contrast material in the ascending limb of the graft was a normal finding. If the standard barium bolus reached the descending limb {{at any time during the}} examination, this was a sign of <b>aspiration</b> <b>hazard.</b> To avoid aspiration, the vertex of the speech siphon should be higher than the level of the hypopharyngeal anastomosis...|$|E
