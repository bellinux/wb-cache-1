I don’t know much about what’s happening with that. Honestly, I don’t know what the studio wants to do next. I presume there will be some future projects for me to work on. I love doing that, I really do.

500|$|In his concert {{review for}} The Village Voice, Don Heckman {{described}} [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] as [...] "a song which expresses {{far better than}} words {{what kind of man}} Harrison is". Heckman went on to compare Harrison's philanthropy with the activities of two of his former bandmates, saying: [...] "I have no quarrel with John Lennon's endless clattering around inside his psyche, or Paul McCartney's search for sweetness and light, but <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> have to have stronger feelings about George Harrison's active efforts {{to do something about the}} misery in the world around him. How surprising that the most introspective of the Beatles should be the one who, in the long run, takes the most effective actions." ...|$|E

Coming so quickly after my decision to stay on the radio, this was quite an irony. I was given one day of training... from one minute to zero, at which point you have to say goodbye. I did not find that easy at all... I made a real hash of it after one of the early games..... very kindly, suggested a plan... as soon as the count started in our earpieces I would ask him a question, and he would talk until the count reached eight seconds to go. I would then thank him, turn to the camera and tell the audience briefly about the next game to be televised.

500|$|During the 2008 United States presidential election, Eastwood {{stated that}} he would be voting for John McCain, citing {{the fact that he had}} known McCain since he {{returned}} to the US in 1973 as a recently released POW. Eastwood said of McCain: [...] "I met him years ago when he first came back from Vietnam. This was back when (Ronald) Reagan was the governor of California and he had a big function for all of the prisoners of war who were released. I thought he was a terrific guy, a real American hero." [...] Nevertheless, Eastwood wished Barack Obama well upon his subsequent victory saying, [...] "Obama is my president now and I am going to be wishing him the very best because it is what is best for all of us." [...] Eastwood stated in 2010 of President Obama: [...] "I think he's a nice fella and I enjoyed watching him come along and I enjoyed watching him campaign and win the job. But I'm not a fan of what he's doing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment....</b> <b>I</b> just don't think he's governing. I don't think he's surrounded himself with the people he could have surrounded himself with." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{couple were}} {{at the center of}} a Red Button {{spin-off}} episode, featuring how Poppy and Fatboy spent their Christmas together. The spinoff, entitled [...] "All I Want for Christmas", featured the characters of Alice, Tyler (Discipline) and Tamwar (Patel), with Wood-Davis reprising her role as Tansy, whilst Keith Parry guest starred as [...] "Santa Tramp". Bright said of the spinoff, [...] "Poppy spends the day with Fatboy. She is under pressure to go back to her family, but realises she doesn't want that. Her and Fatboy have a romantic day, but you don't see anything on screen [...] because it is dominated by the Brannings. There will be an interactive section where viewers can press the red button and see a ten-minute film of how Poppy and Fatboy spent their day". Bright discussed their relationship in an interview with TV Guide, calling them the [...] "jolliest couple in Walford". She said, [...] "It's all very sweet for them both <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment.</b> <b>I</b> reckon they're going to be one of those couples who you want to shout 'Get a room!' at. They're characters who need to be loved. Poppy certainly hopes she's found her Prince Charming".|$|E
500|$|Aware of the {{potential}} for controversy, Liszt wrote, [...] "The barometer is hardly set on praise for me <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment.</b> <b>I</b> expect quite a hard downpour of rain when the symphonic poems appear." [...] Joseph Joachim, who in his time in Weimar had found Liszt's workshop rehearsals and the trial-and-error process practiced in them to be wearisome, was dismayed at what he considered their lack of creativity. Vienna music critic Eduard Hanslick found even the term [...] "Sinfonische Dichtung" [...] contradictory and offensive; he wrote against them with vehemence after he had heard only one, Les préludes. Surgeon Theodor Billroth, who was also a musical friend of Brahms, wrote of them, [...] "This morning [...] and Kirchner played the Symphonic Poems (sic) of Liszt on two pianos ... music of hell, and can't even be called musictoilet paper music! I finally vetoed Liszt on medical grounds and we purged ourselves with Brahms's [...] G Major String Sextet." [...] Wagner was more receptive; he agreed with the idea of the unity of the arts that Liszt espoused and wrote as much in his [...] "Open Letter on Liszt's Symphonic Poems". Walker considers this letter seminal in the War of the Romantics: ...|$|E

500|$|Comparing Jack's {{relationship}} with Ianto to his romantic tension with Gwen, David-Lloyd states [...] "I think [...] different sorts of love or lust, {{as it might}} be, and I think that's an ongoing thing ... <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>I</b> think there's two different sorts of love going on there." [...] He also states that he feels that Ianto's {{relationship with}} Jack is his first same-sex relationship, and doesn't feel that Ianto would be a [...] "labelist", but were he, he would identify as bisexual, but that he [...] "wouldn't regard himself {{the same way as}} Jack does because they're from different times." [...] Author Stephen James Walker feels sorry for Ianto, perceiving his relationship with Jack as a one-sided one. To him, Ianto views the relationship as [...] "serious and committed", as seen in [...] "A Day in the Death" [...] where he tells Owen that it is not just about sex. However, from dialogue in [...] "Something Borrowed", Walker believes that Jack appears to equate his relationship with Ianto to nothing more than a [...] "recreational activity". Walker also notes how important it was for Ianto when he cut in to dance with Jack, as {{this is the first time}} that his relationship with Jack is presented before the rest of the crew. The novel The House that Jack Built includes a scene where Gwen tries to clarify whether Ianto understands the nature of his relationship with Jack, saying [...] "You do know he's ...", which Ianto finishes [...] "Just a shag?" [...] before adding [...] "Yes I know. I can't help it, though. I've never been much good at casual." [...] In radio play [...] "The Dead Line", set just prior to series three, Ianto expounds his insecurities to Jack, who refutes them, confirming that his feelings for Ianto are real. When asked if the relationship will continue in series three, executive producer Julie Gardner replied, [...] "Yes, I like seeing them as a couple", while director Euros Lyn stated that [...] "the love story between Captain Jack and Ianto [...] to unfold" [...] in the third series. While Gareth David-Lloyd feels that the love story between Jack and Ianto was not fully resolved, which is [...] "part of the tragedy", the character and his relationship with Jack had been sufficiently explored in the third series for David-Lloyd to be [...] "happy to walk away from it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 2009, Käßmann {{expressed}} {{the opinion that}} it might be better to tear down former and unused churches than to allow them to be used for purposes that could damage their image. As examples of such purposes, she mentioned conversion into restaurants, discothèques, or mosques. A reassignment to a synagogue, however, she found positive. After protests from Muslims, she slightly qualified her statement, saying: [...] "If a Christian congregation is convinced that the use as a mosque can happen in deepest peace, I concur, but <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> do not see that possibility." ...|$|E

Shortly after accepting the post, Younis was quoted as saying, [...] "I will try and fix things that aren't right <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment...</b> <b>I</b> want our team to be consistent above all, in everything we do and that will require everyone to put their hands up."

2500|$|At {{the end of}} March 2014, U.S. {{president}} Obama {{ruled out}} any Western military intervention in Ukraine and admitted that Russia's annexation of Crimea {{would be hard to}} reverse; however, he dismissed Russia as a [...] "regional power" [...] that did not pose a major security threat to the U.S. In January 2016, when asked for his opinion of Obama's statement, Putin said, [...] "I think that speculations about other countries, an attempt to speak disrespectfully about other countries is an attempt to prove one's exceptionalism by contrast. In my view, that is a misguided position." [...] In November 2016, the president of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker said this of the statement of Obama: [...] "We have a lot to learn about the depths of Russia, we are very ignorant about it <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment.</b> <b>I</b> would like to have discussions on a level footing with Russia. Russia is not, as President Obama said, 'a regional power'. This was a big error in assessment." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1987 Powell joined {{other music}} greats for a jazz festival on the cruise ship SS Norway, playing {{alongside}} Benny Carter, Howard Alden, Milt Hinton, and Louie Bellson and others. One performance {{has been documented}} on the CD The Return of Mel Powell (Chiaroscuro Records). The recording includes 20 minutes of Powell discussing {{his life and his}} reasons for leaving jazz. In an interview with The New Yorker magazine jazz critic Whitney Balliett, Powell said: [...] "I have decided that when I retire I will think through my decision to leave jazz – with the help of Freud and Jung. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>I</b> suspect it was this: I had done what I felt I had to do in jazz. I had decided it did not hold the deepest interest for me musically. And I had decided that it was a young man's music, even a black music. Also, the endless repetition of material in the Goodman band – playing the same tunes day after day and night after night – got to me. That repetition tended to kill spontaneity, which is the heart of jazz and which can give a lifetime's nourishment." ...|$|E

Executive producer Diederick Santer said, [...] "I couldn't be more pleased that Charlie Brooks is re-joining EastEnders. With her appearances last month, she reminded us what a fine actress she is, and what an intriguing, watchable and engaging character she plays as Janine".

Pacquiao defeated Hatton {{in the second round}} by a KO victory after knocking Hatton down twice in the first round. Following the loss to Pacquiao, Hatton put his career on hiatus. After more than a year out of action, in a June 2010 interview with Gulfnews.com, the British boxer seemed uninterested in coming to the ring again. He stated: [...] "Boxing started off as a habit and it ended up giving me some money and making me {{a little bit of a}} better person. But I don't think I will have a fight again.

2500|$|Leatherface was {{originally}} slated for a 2016 release, {{which it did}} not meet. Despite having reached completion, it was temporarily shelved by Lionsgate Films. Sherwood speculated that the studio might have been afraid that they wouldn't make back their investment after another film underperformed, but {{admitted that he had}} no concrete explanation for the delay: [...] "In a strange way, I started to romanticize the idea it became some legendary lost film. It would be coveted – something spoken about, something people would try to contrive some way of seeing, something that would show up on a tired unused media at a convention in 50 years." [...] A film titled Leatherface received a direct-to-video release from Lightning Pictures in the United Kingdom in January 2017, featuring a masked chainsaw-brandishing figure on the home video cover. However, this film was not the Texas Chain Saw Massacre prequel, but rather a re-packaging of the unrelated Playing With Dolls: Bloodlust. The release was criticised by members of the press for its misleading marketing, with William Bibbiani scrutising on Blumhouse.com that [...] "It's not uncommon for horror movies to pick up new titles in domestic or foreign markets in an attempt to capitalize on various trends, but this is a particularly egregious example. It goes beyond mockbusters, which try to trick you into thinking it's the real deal, and simply takes the title of an upcoming, anticipated horror movie and tries to pass itself off as that movie." [...] Playing With Dolls director Rene Perez apologised for the title change, [...] "I am [...] to this title change but I am powerless to stop it. The sales agency didn't even inform me that a sale was made to the UK. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> am making a 3rd Playing with Dolls movie.
