2500|$|As {{in other}} {{mercenary}} armies {{of the day}} the raising of new troops was usually contracted out to military entrepreneurs. The States-General usually concluded a so-called Capitulatie with such a businessman, setting out the details, like the number of troops to be raised, the pay rates to be offered, the muster place, and the so-called Artikelbrief (the Articles of War governing the conduct of the troops). The entrepreneur usually took a commission himself as Colonel of the [...] "regiment" [...] to be raised (although the term [...] "regiment is used loosely here, as it did not yet connote a military formation of a fixed size). Subsequently the colonel sent out recruiters to the areas where the recruiting was to take place. These advertised the opportunity to enroll by having drummers attract attention in public places. The recruiters then signed up the new recruits (sometimes offering a signing bonus, though this was risky, because many who received this absconded before entering service). The recruits were then marched off to the <b>agreed</b> <b>place</b> of first muster. During this transport they were housed and fed for the account of the company captains, who received a fixed loopgeld (literally: [...] "marching money") for the infantry or the equivalent Anrittgelt for the cavalry.|$|E
2500|$|On March 29, the Empress Marie-Louise and her son, {{escorted by}} 1200 {{soldiers}} of the Old Guard, left Paris, heading for the Chateau of Blois in the Loire Valley. On March 30, a combined Russian, Austrian and Prussian army with 57,000 soldiers under Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, attacked Paris, which were defended by Marshal Auguste de Marmont and Marshal Édouard Mortier, duc de Trévise, with forty-one thousand men. Schwarzenberg {{sent a message to}} the French commanders, threatening to destroy the city if they did not surrender. After a day of bitter but indecisive fighting in Montmartre, Belleville, at the barriers of Clichy and Patin and the quarries of the Buttes de Chaumont, with about seven thousand soldiers killed on each side, Mortier marched his remaining troops southwest out of the city, while Marmont, with eleven thousand men, entered into secret negotiations with Allies. At two o'clock in the morning on 31 March, Marmont marched his soldiers to an <b>agreed</b> <b>place,</b> was surrounded Allied soldiers, and surrendered his forces and the city. Napoleon heard the news when he was at Juvisy, just fourteen miles from the city; he went immediately to Fontainebleau, where he arrived at 6:00a.m. on the 31st, and abdicated the throne on April 4.|$|E
60|$|After some difficulty, Ralph got a bed; {{and was at}} the <b>agreed</b> <b>place</b> at the {{appointed}} time.

The old man handed Ralph his whip, and returned him the fur coat; which Ralph was glad enough to put on, for the morning was bitterly cold, and Ralph--enfeebled by his illness--felt it keenly. In another five minutes, the carts were in motion across the bridge, and then away due south.|$|E

5000|$|As {{with all}} other Nantlle Railway {{passenger}} stopping places, the Carnarvon Castle terminus had no platforms, passengers boarded from and alighted to the trackside.

From these incidental activities an organization in the form of a club was established. Originally it was known as Athlone Yacht Club and was renamed Lough Ree Yacht Club in 1895, probably because by this time most its members sailed out of a small, sheltered bay at Ballyglass, on Lough Ree itself; Ballyglass is recorded as the venue of the Annual Regatta as early as 1836.|$|E

He planned a break-out, hoping to surprise the British and win against them in hand-to-hand combat, but the commander-in-chief, Patrick Pearse decided {{that the risk of}} civilian casualties was too high, and instead surrendered. McLoughlin opposed this decision, but nonetheless arranged for the remaining troops to march to the <b>agreed</b> <b>place</b> of surrender in an orderly fashion.|$|E
5000|$|When Charles Darwin first {{collected}} the species in 1835, {{he thought it}} was a finch.

50|$|Things {{get more}} {{complicated}} when an old mystery is remembered, involving a local widow named Mattie Darrow (Sissy Spacek), who was Bush's girlfriend in their youth, and her deceased sister, Mary Lee Stroup (Arin Logan). With {{the help of}} a preacher who insists on Bush telling Mattie the truth, Bush tells those gathered at his funeral party (including Mattie) what happened forty years earlier. He reveals his affair with Mattie's married sister, Mary Lee. He confesses to Mattie that it was Mary Lee who was his true love, his only love. They made plans to run away together, and when she didn't arrive at the <b>agreed</b> <b>place,</b> he went to her home to search for her. He discovered that her husband had attacked her with a hammer, knocking her out. The husband threw a kerosene lamp against a wall to set the house on fire and kill himself, the unconscious Mary Lee, and Bush. Bush freed himself from the attacking husband, but as his clothes caught fire, he also saw Mary Lee catch fire. As he went to put the fire out, he felt himself flying through the window, possibly pushed by the husband, and he was unable to re-enter the house to save Mary Lee.|$|E

Unfortunately it is not all of companies conduct exact performance such has been agreed as initially. It is like in the conduction of showcase or gondola rental agreement between Citrouli Swalayan 24 Hours. In this agreement some bad-performance conducted likes the gondola which is purposed merely for Ultra Milk’s product, however there are other products located in the gondola, the positioning of gondola which should be positioned in entrance door, they are positioned beside the cashier. The purpose of this legal research was to find out the causes of bad-performance in Citrouli Swalayan 24 Hours towards the rental agreement of Citrouli Swalayan 24 Hours and PT Ultra Jaya is not appropriate to the agreement and stipulation of regulations. The type of this research was empirical legal research. The method of analysis used was qualitative research, i. e. finding out data which was appropriate to the studied object by literary and interview which directly conducted towards respondents, i. e. the employees of Citrouli Swalayan 24 Hours and supplier of PT Ultra Jaya. The result of this research found that PT Ultra Jaya remedy’s in order to solve the bad-performence by Citrouli Swalayan 24 Hours are confirmation and negotiation. Consideration of these steps are triggering factor of bad-performance are the consument who put the Ultra Milk’s product to other gondola, the lack of human resources as employee in Citrouli Swalayan 24 Hours building after the agreement established make the gondola is impossible to positioned in the <b>agreed</b> <b>place...</b>|$|E
