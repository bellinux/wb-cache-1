5|$|After a {{recommendation}} from high-ranking Dutch naval officers that the Koninklijke Marine (Royal Netherlands Navy) be bolstered so any attacker {{would have to}} deploy {{a significant amount of}} their fleet to the East Indies, keeping it from other theaters of war, the Minister of Defense ordered the Navy to prepare designs for <b>a</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three-member class of battlecruisers. As they had not previously designed a modern capitalship, and the only information available on modern designs came from public literature and editions of Jane's Fighting Ships, the Dutch turned to Germany. This initially bore no results, as the two sides were unable to come to terms. During this time, a preliminary plan was drawn up without foreign assistance; completed on 11 July 1939, it was missing many of the post-First World War advances in warship technology. In particular, the armor protection was completely outmoded.|$|E

25|$|A {{programme}} of road improvements, {{starting in}} the 1920s, transformed the road, {{so that it is}} now predominantly <b>a</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three lane carriageway, bypassing the town centres; south of the South Downs National Park, it includes a section of motorway, the A3(M), just before the road reaches the A27 at Havant. The construction of the Kingston and Guildford bypasses in the 1920s and 1930s made use of temporary narrow gauge railways to move the construction materials. The Esher bypass, between Hook from the first mentioned bypass to the M25, is three lanes with a motorway-standard hard shoulder; from there to Guildford the road has three lanes.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} motorized bicycles were ordinary utility bicycles {{fitted with}} an add-on motor and transmission to assist normal pedal propulsion, {{and it is}} this form that principally distinguishes the motorized bicycle from a moped or motorcycle. In a day when gasoline engine and transmission designs were in their infancy, and power-to-weight ratios were low, a dual-purpose propulsion system seemed particularly advantageous. As time went on, pedal propulsion was increasingly replaced by constant use of <b>a</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> four-stroke gasoline engine. Nevertheless, the concept of using motor assist for the ordinary bicycle has persisted, and the concept has periodically resurfaced over the years, particularly in times of austerity or fuel shortages. In countries where automobiles and/or fuels are prohibitively expensive, the motorized bicycle has enjoyed continued popularity as a primary mode of transportation.|$|E
25|$|Modern ploughs {{are usually}} {{multiple}} reversible ploughs, {{mounted on a}} tractor via a three-point linkage. These commonly have between two {{and as many as}} seven mouldboards– and semi-mounted ploughs (the lifting of which is supplemented by a wheel about halfway along their length) can have as many as eighteen mouldboards. The hydraulic system of the tractor is used to lift and reverse the implement, as well as to adjust furrow width and depth. The ploughman still has to set the draughting linkage from the tractor so that the plough is carried at the proper angle in the soil. This angle and depth can be controlled automatically by modern tractors. As a complement to the rear plough <b>a</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three mouldboards-plough can be mounted {{on the front of the}} tractor if it is equipped with front three-point linkage.|$|E
25|$|Branyan {{rejected}} a one-year {{offer from the}} Mariners on November 10. He stated {{that the reason for}} the decline was because he wanted a contract that lasted for more than one year, possibly <b>a</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three-year contract. Branyan also stated that he still wanted to return to Seattle, but would rather test the free agent market than settle for anything less than a two-year contract. On January 7, 2010, the Seattle Mariners traded infielder Bill Hall for first baseman Casey Kotchman. For Branyan, this meant it was unlikely the Mariners would offer him a new contract as Kotchman would be the likely candidate for the starting job at first base, vacated by Branyan. On February 2, 2010, ESPN.com reported that the Florida Marlins had offered a one-year contract to Branyan. On February 5, a conflicting report stated that the Marlins had not offered Branyan a contract. On February 9, Foxsports.com reported that Branyan has drawn interest from both the Cleveland Indians, and the Toronto Blue Jays. Joe Frisaro, writer for MLB.com, reported on February 13, that the Marlins were not interested in signing Branyan. It was reported by Foxsports.com on February 16, that the Tampa Bay Rays, the Boston Red Sox, and the Cleveland Indians were interested in signing Branyan. That day, the Indians offered Branyan a one-year major league contract, according to MLB.com. On February 17, it was reported by Foxsports.com that the Red Sox were no longer interested in Branyan.|$|E

Since 2017, Australia qualifies for the World Cup through competing in the FIBA Women's Asia Cup, held each 4 years in the year preceding the Women's World Cup.

500|$|Gordon and Silver {{moved the}} project to Warner Bros., where Terry Gilliam was {{attached}} to direct. Unsatisfied with how Hamm's script fleshed out the characters, Gilliam brought in Charles McKeown to rewrite it. The second draft, which was credited to Gilliam, Warren Skaaren, and Hamm rather than McKeown, used the character Rorschach's journal as a voice-over, and restored scenes from the comic book that Hamm had removed. According to Watchmen artist Dave Gibbons, filming was to take place at Pinewood Studios. Silver wanted to cast Arnold Schwarzenegger as Dr. Manhattan. Because both Gilliam and Silver's previous films, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen and Die Hard 2 respectively, went over budget, they were only able to raise $25 million for the film—a quarter of the necessary budget. As a result, Gilliam abandoned the project, and ultimately decided that Watchmen was unfilmable. Gilliam explained, [...] "Reducing [...] to <b>a</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> two-and-a-half hour film [...] {{seemed to me to}} take away the essence of what Watchmen is about." [...] When Warner Bros. dropped the project, Gordon invited Gilliam back to helm the film independently. The director again declined, believing that the comic book would be better directed as a five-hour miniseries.|$|E

In one of the houses, where most of Jashari's extended family had gathered, a mortar shell fell in through the roof, causing many deaths.

Also killed were Jashari's wife, Adilje, and his thirteen-year-old son, Kushtrim. Overall, approximately fifty-eight Kosovo Albanians {{were killed in the}} attack, including eighteen women and ten {{children under the age of}} sixteen.

500|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} attempts {{to make a film}} version of Watchmen since 1986, when producers Lawrence Gordon and Joel Silver acquired film rights to the series for 20th Century Fox. Fox asked Alan Moore to write a screenplay based on his story, but he declined, so the studio enlisted screenwriter Sam Hamm. Hamm took the liberty of re-writing Watchmens complicated ending into a [...] "more manageable" [...] conclusion involving an assassination and a time paradox. Fox put the project into turnaround in 1991, and the project was moved to Warner Bros., where Terry Gilliam was attached to direct and Charles McKeown to rewrite it.
