40|$|Larval feeding by {{the wood}} borer Aenetus uirescens is characterised by an initial diet of dead wood and {{fungal fruiting bodies}} ("litter-phase") {{followed}} by a transition to callus tissue of trees and shrubs for the main period of larval development ("tree-phase). Larvae of both stages exhibit gut <b>activity</b> <b>to</b> laminarin and starch, showing the potential to digest 0 -(1, 3) and a-(1, 4) glucans respectively. Although fl-(1, 3) glucans are rare in vascular plants {{it is suggested that}} they may be present in the diet of A. uirescens as callose. Gut <b>activity</b> <b>to</b> laminarin and starch was also confirmed for the foliage feeding Wiseana, indicating that the ability to digest 0 -(1, 3) glucans may be widespread in the Hepialidae. Tree-phase gut activity was recorded for galactomannan, very weak <b>activity</b> <b>to</b> carboxymethyl cellulose and no <b>activity</b> <b>to</b> chitin. The litter-phase exhibited very weak <b>activity</b> <b>to</b> chitin, but no <b>activity</b> <b>to</b> carboxymethyl cellulose...|$|R

5|$|Another large {{organization}} was Polskie Towarzystwo Turystyczne ‘Beskid Śląski’ (Polish Tourist Association ‘Silesian Beskids’) established in 1910.

In the 1930s it associated 27 local branches. After World War II it operated half-legally and as Siła, was liquidated by Czechoslovak communist authorities after the Victorious February 1948.

5|$|Behavior theorists see delaying {{gratification}} as {{an adaptive}} skill. It {{has been shown}} that learning to delay gratification promotes positive social behavior, such as sharing and positive peer interactions. For example, students who learn to delay gratification are better able to complete their assigned <b>activities.</b> <b>To</b> put it simply, if someone undertakes an activity with the promise of a delayed reward after, the task's completion becomes more likely.|$|E
40|$|Depersonalization disorder, {{characterized}} by emotional detachment, {{has been associated}} with increased prefrontal cortical and decreased autonomic <b>activity</b> <b>to</b> emotional stimuli. Event-related fMRI with simultaneous measurements of skin conductance levels occurred in nine depersonalization disorder patients and 12 normal controls to neutral, mild and intense happy and sad facial expressions. Patients, but not controls, showed decreases in subcortical limbic <b>activity</b> <b>to</b> increasingly intense happy and sad facial expressions, respectively. For both happy and sad expressions, negative correlations between skin conductance measures in bilateral dorsal prefrontal cortices occurred only in depersonalization disorder patients. Abnormal decreases in limbic <b>activity</b> <b>to</b> increasingly intense emotional expressions, and increases in dorsal prefrontal cortical <b>activity</b> <b>to</b> emotionally arousing stimuli may underlie the emotional detachment of depersonalization disorder...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{spectrum}} {{approach was}} used to examine contributions of comorbid symptom dimensions of substance abuse and eating disorder to abnormal prefrontal-cortical and subcortical-striatal <b>activity</b> <b>to</b> happy and fear faces previously demonstrated in bipolar disorder (BD). Method: Fourteen remitted BD-type I and sixteen healthy individuals viewed neutral, mild and intense happy and fear faces in two event-related fMRI experiments. All individuals completed Substance-Use and Eating-Disorder Spectrum measures. Region-of-Interest analyses for bilateral prefrontal and subcortical-striatal regions were performed. Results: BD individuals scored significantly higher on these spectrum measures than healthy individuals (p < 0. 05), and were distinguished by activity in prefrontal and subcortical-striatal regions. BD relative to healthy individuals showed reduced dorsal prefrontal-cortical <b>activity</b> <b>to</b> all faces. Only BD individuals showed greater subcortical-striatal <b>activity</b> <b>to</b> happy and neutral faces. In BD individuals, negative correlations were shown between substance use severity and right PFC <b>activity</b> <b>to</b> intense happy faces (p < 0. 04), and between substance use severity and right caudate nucleus <b>activity</b> <b>to</b> neutral faces (p < 0. 03). Positive correlations were shown between eating disorder and right ventral putamen <b>activity</b> <b>to</b> intense happy (p < 0. 02) and neutral faces (p < 0. 03). Exploratory analyses revealed few significant relationships between illness variables and medication upon neural activity in BD individuals. Limitations: Small sample size of predominantly medicated BD individuals. Conclusion: This study is the first to report relationships between comorbid symptom dimensions of substance abuse and eating disorder and prefrontal-cortical and subcortical-striatal <b>activity</b> <b>to</b> facial expressions in BD. Our findings suggest that these comorbid features may contribute to observed patterns of functional abnormalities in neural systems underlying mood regulation in BD...|$|R
