5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, players are given an introductory level and boss to overcome. Afterward, they are given access to eight different stages, each representing one of the above-mentioned Robot Masters. At the end of each stage, players must battle <b>a</b> <b>Robot</b> Master. When <b>a</b> <b>Robot</b> Master is destroyed, it will give Mega Man its respective weapon, which can be used against other Robot Masters or enemies but has limited ammunition. If Mega Man defeats the Robot Master using his primary weapon, the Robot Master will be captured and reprogrammed. This allows players to play through stages as one of the Robot Masters.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – <b>A</b> {{conversational}} <b>robot</b> {{can take}} on different personas that have more or less common ground with users. With more common ground, communication is more efficient. We studied this process experimentally. A “male” or “female ” robot queried subjects about romantic dating norms. We expected subjects to assume <b>a</b> female <b>robot</b> knows more about dating norms than <b>a</b> male <b>robot.</b> If so, subjects should describe dating norms efficiently to <b>a</b> female <b>robot</b> but to elaborate on these norms to <b>a</b> male <b>robot.</b> Subjects, especially women discussing norms for women, used more words explaining dating norms to the male <b>robot</b> than to <b>a</b> female <b>robot.</b> We suggest that through simple changes in <b>a</b> <b>robot’s</b> persona, we can elicit different levels of information from users—less if the robot’s goal is efficient speech, more, if the robot’s goal is redundancy, description, explanation, and elaboration.

Razer outlasted Vercingetorix, SpawnofScutter, Behemoth and AttilatheDrum to set up a final against Onslaught. An attack by Razer's arm on one of Onslaught's rear wheels saw its adversary shed a tyre, lose grip, and drive into an area patrolled by Matilda. The house robot flipped Onslaught onto its side, rendering it immobile. Assured of victory, Razer attacked and badly damaged Matilda's bodywork and rear shell.|$|E

40|$|Deception is an {{essential}} social behavior for humans, and we can observe human deceptive behaviors {{in a variety of}} contexts including sports, culture, education, war, and everyday life. Deception is also used for the purpose of survival in animals and even in plants. From these findings, it is obvious that deception is a general and essential behavior for any species, which raises an interesting research question: can deception be {{an essential}} characteristic for robots, especially social robots? Based on this curiosity, this dissertation aimed to develop <b>a</b> <b>robot's</b> deception capabilities, especially in human-robot interaction (HRI) situations. Specifically, the goal of this dissertation is to develop <b>a</b> social <b>robot's</b> deceptive behaviors that can produce benefits for the deceived humans (other-oriented robot deception). To achieve other-oriented robot deception, several scientific contributions were accomplished in this dissertation. A novel taxonomy of robot deception was defined, and a general computational model for <b>a</b> <b>robot's</b> deceptive behaviors was developed based on criminological law. Appropriate HRI contexts in which <b>a</b> <b>robot's</b> other-oriented deception can generate benefits were explored, and a methodology for evaluating <b>a</b> <b>robot's</b> other-oriented deception in appropriate HRI contexts was designed, and studies were conducted with human subjects. Finally, the ethical implications of other-oriented robot deception were also explored and thoughtfully discussed. Ph. D...|$|R
