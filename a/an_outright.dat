5|$|It was {{announced}} on May 3, 2016, that Albrecht would play his {{final year of}} collegiate basketball at Purdue University. With their win over Indiana on February 28, 2017, Purdue clinched at least {{a share of the}} Big Ten regular season championship. With Wisconsin's loss on March 2, Purdue clinched <b>an</b> <b>outright</b> championship, their 23rd championship, the most in Big Ten history.|$|E
5|$|Stylistically, many {{commentators}} have described The Oceanides as either <b>an</b> <b>outright</b> example of Impressionism or somehow derivative of that art movement. Others have countered that Sibelius's active {{development of the}} two subjects, his sparing use of scales favored by Impressionists, and his prioritization of action and structure over ephemeral, atmospheric background distinguish the piece from quintessential examples, such as Debussy's La mer.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{comic book}} about sentient {{chickens}} could have been fantasy or science fiction, he decided to make it <b>an</b> <b>outright</b> drama. The storyline eventually became too serious for a title as silly as Ultimate Chicken Story, so he changed it to Elmer. The story was fully planned when he began work on the first issue, and he wrote it in English because he wanted an international audience.|$|E

5000|$|The play {{of shadows}} upon {{buildings}} {{was very much}} in vogue a thousand years ago as evidenced by the surviving examples of [...] "mukarnas" [...] art where the shadows of 3 dimensional ornamentation with stone masonry around the entrance of mosques form pictures. <b>As</b> <b>outright</b> pictures were avoided in Islam, tessellations and calligraphic pictures were allowed, [...] "accidental" [...] silhouettes are a creative alternative.|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Imperial Census of 1897, the {{population}} of the approximate area of modern Odessa Oblast was 1,115,949. According to that census, 33.9% of the population was ethnic Ukrainian, 26.7% was ethnic Russian, 16.1% was ethnic Jewish, 9.2% was ethnic Moldavian, 8.6% was ethnic German, 2% was ethnic Polish, and 1.6% was ethnic Bulgarian. These numbers show that there was a high level of ethnic diversity in the region, and that no group had <b>an</b> <b>outright</b> majority.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the 2006 U-20 World Cup, Nécib began playing full-time with the senior team participating in qualification matches for the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup. During the season, Nécib also played with the team at the 2006 edition of the Algarve Cup. On 22 April 2006, she played with the team in a 5–0 World Cup qualification win against Hungary. Afterwards, Nécib failed to appear with the team in its final three qualification matches as France missed the World Cup after drawing 1–1 with England in its final qualifying match. France needed <b>an</b> <b>outright</b> victory to qualify for the tournament.|$|E

In the May 2016 Democratic primary {{election}}, Jones came within sixty votes of <b>an</b> <b>outright</b> victory, but was forced into a runoff election with Rhonda Taylor. Jones won the July runoff election and in November 2016, once again won election to the Georgia House, defeating Republican Carl Anuszczyk.|$|E

The U.S. launches [...] "Operation Echo Wave" [...] and dispatches a naval fleet off the coast of South Zagoria to aid the Chernarussian Defense Forces (CDF) in their retaking of the province.|$|R
5|$|Mosley {{came up with}} an {{innovative}} way to dispose of the FIA's involvement in the commercial activities of Formula One. In order to maintain Ecclestone's investment to deliver digital television, he proposed extending Ecclestone's rights for F1 coverage to 100 years from the initial 15, arguing that a deal of such length could not be anti-competition as it was effectively the same as <b>an</b> <b>outright</b> sale. The Commission agreed with his assessment and in the interest of impartiality, Mosley removed himself from the negotiations, which eventually returned around $300 million (£150 million).|$|E
5|$|On 13 October 1999, the NDA, {{without the}} AIADMK, won 303 seats in {{parliament}} and thus <b>an</b> <b>outright</b> majority. The BJP had its highest ever tally of 183. Vajpayee became Prime Minister {{for the third}} time; Advani became Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister. This NDA government lasted its full term of five years. Its policy agenda included a more aggressive stance on defence and terror as well as neo-liberal economic policies.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} the Prince of Wales's debts, which {{amounted}} to the extraordinary sum of £630,000 (equivalent to £ today) in 1795, was solved (at least temporarily) by Parliament. Being unwilling to make <b>an</b> <b>outright</b> grant to relieve these debts, it provided him an additional sum of £65,000 (equivalent to £ today) per annum. In 1803, a further £60,000 (equivalent to £ today) was added, and George's debts of 1795 were finally cleared in 1806, although the debts he had incurred since 1795 remained.|$|E

5|$|The vote {{share of}} the BJP was 31% of all votes cast, a low figure {{relative}} {{to the number of}} seats it won. This was the first instance since 1984 of a single party achieving <b>an</b> <b>outright</b> majority in the Indian Parliament and the first time that it achieved a majority in the Lok Sabha on its own strength. Support was concentrated in the Hindi-speaking belt in North-central India. The magnitude of the victory was not predicted by most opinion and exit polls.|$|E
5|$|After this success, which {{secured the}} Balkans, Maurice {{intended}} to consolidate Roman control {{by bringing in}} Armenian settlers who would be given land in exchange for military service. To this end, Priscus was sent to Armenia to recruit men and their families. His mission there, however, {{was interrupted by a}} large-scale military revolt that brought about the downfall of Maurice. In 602, Maurice again ordered his troops on the Danube frontier to winter north of the river. Again, this provoked widespread discontent, and when Peter, who had replaced Priscus, refused to bow down and rescind the order, <b>an</b> <b>outright</b> mutiny broke out. The army chose the officer Phocas as its new leader and marched down to Constantinople. Without any credible military forces of his own, Maurice had to flee, but was captured with his family and executed by Phocas, who now became emperor.|$|E
5|$|Although the British {{ships were}} {{substantially}} larger than any individual French vessel, the frigates were more numerous and more manoeuvrable. Neither side {{could afford to}} take significant damage in the battle, so each sought to drive the other off rather than achieve <b>an</b> <b>outright</b> victory. On 9 September Sercey's frigates formed a line of battle, successfully engaging first Arrogant and then Victorious and inflicting damage on each while preventing them from supporting one another. The French frigates, particularly Vertu and Seine, also suffered and by late morning both sides disengaged, the British retiring to Madras for repairs while Sercey anchored at King's Island in the Mergui Archipelago, eventually sheltering in Batavia.|$|E

5|$|But {{the emperor}} {{rejected}} <b>an</b> <b>outright</b> invasion. Just {{coming off a}} disastrous Japanese campaign, the emperor was unwilling to commit the central government troops to what he considered a low priority affair. He was now focused on delivering the final blow against the Song; the emperor ordered the Yunnan provincial army to secure the borderlands in order to block the escape path of the Song refugees. He also sanctioned a limited border war if Pagan contested the takeover. As planned, the Yunnan army proceeded to consolidate the borderlands in 1275–76. Elsewhere, the main Mongol armies had captured most of the Song territory by 1276.|$|E
5|$|Karthik {{made his}} debut at the {{first-class}} level in late-2002 against Baroda, playing as a wicket-keeper and batting at No. 8, where he scored 37. He batted throughout the round-robin phase in five matches, scoring 179 runs {{at an average}} of 35.80 with a top score of 88* against Uttar Pradesh in his second match. This innings helped Tamil Nadu to avoid <b>an</b> <b>outright</b> defeat, hanging on for a draw with one wicket in hand. However his form tapered off after this match and he failed to pass 20 again during the season. He took 11 catches, but due to his repeated wicket-keeping errors, he was dropped for the final matches.|$|E
5|$|Puffins {{have been}} hunted by man since time immemorial. Coastal {{communities}} and island dwellers with few natural resources at their disposal, made {{good use of}} the seafoods that they found on their cliffs and shores. Puffins were caught and eaten fresh, salted in brine or smoked and dried. Their feathers were used in bedding and their eggs were eaten, {{but not to the}} same extent as those of some other seabirds, being more difficult to extract from the nest. In most countries, Atlantic puffins are now protected by legislation, and in the countries where hunting is still permitted, strict laws prevent over-exploitation. They are still caught and eaten in Iceland and the Faroe Islands, but there have been calls for <b>an</b> <b>outright</b> ban on hunting them in Iceland because of concern over the dwindling number of birds successfully raising chicks.|$|E

5|$|The Bharatiya Janata Party {{was officially}} created in 1980, {{and the first}} general {{election}} it contested was in 1984, in which it won only two Lok Sabha seats. Following the election in 1996, the BJP became the largest party in the Lok Sabha for the first time, but the government it formed was short-lived. In the elections of 1998 and 1999, it remained the largest party, and headed the ruling coalition on both occasions. In the 2014 general election, it won <b>an</b> <b>outright</b> majority in parliament. From 1991 onwards, a BJP member has led the Opposition whenever the party was not in power. For the electoral results of the BJP's predecessors, see the JP and BJS articles.|$|E
5|$|The {{city was}} home {{to at least one}} al-Qaeda leader before bin Laden. Operational chief Abu Faraj al-Libi {{reportedly}} moved his family to Abbottabad in mid-2003. Pakistan Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) raided the house in December 2003 but did not find him. However, this account was exposed as <b>an</b> <b>outright</b> lie by American officials who said that satellite photos show that in 2004 the site was an empty field. A courier told interrogators that al-Libi used three houses in Abbottabad. Pakistani officials say they informed their American counterparts {{at the time that the}} city could be a hiding place for al-Qaeda leaders. In 2009 officials began providing the U.S. with intelligence about bin Laden's compound without knowing who lived there.|$|E
5|$|Utopia, Limited (1893), their {{penultimate}} opera, was a {{very modest}} success, and their last, The Grand Duke (1896), was <b>an</b> <b>outright</b> failure. Neither work entered the canon of regularly performed Gilbert and Sullivan works until the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company made the first complete professional recordings of the two operas in the 1970s. Gilbert had also offered Sullivan another libretto, His Excellency (1894), but Gilbert's insistence on casting Nancy McIntosh, his protege from Utopia, led to Sullivan's refusal, and His Excellency was instead composed by F. Osmond Carr. Meanwhile, the Savoy Theatre continued to revive the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, in between new pieces, and D'Oyly Carte touring companies also played them in repertory.|$|E
