On one occasion in Texas, they told their followers of a forthcoming visitation from extraterrestrials and instructed them to wait outside all night, at which point they informed them that this had been merely a test. Lalich sees this as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> increased their students' devotion, ensuring that their commitment became irrespective of what they saw. Members became desperate for Applewhite's approval, which he used to control them.|$|E
5|$|Just like glucocorticoids, SEGRAMs bind to and {{activate}} GR. However, {{in contrast}} to glucocorticoids, SEGRAMs selectively activate the GR in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> yield an improved therapeutic benefit. Generally, for specific inflammation-based diseases, SEGRAMs should more strongly transrepress than transactivate, or better yet solely transrepress and fail to transactivate. This type of selective GR activation should result in fewer side effects than the expected side effects that appear with a chronic treatment with classic glucocorticoids.|$|E

5|$|Drugs {{are tested}} {{by the people who}} {{manufacture}} them, in poorly designed trials, on hopelessly small numbers of weird, unrepresentative patients, and analysed using techniques which are flawed by design, in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> exaggerate the benefits of treatments. Unsurprisingly, these trials tend to produce results that favour the manufacturer. When trials throw up results that companies don't like, they are perfectly entitled to hide them from doctors and patients, so we only ever see a distorted picture of any drug's true effects. Regulators see most of the trial data, but only from early on in a drug's life, and even then they don't give this data to doctors or patients, or even to other parts of government. This distorted evidence is then communicated and applied in a distorted fashion.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{the assumed}} role of these jamaat members cycle in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> may be engaged as a preacher, a cook or as a cleaner at other times. Among Tabligh Jamaat members, this is {{generally}} {{referred to as}} khidmat which essentially connotes to serving their companions and freeing them for tablighi engagements. The members of the Jamaat are assigned these roles based on the day's mashwara. The markaz keeps records of each jamaat and its members, the identity of whom is verified from their respective mosques. Mosques are used to assist the tablighi activities of individual jamaats that voluntarily undertake preaching missions. Members of a jamaat, ideally, pay expenses themselves {{so as to avoid}} financial dependence on anyone.|$|E
5|$|Mayfly nymphs {{may serve}} as hosts for parasites such as {{nematodes}} and trematodes. Some of these affect the nymphs' behaviour in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> become {{more likely to be}} predated. Other nematodes turn adult male mayflies into quasi-females which haunt the edges of streams, enabling the parasites to break their way out into the aqueous environment they need to complete their life cycles. The nymphs can also serve as intermediate hosts for the horsehair worm Paragordius varius, which causes its definitive host, a grasshopper, to jump into water and drown.|$|E

5|$|Molyneux {{was known}} as a {{mathematician}} and maker of mathematical instruments such as compasses and hourglasses. He became acquainted with many prominent men of the day, including the writer Richard Hakluyt and the mathematicians Robert Hues and Edward Wright. He also knew the explorers Thomas Cavendish, Francis Drake, Walter Raleigh and John Davis. Davis probably introduced Molyneux to his own patron, the London merchant William Sanderson, who largely financed the construction of the globes. When completed, the globes were presented to Elizabeth I. Larger globes were acquired by royalty, noblemen and academic institutions, while smaller ones were purchased as practical navigation aids for sailors and students. The globes were the first to be made in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were unaffected by the humidity at sea, and they came into general use on ships.|$|E
5|$|Voting {{during the}} three shows {{consisted}} of 50 percent public televoting and 50 percent from a jury deliberation. The jury consisted of five music industry professionals who were citizens of the country they represent, with their names published before the contest to ensure transparency. This jury was asked to judge each contestant based on vocal capacity, the stage performance, the song's composition and originality, and the overall impression of the act. In addition, no member of a national jury could be related {{in any way to}} any of the competing acts in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could not vote impartially and independently. The individual rankings of each jury member were released shortly after the grand final.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{the ways in which}} {{professional}} learning groups in schools can contribute to whole school improvement. It discusses two sites in which there has been a review of the evidence that has been collected at the school or through the literature over time in order to explore the implications for the continuing improvement of teaching and learning. It has long been argued that there are links between school-wide development, staff development and classroom development for improvement to occur. In these studies, all three elements have been present. The paper discusses the strategies adopted for the creation of professional learning groups across the schools where those groups are structured in such <b>a</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are founded upon learning that is evidence-based, visible and collaborative, and where the agreed purpose has been whole school improvement...|$|R
