500|$|In 2012, several peer-reviewed {{independent}} {{studies were}} published showing that neonicotinoids had previously undetected routes of exposure affecting bees including through dust, pollen, and nectar and that subnanogram toxicity resulted in failure {{to return to}} the hive without immediate lethality, one primary symptom of CCD.

These reports prompted a formal peer review by the European Food Safety Authority, which stated in January 2013 that some neonicotinoids pose an unacceptably high risk to bees, and identified several data gaps not previously considered.

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1957, Khrushchev was at <b>acute</b> <b>risk</b> of losing power, as the Anti-Party Group {{composed}} of former Stalin allies Lazar Kaganovich, Georgy Malenkov, and Vyacheslav Molotov launched an attempt to replace Khrushchev as General Secretary of the Communist Party (effectively {{the leader of the}} Soviet Union) with Nikolai Bulganin, then the Premier of the Soviet Union. The attempted ouster, which was foiled in June, was followed by a series of actions by Khrushchev to consolidate power.

40|$|Aims: To {{investigate}} the proposal that lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) {{contributes to the}} acute phase response and thus possibly to the <b>acute</b> cardiac <b>risks</b> associated with major physical effort. Methods/Results: Fit, healthy, British army recruits were reviewed {{at the beginning and}} the end of a 10 week programme of basic training concluding with an intense 48 hour military exercise. Final recruit assessment was staggered over the last week of training, giving rise to six recruit groups, with determination of Lp(a), C reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, albumin, and total creatine kinase values from 12 hours to five days after the final exercise. A clear acute phase response was seen following the final exercise, marked by a significant increase in circulating concentrations of fibrinogen and a reduction of albumin, and a trend with non-significant increases in CRP. Conclusion: Lp(a) did not behave as an early marker of the acute response. Previous reports may have been confounded by concurrent disease in older subjects and by late sampling. Lp(a) determination for cardiovascular risk profiling is not confounded by associated physical effort. It is also unlikely that the <b>acute</b> <b>risks</b> of major physical effort are enhanced by any process involving Lp(a). ...|$|R

40|$|In space {{exploration}} outside the Earth s geomagnetic field, radiation exposure from solar particle events (SPE) presents a health concern for astronauts, that could impair their performance {{and result in}} possible failure of the mission. <b>Acute</b> <b>risks</b> are of special concern during extra-vehicular activities because of the rapid onset of SPE. However, most SPEs will not lead to <b>acute</b> <b>risks</b> but can lead to mission disruption if accurate projection methods are not available. Acute Radiation Sickness (ARS) {{is a group of}} clinical syndromes developing acutely (within several seconds to 3 days) after high dose whole-body or significant partial-body ionizing radiation exposures. The manifestation of these syndromes reflects the disturbance of physiological processes of various cellular groups damaged by radiation. Hematopoietic cells, skin, epithelium, intestine, and vascular endothelium are among the most sensitive tissues of human body to ionizing radiation. Most ARS symptoms are directly related to these tissues and other systems (nervous, endocrine, and cardiovascular, etc.) with coupled regulations. Here we report the progress in bio-mathematical models to describe the dose and time-dependent early human responses to ionizing radiation. The responses include lymphocyte depression, granulocyte modulation, fatigue and weakness syndrome, and upper gastrointestinal distress. The modest dose and dose-rates of SPEs are predicted to lead to large sparing of ARS, however detailed experimental data on a range of proton dose-rates for organ doses from 0. 5 to 2 Gy is needed to validate the models. We also report on the ARRBOD code that integrates the BRYNTRN and SUMDOSE codes, which are used to estimate the SPE organ doses for astronauts under various space travel scenarios, with our models of ARS.
