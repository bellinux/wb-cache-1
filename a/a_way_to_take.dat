Abdah thought that slavery was wrong and agreed to {{transport}} Bok to the town of Ed-Da'Ein {{in the back of his}} truck amongst his cargo of grain and onions. Bok stayed with Abdah, his wife and two sons for two months while Abdah tried to find <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Bok to Khartoum, the capital city of Sudan. When he could not find a friend to provide passage to Khartoum, Abdah bought a bus ticket to Khartoum for Bok. Francis Bok arrived in Khartoum with no money, no place to go, and did not know where to turn. Fortunately for Francis, another stranger helped him find his way to his fellow Dinka tribespeople in Khartoum in the Jabarona settlement.|$|E
25|$|Gambino and Lucchese assumed {{full control}} of the Mafia Commission. In 1960, they backed the Gallo {{brothers}} in their rebellion against Profaci family boss Joe Profaci. Gambino and Lucchese saw the war as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over rackets from the distracted Profaci's. After uncovering a plot by Joseph Bonanno to assassinate them, Lucchese and Gambino used the Commission to strip Bonanno of his role as boss. This power play started a war within the Bonanno family and served to strengthen both the Lucchese and Gambino families.|$|E
25|$|Hayes, having bet {{the company}} on a system that was never {{actually}} deployed, had no new products in the pipeline. In an attempt at diversification in January 1991 it had acquired most of the assets of local area network software developer Waterloo Microsystems Inc of Waterloo, Ontario and belatedly entered the operating system (OS) market in June 1991 with LANstep, a network OS for small offices, but this was subsequently abandoned in 1994 {{in the face of}} stiff competition particularly from Novell NetWare. An effort was started to move into the market for ADSL and cable modems, but this was a multi-year effort during a period when USR increasingly took over the market. They entered Chapter 11 protection in November 1994, exiting in October 1995 as Hayes Corp. after selling 49% of the company to Nortel and a Singapore-based venture capital firm. In 1997 they merged with Access Beyond, a builder of ISP rack-mount modems and terminal servers, and changed the company name again, this time to Hayes Communications. The merger was primarily <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the company public. The stock started crashing over the next year, from around US$12 in early 1998 to pennies in October, when they once again filed for Chapter 11 protection. No new funding could be found, and in 1999 the company assets were liquidated.|$|E

500|$|Together with British Waterways, the Inland Waterways Association and the Waterway Recovery Group, the Society {{began the}} work of {{restoration}} of the canal to navigation, a process which is still ongoing. A major development was the granting of permission in 1992 to remove an old railway embankment, which blocked the route {{near the top of}} the Woolsthorpe flight of locks. The task was completed by a number of Waterway Recovery Group workcamps. New gates were fitted to the top three locks, and rebuilding of Casthorpe bridge was funded by Lincolnshire County Council, opening up [...] of the canal for navigation. Further down the canal, restoration of a [...] section between Hickling Basin and Hose was funded by a derelict land grant of £400,000, received in 1993. The Grantham Canal Partnership was formed in 1997, as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the project forwards. It consisted of representatives from each of the six local authorities through which the route passes, British Waterways, the Inland Waterways Association, the Grantham Canal Restoration Society and the Grantham Navigation Association, a group which had split off from the Canal Society in 1992. As a result of the co-operation, British Waterways formulated a draft business plan for the canal.|$|E
500|$|After {{searching for}} {{prospective}} collaborators, Madonna chose {{to work with}} Babyface, whose previous work with artists like Whitney Houston, Boyz II Men, and Toni Braxton had resulted in successful smooth R songs. She was also fond of Babyface's song, [...] "When Can I See You" [...] from his third studio album For the Cool in You (1994). The singer's management called Babyface {{to set up a}} meeting and see if they wanted to work together. Once met, both were surprised by their camaraderie and wanted to write songs. Madonna came over to Babyface's house and after a couple of days they came up with two songs. One of them was based on a piece of music composed by Babyface, but he was not sure about its musical direction. He made Madonna listen to the composition, and she found <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the song forward. Babyface clarified that [...] "t was just a beat and the chords. From there we collaborated and built it up... I was living in Beverly Hills and I created a little studio in my house, so she came over there to write." [...] Together they agreed that the first line of the song should be its title, and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] was written. The words were never repeated in the track again.|$|E

She then began {{competing}} {{more frequently in}} matches, including intergender tag team matches alongside Homicide and Hernandez. Salinas participated at Lockdown in the first ever [...] "Queen of the Cage" [...] match, which was won by Roxxi Laveaux. After a Knockouts [...] "Makeover Battle Royal" [...] was announced for the Sacrifice pay-per-view, where one Knockout would get their head shaved, Salinas competed in a match to gain immunity from the head shaving on the May 8 episode of Impact!, but was unsuccessful. At Sacrifice, the [...] "Makeover Battle Royal" [...] was won by Gail Kim, and Roxxi Laveaux had her head shaved. The same night, Salinas and Hector Guerrero were {{in the corner of}} LAX as they won the TNA World Tag Team Championship. As part of LAX's feud with Beer Money, Inc., Salinas wrestled their manager Jackie Moore on Impact! in June 2008, but lost by submission. She participated in a gauntlet battle royal match for the number one contendership to the TNA Women's Knockout Championship, but was unsuccessful, and a few weeks later lost a three-on-one handicap match to Awesome Kong and The Beautiful People (Velvet Sky and Angelina Love). After Beer Money, Inc. won the TNA World Tag Team Championship from LAX, the two teams began feuding, and at No Surrender in September, Salinas was attacked off camera by their manager Jackie Moore. This storyline was put in place as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Martinez off television, as she had quit TNA to film an Italian thriller movie.|$|E
500|$|In June 2008, Spears' manager Larry Rudolph told The Sun that a {{video for}} [...] "Radar" [...] {{directed}} by Spears {{was to be}} shot in Chelsea, London. The concept would have Spears and her friends chasing a man in different clubs. However, this was scrapped along with the single’s release. The music video for [...] "Radar" [...] from Circus was filmed on May 27 and 28, 2009, at the Bacara Resort & Spa located in Santa Barbara, California. It was directed by Dave Meyers, who previously worked with Spears on her music videos for [...] "Lucky", [...] "Boys" [...] and [...] "Outrageous" [...] {{as well as the}} Curious commercials. Meyers claimed the video pays tribute to the music video of Madonna's 1994 single [...] "Take a Bow". He added, [...] " [...] looking for <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> her into a contemporary, classy environment. I felt empowered by referencing Madonna's video. Britney hasn't done anything like that". He had a very clear idea of how he wanted the story line to work: [...] "There is a narrative going on, a romantic triangle on a weekend at this polo mansion," [...] he said. [...] "A soap-opera romance." [...] Meyers commented that working with Spears again was [...] "a great celebration of trusting one another", explaining that both wanted [...] "to do something fresh and new, seeking out an actual different technique and stylistic choices and trying to find a form to celebrate them in." [...] Since the song was not the first single from Circus, Meyers chose to experiment and not have dancing scenes, saying that [...] "the videos are a chance for her to vocalize a sense of herself. The media tends to attack her, so I thought, 'Let's show the classy side of Britney and focus on a classy experience, very European-inspired'. And she's at the point in her career where I think this would be a nice step." [...] After the video was finished, Meyers said he was happy with the lack of dancing scenes, because the cuts and dissolves kept the pace of the song.|$|E
