5|$|Long-term {{misuse of}} alcohol {{can cause a}} wide range of mental health problems. Severe {{cognitive}} problems are common; approximately 10 percent of all dementia cases are related to alcohol consumption, making it the second leading cause of dementia. Excessive alcohol use causes damage to brain function, and psychological health can be increasingly affected over time. Social skills are significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain. The social skills that are impaired by alcohol abuse include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, prosody perception problems and theory of mind deficits; the ability to understand humour is also impaired in alcohol abusers. Psychiatric disorders are common in alcoholics, with as many as 25 percent suffering severe psychiatric disturbances. The most prevalent psychiatric symptoms are <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> <b>depression</b> disorders. Psychiatric symptoms usually initially worsen during alcohol withdrawal, but typically improve or disappear with continued abstinence. Psychosis, confusion, and organic brain syndrome may be caused by alcohol misuse, which can lead to a misdiagnosis such as schizophrenia. Panic disorder can develop or worsen {{as a direct result of}} long-term alcohol misuse.|$|E
5|$|Difficulty delaying {{gratification}} {{also plays}} a role in internalizing disorders like <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> <b>depression.</b> A hallmark behavior in anxiety is avoidance of feared or anxiety-provoking situations. By seeking the immediate relief that comes with avoidance, a person is succumbing to the pull of instant gratification over the larger reward from overcoming the fear and anxiety that caused the avoidance. Procrastination, which is often a reflection of anxiety, is a clear example: a person avoids a dreaded task by engaging in a more enjoyable immediate activity instead. Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a more jarring case of this anxiety-related struggle to delay gratification; someone with OCD is unable to resist compulsions that temporarily mitigate the torture of obsessive thoughts, even though these compulsions do not banish the obsessions in the long run. One experiment, however, did not find any significant differences between samples with OCD and healthy controls in delayed gratification, while finding substantially improved delayed gratification among those with obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. Depression is also associated with lower capacity to delay gratification, though the direction of cause and effect is not clear. A depressed person who has difficulty pushing him or herself to engage in previously enjoyed activities is (deliberately or not) prioritizing short-term comfort and is demonstrating an impaired ability to delay gratification. There is evidence that individuals who engage in deliberate self-harm (i.e., cut themselves) are less able to tolerate emotional distress but are more able to tolerate physical pain. Thus it is argued that they injure themselves because they cannot delay gratification and need a way to end emotional pain quickly.|$|E

5|$|Severe acute {{withdrawal}} {{symptoms such as}} delirium tremens and seizures rarely occur after 1-week post cessation of alcohol. The acute withdrawal phase {{can be defined as}} lasting between one and three weeks. In the period of 3–6 weeks following cessation increased anxiety, depression, as well as sleep disturbance, is common; fatigue and tension can persist for up to 5 weeks as part of the post-acute withdrawal syndrome; about a quarter of alcoholics experience <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> <b>depression</b> for up to 2 years. These post-acute {{withdrawal symptoms}} have also been demonstrated in animal models of alcohol dependence and withdrawal. A kindling effect also occurs in alcoholics whereby each subsequent withdrawal syndrome is more severe than the previous withdrawal episode; this is due to neuroadaptations which occur as a result of periods of abstinence followed by re-exposure to alcohol. Individuals who have had multiple withdrawal episodes are more likely to develop seizures and experience more severe anxiety during withdrawal from alcohol than alcohol-dependent individuals without a history of past alcohol withdrawal episodes. The kindling effect leads to persistent functional changes in brain neural circuits as well as to gene expression. Kindling also results in the intensification of psychological symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. There are decision tools and questionnaires which help guide physicians in evaluating alcohol withdrawal. For example, the CIWA-Ar objectifies alcohol withdrawal symptoms in order to guide therapy decisions which allows for an efficient interview {{while at the same time}} retaining clinical usefulness, validity, and reliability, ensuring proper care for withdrawal patients, who can be in danger of death.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} {{whether there is an}} association between type of living environment (urban versus rural) <b>and</b> <b>anxiety,</b> <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> psychosis in the Scottish population. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics database on Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation and urban-rural classifications for 6505 data zones across Scotland. Multiple regression was used to test the association between prescriptions for psychotropic medication for <b>anxiety,</b> <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> psychosis, and type of living environment according to urban-rural classification, controlling for a range of socio-economic factors. RESULTS: Urban-rural classification significantly predicted poorer mental health both before (β=-. 29) and after (β=-. 20) controlling for a large number of socio-economic variables, with more urban areas having higher rates of prescription for psychotropic medication for <b>anxiety,</b> <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> psychosis. LIMITATIONS: The current study focussed on macro-level variables and did not include individual level data. As such, the study did not include data on individual diagnoses, but instead used drug prescriptions for <b>anxiety,</b> <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> psychosis as a proxy for level of affective disorders within data zones. CONCLUSION: More urban living environments in Scotland are associated with higher rates of prescription for psychotropic medication for <b>anxiety,</b> <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> psychosis...|$|R

Participants completed the Retrospective Self-Report of Childhood Inhibition scale (RSRCI), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies <b>Depression</b> scale (CES-D) <b>and</b> the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). We found that BI {{was positively correlated with}} depression, agoraphobia, social phobia (social <b>anxiety</b> disorder) <b>and</b> posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In addition, we found that BI, <b>anxiety</b> disorders <b>and</b> <b>depression</b> were not associated with CD 4 counts. Finally, we found no gender effects for BI, depression, CD 4 counts or any anxiety disorder diagnosis. While BI was linked to certain anxiety disorders, we found no evidence to suggest that BI, a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, and/or depressive symptoms were associated with CD 4 counts among HIV-positive adults. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.

40|$|A {{decrease}} {{in the quality of}} sleep is believed to cause <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> worsen <b>depression.</b> Comparisons of salivary melatonin levels with different factors including quality of sleep, state <b>and</b> trait <b>anxieties,</b> <b>and</b> <b>depression,</b> were conducted to examine whether there is a relationship between melatonin, presumably associated with sleep, and psychological stress. The saliva of healthy young females was collected during the daytime and before they went to bed at night (when they were awake and resting in a sitting position), and salivary melatonin levels were measured. The quality of sleep was scored using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) –-a questionnaire method. State <b>and</b> trait <b>anxieties,</b> <b>and</b> <b>depression</b> were scored using other questionnaire methods: the State-Trait <b>Anxiety</b> Inventory (STAI) <b>and</b> Self-Rating <b>Depression</b> Scale (SDS), respectively. The following findings were obtained: (1) Salivary melatonin levels measured during the daytime and before going to bed were higher in females with a high depression score, compared to those with a low score, and there was a correlation between the <b>depression</b> scores <b>and</b> salivary melatonin levels measured at night; and (2) salivary melatonin levels measured before going to bed at night (in a sitting position) were higher in females with a high state anxiety score, suggesting a correlation between state <b>anxiety</b> scores <b>and</b> salivary melatonin levels during the night. Both <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> a sense of anxiety are forms of psychological stress. Therefore, it is assumed that, when a person is under psychological stress, the action of melatonin as a ligand on its receptor is reduced. Meaning psychological stress may induce oxidative stress in the body. On the other hand, no correlation was noted between the quality of sleep and salivary melatonin levels during the night, presumably because saliva was collected when the subjects were awake and sitting, rather than sleeping...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} {{interest in the}} unique relationship that anxiety sensitivity (AS) holds with the <b>anxiety</b> disorders <b>and</b> <b>depression.</b> <b>Anxiety</b> sensitivity is the fear of arousal-related bodily sensations due to the personal belief that these symptoms will produce harmful consequences such as the loss of cognitive control, negative physical symptoms, {{and the fear of}} publicly observable symptoms (Reiss, 1991). Current research has examined the relationship between AS <b>and</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorders <b>and</b> <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> has found that high leveIs of AS are associated with the development of panic disorders, social anxiety, generalized <b>anxiety</b> disorder, <b>and</b> <b>depression</b> (Maller & Reiss, 1992; Olatunji & Woitzky-Taylor, 2009; Taylor, Koch, Woody, & McLean, 1996); however, limited research has examined the three facets of AS and how they relate to specific <b>anxiety</b> disorders <b>and</b> <b>depression.</b> The present study examined three specific anxiety symptom clusters (panic, generalized <b>anxiety,</b> <b>and</b> social <b>anxiety)</b> <b>and</b> depressive symptoms and their relationship with the three facets of AS (fear of physical symptoms, social concerns, and fear of cognitive dyscontrol). It was found that the fear of physical symptoms component of AS was correlated with panic, as was hypothesized, but also correlated with social <b>anxiety</b> symptoms <b>and</b> generalized <b>anxiety</b> symptoms. Consistent with hypotheses, fear of publicly observable symptoms, or the social concerns component of AS, was correlated with only one cluster of symptoms, social anxiety. Lastly, fear of cognitive dyscontrol was unexpectedly found to correlate with panic and symptoms of social anxiety; however, it did not correlate with generalized anxiety or depressive symptoms as predicted in the hypothesis. These results, although preliminary, suggest a degree of specificity with respect to how the various components of AS correlate with specific <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> mood symptoms. Future work in this area might be useful in preventative efforts to address aspects of AS that serve as specific risk factors for these disorders...|$|R
