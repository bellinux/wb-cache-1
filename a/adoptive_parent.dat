5|$|Canadian {{citizenship}} is typically obtained by birth in Canada or by birth or adoption abroad when {{at least one}} biological parent or <b>adoptive</b> <b>parent</b> is a Canadian citizen {{who was born in}} Canada or naturalized in Canada (and did not receive citizenship by being born outside of Canada to a Canadian citizen). It can also be granted to a permanent resident who lives in Canada for three out of four years and meets specific requirements. Canada established its own nationality law in 1946, with the enactment of the Canadian Citizenship Act which took effect on January 1, 1947. The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act was passed by the Parliament of Canada in 2001 as Bill C-11, which replaced the Immigration Act of 1976 as the primary federal legislation regulating immigration. Prior to the conferring of legal status on Canadian citizenship, Canada's naturalization laws consisted of a multitude of Acts beginning with the Immigration Act of 1910.|$|E

25|$|Cohabitating {{partners}} have no parental rights over {{the children of}} the other partner. It is possible, however, for one partner to legally adopt the other’s biological children. The <b>adoptive</b> <b>parent</b> must not be legally incapacitated, must not have been stripped of his or her parental rights by the courts, and must be at least 16 years older than the adopted child. It is not possible for co-habitating couples to adopt orphans, since the law requires adoptive couples to be married.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year in August 2003, there were concerns raised over {{the custody of}} Karyn's son Christopher, who had been adopted by Mary Slover, Karyn's ex-sister-in-law. Authorities argued that Mary had {{been aware of the}} murder and could have potentially helped in concealing the crime. A judge later ruled that Mary was unfit as an <b>adoptive</b> <b>parent</b> and that she should not retain custody. Mary contested the ruling, which she claimed influenced a case worker to change her report, which initially contained a recommendation that Christopher be returned to Mary. Despite this, Mary officially lost custody of Christopher in October 2003.|$|E

40|$|Adoption {{challenges}} the traditional Western notions of kinship and family formation. Because of this, adoption {{has become a}} stigmatized status in American culture. Utilizing a grounded theoretical approach, this study examines the experiences of stigma by <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> in the United States and the ways <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> react to and manage this stigmatization. Qualitative {{interviews were conducted with}} a diverse sample of 17 <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> living across the country. It was found that <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> experienced stigma through comments made during their interactions with others, which fell into four categories: hesitation toward the birth parents, suspicion of the costs, assumptions concerning adoptive parents’ motives, and reservations questioning the validity of adoption. In reaction, <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> engaged in stigma management strategies to resist and redefine cultural beliefs about adoptive families. They should to educate society on the realities of adoption by being open with their stories while challenging the assumptions and language of these experiences in hopes of normalizing adoption in America...|$|R

2500|$|GLaDOS' mocking of Chell was {{met with}} {{negative}} reception from Neal Stapel, an <b>adoptive</b> <b>parent</b> profiled by 1UP.com. He stated that [...] "it literally pokes fun for not having parents", and stopped playing when he first heard the insult. He added that [...] "it throws the ultimate question that that child {{is ever going to}} have for you... and it just throws it right in the living room." [...] Kotaku's Michael McWhertor felt that while it was [...] "awkward" [...] for the parents, the fact that GLaDOS was trying to kill Chell would be more upsetting. He also pointed out that [...] "morons and the overweight are also mocked by robots" [...] in Portal 2. 1UP.com's Chris Pereira found the joke [...] "harmless".|$|E
2500|$|There are {{problems}} with this interpretation, however. [...] The chariot {{is not one of}} victory. [...] It would be unusual for a two-horse chariot to be used for the triumph. [...] Also, Tiberius wears the toga. [...] The toga represents civility and peace, not war. [...] Perhaps {{this is a way to}} hand the victory to Augustus’ auguries. [...] Tiberius steps down from the chariot, doing obeisance to Augustus, giving his <b>adoptive</b> <b>parent</b> the triumph and victory. [...] If all this is true, then figure #8 could still be one of two persons, Drusus or Germanicus. [...] By this age, Drusus was probably already dead, having fallen from his horse and suffered irreparable injuries. [...] It could be, then, a representation of Drusus, and his memory, since he was fondly regarded by almost all. [...] Since he is clad in fighting garb, the helmet probably beside him under the chariot, and coincidentally standing next to a horse, this could very well be Drusus. [...] In addition, there are three constellations relating to the three portraits. [...] Drusus would claim Gemini, though the Gemini is quite covert. [...] If the portrait represented Drusus as alive, however, the gem would have been made about the same time as the Ara Pacis and the Altar of Augustus, sometime before 9 B.C., the year of Drusus’ death.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses data on adopted {{children}} {{to examine the}} relative importance of biology and environment in determining educational and labor market outcomes. I employ three long-term panel data sets which contain information on {{adopted children}}, their <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents,</b> and their biological parents. In {{at least two of the}} three data sets, the mechanism for assigning children to <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> is fairly random and does not match children to <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> based on health, race, or ability. I find that adoptive parents' education and income have a modest impact on child test scores but a large impact on college attendance, marital status, and earnings. In contrast with existing work on IQ scores, I do not find that the influence of <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> declines with child age. ...|$|R
50|$|Independent {{adoption}} is slightly different {{and a bit}} less bureaucratic. It is not required that the <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> have a pre-placement home study (unless the {{adoption is}} interstate). The {{theory is that the}} birth mother is directly selecting the <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents,</b> rather than relinquishing that decision to an agency. The birth mother (and sometimes the birth father) personally select the <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents,</b> usually by being shown photo-resumes of waiting <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents,</b> then meeting some families in person to select the chosen family. As with agency adoption, a six-month home study follows. In most counties, the home study is done by the California Department of Social Services. In some counties, however, a county office performs the service. Regardless, the home study fee is the same (see below).|$|R

The 2005 article said that <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> were no longer trying to cut ties with the culture of their adopted kid's birth country as of 2005, and <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> were instead trying to {{introduce}} their adopted kid {{to the culture of}} their birth country.

50|$|Many birth {{mothers do}} more than just meet the <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> once before the birth. If they live close enough to each other it is not {{uncommon}} for the birth mother to invite the adoptive mother (or adoptive father too if the birth mother wishes) to come to her doctor appointments. This lets the birth mother see the <b>adoptive</b> <b>parent's</b> joy and anticipation of soon becoming a parent, and allows all parties to the adoption a chance to bond. The same is true at the hospital, where it is not unusual for the <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> to be present for the delivery if that is the birth mother's wish. Many birth mothers ask the hospital staff to hand the baby to the <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> first so they can be the first people to hold their child, before she has even done so.|$|R
