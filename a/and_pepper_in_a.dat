40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) - University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2009. Potato virus Y (PVY) is an {{economically}} important virus worldwide. In South Africa, PVY {{has been shown}} to be a major limiting factor in the production of important solanaceous crops, including potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) and tobacco (Nicotiana spp). The variability that PVY displays, wherever the virus occurs, merits the study of the isolates occurring in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) in the Republic of South Africa (RSA). This characterization will provide a clear understanding of strains/isolates from local vegetables and how they relate to the other PVY strains already identified, as well as information that can be used to manage the diseases they cause. Hence, the aim of this project was to study the biological and genetic properties of PVY isolates infecting potato, tomato and pepper in KZN. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using monoclonal antibodies and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using primers specific to all PVY strains were used to detect the virus in plant material showing PVY-like symptoms collected from various locations in KZN. A total of 39 isolates (18 isolates infecting tomato, 12 infecting potato and 9 infecting pepper) were further differentiated into strains by means of ELISA using strain specific antibodies and RT-PCR using primers specific to the different strains of PVY identified around the world. All PVY isolates infecting tomato and pepper tested positive for the ordinary PVYO strain with both ELISA and RT-PCR. PVY isolates infecting potato were more diverse and comprised the PVYN, PVYNTN and PVYNWilga strains, with mixed infections noted in some cases. The biological properties were studied by mechanically inoculating Chenopodium quinoa, Nicotiana tabacum cv Xanthi, N. tabacum cv Samsun, N. glutinosa, and N. rustica with leaf extracts from plants infected with the different PVY strains detected in this study. All inoculated C. quinoa plants did not show symptoms. All tobacco plants showing symptoms were tested for the presence of PVY by means of ELISA using monoclonal antibodies targeting all strains and electron microscopy using the leaf dip technique. Not all the inoculated tobacco tested positive with ELISA. The symptoms observed were therefore divided into PVY-related and PVY non- related. PVY-related symptoms included vein clearing, mosaic chlorosis, stunting, and vein necrosis. PVY non-related symptoms included wrinkles and leaf distortions. Potyvirus-like particles of about 700 nm were observed under the transmission electron microscope (TEM) from plants showing PVY-related symptoms while rod shaped viral particles of sizes varying between 70 and 400 nm were observed from plants showing non-PVY related symptoms. A portion of the virus genome (1067 bp) covering part of the coat protein gene and the 3 ’ non-translated region (NTR) of three PVYO isolates infecting tomato, one PVYO isolate infecting pepper and one PVYNWilga isolate infecting potato were amplified, cloned and sequenced. The 5 ’ NTR, P 1, HC-Pro and part of P 3 regions (2559 bp) of a PVYN isolate infecting potato were also amplified, cloned and sequenced. Sequence data was compared with selected PVY sequences from different geographical locations around the world. These were available on the NCBI website and subsequently used for phylogenic analyses. The sequenced genomic regions of the PVYN isolate were found to be 99 % similar to the New Zealand PVYN isolate (GenBank accession number: AM 268435), the Swiss PVYN isolate CH 605 (X 97895) and the American PVYN isolate Mont (AY 884983). Moreover, the deduced amino acid sequence comparison of the genomic regions of the PVYN isolate revealed the presence of five distinct amino acids residues. The three amino acid residues (D 205, K 400, and E 419), which determine the vein necrosis phenotype in tobacco, were also identified. The coat protein and 3 ’ NTR sequences of all KZN PVYO isolates infecting pepper and tomato were closely similar to each other than to KZN PVYNWilga isolate infecting potato. The phylogenic analysis clustered the KZN PVYN isolate with the European sublineage N, PVYNWilga isolate infecting potato with the American PVYO isolate Oz (EF 026074) in the O lineage and all PVYO isolates infecting tomato <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> new sublineage within the O lineage. Taken together, these results point to the presence of PVY in solanaceous vegetables cultivated in KZN and they lay the foundation for the formulation of effective control measure against PVY diseases in KZN...|$|E

40|$|With rising {{electricity}} prices, forecasting {{water demand}} {{has become an}} essential part of the success of any water utility. Numerous forecasting methods have been suggested, but none have been able to characterize the unique consumer mixes that exist for every utility.

40|$|Beginning in 1997, {{international}} {{prices for}} black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) boomed {{for about three}} years, coinciding with the Asian economic crisis. Smallholders throughout Southeast Asia responded to the price rises by investing more labor into existing pepper gardens as well as planting new gardens.

Here we compare the response of Iban pepper smallholders to this situation {{on either side of the}} international border separating Sarawak, Malaysia and West Kalimantan, Indonesia. On both sides, Iban benefited from the higher prices, but many households without productive vines at the onset of high prices were too late as their new gardens had hardly matured before prices fell in 2000. In the study communities, the Iban Kalimantan significantly reduced their labor migration to focus on pepper during the period of high prices, whereas the Sarawak Iban relied on rather specific off-farm income sources in the tourism, off-shore oil and gas industries, and did not significantly alter their pepper cultivation strategies.

40|$|Greenhouse {{production}} in North-West Europe consumes {{a lot of}} energy. The energy is needed for heating the greenhouse and controlling air humidity. Transpiration of a crop increases the energy use. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the possibilities for the application of anti-transpirants to save energy by reducing crop transpiration without reducing crop yield. Literature and model calculations were used to explore the effects of increased leaf resistances on transpiration, energy use and {{production in}} tomato, cucumber <b>and</b> sweet <b>pepper.</b> <b>In</b> literature <b>a</b> large number of compounds are described that act as anti-transpirant. A two to five fold increase in stomatal resistance can be expected from treatment with anti-transpirants. Model calculations for tomato showed that increasing the stomatal resistance (from 2 to 5 times) throughout the whole year leads to substantial yield reduction: crop growth was reduced by 6 - 19 %, while transpiration by 15 - 42 % and consequently energy use by 9 - 16 %. However, in the winter period (beginning of October/end of March) the growth reduction was only 0. 3 - 1. 3 %, as in this period light levels are low and CO 2 concentrations in the greenhouse are relatively high. Raising the (maximum) set-point for CO 2 concentration from 1000 ppm to 3000 ppm, increased the actual concentration during day-time from 892 to 1567 ppm (flue gases were the only source of CO 2). When the application of anti-transpirants was combined with raising the set-point for CO 2 concentration, the model showed no growth reduction due to the application of anti-transpirants, while the annual energy use was reduced by 5. 5 - 10. 4 % in tomato. Similar results were obtained for sweet pepper (5 - 9 % energy saving) and cucumber (2 - 5 % energy saving). These model calculations show that increasing stomatal resistance by anti-transpirants during the winter period may potentially save a substantial amount of energy (2 - 10 %), without affecting yield of vegetables such as tomato, cucumber <b>and</b> sweet <b>pepper.</b> It is concluded that increasing the stomatal resistance by anti-transpirants in wintertime may lead to substantial energy saving due to the reduced transpiration and need for humidity management, without yield reduction. Such model calculations are useful to analyse beforehand the chances of a good combination of energy saving and yield loss of a possible application. Experiments will be needed to verify the result...|$|R
