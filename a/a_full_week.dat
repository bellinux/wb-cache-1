Red and White Day {{eventually became}} <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>week</b> of school spirit related activities preceding the annual Male-Manual football game. Two {{traditions of the}} sexually segregated past, sororities and the all-male Mitre Club, persisted into the 1950s as unofficial organizations but gradually faded away. Students began publishing a newspaper, The Crimson Record, in 1955.|$|E
5|$|The {{area where}} Armenia lies is of {{interest}} to seismologists and geologists because of the relatively early stage of continental collision occurring there and because the earthquake's strong aftershock sequence and significant surface faulting presented scientists with an environment to study reverse faulting. Twelve days after the mainshock a French-Soviet team installed a temporary seismic network in the epicentral area to record aftershock activity (a separate expedition from the United States also visited the site). The initial portion of work included nearly <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>week</b> setting up the seismometers and optimizing their operation and, with that complete, two full weeks of continuous operation was then completed with twenty six seismometers covering an area over 1500 square kilometers. The final stage concluded with seven weeks (through the end of February 1989) of continued monitoring with a reduced capacity of twenty units.|$|E
5|$|Throughout September10, Fred {{maintained}} Category 2 status before weakening to a Category 1 hurricane. Continued weakening {{took place}} on September11 as convection became fully disorganized. Later that day, Fred weakened to a tropical storm and by September12, no convection remained around {{the center of the}} former hurricane, leaving an exposed low-level circulation. The storm degenerated into a remnant-low later that day, corresponding with the final advisory from the National Hurricane Center (NHC). The remnants of Fred persisted for nearly <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>week,</b> traveling west-northwest across the Atlantic basin. The remnants finally dissipated on September19. Prior to becoming a tropical depression, the precursor to Fred produced moderate to heavy rainfall in the southern Cape Verde Islands, leading to two flight cancellations and several delays.|$|E

25|$|Up {{until the}} Ottoman {{withdrawal}} became apparent on 7 November, the Royal Flying Corps had mainly {{been involved in}} strategical reconnaissance by the 40th (Army) Wing, while the 5th (Corps) Wing had been undertaking artillery registration and tactical photography.

During the pursuit No. 1 Australian Flying Squadron, carried out the photographic work, taking detailed photos {{of the country and}} the position of the enemy immediately ahead, and took part in air raids. For <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>week,</b> they attacked the Ottoman columns with machine guns and bombs, as well as Ottoman infrastructure including aerodromes, transport and artillery, hitting many of their targets.|$|E
25|$|After the {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08, a number of banks were rescued from collapse by the United Kingdom government. The Banking Act 2009 was passed to improve protection for holders of banknotes issued by the authorised banks, so that the notes {{would have the same}} level of guaranteed value to that of Bank of England notes. Critics of the 2009 Act expressed concerns that it would restrict the issue of banknotes by commercial banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland by removing many of the provisions of the earlier Acts quoted above. Under the original proposals, banks would have been forced to lodge sterling funds with the Bank of England to cover private note issue for <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>week,</b> rather than over a weekend, thereby losing four days' interest and making banknote production financially unviable. Following negotiations among the UK Treasury, the Bank of England and the Scottish banks, it was agreed that the funds would earn interest, allowing them to continue to issue their own notes.|$|E

Fox would not air <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>week's</b> worth of programming until September 1993, so like most early Fox affiliates, WJPR was still programmed as an independent. Both stations suffered from the tight and increasingly fierce competition. However, by 1990, WVFT's financial problems were more pronounced; the station suffered from declining viewership and was unable to pay for the rights to acquire stronger syndicated programming.|$|R
25|$|Evans {{never allowed}} heroin to {{interfere}} with his musical discipline, according to a BBC record review article which contrasts Evans' addiction with that of Chet Baker. On one occasion while injecting heroin, he hit a nerve and temporarily disabled it, performing <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>week's</b> engagement at the Village Vanguard virtually one-handed. During this time, Helen Keane began having an important influence, as she significantly helped to maintain the progress of Evans' career {{in spite of his}} self-destructive lifestyle, and the two developed a strong relationship.|$|R
25|$|The {{recovery}} of bodies was slow. Spanish law required that, {{in order to}} avoid the spread of disease, bodies be buried within 24 hours and remain buried for at least five years. Three bodies were caught in the wreckage at the surface. But no one noticed them until February 23 (<b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>week</b> after the explosion), and by then vultures had devoured much of the corpses. Although only 19 corpses had been found, the city of Havana held a funeral for the dead. Thousands of people turned out for the funeral cortege and watched as the Spanish military bore the 19 elaborate coffins with great ceremony through the streets to Colon Cemetery, Havana. Another 135 bodies were recovered on February 19. The New York Times reported that this included the limbs of about 10 men. Twenty-four of them were identifiable. Two of the eight wounded (including Coxswain Alfred J. Holland) died that day as well.|$|E
25|$|Rosecrans {{ordered his}} army {{to move on}} August 16. The {{difficult}} road conditions meant <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>week</b> passed before they reached the Tennessee River Valley. They encamped while engineers made preparations for crossing the river. Meanwhile, Rosecrans's deception plan was underway. Col. John T. Wilder of the XIV Corps moved his mounted infantry brigade (the Lightning Brigade, which first saw prominence at Hoover's Gap) {{to the north of}} Chattanooga. His men pounded on tubs and sawed boards, sending pieces of wood downstream, to make the Confederates think that rafts were being constructed for a crossing north of the city. His artillery, commanded by Capt. Eli Lilly, bombarded the city from Stringer's Ridge for two weeks, an operation sometimes known as the Second Battle of Chattanooga. The deception worked and Bragg was convinced that the Union crossing would be above the city, in conjunction with Burnside's advancing Army of the Ohio from Knoxville.|$|E
25|$|Lyon {{returned}} from the winter break taking on Lorient. Despite getting an early goal from Ederson, Lyon failed to get a winning result leaving the match with a 1–1 draw. The following week, they rebounded with a 2–0 victory over Grenoble with Ederson getting on the scoreboard for the second-straight week. Due to Lyon's cup matches being postponed, {{they were forced to}} endure two cup matches in a span of four days before facing rivals Saint-Étienne. The match ended in another 1–1 draw. After <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>week</b> of training, Lyon again rebounded from a draw picking up a convincing 3–1 victory over Hugo Lloris' former club Nice, with Jean Makoun scoring an unexpected brace. This match also marked the league debut of youth product Yannis Tafer. The following week, they picked up another convincing 3–1 win, this time against Le Havre, with Makoun scoring again. This match also marked Lyon's third-straight match where a red card was given. The following week, Lyon again earned a victory, defeating Nancy 2–0. Lyon started the match without the majority of their regulars who were being rested for the first leg of their Champion's League showdown with Barcelona.|$|E

500|$|Construction of the {{remaining}} phases between US131 and M-37 and between I-196 and US131 was started on April 1, 2002.

The last major project for the freeway was to replace bridge beams in the overpasses from westbound I-196 to eastbound M-6. Design flaws were found in 2002 {{in the size of the}} beams in the bridges over eastbound I-196 and the ramp from westbound M-6 to westbound I-196. The replacement was originally supposed to close traffic along I-196 over a weekend in 2004, but kept a lane closed for <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>week,</b> backing up traffic on the Interstate for completion of the work was delayed when human error caused a shortage of nuts and bolts.|$|E
