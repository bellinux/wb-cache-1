5|$|This angular scaling {{can be seen}} in the apsidal precession, i.e., in {{the gradual}} {{rotation}} of the long axis of the ellipse (Figure3). As noted above, the orbit as a whole rotates with a mean <b>angular</b> <b>speed</b> Ω=(k−1)ω, where ω equals the mean <b>angular</b> <b>speed</b> of the particle about the stationary ellipse. If the particle requires a time T to move from one apse to the other, this implies that, in the same time, the long axis will rotate by an angle β=ΩT=(k−1)ωT=(k−1)×180°. For an inverse-square law such as Newton's law of universal gravitation, where n equals 1, there is no angular scaling (k=1), the apsidal angle α is 180°, and the elliptical orbit is stationary (Ω=β=0).|$|E
5|$|Newton's theorem of {{revolving}} orbits was {{his first}} attempt to understand apsidal precession quantitatively. According to this theorem, {{the addition of a}} particular type of central force—the inverse-cube force—can produce a rotating orbit; the <b>angular</b> <b>speed</b> is multiplied by a factor k, whereas the radial motion is left unchanged. However, this theorem is restricted to a specific type of force that may not be relevant; several perturbing inverse-square interactions (such as those of other planets) seem unlikely to sum exactly to an inverse-cube force. To make his theorem applicable to other types of forces, Newton found the best approximation of an arbitrary central force F(r) to an inverse-cube potential in the limit of nearly circular orbits, that is, elliptical orbits of low eccentricity, as is indeed true for most orbits in the Solar System. To find this approximation, Newton developed an infinite series that can be viewed as the forerunner of the Taylor expansion. This approximation allowed Newton to estimate the rate of precession for arbitrary central forces. Newton applied this approximation to test models of the force causing the apsidal precession of the Moon's orbit. However, the problem of the Moon's motion is dauntingly complex, and Newton never published an accurate gravitational model of the Moon's apsidal precession. After a more accurate model by Clairaut in 1747, analytical models of the Moon's motion were developed in the late 19th century by Hill, Brown, and Delaunay.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Evaluation of fuel {{consumption}} in internal combustion engines (ICE) of agricultural {{machinery and equipment}} is important in determining the performance under various operating conditions, especially when using biofuels. This study consisted of experimental evaluation of the gasoline (petrol) /ethanol consumption in a two-stroke 1 -cylinder ICE, Otto cycle, functioning as an air blower for agriculture and related applications. A methodology for tests of non-automotive ICE, based on ABNT/NBR technical standards, was considered. The presented results refer to operation with commercial and non-commercial fuel blends.

If the ball has a rough surface, the fluid flowing past it will make it rotate.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} an experimental framework {{to describe the}} dynamic behavior of brushless direct current (BLDC) motors, which are frequently used in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications. Typically these applications require varying the <b>angular</b> <b>speeds</b> of motors which have to be precise parts of the dynamic model. The experimental setup is a motor/propeller pair equipped with an electronic speed controller. The substantial contribution of the paper is to incorporate the voltage drop caused by the consumed power and the alleviation of the modulation effect on the measured battery voltage. The consequence of the voltage drop is to obtain different <b>angular</b> <b>speeds</b> under same excitation inputs. A Neural Network (NN) based approach is chosen to handle this modeling issue.

25|$|Helical {{symmetry}} is {{the kind}} of symmetry seen in such everyday objects as springs, Slinky toys, drill bits, and augers. The concept of helical symmetry can be visualized as the tracing in three-dimensional space that results from rotating an object at a constant <b>angular</b> <b>speed</b> while simultaneously translating at a constant linear speed along its axis of rotation. At any one point in time, these two motions combine to give a coiling angle that helps define the properties of the traced helix. When the tracing object rotates quickly and translates slowly, the coiling angle will be close to 0°. Conversely, if the rotation is slow and the translation is speedy, the coiling angle will approach 90°.|$|E
25|$|For an Earthbound observer, {{objects in}} the sky {{complete}} one revolution around the Earth in 1 day. Proxima Centauri, which is the nearest star outside the solar system, is about 4 light-years away. On a geostationary view, Proxima Centauri has a speed many times greater than c as the rim speed of an object moving in a circle {{is a product of}} the radius and <b>angular</b> <b>speed.</b> It is also possible on a geostatic view for objects such as comets to vary their speed from subluminal to superluminal and vice versa simply because the distance from the Earth varies. Comets may have orbits which take them out to more than 1000 AU. The circumference of a circle with a radius of 1000 AU is greater than one light day. In other words, a comet at such a distance is superluminal in a geostatic, and therefore non-inertial, frame.|$|E
25|$|In practice, this {{relationship}} {{can be observed}} in bicycles: Bicycles are typically composed of two road wheels, front and rear gears (referred to as sprockets) meshing with a circular chain, and a derailleur mechanism if the bicycle's transmission system allows multiple gear ratios to be used (i.e. multi-speed bicycle), all of which attached to the frame. A cyclist, the person who rides the bicycle, provides the input power by turning pedals, thereby cranking the front sprocket (commonly referred to as chainring). The input power provided by the cyclist is equal to the product of cadence (i.e. the number of pedal revolutions per minute) and the torque on spindle of the bicycle's crankset. The bicycle's drivetrain transmits the input power to the road wheel, which in turn conveys the received power to the road as the output power of the bicycle. Depending on the gear ratio of the bicycle, a (torque, rpm)input pair is converted to a (torque, rpm)output pair. By using a larger rear gear, or by switching to a lower gear in multi-speed bicycles, <b>angular</b> <b>speed</b> of the road wheels is decreased while the torque is increased, product of which (i.e. power) does not change.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes an {{alternative}} approach {{to address the problem}} of coordinating behaviors in mobile robot navigation: fusion of control signals. Such approach is based on a set of two decentralized information filters, which accomplish the data fusion involved. Besides these two fusion engines, control architectures designed according to this approach also embed a set of different controllers that generate reference signals for the robot linear and <b>angular</b> <b>speeds.</b> Such signals are delivered to the two decentralized information filters, which estimate suitable overall reference signals for the robot linear and <b>angular</b> <b>speeds,</b> respectively. Thus, the background for designing such control architectures is provided by the nonlinear systems theory, which makes this approach different from any other yet proposed. This background also allows checking control architectures designed according to the proposed approach for stability. Such analysis is carried out in the paper, and shows that the robot always reaches its final destination, in spite of either obstacles along its path or the environment layout. As an example, a control architecture is designed to guide a mobile robot in an experiment, whose results allows checking the good performance of the control architecture and validating the design approach proposed as well.
