Methods: Data on all individuals in Norway aged 20 - 39 years being prescribed anti-diabetic (n= 5 055), migraine (n= 26 058) and/or antidepressant agents (n= 57 424) in 2006 was obtained from the Norwegian Prescription Database and analysed in a cross-sectional design using logistic regression.

Descriptive statistics of antidiabetic medication use and variables such as age, gender, fasting blood glucose, HbA 1 C, presence of hypertension, duration of diabetes, blood pressure, BMI and number of antihypertensive medications were assessed. ANCOVA analyses to identify any differences in glycemic control among those taking different categories of <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>agents</b> were also done. ^ Results: Only 21. 8 % of the study population had adequate glycemic control. About {{a third of the}} population used 2 antidiabetic medications. Almost a quarter of the study participants were taking combination therapy when compared to 14 % in the general population. The level of glycemic control was worse among those taking a combination of oral <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>agents</b> and insulin. Results from ANCOVA analyses showed that there is a statistically significant difference in the mean levels of glycemic control among those taking different categories of <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>agents.</b> A wide array of antidiabetic medication combinations were utilized in the study population. ^ Conclusions: The antidiabetic medications used were comparable to those used in the general population though the population under study had poorer glycemic control than the general population. There are also differences in the level of glycemic control achieved with the different <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>agents.</b> Increased utilization of metformin with a non sulfonylurea oral medication or an insulin rather than just metformin and sulfonylurea combination should be warranted in the population to achieve better control of hyperglycemia.

Results: Both groups had a statistically significant improvement in visual acuity (oral <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>agents</b> group: 20 / 61 to 20 / 49, p= 0. 003; insulin therapy group: 20 / 76 to 20 / 56, p= 0. 005).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} if nonadherence with antidiabetic drug therapy is predictive of subsequent antidiabetic drug therapy intensification. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study examining retail pharmacy dispensings of sulfonylureas or metformin to 1067 patients having diabetes. Patients {{that did not}} receive a sufficient quantity of medication to cover at least 80 % of days during the evaluation period were classified as nonadherent. Outcomes identified were increase in the dose of antidiabetic medication utilized, {{the addition of a}} second <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>agent</b> to the regimen or either. RESULTS: Among users of sulfonylurea monotherapy, those classified as nonadherent were 45 % more likely to intensify therapy in subsequent months as compared with those classified as adherent (age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1. 45; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 06 - 2. 00). This finding was largely driven by observed increases in dosage, which were more likely among patients classified as nonadherent (age-adjusted OR 1. 48, 95 %CI 1. 07 - 2. 05). Nonadherence was not found to be predictive of the subsequent addition of a second <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>agent</b> (OR 1. 02; 95 %CI 0. 64 - 1. 63).
