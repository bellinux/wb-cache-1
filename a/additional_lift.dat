5|$|Like other pterosaurs, Pteranodon {{probably}} {{took off}} from a standing, quadrupedal position. Using their long forelimbs for leverage, they would have vaulted themselves into the air in a rapid leap. Almost all of the energy would have been generated by the forelimbs. The upstroke of the wings would have occurred when the animal cleared the ground followed by a rapid down-stroke to generate <b>additional</b> <b>lift</b> and complete the launch into the air.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Westland made an {{unsuccessful}} unsolicited offer to the British Ministry of Defence, proposing an enhanced Merlin variant intended {{to satisfy the}} demand for <b>additional</b> <b>lift</b> capacity. An alternative measure was the acquisition of six AW101s from Denmark in 2007; designated Merlin HC3A, these {{were assigned to the}} RAF, allowing Merlins to be deployed in Afghanistan. The HC3A is used for training and not for frontline operations due to various configuration differences. In December 2007, a second Merlin squadron, No. 78 Squadron was formed at RAF Benson.|$|E
5|$|All swifts feed on insects {{caught in}} flight, and the Pacific swift has been {{recorded}} as consuming bees, wasps, termites, moths and flies. A Chinese study found that it caught {{a wide variety of}} insect prey and considered that most of the species eaten were harmful to agriculture or forestry. The Pacific swift tends to hunt higher than sympatric swifts, sharing its airspace mainly with white-throated needletails. It typically feeds at heights up to , only flying close to the ground in poor weather. It often forages near low-pressure areas, which serve both to raise insects from the ground and to give the swifts <b>additional</b> <b>lift.</b> The swifts circle through the insect swarms in flocks typically of tens or hundreds of birds, although sometimes reaching tens of thousands in Australia. In Siberia, Pacific swifts feed at dusk to much later hours than the common swift, sometimes until midnight, and migrants have been seen flying with bats in the Philippines. The young are brought balls of insects bound with saliva. In bad weather, they are sometimes not fed for days, surviving on stored body fat.|$|E

25|$|In the 1990s <b>additional</b> <b>lifts</b> for the {{mobility}} impaired were added from the District line platforms {{to a new}} overbridge which {{was connected to the}} high level walkway which joins the two station entrances.|$|R
50|$|The Sukhoi design, {{which was}} altered {{progressively}} to reflect Soviet {{awareness of the}} F-15's specifications, emerged as the T-10 (Sukhoi's 10th design), which first flew on 20 May 1977. The aircraft had a large wing, clipped, with two separate podded engines and a twin tail. The ‘tunnel’ between the two engines, as on the F-14 Tomcat, acts both as an <b>additional</b> <b>lifting</b> surface and hides armament from radar.|$|R
5|$|HSA {{formed an}} {{agreement}} with the German Focke-Wulf aircraft company to collaborate on a joint study that looked into the issue of equipping the P.1150 with two <b>additional</b> <b>lift</b> engines. However, in October 1961, West Germany elected to entirely withdraw from participation in the programme. This was a blow that was directly felt not only by HSA and the development team, but by the British Air Ministry, who had been also seeking to collaborate with its West German counterparts on the matter of VTOL aircraft. Meanwhile, further studies served to confirmed fears that the P.1150 would be too small to meet customer specifications, and thus Camm initiated work on an enlarged derivative design. In conjunction with HSA's redesign, Bristol worked to enlarge the original PCB engine and raised the exhaust heat to increase thrust to 146.8kN (30,000lbf). It could have theoretically reach speeds of up to Mach1.7–2.|$|E
5|$|Skilful use of {{headwind}} {{and thermal}} updrafts along various {{sections of the}} hill is used to generate <b>additional</b> <b>lift,</b> creating pressure under the oversized skis and enabling athletes to effectively ride on a 'cushion of air'. A reasonable amount of headwind is favourable to a long jump as it {{has the effect of}} keeping the athlete aloft and delaying their descent back onto the hill, whereas a tailwind or no wind at all is highly unfavourable and tends to shorten a jump by pushing the athlete downwards towards the hill too early. In particular, the presence of a tailwind forms one of the most challenging aspects of clearing the knoll and achieving a competitive distance. A crosswind is just as challenging, as it can create dangerous instability in the air. Conversely, in ideal headwind conditions, an athlete can 'catch' an updraft along various points of the hill – which always involves some degree of luck – and use it to glide even further, making for an impressive visual effect for audiences.|$|E
25|$|Its fixed {{undercarriage}} had mainwheels on a rigid axle, rubber {{sprung from}} the crosspiece between two tall V-form legs {{mounted on the}} fuselage at the same points as the interplane struts. The axle and crosspiece were enclosed within an airfoil section fairing, which provided some <b>additional</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|E
50|$|The U-Bahn {{platforms}} lie {{up to five}} storeys {{below the}} Stephansplatz. Station entrances {{are located in the}} square, in the Graben, in Kärntner Straße and in Goldschmiedegasse. To preserve the streetscape, they are not covered. The Goldschmiedegasse entrance is via a lift {{on the outside of the}} Haas-Haus and is wheelchair-accessible. The remaining entrances have escalators and stairs. There are a total of 23 escalators of varying lengths, and 3 <b>additional</b> <b>lifts</b> within the station.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} ramps for easy {{wheelchair}} access, three VIP/VVIP lifts, {{two in the}} West Stand {{and one in the}} East Stand, as well as four service lifts, two on the west and two on the east of the stadium. Four <b>additional</b> <b>lifts</b> are planned for the legacy phase. There are 32 turnstiles and colour-coded gates on level 2 for spectators to access their seats and four ramps leading up from level 2 to level 5.|$|R
50|$|With the <b>additional</b> <b>lifting</b> {{capability}} {{presented by}} the Space Shuttle program, NASA designers were {{able to create a}} more comprehensive medical readiness kit. The SOMS consists of two separate packages: the Medications and Bandage Kit (MBK) and the Emergency Medical Kit (EMK). While the MBK contained capsulate medications (tablets, capsules, and suppositories), bandage materials, and topical medication, the EMK had medications to be administered by injection, items for performing minor surgeries, diagnostic/therapeutic items, and a microbiological test kit.|$|R
25|$|Most {{efficient}} glider. This can {{be taken}} as the animal that moves most horizontal distance per metre fallen. Flying squirrels are known to glide up to , but have measured glide ratio of about 2. Flying fish have been observed to glide for hundreds of metres on the drafts {{on the edge of}} waves with only their initial leap from the water to provide height, but may be obtaining <b>additional</b> <b>lift</b> from wave motion. On the other hand, albatrosses have measured lift/drag ratios of 20, and thus fall just 1 meter (foot) for every 20 in still air.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, Vought {{engineer}} Rex B. Beisel was tasked with designing an observation monoplane aircraft for the U.S. Navy {{suitable for a}} multitude of tasks including directing battleship fire. In replacing the standard biplane observation aircraft with a more modern monoplane design, Beisel incorporated innovations becoming the first production type to be assembled with spot welding, a process Vought and the Naval Aircraft Factory jointly developed to create a smooth fuselage that resisted buckling and generated less drag. Beisel also introduced high-lift devices, spoilers and in a unique arrangement, deflector plate flaps and drooping ailerons located on {{the trailing edge of}} the wing were deployed to increase the camber of the wing and thus create <b>additional</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|E
25|$|Early on, IAI {{decided to}} adopt a delta wing configuration, of which the company was already {{familiar}} with through its work on the earlier Kfir, which was paired with large, steerable canards situated forward of the wing. The delta wing arrangement was relatively low-weight, provided space for considerable fuel capacity, a smooth low-altitude fight attitude, {{and high levels of}} directional stability while flown at high angles of attack (AOA). The canard generated <b>additional</b> <b>lift</b> and positive control when at high AOAs. While this configuration afforded excellent maneuverability, it also exhibited natural instability during flight. To compensate, the Lavi was fitted with a sophisticated digital fly-by-wire system which allowed the aircraft {{to take advantage of this}} particular wing design while eliminating this shortcoming. The Lavi was one of the first aircraft to feature this type of configuration, which has since become more commonplace amongst fighter aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|The {{shoulder}} mounted wing {{was supported}} by sizeable lift struts attached to the landing gear, which featured an <b>additional</b> <b>lifting</b> area between the wheels. A section of wing root was cut away to improve downward visibility. The fuselage and wing were fabric covered. It was armed with two synchronized 7.7 mm Vickers machine guns.The first prototype made its first flight in early January 1918 while powered by a [...] Gnome Monosoupape 9N rotary engine, the same engine used in the Nieuport 28.|$|R
50|$|With a 48,000 t topside lift capacity, {{the vessel}} {{operates}} as a semi-submersible, ballasting to lower, and install the payload, or de-ballasting to raise and remove the payload. Topsides are lifted using eight sets of horizontal lifting beams. Two tilting lift beams for the installation or removal of steel jackets, up to 22,500 t in weight, will be located at the vessel’s stern. A 5000 t special purpose crane is available for <b>additional</b> <b>lifts</b> for jacket and topsides installation such as pile handling and bridge installation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{operation}} is extensive {{and is known}} for wound healing complications. Some surgeons have arbitrarily divided the operation into smaller portions to help limit these complications. Furthermore, the concept has been expanded upon to include <b>additional</b> <b>lifts</b> {{such as those of}} the inner thigh (medial thigh lift). The traditional lower body lift targeted the upper thighs as well as the buttocks and abdomen. For the large volume weight loss patient, this {{operation is}} ideal to remove the redundant skin that frequently [...] "hangs" [...] around the lower torso.|$|R
500|$|North American had {{scoured the}} {{literature}} {{to find any}} additional advantage. This led them to an obscure report by two NACA wind tunnel experts, who wrote a report in 1956 titled [...] "Aircraft Configurations Developing High Lift-Drag Ratios at High Supersonic Speeds". Known today as compression lift, {{the idea was to}} use the shock wave generated off the nose or other sharp points on the aircraft as a source of high-pressure air. By carefully positioning the wing in relation to the shock, the shock's high pressure could be captured {{on the bottom of the}} wing and generate <b>additional</b> <b>lift.</b> To take maximum advantage of this effect, they redesigned the underside of the aircraft to feature a large triangular intake area far forward of the engines, better positioning the shock in relation to the wing. The former individually podded engines were repositioned in a single large duct under the fuselage.|$|E
500|$|Aerodynamic {{studies in}} the 1960s {{demonstrated}} that the [...] "vortex lift" [...] phenomenon could be harnessed by highly swept wing configurations to reach higher angles of attack, using leading edge vortex flow off a slender lifting surface. As the F-16 was being optimized for high combat agility, GD's designers chose a slender cropped-delta wing with a leading edge sweep of 40° and a straight trailing edge. To improve maneuverability, a variable-camber wing with a NACA 64A-204 airfoil was selected; the camber is adjusted by leading-edge and trailing edge flaperons linked to a digital flight control system (FCS) regulating the flight envelope. The F-16 has a moderate wing loading, reduced by fuselage lift. The vortex lift effect is increased by leading edge extensions, known as strakes. Strakes act as additional short-span, triangular wings running from the wing root (the juncture with the fuselage) to a point further forward on the fuselage. Blended into the fuselage and along the wing root, the strake generates a high-speed vortex that remains attached {{to the top of}} the wing as the angle of attack increases, generating <b>additional</b> <b>lift</b> and allowing greater angles of attack without stalling. Strakes allow a smaller, lower-aspect-ratio wing, which increases roll rates and directional stability while decreasing weight. Deeper wingroots also increase structural strength and internal fuel volume.|$|E
2500|$|The Stipa-Caproni first flew on 7 October 1932 with Caproni company {{test pilot}} Domenico Antonini at the controls. Initial testing {{showed that the}} [...] "intubed propeller" [...] design did {{increase}} the engine's efficiency as Stipa had calculated, and the <b>additional</b> <b>lift</b> provided by the airfoil shape of {{the interior of the}} duct itself allowed a very low landing speed of only [...] and assisted the Stipa-Caproni in achieving a higher rate of climb than other aircraft with similar power and wing loading. The placement of the rudder and elevators in the exhaust from the propeller wash at the trailing edge of the tube gave the aircraft handling characteristics that made it very stable in flight, although they later were enlarged to further improve the plane's handling characteristics. The Stipa-Caproni proved to be noticeably quieter than conventional aircraft of the time. Unfortunately, the [...] "intubed propeller" [...] design also induced so much aerodynamic drag that the benefits in engine efficiency were cancelled out, and the aircraft's top speed proved to be only [...]|$|E

50|$|Boyne Resorts {{was founded}} by Everett Kircher, Jim Christianson and John Norton in 1947. They {{purchased}} a steep hill in Northern Michigan for $1 from former State Senator Pierson. Then the co-founders bought a single chairlift from Sun Valley and installed it at their Northern Michigan resort as its first lift. This chairlift was the first ever built. Still in service today, it has been upgraded several times. In 1954, Boyne built and opened the Gatlinburg Skylift in Tennessee as a summer tourist attraction. In 1963, Boyne Highlands in Northern Michigan was added and by 1967, Boyne Mountain expanded to include <b>additional</b> <b>lifts</b> and a golf course.
