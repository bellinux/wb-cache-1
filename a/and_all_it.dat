25|$|Filmage: The Story of Descendents/All is a 2013 {{independent}} {{documentary film}} chronicling {{the history of}} the American punk rock bands the Descendents <b>and</b> <b>All.</b> <b>It</b> was written by Matt Riggle, who produced and directed it with Deedle LaCour. The film uses an oral history format, telling the bands' stories through the use of interviews with over 40 subjects, as well as new and archival footage. It stars drummer Bill Stevenson, singer Milo Aukerman, bassist Karl Alvarez, and guitarist Stephen Egerton, and features nearly all past and present members of both bands. Filmage also features numerous musicians who were contemporaries of, worked with, or were influenced by the Descendents and All.|$|E
25|$|Bernini’s Neptune and Triton {{references}} the mythological {{characters of}} Neptune (or Poseidon) {{and his son}} Triton, the rulers of the seas. Neptune and Triton are deities that appear relatively briefly in classical literature; however, they are deemed important as controllers {{of the earth and}} seas. It is a common modern misconception to attribute Neptune to just the seas; however, in Greek myth Neptune is the ruler of earth <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> possesses, just as Zeus is the ruler of the heavens and Hades is the ruler of the Underworld. Triton is actually the character attributed to ruler of (just) the seas. Neptune and Triton are often depicted in water-like settings, holding tridents and usually driving chariots that have horses shooting out from the water.|$|E

Prisoners appeared as men who should indirectly use their experiences in order to be recognised as a result. The status of prisoner was not one that was proclaimed proudly.

25|$|The St. Anne's Market {{building}} was completely devastated. The fire consumed the parliament's two libraries, {{parts of the}} archives of Upper Canada and Lower Canada, {{as well as more}} recent public documents. Over 23,000 volumes, forming the collections of the two parliamentary libraries, were lost. Only about 200 books, along with the portrait of Queen Victoria, were saved, thanks to James Curran. Four people, Colonel Wiley, a Scotsman named McGillivray, an employee of the parliament, and the uncle of Todd, who was responsible for the libraries, and Sandford Fleming, who later became a renowned engineer, saved the portrait of Queen Victoria hanging in the hall leading to the lower house. The canvas of the painting without the frame was transported to the Donegana Hotel. The market buildings <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> contained were insured for £12,000; the insurers refused to pay because of the criminal origin of the fire.|$|E

[...] Simon retired from full-time television work, although still worked in the media, frequently contributing, as a writer and a participant, to Howard Stern's radio shows. He wrote and directed the one-off radio sitcom [...] "The Bitter Half" [...] for Stern's Howard 101 in 2006. Simon had his own show on Radioio.

500|$|As {{early as}} 1916, Tristan Tzara took {{distance}} from the Italian Futurists, rejecting the militarist and proto-fascist stance of their leader Filippo Tommaso Marinetti. Richter notes that, by then, Dada had replaced Futurism {{as the leader of}} modernism, while continuing to build on its influence: [...] "we had swallowed Futurism—bones, feathers <b>and</b> <b>all.</b> <b>It</b> is true that in the process of digestion all sorts of bones and feathers had been regurgitated." [...] Despite this and the fact that Dada did not make any gains in Italy, Tzara could count poets Giuseppe Ungaretti and Alberto Savinio, painters Gino Cantarelli and Aldo Fiozzi, as well as a few other Italian Futurists, among the Dadaists. Among the Italian authors supporting Dadaist manifestos and rallying with the Dada group was the poet, painter and in the future a fascist racial theorist Julius Evola, who became a personal friend of Tzara.|$|E

500|$|In {{writing the}} script, the Breaking Bad staff decided {{early on that}} Gus would not speak much during the scene because they felt it was more {{dramatic}} that way and more appropriate for his character. Esposito felt the scene was a pivotal moment not only for his character, but for Gus' relationship with Walter, and a warning that Walter should continue to operate Gus' way or risk death. Regarding his character's murder of Victor, Esposito said: [...] "This had to be done. Someone did something, they got seen. ... It was about survival. This had to be done, but I {{could do it in}} a way that also sent a message to the people who weren't listening." [...] Bryan Cranston said he was not expecting the episode to take the direction it did. He called the scene [...] "painful, but beautifully crafted, and reasonably so", and commented on the contrast between Gus' calm demeanor and Walter's [...] "tap-dancing to stay alive". Cranston said of Esposito's performance, [...] "When he plays that bad character, his eyes go dead, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> takes is to look into his eyes." [...] Gilligan said although Gus' actions in the scene were scripted, [...] "You'd be surprised how little I talked to Giancarlo about how he played that part ...

500|$|Sarah Graham {{wrote in}} Ariel, a journal {{published}} by the University of Calgary, that Eugenides' [...] "persisen" [...] {{use of the word}} [...] "hermaphrodite", instead of [...] "intersex", alludes to Hermaphroditus. Hermaphroditus, a young man, is chased by the nymph Salmacis. She begs the Gods to bind her and Hermaphroditus together, and the Gods literally fulfill her wish. Hermaphroditus' name is a compound of his parent's names—Hermes and Aphrodite. He instantaneously turns into someone of both sexes. Devastated because he is no longer fully male, he [...] "curses" [...] the location where he first met Salmacis. Graham stated that the use of [...] "hermaphrodite" [...] carries negative connotations: Based on this origin story, the hermaphrodite's lot is miserable, associated with disempowerment, the theft of identity and an unhappy dual existence. In addition, the term [...] "hermaphrodite" [...] may be deemed problematic because it alludes to an impossible state of being: no-one can be equally male and female and the preferred term [...] "intersex" [...] indicates a blended rather than divided state. While the modern term might indicate the possibility of redefining sexual ambivalence, Cal is associated in the novel with the mythic term <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> connotes. His connection to this tragic figure is confirmed by his performance as [...] "Hermaphroditus" [...] in a sex show at the age of fourteen, just as he is beginning his female to male transition.|$|E
500|$|Life Is Peachy {{opens with}} the forty-nine second prelude [...] "Twist", {{which is made}} up of improvised scat singing done by Davis. Doug Small {{described}} the singing as [...] "spitting out the twisted rantings of a madman", and said that it was fit for the album's introduction. An a cappella version of [...] "Twist" [...] is included as a hidden track after [...] "Kill You". [...] "Chi" [...] is named after former Deftones bassist Chi Cheng. Davis said that the song [...] "Chi" [...] is [...] "about a lot of alcohol and drug abuse". The song was named after Cheng for the sole reason that Cheng liked reggae and had taken it into his head that the song [...] "Chi" [...] was actually a reggae song. [...] "Swallow" [...] is about drug-induced paranoia. [...] "Mr. Rogers" [...] is about Fred Rogers. Davis said: [...] "As a kid, he told me to be polite, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> did was get me picked on. I fucking hate that man. Thanks for making me polite and trusting everyone, and easy to take advantage of." [...] "K@#Ø%!" [...] is about women who have hurt Davis. Munky said the band were going to send it to the radio as a joke because they [...] "knew they wouldn't play it, then follow up about a week later with the real thing". [...] "A.D.I.D.A.S." [...] is an Acronym for [...] "All Day I Dream About Sex". Davis explained the background behind [...] "Good God": [...] "Ass Itch" [...] is about Davis' difficulty with songwriting.

500|$|Upon its release, {{the video}} {{received}} universal acclaim from contemporary music critics. James Montgomery from MTV {{felt that the}} video [...] "is most definitely a massive thing, but it's a spiritual endeavor, too: a celebration of a band, their fans and an unyielding sense of purpose". He further commented, [...] "the message, it seems, is clear: There is might in masses, a freedom in unity and strength in conviction. <b>And</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> takes to harness any of it is will." [...] Montgomery also noticed that although the band's previous videos were more elaborate, [...] "Kings and Queens" [...] was [...] "no less of an epic undertaking". Joe Bosso of MusicRadar {{was impressed by the}} video and felt that [...] "the beautifully shot clip" [...] is a [...] "reverent nod" [...] to directors Akira Kurosawa and Walter Hill. He noted that its production values [...] "haven't been seen in music videos for quite some time". August Brown from the Los Angeles Times opined that with [...] "raging wildfires and white stallion" [...] that joins them, Thirty Seconds to Mars [...] "hasn't lost its taste for the epic". Tim Grierson from About.com felt that Los Angeles is featured in all its glory in the music video for [...] "Kings and Queens". Kyle Anderson from MTV believed that although the premise and approach of the music video is [...] "relatively simple" [...] and does not feature special effects, it is [...] "actually an incredibly cinematic, wholly satisfying experience". In 2013, Kerrang! magazine included [...] "Kings and Queens" [...] among the best music videos by Thirty Seconds to Mars, noting that [...] "the band never shy away from a challenge, making full use of frontman Jared Leto's Hollywood experience and delivering huge, concept-based short films." ...|$|E
2500|$|What we {{have here}} {{is an example of a}} [...] "fluctuation-dissipation elation". Generally {{speaking}} if a system is coupled to a bath that can take energy from the system in an effectively irreversible way, then the bath must also cause fluctuations. The fluctuations and the dissipation go hand in hand we cannot have one without the other. In the current example the coupling of a dipole oscillator to the electromagnetic field has a dissipative component, in the form of the zero-point (vacuum) field; given the existence of radiation reaction, the vacuum field must also exist in order to preserve the canonical commutation rule <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> entails.|$|E

ElBaradei later noted that these documents could not be shared because of the need to protect sources and methods, but noted that this allowed Iran to question their authenticity.
