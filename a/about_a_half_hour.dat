Her throat became so constricted that she stopped breathing {{and had to be}} resuscitated. She also suffered convulsive fits for several weeks after the attack, though local physician S.F. Driver recorded {{at the time that he}} believed this was most likely due to anxiety brought on by the attack, rather than the effects of the gas itself.|$|E

Together {{with most of the}} Japanese battleships, the division opened fire at 14:10 on the Russian battleship , which was forced to fall out of formation at 14:50 and sank 20 minutes later. After a failed torpedo attack was repulsed by Iwate and several other cruisers around the same time, the Russian battleship [...] suddenly appeared out of the mist at 15:35 at short range.

500|$|The {{high winds}} and heavy seas {{prevented}} {{the launching of}} any lifeboats and Davidson {{had decided not to}} abandon ship just yet in the faint hope that some passengers and crewmen might be able to swim ashore once the ship got closer. <b>About</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> after the collision, the British destroyer [...] appeared after searching for the convoy during the night. Despite Davidson's order to stand clear, Mounseys captain, Lieutenant Francis Craven, positioned his ship on Otrantos lee side to allow the men aboard the liner to jump aboard. Several times the two ships struck and the destroyer's hull was holed, her bridge smashed, two of three boiler rooms flooded, and many hull frames were broken by the force of the impacts. Nonetheless Craven kept his small ship close and was able to rescue 300 American troops, 266 officers and crewmen from Otranto, one YMCA morale officer and 30 French fishermen, although many more men had been washed from the decks or crushed between the two ships. Despite the weight of the rescued men and the damage sustained during the rescue, Mounsey was able to reach Belfast safely although she was too badly damaged to return to her own home port against the storm.|$|E

We had Tom Savini , we shot at the Monroeville Mall, it's as close to a zombie movie as I'll ever get." [...] In the film, Zack plays hockey, and his team's name is the Monroeville Zombies, which is another reference to the George A. Romero film.

Standing over him was his 12-year-old son; feet and arms bound, he had managed to hop from a back room of the house.

The police noted this type of killing was prevalent in the local underworld. John Hill was beaten and shot three times: in the chest, shoulder and right arm.|$|E
