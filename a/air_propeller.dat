5000|$|Dennistoun Burney was a {{naval officer}} who had become {{convinced}} of the possibilities of naval aviation and who {{had a number of}} technical ideas on the subject. Wanting to develop these but lacking the technical resources to do so, he approached Bristol who expressed an interest and, having been assured of support from the Admiralty, set up a highly secret separate design office, called the X Department, to develop these at the end of 1911. Frank Barnwell was hired to act as designer, with Clifford Tinson as his assistant. [...] Their first proposal, designated X.1 was an adaptation of a Bristol G.E. 1 biplane. [...] The aircraft was to be supported in the water by five streamlined airbags under the wings but for takeoff used the hydrofoil principle recently pioneered by Enrico Forlanini using three sets of hydrofoils, each consisting of a central leg bearing a stack of lifting planes, an assembly referred to as a [...] "hydroped".

50|$|Since the {{efficiency}} of propulsion {{is a function of}} the relative airspeed of the exhaust to the surrounding <b>air,</b> <b>propellers</b> are most efficient for low speed, pure jets for high speeds, and ducted fans in the middle.

Turbofans retain an efficiency edge over pure jets at low supersonic speeds up to roughly Mach 1.6.|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{focus on}} {{reduction}} of CO 2 emissions, {{and the possibility}} of future severe shortage of oil have sparked renewed interest in wind as supplementary propulsion of merchant ships. Several alternative solutions are considered, like kites, conventional soft sails, rigid sails, Flettner rotors, and wind turbines. A tempting aspect of wind turbine propulsion is that it can provide propulsive force when sailing directly upwind, something that is impossible with the other mentioned forms of wind-assisted propulsion. A method based on axial momentum theory has been outlined, in order to predict the steady-state speed of a wind turbine powered boat. This method is applied to a notional wind turbine powered catamaran. The predicted boat speed to wind speed ratio when the boat is sailing upwind is in good agreement with results from testing of a similar, but smaller, full-scale wind turbine boat. A related topic to wind turbine propulsion is the reversed configuration, where a water turbine is driving an <b>air</b> <b>propeller.</b> This configuration allows for the theoretical possibility of sailing faster than the wind, directly downwind. Based on a similar approach to the method of velocity prediction of wind turbine powered boats, design criteria with respect to water turbine efficiency and hydrofoil chord length, are set for a given hydrofoil boat in order to sail faster than the wind, directly downwind. The design of optimal wind turbine blades for wind turbine powered vessels is studied. A 326 m L WL VLCC is equipped with a Vestas V 90 wind turbine for auxiliary propulsion, and set to sail a route across the North Sea. By employing the wind turbine, 3. 6 % of the fuel is saved when the ship is sailing at 15 kn. If the ship speed is reduced to 10 kn, the fuel saving increases to 21. 1 %. The optimal blade design theory is applied to the wind turbine ship, keeping the wind turbine diameter fixed at 90 m. The optimal blade design increases the fuel saving by a few percentage points. The main drawbacks for a wind turbine powered ship are shown to be the low ship speed to wind speed ratio in order for wind turbine propulsion to be the preferred form of wind-assisted propulsion, as well as the height of such a ship. Attached is a CD-ROM containing Matlab files used for creating various of the results in this thesis, as well as an electronic version of the thesis. </p...|$|E

50|$|The twisted {{aerofoil}} {{shape of}} modern aircraft propellers was pioneered by the Wright brothers. While some earlier engineers {{had attempted to}} model <b>air</b> <b>propellers</b> on marine propellers, the Wrights realized that a propeller {{is essentially the same}} as a wing, and were able to use data from their earlier wind tunnel experiments on wings. They also introduced a twist {{along the length of the}} blades. This was necessary to ensure the angle of attack of the blades was kept relatively constant along their length. Their original propeller blades were only about 5% less efficient than the modern equivalent, some 100 years later. The understanding of low speed propeller aerodynamics was fairly complete by the 1920s, but later requirements to handle more power in smaller diameter have made the problem more complex.|$|R
40|$|The screw {{propeller}} on airplanes is usually placed near other objects, and hence its performance may be modified by them. Results of tests on propellers free from slip stream obstructions, both fore and aft, are therefore subject to correction, {{for the effect}} of such obstructions {{and the purpose of}} the investigation was to determine the effect upon the thrust and torque coefficients and efficiency, for previously tested <b>air</b> <b>propellers,</b> of obstructions placed in the slip stream, it being realized that such previous tests had been conducted under somewhat ideal conditions that are impracticable of realization in flight. Simple geometrical forms were used for the initial investigation. Such forms offered the advantage of easy, exact reproduction at another time or in other laboratories, and it was believed that the effects of obstructions usually encountered might be deduced or surmise from those chosen...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine the performance, characteristics, and coefficients of full-sized <b>air</b> <b>propellers</b> in flight and to compare these results with those derived from wind-tunnel tests on reduced scale models of similar geometrical form. The full-scale equipment comprised five propellers in combination with a VE- 7 airplane and Wright E- 4 engine. This part of the work was carried out at the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory, between May 1 and August 24, 1924, and was under the immediate charge of Mr. Lesley. The model or wind-tunnel part of the investigation was carried out at the Aerodynamic Laboratory of Stanford University and was under the immediate charge of Doctor Durand. A comparison of the curves for full-scale results with those derived from the model tests shows that while the efficiencies realized in flight are close to those derived from model tests, both thrust developed and power absorbed in flight are from 6 to 10 per cent greater than would be expected from the results of model tests...|$|R

500|$|In 1903 the {{brothers}} built the powered Wright Flyer I, using their preferred material for construction, spruce, {{a strong and}} lightweight wood, and Pride of the West muslin for surface coverings. They also designed and carved their own wooden propellers, and had a purpose-built gasoline engine fabricated in their bicycle shop. They thought propeller design would be a simple matter and intended to adapt data from shipbuilding. However, their library research disclosed no established formulae for either marine or <b>air</b> <b>propellers,</b> and they found themselves with no sure starting point. They discussed and argued the question, sometimes heatedly, until they concluded that an aeronautical propeller is essentially a wing rotating in the vertical plane. On that basis, they used data from more wind tunnel tests to design their propellers. The finished blades were just over eight feet long, made of three laminations of glued spruce. The Wrights decided on twin [...] "pusher" [...] propellers (counter-rotating to cancel torque), which would act on a greater quantity of air than a single relatively slow propeller and not disturb airflow over {{the leading edge of}} the wings.|$|R
5000|$|After his {{resignation}} {{from the army}} in 1891 at age 52, Zeppelin devoted his full attention to airships. He hired the engineer Theodor Gross to make tests of possible materials and to assess available engines for both fuel efficiency and power-to-weight ratio. He also had <b>air</b> <b>propellers</b> tested and strove to obtain higher purity hydrogen gas from suppliers. Zeppelin was so confident of his concept that in June 1891 he wrote to the King of Württemberg's secretary, announcing he was to start building, and shortly after requested a review from the Prussian Army's Chief of General Staff. The next day Zeppelin almost gave up as {{he realized he had}} underestimated air resistance, but resumed work on hearing that Rudolf Hans Bartsch von Sigsfeld made light but powerful engines, information soon shown to be overoptimistic. Whereupon Zeppelin urged his supporter Max von Duttenhofer to press Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft for more efficient engines so as not to fall behind the French. Duttenhofer wrote to Gross threatening to withdraw support, and Zeppelin shortly afterwards sacked Gross, citing Gross' lack of support and writing that he was [...] "an obstacle in my path".|$|R

In 1872 Dupuy de Lome launched a large navigable balloon, which {{was driven by}} a large propeller turned by eight men. Hiram Maxim built a craft that weighed 3.5 tons, with a 110-foot (34-meter) wingspan that was powered by two 360-horsepower (270-kW) steam engines driving two propellers. In 1894, his machine was tested with overhead rails {{to prevent it from}} rising. The test showed that it had enough lift to take off. One of Pénaud's toys, given as a gift by their father, inspired the Wright brothers to pursue the dream of flight. The twisted airfoil (aerofoil) shape of an aircraft propeller was pioneered by the Wright Brothers. While some earlier engineers had attempted to model <b>air</b> <b>propellers</b> on marine propellers, the Wright Brothers realized that a propeller is essentially the same as a wing, and were able to use data from their earlier wind tunnel experiments on wings, introducing a twist {{along the length of the}} blades.
