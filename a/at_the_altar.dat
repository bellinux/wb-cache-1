5|$|The Temple is {{surrounded}} by sites where villagers worship, generating the power needed to cast miracles. Villagers require feeding, healing or rest to worship.

Miracles can also be cast by using Miracle Dispensers, a common reward for completing Silver Reward Scrolls. These allow the casting of a miracle without worship. Miracles can only be cast, and most other actions performed, within the player's area of influence, which can be extended by expanding the population of villages owned, or by taking over others. Miracles can be selected at the Temple or Village Centre, or by performing certain gestures with the Hand.
