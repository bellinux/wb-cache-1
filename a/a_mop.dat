5|$|The eponymous {{protagonist of}} the series is Septimus Heap. As the seventh son of a seventh son, the aptly named Septimus has {{exceptional}} magical powers. He shares his birthday with Jenna, his adoptive sister, but is presumed dead at birth by his family. For most of the first novel he appears as Boy 412, a child from the Young Army, where he has spent the first ten {{years of his life}} after DomDaniel attempted to abduct him. Thereafter he is apprentice to the ExtraOrdinary Wizard Marcia Overstrand. He has <b>a</b> <b>mop</b> of curly hair, wears green apprentice robes and has a Dragon Ring on his right hand. In the second novel, he acquires a dragon called Spit Fyre as a pet. According to a review in the Manila Standard Today, the contrast between the caution he has learned from an early age and his longing for the love and affection of a family makes him an intriguing character.|$|E

25|$|During lulls in the shelling, Hemingway {{repeatedly}} told Walton {{how much}} he hated his mother. Hemingway loathed her because she had accepted money from him, even while she condemned the books he wrote on moral grounds. Hemingway later saved Walton's life during the battle. Hemingway recognized {{the sound of an}} oncoming German plane, and threw Walton out of the jeep they were riding in just moments before it was strafed. The two men parted, but met again on New Year's Eve in London. Walton told Hemingway {{that he was going to}} have dinner with Hemingway's wife, Martha Gellhorn. Hemingway and Gellhorn were on the verge of divorce after several rocky years of marriage. Hemingway invited himself to the dinner. Hemingway ridiculed and taunted his wife all night, and Walton stood up for her. In the early hours of the next morning, Hemingway stripped to his underwear, put a bucket on his head, and banged on Gellhorn's door with <b>a</b> <b>mop,</b> demanding to be let in. Walton moved into the Hôtel Ritz in Paris in January 1945, covering the war from the liberated city. Hemingway, now openly dating Mary Welsh even though his divorce was not yet final, was in one of the happiest moods of his life. He bragged openly to Walton about his powerful sex life and happiness.|$|E

This paper provides several Multiobjective Optimization Problems (MOPs) {{for use as}} part of a standardized MOEA test suite, and proposes a methodology whereby various MOEAs can be directly compared.

To voice the character of SpongeBob, Hillenburg approached Tom Kenny, {{who had worked with}} him on Rocko's Modern Life.

500|$|To {{voice the}} central {{character}} of the series, Hillenburg turned to Tom Kenny, whose career in animation had started alongside Hillenburg's on Rocko's Modern Life. Elements of Kenny's own personality were employed in further developing the character. Initially, Hillenburg {{wanted to use the}} name SpongeBoy— the character would have had no last name, and the series would have been called SpongeBoy Ahoy! However, the Nickelodeon legal department discovered— after voice acting had been completed for the original seven-minute pilot episode— that the name [...] "SpongeBoy" [...] was already in use for <b>a</b> <b>mop</b> product. A {{character of the}} same name was also already trademarked by Flaming Carrot Comics creator Bob Burden.

He settled on the name [...] "SpongeBob". [...] "SquarePants" [...] was then chosen as a family name after Kenny saw a picture of the character and remarked, [...] "Boy, look at this sponge in square pants, thinking he can get a job in a fast food place."

500|$|Moffat {{found it}} {{interesting}} that the Doctor regularly experienced time out of order and was used to a whole different kind of causality. He believed that the Doctor would attempt to cheat and break his own rules to save the universe from collapsing. The time travel used in the episode {{is compatible with the}} theory of time travel. As the episode features many [...] "time-jumps" [...] when the Doctor travels back to do things seen in the opening credits, Moffat decided to make it less complicated by allowing the audience to figure things out before they occurred. He did this by calling attention to the future-Doctor in the opening scenes by having him wearing a fez and holding <b>a</b> <b>mop,</b> and as the viewers saw the Doctor later acquire these items they would begin to connect the events. Moffat mentioned the fez to fellow executive producers Piers Wenger and Beth Willis; they both were worried that Smith would become too attached to the hat and want to incorporate it into his costume, but Moffat assured him that he was planning on destroying the fez. Wenger later stated that Smith was [...] "one {{of the few people who}} can pull off a fez".|$|E

Inmates were basically entitled to food, clothing, shelter, and medical attention. Anything else was seen as a privilege. Inmates were given a blue shirt, grey pants (blue and white in later years), cotton long underwear, socks and a blue handkerchief; the wearing of caps was forbidden in the cellhouse. Cells were expected to be kept tidy and in good order. Any dangerous article found in the cells or on inmates such as money, narcotics, intoxicating substances or tools which had the potential to inflict injury or assist in an escape attempt was considered contraband and made the prisoners eligible for disciplinary action. It was compulsory for prisoners to shave in their cells three times a week. Attempting to bribe, intimidate, or assault prison officers was seen as a very serious offense. [...] African-Americans were segregated from the rest in cell designation due to racial abuse being prevalent. Toilet paper, matches, soap, and cleanser were issued to the cells on Tuesdays and Saturdays, and inmates could request hot water and <b>a</b> <b>mop</b> to clean their cells. [...] The bars, windows and floors of the prison were cleaned on a daily basis. In earlier years there was a strict code of silence but by the 1950s this had relaxed and talking was permitted in the cellhouse and dining hall provided conversations were quiet and there was no shouting, loud talking, whistling or singing.|$|E

30|$|The {{goal of a}} multi-objective {{evolutionary}} algorithm (MOEA) is to produce an approximate Pareto-optimal set that is well converged, evenly distributed, and well extended. If a set of solutions and its performance indicators are taken as the decision variable and objectives of a new optimization problem, respectively, {{it is more likely}} that a Pareto-optimal set that satisfies the performance indicators will be obtained. Based on this consideration, an MaOP can be transformed into <b>an</b> <b>MOP</b> with two or three objectives, and then a series of set-based evolutionary operators are employed to solve the transformed <b>MOP.</b> <b>A</b> big difference between set-based EAs and indicator-based EAs lies in their individuals. An individual of the former is a set of solutions of problem (1), while an individual of the latter is one solution of problem (1). As a result, their evolutionary operators are totally different.|$|R
