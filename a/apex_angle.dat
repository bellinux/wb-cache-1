40|$|In {{previous}} work, {{authors have}} proposed two new aggregation operators {{for a class}} of LR fuzzy numbers known as triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) in which the L- and R- <b>apex</b> <b>angles</b> of the piecewise continuous linear membership function of the composite or resultant or aggregate TFN are the arithmetic means [1] and the geometric means [2] of the L- and R- <b>apex</b> <b>angles</b> of the individual TFNs. In another paper [3] {{the concept of an}} aggregation operator for triangular fuzzy numbers based on the arithmetic means of the corresponding L- and R- <b>apex</b> <b>angles</b> has been extended for a class of Interval Fuzzy Numbers known as Trapezoidal Fuzzy Numbers (TrFNs) with the left and right side angles treated independently. This paper extends the concept further for TrFNs and an aggregate based on the geometric means of the left and right side <b>apex</b> <b>angles</b> of the individual TrFNs is proposed. The left and right side <b>apex</b> <b>angles</b> have been treated independently. Computation of the aggregate is demonstrated with a numerical example. Corresponding arithmetic and geometric aggregates of the TrFNs and the aggregate of [3] have also been computed...|$|R

Non-ideal cones are also observed, but these are exceptions. One such deviation was a [...] "double" [...] cone, which appeared as if a cone started to grow from its tip with a certain <b>apex</b> <b>angle</b> (e.g. 84°), but then abruptly changed the <b>apex</b> <b>angle</b> (e.g. to 39°) in a single point on its surface, thus producing {{a break in the}} observed cross-section of the cone.
