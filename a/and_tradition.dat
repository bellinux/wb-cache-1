5|$|Ideologically, Poedjangga Baroe {{supported}} a modern, united nation with one language, Indonesian. However, the different {{cultural and political}} views of its contributors led the publication to have undefined leanings. To maintain a neutral political position, the magazine published writings that covered numerous aspects of the political spectrum. In cultural discourse, the magazine published disagreeing polemics over the proper balance of Westernization <b>and</b> <b>tradition</b> necessary for the country's development.|$|E
5|$|The Senate was the {{predominant}} political {{institution in the}} Roman Republic. The Senate's authority derived primarily from custom <b>and</b> <b>tradition.</b> It {{was also one of}} the few places in which free political discussion could take place. The Senate's principal role was as an advisory council to the consuls on matters of foreign and military policy, and it exercised a great deal of influence over consular decision-making.|$|E
5|$|The {{sovereign}} wears {{a variety}} of different robes and other garments {{during the course of the}} ceremony. In contrast to the history <b>and</b> <b>tradition</b> which surround the regalia, it is customary for most coronation robes to be newly made for each monarch.

40|$|In my work I {{focus on}} the <b>traditions</b> <b>and</b> folk customs in the Sedlčany region. I try to {{describe}} their history and current form. The Sedlčany region is interesting not only for natural and cultural monuments, but also for its history, and various famous people, for example Josef Suk and Jakub Krčín from Jelčany and Sedlčany. Various societies and clubs organize marches, music festivals and so on. I divide my work into five chapters. In all of them I concentrate on the customs and habits concerning the spring holidays <b>and</b> <b>traditions</b> (Easter, the Czech celebration of Witches Night and the feast of Saint Florian), the summer holidays <b>and</b> <b>traditions</b> (the Rosa Festival and the Sedlčany pilgrimage), the autumn holidays <b>and</b> <b>traditions</b> (Halloween, All Saints Day, Saint Martin's feast and Advent), the winter holidays <b>and</b> <b>traditions</b> (Christmas, the feast of Three Kings, Carnival and Fat Thursday). I want to prove in my work that Sedlčany is the region, where people still keep folk customs <b>and</b> <b>traditions.</b> Although some traditions have fallen by the way - side during the years, others have quickly been replaced by other <b>traditions</b> <b>and</b> practices, which in turn probably be replaced in the future. Many local people still keep a lot of typical customs <b>and</b> <b>traditions</b> of our culture. They try to pass them to their children, [...] ...|$|R
5|$|A {{school was}} founded in Deir Ghassaneh in 1925. Prior to the British Mandate period, boys would {{normally}} receive education in a kuttab, an elementary-type school with Islamic law <b>and</b> <b>tradition</b> having {{a major influence on}} the curriculum. Today, there is one elementary school (Bani Zeid Elementary School) and one secondary school (Bashir al-Barghouti Secondary School) in the town of Bani Zeid, both run by the government. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Education and Higher Education, in the 2010-2011 academic year there were 26 classes occupied by 691 students, both male and female. There was 45 teaching staff. There are no kindergartens in Bani Zeid. The closest institution for higher learning is Birzeit University in the village of Bir Zeit to the southeast.|$|E
5|$|Alejo Carpentier {{grew up in}} Havana, Cuba and {{was born}} on December 26, 1904 in Lausanne, Switzerland. He {{subsequently}} moved to France in 1933 (at the age of 29) and returned to Cuba six years later, in 1939. Once in Cuba, Carpentier joined {{a group of young}} writers whose goal was to establish a literature faithful to the New World, by recovering origins, history, <b>and</b> <b>tradition.</b> In 1943, he travelled to Haiti, where he was made aware of Dominique Hyppolyte's play, Le Torrent, about the Haitian Revolution, which features a character named Ti Noel. As The Kingdom of This World coincides with Carpentier's return to Cuba, it is very much influenced by the author's re-encounter with himself and his origins.|$|E
5|$|As in {{plot and}} setting, Tolkien brings his {{literary}} theories {{to bear in}} forming characters and their interactions. He portrays Bilbo as a modern anachronism exploring an essentially antique world. Bilbo is able to negotiate and interact within this antique world because language <b>and</b> <b>tradition</b> make connections between the two worlds. For example, Gollum's riddles are taken from old historical sources, while those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books. It is {{the form of the}} riddle game, familiar to both, which allows Gollum and Bilbo to engage each other, rather than the content of the riddles themselves. This idea of a superficial contrast between characters' individual linguistic style, tone and sphere of interest, leading {{to an understanding of the}} deeper unity between the ancient and modern, is a recurring theme in The Hobbit.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{have noted}} that Narayan's {{writings}} {{tend to be more}} descriptive and less analytical; the objective style, rooted in a detached spirit, providing for a more authentic and realistic narration. His attitude, coupled with his perception of life, provided a unique ability to fuse characters and actions, and an ability to use ordinary events to create a connection {{in the mind of the}} reader. A significant contributor to his writing style was his creation of Malgudi, a stereotypical small town, where the standard norms of superstition <b>and</b> <b>tradition</b> apply.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with church requirements <b>and</b> <b>tradition,</b> the Kimballs immediately began {{the transition from}} Arizona to Salt Lake City upon Kimball's call to be an apostle. Kimball sold his share in the KimballGreenhalgh Agency for $65,000 and sold their home and all their other property in Arizona. Kimball was particularly saddened to leave his local Rotary Club chapter and his other professional associations; Camilla worried about leaving her elderly parents in Arizona and relocating their second son, Andrew, {{who had just been}} elected senior class president at Safford High School.|$|E
5|$|Lithuania {{was ruled}} {{during the early}} 13th century {{by a number of}} dukes and princes {{presiding}} over various fiefdoms and tribes. They were loosely bonded by commonalities of religion <b>and</b> <b>tradition,</b> trade, kinship, joint military campaigns, and the presence of captured prisoners from neighboring areas. Western merchants and missionaries began seeking control of the area during the 12th century, establishing the city of Riga, Latvia in 1201. Their efforts in Lithuania were temporarily halted by defeat at the Battle of Saule in 1236, but armed Christian orders continued to pose a threat. The country had also undergone incursions by the Mongol Empire.|$|E

5|$|Roark's modernist {{approach}} to architecture is contrasted {{with that of}} most of the other architects in the novel. In the opening chapter, the dean of his architecture school tells Roark that the best architecture must copy the past rather than innovate or improve. Roark repeatedly loses jobs with architectural firms and commissions from clients because he is unwilling to copy conventional architectural styles. In contrast, Keating's mimicry of convention brings him top honors in school and an immediate job offer. The same conflict between innovation <b>and</b> <b>tradition</b> is reflected in the career of Roark's mentor, Henry Cameron.|$|E
5|$|The {{music group}} Chari Jazz formed in 1964 and {{initiated}} Chad's modern music scene. Later, more renowned {{groups such as}} African Melody and International Challal attempted to mix modernity <b>and</b> <b>tradition.</b> Popular groups such as Tibesti have clung faster to their heritage by drawing on sai, a traditional style of music from southern Chad. The people of Chad have customarily disdained modern music. However, in 1995 greater interest has developed and fostered the distribution of CDs and audio cassettes featuring Chadian artists. Piracy {{and a lack of}} legal protections for artists' rights remain problems to further development of the Chadian music industry.|$|E
5|$|In October and November 2004, the IOC {{established}} an Olympic Programme Commission, which was tasked with reviewing the sports on the Olympic programme and all non-Olympic recognised sports. The {{goal was to}} apply a systematic approach to establishing the Olympic programme for each celebration of the Games. The commission formulated seven criteria to judge whether a sport should be included on the Olympic programme. These criteria are history <b>and</b> <b>tradition</b> of the sport, universality, popularity of the sport, image, athletes' health, development of the International Federation that governs the sport, and costs of holding the sport. From this study five recognised sports emerged as candidates for inclusion at the 2012 Summer Olympics: golf, karate, rugby union, roller sports and squash. These sports were reviewed by the IOC Executive Board and then referred to the General Session in Singapore in July 2005. Of the five sports recommended for inclusion only two were selected as finalists: karate and squash. Neither sport attained the required two-thirds vote and consequently they were not promoted to the Olympic programme. In October 2009 the IOC voted to instate golf and rugby union as Olympic sports for the 2016 and 2020 Summer Olympic Games.|$|E
