25|$|We {{started off}} with no idea at all. We pretty much threw <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> in the pot and went on playing. It {{was a case of}} demand driving it. It took off like a rocket. We got more work than we could travel away, but the thing took {{on a life of its}} own. The thing with the Falcons, we never {{actually}} changed our style that much. We just accumulated new ones. It turned into a stratified thing 'cause we were mixing everything together all the way through. There was no plan. – John Power.|$|E

It's {{people looking for}} answers – and science fiction offers to explain the inexplicable, the same as religion tends to do... If we accept the premise {{that it has a}} mythological element, then <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> about going out into space and meeting new life – trying to explain it and put a human element to it – it's a hopeful vision. All these things offer hope and imaginative solutions for the future." ...|$|E

5000|$|With {{the series}} regular Ian Tracey (playing Mick Leary) inheriting the coroner's job, the show toggles {{back and forth}} between crime scenes and politics. Haddock says: [...] "My {{approach}} was to make <b>all</b> <b>the</b> political <b>stuff</b> criminal and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> criminal <b>stuff</b> political. When we're in city hall we're really about conspiracy and scheming, who's crooked and who's going to get caught." ...|$|R

500|$|Usher started {{recording}} the song on July 2003 in New York City. One day, before {{the night was}} over, Usher was singing about impregnating a mistress and becoming displeased, having found that she is three months pregnant. The theme of cheating inspired him and Dupri, and they then decided to produce two parts of [...] "Confessions": Part I and Part II. Usher said that the former is a [...] "dramatization where a guy confesses <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> he's been doing" [...] against his woman. The latter speaks of impregnating a mistress.|$|E
500|$|Kim Novak, {{who worked}} on Hitchcock's 1957 Vertigo, disputed Hedren's (and the film's) view of the director. Novak told The Daily Telegraph, [...] "I feel bad about <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> people are saying about him now, {{that he was a}} weird character. I did not find him to be weird at all. I never saw him make a pass at anybody or act strange to anybody." [...] Louise Latham, who played Hedren's mother in Marnie, {{dismissed}} claims of Hitchcock's predatory nature in Broadcast magazine: [...] "I find some of the allegations hard to believe...I wasn't aware of her being hassled on the set." ...|$|E
500|$|Frank Spotnitz {{said of the}} episode's origins, [...] "We've {{destroyed}} <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> about Mulder's father, the project, and the Syndicate. All {{the things}} that had sustained us for six years were suddenly gone. We had no crutches. From that point on, every time we sat down to write a mythology show, {{we knew it was}} going to be a completely different challenge." [...] Chris Carter saw the episode as a transitional episode, stating [...] "I felt that, with [...] "The Sixth Extinction", I was just playing a supporting role and that the episode, essentially the middle episode of a three-episode arc, was just a transitional episode to get us to '', which was really less about the mythology and more about Mulder's choices in life." ...|$|E

500|$|Halo 2s soundtrack was {{composed}} primarily by Martin O'Donnell and his musical partner Michael Salvatori, {{the team that}} had composed the critically acclaimed music of Halo. O'Donnell noted in composing the music for Halo 2 that [...] "Making a sequel is never a simple proposition. You want to make everything that was cool even better, and leave out <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> that was weak." [...] O'Donnell made sure that {{no part of the}} game would be completely silent, noting [...] "Ambient sound {{is one of the main}} ways to immerse people psychologically. A dark room is spooky, but add a creaking floorboard and rats skittering in the walls and it becomes really creepy." [...] Halo 2, unlike its predecessor, was mixed to take full advantage of Dolby 5.1 Digital surround sound.|$|E

Recognizing the {{character}} for his appearance in The Simpsons Movie, Filmcritic called him [...] "the most awesomely funny town drunk in pop culture". IGN ranked Barney fifth {{on their list}} of the [...] "Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters" [...] in 2006, stating that, [...] "he's been a dependable source of humor through his many drunken asides, burps included...Occasionally he's sobered up...But let's face it, for comedy's sake, The Simpsons is {{better off with a}} drunken Barney mouthing off at Moe's."

His role as the nominal hero in Pit {{would prove to be}} the last notable film appearance of his career. [...] Years later, Kerr expressed surprise that Pit seemed to be his best remembered role, [...] "If you had told me years ago that Pit and the Pendulum would be The One out of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> I've done, if you had told me that this would be the cult-type movie that people would be collecting memorabilia on, I would have said, 'You're out of your gourd.'

500|$|For the Vertigo Tour, {{the group}} {{originally}} considered dropping the song from their set lists, but Mullen and Clayton successfully argued against this. All 131 of the Vertigo Tour concerts featured {{a performance of}} the song, which were accompanied by the stage's LED video curtains displaying African flags. On the tour's opening night, this reminded Bono that he had originally written the lyrics in an Ethiopian village. He thought this visual accompaniment made the song come full circle, saying, [...] "And here it was, nearly twenty years later, coming back to Africa, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> about parched lands and deserts making sense for the first time." [...] The song was also played at the preview screening of the band's concert film U2 3D at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. [...] At the Glastonbury Festival 2010, The Edge accompanied rock band Muse for a live cover version of the track, later playing it with U2 while headlining Glastonbury in 2011.|$|E
500|$|According to Jean, the episode's table read went [...] "great" [...] {{until the}} third act. The Simpsons writers found the third act [...] "pretty challenging" [...] to write, because by having Homer's jaws wired shut, they [...] "took [...] funniest character" [...] and [...] "remove comedy." [...] In the DVD {{commentary}} for the episode, Selman {{described it as}} [...] "It's the comedy of saying: 'Oh, he [...] can't do <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> {{you want him to}} do'." [...] It was also hard to [...] "keep the story moving" [...] back to normal, since they kept having to [...] "re-use the premise". The episode features American comedian John Kassir as one of the dogs in the gay pride parade {{in the beginning of the}} episode. Barbara Walters and Star Jones, the hosts of The View, were portrayed by American voice-actor Tress MacNeille. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Jean stated that MacNeille is [...] "very versatile". Lisa Ling and Joy Behar were portrayed by voice-actor Pamela Hayden.|$|E

Pianist Gerald Clayton (born 1984) summarized Mehldau's importance in a 2013 interview: [...] "He brought in a new feel and sound in jazz. I don't know a single modern pianist who hasn't taken something from Brad. I told him that I should be arrested for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> I've stolen from him." [...] Redman said in 2010 that Largo had been particularly important to musicians: [...] "Brad has had a lot of influential records, [...] if you talk to musicians, especially younger musicians, so many of them will name that as a defining record."

500|$|In 1994, Conran {{set up a}} bluescreen in {{his living}} room and began {{assembling}} the tools he would need to create his movie. He was not interested in working his way through the system and instead wanted to follow the route of independent filmmakers like Steven Soderbergh. Initially, Kerry and his brother had nothing more than [...] "just a vague idea of this guy who flew a plane. We would talk about all the obvious things like Indiana Jones and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> we liked." [...] Conran spent four years making a black and white teaser trailer in the style of an old-fashioned movie serial on his Macintosh IIci personal computer. Once he was finished, Conran showed it to producer Marsha Oglesby, who was a friend of his brother's wife and she recommended that he let producer Jon Avnet see it. Conran met Avnet and showed him the trailer. Conran told him that he wanted to make it into a movie. They spent two or three days just talking about the tone of the movie.|$|E

500|$|While Ozzy Osbourne {{was working}} on new solo album {{material}} in 2006, Rhino Records released , a compilation of songs culled from the four Black Sabbath releases featuring Ronnie James Dio. For the release, Iommi, Butler, Dio and Appice reunited to write and record three new songs as Black Sabbath. The Dio Years was released on 3 April 2007, reaching number 54 on the Billboard 200, while the single [...] "The Devil Cried" [...] reached number 37 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Pleased with the results, Iommi and Dio decided to reunite the Mob Rules era line-up for a world tour. While the line-up of Osbourne, Butler, Iommi and Ward were still officially called Black Sabbath, the new line-up opted to call themselves Heaven & Hell, after the album of the same name, to avoid confusion. When asked about {{the name of the}} group, Iommi stated [...] "it really is Black Sabbath, whatever we do... so everyone knows what they're getting [...] so people won't expect to hear 'Iron Man' and all those songs.

[...] "And what's really funny about that is, all the parts of A.I. that people assume were Stanley's were mine. And all the parts of A.I. that people accuse me of {{sweetening}} and softening and sentimentalizing were all Stanley's. The teddy bear was Stanley's. The whole last 20 minutes of the movie was completely Stanley's. The whole first 35, 40 minutes of the film– <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> in the house– was word for word, from Stanley's screenplay. This was Stanley's vision." [...] "Eighty percent of the critics got it all mixed up. But I could see why. Because, obviously, I've {{done a lot of}} movies where people have cried and have been sentimental. And I've been accused of sentimentalizing hard-core material. But in fact it was Stanley who did the sweetest parts of A.I., not me.

500|$|The main {{instrumentation}} {{was recorded}} by Bloodshy & Avant at Bloodshy & Avant Studios in Stockholm, Sweden.

500|$|Previous {{series of}} Jonathan Creek had {{featured}} first Caroline Quentin, and then Julia Sawalha as Jonathan's assistants Maddy Magellan and Carla Borrego, respectively. Quentin {{departed from the}} show {{at the end of}} its third series in 2000 in order to try for a second child, while Sawalha temporarily retired from acting in 2004, having become so disillusioned that she was [...] "dragging self out of bed" [...] by the end of the show's fourth series in order to film episodes. Davies explained that Renwick had always believed Jonathan needed a sidekick character, and that: [...] "You can't really have Jonathan Creek without his sounding board when <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> is going on in his mind. In a novel you can have an interior monologue when a leading character is working out what's going on, but for a film or television you have to have Dr Watson for Sherlock Holmes, it's somebody for Holmes to explain it to." [...] For [...] "The Grinning Man", a new sidekick was created in the form of Joey Ross, played by actress Sheridan Smith. Renwick described the opportunity to work with Smith as a major catalyst in his decision to revive the show. The actress had previously appeared in his series Love Soup, and Renwick's wife suggested pairing her with Davies in the new episode. Smith was approached about the role before the episode's script was written, and after readily agreeing to take the part of Ross, Renwick wrote the character's dialogue with Smith's northern accent in mind. The actress found accustoming herself to [...] "detective talk" [...] the hardest part of the role, explaining: [...] "You slow down, and then speed up at the end. I kept watching Alan and going, 'I can’t do this figuring out talk.' But I learned from the master." [...] Smith enjoyed the challenge the role presented, stating: [...] "He's [...] written this feisty little northern character, and I am really honoured because he's such a great writer. I have always played chavs and slappers so I wasn't used to being an intelligent young girl." ...|$|E
