5|$|Although {{not a true}} coral, Millepora alcicornis {{is subject}} to the same general threats that corals and coral reefs <b>are</b> <b>facing.</b> <b>The</b> {{greatest}} of these is global warming and the consequent rise in sea temperatures. Millepora alcicornis {{is one of the first}} corals to show bleaching as the symbiont zooxanthellae are killed. However, it is also more resilient than most and becomes re-established by recruitment earlier than the scleractinian corals. Other general threats to reefs include ocean acidification, pollution, sedimentation, invasive species and other changes in species dynamics, coral diseases, fisheries, leisure activities and tourism. Small quantities of Millepora alcicornis are gathered for sale to collectors.|$|E
5|$|Many human {{diseases}} are not static phenomena, but capable of evolution. Viruses, bacteria, fungi and cancers evolve to be resistant to host immune defences, {{as well as}} pharmaceutical drugs. These same problems occur in agriculture with pesticide and herbicide resistance. It is possible that we <b>are</b> <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> end of the effective life of most of available antibiotics and predicting the evolution and evolvability of our pathogens and devising strategies to slow or circumvent it is requiring deeper knowledge of the complex forces driving evolution at the molecular level.|$|E
5|$|The katipo {{typically}} catches wandering ground invertebrates such as beetles (e.g. Cecyropa modesta) or amphipods (e.g. Bellorchestia quoyana), {{but it may}} occasionally catch moths, flies, {{and other}} spiders. Katipo can catch insects much larger than themselves. These larger insects often become entangled in the web and in the ensuing struggle, the web's ground anchor line breaks. Due to the silk's elasticity, this causes the prey to become suspended a few centimetres off the ground. The katipo then moves to the prey, turns so that the spinnerets <b>are</b> <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> insect and spins silk over it. Like most theridiids, the tarsi of the hind legs have a row of strong curved bristles which are arranged as a comb. The katipo uses these to scoop sticky silk from her spinnerets and throws it over the insect {{with a series of}} rapid movements. After the insect is firmly immobilised, she bites it several times, usually at the joints, before spinning more silk to strengthen the web, and then administering a last long bite which ultimately kills the insect. The spider then moves the prey up into the web until it is ready to eat. If food is readily available then it is common to see five or six insects hanging in the web waiting to be ingested. The male's hunting behaviour is similar to the female's, although may not be as vigorous due to its smaller size.|$|E

500|$|The spores are {{elliptical}} to spindle-shaped, with {{dimensions of}} 12–17 by 5–7µm. The basidia, the spore-bearing cells, are produced in a layer lining the tubes, and arrange themselves so their ends <b>are</b> <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> {{center of the}} tube; this layer of cells is known technically as a hymenium. The basidia are thin-walled, mostly attached to four spores, and measure 25–30 by 8–10µm. Another cell type present in the hymenium is the cystidia, larger sterile cells that protrude beyond the basidia into the lumen of the hymenium, and act as air traps, regulating humidity. B.edulis has pleurocystidia (cystidia located {{on the face of}} a pore) that are thin-walled, roughly spindle-shaped to ventricose, and measure 30–45 by 7–10µm; the [...] "stuffed" [...] feature of the hymenium is caused by cheilocystidia—cells found on the edges of the pores. The hyphae of B.edulis do not have clamp connections.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} create the Night King, {{according}} to Barrie Gower, it is primarily practical prosthetic, but also incorporates some VFX {{to create a more}} icy look and feel, saying about the eyes, [...] "The effects department alters the eyes in post-production. They give them that blue-glowy hue to them, which we can't really achieve with contact lenses." [...] In regards to the overall prosthetic, [...] "they've added this sort of icy layer over the top of him to create this — it's something incredibly difficult to achieve practically, prosthetics are cast in a translucent rubber, which can only give you so much of that icy quality, so visual effects help augment it a little bit further to give it more dimension." [...] Prior to the sixth season, the Night King was portrayed by Richard Brake, with a head mold of Brake being created in order to accurately mold the prosthetic to his face. In the sixth season he was portrayed by Vladimir Furdik. The White Walker army was first shot in front of a green screen in Magheramorne quarry, and according to a piece in The Hollywood Reporter [...] "A scan was taken from a drone and used as the basis for a CG model of the location, which was augmented with VFX and joined with volcanic hills that were photographed in Iceland." [...] Crowd replication was used to create the 1,000-man army, with special effects supervisor Joe Bauer saying [...] "It's scans of those actors in the makeup and costumes, with variations we used to make a digital army that extends up onto the hills." [...] Bauer also noted that VFX were used to create the weather conditions in the scene, noting [...] "It's wind, mist, fog and heavy atmosphere that you'd get in a marine layer. The dramatic value is to say something's wrong; it's a mystery what they <b>are</b> <b>facing.</b> <b>The</b> temperature drops, and our characters can see their breath. The weather obscures their vision." [...] Spain-based El Ranchito, one of several special effects companies used by Game of Thrones, was responsible for the White Walker army shots.|$|E

2500|$|The {{figures are}} all shown facing frontally. While facing the frontal view in Hellenistic {{painting}} {{was one of}} many possibilities, it was now the general fashion in Parthian art. The figures <b>are</b> <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> viewer, and even in narrative representations one has the feeling that individual characters no longer interact with each other, but are only directed at the viewer. The perspective that it was in Greek style, has largely been disasserted. A certain space of the figures is only indicated by shading on individual parts of the body. The base line, which had {{played a significant role in}} Near Eastern art, began to have no meaning. The figures now seem often to float freely in space. At least the majority of the paintings at Dura Europos were commissioned by private donors.

2500|$|Charnia fossils were {{originally}} {{found in the}} Charnwood Forest in England, hence named Charnia. [...] These fossils are from marine organisms that lived {{on the bottom of}} the ocean floor. The fossils have a fractal body plan and were frond shaped, meaning they resembled broad-leafed plants such as ferns. However they could not have been plants since they resided in the dark depths of the ocean floor. In Charnwood Forest, Charnia was found as an isolated species, however there were many more fossils found on the East Coast of Canada in Mistaken Point in Newfoundland. Charnia was attached to the bottom of the ocean floor, and was strongly current aligned. This is seen because there are disk-like shapes at the bottom of the Charnia fossil, which show where Charnia was tethered, and all the nearby fossils <b>are</b> <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> same direction. These fossils at Mistaken Point were preserved well under volcanic ash and layers of soft mud. It has been determined via radiometric dating of the fossils that Charnia must have lived around 565 million years ago.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} days, {{education}} on the Tsing Yi Island was mostly private. The first public school on the island is Tsing Yi Public School, a primary school founded by villagers and businessmen on the island. In the post-World War II era, Hong Kong Government provides 9-year free education to all children from primary one to secondary three. The public school is then mainly funded by the government. Another school {{for the children of}} fishermen, Tsing Yi Fishermen's Children's Primary School, was founded by Fish Marketing Organisation. In 1977, Cheung Ching Estate, the first public housing estates on the island, {{marked the beginning of the}} new town on the island. To accommodate new schooling children, three primary schools and Buddhist Yip Kei Nam Memorial College, the first secondary school on the island, were built with the estate. [...] More schools were erected when new estates were completed. In 1999, a post-secondary college, Hong Kong Technical College (Tsing Yi), was completed and provides vocational training for all adults in Hong Kong. In the 2000s, the number of schooling children began to drop and the several schools <b>are</b> <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> fatal fate.|$|E
2500|$|Of the {{all animals}} deer {{is the most}} represented, and mostly is found on stećci in Herzegovina. According to Dragoslav Srejović, spread of Christianity didn't cause {{disappearance}} of old cult and belief in sacred deer. Wenzel considered it lead the deceased to underworld. Historian Šefik Bešlagić synthesized the representations of deer: sometime accompanied by a bird (often on the back or horns), cross or lilium, frequently are shown series of deer or doe, as well with a bow and arrow, dog and hunter(s) with a spear or sword (often on a horse). It is displayed in hunting scenes, as well some kolo processions which are led {{by a man who}} is riding a deer. There scenes where deers calmly approach the hunter, or deers with enormous size and sparse horns. Most of the depictions of [...] "deer hunting" [...] <b>are</b> <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> West, which had the symbolic meaning for death and otherworld. In the numerous hunting scenes in only one deer is wounded (the stećak has some anomalies), indicating unrealistic meaning.
