5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Wu {{wrote the}} {{patriotic}} war play City of Phoenix (凤凰城), {{which made him}} well-known in China at age 20. It {{was one of the}} most performed dramas during the eight-year war. He later wrote several critically acclaimed plays, including Return on a Snowy Night, which is generally considered his masterpiece. His works are strongly influenced by the May Fourth New Culture Movement.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the war, Frederick {{had one of}} {{the finest}} armies in Europe: his troops—any company—could fire at least four volleys a minute, and some of them could fire five. By the end of 1757, {{the course of the war}} had gone well for Prussia, and poorly for Austria. Prussia had {{achieved}} spectacular victories at Rossbach and Leuthen and reconquered parts of Silesia that had fallen to Austria.|$|E
5|$|Held at a {{price of}} C$829 million, the Calgary Olympics cost more to stage than any {{previous}} Games, summer or winter. The high cost was anticipated, as organizers were aware <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> their bid that most facilities {{would have to be}} constructed. The venues, constructed primarily with public money, were designed to have lasting use beyond the Games and were planned to become the home of several of Canada's national winter sports teams.|$|E

5|$|In 1875, McCreary {{was one of}} four men, all former Confederate soldiers, {{who sought}} the Democratic gubernatorial nomination—the others being John Stuart Williams, J. Stoddard Johnson, and George B. Hodge. Williams was {{considered}} the favorite for the nomination <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the Democratic nominating convention, despite attacks on his character by newspapers {{in the western part of}} the state. However, McCreary defeated Williams on the fourth ballot.|$|E
5|$|Provisions loaded <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> {{the voyage}} {{included}} 6,000 pieces of pork and 4,000 of beef, nine tons of bread, five tons of flour, three tons of sauerkraut, one ton of raisins and sundry quantities of cheese, salt, peas, oil, sugar and oatmeal. Alcohol supplies consisted of 250 barrels of beer, 44 barrels of brandy and 17 barrels of rum.|$|E
5|$|Several of {{the actors}} were {{specialised}} comedians, notably Joseph Haines who played the false-wit character Sparkish, Alithea's original fiancé. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> his high-profile career as comedian and song-and-dance man, young Haines already {{had a reputation for}} eccentricity and dominant stage presence, suggesting that Sparkish is not merely a comic butt for the truewits Horner, Harcourt, and Dorilant to mock, but also a real threat to the romance of Harcourt and Alithea.|$|E

5|$|After her World War I service ended, Siboney was {{returned}} to the Ward Line and placed in New York–Cuba–Spain transatlantic service; the liner ran aground at Vigo, Spain in September 1920. Despite considerable damage, she was repaired and placed back in service. In late 1921, Siboney was switched to New York–Cuba–Mexico routes, which were a popular and inexpensive way for Americans to escape Prohibition. In late 1940, she was chartered to American Export Lines to return Americans fleeing Europe <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> World War II, making seven roundtrips from Jersey City, New Jersey, to Lisbon.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1847, Palmer {{traveled}} {{with his family}} to Oregon as captain of that year's major wagon train. While passing through the Walla Walla Valley he met Marcus and Narcissa Whitman at their mission shortly before their deaths in the Whitman massacre—the event that precipitated the Cayuse War. Perhaps motivated by meeting the Whitmans, Palmer later returned to serve as a peace commissioner to tribes considering joining the Cayuse. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the war he was appointed as commissary-general of the Provisional Government’s militia forces.|$|E

5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the 19th century {{most of the}} European {{settlements}} {{were related}} to the fur trade. The largest of these settlements were trading posts established by the North West Company, particularly those at Sandy Lake, Leech Lake, and Fond du Lac. Historian Grace Lee Nute has documented over 100 fur trading posts of varying sizes in the Minnesota area before statehood. Most of these posts were eventually taken over by the American Fur Company. When several hundred settlers abandoned the Red River Colony in the 1820s, they entered the United States by way of the Red River Valley, instead of moving to eastern Canada or returning to Europe, adding to the Minnesota region's population.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the 2006 season, Sanchez {{competed for}} the {{starting}} quarterback position; once Booty, a junior, suffered severe back spasms caused by a pre-existing back condition, surgery was required and Sanchez was promoted to run the first-team offense during the spring as Booty recovered. Coaches stated Booty would be considered {{the starting quarterback}} when he returned for fall practice. During the 2006 season, Sanchez saw limited playing time in games against Arkansas, Stanford and Oregon. Through those three games, Sanchez completed 3 of his 7 pass attempts for 63 yards and one interception. He also saw additional action against Arizona, Michigan, and Notre Dame {{but he did not}} attempt a pass in those contests.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the Korean War, Leyte {{was ordered}} to the Korean Peninsula, {{arriving}} in October 1950. Brown, an ensign, flew 20 combat missions before his F4U Corsair aircraft came under fire and crashed on a remote mountaintop on 4 December 1950 while supporting ground troops at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. Brown died of his wounds {{despite the efforts of}} wingman Thomas J. Hudner, Jr., who intentionally crashed his own aircraft in a rescue attempt, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E

In 1912 the El Segundo school district formed out of territory in the Wiseburn district and {{was a part of}} the Inglewood high school district. El Segundo withdrew from CVUHSD on November 22, 1925, when the El Segundo Unified School District was formed.|$|R
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, in {{the second}} half of the 16th century, Poland–Lithuania became an {{elective}} monarchy, in which the king was elected by the hereditary nobility. This king would serve as the monarch until he died, at which time the country would have another election. This monarchy has been commonly referred to as a rzeczpospolita or republic, because of the high degree of influence wielded by the noble classes, often seen as a single non-homogenous class.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the Second World War, {{due to the}} {{provisions}} of the Defence Act (1903) which prohibited sending the Militia to fight outside of Australian territory, {{the decision was made to}} raise an all volunteer force, the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF), to serve overseas—initial operations were conceived to be likely in the Middle East, France and later possibly England—while it was decided that the Militia would be used to defend the Australian mainland from possible attack and to improve Australia's overall level of readiness through the reinstitution of compulsory military service and extended periods of continuous periods of training.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the war, Australia's {{economy had}} been quite small and {{dependent}} largely upon agriculture and the resources industries for export earnings, while most manufactured products were imported from overseas. Almost immediately uncertainty over the continuation of foreign trade led to a rise in unemployment, indeed {{it was estimated that}} after only a couple of days of Britain having declared war, that up to 15,000 men had been retrenched in New South Wales alone due to concerns about the continued availability of foreign markets for Australian produce.|$|E

5|$|Based on Henry VIII's {{desire for}} an {{annulment}} {{of his marriage}} (first requested of Pope Clement VII in 1527), the English Reformation was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> more <b>of</b> a political affair than a theological dispute.

5|$|Civilian {{telephones}} {{were used}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the war, {{but they were}} found to be unreliable in the damp, muddy conditions that prevailed. Consequently, the field telephone was designed; a device that operated with its own switchboard. Apart from voice communication, it featured a buzzer unit with a Morse code key, so that it could be used to send and receive coded messages. This facility proved useful when, in the midst of bombardment, exploding shells drowned out voice communication. The telephones were connected by lines that sustained continual damage as a result of shell fire and the movement of troops. The lines were generally buried, with redundant lines set in place to compensate for breakages.|$|E
5|$|Facing the Wehrmacht {{were three}} Soviet fronts forming a {{defensive}} {{line between the}} cities of Vyazma and Bryansk, which barred the way to Moscow. The armies comprising these fronts had also been involved in heavy fighting. Still, it was a formidable concentration consisting of 1,250,000 men, 1,000 tanks and 7,600 guns. The Soviet Air Force (Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily, VVS) had suffered appalling losses of some 7,500 to 21,200 aircraft. Extraordinary industrial achievements had begun to replace these, and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> Typhoon the VVS could muster 936 aircraft, 578 of which were bombers.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to stave off the}} Civil War, Dixon participated in a {{convention}} of border states and a peace convention in Frankfort, Kentucky, both in 1861. Both conventions were unsuccessful. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the war, the Kentucky General Assembly elected six arbiters to recommend a course of action for the Commonwealth. Dixon represented the pro-Union position along with John J. Crittenden and Samuel S. Nicholas. Kentucky governor Beriah Magoffin, John C. Breckinridge, and Richard Hawes represented the southern sympathizers. The arbiters met on May 11, 1861. After the pro-Union men defeated a proposal to call a sovereignty convention, the six arbiters recommended a position of neutrality, which the General Assembly adopted.|$|E
30|$|The {{cradle-to-cradle}} approach {{advocated by}} McDonough and Braungart (2002) is, {{to a large}} extent, centred on the utilisation of up-to-date technology to simplify state-of-the-art products and processes in an appropriate manner.
