5|$|While moving {{within the}} cabin, Aldrin accidentally damaged the circuit breaker that would arm the main engine for lift {{off from the}} Moon. There was concern this would prevent firing the engine, {{stranding}} them on the Moon. Fortunately, a felt-tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch. Had this not worked, the Lunar Module circuitry could have been reconfigured to allow firing the <b>ascent</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Apollo 5 mission {{tested the}} Lunar Module {{in a space}} environment, in {{particular}} its descent and <b>ascent</b> <b>engine</b> systems, {{and its ability to}} separate the ascent and descent stages. The descent engine would become the first throttleable rocket engine fired in space.|$|E
25|$|The first {{unmanned}} launch {{was originally}} planned in April 1967, requiring delivery at the Cape around September 1966. But delays kept occurring. Although the Lunar Module was fully designed, {{there was trouble}} fabricating the custom-made parts. The engines were also having problems. The descent engine was not burning smoothly, and the <b>ascent</b> <b>engine</b> was having fabrication and welding difficulties.|$|E

40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} with the RS 18 rocket engine using liquid oxygen (LO 2) and liquid methane (LCH 4) propellants under simulated altitude conditions at NASA Johnson Space Center White Sands Test Facility (WSTF). This project is part of NASA s Propulsion and Cryogenics Advanced Development (PCAD) project. "Green" propellants, such as LO 2 /LCH 4, offer savings in both performance and safety over equivalently sized hypergolic propellant systems in spacecraft applications such as <b>ascent</b> <b>engines</b> or service module engines. Altitude simulation was achieved using the WSTF Large Altitude Simulation System, which provided altitude conditions equivalent up to approx. 120, 000 ft (approx. 37 km). For specific impulse calculations, engine thrust and propellant mass flow rates were measured. Propellant flow rate was measured using a coriolis-style mass-flow meter and compared with a serial turbine-style flow meter. Results showed a significant performance measurement difference during ignition startup. LO 2 flow ranged from 5. 9 - 9. 5 lbm/sec (2. 7 - 4. 3 kg/sec), and LCH 4 flow varied from 3. 0 - 4. 4 lbm/sec (1. 4 - 2. 0 kg/sec) during the RS- 18 hot-fire test series. Thrust was measured using three load cells in parallel. Ignition was demonstrated using a gaseous oxygen/methane spark torch igniter. Data was obtained at multiple chamber pressures, and calculations were performed for specific impulse, C* combustion efficiency, and thrust vector alignment. Test objectives for the RS- 18 project are 1) conduct a shakedown of the test stand for LO 2 /methane lunar <b>ascent</b> <b>engines,</b> 2) obtain vacuum ignition data for the torch and pyrotechnic igniters, and 3) obtain nozzle kinetics data to anchor two-dimensional kinetics codes...|$|R
500|$|Film {{taken from}} the LM Ascent Stage upon liftoff from the Moon reveals the American flag, planted some [...] from the descent stage, {{whipping}} violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine. Aldrin looked up in time to witness the flag topple: [...] "The ascent stage of the LM separated... I was concentrating on the computers, and Neil was studying the attitude indicator, but I looked up {{long enough to see}} the flag fall over." [...] Subsequent Apollo missions usually planted the American flags at least [...] from the LM to prevent them being blown over by the <b>ascent</b> <b>engine</b> exhaust.|$|E
500|$|Apollo 5 (AS-204) was {{the first}} {{unmanned}} test flight of LM in Earth orbit, launched from pad 37 on January 22, 1968, by the Saturn IB {{that would have been}} used for Apollo 1. The LM engines were successfully test-fired and restarted, despite a computer programming error which cut short the first descent stage firing. The <b>ascent</b> <b>engine</b> was fired in abort mode, known as a [...] "fire-in-the-hole" [...] test, where it was lit simultaneously with jettison of the descent stage. Although Grumman wanted a second unmanned test, George Low decided the next LM flight would be manned.|$|E
2500|$|The ground {{controllers}} {{moved to}} an alternate plan {{to fire the}} descent engine manually two more times. They then performed the [...] "fire in the hole" [...] test and another <b>ascent</b> <b>engine</b> burn.|$|E
50|$|The {{ascent stage}} {{contained}} the crew cabin, instrument panels, overhead hatch/docking port, forward hatch, optical and electronic guidance systems, reaction control system, radar and communications antennas, <b>ascent</b> rocket <b>engine</b> and fuel {{to return to}} lunar orbit and rendezvous with the Apollo Command and Service Modules.|$|R
2500|$|The mission also {{performed}} a simulation of a landing abort, {{in which the}} <b>ascent</b> stage <b>engine</b> would be fired while still attached to the descent stage. This, referred to by engineers as the [...] "fire in the hole" [...] test, was depicted in the mission's insignia patch.|$|R
50|$|After finally {{jettisoning}} the LM, the CSM {{performed a}} small RCS burn to further {{separate from the}} LM. Falcon was directed to burn its <b>ascent</b> stage <b>engine,</b> {{so that it would}} impact the lunar surface. The delay has meant it would not impact in the planned site, instead impacting at 26°12' N, 0°6' E, about 56 miles (90 km) from the landing site.|$|R

50|$|Phase 4: 1975-1976: This Lunar Surface Rendezvous and Exploration Phase {{nominally}} {{consisted of}} two dual-launch missions. A Lunar Payload Module (LPM - essentially the LM Truck of earlier studies) would be delivered by an unmanned cargo carrier {{to the surface and}} provide a rendezvous target for a manned ELM that would arrive up to 3 months later. The Apollo LM Shelter was essentially an Apollo LM with <b>ascent</b> stage <b>engine</b> and fuel tanks removed and replaced with consumables and scientific equipment for 14 days' extended lunar exploration.|$|R
50|$|A {{configuration}} freeze did {{not start}} until April 1963, when the <b>ascent</b> and descent <b>engine</b> designs were decided. In addition to Rocketdyne, a parallel program for the descent engine was ordered from Space Technology Laboratories (TRW) in July 1963, and by January 1965 the Rocketdyne contract was canceled.|$|R
50|$|Spacecraft {{attitude}} control and orbital maneuvering thrusters are almost universally pressure-fed designs.Examples include the Reaction Control (RCS) and the Orbital Maneuvering (OMS) engines of the Space Shuttle orbiter; the RCS and Service Propulsion System (SPS) engines on the Apollo Command/Service Module; the SuperDraco (propulsive landing) and Draco (RCS) engines on the Dragon V2; and the RCS, <b>ascent</b> and descent <b>engines</b> on the Apollo Lunar Module.|$|R
50|$|During {{the spring}} of 1963, Grumman hired Bell to develop the Lunar Module <b>ascent</b> <b>engine,</b> on the {{assumption}} that Bell's experience in development of the Air Force Agena engine would be transferable to the Lunar Module requirements. Grumman placed heavy emphasis upon high reliability through simplicity of design, and the <b>ascent</b> <b>engine</b> emerged as the least complicated of the three main engines in the Apollo space vehicle, including the LM descent and CSM service propulsion system engines.|$|E
50|$|Embodying a {{pressure-fed}} {{fuel system}} using hypergolic (self-igniting) propellants, the <b>ascent</b> <b>engine</b> was fixed-thrust and nongimbaled, capable of lifting the ascent stage off the Moon or aborting a landing if necessary.|$|E

5000|$|Due to poor {{weather in}} the area, the {{chartered}} Bell 206 helicopter carrying Wells landed at a remote location {{about two and a}} half hours prior to the crash. While waiting for improved weather conditions, snow fell on the helicopter. During the subsequent take-off and <b>ascent,</b> the <b>engine</b> lost power and the aircraft crashed on a 30 degree slope followed by a roll over during an attempted emergency landing. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the accident was, [...] "the ingestion of foreign material (snow) in the engine, which resulted in a flameout (loss of engine power)". Of the five persons onboard, four did not survive the accident.|$|R

25|$|Upon landing, {{the crew}} {{would put on}} their extravehicular {{activity}} (EVA) spacesuits and commence the first of five to seven lunar EVAs, collecting samples and deploying experiments. After completing their Lunar Sortie operations, the crew would then enter the Altair and fire the <b>ascent</b> stage <b>engine</b> to lift off from the surface, using the descent stage as a launchpad (and leaving it as a platform for future base construction). Upon entering orbit, the Altair would rendezvous and dock with the waiting Orion spacecraft, and the crew would then transfer, along with samples collected on the Moon, back to the Orion. After jettisoning the Altair, the crew would perform the Trans Earth Injection (TEI) burn for the return trip to Earth.|$|R
50|$|The RS-18 is a reconfigured {{version of}} the Rocketdyne Lunar Module <b>Ascent</b> <b>Engine</b> (LMAE), {{modified}} to burn liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid methane (CH4) for NASA's Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS) engine testing in 2008.|$|E
50|$|Upon descent stage {{separation}} and <b>ascent</b> <b>engine</b> ignition, the Lunar Module began to roll violently because the crew accidentally duplicated commands into the flight computer which took the LM out of abort mode, the correct configuration for this maneuver. The live network broadcasts caught Cernan and Stafford uttering several expletives before regaining {{control of the}} LM. Cernan has said he observed the horizon spinning eight times over, indicating eight rolls of the spacecraft under <b>ascent</b> <b>engine</b> power. While the incident was downplayed by NASA, the roll was just several revolutions from being unrecoverable, which {{would have resulted in}} the LM crashing into the lunar surface.|$|E
50|$|Rocketdyne {{brought the}} Lunar Module <b>Ascent</b> <b>Engine</b> (LMAE) {{out of its}} 36-year retirement, now {{designated}} as RS-18, and reconfigured this non-throttleable hypergolic engine to use LOX/Methane for NASA Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS) engine testing in 2008.|$|E
5000|$|After being jettisoned, Snoopys <b>ascent</b> stage <b>engine</b> {{was fired}} to fuel depletion, sending it on a {{trajectory}} past the Moon into a heliocentric orbit.

In 2011, a group of amateur astronomers in the UK started a project to search for it.|$|R
5000|$|During the <b>ascent,</b> an <b>engine</b> anomaly {{occurred}} {{with one of}} the nine engines on the Falcon 9 first stage. SpaceX has emphasized for several years that the Falcon 9 first stage is designed for [...] "engine out" [...] capability, with the capability to shut down one or more malfunctioning engines and still make a successful ascent. [...] In the event, the SpaceX CRS-1's first stage shut down engine no. 1, and as a result continued the first-stage burn on the remaining eight engines longer than usual at a somewhat reduced thrust to insert the Dragon spacecraft into the proper orbit. Although unintended, this was the first inflight demonstration of Falcon 9's [...] "engine out" [...] design, and [...] "provides a clear demonstration of the engine out capability." ...|$|R

40|$|The Evolvable Mars Campaign is {{developing}} concepts for human missions {{to the surface}} of Mars. These missions are round-trip expeditions, thereby requiring crew launch via a Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV). A study to identify the smallest possible pressurized cabin for this mission has developed a conceptual vehicle referred to as the minimal MAV cabin. The origin of this concept will be discussed as well as its initial concept definition. This will lead to a description of possible configurations to integrate the minimal MAV cabin with <b>ascent</b> vehicle <b>engines</b> and propellant tanks. Limitations of this concept will be discussed, in particular those that argue against the use of the minimal MAV cabin to perform the MAV mission.

40|$|In January 2004, the President of the United States {{established}} the Vision for Space Exploration (VSE) to return {{man to the}} moon and ultimately to extend manned space travel to Mars. This paper will summarize the manned space flight liquid propulsion system needs in support of Project Constellation over the next 10 years. It will include all engine needs to return man to the moon. An overview of engines currently under contract, those baselined but not yet under contract, and those engine needs that hav. e yet to be initiated. Project Constellation includes the components as shown Figure 1. Liquid propulsion systems supporting the manned portion of these elements include the following: the Crew Exploration Vehicle named Orion (crew module reaction control system (CMRCS), service module Orion Main Engine (OME), service module auxiliary RCS, and service module reaction control system (SMRCS)), the Crew Launch Vehicle named Ares 1 (J 2 X upper stage, first stage roll control system, second stage reaction control system, and the Ares I-X roll control system), the Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle named Ares V (RS 68 B first stage booster, J- 2 X upper stage, roll control systems, and the Earth Departure Stage (EDS) (powered by the same Ares V Upper Stage J- 2 X), and the Lunar Lander named Altair with both descent and ascent stages (lunar orbit insertion and descent main <b>engine,</b> <b>ascent</b> main <b>engine,</b> and attitude control systems for both stages). In addition, there may be additional engine needs for early demonstrators, but those will not be speculated on as part of this paper.

40|$|The National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) has {{identified}} Liquid Oxygen (LO 2) /Liquid Methane (LCH 4) {{as a potential}} propellant combination for future space vehicles based upon the Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS). The technology is estimated to have higher performance and lower overall systems mass compared to existing hypergolic propulsion systems. The current application considering this technology is the lunar <b>ascent</b> main <b>engine</b> (AME). AME is anticipated to be an expendable, pressure-fed <b>engine</b> to provide <b>ascent</b> from the moon {{at the completion of}} a 210 day lunar stay. The engine is expected to produce 5, 500 lbf (24, 465 N) thrust with variable inlet temperatures due to the cryogenic nature of the fuel and oxidizer. The primary technology risks include establishing reliable and robust ignition in vacuum conditions, maximizing specific impulse, developing rapid start capability for the descent abort, providing the capability for two starts and producing a total engine bum time over 500 seconds.
