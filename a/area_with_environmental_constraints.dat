A nonlinear programming model has been developed {{to assist in the}} management of open water dredged material disposal sites.

The optimization model considers available capacity of cells within the disposal area to produce a plan that minimizes mounding within the site.

Ultimately, the optimal dumping plans will be simulated for various stages of the dredging disposal cycle...|$|R
40|$|A demanda por água do setor agrícola vem crescendo a cada ano, bem como o aperfeiçoamento do manejo da irrigação. Ainda assim, em locais onde a água encontra-se escassa, os conflitos entre usos e usuários devido a disputas para acesso à água tendem a se intensificar. Na maioria das vezes esse problema está relacionado à ausência de cobertura florestal, levando, por vezes, a problemas socioambientais. Nesse contexto, a pesquisa buscou avaliar o impacto da implantação de sistemas agroflorestais (SAF’s) irrigados na condição hídrica local (de escassez), estabelecendo-se estratégias que os torne atrativos ambientalsocial- e economicamente. Assim, por meio de simulação computacional, alternativas de consórcios agroflorestais foram avaliadas, tomando-se como referência uma região piloto, típica da agricultura espírito-santense, constituída por pequenas propriedades agrícolas de base familiar, inseridas parcialmente em APPs. As espécies banana, pupunha e goiaba foram selecionadas para compor os cenários agroflorestais. Os resultados da pesquisa mostram que os SAF’s irrigados são uma alternativa no sentido de minimizar os conflitos por demandas de água em regiões de escassez hídrica, com a redução de tais demandas o comprometimento de rendimentos financeiros. Além disso, os SAF’s são alternativas para diversificação da renda e para tentar controlar a sazonalidade dos preços de mercado. The {{output of}} the {{agricultural}} sector has been growing every year, which has also led to increased demand for water {{as well as the}} improvement of irrigation management. In places where water is scarce, conflicts between uses and users over disputes to access to water tend to intensify. In some situations, the development of agricultural production occurs in regions with low forest and / or coverage in <b>areas</b> <b>with</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>constraints,</b> such as permanent preservation. In both cases the increase in forest cover will contribute to improving local water availability, and may lead to other environmental benefits. In this context, the research sought to evaluate the impact of implementation of irrigated agroforestry systems on the local water conditions (scarcity), establishing strategies that make them attractive environmental - and social - economically. To ground the research, were raised reviewed / discussed key topics such as water resources management, policy integration, agroforestry systems, computational simulation and environmental management of agricultural property. Thus, through computer simulation, alternative agroforestry systems were evaluated, taking as reference pilot region, typical of the spirit Santo's agriculture, consisting of small farms, family- based, partially inserted in PPAs. The research results show that the irrigated agroforestry systems are a promising alternative to minimize conflicts over water demands in water deficit regions, without compromising financial income. Other environmental benefits are are even mentioned. Finally, some technical recommendations were made, aiming to educate producers and agricultural and environmental managers, as well as recommendations for future researchCAPE...|$|R

However, manual configuration is becoming unrealistic, given the scale on which communications occur.

40|$|Summary. Recent {{insights}} into human grasping show that humans exploit con-straints to reduce uncertainty and reject disturbances during grasping. We propose to transfer this principle to robots and build robust and reliable grasping strategies from interactions <b>with</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>constraints.</b> To make implementation easy, hand hardware has to provide compliance, low inertia, low reaction delays and ro-bustness to collision. Pneumatic continuum actuators such as PneuFlex actuators provide these properties. Additionally {{they are easy}} to customize and cheap to man-ufacture. We present an anthropomorphic hand built with PneuFlex actuators and demonstrate the ease of implementing a robust multi-stage grasping strategy relying on <b>environmental</b> <b>constraints.</b> Humans are very proficient graspers. In fact, humans grasp so reliably and ro-bustly that experimenters usually assess grasp difficulty by execution speed instead of error rate. For autonomous robots, on the other hand, comparably robust and reliable grasping and manipulation remains an open challenge, despite well estab-lished theories for assessing the quality of a grasp [Prattichizzo and Trinkle, 2008...|$|R

Plasticity in web design is hypothesised to be important for spiders building in habitats where environmental conditions cause considerable web damage.

We found a notable lack of differences in web geometry, orientation and inclination between webs built along an exposed forest edge and those built inside the forest, despite marked differences in wind speed. This suggests that M. mengei did not exhibit web- building plasticity in response to wind in the field, contrasting with the findings of laboratory studies on other species of orb spiders. Instead, differences in prey capture and wind damage trade-offs between habitats may provide an explanation for our results, indicating that different species employ different strategies to cope <b>with</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>constraints...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{aim of this}} {{position}} paper is to consider the decision-making process {{as an integral part}} of goal-directed behaviour influenced by functional constraints at the scale of the environment-athlete relationship. To achieve this aim we discuss relevant theoretical ideas from ecological psychology, focusing particularly on ecological dynamics, as a contrast to more traditional perspectives on decision making behaviour. To support the argumentation we briefly describe some recent empirical data from studies of sports that emphasize this alternative perspective on decision making. We conclude that traditional approaches analyse decisions as if they were not grounded, i. e., expressed behaviourally through actions in performance contexts. It is argued that an ecological approach should analyse affordances or action possibilities, when studying cognition in sport, demanding an integration of theories and ideas from the natural sciences in order to understand concepts like information and intentionality. Conclusion: Decision-making behaviour is best considered at the level of the performer-environment relationship and viewed as emerging from the interactions of individuals <b>with</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>constraints</b> over time towards specific functional goals.

40|$|Genetic {{circuits}} {{that regulate}} distinct cellular processes can {{differ in their}} wiring pattern of interactions (architecture) and susceptibility to stochastic fluctuations (noise). Whether the link between circuit architecture and noise is of biological importance remains, however, poorly understood. To investigate this problem, we performed a computational study of gene expression noise for all possible circuit architectures of feed-forward loop (FFL) motifs. Results revealed that FFL architectures fall into two categories depending on whether their ON (stimulated) or OFF (unstimulated) steady states exhibit noise. To explore the biological importance of this difference in noise behavior, we analyzed 858 documented FFLs in Escherichia coli that were divided into 39 functional categories. The majority of FFLs were found to regulate two subsets of functional categories. Interestingly, these two functional categories associated with FFLs of opposite noise behaviors. This opposite noise preference revealed two noise-based strategies to cope <b>with</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>constraints</b> where cellular responses are either initiated or terminated stochastically to allow probabilistic sampling of alternative states. FFLs may thus be selected for their architecture-dependent noise behavior, revealing a biological role for noise that is encoded in gene circuit architectures...|$|R

40|$|The causal {{structure}} of Darwinian evolution {{by natural selection}} is investigated. Its basic scheme is reproduction resulting from a feedback loop driven by internal and external causes. Causation internal to the loop connects genotype, development, phenotype, and fitness, <b>with</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>constraints</b> on the latter preventing runaway reproduction. External causes driving the core loop are environmental change and genetic change (mutation, used broadly as including recombination and other mechanisms). This basic causal structure is complicated by modern additions such as control of mutation rate, niche construction, interactions between evolution and development, and epigenetic effects. In this article {{it is argued that}} at least one of these additions, control of mutation rate, produces an additional feedback loop incorporating a continual, targeted modulation of stochasticity, and thereby produces an unusual form of causation. This form of causation entangles deterministic and stochastic causation in such a way that it imposes, in effect, an active, goal-driven role on the organisms in a line of descent. The goal is defined by the factor driving the stochasticity, which must be regarded as an intrinsic estimate made implicitly by the organism of its own fitness. The estimator itself is an evolved property of the organism, and is aligned with the apparent (not real, post hoc) goal-directedness of natural selection...|$|R
