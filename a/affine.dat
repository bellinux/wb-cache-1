40|$|<b>Affines</b> (or "in-laws") {{have long}} been {{recognized}} within anthropology as {{a special kind of}} kin. Evolutionary biology, in contrast, has typically treated <b>affines</b> as though they were unrelated: only direct genetic kinship counts. However, Hughes (1988) argued that Hamilton's concept of inclusive fitness naturally includes affinal kin as kin because true kin and their <b>affines</b> share genetic interests in future generations. We test this proposal by asking whether affinal relatives are treated more like biological kin or unrelated friends in terms of perceived emotional closeness. We show for a sample of contemporary Belgians that <b>affines</b> are indeed treated {{more or less the same}} as biological kin of similar nominal relatedness and not at all like unrelated friends. These findings suggest that Hughes was right in his reinterpretation of Hamilton and that affinal kinship needs to be considered in biological studies of human kinship. © 2011 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} certain closed subvarieties {{of the flag}} variety, known as Hessenberg varieties. We prove that Hessenberg varieties corresponding to nilpotent elements which are regular in a Levi factor are paved by <b>affines.</b> We provide a partial reduction from paving Hessenberg varieties for arbitrary elements to paving those corresponding to nilpotent elements. As a consequence, we generalize results of Tymoczko asserting that Hessenberg varieties for regular nilpotent and arbitrary elements of gln(C) are paved by <b>affines.</b> For example, our results prove that any Hessenberg variety corresponding to a regular element is paved by <b>affines.</b> As a corollary, in all these cases the Hessenberg variety has no odd dimensional cohomology...|$|R

25|$|On any {{manifold}} {{of positive}} dimension there are infinitely many <b>affine</b> connections. If the manifold is further endowed with a Riemannian metric {{then there is}} a natural choice of <b>affine</b> connection, called the Levi-Civita connection. The choice of an <b>affine</b> connection is equivalent to prescribing a way of differentiating vector fields which satisfies several reasonable properties (linearity and the Leibniz rule). This yields a possible definition of an <b>affine</b> connection as a covariant derivative or (linear) connection on the tangent bundle. A choice of <b>affine</b> connection is also equivalent to a notion of parallel transport, which is a method for transporting tangent vectors along curves. This also defines a parallel transport on the frame bundle. Infinitesimal parallel transport in the frame bundle yields another description of an <b>affine</b> connection, either as a Cartan connection for the <b>affine</b> group or as a principal connection on the frame bundle.|$|E
