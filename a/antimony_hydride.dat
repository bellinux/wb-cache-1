40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma thesis was to {{optimize}} in detail atomization conditions for <b>antimony</b> <b>hydride</b> in a novel plasma atomizer based on a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) with atomic absorption spetrometric detection. Argon was found as the best DBD discharge gas employing a flow rate of 50 ml min- 1 Ar while the DBD power was optimized at 30 W. Analytical figures of merit including interference study of As, Se and Bi have been subsequently investigated and the results compared {{to those found in}} an externally heated quartz tube atomizer (QTA). The limit of detection reached in DBD (0. 15 ng ml- 1 Sb) is comparable to that observed in QTA (0. 14 ng ml- 1 Sb). Finally, possibility of stibane preconcentration in a DBD atomizer was studied. Preconcentration efficiency of 102 ± 6 % was found under optimized conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{presented}} bachelor {{thesis is}} to study the possibilities of the electrochemical hydride generation of volatile <b>antimony</b> <b>hydride,</b> using two newly constructed electrolytic cells. In this work, {{the properties of the}} cells were studied and consequently the basic characteristics of antimony determination obtained using new cells were compared with the chemical hydride generation method. At the beginning of the work, the relevant working parameters of both electrolytic cells were optimized. Under the optimal working conditions the calibration and other characteristics were carried out for antimony determination. Using the electrochemical hydride generation with thin-layer electrolytic cell and tubular cell and chemical hydride generation the sensitivity 3. 40 · 10 - 3 l·μg- 1, 6. 10 · 10 - 3 l·μg- 1 and 2. 10 · 10 - 3 l·μg- 1 respectively were obtained. Finally, the influence of oxygen introduction in the different part of experimental setup was studied. This oxygen addition caused the characteristic and well-reproducible absorption peak.

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{method was}} {{developed}} for determination of total antimony in hair samples from patients undergoing chemotherapy against Leishmaniasis based on the administration of pentavalent antimonial drugs. The method is based on microwave assisted digestion of the samples in a pressurized system, reduction of Sb 5 + to Sb 3 + with KI solution (10 % w/v) in ascorbic acid (2 %, w/v) and its subsequent determination by hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry (HG-AFS). The proportions of each component (HCl, HNO 3 and water) used in the digestion were studied applying a constrained mixtures design. The optimal proportions found were 50 % water, 25 % HNO 3 and 25 % HCl. Variables involved in the generation of <b>antimony</b> <b>hydride</b> were optimized using a Doehlert design revealing that good sensitivity is found when using 2. 0 % w/v NaBH 4 and 4. 4 mol L- 1 HCl. Under the optimum experimental conditions, the method allows the determination of antimony in hair samples with detection and quantification limits of 1. 4 and 4. 6 ng g- 1, respectively, and precision expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD) of 2. 8 % (n = 10 to 10. 0 mg L- 1). The developed method was applied {{in the analysis of}} hair samples from patients who take medication against Leishmaniasis...|$|E
40|$|The {{semimetal}} antimony (Sb) element doped into hydrogen {{has been}} performed theoretically to explored high-pressure crystal structure and superconductivity of <b>antimony</b> <b>hydrides.</b> The unexpected stoichiometry SbH_ 4 with P 6 _ 3 /mmc symmetry {{is found to}} have most negative enthalpy and embody the coexistence of covalent and ionic bonds. It is a metallic phase and stable in the pressure ranges of 127 - 300 GPa. Furthermore, a superconducting critical temperature (T_c) of 106 K is obtained at 150 GPa by employing the Allen-Dynes modified McMillan equation. In addition, an extrusive distinguishing feature {{is the presence of}} soft phonon modes, which is primary contribution to the strength of electron-phonon coupling.

40|$|Interference {{effects of}} co-generated <b>hydrides</b> of arsenic, <b>antimony,</b> bismuth and {{selenium}} on trapping behavior of selenium or <b>antimony</b> <b>hydrides</b> (analytes) within iridium modified, transversely heated graphite tube atomizer (THGA) was investigated. A twin-channel hydride generation system {{was used for}} independent separate generation and introduction of analyte and interferent hydrides, i. e. in simultaneous and/or sequential analyte-interferent and interferent-analyte mode of operation. Influence of the analyte and modifier mass, interferent amount, trapping temperature and composition of the gaseous phase was studied. A simple approach for elimination of mutual interference effects by modification of the gaseous phase with oxygen in substoichiometric ratio to chemically generated hydrogen is proposed and suppression of these interference effects is demonstrated. A hypothesis on mechanism of trapping and mutual interference effects is drawn...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the study of {{different}} interfering elements during <b>antimony</b> electrochemical <b>hydride</b> generation. Interferences were studied for electrochemical hydride generation with electrolytic cell and also for chemical hydride generation using sodium tetrahydroborate as a reduction agent. The study included the comparison with oxygen influences. Hydride-forming elements (selenium and arsenic), transition metals (zinc, copper and nickel), different anions (chlorides, sulfates and nitrates) and sodium were tested as interferents. The most serious interferents were hydride-forming elements and nickel, where 100 % signal supression was observed in high interferent concentrations. As opposed to sodium and nickel, where almost none signal supression was observed at all concentrations.
