25|$|While current {{technology}} is very effective at detecting smoke and fire conditions, the deaf and {{hard of hearing}} community has raised concerns {{about the effectiveness of}} the alerting function in awakening sleeping individuals in certain high-risk groups such as the elderly, those with hearing loss and those who are intoxicated. Between 2005 and 2007 research sponsored by the United States' National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) focused on understanding the cause of the higher number of deaths in such high-risk groups. Initial research into the effectiveness of the various alerting methods is sparse. Research findings suggest that a low frequency (520Hz) square wave output is significantly more effective at awakening high risk individuals. Wireless smoke and carbon monoxide detectors linked to <b>alert</b> <b>mechanisms</b> such as vibrating pillow pads for the hearing impaired, strobes, and remote warning handsets are more effective at waking people with serious hearing loss than other alarms.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{deal with}} micro-mobility in TWINBOARD network, which is a two nodes mobile network {{architecture}} based on an all IP infrastructure. The two nodes are the Base Station (BS) and the Access Gateway (AG). To manage micro-mobility, we propose a new approach providing efficient and smooth handover, while being able to coexist and inter-operate with exist-ing technologies. Specifically, we propose an intra-domain multicast-based handover approach combined with an <b>Alert</b> <b>mechanism.</b> <b>Alert</b> approach is a distributed mecha-nism that provides routers with information regarding the congestion state of other routers without any modifications on existing routing protocol. Our solution achieves an efficient intra-domain handover and avoids flooding in the network. The simulations used to evaluate our scheme and compare it to other multicast scheme- DVMRP (Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol) show that our solution presents a good performance and outperforms DVMRP scheme. Our main contribution consists on an efficient new approach to manage IP micro-mobility using intra-domain multicast with <b>alert</b> <b>mechanism...</b>|$|R

30|$|All {{institutions}} {{have an obligation}} to encourage and promote safe practice. Additional radiology report <b>alert</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are a safety feature, but these incur extra costs.

30|$|One {{major concern}} of radiologists is that referrers {{will rely on}} <b>alert</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> {{especially}} alerts attached to electronic reports, and assume that the other reports are normal or have no significant findings; a practice or assumption which could be hazardous. It is indeed possible to adopt a policy where all investigations showing any abnormality, however minor, are flagged and only normal reports unflagged, or vice versa. This goes beyond the enhanced communication systems suggested above.|$|E

The objective of the multi-agent system is to provide a set of alert/notification mechanisms for the clinicians, helping them to classify the clinical condition of each patient. Therefore, despite the huge amount of data managed by the system, due to the daily use of the contact center's services, these <b>alert</b> <b>mechanisms</b> provide the clinician with an overview of the cases that need further examination and save him/her time from the trivial cases. The multi-agent system consists of different types of agents, each one assigned with specific tasks, which communicate with each other, in order to share knowledge...|$|E

30|$|Overall, {{this project}} helped improve our {{understanding}} of submersible areas and create maps of critical vulnerability, both material and human. It also revealed the poor social representation of marine submersion risk, {{as well as a}} clear lack of awareness of crisis management systems and tools, and of behaviors that should be adopted {{in the event of a}} flood. These findings highlight the need for setting up a communication strategy, to raise awareness of risk and inform the population of current <b>alert</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The crisis exercise conducted in March 2016 with relevant municipal departments showed the importance of creating such exercises working from a realistic scenario, to ensure that all staff in positions of responsibility are aware of procedures, but also to detect any potential gaps in the contents of the PCS. In a context where hazard and vulnerability are bound to become more extreme, this should be a key action in the necessary optimization of crisis management systems and procedures.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: With {{the ever}} {{increasing}} size {{and number of}} networks around the world, the network traffic increases even more. The pace at which such an increase is observed, gives a rise to the need of Intrusion Detection exponentially. Under such circumstances, data is vulnerable to its maximum capacity. Intrusion Detection is required to safeguard the public servers from unauthorized access. Filtering of unauthorized access attempts whilst maintaining low latency {{in order not to}} interfere and compromise network capacity and bandwidth has become a cause of major concern. Implementation of Intrusion Detection system thus comes into play. It segregates the traffic from authenticated clients and attackers or intruders, while simultaneously ceding the issues of latency, security, bandwidth and throughput of the network. The ever increasing types of computer attacks are getting more and more difficult to identify. Hence the use of honeypots may provide an effective and reliable solution to Intrusion Detection and <b>Alert</b> <b>mechanisms...</b>|$|E

Efficient management of patient flows for ED services has become an urgent issue for most hospital administrations. Handling and detection of abnormal situations is a key challenge in EDs.

40|$|Quick and {{efficient}} response to emergency {{is important for}} every city. This depends {{on the quality of}} the dispatch of emergency service to the scene and back to hospital or other governmental offices. To provide the path of the shortest traveling time is a difficult task, especially if there is traffic jam near the scene. In this paper, we formulate a conceptual model for the transport network and Emergency Route Advisory System (ERAS) implementation architecture handle the emergency response. The ERAS requires information integration from various governmental departments and public services through Web services, such as maintaining the databases of transportation information and traffic condition. Making use of such information, a challenge is to find a time-efficient or cost-effective path intelligently. Our ERAS interacts with the call centers of emergency service departments (such as the police, fire services, and ambulances) through <b>alert</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to integrate emergency processes.
