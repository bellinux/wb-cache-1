5000|$|To {{solve the}} paradox we say: {{we should not}} concede that if it is false then one of his {{sentences}} (kalām) is true.

5|$|As {{outlined}} in the 3,500-word Nichols letter, the hearing focused on 24 allegations, 23 of which dealt with Oppenheimer's Communist and left-wing affiliations between 1938 and 1946, including his delayed <b>and</b> <b>false</b> reporting of the Chevalier incident to authorities. The twenty-fourth charge related to {{his opposition to the}} hydrogen bomb. By including the hydrogen bomb, the AEC changed the character of the hearing, by opening up an inquiry into his activities as a postwar government adviser.|$|E

50|$|At any time, if P→Q is true, {{it can be}} {{replaced}} by P→(P∧Q). One possible case for P→Q is for P to be true and Q to be true; thus P∧Q is also true, and P→(P∧Q) is true. Another possible case sets P as <b>false</b> <b>and</b> Q as true. Thus, P∧Q is <b>false</b> <b>and</b> P→(P∧Q) is false; false→false is true. The last case occurs when both P <b>and</b> Q are <b>false.</b> Thus, P∧Q is <b>false</b> <b>and</b> P→(P∧Q) is true.|$|R
5|$|Self-awareness {{appears to}} be a sign of {{abstract}} thinking. Self-awareness, although not well-defined, is believed to be a precursor to more advanced processes such as metacognitive reasoning. The traditional method for measuring this is the mirror test, which determines if an animal possesses the ability of self-recognition. Mammals that have 'passed' the mirror test include Asian elephants (some pass, some do not); chimpanzees; bonobos; orangutans; humans, from 18 months (mirror stage); bottlenose dolphins killer whales; <b>and</b> <b>false</b> killer whales.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises (genus Nycticebus) are strepsirrhine {{primates}} and {{are related}} to other living lorisoids, such as slender lorises (Loris), pottos (Perodicticus), false pottos (Pseudopotto), angwantibos (Arctocebus), and galagos (family Galagidae), and to the lemurs of Madagascar. They are most {{closely related to the}} slender lorises of South Asia, followed by the angwantibos, pottos <b>and</b> <b>false</b> pottos of Central and West Africa. Lorisoids are thought to have evolved in Africa, where most living species occur; later, one group may have migrated to Asia and evolved into the slender and slow lorises of today.|$|E

Its palaces are distinctive for their false-tower decorations, lacking interior rooms, with steep, almost vertical, stairways <b>and</b> <b>false</b> doors. These towers were adorned with deity masks, and were built to impress the viewer, rather than serve any practical function. Such false towers are only found in the Río Bec region.

5|$|Tornado myths are {{incorrect}} {{beliefs about}} tornadoes, {{which can be}} attributed to many factors, including stories and news reports told by people unfamiliar with tornadoes, sensationalism by news media, and the presentation of incorrect information in popular entertainment.

5|$|A {{few days}} later, the sheriff of St. George, {{accompanied}} by a posse of 30 men, arrested 25 members of the Miners Union, including Matthew O'Loughlin. As Silver Reef's jail {{was too small to}} hold all 25 prisoners, most of them were jailed in the Rice Building. The Rice Building could not hold all of the prisoners, so a line was drawn around the building, and anyone who crossed the line was threatened with shooting. The Miners Union members were transferred to Beaver, where they were tried for riot, conspiracy, <b>and</b> <b>false</b> imprisonment. Thirteen of the members were sentenced to imprisonment; three were bailed out, while ten were sent to the Utah Territorial Penitentiary. Matthew O'Loughlin was sentenced to twenty days in prison and was charged a $75 fine.|$|E
5|$|Connoisseurship in {{the late}} Ming period {{centered}} on these items of refined artistic taste, which provided work for art dealers and even underground scammers who themselves made imitations <b>and</b> <b>false</b> attributions. The Jesuit Matteo Ricci while staying in Nanjing wrote that Chinese scam artists were ingenious at making forgeries and huge profits. However, there were guides to help the wary new connoisseur; Liu Tong (died 1637) wrote a book printed in 1635 that told his readers how to spot fake and authentic pieces of art. He revealed that a Xuande era (1426–1435) bronzework could be authenticated by judging its sheen; porcelain wares from the Yongle era (1402–1424) could be judged authentic by their thickness.|$|E
5|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} is {{not common}} in the breed, although it occurs sufficiently often for many breeders to have their breeding stock tested. The Cattle Dog {{has a number of}} inherited conditions, but most of these are not common. Hereditary polioencephalomyelopathy of the Australian Cattle Dog is a very rare condition caused by an inherited biochemical defect. Dogs identified with the condition were completely paralysed within their first year. Based on a sample of 69 still-living dogs, the most common health issues noted by owners were musculoskeletal (spondylosis, elbow dysplasia, and arthritis) and reproductive (pyometra, infertility, <b>and</b> <b>false</b> pregnancy), and blindness. A study of dogs diagnosed at Veterinary Colleges in the United States and Canada over a thirty-year period described fractures, lameness and cruciate ligament tears as the most common conditions in the Australian Cattle Dogs treated.|$|E
