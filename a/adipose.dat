5|$|Miss Foster accelerates her plans, {{knowing that}} the Doctor will attempt to stop her. Throughout London, the <b>Adipose</b> begin to spawn and soon number several thousand. The Doctor and Donna prevent total {{emergency}} parthenogenesis occurring, which would have killed those who had taken the pill, and {{the remainder of the}} young <b>Adipose</b> make their way to <b>Adipose</b> Industries. The Adiposian First Family arrive in a spaceship and begin collecting their young. The Doctor tries to warn Miss Foster about her safety, but she disregards him and is killed when the <b>Adipose</b> drop her from their transport beam to her death, to cover their unsanctioned colonization efforts. The Doctor refrains from killing the young <b>Adipose</b> because they are children, to which Donna remarks that his previous companion Martha Jones made him more human.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor and Donna, {{neither one}} {{aware of the}} other's involvement, both {{investigate}} <b>Adipose</b> Industries, which is marketing a special diet pill {{to the people of}} London. They find that the pill's slogan, The Fat Just Walks Away, is literal. The pills use latent body fat to parthenogenetically create small white aliens called <b>Adipose</b> that spawn at night and leave the host's body. The Doctor and Donna separately infiltrate the offices of <b>Adipose</b> Industries, each unaware that the other is there. Donna hides out in a toilet cubicle until they close, the Doctor stays in a storage room. As they explore the building, they suddenly encounter each other through opposite windows in an office. They are confronted by Miss Foster, an alien who is using Britain's overweight population to create the <b>Adipose</b> babies for the Adiposian First Family. Miss Foster pursues the Doctor and Donna around the building, finally catching them in an office. She tells the Doctor that the <b>Adipose</b> lost their breeding planet and hired Miss Foster to find a replacement. The Doctor uses Miss Foster's sonic pen and his sonic screwdriver to create a diversion and escape.|$|E
5|$|The <b>adipose</b> fin, {{which is}} present in over 6,000 teleost species, is often thought to have evolved once in the lineage and to have been lost {{multiple}} times due to its limited function. A 2014 study challenges this idea and suggests that the <b>adipose</b> fin {{is an example of}} convergent evolution. In Characiformes, the <b>adipose</b> fin develops from an outgrowth after the reduction of the larval fin fold, while in Salmoniformes, the fin appears to be a remnant of the fold.|$|E
5|$|Conditions of the {{subcutaneous}} fat are those affecting {{the layer of}} <b>adipose</b> tissue that lies between the dermis and underlying fascia.|$|E
5|$|During Pointman I, {{commission}} researchers devised ways {{to determine}} small dioxin levels in blood. Prior to this, such levels {{could only be}} found in the <b>adipose</b> (fat) tissue. The project studied dioxin (TCDD) levels in blood as well as in <b>adipose</b> tissue in a small group of Vietnam veterans who had been exposed to Agent Orange and compared them to those of a matched control group; the levels were found to be higher in the former group.|$|E
5|$|The episode's alien creatures, the <b>Adipose,</b> {{were created}} using the {{software}} MASSIVE, commonly used for crowd sequences in fantasy and science fiction films.|$|E
5|$|Under certain conditions, protons can {{re-enter}} the mitochondrial matrix without {{contributing to}} ATP synthesis. This process {{is known as}} proton leak or mitochondrial uncoupling and {{is due to the}} facilitated diffusion of protons into the matrix. The process results in the unharnessed potential energy of the proton electrochemical gradient being released as heat. The process is mediated by a proton channel called thermogenin, or UCP1. Thermogenin is a 33 kDa protein first discovered in 1973. Thermogenin is primarily found in brown <b>adipose</b> tissue, or brown fat, and is responsible for non-shivering thermogenesis. Brown <b>adipose</b> tissue is found in mammals, and is at its highest levels in early life and in hibernating animals. In humans, brown <b>adipose</b> tissue is present at birth and decreases with age.|$|E
5|$|Exterior {{shots of}} <b>Adipose</b> Industries were filmed at the British Gas {{building}} (Helmont House) in Cardiff's city centre. For {{health and safety}} reasons, Tennant was prohibited from performing his own stunts in the window cleaning platform. His only shot that required stunts was when he catches Miss Foster's sonic pen, a shot that took several takes to perfect.|$|E
5|$|Not all inhibitors of {{oxidative}} phosphorylation are toxins. In brown <b>adipose</b> tissue, regulated proton channels called uncoupling proteins can uncouple respiration from ATP synthesis. This rapid respiration produces heat, and {{is particularly important}} {{as a way of}} maintaining body temperature for hibernating animals, although these proteins may also have a more general function in cells' responses to stress.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene where}} Donna and the Doctor {{investigate}} <b>Adipose</b> {{was difficult to}} film. The scene took thirty shots to complete, and Tennant and Tate experienced problems avoiding each other on-screen. The scene was filmed in Picture Finance's call centre {{on the outskirts of}} Newport on an early Sunday morning, with the company's telephonists serving as extras.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians {{possess a}} pancreas, liver and gall bladder. The liver is usually large with two lobes. Its size is {{determined}} by its function as a glycogen and fat storage unit, and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up. <b>Adipose</b> tissue is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen (in internal structures called fat bodies), under the skin and, in some salamanders, in the tail.|$|E
5|$|The blunted {{ventilatory}} {{response is}} attributed to several factors. Obese people tend to have raised levels of the hormone leptin, which is secreted by <b>adipose</b> tissue and under normal circumstances increases ventilation. In OHS, this effect is reduced. Furthermore, episodes of nighttime acidosis (e.g. due to sleep apnea) lead to compensation by the kidneys with retention of the alkali bicarbonate. This normalizes the acidity of the blood. However, bicarbonate stays around in the bloodstream for longer, and further episodes of hypercapnia lead to relatively mild acidosis and reduced ventilatory response in a vicious circle.|$|E
5|$|The thrifty gene {{hypothesis}} postulates that, due to dietary scarcity during human evolution, {{people are}} prone to obesity. Their ability {{to take advantage of}} rare periods of abundance by storing energy as fat would be advantageous during times of varying food availability, and individuals with greater <b>adipose</b> reserves {{would be more likely to}} survive famine. This tendency to store fat, however, would be maladaptive in societies with stable food supplies. This theory has received various criticisms, and other evolutionarily-based theories such as the drifty gene hypothesis and the thrifty phenotype hypothesis have also been proposed.|$|E
5|$|Triglycerides, {{stored in}} <b>adipose</b> tissue, {{are a major}} form of energy storage both in animals and plants. The adipocyte, or fat cell, is {{designed}} for continuous synthesis and breakdown of triglycerides in animals, with breakdown controlled mainly by the activation of hormone-sensitive enzyme lipase. The complete oxidation of fatty acids provides high caloric content, about 9kcal/g, compared with 4kcal/g for the breakdown of carbohydrates and proteins. Migratory birds that must fly long distances without eating use stored energy of triglycerides to fuel their flights.|$|E
5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of {{a single piece of}} elastic cartilage with a complicated relief on its inner surface and a fairly smooth configuration on its posterior surface. A tubercle, known as Darwin's tubercle, is sometimes present, lying in the descending part of the helix and corresponding to the ear-tip of mammals. The earlobe {{consists of}} areola and <b>adipose</b> tissue. The symmetrical arrangement of the two ears allows for the localisation of sound. The brain accomplishes this by comparing arrival-times and intensities from each ear, in circuits located in the superior olivary complex and the trapezoid bodies which are connected via pathways to both ears.|$|E
5|$|Together with turtles, the tuatara has {{the most}} {{primitive}} hearing organs among the amniotes. There is no eardrum and no earhole, and the middle ear cavity is filled with loose tissue, mostly <b>adipose</b> (fatty) tissue. The stapes comes {{into contact with the}} quadrate (which is immovable), as well as the hyoid and squamosal. The hair cells are unspecialized, innervated by both afferent and efferent nerve fibres, and respond only to low frequencies. Though the hearing organs are poorly developed and primitive with no visible external ears, they can still show a frequency response from 100 to 800Hz, with peak sensitivity of 40dB at 200Hz.|$|E
25|$|Fatty Tissue. In Biology, <b>adipose</b> tissue (/ˈædəˌpoʊs/) or {{body fat}} or fat depot or just fat is loose {{connective}} tissue composed of adipocytes. It is technically composed of roughly only 80% fat; fat in its solitary state {{exists in the}} liver and muscles. <b>Adipose</b> tissue is derived from lipoblasts. Its main role is to store {{energy in the form}} of lipids, although it also cushions and insulates the body. Far from hormonally inert, <b>adipose</b> tissue has in recent years been recognized as a major endocrine organ, as it produces hormones such as leptin, resistin, and the cytokine TNFα. Moreover, <b>adipose</b> tissue can affect other organ systems of the body and may lead to disease. Obesity or being overweight in humans and most animals does not depend on body weight but on the amount of body fat—to be specific, <b>adipose</b> tissue. Two types of <b>adipose</b> tissue exist: white <b>adipose</b> tissue (WAT) and brown <b>adipose</b> tissue (BAT). The formation of <b>adipose</b> tissue appears to be controlled in part by the <b>adipose</b> gene. <b>Adipose</b> tissue was first identified by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner in 1551.|$|E
25|$|Until recently, brown <b>adipose</b> tissue {{was thought}} to be {{primarily}} limited to infants in humans, but new evidence has now overturned that belief. Metabolically active tissue with temperature responses similar to brown <b>adipose</b> was first reported in the neck and trunk of some human adults in 2007, and the presence of brown <b>adipose</b> in human adults was later verified histologically in the same anatomical regions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adipose</b> tissue has a {{density of}} ~0.9g/ml. Thus, {{a person with}} more <b>adipose</b> tissue will float more easily than a person of the same weight with more muscular tissue, since muscular tissue has a density of 1.06g/ml.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adipose</b> tissues also secrete {{a type of}} cytokines (cell-to-cell {{signalling}} proteins) called adipokines (adipocytokines), which {{play a role in}} obesity-associated complications. Perivascular <b>adipose</b> tissue releases adipokines such as adiponectin {{that affect}} the contractile function of the vessels that they surround.|$|E
25|$|Lipolysis in <b>adipose</b> tissue.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adipose</b> tissue {{possesses}} aromatase, {{an enzyme}} that converts androstenedione to estrone and testosterone to estradiol. The excess of <b>adipose</b> tissue in obese women creates {{the paradox of}} having both excess androgens (which are responsible for hirsutism and virilization) and estrogens (which inhibits FSH via negative feedback).|$|E
25|$|<b>Adipose</b> tissue (lipid cells), which {{requires}} extraction by liposuction.|$|E
25|$|Very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) carry (newly synthesised) {{triglycerides}} {{from the}} liver to <b>adipose</b> tissue.|$|E
25|$|Subcutaneous <b>adipose</b> tissue regenerates {{cortisol}} from cortisone by {{the enzyme}} 11-beta HSD1.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{constant}} flux of FFA (Free Fatty Acids) entering and leaving <b>adipose</b> tissue. The net direction of this flux is controlled by insulin and leptin—if insulin is elevated, {{then there is a}} net inward flux of FFA, and only when insulin is low can FFA leave <b>adipose</b> tissue. Insulin secretion is stimulated by high blood sugar, which results from consuming carbohydrates.|$|E
25|$|Blubber – {{an extra}} thick form of <b>adipose</b> tissue {{found in some}} marine mammals.|$|E
25|$|Leptin is {{a protein}} hormone {{produced}} by <b>adipose</b> tissue. Its primary target organ is the hypothalamus. The leptin level seems {{to provide the}} brain a rough indicator of <b>adipose</b> mass for purposes of regulation of appetite and energy metabolism. It also plays a permissive role in female puberty, which usually will not proceed until an adequate body mass has been achieved.|$|E
25|$|Fat storage —marrow <b>adipose</b> tissue (MAT) acts as {{a storage}} reserve of fatty acids.|$|E
25|$|Chylomicrons carry {{triglycerides}} (fat) {{from the}} intestines to the liver, to skeletal muscle, and to <b>adipose</b> tissue.|$|E
25|$|Diazepam {{is highly}} lipid-soluble, and is widely {{distributed}} throughout the body after administration. It easily crosses both the blood–brain barrier and the placenta, and is excreted into breast milk. After absorption, diazepam is redistributed into muscle and <b>adipose</b> tissue. Continual daily doses of diazepam quickly build to a high concentration in the body (mainly in <b>adipose</b> tissue), far {{in excess of the}} actual dose for any given day.|$|E
25|$|The US Preventive Service Task Force {{reported}} {{that not all}} children with a high BMI need to lose weight though. High BMI can identify a possible weight problem, but does not differentiate between fat or lean tissue. Additionally, BMI may mistakenly rule out some children who do have excess <b>adipose</b> tissue. It is therefore beneficial to supplement the reliability of a BMI diagnosis with additional screening tools such as <b>adipose</b> tissue or skin fold measurements.|$|E
25|$|CYP19A (P450arom, aromatase) in {{endoplasmic}} reticulum of gonads, brain, <b>adipose</b> tissue, and elsewhere catalyzes aromatization of androgens to estrogens.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adipose</b> {{tissue is}} the {{greatest}} peripheral source of aromatase in both males and females, contributing {{to the production of}} estradiol.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>adipose</b> (fat) tissue changes slowly over months and years. HRT causes {{the body to}} accumulate new fat in a typically feminine pattern, including in the hips, thighs, buttocks, pubis, upper arms, and breasts. (Fat on the hips, thighs, and buttocks has a higher concentration of omega-3 fatty acids and {{is meant to be}} used for lactation.) The body begins to burn old <b>adipose</b> tissue in the waist, shoulders, and back, making those areas smaller.|$|E
25|$|Further effects include glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis from <b>adipose</b> {{tissue and}} liver, {{as well as}} {{secretion}} from sweat glands and Na+ reabsorption from kidney.|$|E
