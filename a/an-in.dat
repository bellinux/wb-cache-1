40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} issue of hybrid identity in Julia Alvarez’s novel How the Garcia Girls Lost their Accents (1991). The {{aim of the research}} is to identify the ways of hybrid identities of main characters are constructed in the novel and to observe how the main characters manifest their hybrid identities. The research employs the descriptive qualitative method in which the writer describes, interprets and analyzes the text to answer the research question. The concept of hybridity proposed by Homi Bhabha (1994) is used as the theoretical framework to analyze the data. Based on the data analysis, this research finds that hybrid identities of the main characters, the Garcia sisters, are constructed in <b>an-in</b> between space which is categorized into in-between past and present, and in-between Dominican and American cultures. Moreover, the research also finds that the Garcia sisters manifest their hybrid identity in three ways: adopting the American life, embracing American values and preserving Dominican cultures. Keywords: culture, immigrants, hybridity, hybrid identity, postcolonial criticism Penelitian ini meneliti tentang isu identitas hibrid dalam sebuah novel karya Julia Alvarez yang berjudul How the Garcia Girls Lost their Accents (1991). Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui bagaimana identitas hybrid yang dimiliki oleh karakter utama dalam novel tersebut dikonstruksi, dan bagaimana karakter utama menunjukkan identitas hybrid mereka. Penelitian ini menggunakan metode deskriptif kualitatif dimana penulis menjelaskan, menginterpretasikan dan menganalisa teks untuk menjawab pertanyaan penelitian. Konsep hibriditas oleh Homi Bhabha (1994) digunakan sebagai kerangka teori untuk menganalisa data. Berdasarkan analisis data, penelitian ini menemukan bahwa identitas hibrid para karakter utama, Garcia bersaudara, dikonstruksi dalam sebuah ruang in-between atau in-between space, yang kemudian dibagi menjadi in-between masa lalu dan masa sekarang (past and present), dan in-between budaya Amerika dan Dominika. Penelitian ini juga menemukan bahwa para karakter utama menunjukkan identitas hibrid mereka dengan tiga cara yaitu dengan mengadopsi kehidupan Amerika, memeluk nilai-nilai Amerika dan mempertahankan budaya Dominika.

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} students’ higher {{education}} choices have been mainly {{examined in the}} US, European and Australian context, with few related empirical research studies {{in the context of}} China (Hemsley-Brown and Oplatka, 2015). Although there is no lack of various online surveys about the reasons driving students towards postgraduate education in China, little is known about how far their decisions were shaped by their specific circumstances which is the purpose of this study, which investigates the main factors influencing students’ decision-making about postgraduate education at G University in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province. To achieve this aim, three main research questions were asked: what motivated students to undertake PG education, why did they choose their particular subjects for PG studies, and why did they choose G University as their place of study? This study employs <b>an-in</b> depth case study approach. The research was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, questionnaires were distributed among the first-year postgraduate students at G University to get a general idea of what motivated them to undertake PG education and why they chose their particular subjects and place of study. In the second stage, 30 students who indicated their willingness in the questionnaires to participate in follow-up interviews were interviewed to explore the responses to the questionnaires in greater depth. The findings of this research were analysed from the theoretical aspects of human, cultural and social capital, as well as the related Chinese concept of guanxi. The findings indicated that students’ decisions to undertake PG education was mainly to enhance their employment competitiveness and to gain jobs with higher salaries and better advancement opportunities. In addition, the findings indicated that personal interest influenced either by their family's education or school teacher’s instruction constituted the main reason for choosing their specific fields of study. The findings also showed that family social capital and the social capital formed in the school context exerted great influence on students’ choices of postgraduate education. Further, students chose G University as their place of study mainly for its academic reputation, the quality of its faculties and resources, and its convenient location. The data indicated that students’ choices of postgraduate education were influenced by their individual economic, social and cultural backgrounds, or the interplay between human, cultural and social capital from the theoretical aspect. Enquiring into the students’ choices of postgraduate education in the specific Chinese social and cultural context contributes to the literature on students’ choices of higher education. It is hoped that the findings will provide some informed knowledge for students who plan to invest in their future employability through postgraduate education in China, {{as well as for the}} Chinese further and higher education system, which may gain a better understanding of its students and so be able to provide a better service to them...|$|E

40|$|Objective—The goal of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of nonenzymatic glycation on the antiinflammatory properties of apolipoprotein (apo) A-I. Methods and Results—Rabbits were infused with saline, lipid-free apoA-I from normal subjects (apoA-IN), lipid-free apoA-I nonenzymatically glycated by incubation with methylglyoxal (apoA-IGlyc in vitro), nonenzymatically glycated lipid-free apoA-I from subjects with diabetes (apoA-IGlyc in vivo), discoidal reconstituted high-density lipoproteins (rHDL) containing phosphati-dylcholine and apoA-IN, (<b>A-IN)</b> rHDL, or apoA-IGlyc in vitro, (A-IGlyc in vitro) rHDL. At 24 hours postinfusion, acute vascular inflammation was induced by inserting a nonocclusive, periarterial carotid collar. The animals were euthanized 24 hours after the insertion of the collar. The collars caused intima/media neutrophil infiltration and increased endothelial expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1) and intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1). ApoA-IN infusion decreased neutrophil infiltration and VCAM- 1 and ICAM- 1 expression by 89 %, 90 %, and 66 %, respectively. The apoA-IGlyc in vitro infusion decreased neutrophil infiltration by 53 % but did not reduce VCAM- 1 or ICAM- 1 expression. ApoA-IGlyc in vivo did not inhibit neutrophil infiltration or adhesion molecule expression. (A-IGlyc in vitro) rHDL also inhibited vascular inflammation less effectively than (<b>A-IN)</b> rHDL. The reduced antiinflammatory properties of nonenzymatically glycated apoA-I were attributed to a reduced ability to inhibit nuclear factor-B activation and reactive oxygen species formation. Conclusion—Nonenzymatic glycation impairs the antiinflammatory properties of apoA-I. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol...|$|R

RT-PCR revealed the transcriptional expression of Tmem 16 a-encoded CaCCs in the myosalpinx. Intracellular microelectrode recordings were performed in the presence of two pharmacologically distinct Cl channel antagonists, anthracene- 9 -carboxylic acid and ni-flumic acid. Both of these inhibitors caused membrane hyperpo-larization, reduced the duration of slow waves, and ultimately inhibited pacemaker activity. Niflumic acid also inhibited propagating calcium waves within the myosalpinx. Slow waves were present at birth in wild-type and heterozygous oviducts but failed to develop by birth in mice homozygous for a null allele of Tmem 16 a (Tmem 16 atm 1 Bdh/tm 1 Bdh).

This in turn suggests that if an agent X-s “non-basically”, he X-s intentionally if and only if he does something else with the intention of thereby X-ing.

In order to explore the sub-editor's position in the news production chain, we take an ethnographic approach.

50|$|Nearly every melos {{is related}} to the heptaphonia by the {{reproduction}} of the plagios in the octave of the eighth phthongos. This practice separated the four octaves. Hence, the Hagiopolitan phthorai nana and nenano had an important function to bridge between the four octaves of protos, devteros, tritos, and tetartos. The tritos and the tetartos octave were separated by different degrees, e.g. the tetartos octave C—c and the tritos one B flat—b flat was separated by the use of b natural on the seventh phthongos in the heptaphonia of tetartos. Manuel Chrysaphes mentioned that phthora nana always bound the melos of echos tritos, so that it had to resolve in the enharmonic form of echos plagios tetartos. Bound by the phthora nana, the melos could not change into any other echos before its resolution into the plagios tetartos, so even a change to the diatonic tetartos melos had to follow after this resolution and needed a preparation by the change to another genos (μεταβολή κατὰ γένος). In a very similar way the phthora nenano always connected the echos plagios devteros on E with the echos protos on <b>a—in</b> both directions and bridged by the chromatic genos.|$|R
