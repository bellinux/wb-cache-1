5|$|Berg's {{observation}} of {{local high school}} students while preparing to film the movie inspired his development {{of some of the}} characters. For example, Jason Street, the character whose promising football career is ended by <b>a</b> <b>spinal</b> injury in the pilot, was inspired by a local event. David Edwards, a football player from San Antonio’s Madison High, was paralyzed during a November 2003 game. Berg was at the game when this accident occurred; he was profoundly affected by Edwards' injury and how it overturned his life. Berg set up a similar incident in the pilot.|$|E

5|$|Diagnosis of a {{cerebrospinal}} fluid leak is performed {{through a combination}} of measurement of the CSF pressure and a computed tomography myelogram (CTM) scan of the spinal column for fluid leaks. The opening fluid pressure in the spinal canal is obtained by performing a lumbar puncture, also known as <b>a</b> <b>spinal</b> tap. Once the pressure is measured, a radiocontrast agent is injected into the spinal fluid. The contrast then diffuses out through the dura sac before leaking through dural holes. This allows for a CTM with fluoroscopy to locate and image any sites of dura rupture via contrast seen outside the dura sac in the imagery.|$|E
5|$|In November 1951 Hank {{suffered}} a fall during a hunting trip with his fiddler Jerry Rivers in Franklin, Tennessee. The fall reactivated his old back pains. He later started to consume painkillers, including morphine, and alcohol {{to ease the}} pain. On May 21, he had been admitted to North Louisiana Sanitarium {{for the treatment of}} his alcoholism, leaving on May 24. On December 13, 1951 he had <b>a</b> <b>spinal</b> fusion at the Vanderbilt University Hospital, being released on December 24. During his recovery, he lived with his mother in Montgomery, and later moved to Nashville with Ray Price.|$|E

In the third season, Quinn intends to get full custody of her daughter, Beth, and her attempts to prove Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel)—the adoptive mother of Beth—an unfit mother fail; eventually, she realizes that Shelby is Beth's true mother. Quinn subsequently receives a college acceptance letter from Yale, and while driving to Finn and Rachel's wedding, her car is struck by a truck and she suffers <b>a</b> <b>spinal</b> injury that requires her to use a wheelchair for many weeks. She is eventually able to walk again.|$|E

5|$|Low {{back pain}} {{is not a}} {{specific}} disease but rather a complaint that {{may be caused by}} a large number of underlying problems of varying levels of seriousness. The majority of LBP does not have a clear cause but {{is believed to be the}} result of non-serious muscle or skeletal issues such as sprains or strains. Obesity, smoking, weight gain during pregnancy, stress, poor physical condition, poor posture and poor sleeping position may also contribute to low back pain. A full list of possible causes includes many less common conditions. Physical causes may include osteoarthritis, degeneration of the discs between the vertebrae or <b>a</b> <b>spinal</b> disc herniation, broken vertebra(e) (such as from osteoporosis) or, rarely, an infection or tumor of the spine.|$|E
5|$|Marcus Alonzo Hanna {{was born}} on September 24, 1837, in New Lisbon (in 1895 renamed Lisbon), Ohio, to Dr. Leonard and Samantha Hanna. Leonard's father, Benjamin Hanna, a Quaker of Scotch-Irish descent, was a wealthy store owner in New Lisbon. Dr. Hanna practiced in Columbiana County, where New Lisbon was located, until he {{suffered}} <b>a</b> <b>spinal</b> injury while riding. After the accident, he joined the family business, B., L., and T. Hanna, by now a major grocery and goods brokering firm. Samantha, née Converse, and her parents had journeyed west from Vermont when she was 11; she was of English, possibly Irish, and French Huguenot descent.|$|E
5|$|Outside of the Taylor family, {{the show}} explores {{the lives of}} the Dillon high school {{football}} players.

At first, Street struggles with these disabilities and the upturn of his life. Gradually, he copes with his new reality.

5|$|Their coat differs geographically, with elands {{in north}} Africa having {{distinctive}} markings (torso stripes, markings on legs, dark garters and <b>a</b> <b>spinal</b> crest) that are absent in the south. Apart from a rough mane, the coat is smooth. Females have a tan coat, while the coats of males are darker, with a bluish-grey tinge. Bulls {{may also have}} a series of vertical white stripes on their sides (mainly in parts of the Karoo in South Africa). As males age, their coat becomes more grey. Males also have dense fur on their foreheads and a large dewlap on their throats.|$|E
5|$|This breed, {{along with}} other brachycephalic dogs (e.g., boxers, bulldogs), are also prone to hemivertebrae. The curled tail of a British bulldog {{is an example of}} a hemivertebrae, but when it occurs not in the {{coccygeal}} vertebrae but in other areas of the spine, it can cause paralysis. The condition occurs when two parts of <b>a</b> <b>spinal</b> vertebra do not fuse properly while a young Pug is still growing, resulting in an irregularly shaped spinal cavity which can put pressure on the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|Thunderball {{begins with}} a meeting between Bond and his superior, M, during which the agent is told that his latest {{physical}} assessment is poor because of excessive drinking and smoking (up to sixty cigarettes a day). M sends Bond on a two-week treatment at the Shrublands health clinic to improve his health. At the clinic Bond encounters Count Lippe, {{a member of the}} Red Lightning Tong criminal organisation from Macau. When Bond learns of the Tong connection, Lippe tries to kill him by tampering with <b>a</b> <b>spinal</b> traction machine. Bond, however, is saved by nurse Patricia Fearing and later retaliates against Lippe by trapping him in a steam bath, resulting in the Count's second-degree burns and a week's stay in hospital.|$|E

5|$|Without a role or rank, Kulikovsky brooded in Denmark, {{becoming}} moody and listless. <b>A</b> <b>spinal</b> injury sustained {{during the}} war, {{for which he}} had to wear a corset, remained unhealed. In 1925, Kulikovsky accompanied his wife to a Berlin nursing home to meet Anna Anderson, who claimed to be Olga's niece, Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia. According to Harriet von Rathlef, who witnessed the meeting, while Olga and Anderson conversed, he sat in a corner and sulked. Although Olga felt sympathy for Anderson, if only because she was ill, she eventually denounced her as an impostor. Possibly, she was pressured to do so by Kulikovsky and Dowager Empress Marie.|$|E
5|$|Back in Seattle, Dr. Ben Warren (Jason George) surprises his fiancée Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) with a visit. The couple reunites with {{constant}} sexual activity, {{for which the}} interns tease Bailey. Meanwhile, Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) allows Shepherd to operate on <b>a</b> <b>spinal</b> cord, despite his hand being broken from the plane crash. Thereafter, it is revealed that Sloan is in a comatose state, and will be taken off of life support that evening. In the hospital cafeteria, Meredith Grey announces that Wilson will be given the honor of performing a supervised appendectomy, a procedure historically used {{as a reward for}} interns. The hospital's chief of surgery, Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), introduces the new pediatric surgery attending, Dr. Mel Barnett (Philip Casnoff), to Torres and Karev. Barnett informs Karev that he will not be continuing with the African orphan charity program (a function to treat ill children from Third World countries), something that was initially finalized by the latter and former chief of pediatric surgery, Robbins. Karev becomes upset about this, and asks Torres to prevent Barnett from discontinuing the program, though Torres shows no interest in helping Karev.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, Copeland {{became a}} key figure in an alleged steroid ring and drug investigation. On March 19, Sports Illustrated posted an article on its website in its {{continuing}} series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used by a number of professional athletes in several sports. That article mentioned several current and former WWE wrestlers, including Copeland, who was alleged to have obtained HGH. Copeland has previously admitted to using steroids in April 2004 after neck surgery as an experiment on TSN's Off The Record with Michael Landsberg in January 2005. He said, he felt it slowed him down, so he quickly got off the substance. According to Copeland, he took HGH after returning from <b>a</b> <b>spinal</b> fusion neck surgery. He was told by doctors that it would help the bones grow back around the screws and plate that were inserted into his neck. He claims to have taken blood tests, consulted doctors, studied the drug, and got prescriptions before deciding to take them.|$|E
