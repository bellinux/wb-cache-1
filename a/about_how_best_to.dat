5|$|In 1998 the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group {{published}} a phylogeny for flowering plants {{based on an}} analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants. As {{a result of this}} work, many questions, such as which families represent the earliest branches of angiosperms, have now been answered. Investigating how plant species are related to each other allows botanists to better understand the process of evolution in plants. Despite the study of model plants and increasing use of DNA evidence, there is ongoing work and discussion among taxonomists <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> classify plants into various taxa. Technological developments such as computers and electron microscopes have greatly increased the level of detail studied and speed at which data can be analysed.|$|E
5|$|In late January {{and early}} February 1942, Galland first planned then {{commanded}} the Luftwaffe's air {{cover for the}} Kriegsmarine Operation Cerberus which was a major success. It earned him the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds. Over the ensuing years, Galland’s disagreements with Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> combat the Allied Air Forces bombing Germany caused their relationship to deteriorate. The Luftwaffe fighter force was under severe pressure by 1944, and Galland was blamed by Göring for the failure to prevent the Allied strategic bombing of Germany in daylight. The relationship collapsed altogether in early January 1945, when Galland was relieved of his command because of his constant criticism of the Luftwaffe leadership. Galland was then put under house arrest following the so-called Fighter Pilots' Revolt, in which senior fighter pilots confronted Göring about {{the conduct of the}} air war.|$|E
5|$|The first Space Shuttle {{flight to}} Mir was a {{rendezvous}} mission without docking on STS-63. This was followed {{during the course}} of the project by a total of 9 Shuttle-Mir docking missions, from STS-71 to STS-91. The Shuttle rotated crews and delivered supplies, and one mission, STS-74, carried a docking module and a pair of solar arrays to Mir. Various scientific experiments were also conducted, both on shuttle flights and long-term aboard the station. The project also saw the launch of two new modules, Spektr and Priroda, to Mir, which were used by American astronauts as living quarters and laboratories to conduct the majority of their science aboard the station. These missions allowed NASA and the Roskosmos to learn a great deal <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> work with international partners in space and how to minimize the risks associated with assembling a large space station in orbit, as would have to be done with the ISS.|$|E

5|$|Arriving {{as one of}} {{the first}} European {{settlers}} in the Americas, he initially participated in, but eventually felt compelled to oppose the atrocities committed against the Native Americans by the Spanish colonists. In 1515, he reformed his views, gave up his Indian slaves and encomienda, and advocated, before King Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, on behalf of rights for the natives. In his early writings, he advocated the use of African slaves instead of Natives in the West-Indian colonies; consequently, criticisms have been leveled at him as being partly responsible for the beginning of the Transatlantic slave trade. Later in life, he retracted those early views as he came to see all forms of slavery as equally wrong. In 1522, he attempted to launch a new kind of peaceful colonialism on the coast of Venezuela, but this venture failed, causing Las Casas to enter the Dominican Order and become a friar, leaving the public scene for a decade. He then traveled to Central America undertaking peaceful evangelization among the Maya of Guatemala and participated in debates among the Mexican churchmen <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> bring the natives to the Christian faith.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} era of HIV/AIDS, {{healthcare}} providers in the U.S. {{played a key}} role in confronting this serious and previously unknown condition. San Francisco General Hospital was an early epicenter for HIV treatment, and quickly became a leader in HIV/AIDS management. The AIDS crisis soon led to new interventions to support and encourage major advances in care delivery. One of the programs to arise out of the national response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic was the Clinician Consultation Center (CCC), originally called the National Clinicians’ Consultation Center. These clinicians began to think creatively <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>best</b> respond <b>to</b> the crisis in a way that would be broadly useful and supportive of all healthcare providers. The service, which was multi-disciplinary and multi-specialty, was a way for clinicians to get state-of-the-science advice. The goal was to improve care for patients across the country by sharing rapidly-developing information from a leading healthcare institution.|$|R

25|$|In October 1991, Chrétien first {{gave his}} views <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> end the {{recession}} which {{had begun in}} 1990. Chrétien argued that the answer was a policy of slow devaluation where the dollar {{would be allowed to}} decline against other major world currencies, which would have the effect of both pricing out foreign imports and by giving Canadian firms a competitive advantage in world markets, boost exports. However, Chrétien concluded that his planned export offensive powered by a low dollar would come to nothing if other nations maintained tariffs to keep Canadian goods out of their markets. In order to make his plans to export Canada back into prosperity work, Chrétien decided that the solution was globalization. Besides for globalization, Chrétien also argued to combat the recession, the federal government needed to make the system of unemployment insurance less generous, and to end the policy of high interest rates maintained by the Bank of Canada governor John Crow to achieve his target of 0% inflation, which Chrétien argued was needlessly crippling the economy.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{thanks to}} the {{importance}} of the French market to the Dutch, {{and the fact that the}} Dutch had less possibilities of imposing counter-pressure than they had in their conflicts with the English, the Dutch government at first tried to ignore the hostile policies of Colbert. Its inaction was also caused by differences of opinion <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> proceed within the States Party. Amsterdam, and especially the Amsterdam diplomat Coenraad van Beuningen, argued in favor of firm economic counter-measures against the French economic policies, paired with the forming of a defensive alliance with Spain and the Holy Roman Empire. De Witt, however, preferred avoiding such foreign entanglements, and a conciliatory approach in the economic sphere. As their economic interests were severely damaged by the French protectionism, the industrial cities of Leiden and Haarlem, however, teamed up with Amsterdam to support a more belligerent diplomacy. After the Rotterdam regents were promised compensation for the damage to their wine trade, to get their assent, the States of Holland decided in 1671 on severe retaliatory measures against French imports, in effect banning French wine, vinegar, paper, and sail-canvas. The stage was now set for war.|$|E
