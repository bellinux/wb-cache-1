5|$|Muhammad sent three leading Muslims {{to bring}} him details of the recent developments. He advised the men to openly declare their findings, should they find the Banu Qurayza to be loyal, so as to {{increase}} {{the morale of the}} Muslim fighters.

5|$|The larger workhouses had {{separate}} {{dining rooms}} {{for males and}} females; workhouses without separate dining rooms would stagger the meal times to <b>avoid</b> <b>any</b> contact between the sexes. Rations provided for the indoor staff were {{much the same as}} those for the paupers, although more generous. The master and matron, for instance, received six times the amount of food given to a pauper.|$|E
5|$|Tillingbourne {{introduced}} a new tourist route {{in the summer of}} 1995. Operating on Sundays for six months of the year, it provided a circular service linking Guildford, Godalming and Cranleigh with a number of nearby rural locations not served by other routes. Although similar services were operated by London & Country and Nostalgiabus, the new service was designed to <b>avoid</b> <b>any</b> direct competition. The route was operated with a Bristol SU single-decker acquired from a bus preservationist.|$|E

Amid an NFL investigation, he went public to <b>avoid</b> <b>any</b> rumors about his condition. In May 1996, he went into treatment and remained in rehabilitation for 46 days. Had he chosen not to go, the NFL would have imposed a $900,000 fine.|$|E

Flying over the lakes is also discouraged except for scientific reasons. Vehicular traffic is {{banned in the}} reserved areas. Taking samples from the lake is to be kept to the minimum even for scientific studies and also the equipment brought from outside for sampling, {{and it must be}} thoroughly washed to <b>avoid</b> <b>any</b> type of contamination from outside. There are many more rules and regulations that are set by the authorities, which have to be strictly adhered to.|$|E
5|$|After {{consecutive}} retirements in {{the previous}} three races which included first lap collisions in Austria and Germany, Michael Schumacher said that his objective in Hungary was to <b>avoid</b> <b>any</b> incidents on the first lap and to finish in a points-scoring position. He was also confident that Ferrari would perform well at the circuit. Barrichello revealed that he received backing from Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo to challenge for more victories and the championship despite the latter's comments to the press about Barrichello assisting Michael Schumacher's title aspirations.|$|E

5|$|Ambassador Bishop clearly {{explained}} his rationale {{to the security}} detail, which was to <b>avoid</b> <b>any</b> impression that they were intervening in the violence in Mogadishu. He feared that the embassy would be targeted by organized attacks if any group involved in the clashes {{got the impression that}} the US was intervening in the conflict. To this effect, he requested the Voice of America and BBC broadcast announcements that the forces were present only to evacuate the embassy and would not interfere in the conflict. The Marines who had been doused in fuel during the refueling were able to take a shower and wash their clothes.|$|E
5|$|Currently, the {{government}} of Iran has taken steps to <b>avoid</b> <b>any</b> competition between its athletes and those from Israel. An Iranian judoka, Arash Miresmaeili, did not compete in a match against an Israeli during the 2004 Summer Olympics. Although he was officially disqualified for being overweight, Miresmaeli was awarded US$125,000 in prize money by the Iranian government, an amount paid to all Iranian gold medal winners. He was officially cleared of intentionally avoiding the bout, but his receipt of the prize money raised suspicion.|$|E
5|$|Driberg made {{no secret}} of his homosexuality, which he practised {{throughout}} his life despite its being a criminal offence in Britain until 1967; his ability to <b>avoid</b> <b>any</b> consequences for his risky and often brazen behaviour baffled his friends and colleagues. Always in search of bizarre experiences, Driberg befriended at various times the occultist Aleister Crowley and the Kray twins, along with honoured and respected figures in the worlds of literature and politics. He combined this lifestyle with an unwavering devotion to Anglo-Catholicism. After his death, allegations were published about his role over many years as an MI5 informant, a KGB agent, or both. The extent and nature of Driberg's involvement with these agencies remain uncertain.|$|E

5|$|During the Spanish Civil War, several {{countries}} followed {{a principle of}} non-intervention, to <b>avoid</b> <b>any</b> potential escalation and possible expansion of the war to other nations, which {{would result in the}} signing of the Non-Intervention Agreement in August 1936 and the setting up of the Non-Intervention Committee, which first met in September. Primarily arranged by the French and British governments, important members of the committee also included the Soviet Union, Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Ultimately, the committee had the support of 27 nations.|$|E
5|$|Fleming's second non-fiction {{book was}} {{published}} in November 1963: Thrilling Cities, a reprint {{of a series of}} Sunday Times articles based on Fleming's impressions of a number of world cities in trips taken during 1959 and 1960. Approached in 1964 by producer Norman Felton to write a spy series for television, Fleming provided several ideas, including the names of characters Napoleon Solo and April Dancer, for the series The Man from U.N.C.L.E. However, Fleming withdrew from the project following a request from Eon Productions, who were keen to <b>avoid</b> <b>any</b> legal problems that might occur if the project overlapped with the Bond films.|$|E
5|$|In early 1971, Rainbow played {{its first}} show, which {{consisted}} of two sets performed at Richmond Community College in Staten Island. After the show, the group discovered that there was already another band called Rainbow. They decided to drop the name, {{and came up with}} the name Wicked Lester, which Klein liked because it was unusual. While the decision to change the group's name came partly out of a desire to <b>avoid</b> <b>any</b> potential legal issues, it also reflected Klein and Eisen's desire to start playing more original compositions.|$|E

5|$|It took {{thirty minutes}} {{to clear the}} runway and rig an arresting cable and Armstrong telephoned Edwards and asked for someone to collect him. Milt Thompson was sent in an F-104B, the only {{two-seater}} available, but a plane Thompson had never flown. With great difficulty, Thompson made it to Nellis, but a strong crosswind caused a hard landing and the left main tire suffered a blowout. The runway was again closed to clear it, and Bill Dana was sent to Nellis in a T-33 Shooting Star, but he almost landed long—and the Nellis base operations office decided that to <b>avoid</b> <b>any</b> further problems, {{it would be best}} to find the three NASA pilots ground transport back to Edwards.|$|E
5|$|O'Brien {{immediately}} {{sued the}} British Government for false imprisonment, and to <b>avoid</b> <b>any</b> liability the government prepared the Restoration of Order in Ireland (Indemnity) Act 1923 which would indemnify them against any claims for damages by the imprisoned sympathisers. The Labour Party whittled it down {{when it was}} being prepared {{so that it would}} only limit compensation rather than remove it entirely. A tribunal was set up under Lord Atkin to assess damages, and the sympathisers as a whole were eventually paid £43,000. Art O'Brien himself was arrested soon after release and convicted of sedition. He was released in 1924.|$|E

Phil, however, is furious {{that he did not}} get the opportunity to do it himself. Tony and Johnny meet at Johnny's house in a reconciliatory manner, but Johnny is arrested by Federal agents, while Tony escapes.|$|E
