25|$|The World Health Organizations {{recommended}} <b>albendazole</b> or mebendazole for treatment.|$|E
25|$|Mammomonogamiasis is {{relatively}} easy to treat. Manual or bronchoscopic removal of worms has been successful. One case followed up with aspiration. Although no controlled study on the efficacy of antihelmintics in treating mammomonogamiasis has been conducted, most patients were given <b>albendazole,</b> mebendazole or thiabendazole with no adverse effects. Patients given <b>albendazole</b> were instructed to take 400mg for three days or if given a combination of drugs, <b>albendazole</b> is given 200mg, three times a day for three days, with mebendazole at 100mg, three times a day for three days. The drug regimens ranged from 200–3000mg/day for three to 20 days.|$|E
25|$|<b>Albendazole</b> is {{effective}} {{both in the}} intestinal stage and during the stage the parasite is still migrating under the skin.|$|E
25|$|GSK's {{commitment}} to give free <b>albendazole</b> tablets to the WHO for, and until, {{the elimination of}} lymphatic filariasis worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Medications {{that are}} used to kill roundworms are called ascaricides. Those {{recommended}} by the World Health Organization for ascariasis are: <b>albendazole,</b> mebendazole, levamisole and pyrantel pamoate. Other effective agents include tribendimidine and nitazoxanide. Pyrantel pamoate may induce intestinal obstruction in a heavy worm load. <b>Albendazole</b> is contraindicated during pregnancy and children under two years of age. Thiabendazole may cause migration of the worm into the esophagus, so it is usually combined with piperazine.|$|E
25|$|For this purpose, broad-spectrum benzimidazoles such as {{mebendazole}} and <b>albendazole</b> are {{the drugs}} of choice recommended by WHO. These anthelminthics are administered {{in a single}} dose are safe, relatively inexpensive, and effective for several months. Mebendazole can be given with a single dose twice a day for three consecutive days. <b>Albendazole</b> is given at a single dose. WHO recommends annual treatment in areas where between 20 and 50% of people are infected, and a twice a year treatment if it is over 50%; and in low risk situation (i.e. less than 20% prevalence) case-by-case treatment. In addition to these, pyrantel pamoate is also equally effective on ascaris. However, {{it has been reported}} that <b>albendazole,</b> mebendazole, and pyrantel pamoate are not entirely effective against T. trichiura with single oral doses in population-based control.|$|E
25|$|Whilst {{the use of}} {{thiabendazole}} has waned, newer generation benzimidazole compounds such as <b>albendazole</b> and fenbendazole are to {{this day}} used widely in people and domestic animals.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{treatment}} for hookworm are benzimidazoles, specifically <b>albendazole</b> and mebendazole. BZAs kill adult worms by binding to the nematode’s β-tubulin and subsequently inhibiting microtubule polymerization within the parasite. In certain circumstances, levamisole and pyrantel pamoate may be used. A 2008 review {{found that the}} efficacy of single-dose treatments for hookworm infections were as follows: 72% for <b>albendazole,</b> 15% for mebendazole, and 31% for pyrantel pamoate. This substantiates prior claims that <b>albendazole</b> is much more effective than mebendazole for hookworm infections. Also of note is that the World Health Organization does recommend anthelmintic treatment in pregnant women after the first trimester. It is also recommended that if the patient also suffers from anemia that ferrous sulfate (200mg) be administered three times daily {{at the same time}} as anthelmintic treatment; this should be continued until hemoglobin values return to normal which could take up to 3 months.|$|E
25|$|Cysticercosis {{caused by}} {{infection}} of the brain and/or muscles with the eggs and larvae of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium (though it has been judged less effective than <b>albendazole</b> in treatment of neurocysticercosis).|$|E
25|$|If {{complications}} of helminthiasis, such as intestinal obstruction occur, emergency surgery may be required. Patients who require non-emergency surgery, for instance for removal of worms from the biliary tree, can be pre-treated with the anthelmintic drug <b>albendazole.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because {{infection}} is rarely symptomatic, treatment is rarely required. There {{have been no}} published trials so treatment remains empirical. Agents {{that have been used}} include <b>albendazole,</b> metronidazole and cotrimoxazole for myositis. Corticosteroids have also been used for symptomatic relief.|$|E
25|$|Prevention is by {{not walking}} barefoot where {{the disease is}} common. At a {{population}} level, decreasing outdoor defecation, not using feces as fertilizer, and mass deworming is effective. Treatment is typically with the medications <b>albendazole</b> or mebendazole for one to three days. Iron supplements may be needed in those with anemia.|$|E
25|$|In {{areas where}} more than 20% of the {{population}} is affected treating everyone is recommended. This has a cost of about 2 to 3 cents per person per treatment. This is known as mass drug administration and is often carried out among school-age children. For this purpose, broad-spectrum benzimidazoles such as mebendazole and <b>albendazole</b> are the drugs of choice recommended by WHO.|$|E
25|$|Prevention is by {{improved}} sanitation, {{which includes}} improving access to toilets and proper disposal of feces. Handwashing with soap appears protective. In areas {{where more than}} 20% {{of the population is}} affected, treating everyone at regular intervals is recommended. Reoccurring infections are common. There is no vaccine. Treatments recommended by the World Health Organization are the medications <b>albendazole,</b> mebendazole, levamisole, or pyrantel pamoate. Other effective agents include tribendimidine and nitazoxanide.|$|E
25|$|Broad-spectrum benzimidazoles (such as <b>albendazole</b> and mebendazole) are {{the first}} line {{treatment}} of intestinal roundworm and tapeworm infections. Macrocyclic lactones (such as ivermectin) are effective against adult and migrating larval stages of nematodes. Praziquantel is the drug of choice for schistosomiasis, taeniasis, and most types of food-borne trematodiases. Oxamniquine is also widely used in mass deworming programmes. Pyrantel is commonly used for veterinary nematodiasis. Artemisinins and derivatives are proving to be candidates as drugs of choice for trematodiasis.|$|E
25|$|A 1999 {{in vitro}} study from Pakistan found 40% of {{isolates}} {{are resistant to}} common antiprotozoal drugs. A study of isolates from patients diagnosed with IBS found 40% of isolates resistant to metronidazole and 32% resistant to furazolidone. Drugs reported in studies {{to be effective in}} eradicating Blastocystis infection have included metronidazole, trimethoprim, TMP-SMX (only trimethoprim is active with sulphamethoxazole demonstrating no activity), tetracycline, doxycycline, nitazoxanide, pentamidine, paromomycin and iodoquinol. Iodoquinol {{has been found to be}} less effective in practice than in-vitro. Miconazole and quinacrine have been reported as effective agents against Blastocystis growth in-vitro. Rifaximin, and <b>albendazole</b> have shown promise as has ivermectin which demonstrated high effectiveness against blastocystis hominis isolates in an in vitro study. There is also evidence that the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii, and the plant mallotus oppositifolius may be effective against Blastocystis infections.|$|E
2500|$|Benzimidazoles: {{triclabendazole}} (Fasinex), <b>albendazole</b> (Vermitan, Valbazen), mebendazol (Telmin), luxabendazole (Fluxacur) ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{control of}} fascioloidosis in wild ruminants, {{successful}} application of anthelminthics in feed is necessary. The drug {{has to have}} flavour and smell that do not prevent animals from eating medicated feed. In addition, there should adequate therapeutic scope, i.e. span between therapeutic and minimal toxic dose. Therefore, only some of anthelminthics that are efficient in domestic ruminants have been tested in wild ruminants infected with F. magna. Several drugs, namely oxyclozanide, rafoxanide, <b>albendazole,</b> diamphenetide, closantel, clorsulon, and triclabendazole, {{have been used in}} control of F. magna infection in cervids. However, the results have differed between different authors. In the same way as for F. hepatica, triclabendazole seems to be the most effective against F. magna. Fascioloidosis of cervids was successfully controlled with triclabendazole in USA, and [...] triclabendazole with levamizole in Hungary, Canada, Austria, and Croatia. In contrast, rafoxanide is commonly used in treatment in Czech Republic [...] Slovakia [...] and Hungary. Nevertheless, recent studies suggested that use of rafoxanide in control of F. magna infection should be considered. Unfortunately, rafoxanide in a commercial drug called Rafendazol Premix is the only registered drug for wild ruminants. Triclabendazole and others are produced as drugs for domestic animals and it can be used in free-living animals only with special permit. In some cases, {{it may be difficult to}} determine if F. magna or a different fluke such as Fasciola hepatica or Fasciola gigantica is causing pathology since all these flukes will have the same clinical signs. In the case that the identity of the trematode cannot be determined, the drug triclabendazole can be used since this will deal with all three parasites.|$|E
50|$|The antacid {{cimetidine}} heightens serum <b>albendazole</b> concentrations, {{increases the}} half life of <b>albendazole,</b> and doubles <b>albendazole</b> sulfoxide levels in bile. It was originally thought {{to work by}} increasing <b>albendazole</b> bioavailability directly; however, it is now known that cimetidine inhibits the breakdown of <b>albendazole</b> sulfoxide by interfering with CYP3A4. The half-life of <b>albendazole</b> sulfoxide thus increases from 7.4 hours to 19 hours. This might be a helpful interaction on more severe cases, because it boosts the potency of <b>albendazole.</b> Paradoxically, cimetidine also inhibits the absorption of <b>albendazole</b> by reducing gastric acidity.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>albendazole</b> + NADPH + H+ + O2 [...] <b>albendazole</b> S-oxide + NADP+ + H2O ...|$|E
50|$|Several other {{interactions}} exist. Corticosteroids {{increase the}} steady-state plasma concentration of <b>albendazole</b> sulfoxide; dexamethasone, for example, {{can increase the}} concentration by 56% by inhibiting the elimination of <b>albendazole</b> sulfoxide. The anti-parasitic praziquantel increases the maximum plasma concentration of <b>albendazole</b> sulfoxide by 50%, and the anti-parasitic levamisole increases the AUC (total drug exposure) by 75%. Grapefruit inhibits the metabolism of <b>albendazole</b> within the intestinal mucosa. Finally, long-term administration of the antiretroviral ritonavir, which works as a CYP3A4 inhibitor, decreases the maximum concentration of <b>albendazole</b> in the plasma {{as well as the}} AUC.|$|E
50|$|The four {{substrates}} of this enzyme are <b>albendazole,</b> NADPH, H+, and O2, whereas {{its three}} products are <b>albendazole</b> S-oxide, NADP+, and H2O.|$|E
50|$|Some parasites {{have evolved}} to have some {{resistance}} to <b>albendazole</b> by having {{a different set of}} acids comprising β-tubulin, decreasing the binding affinity of <b>albendazole.</b>|$|E
5000|$|For {{systemic}} parasites, <b>albendazole</b> {{acts as a}} prodrug, while <b>albendazole</b> sulfoxide reaches systemic {{circulation and}} acts as the real antihelminthic. <b>Albendazole</b> sulfoxide is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the cerebrospinal fuid at 43% of plasma concentrations; its ability to enter {{the central nervous system}} is what allows it to treat neurocystocercosis.|$|E
50|$|Surgical removal or {{treatment}} with <b>albendazole</b> or ivermectin is recommended. The most prescribed treatment for gnathostomiasis is surgical {{removal of the}} larvae but this is only effective when the worms are located in an accessible location. In addition to surgical excision, <b>albendazole</b> and ivermectin have been noted {{in their ability to}} eliminate the parasite. <b>Albendazole</b> is recommended to be administered at 400 mg daily for 21 days as an adjunct to surgical excision, while ivermectin is better tolerated as a single dose. Ivermectin can also serve as a replacement for those that can’t handle <b>albendazole</b> 200 ug/kg p.o. as a single dose. However, ivermectin {{has been shown to be}} less effective then <b>albendazole.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{pregnant}} dogs, <b>albendazole</b> use has lead to puppies {{with reduced}} weight and with cleft palates. Birds have {{lower rates of}} laying eggs and hatching when given <b>albendazole.</b>|$|E
50|$|Successful {{treatment}} of human cases with thiabendazole or <b>albendazole</b> (with or without corticosteroids) have been reported. <b>Albendazole</b> {{must be taken}} with food because a fatty meal will increase the Bioavailability of the drug.|$|E
5000|$|An {{infection}} of N. americanus parasites {{can be treated}} by using benzimidazoles, <b>albendazole,</b> and mebendazole. A blood transfusion may be necessary in severe cases of anemia. Light infections are usually left untreated in areas where reinfection is common. Iron supplements and a diet high in protein will speed the recovery process. [...] In a case study involving 56-60 men with Trichuris trichiura and/or N. americanus infections, both <b>albendazole</b> and mebendazole were 90% effective in curing T. trichiura. However, <b>albendazole</b> had a 95% cure rate for N. americanus, while mebendazole only had a 21% cure rate. This suggests <b>albendazole</b> is most effective for treating both T. trichiura and N. americanus.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Albendazole</b> {{sulfoxide}} {{is converted}} to the inactive <b>albendazole</b> sulfone by cytochrome P450 oxidases, thought to include CYP3A4 and/or CYP2C. Other inactive metabolites include: 2-aminosulfone, ω-hydroxysulfone, and β-hydroxysulfone. The major final metabolites that are excreted by humans are: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Albendazole</b> {{undergoes}} {{very fast}} 1st-pass metabolism in all species, {{such that the}} unchanged drug is undetectable in plasma. Most of it is oxidized into <b>albendazole</b> sulfoxide (also known as ricobendazole and <b>albendazole</b> oxide) in the liver by cytochrome P450 oxidases (CYPs) and a flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO), which was discovered later. In humans, the cytochrome P450 oxidases are thought to include CYP3A4 and CYP1A1, while those in the rats {{are thought to be}} CYP2C6 and CYP2A1.|$|E
50|$|Different {{trials were}} made to use the known drug at its maximum {{capacity}} in absence of new drugs. In a study from India, it was shown that a formulation of <b>albendazole</b> had better anti-filarial efficacy than <b>albendazole</b> itself.|$|E
50|$|<b>Albendazole</b> is a {{pregnancy}} class D drug in Australia and pregnancy class C in the United States. It is contraindicated {{in the first}} trimester of pregnancy, {{and should not be}} avoided up to one month before conception. While studies in pregnant rats and rabbits have shown <b>albendazole</b> to be teratogenic, <b>albendazole</b> {{has been found to be}} safe in humans during the second and third trimesters. It can, however, possibly cause infantile eczema when given during pregnancy.|$|E
50|$|Another agent used is <b>albendazole.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The typical adult {{therapy for}} oesophagostomiasis {{is a single}} 400 mg dose of <b>albendazole</b> (200 mg for children) or {{pyrantel}} pamoate. [...] <b>Albendazole</b> works by binding to the free beta tubulin, which inhibits tubulin polymerization. This results in the inhibition of glucose uptake by the Oesophagostomum. <b>Albendazole</b> and pyrantel pamoate at these doses have cure rates of 85% and 59-82%, respectively. Excision of Oesophagostomum larvae from nodules {{has been shown to}} have a curative effect on the patient but is invasive and more resource intensive than chemotherapy. For oesophagostomiasis with complications, the type of treatment varies depending on the severity of the disease. Usually 200-400 mg of <b>albendazole</b> will be given immediately and continued for up to 5 days in conjunction with 250 mg dosages of amoxicillin.In the case of formation of abscesses or fistulae arising from Dapaong tumors, incision and drainage is performed, followed by a regimen of <b>albendazole</b> and antibiotic treatment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Albendazole</b> is {{a common}} drug treatment.|$|E
50|$|GlaxoSmithKline: A London-based {{multinational}} pharmaceutical {{and consumer}} healthcare company headquartered will donate 400 million <b>albendazole</b> tablets {{each year to}} fight soil-transmitted helminthiasis. Further {{it will continue to}} provide 600 million tablets <b>albendazole</b> per year for lymphatic filariasis as long as necessary until the disease is eliminated.|$|E
