40|$|ABSTRACT: Aeration is {{currently}} {{the most commonly used}} technique to improve the drying and storage of grain, depending on temperature and water content of the grain, as of the temperature and relative humidity of the outside air. In order to monitor temperature and humidity of the grain mass, it is possible to have a network of sensors in the cells of both internal and external storage. Use of artificial intelligence through Fuzzy theory, has been used since the 60 s and enables their application on various forms. Thus, it is observed that the <b>aeration</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> in function of representing a system of controlled environment can be studied in relation to the application of this theory. Therefore, the aim {{of this paper is to}} present an embedded Fuzzy control system based on the mathematical model of CRUZ et al. (2002) and applied to the Arduino platform, for decision support in <b>aeration</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain.</b> For this, an embedded Arduino system was developed, which received the environmental values of temperature and humidity to then be processed in a Fuzzy controller and return the output as a recommendation to control the aeration process rationally. Comparing the results obtained from the graph presented by LASSERAN (1981) it was observed that the system is effective...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate and compare the performance of three different strategies for <b>aeration</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> corn. The strategies investigated were: continuous aeration, night aeration, and aeration in equilibrium moisture content between the grain and the ambient air. Corn at two different moisture content levels, 11 % and 17 % were used. Continuous monitoring of grain temperature through sensors was carried out, and grain samples were taken during the experiments for determination of moisture content. All used aeration strategies favored temperature reduction in dry (11 %) and moist (17 %) grains. The continuous aeration strategy was the most efficient in wet grains, since heating of grains during storage was avoided. No aeration strategy maintained the homogeneous temperature inside the grain during the storage; it varied according to climatic conditions. The moisture content of grains has suffered variations during the experimental period, with a tendency of drying {{at the end of the}} process...|$|E
40|$|The <b>aeration</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> silos {{provides}} a convenient means of controlling temperature and moisture distribution in a silo. The moisture migration process is {{initiated by the}} presence of temperature gradients which causes natural convective air movement within the grain. By being able to predict the moisture and temperature behaviour during the grain aeration process, the grower will be able to produce a more efficient aeration process that minimises grain spoilage. The purpose of this project is to investigate the aeration characteristics of a grain silo using a Computational Fluid Dynamics package and develop an understanding of the complexities involved with the modelling of grain ecosystems with regard to air movement, moisture migration and temperature distribution within the grain. More specifically, this project seeks to investigate numerically the effect of different parameters of silos (size, shape, material, type or design and aeration rate) on the temperature distribution in the stored grain, under a variety of seasonal conditions. The computational fluid dynamics software (Fluent 6. 0) was used to investigate these parameters and provided results in the form of contour plots (temperature and pressure) and velocity vector plots. The CFD package {{provides a}} strong basis for the analysis of packed beds. However, further attention needs to be paid to the reactions within the intergranular environment to allow the program to produce results of a higher degree of accuracy...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} work suggested a method <b>of</b> reducing <b>grain</b> bulk temperature and avoiding moisture transfer in a storage bin during <b>aeration</b> <b>of</b> stored <b>grain</b> {{by using a}} desiccant tray unit.

The simulation program was developed based on the AERO program and the model of desiccant tray which assist users in the prediction <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> temperature and moisture content. According to the ambient air condition, the number of trays would be suitably calculated for storage conditions in humid tropical regions.

40|$|This {{publication}} {{describes how}} to use fan performance and system resistance data to achieve the desired effect and efficiency of a ventilation system. Many people perceive ventilation simply as a fan. However, effective ventilation of a livestock building or the <b>aeration</b> <b>of</b> stored <b>grain</b> requires a complete ventilation system. A simple ventilation system may consist of fans to move the air, inlets or outlets for air distribution, and manual controls. More complex systems may include ducts, perforated floors, automatic controls, and other components. Regardless, all components must be carefully designed, selected, installed, managed, and maintained to achieve satisfactory results. A fan is a mechanical device that uses energy inputs to move air, and {{can be thought of}} as the 2 ̆ 2 heart 2 ̆ 2 of a mechanical ventilation system. A basic understanding of fan performance is important when selecting and managing a mechanical ventilation system, regardless of the application...|$|R
40|$|Chilling <b>aeration</b> <b>of</b> stored <b>grain</b> is {{becoming}} very popular {{around the world}} since it offers many advantages in situations where ambient air conditions are not adequate to cool grain. It allows to cool <b>grain,</b> independent <b>of</b> ambient conditions, to “safe” temperatures where insect, fungi, and spoilage development is reduced to the minimum, {{and at the same}} time can potentially reduce chemical control use. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness <b>of</b> chilling <b>aeration</b> to preserve grain quality and control insect-pests. The research trial was developed from August to November 2015 in Central Kansas in two 1, 270 metric tons (MT) steel bins with low-moisture wheat from the 2015 summer harvest. One bin was chilled and the other was used as a control (ambient aeration). Variables evaluated were: moisture content (MC), grain and flour quality, insect-pest development and reproduction rate, insect fragments per kg, and fungi presence. Chilling aeration cooled the grain in 135 hours to an average of 17 ⁰C, with minimum variation through the four months. Ambient aeration in the control bin cooled the grain to an average of 22 ⁰C after 308 hours, with variation over 16 ⁰C through the four months. Lower temperatures significantly diminished insect development and reproduction rate. Flour quality was better preserved in the chilled than in the control bin. There was no significant effect on MC, grain quality or fungi presence. The energy cost <b>of</b> running the <b>grain</b> chiller was 0. 22 $/MT more than the cost <b>of</b> ambient <b>aeration</b> in the control bin...|$|R
40|$|This {{bulletin}} summarizes nearly 10 {{years of}} research related to wheat stored on farms and in elevators in Kansas. It describes on-farm equipment and pest control practices and typical storage conditions that affect grain quality. The cost-effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>aeration,</b> <b>grain</b> protectants, and fumigation was evaluated. Grain cooling by aeration was the most effective insect-control technique and had the lowest variable cost but often was managed poorly. Automatically controlled fans increased the efficiency and convenience <b>of</b> <b>aeration</b> for insect control. Malathion protectants performed poorly. Applying Reldan ® (chlorpyriphos-methyl) protectant was more costly than other techniques but was generally effective. Treatment of farm-stored wheat with phosphine fumigants was shown to be often unsuccessful, and methods of making fumigation more effective in farm bins were tested. The relationships between producer, buyer, wheat quality (especially factors affected during storage), and price were investigated, and wheat marketing practices are summarized. Discounting practices at Kansas elevators appeared to provide a weak and mixed message relative {{to the importance of}} insect control in farm storage.

Barkan, was investigated. And the results were as follows. 1. The isolated iron combined with CN and missed the measurement, but the error of measurement could be prevented by the heating process on the fire after the addition of concentrated sulphuric acid and perchloric acid. On the other hand, the measuring error caused by the contain of iron in reagent could be prevented by the use of ammonia instead of caustic soda. 2. It was necessary to stand in the room temperature for 24 hours after the o-phenanthrolin reaction for the measurement of iron by o-phenanthrolin in the reaction solution using phosphate buffer. 3. When the iron dosis in various buffer was measured, the <b>aeration</b> <b>of</b> CO gas had no influence on the measurement. 4. Measuring the dosis of easy split iron by the <b>aeration</b> <b>of</b> CO gas to hemoglobin for 30 minutes, it decreased about one half as compared with that before the <b>aeration</b> <b>of</b> CO gas and it showed only the reversion of 67 % by the <b>aeration</b> <b>of</b> oxygen for 60 minutes.

40|$|ABSTRACT.

A value <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> dry matter-to-air ratio {{equal to or greater}} than 0. 27 based on 1 -h time step was determined to yield close agreement between experimental and simulated moisture content profiles. Under such conditions, the simulated moisture content profiles were insensitive to the changes either in layer thickness or time step for a fixed value <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> dry matter-to-air ratio based on 1 -h time step.
