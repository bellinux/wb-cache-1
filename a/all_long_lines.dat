50|$|When {{magnetic}} fields move {{about in the}} vicinity of a conductor such as a wire, a geomagnetically induced current is produced in the conductor.

Notably, this chiefly includes operators in China, North America, and Australia, especially in modern high-voltage, low-resistance lines. The European grid consists mainly of shorter transmission circuits, which are less vulnerable to damage.|$|R

His beard, streaked thickly with gray, bristled forward from his chin, and spoke of a passionate nature, while the long, finely cut face and firm mouth marked the leader of men. His figure was erect and soldierly, and he rode his horse with the careless grace of a man whose life had been spent in the saddle. In common garb, his masterful face and flashing eye would have marked him as one who was born to rule; but now, with his silken tunic powdered with golden fleurs-de-lis, his velvet mantle lined with the royal minever, and the lions of England stamped in silver upon his harness, none could fail to recognize the noble Edward, most warlike and powerful of <b>all</b> the <b>long</b> <b>line</b> of fighting monarchs who had ruled the Anglo-Norman race.

This paper describes status of wahoo resource caught by tuna <b>long</b> <b>line</b> in Indian Ocean based at Benoa-Bali. Data obtained from onboard observer program on the tuna long liner based at Benoa-Bali during 2005 - 2010. Total of 85 trips of onboard observation were carried out with the total <b>long</b> <b>line</b> sets (one set per day) were 2873 times. The data covered the horizontal and vertical position of tuna <b>long</b> <b>line</b> hooks caught the wahoo, hook rate and fish size distribution. Data of horizontal fishing positions (coordinates) gained from the global positioning system availabled in the tuna long liners. The depth of the <b>long</b> <b>line</b> gear in the waters and teperature of waters were measured by mini-loggers TDR type SP 2 T- 1200, brand: NKE Micrel. Hook rate of wahoo is calculated using the Klawe (1986) method.
