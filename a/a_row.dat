5|$|Among Auerbach's accomplishments {{during his}} 20-year {{professional}} coaching career were eleven Eastern Division titles (including nine in <b>a</b> <b>row</b> from 1957–65), 11 {{appearances in the}} finals (including ten in <b>a</b> <b>row</b> from 1957–66), and nine NBA championships. With a total of 16 NBA championship rings in a span of 29 years (1957–86) as the Celtics coach, general manager, and team president, Auerbach is the most successful team official in NBA history. He is credited with creating several generations of championship Boston Celtics teams, including the first Celtics dynasty with Bill Russell, which won an NBA record eight titles in <b>a</b> <b>row</b> (1959–66). As Celtics general manager, he created championship-winning teams around Hall-of-Famers Dave Cowens in the 1970s and Larry Bird in the 1980s.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>rowing</b> {{cycle is}} <b>a</b> wheeled vehicle {{propelled}} by <b>a</b> <b>rowing</b> {{motion of the}} body. Steering, braking, and shifting are usually done by the handlebars. Feet are on symmetrical foot rests, as opposed to rotating pedals. Unlike many rowing boats, the rider faces forward. Rowing cycles exist in numerous designs, {{particularly with respect to}} frames and drive mechanisms. Commercial production numbers for rowing cycles are small compared to that of standard bicycles. Rowing cycles have the potential to be faster than traditional bicycles due to the higher output of torque generated by <b>a</b> <b>rowing</b> motion.|$|R

He won the pitcher of the month award again in July, the third Dodger (along with Don Sutton and Burt Hooton) to win it two months in <b>a</b> <b>row.</b> He was 4–0 with a 1.10 ERA in the month with 48 strikeouts and only 10 walks. He picked up his 200th strikeout of the season on September 2, the fifth year in <b>a</b> <b>row</b> he had reached that number, trailing only the six seasons in <b>a</b> <b>row</b> for Sandy Koufax among Dodger starters. He also became just the fourth pitcher since 1893 to have at least five 200-strikeout seasons through an age-26 season (Bert Blyleven, Walter Johnson and Sam McDowell are the others).|$|E

5|$|The 21st century {{began with}} two more cup titles for Maccabi Tel Aviv, before two seasons in <b>a</b> <b>row</b> saw {{respective}} firsts for the Israel State Cup.

Three more second-tier clubs, Hapoel Haifa, Maccabi Herzliya and Hapoel Ashkelon, reached the final in 2004, 2005 and 2007 respectively, but none of these won the deciding match. Following Bnei Sakhnin's victory teams from Jerusalem and Tel Aviv reclaimed dominance—Maccabi Tel Aviv lifted the cup in 2005, Beitar Jerusalem won two titles in <b>a</b> <b>row</b> in 2008 and 2009 and Hapoel Tel Aviv twice in <b>a</b> <b>row</b> in 2006 and 2007, and then three times consecutively from 2010 to 2012.
