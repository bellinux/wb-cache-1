5|$|Another {{conjecture}} is {{that the}} breed is descended from the 89horses brought to the islands in 1526 by Spanish explorer Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón. His attempted colonization of San Miguel de Gualdape (near the Santee River in South Carolina) failed, forcing the colonists to move, possibly to North Carolina. Vázquez de Ayllón and about 450 of the original 600colonists subsequently {{died as a result}} of desertion, disease, <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> frost. Lacking effective leadership, the new settlement lasted for only two months; the survivors abandoned the colony and fled to Hispaniola, leaving their horses behind.|$|E

5|$|Douglas Carl Engelbart (January 30, 1925– July 2, 2013) was an American {{engineer}} and inventor, <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> computer and Internet pioneer. He {{is best known}} for his work on founding the field of human–computer interaction, particularly while at his Augmentation Research Center Lab in SRI International, which resulted in creation of the computer mouse, and the development of hypertext, networked computers, and precursors to graphical user interfaces. These were demonstrated at The Mother of All Demos in 1968. Engelbart's Law, the observation that the intrinsic rate of human performance is exponential, is named after him.|$|E
5|$|From 1890 to 1905 {{the area}} was home to the Amphitheatre Auditorium, which claimed the second largest stage in the United States and showcased many of the day's best actors. The structure, located {{at the corner of}} 4th and Hill Streets, was razed after its owner, William Norton, Jr., died. Another form of {{entertainment}} in {{the area was}} baseball, with the game first being played by 1860 <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> ballpark at Fourth and Ormsby emerging after the Civil War. By 1875, a new park had been built near St. James Court.|$|E

5|$|Psittacosaurus {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} ceratopsians, but closer to Triceratops than Yinlong. Once in its own family, Psittacosauridae, with other genera like Hongshanosaurus, it is now considered to be senior synonym of the latter <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> offshoot of the branch that led to more derived forms. The genera closely related to Psittacosaurus are all from Asia, with the exception of Aquilops, from North America. The first species was either P. lujiatunensis or closely related, and it may have given rise to later forms of Psittacosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Collyer Monument is an {{historic}} monument to firefighters in Mineral Spring Park, {{at the corner}} of Mineral Spring Avenue and Main Street, in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, United States. The monument was built in 1890 by the sculptor Charles Parker Dowler to honor Samuel Smith Collyer, a fallen Pawtucket Fire Chief. The life-size bronze sculpture stands atop a pedestal of Westerly granite which contains a bronze plaque showing the fatal accident and the reverse bears the inscription. The Collyer Monument represents a significant example of monumental work of the period <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> example of local civic pride. The monument was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E

5|$|Gisborough Priory was rebuilt three times; {{the ruins}} visible today are principally {{those of the}} third rebuild. The site was {{occupied}} in Anglo-Saxon times {{by at least one}} structure, possibly a timber-framed church or boundary wall, indicated by a number of postholes. It is believed there was a Saxon settlement in the vicinity as late-Saxon potsherds and an 8th-century coin have been found buried under the remains of the priory's west nave. The site was abandoned at some point {{and by the time the}} priory was built the land on which it stood was mostly under cultivation. Part of it was used as a graveyard in the early 12th century <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> Norman building was erected in the vicinity, possibly a temporary church.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Defender {{established}} scrolling in shoot 'em ups, offering horizontally extended levels. Unlike most later {{games in}} the genre, the player could move in either direction. The game's use of scrolling helped remove design limitations associated with the screen, and though the game's minimap feature had been introduced before, Defender integrated it into the gameplay in a more essential manner. Konami's Scramble, released in 1981, is a side-scrolling shooter with forced scrolling. It was the first scrolling shooter to offer multiple, distinct levels. Atari's Tempest, released in 1981, {{is one of the}} earliest tube shooters <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> attempt to incorporate a 3D perspective into shooter games. Tempest ultimately went on to influence major rail shooters.|$|E
5|$|In {{their fourth}} {{game of the}} 2012 season, Alabama {{defeated}} the Florida Atlantic Owls in their first all-time meeting by a final score of 40–7. The Crimson Tide scored on the third play of their first offensive possession when AJ McCarron connected with Kenny Bell for an 85-yard touchdown pass <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> 7–0 lead. After the Alabama defense held the Owls to a three-and-out on their first possession, the Crimson Tide took a 14–0 lead on their drive that ensued when McCarron threw a four-yard touchdown pass to DeAndrew White. After the defense again held FAU to a three-and-out, Christion Jones fumbled the punt that was recovered by the Owls' Tim Raber at the Alabama 25-yard line. After another defensive hold, Jesse Williams blocked the Vinny Zaccario field goal attempt to keep the score 14–0.|$|E

5|$|Kaʻauwai {{became an}} {{experienced}} fisherman, {{manager of the}} chief's canoes <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> physician. He worked as his headman or right-hand agent to Governor Hoapili and was effectively the Lieutenant Governor of Maui in all but name. In their first meeting in 1832, Reverend Richard Armstrong described how Hoapili trusted him with all his important business including accessing and collecting taxes, managing his property, and conducting tours of the island of Maui, and thus became a highly respected and well-loved official in the public view. In October 1851, the Privy Council of State, the advisory council for the king, recommended him {{as a candidate for}} the Governorship of Maui left vacant by the death of James Kānehoa Young, but the council eventually voted eight to three to recommended the appointment of Prince Lot Kapuāiwa (the future Kamehameha V) instead. However, Prince Lot never seem to have taken up this position either because Kānehoa's deputy Paul Nahaolelua remained acting governor until his own appointment in 1852.|$|E
5|$|Narayan became {{frustrated}} with his supporting role for vocalists {{and moved to}} Mumbai in 1949 to work independently in film music and recording. He recorded three solo 78rpm gramophone records for the British HMV Group in 1950 <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> ten-inch LP album in Mumbai in 1951, but the album was not in demand. The Mumbai film industry offered a good salary and obscurity for work that would have lowered his stature among classical musicians. For the next 15 years he played and composed songs for films, including Adalat, Gunga Jumna, Humdard, Kashmir Ki Kali, Madhumati, Milan, Mughal-e-Azam, and Noorjehan. He was considered a desired choice of film music director O. P. Nayyar.|$|E
5|$|On {{his way to}} the {{starting}} grid, Carlos Sainz Jr. stopped on track and had to be pushed back to pit lane, where he eventually started, only to retire after just a few hundred metres. At the start, both Mercedes drivers got away well and Hamilton tried to overtake Rosberg for the lead around the outside of the first corner, but were unable to do so. Jenson Button made a good start, moving from 16th to 13th, while Marcus Ericsson fell from 13th to 18th. Behind the leaders, the Ferrari drivers retained third and fourth place respectively. Bottas moved into fifth after moving around the outside. Hamilton was able to follow Rosberg closely in the opening laps, while Daniel Ricciardo was the first driver to pit for new tyres on lap four. One lap later, Grosjean was able to use drag reduction system (DRS) to overtake Felipe Nasr for eleventh. With his back row start <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> pit stop, Ricciardo overtook the two Manor Marussia cars around lap nine.|$|E
