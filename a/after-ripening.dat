50|$|As {{described}} in inventions of Sylvester L. Steffen, chillcuring is an electrical ventilating process that facilitates the photoelectric <b>after-ripening</b> of bulk stored seeds. The ventilation process {{is controlled by}} monitoring the wet-bulb temperature of air around the grain (as measured by evaporative cooling), by which the grain is brought to equilibrium moisture and temperature with atmospheric air. Seed dormancy is better maintained at cooler (chill) atmospheric temperatures, and grain weight and seed vigor are better preserved. The <b>after-ripening</b> of seeds is a biochemical process of carbohydrate/protein stabilization associated with the chemical release of water (H:OH), a reverse process of hydrolysis. The triatomic molecules of water and carbon dioxide are especially reactive in attenuating infrared light-spectrum waves, which provides energy necessary in photosynthesis and (curing) <b>after-ripening.</b> Infrared electrical heat is supplied by “grainlamps” so as to energize water vapor in the air under high humidity conditions.|$|E
50|$|Physiological {{dormancy}} prevents embryo {{growth and}} seed germination until chemical changes occur. These chemicals include inhibitors that often retard embryo growth {{to the point}} where it is not strong enough to break through the seed coat or other tissues. Physiological dormancy is indicated when an increase in germination rate occurs after an application of gibberellic acid (GA3) or after Dry <b>after-ripening</b> or dry storage. It is also indicated when dormant seed embryos are excised and produce healthy seedlings: or when up to 3 months of cold (0-10 °C) or warm (=15 °C) stratification increases germination: or when dry <b>after-ripening</b> shortens the cold stratification period required. In some seeds physiological dormancy is indicated when scarification increases germination.|$|E
50|$|A single Egyptian {{broomrape}} {{plant is}} capable of producing {{hundreds of thousands of}} extremely small (0.15-0.5 mm long) seeds. These seeds, dispersed by the wind, animals, or by more artificial means such as farm machinery, survive in the soil and have the ability to remain viable in the soil for more than 15 years. When the seeds are dropped, they are dormant. They require <b>after-ripening,</b> or further ripening after the seed has fallen from the plant, which is completed by the time the dry season has ended. As the rainy season begins, the seeds imbibe water and move into a conditioning phase which lasts 1-3 weeks, depending on whether the temperature remains optimal, between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit. At this point, the seeds only need a chemical signal from the roots of a host plant to germinate. The seeds can remain in this conditioned state for several months. If the seed never receives the chemical signal to germinate and dries out, it will return to its dormant state, ready to be re-conditioned when the next rainy season begins.|$|E

Fresh seeds, one week after harvest, did not germinate at temperatures above 10 ℃. Seeds <b>after-ripened</b> for more than 4 months germinated optimally at 15 ℃ or therabouts. However, even the seeds <b>after-ripened</b> for 28 months or more never geminated at 30 ℃. Exposure to 5 ℃ followed by 30 ℃ resulted in germination at 30 ℃ in regardless of the <b>after-ripened</b> period. Exposure to 15 ℃, referred to as chilling, followed by 30 ℃, or the reverse to 7 - 8 month-seeds resulted in qualitative and quantitative inhibition at 30 ℃, whereas exposing 31 - 32 month-seeds to alternating temperatures resulted in promotion of germination at 30 ℃. Diurnal thermoperiodic exposure of the seeds <b>after-ripened</b> for 8 months, chilling and 30 ℃, resulted in germination within a narrow time range of chilling from 16 h to 24 h, irrespective of the number of cycles. However, diurnal exposure to the seeds <b>after-ripened</b> for 32 months resulted in germination at a wider time range of chilling from 2 h to 24 h depending upon the number of cycles. The roles of low temperatures and high temperatures, and of their interaction on the germination of A. fatua seeds with particular regard to the <b>after-ripened</b> period are discussed. 5 ℃から 30 ℃の各種の一定温度，及び 5 ℃後の 30 ℃， 15 ℃後の 30 ℃或いは 30 ℃後の 15 ℃の温度変化に対す る野生エンバク（Avena fatua) の種子（えい果）の発芽反応を，収穫後の期間（後熟期間）が異なるる種子を用いて調べ た。 収穫後 1 週間の種子は， 10 ℃より高い温度で発芽しなかった。 4 か月以上経過した種子は 15 ℃，或いはその近く の温度で最も強く発芽した。しかし 24 か月以上の種子でも 30 ℃では発芽しなかった，即ち 2 次休眠に入った。 いずれの後熟期間の種子でも， 5 ℃の後 30 ℃に置くと短期間で発芽した。この結果は，発芽の初期過程は低温に よって誘導され，その後の過程は高温によって促進されることを示唆している。 15 ℃後の 30 ℃，或いはその逆の温度変化に対して， 7 － 8 か月の種子の発芽は， 30 ℃によって質的並びに量的に 抑制された。しかし，後熟期間が経過するにつれて， 30 ℃の抑制は減少し， 31 - 32 か月の種子の発芽は， 30 ℃に よってむしろ促進された。また， 15 ℃と 30 ℃の日周的温周期こ対して， 8 か月の種子は， 15 ℃が 16 時間から 24 時問 の狭い時間範囲でのみ発芽し，それ以下の時間では，この温周期の回数を増加しても発芽しなかった。これに対し て， 32 か月種子の発芽の時間範囲は温周期の回数の増加にともない広くなり， 6 回の温周期で， 2 時間から 24 時間の 範囲で発芽した。この実験結果は，短い後熟期間の種子の発芽過程では， 15 ℃と 30 ℃は相互に拮抗的に作用する が，長い後熟期間の種子の発芽過程では，この両者の温度は相助的に作用することを示唆している...|$|R

Seeds were hydrated at 100 % relative humidity for 0, 2, or 10 d at Weeks 1, 6, or 12 of <b>after-ripening.</b> Dormancy status was assessed after each hydration treatment by measuring seed germination at 12 -hourly alternating 25 / 15 C (light/dark) periods using seeds directly from the hydration treatment and seeds subjected to 4 d postpriming desiccation. Seeds exposed {{to one or more}} hydration events during the 12 wk were less dormant than seeds that remained dry throughout <b>after-ripening.</b> The longer hydration of 10 d promoted greater dormancy loss than either a 2 -d hydration or no hydration. For the seed lot that was most dormant {{at the start of the}} experiment, two or three rather than one hydration event or a hydration event earlier rather than later during <b>after-ripening</b> promoted greater dormancy release. These effects were not significant for the less-dormant seed lot. For both seed lots, the effect of a single hydration for 2 d at Week 1 or 6 of <b>after-ripening</b> was not manifested until the test at Week 12 of the experiment, suggesting that the hydration events alter the rate of dormancy release during subsequent <b>after-ripening.</b> A hydrothermal priming time model, usually used for modeling the effect of priming on germination rate of nondormant seeds, was successfully applied to dormancy release resulting from the hydration treatments...|$|E
40|$|<b>After-ripening</b> is the {{mechanism}} by which dormant seeds become nondormant during their dry storage after harvest. The absence of free water in mature seeds does not allow detectable metabolism; thus, the processes associated with dormancy release under these conditions are largely unknown.

In vitro approaches demonstrate that mRNA oxidation results in artifacts in cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphim analysis and alters protein translation. The oxidation of transcripts is not random but selective, and, using microarrays, we identified 24 stored mRNAs that became highly oxidized during <b>after-ripening.</b> Oxidized transcripts mainly correspond to genes involved in responses to stress and in cell signaling.

40|$|Physiologically dormant seeds, {{like those}} of Arabidopsis, will cycle through dormant states as seasons change until the {{environment}} is favourable for seedling establishment.

Full-genome microarrays were used for a global transcript analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana (accession Cvi) seeds {{in a range of}} dormant and dry <b>after-ripened</b> states during cycling. Principal component analysis of the expression patterns observed showed that they differed in newly imbibed primary dormant seeds, as commonly used in experimental studies, compared with those in the maintained primary and secondary dormant states that exist during cycling. Dormant and <b>after-ripened</b> seeds appear to have equally active although distinct gene expression programmes, dormant seeds having greatly reduced gene expression associated with protein synthesis, potentially controlling the completion of germination. A core set of 442 genes were identified that had higher expression in all dormant states compared with <b>after-ripened</b> states. Abscisic acid (ABA) responsive elements were significantly over-represented in this set of genes the expression of which was enhanced when multiple copies of the elements were present. ABA regulation of dormancy was further supported by expression patterns of key genes in ABA synthesis/catabolism, and dormancy loss in the presence of fluridone. The data support an ABA¿gibberelic acid hormone balance mechanism controlling cycling through dormant states that depends on synthetic and catabolic pathways of both hormones.

40|$|Germination of dormant Avena fatua seeds (caryopsis) at {{different}} temperatures was promoted partially by pricking the seed coat with pericarp or cutting intact seeds, suggesting that such treatments allow oxygen to permeate into {{the seeds and}} promote germination. Effects of exogenous gibberellin A 3 (GA 3), 2 -chloroethyl-trimethyl-ammonium chloride (CCC) and abscisic acid (ABA) on germination were examined with half cut seeds <b>after-ripened</b> for various months. GA 3 promoted the germination of highly dormant seeds but CCC inhibited that of slightly dormant seeds. ABA also inhibited the germination of slightly dormant seeds. The promotive effect of GA 3 decreased but the inhibitory effect of ABA increased in more highly dormant seeds or in the seeds maintained at higher temperatures. However, embryos isolated from the seeds at much highly dormant stage germinated well even at 30 ℃ {{in the presence of}} GA 3. 　These evidences suggest that the dormancy of A. fatua seeds occurs in combination　with two　regulatory events. First, an anaerobic condition around the embryo occurs within fresh seeds. The anaerobic degree is gradually reduced with the increase in <b>after-ripened</b> months. Second, different level of endogenous ABA and gibberellins (GAs) is invotved; high ABA level and low GAs level are in fresh seeds and/or at high temperature, whereas the converse is in seeds <b>after-ripened</b> for many months and/or at lower temperature. 野生エンバク (Avena fatua) の休眠中の種子（えい果）の種皮（果皮と種皮）に小さい穴をあけるか，横半分に切断す ると，各種温度における発芽を促進された。この処理によって酸素の種皮透過が容易になり，発芽が促進されること を示唆している。 収穫後の各種の期間（後熟期間）の種子，即ち休眠の程度が異なる種子の発芽に及ぼす外生ジベレリンA 3 （GA 3 ）， ジベレ リン生合成阻害剤のCCCおよびアブシジン酸（ABA）の作用を，半分に切断した種子を用いて調べた。GA 3 は，後熟期間が短い，深い休眠種子の発芽を促進し，CCCは，後熟期間が長い，浅い休眠種子の発芽を抑制した。 ABAもまた浅い休眠種子の発芽を抑制した。しかし，GA 3 の促進作用は休眠の深い種子，または高温では減少し， ABAの抑制作用は増加した。しかし，分離した胚の発芽は，GA 3 によって著しく促進され 30 ℃の高温でも発芽し た。 上記の実験結果は，野生エンバク種子の休眠の原因は二つの事柄が関係していることを示唆している。第 1 は，短い後熟期間の種子の胚の周辺は嫌気的な状態にあり，この程度は，後熱期間の経過につれて減少する。第 2 は，内生 植物ホルモンの量的レベルあるいはその作用的変化である。短い後熱期間の種子あるいは高温では，ABA抑制の作 用が優勢的である。しかし，長い後熱期間の種子あるいは低温では，ジベレ リンの促進作用と拮抗してABAの抑制 が減少する...|$|R

40|$|While {{widespread}} transcriptome {{changes were}} previously observed with seed dormancy loss, this study specifically characterized transcriptional changes {{associated with the}} increased seed dormancy and dormancy loss of the gibberellin (GA) hormone-insensitive sleepy 1 - 2 (sly 1 - 2) mutant. The SLY 1 gene encodes the F-box subunit of an SCF E 3 ubiquitin ligase needed for GA-triggered proteolysis of DELLA repressors of seed germination. DELLA overaccumulation in sly 1 - 2 seeds leads to increased dormancy that can be rescued without DELLA protein destruction either by overexpression of the GA receptor, GA-INSENSITIVE DWARF 1 b (GID 1 b-OE) (74 % germination) or by extended dry <b>after-ripening</b> (11 months, 51 % germination). <b>After-ripening</b> of sly 1 resulted in different transcriptional changes in early versus late Phase II of germination that {{were consistent with the}} processes known to occur. Approximately half of the transcriptome changes with <b>after-ripening</b> appear to depend on SLY 1 -triggered DELLA proteolysis. Given that many of these SLY 1 /GA-dependent changes are genes involved in protein translation, it appears that GA signaling increases germination capacity in part by activating translation. While sly 1 - 2 <b>after-ripening</b> was associated with transcript-level changes in 4594 genes over two imbibition timepoints, rescue of sly 1 - 2 germination by GID 1 b-OE was associated with changes in only 23 genes. Thus, a big change in sly 1 - 2 germination phenotype can occur with relatively little change in the global pattern of gene expression during the process of germination. Most GID 1 b-OE-responsive transcripts showed similar changes with <b>after-ripening</b> in early Phase II of imbibition, but opposite changes with <b>after-ripening</b> by late Phase II.

In this study, genotypic variation in ABA contents at Zadok’s Growth Stage 92 (ZGS 92), tempo-ral changes in ABA during two physiological stages (<b>after-ripening</b> and water uptake), and responsiveness of wheat seed to applied ABA at different concentrations, of two tetraploid and two hexaploid wheat genotypes were examined during 1996 and 97. A combined analysis of variance indicated no significant differences in ABA among geno-types at ZGS 92. During the early stages of germination, endogenous ABA in the caryop-ses of the four wheat genotypes was analyzed. The results showed a transient increase in ABA content (up to 4 hours) occurring first during imbibition, followed by a decline up to 12 hours and an increase thereafter. ABA declined in all genotypes during seven weeks of <b>after-ripening</b> (dry storage). The four genotypes had reductions in ABA up to 4 weeks of <b>after-ripening.</b> An increase in ABA was observed during the fourth and fifth weeks of af-ter-ripening with a decline after seven weeks.

Dormancy release was more rapid for seeds <b>after-ripened</b> in the field compared with those <b>after-ripened</b> dry in a greenhouse. Seed decay was found to be an important contributor to the loss of seeds for this species from the seed bank in the field. Seed decay was much greater for seeds <b>after-ripened</b> on the soil surface compared with buried seed. In contrast, germination {{played an important role in}} the loss of buried seed as compared with surface seed. Regardless of the burial depth, the dormant seed component present at the end of the growing season was quite small (4 to 16 %). Seedling emergence of rigid ryegrass in the field was greater (49 %) for seeds buried at 1 cm than for those on the soil surface (16 %). No seedlings emerged from seeds buried at 10 cm. Seed germination of rigid ryegrass was tolerant to a wide range of pH and showed some tolerance to salt and osmotic stress.

40|$|Plant embryos {{can survive}} {{years in a}} desiccated, {{quiescent}} state within seeds. In many species, seeds are dormant and unable to germinate at maturity. They acquire the capacity to germinate {{through a period of}} dry storage called <b>after-ripening</b> (AR), a biological process that occurs at 5 – 15 % moisture when most metabolic processes cease. Because stored transcripts are among the first proteins translated upon water uptake, they likely impact germination potential. Transcriptome changes associated with the increased seed dormancy of the GA-insensitive sly 1 - 2 mutant, and with dormancy loss through long sly 1 - 2 <b>after-ripening</b> (19 months) were characterized in dry seeds. The SLY 1 gene was needed for proper down-regulation of translation-associated genes in mature dry seeds, and for AR up-regulation of these genes in germinating seeds. Thus, sly 1 - 2 seed dormancy may result partly from failure to properly regulate protein translation, and partly from observed differences in transcription factor mRNA levels. Two positive regulators of seed dormancy, DELLA GAI (GA-INSENSITIVE) and the histone deacetylase HDA 6 /SIL 1 (MODIFIERS OF SILENCING 1) were strongly AR-down-regulated. These transcriptional changes appeared to be functionally relevant since loss of GAI function and application of a histone deacetylase inhibitor led to decreased sly 1 - 2 seed dormancy. Thus, <b>after-ripening</b> may increase germination potential over time by reducing dormancy-promoting stored transcript levels. Differences in transcript accumulation with <b>after-ripening</b> correlated to differences in transcript stability, such that stable mRNAs appeared AR-up-regulated, and unstable transcripts AR-down-regulated. Thus, relative transcript levels may change with dry <b>after-ripening</b> partly as a consequence of differences in mRNA turnover...|$|E

Experimental results unambiguously demonstrated that qSD 12 functions in the offspring tissue(s) and suggested that qSD 7 - 1 may control dormancy through the maternal tissues. These experiments also provide the first solid evidence that an offspring tissue-imposed dormancy gene contributes to the segregation distortion in a mapping population developed from partially <b>after-ripened</b> seeds and, in part, to the germination heterogeneity of seeds from hybrid plants. Offspring and maternal tissue-imposed dormancy genes express in very early and late stages of the life cycle, respectively, and interact to provide the species with complementary adaptation strategies. The qSD 12 locus was narrowed to the region of ∼ 600 kbp on a high-resolution map to facilitate cloning and marker-assisted selection of the major dormancy gene...|$|R
40|$|Background: Seed dormancy, {{defined as}} the incapability of a viable seed to {{germinate}} under favourable conditions, is an important trait in nature and agriculture. Despite extensive research on dormancy and germination, many questions about the molecular mechanisms controlling these traits remain unanswered, likely due to its genetic complexity and the large environmental effects which are characteristic of these quantitative traits. To boost research towards revealing mechanisms in the control of seed dormancy and germination we depend on the identification of genes controlling those traits. Methods: We used transcriptome analysis combined with a reverse genetics approach to identify genes that are prominent for dormancy maintenance and germination in imbibed seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana. Comparative transcriptomics analysis was employed on freshly harvested (dormant) and <b>after-ripened</b> (AR; non-dormant) 24 -h imbibed seeds of four different DELAY OF GERMINATION near isogenic lines (DOGNILs) and the Landsberg erecta (Ler) wild type with varying levels of primary dormancy. T-DNA knock-out lines of the identified genes were phenotypically investigated for their effect on dormancy and AR. Results: We identified conserved sets of 46 and 25 genes which displayed higher expression in seeds of all dormant and all <b>after-ripened</b> DOGNILs and Ler, respectively. Knock-out mutants in these genes showed dormancy and germination related phenotypes. Conclusions: Most of the identified genes had not been implicated in seed dormancy or germination. This research will be useful to further decipher the molecular mechanisms by which these important ecological and commercial traits are regulated...|$|R
40|$|Dormant {{seeds of}} Avena fatua, {{which do not}} {{germinate}} when allowed to imbibe water, have a respiration rate only about 20 % {{less than that of}} imbibed nondormant (<b>after-ripened)</b> seeds in the period before actual germination and are capable of synthesizing protein at a rate comparable to that of the nondormant seeds. An increase of protein synthesis is observed in nondormant seeds at the beginning of root protrusion. Autoradiography of seeds administered 3 H-leucine shows that protein synthesis occurs in the axis part of the embryo, the scutellum, the coleorhiza, and the aleurone layer. Dormancy in seeds is not a state of general inactivity; rather, it must be due to some specific metabolic block...|$|R
40|$|Primary seed {{dormancy}} {{is an important}} adaptive plant trait whereby seed germination is blocked under conditions {{that would otherwise be}} favorable for germination. This trait is found in newly produced mature seeds of many species, but not all. Once produced, dry seeds undergo an aging time period, called dry <b>after-ripening,</b> during which they lose primary dormancy and gradually acquire the capacity to germinate when exposed to favorable germination conditions. Primary {{seed dormancy}} has been extensively studied not only for its scientific interest but also for its ecological, phenological, and agricultural importance. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying primary seed dormancy and its regulation during <b>after-ripening</b> remain poorly understood. Here we review the principal developmental stages where primary dormancy is established and regulated prior to and during seed <b>after-ripening,</b> where it is progressively lost. We attempt to identify and summarize what is known about the molecular and genetic mechanisms intervening over time in each of these stages...|$|E
40|$|White light {{strongly}} promotes dormancy in freshly harvested cereal grains, whereas {{dark and}} <b>after-ripening</b> {{have the opposite}} effect. We have analyzed the interaction of light and <b>after-ripening</b> on abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellin (GA) metabolism genes and dormancy in barley (Hordeum vulgare ‘Betzes’). Analysis of gene expression in imbibed barley grains shows that different ABA metabolism genes are targeted by white light and <b>after-ripening.</b> Of the genes examined, white light promotes the expression of an ABA biosynthetic gene, HvNCED 1, in embryos. Consistent with this result, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays show that dormant grains imbibed under white light have higher embryo ABA content than grains imbibed in the dark. <b>After-ripening</b> {{has no effect on}} expression of ABA biosynthesis genes, but promotes expression of an ABA catabolism gene (HvABA 8 ′OH 1), a GA biosynthetic gene (HvGA 3 ox 2), and a GA catabolic gene (HvGA 2 ox 3) following imbibition. Blue light mimics the effects of white light on germination, ABA levels, and expression of GA and ABA metabolism genes. Red and far-red light have no effect on germination, ABA levels, or HvNCED 1. RNA interference experiments in transgenic barley plants support a role of HvABA 8 ′OH 1 in dormancy release. Reduced HvABA 8 ′OH 1 expression in transgenic HvABA 8 ′OH 1 RNAi grains results in higher levels of ABA and increased dormancy compared to nontransgenic grains...|$|E
40|$|Methods {{to break}} seed {{dormancy}} are {{of great interest}} to plant propagators, with many papers on this topic presented at past I. P. P. S. meetings. For example, in Vol. 54 of our Combined Proceedings of the International Plant Propagators’ Society, there were reports on embryo culture to avoid dormancy (Douglas, 2004) and recommendations on dormancy-breaking techniques for Helleborus (Bush, 2004), Salvia (Navarez, 2004), and many wildflowers and grasses native to the North Central U. S. A. (Diboll, 2004). As propagators, we typically want quick methods that consistently result in high germination rates without large labor inputs. But if we can afford to be more patient, some seeds may eliminate their primary dormancy mechanisms during storage. This progressive loss of dormancy after maturity in “air-dry” seeds is known as <b>after-ripening</b> (Murdoch and Ellis, 2000). Typically, <b>after-ripening</b> is thought to occur under warm, dry conditions (Foley, 2000; Probert, 2000), but the literature of <b>after-ripening</b> is somewhat confusing. Simpson (1990) defined <b>after-ripening</b> in a more general way as “loss of the dormant state over some period of time through exposure of the seeds to a set of environmental conditions after maturation and separation from the parent plant. ” The term has even been used to describe combinations of warm storage and the effects of stratification (Baskin and Baskin, 1988) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} colors of bell peppers are green, yellow, orange and red. More rarely, brown, white, lavender, and dark purple peppers can be seen, {{depending}} on the variety. Most typically, unripe fruits are green or, less commonly, pale yellow or purple. Red bell peppers are simply ripened green peppers, although the Permagreen variety maintains its green color even when fully ripe. Green peppers are less sweet and slightly more bitter than yellow or orange peppers, with red bell peppers being the sweetest. The taste of ripe peppers can also vary with growing conditions and post-harvest storage treatment; the sweetest fruits are allowed to ripen fully on the plant in full sunshine, while fruit harvested green and <b>after-ripened</b> in storage is less sweet.|$|R
40|$|Differential display {{analysis}} using dormant and non-dormant Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh seeds {{resulted in a}} set of genes that were associated with either dormancy or germination. Expression of the germination-associated genes AtRPL 36 B and AtRPL 27 B, encoding two ribosomal proteins, was undetectable in the dry seed, low in dormant seed, and high under conditions that allowed completion of germination. Expression of these genes was also found to be light-regulated and to correlate with germination speed. Expression of the dormancy-associated genes ATS 2 and ATS 4, encoding a caleosin-like protein and a protein similar to a low-temperature-induced protein respectively, was high in the dry seed and decreased during germination. Expression of ATS 2 and ATS 4 was high in primary and secondary dormant seed but low in <b>after-ripened</b> or chilled seed. The expression of both genes was also light-regulated, but no relationship with temperature-dependent germination speed was found...|$|R
40|$|An {{anaerobic}} treatment released Pyrus malus L. cv Golden Delicious embryos from their primary dormancy. It also suppressed the inhibitory effect induced by exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) on <b>after-ripened</b> embryos. For {{the study of}} ABA metabolism, a two-step culture method was developed. Embryos in primary dormancy were cultivated aerobically {{in the presence of}} [14 C]ABA (first culture). Some were directly analyzed to evaluate metabolism of absorbed ABA. The remaining embryos were cultivated on moist cotton without ABA, either in aerobic or anaerobic conditions (second culture). The amounts of ABA and its metabolites were measured both in the embryos and the water-leachates. After the second culture, the embryos showed a spectacular decrease in ABA content, with no difference between anaerobic and aerobic cultures. The amount of ABA glucose ester increased slightly in aerobiosis but diminished markedly in anaerobiosis. Radioactivity of the butanol fraction, which corresponded to polar conjugates, decreased considerably in anaerobiosis, whereas it increased in aerobiosis...|$|R
