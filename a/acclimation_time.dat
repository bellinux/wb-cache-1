40|$|The passive {{flux meter}} (PFM) {{developed}} at the University of Florida is an innovative device that is inserted into a well {{in order to measure}} groundwater and contaminant flux. The in-situ device consists of an activated carbon matrix impregnated with known amounts of alcohols that are desorbed at rates proportional to the groundwater flux through the device. After exposure the sorbent is extracted to quantify the contaminant mass intercepted and the resident alcohol mass remaining. Since the alcohols employed in bioactive sites are degradable, studies were conducted to investigate biodegradation issues and microbial <b>acclimation</b> <b>times</b> in field application. Also, silver-impregnated activated carbon was compared to unamended activated carbon in batch and column studies to determine silver ion effects on degradation. The studies confirm degradation and microbial acclimation occurrence, and demonstrate that silver impregnated activated carbon does inhibit degradation.

40|$|In this paper, the {{biodegradation}} {{process of}} 4 -nitrophenol (4 NP) in a sequencing batch reactor has been investigated. Kinetic tests {{have been carried}} out on biomass grown on mixed substrate (4 NP plus biogenic substrate) both {{in the presence of a}} biogenic substrate fraction in the feed and with 4 NP as the sole carbon source. Removal kinetics for all tests is well described by the typical substrate inhibition pattern as predicted by the Haldane equation. In both sets, estimated kinetic parameters are very similar: no beneficial effect of the biogenic fraction is observed on the 4 NP removal while increasing trend of 4 NP maximum removal rate with the 4 NP/CODTOT ratio in the feed has been observed. This finding has been modelled by estimating the fraction of the total biomass involved in 4 NP biodegradation as a function of 4 NP concentration in the feed. High removal rates, short <b>acclimation</b> <b>times</b> and good settling characteristics of produced sludge (observed during the whole working period) confirm the suitability of periodic systems in enhancing the bacterial potentialities for biodegradation of xenobiotic compounds.

40|$|Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) is {{a serious}} pest of stored {{agricultural}} products {{and one of the}} most common insects found in grain storage and food processing facilities. Heat treatment has been revisited to control stored-product insects as a potential alternative to methyl bromide for disinfesting mills and food-processing facilities. The influence of acclimation of T. castaneum adults, pupae, larvae, and eggs to sublethal temperatures of 36, and 42 °C on their subsequent susceptibility to lethal temperature of 50 °C was respectively investigated. The acclimation of T. castaneum eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults to 36, and 42 °C significantly decreased their subsequent susceptibility to lethal high temperature of 50 °C. The influence of acclimation to 42 °C was significantly greater than that of acclimation to 36 °C. The most influential <b>acclimation</b> <b>times</b> at 42 °C for mortality of T. castaneum eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults were 15, 5, 5, and 5 h, respectively, and their corresponding mortality were 41. 24, 5. 59, 20. 19, and 4. 48 %, compared to 100 % mortality of T. castaneum eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults without acclimation when exposed to 50 °C for 35 min, respectively.

40|$|The {{quality and}} {{reproducibility}} of science has recently come under scrutiny, with criticisms spanning disciplines. In aquatic toxicology, behavioural tests are currently {{an area of}} controversy since inconsistent findings have been highlighted and attributed to poor quality science. The problem likely relates to limitations {{to our understanding of}} basic behavioural patterns, which can influence our ability to design statistically robust experiments yielding ecologically relevant data. The present study takes a first step towards understanding baseline behaviours in fish, including how basic choices in experimental design might influence behavioural outcomes and interpretations in aquatic toxicology. Specifically, we explored how fish acclimate to behavioural arenas and how different lengths of observation time impact estimates of basic swimming parameters (i. e., average, maximum and angular velocity). We performed a semi-quantitative literature review to place our findings {{in the context of the}} published literature describing behavioural tests with fish. Our results demonstrate that fish fundamentally change their swimming behaviour over <b>time,</b> and that <b>acclimation</b> and observational timeframes may therefore have implications for influencing both the ecological relevance and statistical robustness of behavioural toxicity tests. Our review identified 165 studies describing behavioural responses in fish exposed to various stressors, and revealed that the majority of publications documenting fish behavioural responses report extremely brief <b>acclimation</b> <b>times</b> and observational durations, which helps explain inconsistencies identified across studies. We recommend that researchers applying behavioural tests with fish, and other species, apply a similar framework to better understand baseline behaviours and the implications of design choices for influencing study outcomes.

30|$|Earlier {{research}} has shown that the silver perch would not spawn at a temperature below 24  °C in the natural environment and at a temperature below 23.3  °C under captive pond conditions (Lake 1967 a). The domesticated broodfish of the silver perch does not spawn naturally under the Gingin (Western Australia) pond conditions in temperatures ranging between 11 and 34  °C. However, after a single injection of HCG, the domesticated broodfish in this experiment spawned at 21  °C. This is in the range of temperatures (21 – 24  °C) within which silver perch spawned in Israel (Levavi-Sivan 2004), which are both lower than the spawning temperature of 25  °C as reported by (Rowland 1984). Hence, no evidence of spawning deterioration was observed in this experiment. This may indicate that the domesticated silver perch could have adapted to spawn under different ranges of temperature after long <b>time</b> <b>acclimation</b> in pond conditions.

The effects of a change of salinity were recorded immediately in the first hour and 24 h after change.

40|$|Understanding the {{physiological}} and behavioural mechanisms that limit species' distributions {{is essential to}} our understanding of species' evolutionary physiology, as well as our ability to predict differential impacts of climate change. Despite the re-emerging interest in physiological determinants of large-scale biogeographic patterns (macrophysiology), substantial knowledge gaps remain in our understanding of the drivers of differential evolution of physiological traits and the potential for these traits to limit species' ability to cope with climatic extremes. Ectotherms are of particular concern, because they make up most of the world's biodiversity (invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles, and plants) and are highly susceptible to spatial and temporal variation in thermal regimes. Problems in the relevant literature include; (i) Focus on {{the presence or absence of}} biogeographic patterns rather than their underlying mechanisms, (ii) Inadequate or inconsistent, assessment of phenotypic plasticity (acclimation potential) across studies used for meta-analyses, (iii) Limited knowledge on how behaviour modifies exposure to extremes, (iv) Under-appreciation of desiccation risk as a limiting factor in addition to thermal constraints, (v) Lack of studies on comprehensive sets of thermal traits within a phylogenetically and methodologically controlled frame work, and (vi) Lack of knowledge on which, of the many, traits affected by temperature are physiologically and geographically the most limiting to ectothermic organisms. In Chapter I, I use published data to review the validity of one of the most heavily debated biogeographic pattern, Rapoport's Rule, and its underlying mechanism, the Climatic Variability Hypothesis. I provide a novel approach to testing the Climatic Variability Hypothesis and show that it applies even to taxa that do not follow the pattern of Rapoport's Rule. In Chapter II, I describe the complete acclimation process of critical thermal minimum temperatures in tropical ectotherms to establish the length and extent of this process and assess the degree to which previous studies may underestimate thermal tolerances because of inconsistent, short <b>acclimation</b> <b>times.</b> I show that acclimation of lower thermal limits, which contribute substantially to estimates of thermal tolerance breadth, can take more than 16 weeks to complete, even in a tropical ectotherm with little natural exposure to cold conditions. Current estimates of thermal tolerance based on inconsistent, partial acclimation, consequently greatly bias our estimates of thermal tolerances. Chapter III examines how behavioural hydroregulation reduces exposure of "dry-skinned" ectotherms to conditions that promote high desiccation rates. Active hydroregulation is present in dry-skinned ectotherms from tropical rainforests and desiccation avoidance clashes with thermoregulation, placing individuals in thermally suboptimal conditions and likely reducing activity times in dry conditions. In Chapter IV, I provide a comprehensive study of inter- and intraspecific variation in fully acclimated thermal traits in a clade of small, dry-skinned ectotherms from Eastern Australia across a natural geographic gradient. Water loss rates, metabolic rates, critical thermal minima, thermoregulatory behaviour and performance parameters vary along the latitudinal gradient in temperature. However, upper thermal limits, although often used to predict vulnerability of tropical and temperate organisms to climate change, do not vary with latitude. Chapter V assesses interactions between thermoregulatory behaviour and thermal dependence of performance to establish how the former may buffer exposure to extremes. The combined effects of behavioural hydroregulation and thermoregulation may buffer species against environmental variability and enable them to occur in conditions far outside their physiological tolerance limits. While decreasing risk of overheating and desiccation, these behaviours may, however, greatly limit potential activity time and, therefore, fitness. Vulnerability of ectotherms to increasing temperatures may be determined by increases desiccation, as well as by impacts of reduced activity times and increased metabolic expenditure on species' energy budgets, rather than simply by risk of overheating. Substantial intraspecific variation in metabolic rate and lower thermal limit suggests strong selection pressures on these traits. Chapter VI considers which physiological or behavioural traits best predict species' potential to extend into climatic extremes. Metabolic compensation to cold and cold tolerance are the best predictors of species' potential to extend into colder regions, while physiological heat tolerance is not a significant predictor of mean or maximum air temperatures species extend into, but rather appears to predict tolerance to high radiation levels. Overheating is, therefore, likely to affect ectotherms through species' capacity to deal with high levels or frequency of exposure to radiation, rather than high ambient air temperatures. Water loss rates are a significant predictor of species' potential to extend into dry habitats, even in dry-skinned ectotherms, and are underappreciated in their relevance for species' vulnerability to climate change, which is predicted to not only increase temperatures, but also moisture deficit and frequency of drought. Future studies should assess variation in desiccation resistance across geographically and taxonomically broader scales to enhance our ability to predict impacts of climate change. This study provides fine-scale, novel insight into determinants of limits to species' current and future distribution and is the most comprehensive analysis of thermal trait variation in a taxon to date...|$|R

We identified strong seasonal and environmental controls on both photosynthesis and respiration by analysing the parameters of light response curves. Branch-level photosynthetic parameters showed a delayed response to temperature, and, at Kevo, they were well described by sigmoid functions {{of the state of}} acclimation (S). Temperature <b>acclimation</b> was slower (<b>time</b> constant, τ = 7 days) for maximum photosynthesis (βbr) than for quantum efficiency (αbr) (τ = 5 days). High temperature-independent values of the respiration parameter (γbr) during leaf and shoot expansion were consistent with associated higher growth respiration rates. The ratio γbr/βbr was positively related to temperature, a result consistent with substrate-induced variations in leaf respiration rates at the branch level. Differences in stand structure and within-site variation in the active period of C uptake determined the spatiotemporal patterns in net assimilation amongst branches.

Membrane fluidity measurements showed that cold-acclimated scallop membranes were more fluid than those of warm-acclimated animals. However, the order parameter of 5 -SASL was greatest during the first six days of the reduction in temperature, indicating a more rigid gill membrane structure. The fluidity of gill and hemocyte membranes were negatively correlated with the proportion of 20 : 5 n- 3 (r = - 0. 714, P < 0. 001, n = 24) and the unsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio (r = - 0. 775, P < 0. 05, n = 8) respectively in the lipids of these tissues. Acclimation to reduced temperature for a prolonged period resulted in an increase in polyunsaturated fatty acid and a decrease in monounsaturated fatty acid content, in particular 20 : 5 n- 3 and C₂₀ monoenoic fatty acids. Maximum changes in PL fatty acid levels required 15 - 21 days following acclimation to 5 °C. Scallop gill and hemocyte membranes underwent progressive changes in their membrane fluidity and fatty acid composition, an observation which is consistent with homeoviscous adaptation following a reduction in acclimation temperature...|$|R
40|$|Objective: With {{neonatal}} {{intensive care}} units (NICUs) evolving from multipatient wards toward family-friendly, single-family room units, the study objective was to compare satisfaction levels of families and health-care staff across these differing NICU facility designs. Study Design: This prospective study documented, by means of institutional review board-approved questionnaire survey protocols, the perceptions of parents and staff from two contrasting NICU environments. Result: Findings showed that demographic subgroups of parents and staff perceived {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of the two facility designs differently. Staff perceptions varied with previous experience, <b>acclimation</b> <b>time</b> and employment position, whereas parental perceptions revealed a naiveté bias through surveys of transitional parents with experience in both NICU facilities. Conclusion: Use of transitional parent surveys showed a subject naiveté bias inherent in perceptions of inexperienced parents. Grouping all survey participants demographically provided more informative interpretations of data, and revealed staff perceptions to vary with position, previous training and hospital experience...|$|E
40|$|Combined {{effects of}} {{enrichment}} procedure and non-fermentable acetate or fermentable glucose on system performance and bacterial community for pentachlorophenol (PCP) degradation in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) were determined in this study. Co-substrate and PCP were added into MFCs either simultaneously or sequentially. Simultaneous addition with glucose (simultaneous-glucose) achieved the shortest <b>acclimation</b> <b>time</b> {{and the most}} endurance to heavy PCP shock loads. Species of Alphaproteobacteria (simultaneous-acetate, 33. 9 %; sequential-acetate, 31. 3 %), Gammaproteobacteria (simultaneous-glucose, 44. 1 %) and Firmicutes (sequential-glucose, 31. 8 %) dominated the complex systems. The genus Sedimentibacter was found to exist in all the cases whereas Spirochaetes were merely developed in simultaneous-acetate and simultaneous-glucose. While Epsilonproteobacteria were only absent from sequential-acetate, simultaneous-glucose benefited {{to the evolution of}} Lentisphaerae. These results demonstrate simultaneous-glucose is a strategy for efficient system performance and the microbiological evidence can contribute to improving understanding of and optimizing PCP degradation in MFCs.

40|$|Species' {{tolerance}} limits determine {{their capacity to}} tolerate climatic extremes and limit their potential distributions. Interspecific variation in thermal tolerances is often proposed to indicate climatic vulnerability and is, therefore, the subject of many recent meta-studies on differential capacities of species from climatically different habitats to deal with climate change. Most studies on thermal tolerances do not acclimate animals or use inconsistent, and insufficient, acclimation times, limiting {{our knowledge of the}} shape, duration and extent of acclimation responses. Consequently patterns in thermal tolerances observed in meta-analyses, based on data from the literature are based on inconsistent, partial acclimation and true trends may be obscured. In this study we describe time-course of complete acclimation of critical thermal minima in the tropical ectotherm Carlia longipes and compare it to the average acclimation response of other reptiles, estimated from published data, to assess how much <b>acclimation</b> <b>time</b> may contribute to observed differences in thermal limits. Carlia longipes decreased their lower critical thermal limits by 2. 4 °C and completed 95 % of acclimation in 17 weeks. Wild populations did not mirror this acclimation process over the winter. Other reptiles appear to decrease cold tolerance more quickly (95 % in 7 weeks) and to a greater extent, with an estimated average acclimation response of 6. 1 °C. However, without data on tolerances after longer acclimation times available, our capacity to estimate final acclimation state is very limited. Based on the subset of data available for meta-analysis, much of the variation in cold tolerance observed in the literature can be attributed to <b>acclimation</b> <b>time.</b> Our results indicate that (i) acclimation responses can be slow and substantial, even in tropical species, and (ii) interspecific differences in acclimation speed and extent may obscure trends assessed in some meta-studies. Cold tolerances of wild animals are representative of cumulative responses to recent environments, while lengthy acclimation is necessary for controlled comparisons of physiological tolerances. Measures of inconsistent, intermediate acclimation states, as reported by many studies, represent neither the realised nor the potential tolerance in that population, are very likely underestimates of species' physiological capacities and may consequently be of limited value...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims to {{describe}} behavioural responses and welfare parameters for the physostome Atlantic salmon and physoclist Atlantic cod when out of neutral buoyancy at different degrees and periods of time. The background {{for this approach}} {{is to improve the}} culture conditions by fully submergence of the farming installations, as the water below 10 m depth often is more stable in terms of environmental factors such as temperature and current in addition to the lack of waves, which again opens for alternative sites in more exposed oceanic areas. Salmon were submerged in large-scale fully submersible cages at depths between 4 to 15 m for 22 days (Paper I) and 10 to 25 m for 42 days (Paper II) under different light conditions and at various times of year. The behaviour of individual salmon in a school under submerged conditions was studied to reveal whether a range of coping abilities among individuals exists during the new and more challenging conditions (Paper III). Atlantic cod in an experimental submersible cage were raised from five different starting depths (between 30 and 8 m) and lowered from surface position to 10 m, 20 m and 30 m to test a protocol for safe lifting and lowering steps. Based on the behavioural responses, safe <b>acclimation</b> <b>times</b> before the next vertical step at high and low sea temperatures were identified (Paper IV). In Papers I and II, the general patterns of swimming depth and schooling density were studied at group level using echo-sounders in addition to swimming speed and swimming angle based on instantaneous observations with underwater cameras. Welfare parameters were defined as weight gain, feed intake, feed utilisation and fin and vertebral condition during the experimental period. The behaviour of individual salmon was studied by monitoring the swimming depth and body temperature using data storage tags implanted in randomly selected fish. Whether the development of diel vertical migration (DVM) activity during feeding was linked with individual growth rates was analysed to study individual coping styles. The immediate response and recovery time after lifting and lowering of Atlantic cod were estimated through measurements of swimming speed, swimming tail beat rate and swimming angle based on underwater camera recordings, and additionally by echo-sounder data obtained from resting fish on the net-floor (Paper IV). Atlantic salmon submerged without the opportunity to refill their swim bladder lost gas steadily over time, and the bladder was empty after about three weeks (Papers I and II). Swimming speeds were elevated on the first day after submergence and schooling became more structured (more constant speed and a greater distance to neighbouring fish). The diurnal vertical swimming pattern for the salmon in spring was broadly similar to that observed prior to submergence, as the artificial underwater lighting allowed the salmon to keep high swimming speed and lift during night (Paper III). In contrast, about 90 % of the salmon submerged below 10 m during the dark winter reversed their diurnal pattern from swimming at shallow depths at night and deeper during the day to swimming deep at night and shallower during the day (reversed DVM) or to swimming with a normal or reversed diurnal pattern on different days (irregular). A separation of faster- and slower-growing salmon also gradually appeared, where the faster-growing individuals occupied the deeper part of the water column. This situation occurred also at night {{at the end of the}} experiment among the salmon given continuous light (Paper III). Growth was clearly reduced in the salmon that were submerged during the winter, with more injuries recorded on their fins and snout. Slightly compressed vertebrae in the tail region were also observed, probably due to their tilted head-up tail-down swimming angle during the dark nights (Paper II). Lifting farmed cod from five different start depths, equivalent to a 40 % pressure reduction, resulted in strong downwards swimming movements dependent on the water temperature (Paper IV). The depth before cage lifting affected the immediate response, as the fish became more active after lifting events from shallow compared to deeper depths. Appetite decreased after lifting, but loss of behavioural control was never observed. During the subsequent 8 - 10 hr recovery periods, swimming activity gradually decreased to the same level as before lifting. The overall recovery time did not depend on start depth or temperature. Independent of final depth or temperature, rapid lowering of cod only resulted in a moderate short-term increase in upwards swimming movements, while appetite was less affected than after lifting. A compressed swim bladder after descents from the surface to 10 - 30 m leads to negative buoyancy, which required 18 - 90 h to re-fill by gas secretion, which is a temperature-related process (Paper IV). In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates that air gulping is a behavioural need for Atlantic salmon, and that long term denial of surface access will reduce their welfare Atlantic cod cope well in fully submerged cages, but 40 % pressure reduction is near the upper limit for lifts of healthy farmed cod. Secondary lifts should not be done until at least 10 h after the first lift. Cage lowering should be done slowly to avoid potentially stressful crowding of negatively buoyant fish on the cage bottom, especially at low temperatures...|$|R

BiologyBibliography: leaves 80 - 90 The {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} and fluidity of gill phospholipids and hemocyte membranes of a eurytherrnal bivalve, Placopecten magellanicus, were investigated following a 10 °C reduction in <b>acclimation</b> temperature. The <b>time</b> {{course of the}} acclimation response from 15 to 5 °C was also monitored over a 21 -day period. Membrane physical properties were measured {{by means of an}} electron spin resonance (ESR) spin-labeling technique, using 5 - doxyl stearic acid (5 -SASL) as a probe. Changes in the fluidity of gill membranes were analyzed by incorporating 5 -SASL into vesicles made from total gill phospholipid (PL). Membrane fluidity measurements showed that cold-acclimated scallop membranes were more fluid than those of wann-acclimated animals. However, the order parameter of 5 -SASL was greatest during the first six days of the reduction in temperature, indicating a more rigid gill membrane structure. The fluidity of gill and hemocyte membranes were negatively correlated with the proportion of 20 : 5 n- 3 (r = - 0. 714, P < 0. 001, n = 24) and the unsaturated to saturated fetty acid ratio (r = - 0. 775, P < 0. 05, n = 8) respectively in the lipids of these tissues. Acclimation to reduced temperature for a prolonged period resulted in an increase in polyunsaturated fatty acid and a decrease in monounsaturated fatty acid content, in particular 20 : 5 n- 3 and Qq monoenoic fatty acids. Maximum changes in PL fatty acid levels required 15 - 21 days following acclimation to 5 °C.

40|$|The present {{work has}} {{explored}} {{for the first}} <b>time</b> <b>acclimation</b> of upper versus lower canopy leaves along an altitudinal gradient. We tested the hypothesis that restrictive climatic conditions associated with high altitudes reduce within-canopy variations of leaf traits. The investigated beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest {{is located on the}} southern slope of the Hrubý Jeseník Mountains (Czech Republic). All measurements were taken on leaves from upper and lower parts of the canopy of mature trees (> 85 years old) growing at low (400  m above sea level, a. s. l.), middle (720  m a. s. l.) and high (1100  m a. s. l.) altitudes. Compared with trees at higher altitudes, those growing at low altitudes had lower stomatal conductance, slightly lower CO 2 assimilation rate (Amax) and leaf mass per area (LMA), and higher photochemical reflectance index, water-use efficiency and Rubisco content. Given similar stand densities at all altitudes, the different growth conditions result in a more open canopy and higher penetration of light into lower canopy with increasing altitude. Even though strong vertical gradients in light intensity occurred across the canopy at all altitudes, lower canopy leaves at high altitudes tended to acquire the same morphological, biochemical and physiological traits as did upper leaves. While elevation had no significant effect on nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) contents per unit leaf area, LMA, or total content of chlorophylls and epidermal flavonoids in upper leaves, these increased significantly in lower leaves at higher altitudes. The increases in N content of lower leaves were coupled with similar changes in Amax. Moreover, a high N content coincided with high Rubisco concentrations in lower but not in upper canopy leaves. Our results show that the limiting role of light in lower parts of the canopy is reduced at high altitudes. A great capacity of trees to adjust the entire canopy is thus demonstrated...|$|R
