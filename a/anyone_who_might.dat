25|$|Goldman {{also claimed}} that when Lennon started making music again in 1980 {{following}} a long hibernation, {{he was not}} immune to Manhattan's cocaine-fueled disco scene.

Goldman did not cite a single name of <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>might</b> have witnessed this at the studio. Goldman alleged further that on December 8, 1980 (the day of Lennon's murder) not only did the singer's cocaine snorting warrant plastic surgery, but he was in such bad physical condition from drug abuse and lack of exercise that during his autopsy the medical examiner recorded observations to that effect, overlooking the four bullet wounds momentarily.|$|E

Robin killed her to prevent her from telling <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>might</b> recognise the photo, and framed Bentley by stealing the £30, correctly assuming Bentley would incriminate himself by panicking.

The Lewinsky portion of the investigation included the secret taping of conversations between Lewinsky and coworker Linda Tripp, requests by Starr to tape Lewinsky's conversations with Clinton, and requests by Starr to compel Secret Service agents to testify about what they might have seen while guarding Clinton. With the investigation of Clinton's possible adultery, critics of Starr believed that he had crossed a line and was acting more as a political hit man than as a prosecutor.|$|E

He continued {{his study of}} orchids throughout the summer, writing to <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>might</b> be able to supply specimens {{he had not yet}} examined. Field naturalists, botanists, and country gentry sent specimens from across the British Isles. Darwin also tramped around the countryside with tin cans and biscuit boxes, collecting specimens which his gardeners potted up for him. His family joined in, and neighbours contributed to the research. As he had only a cold greenhouse, a friend {{on the other side of}} the village who had a hot-house allowed him to use that, and offered the services of his gardener to look after the delicate specimens. Darwin's aim was to show how the complex structures and life cycles of the plants could be explained by natural selection rather than by the handiwork of God; he saw the huge variety of flowers as a collection of ad hoc evolutionary adaptations. In June he described his examination of bee orchids as a passion, and his findings on insect fertilisation of orchids as [...] "beautiful facts".|$|E
