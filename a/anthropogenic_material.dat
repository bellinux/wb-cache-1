Localities were choosen with the aim to follow an urbanization gradient {{from the center of}} the city, through its periphery to small villages.

Detrimental effects of terrestrial plastic could be most pronounced in intensively human-modified landscapes (e. g., urban and agricultural areas), which are a source of much anthropogenic debris. Here, we examine the occurrence, types, landscape associations, and consequences of anthropogenic nest material in the American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos), a North American species that breeds in both urban and agricultural landscapes. We monitored 195 nestlings in 106 nests across an urban and agricultural gradient in the Sacramento Valley, California, USA. We found that 85. 2 % of crow nests contained <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>material,</b> and 11 of 195 nestlings (5. 6 %) were entangled in their nests. The length of the material was greater in nests in agricultural territories than in urban territories, and the odds of entanglement increased 7. 55 times for each meter of <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>material</b> in the nest. Fledging success was significantly lower for entangled than for unentangled nestlings.

40|$|Nests are a {{critically}} {{important factor in}} determining the breeding success of many species of birds. Nevertheless, we have surprisingly little understanding of how local environment helps shape materials used in construction, how this differs among related species using similar nest sites, or if materials used directly or indirectly influence the numbers of offspring successfully reared. We also have little understanding of any potential links between nest construction and the assemblage of invertebrates which inhabit the nest and in particular, with ectoparasites. We addressed these questions by monitoring the success rates of nest-box using Blue Tits Cyanistes caeruleus and Great Tits Parus major, from rural, urban greenspace and urban garden settings. We collected used nests, identified arthropods present, and measured the proportions of highly processed anthropogenic materials used in their construction. Some 25 % of Great Tit nest materials were of an anthropogenic source and this was consistent across habitats, while Blue Tits used little (1 - 2 %) except in gardens (~ 16 %), suggesting that Great Tits preferentially sought out these materials. In fledged nests, increasing use of <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>material</b> was associated with lower general arthropod diversity and ectoparasite predator abundance (Blue Tits only) but higher levels of Siphonapterans (fleas). Higher arthropod diversity was associated with lower flea numbers, suggesting that increased diversity {{played a role in}} limiting flea numbers. No direct link was found between breeding success and either <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>material</b> usage, or arthropod diversity and abundance. However, breeding success declined with increasing urbanisation in both species and increased with nest weight in Blue Tits.

40|$|Canals are {{artificial}} waterways, {{which are}} distinct from natural aquatic systems. As {{a result of}} their industrial heritage they have experienced high loadings of <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>material,</b> and consequently their sediments tend to have a bulk composition that is distinct from natural sediment. It is therefore expected that the geochemical behaviour of canal sediment may deviate significantly from that of natural sediment. This study investigates and contrasts the geochemistry and petrology of a rural and urban canal sediment, {{in order to determine the}} influence of <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>material</b> upon the urban sediment and to gain an understanding of the diagenetic processes operating within the sediments. Sediment cores were collected from an urban canal in Birmingham and a rural canal in Leicestershire. The cores were analysed at 1 cm intervals in order to build up 24 cm depth profiles of their bulk chemistry, metal speciation and porewater chemistry. The petrology of both the sediments was analysed by CryoSEM in order to determine their in situ petrology. The results have shown that the introduction of <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>material</b> to the urban canal has produced sediment that is chemically and mineralogically distinct from natural sediments. The bulk urban sediment contains elevated metal and organic matter loadings, and a significant proportion of its particulate matter is of anthropogenic origin (e. g. slag, fly ash, metal turnings) and is therefore not typical of clastic material in natural sediments. Rural sediment has not been subject to inputs of such material and therefore it has a bulk chemistry of natural materials such as clay, sand, silt and organic matter which is similar to that which is typically observed in natural sediments. The petrological investigation of rural and urban canal sediment has shown that they have distinct authigenic mineralogies. The reduced iron phosphate, vivianite (Fe 3 (P 04) 2. 8 H 20) is the most abundant authigenic mineral in urban sediment, as a result of its elevated organic matter and iron concentrations, while in the rural sediment, pyrite (F eS 2) is predominant. In order to choose an appropriate scheme for the investigation of speciation in contaminated urban canal sediment, two different sequential extraction schemes were investigated by CryoSEM. The results revealed that they do not yield meaningful speciation results for urban canal sediment. In particular, the application of an oxalic acid buffer to extract oxides resulted in the formation of insoluble oxalates, and the exhaustion of the pH buffering capacity of the extraction reagents used to extract carbonates, resulted in the incomplete dissolution of calcite. The abundance of non-typical sediment components in urban canal sediment highlights the importance of investigating sediment mineralogy prior to the application of sequential extraction techniques. The porewater chemistry was in broad agreement with the observed petrology and, in the case of the urban site, the data provides evidence of sediment disturbance. The periodic resuspension of the sediment by boat traffic results in a significant change to the surface porewater chemistry of iron and sulphate in the urban sediment and results in changes to the stability of certain authigenic phases, most notably vivianite. In the rural sediment, although physical disturbance of the sediment was observed, there was no chemical evidence in the porewater results. However, it does perhaps subtly enhance the organic matter degradation processes that are occurring, although this could not be confirmed by the results of this investigation. The differences in the authigenic mineral assemblages of rural and urban canal sediment are the result of differences in their diagenetic paths. In the rural sediment, the relatively low organic matter and iron loadings result in a diagenesis dominated by sulphate and iron reduction; the abundance of pyrite in this sediment is evidence that sulphate reduction is the predominant process. In the urban sediment, the co-existence of vivianite and iron monosulphides implies that iron reduction is dominating the oxidation of organic matter in the sediment and occurring simultaneously with sulphate reduction. The application of conceptual models of diagenesis, based on porewater studies of natural sediments, can be used to adequately describe the processes that are occurring in the rural canal sediment. However, the periodic physical disturbance and influx of material to urban canal sediment from pollution events prevents the development of steady state conditions. As a result of this, and the nature of the solid material, the diagenetic path observed in the urban sediment is quite distinct from that observed in natural sediments, and simple steady state models are inappropriate for its interpretation...|$|E

Following the theoretical framework as defined in a first part, a tentative PSUT for the Netherlands 2006 is presented as a case study (being validated). Such an approach could constitute a major advance for the practice of compiling PSUTs before deriving PIOTs, since it aims to remove the necessity of manually tracing conflicting information.
