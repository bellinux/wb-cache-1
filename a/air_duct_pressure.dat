40|$|Building {{technology}} has been developed due to the improvement of information technology. Specifically, a human can control and monitor the building operation {{by a number of}} sensors and actuators. The sensors and actuators are installed on every single element in a building. Thus, the large stream of building data allows us to implement both quantitative and qualitative improvements. However, there are still limitations to mapping between the physical building element and cyber system. To solve this mapping issue, last summer, a text mining methodology was developed as part of a project conducted by the Consortium for Building Energy Innovation. Building data was extracted from building 661, in Philadelphia, PA. The ground truth of the building data point with semantic information was labeled by manual inspection. And a Support Vector Machine was implemented to investigate the relationship between the data point name and the semantic information. This algorithm achieves 93 % accuracy with unseen building 661 data points. Techniques and lessons were gained from this project, and this knowledge was used to develop the framework for analyzing the building data from the Gates Hillman Center (GHC) building, Pittsburgh PA. This new framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, we initially tried to cluster the data points by similar semantic information, using the hierarchical clustering method. However, the effectiveness and accuracy of the clustering method is not adequate for this framework. Thus, the filtering and classification model is developed to identify the semantic information of the data points. From the filtering and classification method, it correctly identifies the damper position and supply <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> <b>pressure</b> data point with 90 % accuracy by daily statistical features. Having the semantic information from the first stage, the second stage figures out the relationship between Variable Air Volume (VAV) terminal units and Air Handling Units (AHU). The intuitive thermal and flow relationship between VAVs and AHUs are investigated at the beginning, and the statistical features clustering method is applied from the VAV discharge temperature data. However, the control strategy of this building makes this relationship invisible. Alternatively we then compared the similarity between damper position at VAVs and supply <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> <b>pressure</b> at AHUs by calculating the cross correlation. Finally, this similarity scoring method achieved 80 % accuracy to map the relationship between VAVs and AHUs. The suggested framework will guide the user to find the desired information such as the VAVs – AHUs relationship from the problem generated by a large number of heterogeneous sensor networks by using data-driven methodology...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} improved control {{strategies for}} dual-duct single-fan variable air volume (VAV) systems. Common control strategy for supply air volume modulation is evaluated, and an improved air volume control strategy that maintains separate cold and hot <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> static <b>pressure</b> set points is presented. The paper also explores {{the interactions between}} the cold and hot deck temperatures and <b>duct</b> static <b>pressures,</b> and discusses the impact of non-ideal deck temperature settings on <b>duct</b> static <b>pressures</b> and overall system energy consumption. To compensate {{the negative impact of}} non-ideal cold and hot deck temperature set points, the authors propose using real-time <b>duct</b> static <b>pressure</b> readings as feedback signals to fine-tune the deck temperature set points. These new control schemes can reduce simultaneous cooling and heating while reducing fan power consumption...|$|R
40|$|As for a {{variable}} air volume (VAV) system, the <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> static <b>pressure</b> {{is a typical}} control variable maintained by modulating supply fan speed. The static pressure equals to the summation of the <b>duct</b> <b>pressure</b> loss downstream of the sensor to the terminal box and box inlet static <b>pressure.</b> Typically, the <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> static <b>pressure</b> is set as a constant set point based on the system design information and sensor location. However, under partial load conditions, the terminal box dampers have to be closed more since either required airflow {{is less than the}} design airflow which directly leads to much less pressure loss. Thus the static pressure set point should be reset lower in order to reduce fan power, avoid noise at terminal box dampers and box damper malfunction due to excessive pressure. Different static pressure reset schedules are reviewed and compared, considering the influence of outside air temperature on the building load, availability of the VAV box damper positions, the airflow ratio based static pressure reset has also applicable advantages over the existing constant static pressure set point and two typical reset methods. This paper present the theoretical models to express the impacts of static pressure reset on fan airflow, fan head, air leakage, fan power and thermal energy for both pressure independent and pressure dependent boxes. The impacts are also demonstrated using the parametric analysis and numerical results to show the benefits of the static pressure reset including reducing fan power, cooling energy and heating energy...|$|R
40|$|A data-mining {{approach}} for the optimization of a HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system is presented. A predictive {{model of the}} HVAC system is derived by data-mining algorithms, using a dataset collected from an experiment conducted at a research facility. To minimize the energy while maintaining the corresponding IAQ (indoor air quality) within a user-defined range, a multi-objective optimization model is developed. The solutions of this model are set points of the control system derived with an evolutionary computation algorithm. The controllable input variables - supply air temperature and supply <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> static <b>pressure</b> set points - are generated to reduce the energy use. The results produced by the evolutionary computation algorithm show that the control strategy saves energy by optimizing operations of an HVAC system. 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A new {{principle}} for radon protection is currently presented which {{makes use of}} a system of horizontal pressur-ised <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> located within {{the lower part of the}} rigid insulation layer of the ground-floor slab. The function of this sys-tem is based on the principles of pressure reduction within the zone below the ground-floor construction. For this purpose a new system of prefabricated lightweight elements is introduced. The effectiveness of the system is demonstrated for the case of a ground-floor reinforced concrete slab situated on top of a rigid insulation layer (consisting of a thermal insula-tion layer located on top of a capillary-breaking layer) mounted in turn on stable ground. The new system of prefabricated lightweight elements consists of the capillary-breaking layer and a pressure-reduction zone which is working as the radon-suction zone. The radon-suctioning layer is formed from a grid of horizontal <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> with low <b>pressure</b> which are able to remove air and radon from the ground. Results showed the system to be effective in preventing radon infiltrating from the ground through the ground-floor slab, avoiding high concentrations of radon being accumulated inside houses. For the system to be effective, the <b>pressure</b> within the <b>ducts</b> must be lower than the pressure inside the house. The new principle was shown to be effective in preventing radon from polluting the indoor air by introducing low pressure in the horizontal grid of <b>air</b> <b>ducts.</b> A lower <b>pressure</b> than the pressure inside the building must be established. The prefabricated lightweight elements were integrated into the insulation layer below the material of the ground-floor slab. The element and the insula-tion material were made of expanded polystyrene. The new element can be handled by one man on site...|$|R

40|$|The energy {{consumed}} by heating, ventilating, {{and air conditioning}} (HVAC) systems has increased {{in the past two}} decades. Thus, improving efficiency of HVAC systems has gained more and more attentions. This concern has posed challenges for modeling and optimizing HVAC systems. The traditional methods, such as analytical and statistical methods, are usually computationally complex and involve assumptions that may not hold in practice since HVAC system is a complex, nonlinear, and dynamic system. Data-mining approach is a novel science aiming at extracting system characteristics, identifying models and recognizing patterns from large-size data set. It has proved its power in modeling complex and nonlinear systems through various effective and successful applications in industrial, business, and medical areas. Classical data-mining techniques, such as neural networks and boosting tree have been largely applied into modeling HVAC systems in literature. Evolutionary computation, including swarm intelligence, have rapidly developed in the past decades and then applied to improving the performance of HVAC systems. This research focuses on modeling, optimizing, and controlling an HVAC system. Data-mining algorithms are first utilized to extract predictive models from experimental data set at Energy Resource Station in Ankeney. Evolutionary algorithms are then employed to solve the optimization models converted from the above data-driven models. In the optimization process, two set points of the HVAC system, supply <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> static <b>pressure</b> set point and supply air temperature set point, are controlled aiming at improving the energy efficiency and maintaining thermal comfort. The methodology presented in this research is applicable to various industrial processes other than HVAC systems...|$|R

Aim: This research aims to analysis the magnitude of electromagnetic wave radiation of high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> construction on health. Methods: The study was conducted by measuring electromagnetic wave radiation prior to high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> (150 kV) construction and predicting the amount of radiation generated after this operation and its impact on health. Result: The field measurement result showed that the highest strength of magnetic field in the absence of construction and operation activity of high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> 150 kV was 0. 00085 mT and the highest electric field was 0. 004241251 V/m.

The value was far lower than the standard limits recommended by IRPA / INIRC, WHO 1990 and SNI 04 - 6950 - 2003. The allowed electric field strength is 5 kV / m and the allowed magnetic field strength is 0. 1 mT.
