In many practical applications, pH-sensitive surfactants are added as a secondary surfactant because they enhance performance properties, including solubility, foaming, and mildness to the skin or to the eyes. In addition, pH-sensitive surfactants may be used effectively in novel applications where pH variations can be utilized to control self-assembly, including controlled drug release, targeted gene delivery, and the fabrication of nanoscale materials for optics, electronics, and sensors.

30|$|For {{deriving}} QSPR {{predictions of}} log Kow/D for surfactants, {{recommendations for the}} current most appropriate methods and approaches are provided in Table  6.

For anionics, there are fewer QSPR methods with good predictivity (including ALOGP) based on R 2 and MAE values. Cationic log Kow values were largely over-predicted, whereas amphoterics were often under-predicted by the various QSPR models used in this assessment. Whilst there are some QSPR methods available which can be applied for non-ionic and anionic surfactants, there is a dearth of methods for prediction of either cationic or <b>amphoteric</b> <b>surfactants.</b> Approaches are required to address this.

Glycine betaine is an amphoteric small compound, very polar that acts as osmoprotectant in plants and protective agent of the liver, of the heart and of the vessels in human. In order to exploit its numerous effects, researchers synthesized surfactant derivatives including alkylbetaines, alkylamidobetaines, betainates (esters of glycine betaine monomers, geminis and bolaforms) and betainamides (amides of glycine betaine). Alkylbetaines and alkylamidobetaines are produced on the industrial scale and are used as <b>amphoteric</b> <b>surfactants</b> in cosmetics. They are less irritating compared to sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS). Betainates and betainamides are produced on laboratory scale.
