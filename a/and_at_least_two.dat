5|$|Early in its duration, Hurricane Florence {{produced}} large swells {{that affected}} the East Coast of the United States. Rip currents caused three deaths due to drowning in North Carolina, {{all in the}} southern portion of the state. Seven other people needed rescue, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> beaches were closed. Florence contributed to a locally high number of rip current-related deaths in 2000; in response, the National Weather Service office in Wilmington implemented a new rip current warning system for the summer of 2001.|$|E

5|$|Finless {{porpoises}} have commonly {{been kept}} in Japan, {{as well as}} China and Indonesia. Ninety four in total have been in captivity in Japan, eleven in China, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> in Indonesia. Japan has had three establishments designated for breeding them, {{and there have been}} five recorded births. Three calves died moments after their birth, but two survived for several years. This breeding success proved that porpoises can be successfully bred in captivity, and this could open up new conservation options.|$|E
5|$|It took {{sixteen years}} from the initial {{developing}} stage begun in 1994, until the Greenville Bridge opened to traffic on August 4, 2010. The entire cost of the bridge totaled $336 million. In 2011, the massive process of removing the old bridge by cutting into small sections to be recycled was begun, {{and is expected to}} be completed by September 2012. At times, the river has been closed to traffic to aid the demolition. The job is dangerous <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> workers have died.|$|E

5|$|On the Potomac River, where tides ran {{well above}} normal, ships broke free from their {{moorings}} and drifted downstream. In one instance, a large steamship called the George Leary struck and damaged six other ships. Numerous vessels capsized in the river, including the steamer Mary Washington and the schooner John W. Linnell. At the Washington Navy Yard, multiple buildings sustained damage. Overall losses in Washington, D.C. were approximately $400,000, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> dozen {{individuals in the}} city suffered injuries from falling debris.|$|E
5|$|The new He 162 {{had about}} 30 minutes worth of fuel. This {{endurance}} {{was simply not}} enough, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> JG 1 pilots were killed making Deadstick landing after exhausting their fuel. By April, I./JG 1 had scored a number of kills, but {{at the cost of}} 13 He 162s and 10 pilots. The losses were mostly attributed to issues with the He 162 such as engine flame-outs or occasional structural failures, which can most probably be attributed to poor design and insufficient development time. On 24 April 1945, III./JG 1 was disbanded.|$|E
5|$|After {{the date}} of the writ of {{election}} <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> clear days before nomination day, a candidate or prospective candidate must provide the Registrar of Political Donations with a report stating all the donations received from permissible donors that amount to at least $10,000 received during the 12 months preceding the declaration mentioned in the next sentence. He must also submit to the Registrar a declaration stating, to the best of his knowledge and belief, that he did not receive any other donations required to be mentioned in the donation report, and that only donations from permissible donors or allowable anonymous donations were accepted. If this paperwork is in order, the Registrar will issue a political donation certificate not later than the eve of nomination day stating that the candidate has complied with the provisions of the Act.|$|E

5|$|Blue whales were {{abundant}} {{in nearly all}} the oceans on Earth {{until the beginning of}} the twentieth century. For over a century, they were hunted almost to extinction by whalers until protected by the international community in 1966. A 2002 report estimated there were 5,000 to 12,000 blue whales worldwide, in at least five groups. The IUCN estimates that there are probably between 10,000 and 25,000 blue whales worldwide today. Before whaling, the largest population was in the Antarctic, numbering approximately 239,000 (range 202,000 to 311,000). There remain only much smaller (around 2,000) concentrations in each of the eastern North Pacific, Antarctic, and Indian Ocean groups. There are two more groups in the North Atlantic, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> in the Southern Hemisphere. As of 2014, the Eastern North Pacific blue whale population had rebounded to nearly its pre-hunting population.|$|E
5|$|Ninth Army {{eventually}} evacuated {{the salient}} in Operation Buffalo (Büffel) in March 1943, {{as part of}} a general shortening of the line. Large-scale anti-partisan sweeps were carried out in the weeks before the operation (the army's sector was a hotbed for partisan activity), in which an estimated 3,000 Russians were killed, the great majority of whom were unarmed, as shown by the inventory of the seized weapons: 277 rifles, 41 pistols, 61 machine guns, 17 mortars, 9 antitank rifles and 16 small artillery pieces. The withdrawal itself took two weeks, with minimal casualties or disruption in a move of an Army group numbering approximately 300,000 men, 100 tanks and 400 artillery pieces. In its wake, Model personally ordered the deportation of all male civilians, wells poisoned, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> dozen villages razed in a scorched earth policy to hinder the Red Army's follow up in the area.|$|E
5|$|There was no {{need for}} the Mint to produce any pennies in 1933 because they was no {{commercial}} demand, and it possessed ample stocks from prior years in storage. There was a custom at that time for the King to place a set of coins of the current year under the foundation stone of important new buildings, and the Mint struck three 1933 pennies for this purpose, also one each for its own museum and for the British Museum, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> others. The result was a rarity that people thought might turn up in their pocket change, and that is probably the best-known British rare coin.|$|E

5|$|Water clocks, or Fenjaan, in Persia {{reached a}} level of {{accuracy}} comparable to today's standards of timekeeping. The fenjaan was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for calculating the amount or the time that a farmer must take water from a qanat or well for irrigation of the farms, until it was replaced by more accurate current clock. Persian water clocks were a practical and useful tool for the qanat's shareholders to calculate {{the length of time}} they could divert water to their farm. The qanat was the only water source for agriculture and irrigation so a just and fair water distribution was very important. Therefore, a very fair and clever old person was elected to be the manager of the water clock, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> full-time managers were needed to control and observe the number of fenjaans and announce the exact time during the days and nights.|$|E
5|$|Arkwright's {{innovations}} {{were not}} confined to developing workers' settlements; he also had patents on many technologies used for water-powered spinning. They were so successful that rival industrialists risked legal action by copying his designs. His patents expired in 1785, and by 1788 over 200Arkwright type mills had been founded in Britain. New Lanark in Scotland– also a World Heritage Site– was directly influenced by Richard Arkwright and the developments in the Derwent Valley; Lanark {{was identified as a}} potential site for a mill on a visit by David Dale and Arkwright in 1784. Dale later established four mills at Lanark; they were structurally similar to Arkwright's Masson Mill <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> of the mills used technology developed in the Derwent Valley, although the factory system was different from that used in the Derwent Valley. New Lanark was acquired by Robert Owen in 1799 who developed paternalism further than had been done in the Derwent Valley, experimenting with education for young and old and social control. Saltaire– another World Heritage Site– was founded in 1853 and featured worker's housing and facilities, as well as other elements of the factory system developed by Arkwright.|$|E
5|$|In 118 BC, King Micipsa of Numidia (current-day Algeria and Tunisia) died. He was {{succeeded by}} two {{legitimate}} sons, Adherbal and Hiempsal, and an illegitimate son, Jugurtha. Micipsa divided his kingdom between these three sons. Jugurtha, however, {{turned on his}} brothers, killing Hiempsal and driving Adherbal out of Numidia. Adherbal fled to Rome for assistance, and initially Rome mediated {{a division of the}} country between the two brothers. Eventually, Jugurtha renewed his offensive, leading to a long and inconclusive war with Rome. He also bribed several Roman commanders, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> tribunes, before and during the war. His nemesis, Gaius Marius, a legate from a virtually unknown provincial family, returned from the war in Numidia and was elected consul in 107 BC over the objections of the aristocratic senators. Marius invaded Numidia and brought the war to a quick end, capturing Jugurtha in the process. The apparent incompetence of the Senate, and the brilliance of Marius, had been put on full display. The populares party took full advantage of this opportunity by allying itself with Marius.|$|E

5|$|In France, the {{regiment}} regained battalion strength {{in preparation for}} the Battle of the Somme. The regiment, still with the 29th British Division, went into the line in April 1916 at Beaumont-Hamel. Beaumont-Hamel was situated near the northern end of the 45-kilometre front being assaulted by the joint French and British force. The attack, originally scheduled for 29 June 1916 was postponed by two days to July 1, 1916, partly on account of inclement weather, partly to allow more time for the artillery preparation. The 29th British Division, with its three infantry brigades faced defences manned by experienced troops of the 119th (Reserve) Infantry Regiment of the 26th (Wurttemberg) Reserve Division. The 119th (Reserve) Infantry Regiment had been involved in the invasion of France in August 1914 and had been manning the Beaumont-Hamel section of the line for nearly 20 months prior to the battle. The German troops were spending a great deal of their time not only training but fortifying their position, including the construction of numerous deep dugouts <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> tunnels.|$|E
5|$|Joyce {{enrolled}} at the recently established University College Dublin (UCD) in 1898, studying English, French and Italian. He became active in theatrical and literary circles in the city. In 1900 his laudatory review of Henrik Ibsen's When We Dead Awaken was published in The Fortnightly Review; {{it was his first}} publication and, after learning basic Norwegian to send a fan letter to Ibsen, he received a letter of thanks from the dramatist. Joyce wrote a number of other articles <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> plays (since lost) during this period. Many of the friends he made at University College Dublin appeared as characters in Joyce's works. His closest colleagues included leading figures of the generation, most notably, Tom Kettle, Francis Sheehy-Skeffington and Oliver St. John Gogarty. Joyce was first introduced to the Irish public by Arthur Griffith in his newspaper, United Irishman, in November 1901. Joyce had written an article on the Irish Literary Theatre and his college magazine refused to print it. Joyce had it printed and distributed locally. Griffith himself wrote a piece decrying the censorship of the student James Joyce. In 1901, the National Census of Ireland lists James Joyce (19) as an English- and Irish-speaking scholar living with his mother and father, six sisters and three brothers at Royal Terrace (now Inverness Road), Clontarf, Dublin.|$|E
5|$|Several emu {{specimens}} {{belonging to}} the different subspecies were sent to France, both live and dead, {{as part of the}} expedition. Some of these exist in European museums today. Le Naturaliste brought one live specimen and one skin of the mainland emu to France in June 1803. Le Géographe collected emus from both King and Kangaroo Island, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> live King Island individuals, assumed to be a male and female by some sources, were taken to France in March 1804. This ship also brought skins of five juveniles collected from different islands. Two of these skins, of which the provenance is unknown, are presently kept in Paris and Turin; the rest are lost. In addition to rats, cockroaches, and other inconveniences aboard the ships, the emus were incommoded by the rough weather which caused the ships to shake violently; some died as a result, while others had to be force fed so they did not starve to death. In all, Le Géographe brought 73 live animals of various species back to France.|$|E
