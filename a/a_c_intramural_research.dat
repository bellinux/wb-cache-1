40|$|Nanotechnology is the {{manipulation}} of matter on a near-atomic scale to produce new structures, materials, and devices. This technology {{has the ability to}} transform many industries and will have numerous applications to areas ranging from medicine to manufacturing. Research in nanoscale technologies is growing rapidly worldwide. By 2015, the National Science Foundation estimates that nanotechnology will have a $ 1 trillion impact on the global economy and employ 2 million workers, 1 million of which may be in the United States. Nanomaterials may present new challenges to understanding, predicting, and managing potential health risks to workers. Many knowledge gaps remain to be filled before we fully understand how to work safely with these materials. Through strategic planning, research, partnering with others, and making information widely available, NIOSH is working in parallel with {{the development and implementation of}} nanotechnology to provide national and world leadership in preventing work-related illness and injury.

50|$|The NIH's {{research}} {{is divided into}} two parts: the Extramural Research Program is responsible for the funding of biomedical research outside the NIH, while the <b>Intramural</b> <b>Research</b> Program (IRP) is the internal research program of the NIH, known for its synergistic approach to biomedical science. <b>Intramural</b> <b>research</b> is primarily conducted at the main campus in Bethesda, Maryland, immediately adjacent to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and right outside Washington, D.C.. The NIH campus houses the divisions of <b>intramural</b> <b>research</b> for eighteen of the twenty national institutes, including the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the National Cancer Institute, and the National Institute of Mental Health, as well as the National Library of Medicine, while the adjoining Walter Reed campus houses the military medical center, the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute, the National Intrepid Center of Excellence, and the Joint Pathology Center.|$|R
