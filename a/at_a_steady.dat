After the fire, it experienced a long period of decline and only had 10,000 inhabitants in 1836. However, the population started to rise again after 1850 and reached 32,000 inhabitants in 1905.

5|$|Space Station Silicon Valley is a {{platform}} game that is viewed from a third-person perspective. Players traverse several different environments to advance through the game. During the game, players control Evo—a robot who {{is reduced to}} a crawling microchip during a ship crash, and is losing energy <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> rate without protection. In order to survive, players attack animals, which disables them and allows players to assume control of their bodies. Each animal possesses different characteristics, including survival rate and special attacks, and uses different abilities; for example, large animals such as bears are able to destroy ice blocks, which other animals are incapable of doing so. Some animals are also unable to survive in certain unfamiliar environments, forcing players to enter the body of another. The animals are used to solve puzzles and defeat enemies in each level, collecting Evo's power cells to maintain energy.|$|E

He ordered a withdrawal and the Romans moved back <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> pace, during which they were subjected to a concentrated shower of arrows by the Muslims. This was the last attempt by Thomas to break the siege. The attempt had failed. He had lost thousands of men in these sallies, and could no longer afford to fight outside the walls of the city.|$|E
5|$|The third {{storm of}} the season was first {{identified}} as tropical depression off the northwestern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula early on September 6. The system moved <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> pace to the northwest towards the Rio Grande Valley. Shortly after forming, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm. At this time, a ship {{in the vicinity of}} the storm recorded a pressure of 1012 mbar (hPa). By 1800 UTC that day, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). Around 9 pm CST (0300 UTC on September 7) that night, storm warnings were issued for areas between Brownsville and Corpus Christi, Texas. These warnings were later expanded to include the entire Texas coastline.|$|E

Today, due to the pre-allocation of catch that accompanies IFQs, the season lasts nearly eight months and boats deliver fresh fish <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>steadier</b> pace. However, halibut stocks have been in continuous decline for over a decade, as poor stock assessments leading to overfishing have caused a substantial decline in biomass.Additionally, despite the increase in landings value, the number of quota holders has declined by 44%, as consolidation and quota pricing has served to prevent new entrants.|$|R

She stated to the reporters that she wanted to meet Timoleon Philimon (the General-Secretary of the Hellenic Olympic Committee) to present her case. Historians believe that she intended to present her documents to the Hellenic Olympic Committee in the hopes that they would recognize her achievement. Neither her reports nor documents from the Hellenic Olympic Committee have been discovered to provide corroboration.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Guillermo {{began its}} {{extensive}} track as a tropical wave that moved {{off the coast}} of Africa on July16, 1997. Initially disorganized and weak, the system tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean for several weeks. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) stated that they had issues monitoring the system as it moved through the Caribbean; however, they interpreted through satellite data that the wave crossed Central America and entered the Pacific Ocean between July27 and 28. Once in the Pacific, convection, areas of thunderstorm activity, and banding features began to form. Additionally, a low pressure system developed within the disturbance by July29. The following day, the system became sufficiently organized for the NHC to classify it as Tropical Depression Nine-E; at this time the depression was situated roughly 345mi (555km) south of Salina Cruz, Mexico. In response to a deep-layer ridge to the north, the depression tracked <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> pace towards the west-northwest, and this motion persisted through the first week of August. Within a day of being classified, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Guillermo, the seventh named storm of the 1997 season.|$|E
5|$|In 1294, Wales {{broke out}} in {{rebellion}} led by Madog ap Llywelyn, prince of Wales. As Caernarfon was the centre of administration in Gwynedd and a symbol of English power, it was targeted by the Welsh. Madog's forces captured the town in September, {{and in the process}} heavily damaged the town walls. The castle was defended by just a ditch and a temporary barricade. It was quickly taken and anything flammable was set alight. Fire raged across Caernarfon, leaving destruction in its wake. In the summer of 1295, the English moved to retake Caernarfon. By November the same year, the English began refortifying the town. Rebuilding the town walls was a high priority, and £1,195 (nearly half the sum initially spent on the walls) was spent on completing the job two months ahead of schedule. Attention then shifted to the castle and on finishing the work that had halted in 1292. Once the rebellion was put down, Edward began building Beaumaris Castle on the Isle of Anglesey. The work was overseen by James of Saint George; as a result, Walter of Hereford took over as master mason for the new phase of construction. By the end of 1301, a further £4,500 had been spent on the work with the focus of work on the northern wall and towers. The accounts between November 1301 and September 1304 are missing, possibly because there was a hiatus in work while labour moved north to help out with England's war against Scotland. Records show that Walter of Hereford had left Caernarfon and was in Carlisle in October 1300; he remained occupied with the Scottish wars until the autumn of 1304 when building at Caernarfon resumed. Walter died in 1309 and his immediate subordinate, Henry of Ellerton, took over the position of master mason. Construction continued <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> rate until 1330.|$|E

Though not as fast as jackals and foxes, they can chase their prey for many hours. During a pursuit, one or more dholes may take over chasing their prey, while the rest of the pack keeps up <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>steadier</b> pace behind, taking over once the other group tires.
