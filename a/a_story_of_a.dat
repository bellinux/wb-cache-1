5|$|Between 1841 and 1846, he {{published}} Beniowski, {{considered by some}} his best lyrical poetry. Starting as <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> historical figure, it developed into {{a discussion of the}} poet's own life and opinions. In 1842 he joined the religious-philosophical group, Koło Sprawy Bożej (Circle of God's Cause), led by Andrzej Towiański. This group included, among others, Mickiewicz. Towiański's influence is credited with a new, mystical current in Słowacki's works, seen in works such as the poem Beniowski and the drama Ksiądz Marek (Father Mark). Słowacki left the Circle a year later, in 1843.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{suffered}} {{a series of}} minor strokes in the late 1960s, which {{marked the beginning of}} a slow decline in his health. Despite the setbacks, he was soon writing a new film script, The Freak, <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> winged girl found in South America, which he intended as a starring vehicle for his daughter, Victoria. His fragile health prevented the project from being realised. In the early 1970s, Chaplin concentrated on re-releasing his old films, including The Kid and The Circus. In 1971, he was made a Commander of the National Order of the Legion of Honour at the Cannes Film Festival. The following year, he was honoured with a special award by the Venice Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|Giovanni Verga's 1871 novel Storia di una capinera, {{according}} to its author, was inspired by <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> blackcap trapped and caged by children. The bird, silent and pining for its lost freedom, eventually dies. In the book, a nun evacuated from her convent by cholera {{falls in love with}} a family friend, only to have to return to her confinement when the disease wanes. The novel was adapted as films of the same name in 1917, 1943 and 1993. The last version was directed by Franco Zeffirelli, and its English-language version was retitled as Sparrow. In Saint François d'Assise, an opera by Messiaen, the orchestration is based on bird song. St Francis himself is represented by the blackcap.|$|E

5|$|The turn of {{the decade}} brought Scorsese's {{black-and-white}} Raging Bull (cowritten by Schrader); an acknowledged masterpiece—the American Film Institute ranks it as the greatest American film of the 1980s and the fourth greatest of all time—it is also a retreat, telling <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> boxer's moral self-destruction that recalls in both theme and visual ambience noir dramas such as Body and Soul (1947) and Champion (1949). From 1981, the popular Body Heat, {{written and directed by}} Lawrence Kasdan, invokes a different set of classic noir elements, this time in a humid, erotically charged Florida setting; its success confirmed the commercial viability of neo-noir, {{at a time when the}} major Hollywood studios were becoming increasingly risk averse. The mainstreaming of neo-noir is evident in such films as Black Widow (1987), Shattered (1991), and Final Analysis (1992). Few neo-noirs have made more money or more wittily updated the tradition of the noir double-entendre than Basic Instinct (1992), directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Joe Eszterhas. The film also demonstrates how neo-noir's polychrome palette can reproduce many of the expressionistic effects of classic black-and-white noir. Poison Ivy (1992) makes use of similar devices executed in Basic Instinct, including a shady, seductive femme-fatale with ulterior motives.|$|E

25|$|Spong's {{conclusion}} is that early Bible authors, after the First Jewish-Roman War, sought {{to distance themselves from}} Rome's enemies.
