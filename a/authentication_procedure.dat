5000|$|Identity {{assurance}} specifically {{refers to}} the degree of certainty of an identity assertion made by an identity provider by presenting an identity credential to the Relying Party. In order to issue this assertion, the Identity Provider must first determine whether or not the claimant possesses and controls an appropriate token, using a predefined authentication protocol.

5000|$|One {{familiar}} use of authentication and authorization is access control. A {{computer system}} {{that is supposed to}} be used only by those authorized must attempt to detect and exclude the unauthorized. Access to it is therefore usually controlled by insisting on an <b>authentication</b> <b>procedure</b> to establish with some degree of confidence the identity of the user, granting privileges established for that identity. One such procedure involves the usage of Layer 8 which allows IT administrators to identify users, control Internet activity of users in the network, set user based policies and generate reports by username.

In addition, the elements selected must be mutually independent, i.e. the breach of one does not compromise the other(s). At least one of the elements should be non-reusable and non-replicable (except for inherence), and not capable of being surreptitiously stolen via the Internet.

5000|$|Technically, DRI3 {{consists}} of two different extensions, the [...] "DRI3" [...] extension and the [...] "Present" [...] extension. The main purpose of the DRI3 extension is to implement the mechanism to share direct rendered buffers between DRI clients and the X Server. DRI clients allocate and use GEM buffers objects as rendering targets, while the X Server represents these render buffers using a type of X11 object called [...] "pixmap". DRI3 provides two operations, [...] and , one to create a pixmap (in [...] "X Server space") from a GEM buffer object (in [...] "DRI client space"), {{and the other to}} do the reverse and get a GEM buffer object from an X pixmap. In these DRI3 operations GEM buffer objects are passed as DMA-BUF file descriptors instead of GEM names. DRI3 also provides a way to share synchronization objects between the DRI client and the X Server, allowing both a serialized access to the shared buffer. Unlike DRI2, the initial [...] operation [...] - the first every DRI client must request to know which DRM device to use - [...] returns an already open file descriptor to the device node instead of the device node filename, with any required <b>authentication</b> <b>procedure</b> already performed in advance by the X Server.|$|E

Typically, a user is challenged to provide a token that they know {{to prove that they}} are authorised. In the case that this token (password, passphrase, personal identification number, etc.) is forgotten, the usual approach has been to provide password hints or password reset questions during credential recovery to help ensure a user is who they claim to be before allowing them to reset the token. Survey++ is a platform designed to test the usability and security of credential recovery mechanisms. Survey++ was built to test a credential recovery mechanism that reminds a user of their password by showing them characters from the password, but it can be easily extended to test other recovery mechanisms or <b>authentication</b> <b>procedures.</b> Copyright 2014 Vincent Taylor and Ivan Flechais...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{goal of the}} third-generation mobile {{systems is}} to provide {{worldwide}} operation, enhance service capabilities, and improve performance over the second-generation mobile systems. In this paper, we propose an <b>authentication</b> <b>procedure</b> for third-generation mobile systems. The <b>authentication</b> <b>procedure</b> is a protocol suite consisting of two subprotocols: a certificate-based authentication (CBA) protocol and a ticket-based authentica-tion (TBA) protocol. Only two parties, MS and VLR, are involved in executing our protocol. Our <b>authentication</b> <b>procedure</b> uses both public- and secret-key cryptosystems. Our <b>authentication</b> <b>procedure</b> not only provides uniform authentication across domains, but also reduces computational costs {{in the process of}} repeated authentication. We provide firm proof of our procedure’s correctness...|$|E

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) within {{the third generation}} (3 G) networks materializes {{the next generation of}} mobile/wireless systems, named 3 G-WLANs integrated networks. This paper proposes an improved <b>authentication</b> <b>procedure</b> for the 3 G-WLANs integrated networks that enables a WLAN user to get access to the 3 G packet switched services or to the public Internet through the 3 G public land mobile network. The proposed procedure reduces significantly the authentication overhead compared to the legacy one, without compromising the provided security services. A security analysis of the proposed <b>authentication</b> <b>procedure</b> is elaborated that ensures the correctness of the <b>authentication</b> <b>procedure,</b> the provision of advanced security services and the elimination of possible attacks that may threaten the proposed <b>authentication</b> <b>procedure.</b> In addition, an energy cost analysis is carried out that compares the energy consumption induced by the legacy and the proposed authentication procedures. Finally, a communication cost analysis is provided that estimates the cost improvement of the proposed over the legacy <b>authentication</b> <b>procedure.</b> Keywords: 3 G-WLANs, EAP-AKA, authentication, security. ...|$|E

30|$|From the <b>authentication</b> <b>procedures</b> above, {{it can be}} {{seen that}} USIM just realizes a {{specific}} authentication algorithm AKA which is independent of the underlying communication technologies. That is, regardless of what kind of access networks, USIM always implements this algorithm to realize the mutual authentication with the mobile core networks.

The defense against Web spoofing attacks is a challenging problem since most users are unwilling (or unable) to follow complex interactive <b>authentication</b> <b>procedures</b> (e. g., inspect a Web server certificate).

30|$|IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) {{introduces}} important {{advantages for}} users of LTE-femtocell heterogeneous access networks. In order to access services hosted in the IMS layer, the user has to undergo <b>authentication</b> <b>procedure</b> with the access network, {{followed by an}} <b>authentication</b> <b>procedure</b> with the IMS layer. This multi-pass <b>authentication</b> <b>procedure</b> is essential for securing IMS from malicious users, resulting in added overhead and possible quality of service degradations. The problem is further compounded when the user moves from one femtocell domain into another, which requires the <b>authentication</b> <b>procedure</b> to be repeated. To mitigate this problem, we present a lightweight, robust, and architecture-compatible IMS authentication protocol that implements a one-pass IMS procedure by promoting efficient key re-use for a mobile user. We make use of Home Node B femtocells to perform the role of IMS proxy. To verify the feasibility of using our protocol in mobile networks, an abstract model of our protocol is derived. The abstract model is emulated using Asterisk server and virtualization techniques. We also analyze the authentication delay of our proposed scheme. Numerical results reveal a reduction in user authentication delay of more than 50 percent compared to the existing <b>authentication</b> <b>procedure.</b>|$|E
