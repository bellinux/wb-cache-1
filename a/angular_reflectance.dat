40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide a deeper understanding of the physics of satellite remote-sensing when off-nadir observations are considered. Emphasis is placed on the analysis and modeling of atmospheric effects and the radiative transfer of non-Lambertian surface reflectance characteristics from ground-level to satellite locations. The relative importance of spectral, spatial, angular, and temporal reflectance characteristics for satellite-sensed identification of vegetation types in the visible and near-infrared wavelength regions is evaluated. The highest identification value is attributed to <b>angular</b> <b>reflectance</b> signatures. Using radiative transfer calculations to evaluate the atmospheric effects on <b>angular</b> <b>reflectance</b> distributions of vegetation surfaces, atmosphere-invariant <b>angular</b> <b>reflectance</b> features such as the 'hot spot' and the 'persistent valley' are identified. A new atmospheric correction formalism for complete <b>angular</b> <b>reflectance</b> distributions is described. A sample calculation demonstrates that a highly non-Lambertian measured surface reflectance distribution can be retrieved from simulated satellite data in the visible and near infrared to within about 20 percent accuracy for almost all view directions up to 60 deg off-nadir. Thus the high value of angular surface reflectance characteristics (the 'angular signature') for satellite-sensed feature identification is confirmed, which provides a scientific basis for future off-nadir satellite observations...|$|E
40|$|International audienceReflectance Transformation Imaging is {{a recent}} {{technique}} allowing for the measurement and the modeling {{of one of the}} most influential parameters on the appearance of a surface, namely the <b>angular</b> <b>reflectance,</b> thanks to the change in the direction of the lighting during acquisition. From these photometric stereo images (discrete data), the <b>angular</b> <b>reflectance</b> is modeled to allow both interactive and continuous relighting of the inspected surface. Two families of functions, based on polynomials and on hemispherical harmonics, are cited and used in the literature at this aim, respectively, associated to the PTM and HSH techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Discrete Modal Decomposition (DMD) based on a particular and appropriate Eigen basis derived from a structural dynamic problem. The performance of the proposed method is compared with the PTM and HSH results on three real surfaces showing different reflection behaviors. Comparisons are made in terms of both visual rendering and of statistical error (local and global). The obtained results show that the DMD is more efficient in that it allows for a more accurate modeling of the <b>angular</b> <b>reflectance</b> when light-matter interaction is complex such as the presence of shadows, specularities and inter-reflections...|$|E

This work was performed to allow accurate radiative transfer calculations over the region. Detailed tables and interpolation equations are given that permit other investigators to perform satellite calibrations over the alkali flats site. The effects of wavelength and soil moisture on narrowband <b>angular</b> <b>reflectance</b> are also investigated. Although there is a spectral variation in surface albedo, there is little spectral effect in Anisotropic Factor except in the forward scattering peak at solar zenith angles greater than 60 deg. The magnitude of the forward-scattering peak is also sensitive to soil moisture, with wet conditions causing a larger peak. The significance of this result is that <b>angular</b> <b>reflectance</b> properties {{at the center of}} the alkali flats usually will be different than those at the flats edge because moisture differences typically exist...|$|E

40|$|When {{the shape}} of an object is known, its {{appearance}} is determined by the spatially-varying reflectance function defined on its surface. Image-based rendering methods that use geometry seek to estimate this function from image data. Most existing methods recover a unique <b>angular</b> <b>reflectance</b> function (e. g., BRDF) at each surface point and provide reflectance estimates with high spatial resolution. Their angular accuracy is limited by the number of available images, and as a result, most of these methods focus on capturing parametric or low-frequency <b>angular</b> <b>reflectance</b> effects, or allowing only one of lighting or viewpoint variation. We present an alternative approach that enables an increase in the angular accuracy of a spatially-varying reflectance function in exchange for a decrease in spatial resolution. By framing the problem as scattered-data interpolation in a mixed spatial and angular domain, reflectance information is shared across the surface, exploiting the high spatial resolution that images provide to fill the holes between sparsely observed view and lighting directions. Since the BRDF typically varies slowly from point to point over much of an object’s surface, this method enables image-based rendering from a sparse set of images without assuming a parametric reflectance model. In fact, the method can even be applied in the limiting case of a single input image...|$|E

40|$|Regional {{analyses}} of biogeochemical processes can benefit significantly from observational information on land cover, vegetation structure (e. g., leaf area index), and biophysical properties such as fractional PAR absorption. Few remote sensing efforts {{have provided a}} suite of plant attributes needed to link vegetation structure to ecosystem function at high spatial resolution. In arid and semiarid ecosystems (e. g., savannas), high spatial heterogeneity of land cover results in significant functional interaction between dominant vegetation types, requiring new approaches to resolve their structural characteristics for regional-scale biogeochemical research. We developed and tested a satellite data fusion and radiative transfer inverse modeling approach to deliver estimates of vegetation structure in a savanna region of Texas. Spectral mixture analysis of Landsat data provided verifiable estimates of woody plant, herbaceous, bare soil, and shade fractions at 28. 5 m resolution. Using these subpixel cover fractions, a geometric-optical model was inverted to estimate overstory stand density and crown dimensions with reasonable accuracy. The Landsat cover estimates were then used to spectrally unmix the contribution of woody plant and herbaceous canopies to AVHRR multiangle <b>reflectance</b> data. These <b>angular</b> <b>reflectances</b> were used with radiative transfer model inversions to estimate canopy leaf area index (LAI). The suite of estimated canopy and landscape variables indicated distinct patterns in land cover and structural attributes related to land use. These variables were used to calculate diurnal PAR absorption and carbon uptake by woody and herbaceous canopies in contrasting land cover and land use types. We found that both LAI and the spatial distribution of vegetation structural types exert strong control on carbon fluxes and that intercanopy shading {{is an important factor}} controlling functional processes in spatially heterogeneous environments...|$|R

40|$|Figure 1 : We {{introduce}} a reflectance display: a dynamic digital array of dots, {{each of which}} can independently display a custom, time-varying reflectance function. The display passively reacts to illumination and viewpoint changes in real-time, without any illumination-recording sensors, head tracking, or on-the-fly rendering. In this example the time-varying reflectance functions create a “reflectance video” that gives {{the illusion of a}} dynamic 3 D model being physically-shaded by the room’s ambient lighting. The top row shows a time-sequence of photographs of the dynamic display from a stationary viewpoint under fixed ambient lighting, and the bottom row shows how the display reacts to changes in ambient lighting by passively inducing the appropriate 3 D shading effects. We present a reflectance display: a dynamic digital display capable of showing images and videos with spatially-varying, user-defined reflectance functions. Our display is passive: it operates by phase-modulation of reflected light. As such, it does not rely on any illu-mination recording sensors, nor does it require expensive on-the-fly rendering. It reacts to lighting changes instantaneouasly and con-sumes only a minimal amount of energy. Our work builds on the wave optics approach to BRDF fabrication of Levin et al. [2013]. We replace their expensive one-time hardware fabrication with a programable liquid crystal spatial light modulator, retaining high resolution of approximately 160 dpi. Our approach enables the display of a much wider family of <b>angular</b> <b>reflectances,</b> and it al-lows the display of dynamic content with time varying reflectance properties—“reflectance videos”.

40|$|Construction and {{building}} materials are generally considered Lambertian, namely they reflect as perfectly diffusive the radiation incident onto their surface. Thus, reflectance and absorptance {{are assumed to}} be constant and independent on the incidence and view angles. This assumption is not valid for specular materials, like glass or polished surfaces, where an angular dependence of their optical-radiative properties is observed. However, many opaque construction materials often show a mixed behaviour, which includes specular and diffuse (or scattering) reflectance components. Moreover, the apparent roughness of the materials surface changes according to the angle of incidence of the solar radiation. This issue is relevant for some cool materials, which are polished or treated with other methods to offer a very smooth surface, to increase the solar <b>reflectance.</b> Herein, the <b>angular</b> dependent solar <b>reflectance</b> of the opaque materials and the impact on the solar gains and energy balance of the building envelope is investigated. The off-normal solar spectral reflectance of four typical construction material for roofing and façade systems is measured with a spectrophotometer, equipped with a large integrating sphere, and with a goniophotometer to characterise the directional reflectance. The comparison between reflectance values in the visible band obtained with both devices shows relative variations lower than 2 % for materials with prevalent diffusing behaviour. Discrepancies up to 6 % are observed for the samples with a perceivable specular component. Solar <b>reflectance</b> <b>angular</b> dependent curves are calculated, starting from measurements, to compare different models to compute the solar gains.

We also investigated in detail the <b>angular</b> dependence of <b>reflectance</b> as well as haze factor of thin ITO coatings. Our results suggest that 10 nm thick ITO coating exhibits an average haze factor of 8. 6 %. The high value of IR emittance, moderate sheet resistance and high solar transmittance along with low haze factor indicate the suitability of ITO thin films on FEP substrates as flexible optical solar reflector for space applications...|$|R
