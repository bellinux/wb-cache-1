5|$|Candidates for Freemasonry {{will have}} met most active {{members of the}} Lodge they <b>are</b> <b>joining</b> before they are initiated. The process varies between jurisdictions, but the {{candidate}} will typically have been introduced by a friend at a Lodge social function, or at some form of open evening in the Lodge. In modern times, interested people often track down a local Lodge through the Internet. The onus is on candidates to ask to join; while candidates may be encouraged to ask, they are never invited. Once the initial inquiry is made, an interview usually follows to determine the candidate's suitability. If the candidate decides to proceed from here, the Lodge ballots on the application before he (or she, depending on the Masonic Jurisdiction) can be accepted.|$|E

Elsewhere, the devastated Kapp is left alone in the ruins of his cottage and observatory. More and more young people <b>are</b> <b>joining</b> the Planet People, {{including}} the gangs that have been terrorising the cities and the soldiers assigned to keep them away from the Megalithic sites. Contact is restored with Chuck Marshall and with the Russians in the form of Gurov (Brewster Mason). Quatermass theorises {{that this is not the}} first time this has happened; megalithic sites such as prehistoric stone circles are in fact markers where beacons have been left by the alien force for its next visit. Quatermass believes the force is a sphere of energy surrounding the Earth. The Russians and the Americans send a space shuttle, commanded by Marshall, to make contact with the force. Quatermass is sceptical; he believes they are dealing not with an intelligence but with a machine constructed to harvest human protein. The space shuttle is destroyed but not before Marshall reports a giant beam of light stretching in all directions. Meanwhile, the Planet People are gathering at Wembley Stadium in the tens of thousands. Annie and Quatermass travel to the stadium but are powerless to prevent the Planet People from gathering. When they are attacked, Annie drives their car into the underground car park beneath the stadium where she crashes the vehicle and is killed. The lightning strikes the stadium.|$|E

25|$|On June 19, 2017, famous poker player, {{businessman}} and European Parliament member Antanas Guoga bought major stake {{of the club}} (2/4) from Sigitas Židonis and Remigijus Kazilionis. Two remaining stake owners Darius Gudelis and Vilnius City Municipality retained their rights to the club (1/4 each). On June 20, 2017, Gedvydas Vainauskas resigned from the Rytas president post following 20 years of operation since {{the founding of the}} club in 1997 just a week after receiving award from LKL president Remigijus Milašius for merits to basketball. Shortly after becoming new owner of the club, Guoga sparked discussions about changing the club's name and invited the public to offer their ideas since the team no longer have connections with the Vainauskas' newspaper Lietuvos rytas. The idea was strictly criticised by the club's elite fans group B Tribūna (Rytas Ultras), who told that the only team they will support is black-white-red Rytas. On June 21, 2017, the new owners organized a meeting, during which first changes were made: public institution Krepšinio rytas was renamed to Statyba in order to remember the historical BC Statyba, Darius Gudelis replaced Martynas Purlys in the club's director position and it was decided that the club's name Lietuvos rytas will be changed in not longer than 1-year term with the most likely but not yet final choice being Rytas. Guoga also told media that it is very likely that at least two Lithuanian basketball stars will participate in the team activities, bearing in mind Jonas Valančiūnas, Linas Kleiza and Arvydas Macijauskas. On July 4, 2017, Gudelis announced that former assistant coach Alberto Blanco and Linas Kleiza <b>are</b> <b>joining</b> the club, whose first task will be assisting Rimas Kurtinaitis to bring together new roster of the team. On July 13, 2017, press conference was held during which it was announced that Kleiza also became shareholder of the club by receiving part of the Guoga's stake, was named vice-president of the club and will also act as sports director. Limited liability company Norvelita and Perlas also became shareholders of the club.|$|E
500|$|Influenced by {{the social}} and geopolitical {{situation}} of the early 1970s and the hippie youth movement of the late 1960s, Quatermass {{is set in a}} near future in which large numbers of young people <b>are</b> <b>joining</b> a cult, the [...] "Planet People", and gathering at prehistoric sites, believing they will be transported to a better life on another planet. The series begins with Professor Quatermass arriving in London to look for his granddaughter, Hettie Carlson, and witnessing the destruction of two spacecraft and the disappearance of a group of Planet People at a stone circle by an unknown force. He investigates this force, believing that Hettie may be in danger. As the series progresses, it becomes apparent that the Planet People are being harvested rather than transported.|$|E

[...] "Eddyism" [...] was viewed as a cult; one of the first uses of the modern sense of the word was in A. H. Barrington's Anti-Christian Cults (1898), a book about Spiritualism, Theosophy and Christian Science. In a few cases Christian Scientists were expelled from Christian congregations, but ministers also worried that their parishioners were choosing to leave. In May 1885 the London Times Boston correspondent wrote about the [...] "Boston mind-cure craze": [...] "Scores of the most valued Church members <b>are</b> <b>joining</b> the Christian Scientist branch of the metaphysical organization, and it has thus far been impossible to check the defection."

Tamim Nuristani, former governor of Nuristan, {{believed that}} numerous Taliban and Pakistani militant and terrorist groups banded together from surrounding regions including Kunar and the Bajaur tribal agency in neighboring Pakistan. According to U.S. intelligence groups operating in the region included Taliban, al-Qaeda, Kashmir-based Lashkar-e-Taiba and Pakistan-based (as of 2013 still located in 1 of many strongholds in the Bajaur agency of F.A.T.A.-Federally administered Tribal areas in Kunar and Nuristan of Afghanistan) Hezb-i-Islami. According to the Long War Journal, Al Qaeda's senior leadership including Ayman al Zawahiri and Osama Bin Laden were thought to shelter in the region (Bin Laden was then in Pakistan). Taliban spokesman stated [...] "The fighting in Afghanistan is getting heavier. When the Americans drop bombs on civilians, ordinary people want revenge – that's why they <b>are</b> <b>joining</b> the Taliban, strengthening us" [...] pointing out their [...] "ability to enter the bases and kill Americans." [...] A NATO spokesman believed that the Taliban had moved into and expelled a nearby Khel (small village-tribe subdivision) for the attack. On the evening of July 12, Taliban soldiers moved into Wanat and ordered the villagers to leave. Undetected by the I.S.A.F./A.N.S.F. soldiers, they set up firing positions inside Kors and a mosque next to and overlooking the perimeter.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the glass ceiling, which already is stopping women from climbing higher in success in the workplace, a parallel phenomenon called the [...] "glass escalator" [...] is occurring. This {{can be defined as}} how more men <b>are</b> <b>joining</b> fields that were previously occupied mainly by women, such as nursing and teaching, and within these job fields, the men are riding right past women and going straight to the top, similarly to if they were on an escalator and a woman was taking stairs. Men are being offered more promotions than women and even though women have worked just as hard, they are still not being offered the same chances as men are in some circumstances. The chart from Carolyn K. Broner, Ph.D. shows an example of the glass escalator in favor of men for female-dominant occupations in schools. While women have mostly occupied the position of teachers, men are taking the higher positions in school systems as deans or principals.|$|E

2500|$|Dissenting {{conservative}} Southern Presbyterian Churches {{joined the}} PCA {{until the early}} 1990s. [...] Early PCA growth was largely through secessions from the Southern Presbyterian Church (PCUS), which from 1983 to 1990 allowed churches to leave with their property. About 110 to 120 churches did come in {{during that period of}} time to the PCA with their properties, allowed by various PC(USA) Presbyteries. [...] Since that time, PCA growth has been largely through church planting and local congregational outreach rather than by transfers of entire churches from other denominations. PC(USA) ministers are now required to agree with the ordination of women, which the PCA opposes. [...] However, since 1996 about 23 PC(USA) congregations have joined the PCA. As of the 2014 PC(USA) General assembly, most churches withdrawing from the PC(USA) <b>are</b> <b>joining</b> the Evangelical Presbyterian Church or the newly formed ECO due to their acceptance of women ministers, though since then many conservative PC(USA) groups and even whole congregations have affiliated with the PCA.|$|E
