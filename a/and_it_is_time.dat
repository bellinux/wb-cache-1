500|$|The head {{of comedy}} at Television Centre deserves {{six of the}} best for {{bringing}} back Chalk (BBC1) for a second term. If the opening episode of the new series is anything to go by, we are in for six of the worst half-hours of comedy {{in the history of}} television ... It is no surprise that the show has been relegated to a late slot. It is a watershed for smut. Some of the jokes were in the worst possible taste. The standards of comedy are so pitiful, Galfast High School should not have been given a grant from TV licence-payers' money <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> it closed its gates for good. David Bamber ... deserves a better vehicle for his acting talents. He was lured into playing Eric Slatt because the character {{was supposed to be the}} classroom equivalent of Basil Fawlty. They are as different as Chalk and Cleese.|$|E
500|$|The The Moving Picture World {{reviewer}} {{found the}} subject to be too long, but did not find {{it to be a}} fault. The reviewer states, [...] "A domestic comedy with a different flavor. In fact, with a mince pie for a basis the flavor comes to resemble brandy very strongly by the time that the cook, the maid and the mistress of the house and her daughter have added the proper proportion of flavoring, neither one knowing that the others have done likewise. The humor in this piece centers around this pie. What happened to the guests who partook of it certainly draws upon the imagination. Imagine eight people, not to speak of the cat, getting drunk on the brandy in one mince pie! ... We do not single out this subject as being more evidently padded than others shown on the screen this week. Licensed as well as Independents were guilty <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> that the manufacturers realize the importance of the scenario end of matters. The mince pie episode was well done, which is the faint praise that we do not like to mete out to anyone." [...] Walton of The Moving Picture News was not amused by the plot and stated, [...] "To me the last scene had no humor. It was only the necessary ending to the beginning. True humor does not emanate from cognac." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror stated, [...] "This is the old story of too many cooks, and it is quite funny after the first scenes are out of the way. The early part of the film takes too much time with trivial details leading up to the final situation. ... A weak point in the story {{is the fact that the}} pie is cut into eight small pieces, making it difficult to believe in its remarkable power. Two pies would have been as easy to make as one and would have been more convincing. The character parts are all well taken, although the cook would have been better if she had not seized so many opportunities to talk directly at the camera." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{political}} party New Zealand First has frequently criticised immigration on economic, {{social and cultural}} grounds. New Zealand First leader Winston Peters has on several occasions characterised the rate of Asian immigration into New Zealand as too high; in 2004, he stated: [...] "We are being dragged into the status of an Asian colony <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> that New Zealanders were placed first in their own country." [...] On 26 April 2005, he said: [...] "Māori will be disturbed to know that in 17 years' time they will be outnumbered by Asians in New Zealand", an estimate disputed by Statistics New Zealand, the government's statistics bureau. Peters quickly rebutted that Statistics New Zealand has underestimated the growth-rate of the Asian community in the past.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{religious}} leaders oppose the embargo {{for a variety}} of reasons, including humanitarian and economic hardships the embargo imposes on Cubans. Pope John Paul II called for the end to the embargo during his 1979 pastoral visit to Mexico. Patriarch Bartholomew I called the embargo a [...] "historic mistake" [...] while visiting the island on January 25, 2004. A joint letter in 1998 from the Disciples of Christ and the United Church of Christ to the U.S. Senate called for the easing of economic restrictions against Cuba. While also opposing the embargo, the General Secretary of the National Council of Churches stated, [...] "We did not understand the depth of the suffering of Christians under communism. And we failed to really cry out under the communist oppression." [...] Rev. Jesse Jackson, Rev. Al Sharpton, and Minister Louis Farrakhan have also publicly opposed the embargo. On May 15, 2002 former President Jimmy Carter spoke in Havana, calling {{for an end to the}} embargo, saying [...] "Our two nations have been trapped in a destructive state of belligerence for 42 years, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> for us to change our relationship." [...] The US bishops called for an end to the embargo on Cuba, after Pope Benedict XVI's 2012 visit to the island.|$|E
