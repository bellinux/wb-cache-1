5|$|As with {{previous}} Sonic games, Sonic 3 uses rings, {{scattered throughout the}} levels, as a health system; when the player is attacked without rings, is crushed, falls off-screen, drowns, or exceeds the act's ten-minute limit, they lose a life {{and return to the}} most recently passed checkpoint. Dying with zero lives gives the player a game over. The levels also include power-ups in television monitors that, when hit, grant the character an extra life, temporary invincibility to most hazards, a number of rings, <b>a</b> <b>shield</b> that allows them to breathe underwater, <b>a</b> <b>shield</b> that allows them to withstand fire from enemy projectiles, or <b>a</b> <b>shield</b> that attracts nearby rings.|$|E

5|$|A similar {{system for}} the Church of England was {{approved}} in 1976. The traditions of Eastern Christian heraldry have less developed regulation. Eastern secular coats of arms often display <b>a</b> <b>shield</b> before a mantle topped with a crown.

5|$|In {{anticipation}} of {{the approval of the}} new five-cent coin, the Mint's chief engraver, James B. Longacre, had begun preparing designs and pattern coins in 1865. After rejecting pieces showing deceased presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, Treasury Secretary Hugh McCulloch decided on a design similar to Longacre's two-cent piece, with <b>a</b> <b>shield</b> on the obverse and a numeral 5 surrounded by stars and rays on the reverse. This {{has come to be known}} as the Shield nickel.|$|E

5|$|Mantises can be loosely {{categorized}} as being macropterous (long-winged), brachypterous (short-winged), micropterous (vestigial-winged), or apterous (wingless). If not wingless, a mantis has {{two sets of}} wings: the outer wings, or tegmina, are usually narrow and leathery. They function as camouflage and as <b>a</b> <b>shield</b> for the hind wings, which are clearer and more delicate.|$|E
5|$|Support: The Support-class {{characters}} provide backup to {{the other}} characters. They are equipped with a damage dealing weapon, such as a laser cutter, or <b>a</b> <b>shield</b> {{that can be used}} to protect other Hunters. They also have the ability to provide temporary shields for nearby allies. In Stage 2, they gain the ability to charge the shields of their companions hunters.|$|E
5|$|The Army {{wanted the}} vehicle to feature a commander’s weapons station, autocannon, coaxial weapon, and an {{anti-tank}} guided missile system. The weapons suite had to be manually operable when damaged and the commander's weapon station had to incorporate <b>a</b> <b>shield.</b> Additionally, a dismountable anti-armor weapon would be carried on board. The Army also stated that the weapon suite would emphasize modularity, be able to defeat other IFVs, and provide non-lethal capability to enable use in civilian environments.|$|E

40|$|ITO {{films were}} {{deposited}} by HPPMS sputtering {{at room temperature}} and 300 °C. The film properties were compared to properties obtained by conventional DC sputtering. In both cases the film properties were found to strongly depend {{on the amount of}} oxygen added to tlie sputtering gas. In the case of HPPMS sputtering the film properties also strongly depend on the peak power density determined by the charge voltage. For low temperature deposition the HPPMS sputtering process proved to be superior in terms of resistivity obtained for the highest charge voltages used. At 300 °C state-of-the-art ITO films are obtained by DC sputtering for-optimized oxygen flow using <b>a</b> <b>shielding.</b> For low oxygen flows or without <b>a</b> <b>shielding</b> DC sputtering led to undesired strong spike foration. For HPPMS sputtering without <b>a</b> <b>shielding</b> it was possible to prevent spike fomation by using high charge voltages. It was possible to obtain flat films with a lowest resistivity of 135 µOhm or in-line production this means that high quality films can be obtained by HPPMS sputtering without the need for <b>a</b> <b>shielding</b> that strongly reduce deposition rate...|$|R
40|$|Electrodeposition was {{studied at}} one-hundreth g and {{compared}} with bench studies at 1 g. The low gravity was achieved during KC- 135 aircraft parobolic flights. Flow {{in a simple}} cobalt cell (1 M CoSO 4) operating under typical commercial conditions (10 to 20 mA/sq cm and 1 V) was monitored with a Schlieren optical system. Natural convection was absent at one-hundreth g. Quantitative comparisons on a cobalt cell with shielded electrodes using interferometry were carried out. Fringe shift differences indicate greater semi-infinite linear diffusion at 1 g than at one-hundreth g for cobalt. Since <b>a</b> <b>shielded</b> electrode operates under diffusion controlled conditions, no differences between 1 g and one-hundreth g would be expected. Similar comparisons on <b>a</b> <b>shielded</b> electrode copper cell were inconclusive. Bench codeposition experiments using polystyrene neutral buoyancy particles coupled with <b>a</b> <b>shielded</b> electrode cobalt cell were begun. Tracking of 12 micron particles showed no measurable difference between thermal/Brownian motion when the cell was operational or nonoperational. Initial experiments on codeposition quality showed a strong dependence upon cathode surface preparation in <b>a</b> <b>shielded</b> electrode configuration...|$|R
5|$|The {{emblem of}} the Order was {{designed}} by Past Supreme Knight James T. Mullen and adopted at the second Supreme Council meeting on May 12, 1883. Shields used by medieval knights served as the inspiration. The emblem consists of <b>a</b> <b>shield</b> mounted on a Formée cross, which is an artistic representation of the cross of Christ. This represents the Catholic identity of the Order.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, 1949–50, {{with the}} Australian Test team in South Africa {{for the whole}} of the southern hemisphere summer, Victoria lost batsmen Lindsay Hassett, Sam Loxton and Neil Harvey. Despite the extra vacancies, Ray was only selected for one match, against Tasmania, making 9 and 45 in a four-wicket win. This was effectively a second-choice Victorian team as the leading players were involved in <b>a</b> <b>Shield</b> match against New South Wales at the same time.|$|E
5|$|The {{instruments}} of the Passion were sometimes split between <b>a</b> <b>shield</b> and crest {{in the form}} of an achievement of arms (Neubecker, 222). The Hyghalmen Roll (c. 1447–1455) shows Christ holding an azure shield charged with Veronica's Veil proper. The heraldry continues with the 15th century jousting helmet, which is covered by the seamless robe as a form of mantling, and the Cross, scepter (of mockery) and flagellum (whip) as crest. The banner's long red schwenkel is a mark of eminence in German heraldry, but it was omitted when this image was copied into Randle Holme's Book (c. 1464–1480). The image on the opposing page (shown above) includes <b>a</b> <b>shield</b> quartered with the five Wounds of Christ, three jars of ointment, two rods, and the head of Judas Iscariot with a bag of money (Dennys, 97–98).|$|E
