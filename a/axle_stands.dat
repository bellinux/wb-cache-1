50|$|Meanwhile, the Tories are {{bringing}} a mentally disabled man to vote. A dying man is being carried in behind him. In the background {{a woman in}} a carriage with a broken <b>axle</b> <b>stands</b> for Britannia. Her coachmen are gambling, ignoring the fact that the carriage is broken.|$|E
50|$|In period it's {{unlikely}} that a relatively modern military lorry {{would have been}} sacrificed in this way, being too valuable to replace losses after Dunkirk. The museum's Bison was built relatively recently, from an original rear pillbox on a different original chassis, with the front cab section being a modern reproduction by the Museum of Army Transport in Beverley. The suspension of this example rests on <b>axle</b> <b>stands</b> to avoid flattening the tyres.|$|E
5000|$|A literal {{flat spot}} can occur on car tires if {{the vehicle is}} parked without moving for some time (generally longer than a week), and the tire {{deformation}} {{at the bottom of}} the wheel becomes semi-permanent. The flat spot gradually relieves itself when the car is driven but can temporarily give similar symptoms to an unbalanced wheel. Cars being laid up for extended periods, or intermittently-used caravans and trailers, should be kept on <b>axle</b> <b>stands</b> (tyres not in contact with the ground) or have the tires over-inflated to eliminate or reduce this problem. [...] "Tire savers", curved wheel stands, are also available for use during storage. These reduce or avoid the problem by cradling the lower part of the tire tread and preventing the usual deformation where it rests on the ground.|$|E
5000|$|A {{wheel truing}} stand is a {{specialized}} tool for [...] "truing" [...] (straightening) bicycle wheels. Individual models differ slightly, but all consist of an <b>axle</b> <b>stand</b> {{on which the}} wheel can rotate and calipers, to measure slight deviations of the wheel's rim from ideal alignment. The stand is {{used in conjunction with}} an appropriately sized spoke wrench to loosen or tighten the spokes that connect the wheel's hub to the rim.|$|R
50|$|In 1924 an {{employee}} demonstrated the K R Wilson Combination Machine. Within three hours he relined the crankshaft bearings, bored them to accurate size and re-bored four cylinders {{to a standard}} Ford size. The work would previously have taken 18 to 20 hours. A special assembly bench by Manley Motor Support assisted with quick and accurate re-assembly. The machinery was claimed to bring factory exactness to the local garage and ensure a full 12,000 miles of running without further attention. Other machinery for the same purpose included the Wright Multi-valve Grinder which grinds 4 valves at once, the Ames Cylinder Gauge, the Wilson Crankcase Aligning Jig and Weaver <b>Axle</b> <b>Stand.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Since the 345 model {{disappeared}} in 1939 Scania-Vabis had only built conventional trucks, {{since it was}} the most popular design in the Scandinavian market. By the early 1960s, many European countries introduced regulations limiting the maximum length for truck and trailer. This resulted in increased demand for forward control trucks. With the introduction of the L76 series there was also a forward control version, LB76 (LBS76 with trailaing <b>axle).</b> The “B” <b>stood</b> for [...] "Bulldog" [...] which was Scania-Vabis’ name for forward control vehicles. The LB cab was fixed, which made access to the engine for service difficult.|$|R
25|$|Solon's {{laws were}} inscribed on large wooden slabs or {{cylinders}} {{attached to a}} series of <b>axles</b> that <b>stood</b> upright in the Prytaneion. These axones appear to have operated on the same principle as a Lazy Susan, allowing both convenient storage and ease of access. Originally the axones recorded laws enacted by Draco in the late 7th Century (traditionally 621 BC). Nothing of Draco's codification has survived except for a law relating to homicide, yet there is consensus among scholars that it did not amount to anything like a constitution. Solon repealed all Draco's laws except those relating to homicide. During his visit to Athens, Pausanias, the 2nd century AD geographer reported that the inscribed laws of Solon were still displayed by the Prytaneion. Fragments of the axones were still visible in Plutarch's time but today the only records we have of Solon's laws are fragmentary quotes and comments in literary sources such as those written by Plutarch himself. Moreover, the language of his laws was archaic even {{by the standards of the}} fifth century and this caused interpretation problems for ancient commentators. Modern scholars doubt the reliability of these sources and our knowledge of Solon's legislation is therefore actually very limited in its details.|$|R
60|$|By this oblique motion, {{the island}} is {{conveyed}} to {{different parts of the}} monarch’s dominions. To explain the manner of its progress, let A B represent a line drawn across the dominions of Balnibarbi, let the line c d represent the loadstone, of which let d be the repelling end, and c the attracting end, the island being over C: let the stone be placed in position c d, with its repelling end downwards; then the island will be driven upwards obliquely towards D. When it is arrived at D, let the stone be turned upon its axle, till its attracting end points towards E, and then the island will be carried obliquely towards E; where, if the stone be again turned upon its <b>axle</b> till it <b>stands</b> in the position E F, with its repelling point downwards, the island will rise obliquely towards F, where, by directing the attracting end towards G, the island may be carried to G, and from G to H, by turning the stone, so as to make its repelling extremity to point directly downward. And thus, by changing the situation of the stone, as often as there is occasion, {{the island is}} made to rise and fall by turns in an oblique direction, and by those alternate risings and fallings (the obliquity being not considerable) is conveyed from one part of the dominions to the other.|$|R
50|$|Construction {{began on}} the TIV in 2003 and cost over $80,000. Sean began concept of the TIV after having to use rented minivans to storm chase, and being unable to get up close to a tornado. The windows are bullet {{resistant}} polycarbonate at 1.5 in thick. There's a 7.3-liter Ford Power Stroke turbodiesel under the hood, and the top speed is 85 mi/h km/h. The TIV weighs in at 8 ST and holds 60 gal of fuel.Construction began on TIV2 in September 2007 with help from Great Plains Technology Center in Lawton, Oklahoma after Sean realized he needed to upgrade his vehicle. TIV2 weighs in at 7 ST and is a 4-wheel drive, 3 <b>axle</b> vehicle. It <b>stands</b> taller than the original TIV and is capable of going on mud and unpaved roads without the fear of getting stuck. The original TIV has 2-wheel drive and extremely low ground clearance that would cause it to get stuck on unpaved roads. It {{is powered by a}} 6.7-liter Cummins turbodiesel engine, modified with propane and water injection to produce 625 horsepower. This gives TIV2 an estimated top speed of over 110 mi/h km/h. Fuel capacity is 95 gal in a custom fuel tank, giving TIV2 an approximate range over 750 mi. The body of TIV2 is constructed of a 1/8-inch steel skin welded over a 2 in square tubing steel frame. The windows in TIV2 are all bullet resistant 1 5/8 inch interlayered polycarbonate sheets and tempered glass. TIV2 also features an IMAX filming turret similar to the one on the original TIV. The original TIV's somewhat cumbersome hydraulic claws were not used on TIV2 in favor of four hydraulic skirts that drop down to deflect wind over the TIV to stabilize it and protect the underside from debris plus two stakes that extend down 42 in. The stakes were so effective that after the first use TIV2 could not retract the stakes and they had to be dug out by hand.|$|R
