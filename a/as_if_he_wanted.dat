25|$|After the Emperor's death, Prime Minister Li Si, who {{accompanied}} him, became extremely {{worried that the}} news of his death could trigger a general uprising in the Empire. It would take two months for the entourage to reach the capital, {{and it would not}} be possible to stop the uprising. Li Si decided to hide the death of the Emperor, and return to Xianyang. Most of the Imperial entourage accompanying the Emperor were left ignorant of the Emperor's death; only a younger son, Ying Huhai, who was travelling with his father, the eunuch Zhao Gao, Li Si, and five or six favourite eunuchs knew of the death. Li Si also ordered that two carts containing rotten fish be carried immediately before and after the wagon of the Emperor. The idea behind this was to prevent people from noticing the foul smell emanating from the wagon of the Emperor, where his body was starting to decompose severely as it was summertime. They also pulled down the shade so no one could see his face, changed his clothes daily, brought food and when he had to have important conversations, they would act <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to send them a message.|$|E
500|$|In his 2011 book The Man Behind the Man: Looking From the Inside Out, Demetrius Smith Sr., {{a former}} member of R. Kelly's entourage, wrote that R. Kelly told him [...] "in a voice that sounded <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to burst into tears" [...] that he thought Aaliyah was pregnant.|$|E
2500|$|They {{were walking}} along the {{promenade}} when the 25-year-old Italian anarchist Luigi Lucheni approached them, attempting to peer underneath the empress's parasol. According to Sztáray, as the ship's bell announced the departure, Lucheni seemed to stumble and made a movement with his hand <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to maintain his balance. In reality, {{in an act of}} [...] "propaganda of the deed", he had stabbed Elisabeth with a sharpened needle file that was [...] long (used to file the eyes of industrial needles) that he had inserted into a wooden handle.|$|E
50|$|The Full House {{inhabitants}} {{all live}} under the same roof, {{and it seems that}} everything is okay. But that doesn't last for long. The owner of the apartment appears <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to sell it. Tamara saves them by buying the apartment. She leases it to the Full House inhabitants, along with certain conditions.|$|R

6000|$|... "Don't {{want to be}} soup!" [...] wailed Button-Bright again; and Toto {{began to}} whine dismally, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> didn't <b>want</b> to be soup, either.|$|R
2500|$|... "My {{last meeting}} with Abdus Salam {{was only three}} months ago. His disease had taken its toll and {{he was unable to}} talk. Yet he {{understood}} what was said. I told him about the celebration held in Pakistan on his seventieth birthday. He kept staring at me. He had risen above praise. As I rose to leave he pressed my hand to express his feelings <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to thank everyone who had said kind words about him. Dr. Abdus Salam had deep love for Pakistan {{in spite of the fact}} that he was treated unfairly and indifferently by his own country. It became more and more difficult for him to come to Pakistan and this hurt him deeply. Now he has returned home finally, to rest in peace for ever in the soil that he loved so much. May be in the years to come we will rise above our prejudice and own him and give him, after his death, what we could not when he was alive. We Pakistanis may choose to ignore Dr. Salam, but the world at large will always remember him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fletch {{received}} generally positive {{reviews and}} has a 75% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 28 critics with the consensus: [...] "Quotably funny -- and fast-paced enough to smooth over the jokes that don't land -- Fletch {{is one of the}} best big-screen vehicles for Chevy Chase's brand of smug silliness". Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, [...] "The problem is, Chase's performance tends to reduce all the scenes to the same level, at least as far as he is concerned. He projects such an inflexible mask of cool detachment, of ironic running commentary, that we're prevented from identifying with him [...] [...] [...] Fletch needed an actor more interested in playing the character than in playing himself." [...] Vincent Canby in his review for The New York Times praised Chase's performance, writing, [...] "He manages simultaneously to act the material with a good deal of nonchalance and to float above it, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> us to know that he knows that the whole enterprise is somewhat less than transcendental." [...] Time magazine's Richard Schickel wrote, [...] "In Fletch, the quick, smartly paced, gags somehow read as signs of vulnerability. Incidentally, they add greatly to the movie's suspense. Every minute you expect the hero's loose lip to be turned into a fat one." [...] In his review for the Chicago Reader, Dave Kehr wrote, [...] "Chase and Ritchie make a strong, natural combination: the union of their two flip, sarcastic personalities produces a fairly definitive example of the comic style of the 80s, grounded in detachment, underreaction, and cool contempt for rhetorically overblown authority figures." ...|$|E

50|$|Jiao Ting {{wishes to}} join the bandit gang on Mount Deadwood (枯樹山) in Kouzhou (寇州; {{believed}} to be present-day Guan County, Liaocheng, Shandong) and travels there. He encounters Li Kui along the way and stares at him. The fiery-tempered Li Kui is unhappy when he sees Jiao Ting staring at him, so he raises his fists <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to fight Jiao, but Jiao remains unfazed by Li's bravado and fearsome appearance. Li Kui attacks Jiao Ting but he is defeated by his opponent, who wrestles {{him to the ground}} easily.|$|R

6000|$|... "Strange {{would leave}} a trail a trapper could follow. Then I don't see why Steve stops here instead of {{locating}} on better hunting ground. It looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> didn't <b>want</b> {{to leave the}} Shadow." ...|$|R
60|$|He looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to cry {{but thought}} better of it and bit off a mouthful of candy.|$|E
60|$|He {{kept his}} eyes fixed on her, and there was a faintly {{perceptible}} motion of the lips, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to speak.|$|E

6000|$|Holley at last spoke: [...] "She's up {{on a wild}} stallion. He's red, like fire. He's mighty big--strong. Looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> didn't <b>want</b> to go {{near the}} bunch. Lord! what action! ... Bostil, I'd say--a great hoss!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind; but {{will you be}} good enough to tell about yourself?" [...] said Freddy again; for the bone seemed to avoid that part of the story, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> didn't <b>want</b> to tell it.|$|R

6000|$|Averil looked wistfully after him, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were <b>wanted</b> to {{complete}} full felicity even in Leonard's presence. How little would they once {{have thought that}} her first words to her brother would be, 'Oh, was there ever any one like him?' ...|$|R
50|$|The rider, {{no matter}} which bit is used, when turning should pull the bit enough to create a response, {{but not so much}} that the horse tosses his head aside. At the instant where the horse raises his neck to the pull, the rider should give the bit and lighten the {{pressure}} as a reward. Therefore, when the horse is enjoying arching his neck and carrying his head high, the rider should not ask the horse for severe exertion, but be gentle, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to give the horse a rest. The horse will then be more likely to take up a rapid pace, as a horse enjoys moving at a rapid pace, as long as he is not asked to do so excessively.|$|R
60|$|This {{irruption}} of Nutty Boyd {{into his}} life was an omen. It meant that all was not yet over. He was conscious of a mild surprise that he had ever intended {{to go to bed}}. <b>He</b> felt now <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> never <b>wanted</b> to go to bed again. He felt exhilarated.|$|R

5000|$|Jeffers {{will face}} off against Nisbett again in Nevis Island {{elections}} in 2012.
