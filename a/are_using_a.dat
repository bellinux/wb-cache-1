The lead photographer of the project, Ardon Bar-Hama, and his team are utilizing the Alpa 12 MAX camera accompanied with a Leaf Aptus-II back in order to produce ultra-high resolution digital images of the scrolls and fragments.

25|$|An October 2014 {{publication}} {{by researchers}} from the University of Queensland stated that the compound eyes of mantis shrimp can detect cancer and the activity of neurons, because they are sensitive to detecting polarised light that reflects differently from cancerous and healthy tissue. The study claims that this ability can be replicated through a camera {{through the use of}} aluminium nanowires to replicate polarisation-filtering microvilli on top of photodiodes. In February 2016 it was also revealed that the shrimps <b>are</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> form of reflector of polarised light not seen in nature or human technology before. It allows the manipulation of light across the structure rather than through its depth, the typical way polarisers work. This allows the structure to be both small and microscopically thin, and still be able to produce big, bright, colourful polarised signals.|$|E
25|$|Drag hunting, an equestrian sport which {{involves}} dragging an object {{over the ground}} to lay a scent for the hounds to follow, can also be popular, either instead of, or in addition to, live quarry hunting. Drag hunts are often considered to be faster, with followers not having to wait while the hounds pick up a scent, and often covering an area far larger than a traditional hunt, which may even necessitate a change of horses halfway through. A non-equestrian variation, hound trailing, is practised in the Lake District. Since the UK hunting ban, hunts <b>are</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> mixture of an odoriferous substance with an oil {{in order to improve}} the persistence of the scent trail, and then to lay the scent about 20minutes in advance of the hunt. Bloodhounds are also used to hunt a human runner in the sport of Hunting the Clean Boot.|$|E
500|$|Inaba stated, [...] "We {{wanted to}} create a {{challenging}} game with stunning visuals and fluid gameplay". As a lifelong fan of superheroes, Inaba's aim was to combine traditional Japanese tokusatsu with American comic books. The character designs created by Kumiko Suekane were inspired specifically by 1960s and 1970s Japanese-costumed tokusatsu television shows such as Kamen Rider and Ultraman. Graphically, the game adopted a 2D side-scrolling style mixed with 3D cel-shaded animation. Despite many games in the then-modern industry shying away from 2D graphical formats, Inaba said, [...] "We have been able to breathe new life into the genre because we <b>are</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> new stylistic way that hasn't been seen before." [...] The team chose the GameCube as its platform because of their target audience and because it lent itself well to Viewtiful Joes gameplay.|$|E

500|$|Virtually all the {{historically}} known {{plant and animal}} species, {{with the exception of}} the bison and woodland caribou, are still present, providing biologists with an intact ecosystem for plant and animal research. Two threatened species of mammals, the grizzly bear and the Canadian lynx, are found in the park. Although their numbers remain at historical levels, both are listed as threatened because in nearly every other region of the U.S. outside of Alaska, they are either extremely rare or absent from their historical range. On average, one or two bear attacks on humans occur each year; since the creation of the park in 1910, there have been a total of 10 bear-related deaths. The number of grizzlies and lynx in the park is not known for certain, but park biologists believed as of 2008 that there were just above 300 grizzlies in the park; a study which commenced in 2001 hopes to determine the number of lynx. The exact population figures for grizzlies and the smaller black bear are not known but biologists <b>are</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> variety of methods to try to determine an accurate population range. Another study has indicated that the wolverine, another very rare mammal in the lower 48 states, also lives in the park. Other mammals such as the mountain goat (the official park symbol), bighorn sheep, moose, elk, mule deer, skunk, white-tailed deer, bobcat, coyote, and cougar are either plentiful or common. Unlike in Yellowstone National Park, which implemented [...] a wolf reintroduction program in the 1990s, it is believed that wolves recolonized Glacier National Park naturally during the 1980s. Sixty-two species of mammals have been documented including badger, river otter, porcupine, mink, marten, fisher, six species of bat and numerous other smaller mammals.|$|E
500|$|In the video, Janet Jackson {{takes on}} a darker persona, {{previously}} unseen in her own music videos. Jim Farber of the New York Daily News described her as [...] "Sporting a thick thatch of wig hair, and eyes darkened by coal-black makeup... sullen and arty... Janet, however, never looked tougher, or more in control." [...] In the video, a sign appears with the logo of the song's title. The scene then changes a spacecraft traveling past Earth before the camera zooms in inside. Then, the lights came on and reveal Michael and Janet inside a small hole. Suddenly, the spacecraft zooms out through the outer part of the galaxy, sending them screaming. In the first verse, Michael {{is seen in the}} room where he is floating on gravity. Then, Michael is shown in a room with thousands of guitars where he breaks one while Janet sings the next verse. Then, it shows Michael dancing on the wall while Janet looks at her nail before playing a game of tag. Then, it shows Michael and Janet in a room where they <b>are</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> remote control by changing pictures of Gregory Peck, art painting, statues, etc. Next, it shows both Michael and Janet in the media room where they are playing a video game which Michael wins. Then, Janet sports a skimpy bikini in some scenes while {{at the core of the}} craft, grabs at her breasts, gives the camera a middle finger and simulates male urination where Michael is shown taking controls into some kind of Observation. (In the out-takes, there is a still color photograph of Michael also giving the camera a middle finger.) Meanwhile, Michael is seen in a white room while wearing a black robe where he is meditating before screaming which breaks the glass above him. Then, Michael and Janet perform a dance breakdown. Then, it cuts back to the media room where Janet is dancing with Michael being seen on the television screen while Janet does the same thing with Michael. Then, Michael is seen playing a tennis game where he is using a robotic orb to break jars. The video has influences of Japanese sci-fi Anime - several clips of the Zillion anime series, Vampire Hunter D 1985 movie, and the movie Akira can be seen in the background screens. The version of the video included on Michael Jackson's Vision is uncut and contains the [...] "Stop fucking with me" [...] lyric, which was censored in HIStory on Film, Volume II.|$|E
