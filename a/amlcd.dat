50|$|The {{most common}} type of <b>AMLCD</b> contains, besides the {{polarizing}} sheets and cells of liquid crystal, a matrix of thin-film transistors to make a thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display.

40|$|Active Matrix Liquid Crystal Display (<b>AMLCD)</b> {{has been}} well {{recognized}} as a display technology for high-resolution flat-panel and projection displays. As a consequence, ever increasing research efforts have been devoted to improve {{every aspect of the}} <b>AMLCD</b> technology, including liquid crystal materials, display optics, color filters, panel fabrications and display drivers. At HKUST, we have developed a novel <b>AMLCD</b> technology in which the active matrix was fabricated on silicon substrate. The advantages of using silicon are its better electronic properties and more matured fabrication technology. Very sophisticated driver circuitry and fine pixels can be integrated into a single chip on which the liquid crystal cell is formed. In this thesis research work, a video interface controller, {{as a part of the}} <b>AMLCD</b> system, for driving the silicon based <b>AMLCD</b> panel was developed. By using field programmable gate array (FPGA) as an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), system design flexibility and fast prototyping were achieved.

Dual use avionics versions of <b>AMLCD</b> technology are now as large as 6. 7 x 6. 7 in. active display area in the ARINC D sized color multifunction display (MFD). This is the standard instrument in all new Boeing transport aircraft and is being retrofitted into the C- 17 A. A special design of the ARINC D instrument {{is used in the}} Space Shuttle cockpit upgrade. Larger sizes of <b>AMLCD</b> were desired when decisions were made in the early 1990 s for the F- 22.

40|$|Polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) {{thin film}} {{transistor}} (TFT) technology is very suitable for driving an active matrix LCD (<b>AMLCD)</b> panel as the driver circuit, and the panel can be integrated on the same substrate. This allows the entire display system to be thin and makes the concepts of `TV on wall' and `sheet computer' possible. However, the large variation of threshold voltage of poly-Si TFT across the wafer {{makes it difficult to}} obtain analogue amplifiers with constant gain and phase margin. In this paper, an analogue data driver for the poly-Si TFT <b>AMLCD</b> is proposed. An operational amplifier with a gate bias-voltage generation circuit for this analogue data driver, with characteristics independent of variations in threshold voltage, will be presented. In Hspice simulation, with threshold voltage varying from 2. 5 V to 4. 5 V, gain variations of the proposed amplifier were reduced from +/- 10 dB to +/- 0. 2 dB and phase margin variations were reduced from 10 degrees to 0. 37 degrees compared with typical operational amplifier design.
