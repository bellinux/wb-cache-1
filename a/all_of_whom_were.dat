5|$|Mariah Carey is {{the debut}} studio album by American singer Mariah Carey, {{released}} on June 12, 1990 by Columbia Records. Its music incorporates {{a range of}} contemporary genres {{with a mix of}} slow ballads and up-tempo tracks. Originally, Carey wrote four songs with Ben Margulies, which solely constituted her demo tape. While altered and partially re-sung after being signed to Columbia, all four songs made the final cut for the album. Aside from Margulies, Carey worked with a range of professional writers and producers, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>were</b> hired by Columbia CEO, Tommy Mottola. Mariah Carey featured production and writing from Rhett Lawrence, Ric Wake and Narada Michael Walden, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>were</b> top record producers at the time. Together with Carey, they conceived the album and reconstructed her original demo tape.|$|E

5|$|Arana's support {{began to}} be {{solicited}} by the landed elite, who felt threatened by Arévalo's reforms. Arana, who was not initially inclined {{to get involved with}} politics, began to make occasional statements against the government. In the 1948 parliamentary election, he backed a number of opposition candidates, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>were</b> defeated. By 1949 the National Renovation Party and the PAR were both openly hostile to Arana, while a small fragment of the Popular Liberation Front split off to support him. The leftist parties decided to back Árbenz instead, as they believed that only a military officer could defeat Arana.|$|E

5|$|At 14:30 on 6 November, UB-45 was departing Varna, Bulgaria, under escort by the Bulgarian {{torpedo boat}} Strogi that had cleared {{a path through}} Russian mines. At what {{was thought to be}} the edge of the minefield, UB-45 swung around Strogis port side {{directly}} into a second minefield that had been laid by Russian forces the night before. A Hertz horn mine exploded between UB-45s control room and engine room with enough force to break the boat in half. UB-45 sank so rapidly that the only survivors were three men on the conning tower and two on deck, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>were</b> injured; the other fifteen men on board perished in the attack. One of the survivors died from the severity of his wounds the following day.|$|E
5|$|Chesney died in 1174, {{having had}} three daughters {{with his wife}} Gilla. Her ancestry is unknown, and it is {{possible}} that William married another time, to Aubrey de Poynings, because a Lewes Priory charter dated to around 1165 names a William de Chesney and Aubrey his wife, {{but it is not clear}} whether this charter is referring to William de Chesney the sheriff or to another William. William and Gilla's daughters were Margaret, Clemence, and Sara, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>were</b> unmarried at the time of their father's death. Margaret married twice– first to Hugh de Cressy and second to Robert fitzRoger. Clemence married Jordan de Sackville, and Sara married Richard Engaine.

It was led by Mario Sandoval Alarcón, and was a coalition of municipal politicians, bureaucrats, coffee planters, {{and members of the}} military, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>were</b> opposed to the reforms of the Guatemalan Revolution. In the congressional elections held under Castillo Armas, it was the only party allowed to run.|$|E

Accompanied by Calvert, Joliot-Curie {{was flown}} to London where Perrin and Goudsmit interviewed {{him about the}} {{activities}} of German scientists. Joliot-Curie recalled visits to the College, which had a cyclotron, by German scientists including Erich Schumann, who had initiated the German nuclear project, and controlled it until it had been {{handed over to the}} Reichsforschungsrat (National Research Council) in 1942; by Abraham Esau, who had been in charge of nuclear physics under the Reichsforschungsrat; and by Walter Gerlach, who had replaced him in January 1944.

In this condensed version some {{songs from the}} show were sung, but Julie was played by a non-singing Gloria Holden. This version made the biracial Julie a single woman. Only a few lines of Ol' Man River were heard, sung by a chorus. While supposedly based on the 1936 film, this production used {{the ending of the}} original show, which the film did not use.|$|E
5|$|Raëlians {{believe that}} {{throughout}} the ages, members of the Elohim civilization sent different prophets, including Moses, Jesus, Buddha and many others whose role was to guide humanity and to prepare humans for the future, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>were</b> created {{as a result of}} a sexual union between a human woman and one of the Elohim. To Raëlians, this was possible because the Elohim had advanced DNA synthesis and genetic engineering. The Elohim later reduced the frequent visits so that humans were largely left to progress on their own, until the time of the Apocalypse/Revelation when they would send their final messenger and disclose themselves at an extraterrestrial embassy, establishing political and economic ties.|$|E
