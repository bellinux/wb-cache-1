5|$|Edgardo found {{shelter in}} a convent of the Canons Regular in Austria, {{where he lived}} under <b>an</b> <b>assumed</b> name. In 1872 he moved to a monastery at Poitiers in France, where Pope Pius {{regularly}} corresponded with the bishop about the young man. After a year, Pio Edgardo Mortara was ordained as a priest—with special dispensation as at 21 he was technically too young. He received a personal letter from the Pope to mark the occasion, {{as well as a}} lifetime trust fund of 7,000 lire to support him.|$|E

In 1959 he started working for L'Ora, a Communist-oriented paper. Other journalists were puzzled about De Mauro's presence at the newspaper: {{he had been a}} supporter of Mussolini until the bitter end and fought in the brutal war against the anti-Fascist partisans. Rumour had it that his nose had been broken by partisans.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} marred by the revelation that a Texas player had been {{competing}} under <b>an</b> <b>assumed</b> name. Other off-the-field incidents also took place prior to the game. Because the game was Virginia Tech's first trip to a major bowl game, ticket sales were brisk. Texas took an early lead in the competition and led 107 at halftime, but Virginia Tech's defense shut out Texas' offense {{in the second half}} and Tech scored 21 unanswered points. In recognition of his achievements in the game, Virginia Tech wide receiver Bryan Still was named the game's most valuable player.|$|E
5|$|During {{the joint}} Italian–Chetnik Operation Alfa, Jevđević's Chetniks, {{along with other}} Chetnik forces, were {{responsible}} for killing between 543 and 2,500 Bosnian Muslim and Catholic civilians in the Prozor region in October 1942. They also participated {{in one of the}} largest Axis anti-Partisan operations of the war, Case White, in the winter of 1943. His Chetniks later merged with other collaborationist forces that had withdrawn towards the west, and were put under the command of the SS General Odilo Globocnik of the Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral. Jevđević fled to Italy in the spring of 1945, where he was arrested by Allied military authorities and detained at a camp in Grottaglie. He was eventually set free, having received considerable Allied support. Yugoslavia's requests for extradition were ignored. Jevđević moved to Rome and lived under <b>an</b> <b>assumed</b> name. In the years following the war, he collected reports for various western intelligence services and printed anti-communist publications. He resided in Rome until his death in October 1962.|$|E

5|$|Following his recovery, Liddell {{travelled}} to Canada {{to complete}} a course at the Central Navigation School and became a pilot officer navigator. While on leave, he {{was used as a}} substitute by the Toronto Scottish under <b>an</b> <b>assumed</b> name and scored twice in a semi-final play-off. He was recalled to Moncton, New Brunswick, before the final. After some seven months in Canada, Liddell returned to Britain and, when based in Perth in 1944, accepted an offer to guest for his boyhood favourites Dunfermline Athletic. He subsequently moved to Northern Ireland for further training, where he declined an offer from former Liverpool goalkeeper Elisha Scott to guest for Belfast Celtic because of a prior agreement to play for Linfield. By the end of the war, Liddell had been assigned to 617 Squadron, helping to transport Allied soldiers back to Britain on leave from Italy.|$|E
5|$|In an {{alternative}} scenario, the exozodiacal dust may be generated in an outer belt that is orbiting between 55 and 90AU from Epsilon Eridani and has <b>an</b> <b>assumed</b> mass of 10−3 times {{the mass of}} Earth. This dust is then transported inward past the orbit of Epsilon Eridani b. When collisions between the dust grains are taken into account, the dust will reproduce the observed infrared spectrum and brightness. Outside the radius of ice sublimation, located beyond 10AU from Epsilon Eridani where the temperatures fall below 100K, the best fit to the observations occurs when a mix of ice and silicate dust is assumed. Inside this radius, the dust must consist of silicate grains that lack volatiles.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} marriage, Carrouges {{revealed}} another {{motive for the}} union. The valuable estate of Arnou-le-Faucon, given to his rival Jacques Le Gris two years earlier, had been formerly owned by Carrouges' father-in-law and had been bought by Count Pierre for 8,000 French livres in 1377. Carrouges immediately began a lawsuit to recover the land based on <b>an</b> <b>assumed</b> prior claim to it. The case dragged on for some months until ultimately Count Pierre was forced to visit his cousin King Charles VI to officially confirm his ownership {{of the land and}} his right to give it to whomever of his followers he chose. Despite losing the case, the lawsuit reflected very poorly on Carrouges at the court in Argentan and resulted in his further estrangement from Count Pierre's circle.|$|E

5|$|The biggest off-the-field {{incident}} was revealed {{on the final}} weekend before the Sugar Bowl. Texas reserve defensive back Ron McKelvey was revealed to be using <b>an</b> <b>assumed</b> name. In reality, he was a 30-year-old man named Ron Weaver who had played for a junior-college team and a small-college team under other assumed names. Weaver disappeared prior to the Sugar Bowl, but stated that he had used the assumed name in order to gather information for {{a book about the}} inner workings of Texas football. Weaver later pleaded guilty to a felony charge of misusing Social Security numbers, but he avoided jail and paid no fine. Texas was not sanctioned by the NCAA, but Longhorns players later said the event was a severe distraction from pre-game preparations.|$|E
5|$|Though {{most of the}} Jews {{still alive}} in Linz after the war had emigrated, Wiesenthal decided to stay on, partly because the family of Adolf Eichmann lived {{a few blocks away}} from him. Eichmann had been in charge of the {{transportation}} and deportation of Jews in the Nazi Final Solution to the Jewish Question: a plan, finalised at the Wannsee Conference—at which Eichmann took the minutes—to exterminate all the Jews in Europe. After the war, Eichmann hid in Austria using forged identity papers until 1950, when he left via Italy and moved to Argentina under <b>an</b> <b>assumed</b> name. Hoping to obtain information on Eichmann's whereabouts, Wiesenthal continuously monitored the remaining members of the immediate family in Linz until they vanished in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Barry Lyndon (1975) is an {{adaptation}} of William Makepeace Thackeray's The Luck of Barry Lyndon (also known as Barry Lyndon), a picaresque novel about the adventures of an 18th-century Irish rogue and social climber. John Calley of Warner Bros. agreed in 1972 to invest $2.5 million into the film, on condition that Kubrick approach major Hollywood stars, to ensure it of success. Like previous films, Kubrick and his art department conducted {{an enormous amount of}} research, and he went from knowing very little about the 18th century {{at the start of the}} production to becoming an expert on it. Extensive photographs were taken of locations and artwork in particular, and paintings were meticulously replicated from works of the great masters of the period in the film. The film was shot on location in Ardmore, County Waterford, Ireland, beginning in the autumn of 1973, at a cost of $11 million with a cast and crew of 170. The decision to shoot in Ireland stemmed from the fact that it still retained many buildings from the 18th century period which England lacked. The production was problematic from the start, plagued with heavy rain and political strife involving Northern Ireland at the time. After Kubrick received death threats from the IRA in the New Year of 1974 due to the shooting scenes with English soldiers, he fled Ireland with his family on a ferry from Dún Laoghaire under <b>an</b> <b>assumed</b> identity, and filming resumed in England.|$|E
