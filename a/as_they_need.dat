5|$|The V7 {{client is}} {{the seventh and}} latest {{generation}} of the Folding@home client software, and is a full rewrite and unification of the prior clients for Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. It was released on March22, 2012. Like its predecessors, V7 can run Folding@home in the background at a very low priority, allowing other applications to use CPU resources <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>need.</b> It is designed to make the installation, start-up, and operation more user-friendly for novices, and offer greater scientific flexibility to researchers than prior clients. V7 uses Trac for managing its bug tickets so that users can see its development process and provide feedback.|$|E
5|$|Aksel Winther, Bent and Jørgen's handler, {{signals to}} them to kill Elisabeth Lorentzen, Horst Gilbert, and Hermann Seibold–members of the Abwehr, the German {{military}} intelligence service. Bent and Jørgen argue over it as they kill only Danes, to reduce the chance of retaliation by the Nazis. However, Winther claims orders from the government in exile in London. Bent kills Lorentzen but fails to kill Gilbert and Seibold. Later, Jørgen, his wife, Bodil, and their daughter, Ann, celebrate the girl's birthday on their car as they are without money, and Bodil laments over their relationship. Three weeks later, Bent, Jørgen and Whinter meet Spex from the Danish Army Intelligence. He says {{there will be no}} more attacks, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> peace to assemble men for a big attack. The three agree that they should not follow Spex's order, and later Jørgen kills Gilbert. That night, Jørgen robs a grocery store and takes the products to his wife and daughter; however, Bodil announces she is seeing another man.|$|E
25|$|Defensive midfielders {{are central}} midfield players that {{focus more on}} defence than attack. They need {{strength}} to make strong tackles and they also need stamina and some degree of passing skill <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to support other midfielders.|$|E
60|$|As {{the boys}} had both left Ashton in a hurry they had but few things with them. In the Hendricks car they {{traveled}} around Seattle, purchasing such things <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed.</b>|$|R
60|$|Panting for breath, {{for that}} last shock {{had been a}} telling one, the Oak Hall players filed into the dressing-room, there to rest and to receive such {{attention}} <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed.</b>|$|R
50|$|Early in 2013, it was {{reported}} that Iosefa had been offered a contract with the New Zealand Warriors, with the Wests Tigers unwilling to release him <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> a back up for hooker Farah.|$|R
25|$|Immediate or Priority 1 (red) {{evacuation}} by MEDEVAC {{if available}} or ambulance <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> advanced medical care at once or within 1 hour. These {{people are in}} critical condition and would die without immediate assistance.|$|E
25|$|Acuity {{is higher}} among male organisms that mate in mid-air, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> {{to be able}} to spot and assess {{potential}} mates against a very large backdrop. On the other hand, the eyes of organisms which operate in low light levels, such as around dawn and dusk or in deep water, tend to be larger {{to increase the amount of}} light that can be captured.|$|E
25|$|The {{competition}} of entering the medical undergraduate programs is cut-throat {{as the number}} of intake each year is very limited with a quota of 210 from each school (420 in total) and candidates need to attain an excellent examination result and good performance in interview. The schools put a great emphasis on students' languages (both Chinese and English) and communication skills <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to communicate with other health care professionals and patients or their family in the future.|$|E
50|$|Had {{the merger}} gone ahead, these {{arrangements}} could {{still have been}} amended, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> {{to be approved by}} a vote of the remaining clubs; but when the merger was averted, the vote never went ahead.|$|R
50|$|Stoke, last season's runners-up, had a poor League Cup {{campaign}} {{this season}} <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> a replay to beat Shrewsbury Town, then edged past Southend United before losing 3-1 away at Plymouth Argyle in a replay.|$|R
50|$|Entering the playoffs, the Hawks struggled, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> {{the full}} five games {{to get past}} the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference quarterfinals. In the Eastern Conference semifinals, the Hawks were upset by the Indiana Pacers in 6 games.|$|R
25|$|Box to box midfielders {{help with}} almost {{every aspect of}} the game. They need immense stamina <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to cover most areas of the pitch, as well as some degree of passing skills. They would be up one end of the pitch {{assisting}} the attack one moment then back helping to defend around their own penalty area the next. They normally play as central midfielders but any of the midfield players may have this attribute.|$|E
25|$|It {{is later}} {{revealed}} {{due to a}} causal loop, the Colt went {{in the possession of}} Daniel Elkins, the owner of the gun {{at the beginning of the}} series, due to the actions of the Winchesters. When the Winchesters travel to 1861, they meet Samuel Colt, from whom Sam gets the Colt, and Dean uses it to kill a phoenix, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> its ashes. Dean drops the Colt just before being transported back to the present day, where it is presumably retrieved by the saloon owner Elkins, the ancestor of Daniel Elkins.|$|E
25|$|The Passing DLC {{campaign}} {{takes place}} between Dead Center and Dark Carnival, {{and after the}} events of The Sacrifice campaign. The Survivors of L4D2 arrive at the bridge in Rayford, where they meet Francis, Louis, and Zoey. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to cross the bridge to proceed, the Survivors need to find another way across to refill the generator with gas. After fighting {{their way through a}} wedding reception (complete with a Witch bride), the streets, and a historic under-the-river tour, they meet up again with the original Survivors, who help by covering for the group while they fill the generator and lowering the bridge once it's full.|$|E
50|$|In {{the inaugural}} match, O'Higgins played against Lanús {{for the week}} 6 of the 2014 Copa Libertadores. The final result was 0-0,marking the {{elimination}} of the club from the competition, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> a victory to advance to the next round.|$|R
50|$|The single-user BASIC used several {{overlays}} {{to provide}} the full functionality of the language; when OS/8 was booted from a DECtape, a very noticeable delay occurred each time BASIC was required to switch overlays <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> to be read from tape.|$|R
5000|$|As {{most of the}} top {{ports of}} India were {{controlled}} by Europeans, especially the Portuguese, even the Mughals held the Maharaos of Kachchh in high esteem, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> the port of Mandvi for exports, imports and also for pilgrimages to Mecca.|$|R
25|$|Plant {{respiration}} {{is limited}} by the process of diffusion. Plants take in carbon dioxide through holes, known as stomata, that can open and close on the undersides of their leaves and sometimes other parts of their anatomy. Most plants require some oxygen for catabolic processes (break-down reactions that release energy). But the quantity of O2 used per hour is small as they are not involved in activities that require high rates of aerobic metabolism. Their requirement for air, however, is very high <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> CO2 for photosynthesis, which constitutes only 0.04% of the environmental air. Thus, to make 1g of glucose requires the removal of all the CO2 from at least 18.7liters of air at sea level. But inefficiencies in the photosynthetic process cause considerably greater volumes of air to be used.|$|E
25|$|In the {{digestive}} system, the anterior {{region of the}} foregut has been modified to form a pharyngial sucking pump <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> it for the food they eat, which {{are for the most}} part liquids. An esophagus follows and leads to the posterior of the pharynx and in some species forms a form of crop. The midgut is short and straight, with the hindgut being longer and coiled. Ancestors of lepidopteran species, stemming from Hymenoptera, had midgut ceca, although this is lost in current butterflies and moths. Instead, all {{the digestive}} enzymes other than initial digestion, are immobilized at the surface of the midgut cells. In larvae, long-necked and stalked goblet cells are found in the anterior and posterior midgut regions, respectively. In insects, the goblet cells excrete positive potassium ions, which are absorbed from leaves ingested by the larvae. Most butterflies and moths display the usual digestive cycle, however species that have a different diet require adaptations to meet these new demands.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{allegations}} and court cases of police brutality, custodial death, human rights violations, fake encounter killing, extortion, filing fake cases to harass the general public, corruption {{filed against the}} Assam Police.Because of the corrupt politicians the police have always complained {{not being able to}} function properly.Different organizations and their open extortion are known to the public and the police also have been alleged to have a fair share on those.Another main acquisition of Assam police in the present is that they are the friends of thieves, kidnappers and murderers rather than the public and it is said that the police has a better share in those crime money.Corruption of the organization is at peak with people fearing to go to the police against a crime <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to pay money to file an FIR or take actions.As a victim says,"I lost my bicycle as few days back and had reported the case in the station.They called me that they had found it and asked 1000 rupees for the release.I took a new one in 1600". In fact it is said that the police waits for the crime to happen so that they can make a profit out of it.Therefore, citizens there take the law in their own hands.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2011-12 season, Umunegbu signed for Chiasso on a free transfer, but during the January transfer window he came back to Milan <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> a player to fill in their second non-EU spot, which otherwise would have been lost.|$|R
50|$|During {{his life}} Joel Goldsmith asked for no {{remuneration}} for his healing work {{but he did}} take it if offered. He also {{did not participate in}} overt advertisement of his books and tapes, knowing instead that people would find them <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> them.|$|R
50|$|Bari {{was active}} in the Washington, DC community. In the early 1970s, Bari used a grant from the National Science Foundation to start a master's degree program in {{teaching}} mathematics.

500|$|T.chatareus are {{distributed}} throughout southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific and Australia. They may live in brackish or fresh water, inhabiting mangrove swamps and estuaries {{as well as}} further upstream in slow-moving rivers. While occasionally caught and eaten, T.chatareus are more commonly kept in the aquarium. They may be sold with other Toxotidae under the collective label [...] "archerfish". Caring for T.chatareus in aquaria is somewhat difficult <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> live food given at the surface, rather than flake food.|$|E

500|$|The album {{consists}} of 22 songs, {{most of which}} are short, under 3 minutes, and contain no hooks or choruses. Sam Samuelson of AllMusic compared the album to a comic book, [...] "sometimes segued with vignettes sampled from 1940s movies and broadcasts or left-field -toting skits". He also noted that some instrumentals on the album [...] " [...] to be so out of time or step with a traditional hip-hop direction". The A.V. Club compared the album to a buffet, where [...] "Madlib and Doom are interested in throwing out ideas as fast as they have them, giving them as much attention <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>need,</b> and {{moving on to the next}} thing". Tim O'Neil of PopMatters praised Madlib's instrumentals and said that they [...] "make the album a sonic feast".|$|E

500|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoos}} begin breeding {{from four}} {{years of age and}} mate for life. Mature wandoo and salmon gum woodlands provide important breeding habitat for the cockatoos <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> large hollows in tall trees. The nests are generally located about [...] above the ground, and spaced [...] away from each other, on average. There is competition for nest hollows with western corellas (Cacatua pastinator), galahs (Eolophus roseicapilla), and feral honeybees (Apis mellifera). Galahs seek out hollows at any time of year, unlike the Carnaby's black cockatoos, which only look before breeding. Mated pairs return to a breeding locale in late winter and begin preparing to breed, the female choosing a suitable hollow in a tree. She becomes highly territorial, driving off other females from the vicinity of the nest. After a bushfire burnt out much of the species' breeding habitat in 2009, local wildlife officers of the Department of Parks and Wildlife in Western Australia constructed artificial breeding hollows. After some experimentation by authorities, the survival rate of nestlings in these hollows increased to 75%.|$|E

This element is particularly substantial: holding the presidency may be, on balance, a disadvantage for member states.|$|E
