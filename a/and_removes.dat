5|$|In 2007 DragonFly BSD {{received}} a new device file system (devfs), which dynamically adds <b>and</b> <b>removes</b> device nodes, allows accessing devices by connection paths, recognises drives by serial numbers <b>and</b> <b>removes</b> {{the need for}} pre-populated /dev file system hierarchy. It was implemented as a Google Summer of Code 2009 project.|$|E
5|$|The body {{interacts with}} nature, <b>and</b> <b>removes</b> liquids and excretes waste through nine holes. The aim of pranayama (breath control) is to purify the {{channels}} and nourish the inner body with vital airs. This benefits a yogi and yogini in preventing and curing diseases, {{as well as}} preparing the mind for meditation.|$|E
5|$|A new, {{redesigned}} MacBook {{line was}} launched on March 9, 2015.

It also features a Retina display. On April 19, 2016, Apple updated the 12-inch Retina MacBook with new sixth-generation Intel Core M processors, longer battery life and a rose gold option.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} logic with the dynamic modal {{operators}} copy <b>and</b> <b>remove.</b> The copy operator replicates a given model, <b>and</b> the <b>remove</b> operator removes paths {{in a given}} model. We show that the product update by an action model (with Boolean pre-conditions) in dynamic epistemic logic decomposes in copy <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> operations. We also show that copy <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> operators (of path of length 1) can be expressed by action models. We investigate {{the complexity of the}} satisfiability problem of syntactic fragments of the logic with copy <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> operations...|$|R
25|$|This {{behavior}} can be axiomatized in various ways. For example, a common VDM (Vienna Development Method) description of a stack defines top (peek) <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> as atomic, where top returns the top value (without modifying the stack), <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> modifies the stack (without returning a value). In this case pop is {{defined in terms of}} top <b>and</b> <b>remove.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} logic with the dynamic modal {{operators}} copy <b>and</b> <b>remove.</b> The copy operator replicates a given model, <b>and</b> the <b>remove</b> operator removes paths {{in a given}} model. We show that the product update by an action model in dynamic epistemic logic decomposes in copy <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> operations, when we consider action models with Boolean pre-conditions and no post-condition. We also show that copy <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> operators with paths of length 1 can be ex-pressed by action models with post-conditions. We investigate the expressive power of the logic with copy <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> operations, together with the complex-ity of the satisfiability problem {{of some of its}} syntactic fragments...|$|R
5|$|In 1964, the fort's ditch {{became a}} tank {{cleaning}} farm for the Malta Drydocks. The depot, {{which is known}} as Ricasoli Tank Cleaning Facilities, treats liquid waste from ships arriving in the Grand Harbour <b>and</b> <b>removes</b> oil and other chemicals prior to releasing the waste into the sea. The facility was privatized in 2012, and it is currently under the management of Waste Oils Co. Ltd.|$|E
5|$|Phillip Padgett (John Hawkes), {{a fledgling}} author, {{sits at a}} desk, {{suffering}} from writer's block. He eventually retires {{to the bathroom to}} discard a spent cigarette. Without warning or concern, the man suddenly reaches into his chest <b>and</b> <b>removes</b> a bloody heart. Later, he walks down metal stairs into a cluttered basement, and opens the door of an incinerator. Noticing a beating heart amidst the flames, and unfazed by the vision, he nonchalantly tosses in a paper bag.|$|E
5|$|The Girl Strike Leader is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film deals with labor relations when Hal Stephens disguises himself and works in a factory he was given by his father. As a laborer, he {{falls in love with}} a young working girl named Lou and protects her against a manager. Lou leads a strike when wages are ordered to be cut by 10%, but the strikers return to work on the verge of starvation. Lou, who resists, is saved by Hal who assumes control, restores the wages <b>and</b> <b>removes</b> the previous manager.|$|E
50|$|Powderhall {{also has}} one of the city's main waste {{management}} depots. Originally built as an incinerator, ironically a new chimney on the plant was condemned in the 1990s <b>and</b> <b>removed.</b> Waste is now brought in by road <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> by rail.|$|R

40|$|The {{hygienic}} {{behavior of}} honey bees {{is based on}} a two-step process, including uncapping <b>and</b> <b>removing</b> diseased, dead, damaged, or parasitized brood inside the cell. We evaluated during periods of 1 h the time that hygienic and non-hygienic colonies of Africanized honey bees spend to detect, uncap <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> pin-killed brood using comb inserts with transparent walls placed in observation hives. We observed that hygienic colonies are significantly faster in detecting, uncapping <b>and</b> <b>removing</b> dead brood in the cells (P < 0. 001) ...|$|R

5|$|The {{seeds of}} conifers, {{the largest group}} of gymnosperms, are {{enclosed}} in a cone and most species have seeds that are light and papery that can be blown considerable distances once free from the cone. Sometimes the seed remains in the cone for years waiting for a trigger event to liberate it. Fire stimulates release and germination of seeds of the jack pine, and also enriches the forest floor with wood ash <b>and</b> <b>removes</b> competing vegetation. Similarly, a number of angiosperms including Acacia cyclops and Acacia mangium have seeds that germinate better after exposure to high temperatures.|$|E
5|$|As is {{the case}} for most Brazilian {{football}} clubs, Atlético Mineiro's by-law defines the club as a not-for-profit public utility organization, formed by associates (sócios). The club's administrative powers are the General Assembly, the Deliberative Council, the Board, the Fiscal Council and the Ethics and Discipline Council. The General Assembly, composed of all associates, elects the Deliberative Council among its members every three years, which in turn elects <b>and</b> <b>removes</b> the club's Board, responsible for the executive management of the club. Season ticket-holders and participants of the Galo na Veia affiliation programme, called sócios-torcedores, are not full club associates and cannot vote or be elected.|$|E

25|$|Slag {{may also}} form during smithing and refining. The {{product of the}} bloomer process is {{heterogeneous}} blooms of entrapped slag. Smithing is necessary to cut up <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> the trapped slag by reheating, softening the slag and then squeezing it out. On the other hand, refining is needed for the cast iron produced in the blast furnace. By re-melting the cast iron in an open hearth, the carbon is oxidized <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> from the iron. Liquid slag is formed <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> in this process.|$|R
5|$|Christine, now {{pregnant}} and married, awakens on a May bank holiday. Thirteen months later, it is Father's Day and Adam tends to their son Jack (played variously by Joel Little and Dexter Little) in the night. Christine hears the Stranger's voice, but eventually finds Jack with Adam. Christine celebrates her birthday thirteen months later. Ernie no longer recognises Christine, while Adam {{is more interested}} in his colleague Zara (Ellerby). Marion blindfolds Christine for a game of blind man's buff. Christine hears noises from behind a door <b>and</b> <b>removes</b> her blindfold to step through. Thirteen months later, Adam is packing a case for a family holiday. Ernie has died, and Christine's relationship with Adam is strained.|$|E
5|$|Consolidated Edison {{provides}} {{electric power}} {{and natural gas}} to the village, and the Briarcliff Manor Department of Public Works supplies water from the Catskill Aqueduct to the village's water system. The department also maintains the sewer system, village vehicles, roads, and grounds, operates a recycling center, <b>and</b> <b>removes</b> snow. In 2012 the village tied for fourth place (out of 48 Westchester municipalities) {{in the percentage of}} recycled waste (71percent, above the county average of 52percent). The department, primarily rooted in the 1941 sale of Walter Law's Briarcliff Table Water Company, began with a state-mandated street commissioner. The commissioner in 1914 was Arthur Brown; asked by village officials if he needed an automobile, Brown replied that he preferred a horse but would use an automobile if the village purchased it (it did not). The department has about thirty vehicles and employs twenty-nine people.|$|E

Later, Pfaster—having been hired as a frozen food delivery man through charming the female interviewer—delivers to a low-security house {{of a woman with}} teenage daughters. He requests the bathroom to wash his hands, and whilst there steals some discarded hair from a brush he found in the trashcan. Pfaster attends a night class at a community college, where a female classmate defends herself after he makes threatening advances. He is arrested and is placed in a jail cell across from a suspect being interrogated for Pfaster's crimes by Mulder, Scully, and Bocks. Pfaster shows interest in Scully, and learns her name from the interrogated suspect. Pfaster is later released as his charges were dropped.|$|E

With his powers restored, Castiel helps Claire find her long-lost mother, but although Amelia sacrifices herself to save Claire, Claire accepts that the Winchesters and Castiel meant well, even speculating that she will become a Hunter herself. When Rowena – Crowley's long-lost mother – casts a spell to remove the Mark, she also casts a spell that causes Castiel to attack Crowley while she escapes, leaving Castiel driven by a greater rage to the point that he kills two angels until Rowena is forced to cure him.|$|E
5|$|The {{kingdom of}} Etruria {{contacts}} Roy and assigns his army {{to travel to}} the Western Isles, where heavy bandit activity is being reported.
