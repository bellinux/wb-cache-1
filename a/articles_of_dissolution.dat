Some failing companies are purchased by a new owner who may be able to run the company better, and some are merged with another company that will then take over its operations. Some businesses save themselves through bankruptcy or bankruptcy protection, thereby allowing themselves to restructure. There are several consequences towards the owners/shareholders, such as limited liability, the finance and the continuity (if a shareholder does not want to continue in the business).|$|E
6000|$|August 26.--The vale {{behind the}} village, {{narrowing}} swiftly {{to a mere}} ravine, was choked with profitable trees. A river gushed in the midst. Overhead, the tall coco-palms made a primary covering; above that, from one wall of the mountain to another, the ravine was roofed with cloud; so that we moved below, amid teeming vegetation, in a covered house of heat. On either hand, at every hundred yards, instead of the houseless, disembowelling paepaes of Nuka-hiva, populous houses turned out their inhabitants to cry [...] "Kaoha!" [...] to the passers-by. The road, too, was busy: strings of girls, fair and foul, as in less favoured countries; men bearing breadfruit; the sisters, with a little guard of pupils; a fellow bestriding a horse--passed and greeted us continually; {{and now it was}} a Chinaman who came to the gate of his flower-yard, and gave us [...] "Good-day" [...] in excellent English; and a little farther on it would be some natives who set us down by the wayside, made us a feast of mummy-apple, and entertained us as we ate with drumming on a tin case. With all this fine plenty of men and fruit, death is at work here also. The population, according to the highest estimate, does not exceed six hundred in the whole vale of Atuona; and yet, when I once chanced to put the question, Brother Michel counted up ten whom he knew to be sick beyond recovery.

40|$|Abstract—The <b>dissolution</b> <b>of</b> pyrite is {{important}} in the geochemical cycling of iron and sulphur, in the formation of acid mine drainage, and in the extraction of metals by bacterial leaching. Many researchers have studied the kinetics <b>of</b> <b>dissolution,</b> and the rate <b>of</b> <b>dissolution</b> has often been found to be half-order in ferric ions or oxygen. Previous work has not adequately explained the kinetics <b>of</b> <b>dissolution</b> <b>of</b> pyrite. The <b>dissolution</b> <b>of</b> pyrite is an oxidation-reduction reaction. The kinetics of the oxidation and reduction half-reactions was studied independently using electrochemical techniques of voltammetry. The kinetics of the overall reaction was studied by the electrochemical technique of potentiometry, which consisted of measuring the mixed potential of a sample of corroding pyrite in solutions of different compositions. The kinetics of the half reactions are related to the kinetics <b>of</b> the overall <b>dissolution</b> reaction by the condition that there is no accumulation of charge. This principle is used to derive expressions for the mixed potential and the rate <b>of</b> <b>dissolution,</b> which successfully describe the mixed potential measurements and the kinetics <b>of</b> <b>dissolution</b> reported in the literature. It is shown that the observations of half-order kinetics and that the oxygen in the sulphate product arises from water are both a direct consequence of the electrochemical mechanism. Thus it is concluded that the electrochemical reaction steps occurring at the mineral-solution interface control the rate <b>of</b> <b>dissolution.</b> Raman spectroscopy was used to analyze reaction products formed on the pyrite surface.

40|$|Measurements <b>of</b> rates <b>of</b> <b>dissolution</b> <b>of</b> typical {{insulation}} wool fibers (glasswool and basalt based stonewool) and {{an experimental}} fiber were made using a flow-through equipment. The liquids used were a modified Gamble's solution, adjusted to pH 4. 8 and 7. 7 ± 0. 2, respectively. The <b>dissolution</b> <b>of</b> SiO 2 and CaO was determined over periods {{of up to}} three months. The rate <b>of</b> <b>dissolution</b> <b>of</b> stonewool fibers was {{lower than that of}} glasswool fibers at pH 7. 7, whereas the opposite was true at pH 4. 8. The stonewool fibers dissolve congruently, but glasswool fibers tend to dissolve with leaching. The rates <b>of</b> <b>dissolution</b> <b>of</b> fibers of different compositions, including insulation wool (glasswool, basalt-based stonewool, slagwool) and experimental fibers were screened using a stationary set-up.

40|$|Galvanic {{interactions}} between gold and associated substances are amongst the many {{factors that could}} influence the rate <b>of</b> <b>dissolution</b> <b>of</b> gold in a cyanide or an acidic thiourea solution. Some of these galvanic influences were investigated here by short-circuiting two rotating disc electrodes either in the same container or in two separate containers linked by a salt bridge. In a cyanide solution it was established that the largest decrease in the rate <b>of</b> gold <b>dissolution</b> was obtained when gold was in contact with copper, chalcopyrite and pyrite in the same container. On the other hand, in an acidic thiourea solution, chalcopyrite and pyrite increased the rate <b>of</b> <b>dissolution</b> when both electrodes {{were in the same}} container. This was ascribed to sulphur species in solution that inhibited the degradation of thiourea to formamidine disulphide, one of the by-products <b>of</b> the <b>dissolution</b> <b>of</b> gold in thiourea. Galena produced a very marked increase in the rate <b>of</b> <b>dissolution</b> <b>of</b> gold in cyanide solutions when both electrodes were in the same container. This could be ascribed to the action of Pb(II) ions {{on the surface of the}} gold. However, galena had little or no effect on the rate <b>of</b> <b>dissolution</b> <b>of</b> gold when in the same container in an acidic thiourea medium. © 1990. Articl...|$|R
