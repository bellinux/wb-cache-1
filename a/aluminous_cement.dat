40|$|EN]Some {{degradation}} {{processes in}} <b>aluminous</b> <b>cement</b> concretes {{are related to}} the presence of alkalis contained in aggregates or other external sources. Carbonation of <b>aluminous</b> <b>cement</b> in the presence of alkalis is sometimes called ‘alkaline hydrolysis’ and has been described by some authors as a catalytic-like process which leads to the total destruction of the affected element (concrete). The minimum parameters required for this hypothetical alkaline hydrolysis to occur have been established. However, despite several attempts made in specialized laboratories, the process has not yet been proven. The role played by K+, in particular, is still unknown. This paper attempts to investigate the hydration process of <b>aluminous</b> <b>cement</b> in the presence of high concentrations of K+ (1 and 3 M).

50|$|C12A7 is an {{important}} mineral phase in calcium aluminate cements and is an intermediate {{in the manufacture of}} Portland cement. It reacts rapidly with water, with considerable heat evolution, to form 3CaO·Al2O3·6H2O and Al(OH)3 gel. The formation of the hydrate from this mineral and from monocalcium aluminate represents the first stage of strength development in <b>aluminous</b> <b>cements.</b> Because of its higher reactivity, leading to excessively rapid hydration, <b>aluminous</b> <b>cements</b> contain relatively low amounts of dodecacalcium hepta-aluminate, or none at all.|$|R

Independently of the dolomite type used, a mixed phase product consisting of spinel accompanied by CA and CA 2 is obtained. The content of CA phase in the cement composition is decreased with increasing of Al 2 O 3 in the raw materials composition.

40|$|Hydraulic binders play a {{vital role}} in the {{economic}} and social development because they are essential components of concrete, the most widely used construction material. Nowadays, Portland cement is the most predominantly used hydraulic binder due to its properties and widespread availability. Cement manufacture consumes large amount of non-renewable raw materials and energy, and it is a carbon-intensive process. Many efforts are, therefore, being undertaken towards the developing “greener” hydraulic binders. Concomitantly, binders must also correspond to market demand in terms of performance and aesthetic as well as fulfill mandatory regulations. In order to pursue these goals, different approaches have been followed including the improvement of the cement manufacturing process, production of blended cements, and testing innovative hydraulic binders with a different chemistry. This chapter presents a brief history of hydraulic binder’s discovery and use as well as the environmental and economic context of cement industry. It, then, describes the chemistry and properties of currently most used hydraulic binders—common cements and hydraulic limes—and that of the more promising binders for future applications, namely special Portland <b>cements,</b> <b>aluminous</b> <b>cements,</b> calcium sulfoaluminate cements, and alkali-activated cements...|$|R
40|$|Refractory lining materials, {{which include}} ceramic {{refractories}} and nonfired heat-resistant concretes, {{have a very}} short lifespan during the turnaround time measured in years and sometimes months. Therefore, increasing the service life of thermal generating units by 1. 5 - 2 times will bring significant economic benefits. The main factor that determines the durability of refractory lining materials is the thermal resistance. It is possible to increase the thermal resistance by improving such physical and mechanical properties as strength and density. As for the ceramic refractory performance improvement, such technological methods as their structural and chemical modification by phosphate binder impregnation, as well as introduction of phosphate components into the ceramic batches during the molding process increase, in particular, their thermal stability. The use of <b>aluminous</b> and high-alumina <b>cements</b> contributes to a significant increase of not only strength, but also physical and thermal performance of heat-resistant concretes with different fillers.

This paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} an experimental program aimed at investigating of the mechanical properties of composites based on <b>aluminous</b> <b>cement</b> for high-temperature applications and deal with the influence of high-thermal loading on polycarboxylate superplasticizing (PCSP) additive contained in the composite.

Silica composites based on Portland cement and silica aggregates are not able to resist the effects of high-temperatures [1]. For high-temperature composites was therefore used <b>aluminous</b> <b>cement</b> Secar® 71 (Lafarge S. A.) in combination with crushed basalt aggregates of fraction 0 / 4 and 2 / 5 mm.

The results showed that nano-Cr 2 O 3 addition has effect on the increasing of spinel and CA 2 and decreasing of CA and C 12 A 7 phases in the cement composition. The decreasing of C 12 A 7 leads to increasing of setting times of cement.

The binder system based on <b>aluminous</b> <b>cement</b> was modified by adding finely-ground ceramic powder and metakaolin to reduce costs and also to reduce adverse effects on the environment due to high energy consumption for cement production. Additives were applied as a partial <b>aluminous</b> <b>cement</b> replacement in doses of 10, 20 and 30 % by weight. The composites were evaluated {{on the basis of their}} mechanical properties and their bulk density after gradual temperature loading. The influence of basalt fibers and modifications to the binder system were studied at the same time. Basalt fibers were applied in doses of 0. 5 % and 2. 0 % by volume.

The addition of ceramic powder reduced the bulk density by 5 % for each 10 % of cement substitution, but the residual values were very similar. The bulk density and the compressive strength were reduced when basalt fibers were applied, and the flexural strength was significantly increased in proportion to the fiber dosages. Metakaolin seems to be a more suitable additive than the ceramic powder that was applied here, because there was a significant increase in the mechanical parameters and also in the residual values of all properties that were studied...|$|E

The effect of several dispersants has been studied. The optimum dispersion, associated with the minimum viscosity, is obtained with minimal amounts of dispersant in the case of acetic and propionic acids. Indeed, the corresponding quantities of dispersant are less than 0. 5 % by weight relative to cement. In addition to its dispersive role, acetic acid plays a role in the setting. It has a retarding effect below 1 % by weight relative to the mass of cement and from this amount, it plays an accelerating role on setting. Tapes prepared with cement, water, acetic acid, PEG 300 have been left to set in different environments at 20 ◦C (50 % or 95 % relative humidity, water).

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the effect of sodium citrate on the {{formation}} of a cement stone in the aluminous binder. Formation of cement stone framework in cement hydraulic binder is accompanied with complicated physical and chemical processes of interphase interactions and dispersion, these processes are predicated on qualitative and quantitative composition of the cement mortar, continuous changes in its properties from preparation stage till curing. Addition of sodium citrate to tempering water enhances hydration of both Portland cement and calcium aluminate cement. Process pertaining to an increase of cement hydration rate is considered as a consequence of destruction in surface formations and exclusion of damping effect in respect of hydration rate and hydrolysis of products resulted from interaction of clinker material with tempering. It has been established that sodium citrate makes it possible to control processes of hydration, hydrolysis, binding and curing for cement mass. High degree of hydration of <b>aluminous</b> <b>cement</b> in the presence of sodium citrate provides fast binding and curing of binder, low porosity and rather high compression breaking strength of cement stone for all curing stages. An increase in concentration of sodium citrate in cement mixture up to 10 % of the cement mass exerts an influence not only on the process of cement mortar liquefaction, reduction of time for cement mass setting and hardening but also increases compression strength of cement stone.
