40|$|A {{study has}} been made of {{possible}} ways to improve the performance of the Langley Research Center's Transonic Dynamics Tunnel (TDT). The major effort was directed toward obtaining increased dynamic pressure in the Mach number range from 0. 8 to 1. 2, but methods to increase Mach number capability were also considered. Methods studied for increasing dynamic pressure capability were higher total pressure, <b>auxiliary</b> <b>suction,</b> reducing circuit losses, reduced test medium temperature, smaller test section and higher molecular weight test medium. Increased Mach number methods investigated were nozzle block inserts, variable geometry nozzle, changes in test section wall configuration, and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>suction...</b>|$|E
40|$|High-altitude {{simulator}} {{reduced power}} requirements. Test cell uses its exhaust-capture duct only to remove gases from engine; cooling air evacuated through separate path by <b>auxiliary</b> <b>suction</b> system. This way, capture duct cross-sectional area kept close to exhaust jet area, leading to greatly improved recovery performance...|$|E
40|$|A new exhaust {{diffuser}} concept for jet engine altitude test cells which greatly reduces operating power and cost requirements for exhausters is discussed. The concept utilizes the capture duct as an efficient diffuser only, while evacuating the secondary air via a separate path using an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>suction</b> system. Implementation {{of the concept}} would reduce the peak exhauster power requirement during a TF- 30 altitude test by 48 percent and the overall exhaust power cost of the test program by 41 percent. The design accommodates various engine sizes and can achieve optimum pressure recovery performance during both A/B and IRP modes of engine operation. The pressure recovery performance of the proposed {{exhaust diffuser}}s does not deteriorate with increasing cooling air fraction. The disadvantages of the proposed scheme are: increased mechanical complexity of the extended variable geometry diffuser duct {{and the need for}} an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>suction</b> system for evacuating cell-cooling air...|$|E
40|$|A {{dynamic model}} of the National Transonic Facility (NTF) section and plenum chamber was developed. The model serves {{as a means for}} {{determining}} the dynamic performance of the NTF and the subsequent design of optimal control configurations, and is of one dimensional flow type as to facilitate computer simulation. The model allows for the simulation of the effects of test section blockage, boundary layer losses, slot flow required for supersonic flow generation, reentry flap position, and <b>auxiliary</b> plenum <b>suction...</b>|$|R
40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{different types}} of two-stroke engines {{as well as the}} three most important design factors: volume of scavenge and charge delivery, scavenging process (scavenging result), and result of charge. Some of the types of engines discussed include: single cylinder with crank-chamber scavenge pump and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>suction</b> piston linked to working connecting rod; and two cylinder engines with a rotary scavenge pump arrangement. Three and four cylinder engines are also discussed in various designs...|$|E
40|$|The Calspan self-correcting {{wind tunnel}} is a {{two-dimensional}} facility {{in which the}} flow field {{in the vicinity of}} the walls is actively controlled, and a theoretical evaluation is used in conjunction with flow field measurements to confirm that wall interference was minimized. The facility is described, and the results of experiments with a 6 percent-blockage model are presented to show that iterative application of wall control effectively eliminates the interference. Experiments were performed at conditions where the flow at the walls was supercritical, and a new operating procedure is described for these conditions. The results of an analysis of the flow in the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>suction</b> system and test ion illustrate the tradeoffs available in the design of self-correcting wind tunnel test sections and in model sizing for such tunnels...|$|E
40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} for the calibration of the 2 quot; x 10 quot; Induction Tunnel. The set-up for plenum chamber suction was completed and tried {{out for the first}} time. Results of calibration tests are presented along with {{a brief description of the}} various components of the tunnel. 13; The results show that test section Mach numbers upto 0. 92 can be obtained with the operation of main injector, and Mach number distribution in the test section between station 1 and 15 is within 4 -. 005 for a wall divergence angle 6 w= 1. 25 xB 0;. With <b>auxiliary</b> <b>suction,</b> Mach numbers upto 1. 18 are obtained in the test section; for this range, the maximum variation from the mean Mach number is _+. 01 between statiors 3 and 13 in the test section. The boundary layer thickness on each of the side walls at the test section is about 10 % of the span, for all Mach numbers...|$|E
40|$|Summary. -The {{use of an}} {{auxiliary}} slot on a laminar-flow aerofoil has been investigated to check whether laminar flow can be re-established by suction {{at the rear of}} the region of deposited dirt, flies, etc. Results indicate that in the absence of unfavourable pressure gradients, it is possible to re-establish a laminar boundary layer by removing a little more than the whole turbulent layer reaching the slot, and preliminary estimates suggest that with efficient ducting it should be possible to achieve a reduction in overall effective drag coefficient by this means. 1. I ntroduction. -The successful use of all low-drag wings, and of thick suction wings in particular, depends on maintaining a laminar boundary layer over a large proportion of the wing surface. This can be achieved readily in the wind tunnel and in test flights if suitable precautions are taken, but in service the chief difficulty is the tendency of the wing to collect dirt and flies on the nose, thus establishing transition to turbulent flow. Since flight tests have shown that the affected region of the wing is usually confined to a few per cent of the chord, it was decided at the National Physical Laboratory to investigate whether laminar flow could be re-established behind this region by the use of an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>suction</b> slot...|$|E
