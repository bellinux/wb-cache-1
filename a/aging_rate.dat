40|$|Utility asset {{managers}} and engineers {{are concerned about}} the life and reliability of their power transformers which depends on the continued life of the paper insulation. The <b>ageing</b> <b>rate</b> of the paper is affected by water, oxygen and acids. Traditionally, the <b>ageing</b> <b>rate</b> of paper has been studied in sealed vessels however this approach does not allow the possibility to assess the affect of oxygen on paper with different water content. The <b>ageing</b> <b>rate</b> of paper has been studied for dry paper in air (excess oxygen). In these experiments we studied the <b>ageing</b> <b>rate</b> of Kraft and thermally upgraded Kraft paper in medium and high oxygen with varying water content. Furthermore, the oxygen content of the oil in sealed vessels is low which represents only sealed transformers. The <b>ageing</b> <b>rate</b> of the paper has not been determined for free breathing transformers with medium or high oxygen content and for different wetness of paper. In these ageing experiments the water and oxygen content was controlled using a special test rig to compare the <b>ageing</b> <b>rate</b> to previous work and to determine the ageing effect of paper by combining temperature, water content of paper and oxygen content of the oil. We found that the <b>ageing</b> <b>rate</b> of paper with the same water content increased with oxygen content in the oil.

40|$|This {{study shows}} that {{characterization}} of the molecular mobility in the cytoplasm of pollen provides {{a new understanding of}} the effects of moisture and temperature on <b>ageing</b> <b>rates.</b> Using EPR spectroscopy, we determined the rotational motion of the polar spin probe, 3 -carboxy-proxyl, in the cytoplasm of Typha latifolia pollen, under different temperature and moisture content conditions. Increasing the temperature resulted in faster rotational motion, analogous to faster <b>ageing</b> <b>rates.</b> With decreasing moisture content, rotational motion first decreased until a minimum was reached, after which rotational motion slightly increased again. The moisture content at which this minimal rotational motion was observed increased with decreasing temperature, comparable to the pattern of <b>ageing</b> <b>rate.</b> A significant linear relationship was found between <b>ageing</b> <b>rates</b> and rotational motion in the cytoplasm, suggesting that these parameters are causally linked. Upon melting of the intracellular glass, a twofold increase in activation energy of rotational motion and <b>ageing</b> <b>rate</b> was observed. In contrast, melting of the sucrose glass resulted in an increase in rotational motion of five orders of magnitude. The difference in rotational motion upon melting glasses of pollen or sucrose suggests that other molecules beside sugars play a role in intracellular glass formation in pollen...|$|R
