40|$|Forty eight {{strains of}} Pseudomonas glumae were {{tested for the}} {{antibiosis}} against 7 species of phytopathogenic bacteria, Agrobactetium tumefaciens, Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis, Xanthomonas campestris pv. citri, X. campestris pv. oryzae, Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, P. solanacearmm, P. syn’ngae pv. syn’ngae. The productivity was tested using the plate chloroform method. All strains of P. glumae {{used in this study}} produced <b>antibacterial</b> <b>substances</b> against, at least, one indicator. The exudate from the culture plate obtained through freezing and thawing showed antibiotics against phytopathogenic bacteria used as indicators. While, no production of the <b>antibacterial</b> <b>substances</b> was observed in the various liquid media. However in the agar-extract amended liquid medium, <b>antibacterial</b> <b>substances</b> were produced. These results indicated that water-soluble nutrients from agar will be necessary for the production of <b>antibacterial</b> <b>substances.</b> The <b>antibacterial</b> <b>substances</b> produced byP. glumue were dialyzable, heat labile and stable to trypsin, pronase, DNase, RNase treatments and UV irradiation...|$|R
30|$|Media {{play a very}} {{important}} role in the successful isolation of lactic acid bacteria and in maximizing the production of <b>antibacterial</b> <b>substances</b> from LAB. In the present context, strain LAP 1 produced the maximum amount of inhibitory components in MRS medium. Our study favours earlier reports, which suggested that MRS medium was a better medium for the growth of probiotic bacteria and the production of <b>antibacterial</b> <b>substances</b> (Yang et al. 2012; Ten Brink et al. 1994). The low production of <b>antibacterial</b> <b>substances</b> recorded in other media suggests that the high yield of growth inhibitory components from the isolate depends upon the specific nutrients supplied in the medium for biomass production.|$|R

50|$|In 1928, Sir Alexander Fleming {{identified}} penicillin, {{a molecule}} produced by certain molds that kills or stops {{the growth of}} certain kinds of bacteria. Fleming {{was working on a}} culture of disease-causing bacteria when he noticed the spores of a green mold, Penicillium chrysogenum, in one of his culture plates. He observed that the presence of the mold killed or prevented the growth of the bacteria. Fleming postulated that the mold must secrete an <b>antibacterial</b> <b>substance,</b> which he named penicillin in 1928. Fleming believed that its antibacterial properties could be exploited for chemotherapy. He initially characterized some of its biological properties, and attempted to use a crude preparation to treat some infections, but he was unable to pursue its further development without the aid of trained chemists.|$|E

30|$|MRS medium {{supplemented}} with Tween 20 induced {{the synthesis of}} antagonistic substances (Castro et al. 2011), as was also shown in the present study. The increased production by strain LAP 1 {{in the presence of}} Tween 20 in MRS broth might be because Tween 20 is a non-ionic surfactant agent, and hence it has the ability to overproduce growth inhibitory components by affecting the bacterial cell membrane and secreting <b>antibacterial</b> <b>substances</b> directly into the medium.

Rahnella aquatilis strain HX 2 {{has the ability}} to promote maize growth and {{suppress}} sunflower crown gall disease caused by Agrobacterium vitis, A. tumefaciens, and A. rhizogenes. Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a cofactor of aldose and alcohol dehydrogenases, is required for the synthesis of an <b>antibacterial</b> <b>substance,</b> gluconic acid, by HX 2. Mutants of HX 2 unable to produce PQQ were obtained by in-frame deletion of either the pqqA or pqqB gene.

Interestingly, both the pqqA and pqqB mutants of R. aquatilis eliminated the ability of strain HX 2 to produce <b>antibacterial</b> <b>substance,</b> which in turn, reduced the effectiveness of the strain for biological control of sunflower crown gall disease. The mutation also resulted in decreased mineral phosphate solubilization by HX 2, which reduced the efficacy of this strain as a biological fertilizer.

Vibrio sp. strain OCN 008 was isolated from Porites compressa, another common species of coral in Kaneohe Bay, and was shown to inhibit the growth of three putative pathogens isolated from the coral mucus of MWS-affected M. capitata. OCN 008 exhibited inhibitory activity on agar plate tests, including soft-agar overlay assays, culture droptests, and supernatant droptests.

They are also impaired in producing pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) or glucose dehydrogenase (GDH). Complementation of MH 15 and MH 16 with cosmid clones of CP 465 and CP 104 from an HX 2 DNA library restored the antibiosis, biocontrol, and PQQ or GDH production phenotypes. A 6. 7 -kb BamHI fragment from CP 465 that fully restored the MH 15 -affected phenotypes was cloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis of the mutated DNA region resulted in the identification of seven open reading frames (ORFs), six of which share significant homology with PQQ-synthesizing genes in other bacteria, designated pqqA through pqqF. Meanwhile, A 5. 5 -kb PstI fragment from CP 104 fully complemented the MH 16 mutant and contained a single ORF highly similar to that of genes coding for GDHs.
