Phushi Devi wife of Chaudhary Dile Ram Janghu, who started to reside here in the 1870s the incident is said to have occurred as follows. After a few years (about 1865 or so) for the land settlement of the region, the ruler of the then Native State of Jind is said to have visited this area. On his initiation, the headmen of both the Khordia and <b>Atelia</b> families got together and agreed to settle[...] at the present site after the issue of their possession of cultivable land and habitation site had been settled. the same was done by earmarking a dividing line starting from east to west; thus <b>Atelia</b> mohalla or panna on the northern side and Khordia mohalla or Panna came to be settled in south of this area. This division in two parts of the village remains even today.|$|E

O objetivo consistiu na investigaÃÃo da concepÃÃo dos docentes da linguagem do ensino de Artes Visuais sobre experimentos artÃsticos e estÃticos e da avaliaÃÃo dessas prÃticas, com vistas a redimensionar saberes e fazeres em suas aÃÃes pedagÃgicas. A fundamentaÃÃo teÃrica desta tese atribui que o objeto de estudo Ã de natureza ontolÃgica, o qual solicita a abordagem fenomenolÃgica, tendo a arte como elemento originÃrio o seu autor (HEIDEGGER, 2003, 2005, 2010, 2011) e a desconstruÃÃo como meio de desabrochar a arte (DERRIDA, 2002). A visÃo de ensino de Arte ContemporÃnea se faz presente, despontando a concepÃÃo de que Arte e vida se aproximam (BARBIERI, 2009; COHN, 2013; KONESKI, 2009; LEDUR, 2012; TESCH; VERGARA, 2012). A metodologia adotada foi a pesquisa educacional fenomenolÃgica e ocorreu a partir dos conceitos e definiÃÃes do pensamento de Heidegger e Merleau-Ponty (1999, 2009). A amostra apresentou oito professores da linguagem de Artes Visuais, com e sem formaÃÃo na Ãrea de Artes, do 6 Â ao 9 Â ano do Ensino Fundamental da rede pÃblica {{municipal}} de Fortaleza, CearÃ (CE). O trabalho de campo se pautou num curso experimental, no qual os participantes ocuparam papÃis inicialmente como discentes e posteriormente como docentes (em suas prÃprias salas de aula). A aquisiÃÃo do corpus da pesquisa foi obtida atravÃs de questionÃrios, entrevistas, memoriais, <b>ateliÃs</b> de experimentos artÃsticos em Artes Visuais e sessÃes reflexivas gravadas em vÃdeo. Os dados foram tratados sob a fusÃo de horizontes, com base na hermenÃutica de Gadamer (1997), na compreensÃo do tipo antes e depois, atravÃs das preconcepÃÃes e das concepÃÃes sobre o ensino de Artes Visuais. Depreende-se que os participantes do curso compreenderam que a produÃÃo artÃstica dos alunos pode resultar das ideias do prÃprio discente. Portanto, conclui-se que a experiÃncia adquirida nos laboratÃrios da metodologia proposta fez com que os docentes despertassem em seus aprendizes a descoberta de que estes sÃo depositÃrios de sua prÃpria poÃtica artÃstica, o que torna desnecessÃrio utilizar obras existentes como modelo a ser imitado. This thesis {{presents the}} poetic trails {{of teaching in}} Visual Arts, with the artistic and aesthetic experiment mediated by the artistic personal poetic as objective of rearrangement of the teacherâs formation in Visual Arts. The main {{purpose of the current}} research was to accomplish an investigation concerning the teacherâs conception of the language of Visual Artsâ teaching about artistic and aesthetic experiments as well as the assessment of those practices intending to readjust knowledge and practices in their pedagogic actions. The theoretical foundations of this thesis attributes that the object of study presents an ontological nature which requests the phenomenological approach, with art as an original element from the author (HEIDEGGER, 2003, 2005, 2010, 2011) and the deconstruction as a way of sprouting art (DERRIDA, 2002). The perspective of teaching Contemporary Art is also present, pointing to the conception that Art and life approach (BARBIERI, 2009; COHN, 2013; KONESKI, 2009; LEDUR, 2012; TESCH; VERGARA, 2012). The methodology adopted was the phenomenological educational investigation based on concepts and definitions of the thought of Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty (1999, 2009). The sample was composed by eight teachers of the language of Visual Arts, with and without formation in the area of Arts, from the 6 th to the 9 th year of Elementary School in the public school system of Fortaleza-CearÃ. The field work was established in an experimental course, in which the participants occupied roles initially as students and later as teachers (at their own classrooms). The acquisition of the corpus of this research was obtained through questionnaires, interviews, memorials, studios of artistic experiments in Visual Arts and reflexive sessions recorded in video. The data were treated according the fusion of horizons, based on the hermeneutic perspective of Gadamer (1997) and on the type before and after, through preconceptions and conceptions on the teaching of Visual Arts. The analysis of the results revealed that the participants of the course understood that the studentsâ artistic production can result of the apprenticeâs own ideas. In conclusion, the acquired experience in the laboratories of the proposed methodology allowed the teachers to promote the discovery, by their students, of their own artistic poetic. Thus, {{it is not necessary to}} use existent works as a model to be imitated...|$|R
50|$|Iron Grip: Warlord {{is set in}} a dieselpunk {{world with}} a society that can be {{described}} as a blend of Napoleonic era politics and World War II technology. The Iron Grip world is home to many different landmasses, but Warlord focuses on Kathos, a frigid region to the northeast resembling Eastern Europe. Kathos is divided into two large military powers and a handful of neutral countries. To the north is the Sovereign Republic of Rahmos, possessing the world's most powerful airship fleet and a technologically advanced military. Their territory includes a number of client states in addition to their home island. The country of Fahrong (known as the Confederation of Nallum) is the other major power. With uneven and mountainous terrain, the Confederates employ mechanized walkers known as 'Arachs' along with the largest standing army. Central to the game is <b>Atelia,</b> a medium-sized country known for its abundant resources and many different ethnic and tribal groups. At the time of the game, <b>Atelia</b> is a country traditionally divided into city-states and nomads. Its lands are contested by the two Kathos military powers and the remaining scraps of the country are ruled by Warlords.|$|E
