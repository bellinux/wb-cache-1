5|$|The fenjaan {{was a big}} pot full {{of water}} and <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>with</b> small hole in the center. When the bowl become full of water, it would sink into the pot, and the manager would empty the bowl and again {{put it on the}} top of the water in the pot.

5|$|Teapot: The teapot {{was invented}} during the Yuan Dynasty, tea {{preparation}} in previous dynasties did not utilize a teapot. In the Tang Dynasty, a cauldron {{was used to}} boil grounded tea, which was served in bowls. Song Dynasty tea was made by pouring water boiled using a kettle into <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>with</b> finely ground tea leaves. A brush was then used to stir the tea. The innovation of the teapot, a vessel that steeps tea leaves in boiling water, occurs during the late Yuan dynasty. Written evidence of a teapot appears in the Yuan Dynasty text, Jiyuan Conghua, which describes a teapot that the author, Cai Shizhan, bought from the scholar Sun Daoming. By the Ming Dynasty, teapots were widespread in China.|$|E
5|$|Although accurate, shadow clocks {{relied on}} the sun, and so were useless at night and in cloudy weather. The Egyptians {{therefore}} developed a number of alternative timekeeping instruments, including water clocks, and a system for tracking star movements. The oldest description of a water clock is from the tomb inscription of the 16th-century Egyptian court official Amenemhet, identifying him as its inventor. There were several types of water clocks, some more elaborate than others. One type consisted of <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>with</b> small holes in its bottom, which was floated on water and allowed to fill at a near-constant rate; markings {{on the side of}} the bowl indicated elapsed time, as the surface of the water reached them. The oldest-known waterclock was found in the tomb of pharaoh Amenhotep I (1525–1504), suggesting that they were first used in ancient Egypt. Another Egyptian method of determining the time during the night was using plumb-lines called merkhets. In use since at least 600, two of these instruments were aligned with Polaris, the north pole star, to create a north–south meridian. The time was accurately measured by observing certain stars as they crossed the line created with the merkhets.|$|E

5|$|The {{ritual is}} {{the central part of}} the celebration. Vespers vary from place to place with respect to the time of the {{beginning}} of the service, its length and structure. The laying of badnjak on the fire usually comes after the service, and is done by a priest or by a respected parishioner. Before the burning, the tree may be processionally carried around the church. In the case of more than one badnjak, the trees are placed in the shape of a cross. The assembled devotees throw then into the fire their twig bunches, each representing a small badnjak. The consecration or blessing is performed by a priest: he strews wheat grains over the badnjak, censes it while singing the Troparion of the Nativity, and as he intones prayers, he pours wine and spreads honey on it. Instead of applying wine and honey, holy water may be sprinkled on the tree by dipping a bunch of basil into <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>with</b> the water. This rite is generally performed after the placing on the fire, although it may happen before, in which case the consecration may be performed in the church itself or in its yard.|$|E

Variations feature tendon, tripe, or meatballs in southern Vietnam. Chicken pho is made {{using the same}} spices as beef, but the broth is made using only chicken bones and meat, {{as well as some}} internal organs of the chicken, such as the heart, the undeveloped eggs and the gizzard.|$|E
25|$|The Fenjaan {{consisted}} of a large pot full of water and <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>with</b> a small hole in the center. When the bowl became full of water, it would sink into the pot, and the manager would empty the bowl and again {{put it on the}} top of the water in the pot. He would record the number of times the bowl sank by putting small stones into a jar. The place where the clock was situated, and its managers, were collectively known as khaneh Fenjaan. Usually this would be the top floor of a public-house, with west- and east-facing windows to show the time of Sunset and Sunrise. There was also another time-keeping tool named a staryab or astrolabe, but it was mostly used for superstitious beliefs and was not practical for use as a farmers' calendar. The Zeebad Gonabad water clock was in use until 1965 when it was substituted by modern clocks.|$|E

500|$|The {{company has}} adapted its menu to {{accommodate}} different dietary lifestyles by adding several vegetarian options, including salads, the BK Veggie sandwich, and its deep-fried spicy bean burger that {{is sold in}} Burger King's international locations. The majority of these products do not qualify as vegan due {{to the presence of}} egg or dairy products; an example is the BK Veggie, which is approved by the British Vegetarian Society. Society guidelines do not require their approved products to be vegan, and allow ovo-lacto-vegetarian ingredients. The Veggie Burger is widely sold in other countries, sometimes under different names (for example, it is called a [...] "Country Burger" [...] in Germany). Burger King added low-carb variants of several of its products in 2004 that are in accordance with low-carb diets such as the Atkins diet and the South Beach Diet. Low-carbohydrate preparation consists of eliminating the bread and serving the product in <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>with</b> silverware.|$|E
500|$|The {{pattern of}} the {{brightest}} stars resembles that of Ursa Minor, in that the stars form a pattern reminiscent of <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>with</b> a handle. Lying south-southeast of Acrux in neighbouring Crux is Alpha Muscae. It is {{the brightest star in}} the constellation with an apparent magnitude of 2.7. Lying around 310 light-years away, it is a blue-white star of spectral type B2IV-V that is around 4520 times as luminous and 8 times as massive as the Sun. The star is a Beta Cephei variable with about 4.7 times the Sun's diameter, and pulsates every 2.2hours, varying by 1% in brightness. A nearby star of magnitude13 {{may or may not be}} a companion star. Marking the fly's tail is Gamma Muscae, a blue-white star of spectral type B5V that varies between magnitudes 3.84 and 3.86 over a period of 2.7days. It is a variable of a different type, classed as a Slowly pulsating B star, a type of variable. [...] It is around five times as massive as our Sun.|$|E
500|$|In Greek tradition, clepsydrae {{were used}} in court; later, the Romans adopted this practice, as well. There are several {{mentions}} of this in historical records and literature of the era; for example, in Theaetetus, Plato says that [...] "Those men, on the other hand, always speak in haste, for the flowing water urges them on". Another mention occurs in Lucius Apuleius' The Golden Ass: [...] "The Clerk of the Court began bawling again, this time summoning the chief {{witness for the prosecution}} to appear. Up stepped an old man, whom I did not know. He was invited to speak for as long as there was water in the clock; this was a hollow globe into which water was poured through a funnel in the neck, and from which it gradually escaped through fine perforations at the base". The clock in Apuleius's account was one of several types of water clock used. Another consisted of <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>with</b> a hole in its centre, which was floated on water. Time was kept by observing how long the bowl took to fill with water.|$|E

2500|$|Flemish waffles, or Gaufres à la Flamande, are a {{specialty}} of northern France and portions of western Belgium. The original recipe, published in 1740 by Louis-Auguste de Bourbon in Le Cuisinier Gascon, is as follows: Take [...] "deux litrons" [...] (1.7 liters or 7 cups) of flour and mix it in <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>with</b> salt and one ounce of brewer's yeast barm. Moisten it completely with warm milk. Then whisk fifteen {{egg whites and}} add that to the mixture, stirring continuously. Incorporate [...] "un livre" [...] (490 grams or 1.1 pounds) of fresh butter, and let the batter rise. Once the batter has risen, take your heated iron, made expressly for these waffles, and wrap some butter in a cloth and rub {{both sides of the}} iron with it. When the iron is completely heated, make your waffles, but do so gently for fear of burning them. Cooked, take them out, put them on a platter, and serve them with both sugar and orange blossom water on top.|$|E
