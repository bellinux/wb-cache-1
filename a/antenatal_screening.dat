40|$|Background: The {{increased}} {{prevalence of}} HIV infection in women {{is leading to}} a rising number of children born to HIV-infected mothers. As therapeutic possibilities for HIV/AIDS increase, the detection of undiagnosed HIV infections in pregnant women, followed by adequate management, is of crucial interest. Therapeutic protocols are being updated and increasingly applied in most European countries, {{but there is no}} structured information on policies and strategies with regard to <b>antenatal</b> HIV <b>screening</b> as such. Methods: In order to identify national policies with regard to <b>antenatal</b> HIV <b>screening,</b> a structured questionnaire was sent to key-informants within the ministries of health and national institutes for public health in each of the 25 EU Member States. Results: Information was obtained from all EU Member States with the exception of Cyprus and Luxembourg. Eighteen countries issued a national policy with regard to <b>antenatal</b> HIV <b>screening,</b> 16 opted for a system in which HIV testing is offered to all women attending antenatal services while only two opted for selective screening. None of the 18 countries with a national policy supports a mandatory screening strategy. The voluntary testing strategies are of two types: opting in versus opting out.

40|$|Background: The {{economics}} of universal <b>antenatal</b> HIV <b>screening</b> should be explored if mother-to-child transmission of HIV occurs, the health service infrastructure exists for universal screening and optimal risk reducing treatments can be supplied. Published cost-effectiveness analyses of universal <b>antenatal</b> HIV <b>screening</b> conducted for high-income countries have assumed prevalence’s of > 0. 01 %, for the base case, among the antenatal population. We model data for Australia, where prevalence is very low, {{to examine whether}} universal <b>antenatal</b> HIV <b>screening</b> is cost-effective in this setting. Methods: A static-decision-model of the incremental cost-effectiveness of universal antenatal-HIV-screening as compared to existing practice was developed. We evaluated a hypothetical cohort of the antenatal population of Australia for 2001 - 2002. A quasi-societal perspective was adopted, secondary data sources used and sensitivity analyses undertaken. All data relate to 2001 - 02 and costs and benefits incurred in the future were discounted to their present value. Results: The intervention would be cost-effective if the prevalence of undiagnosed HIV in the currently unscreened Australian antenatal population was ≥ 0. 004372 % (1 case in 22, 872). At this prevalence, incremental costs are exactly offset by incremental benefits. We predict 6. 95 new diagnoses of HIV, 1. 73 infections avoided and 46. 97 discounted-life-years gained. Applying favourable and unfavourable values for key variables suggests the prevalence at which the intervention would be cost-effective lies between 0. 0016 - 0. 0106 % (1 : 62, 500 – 1 : 9, 434).

50|$|GBS {{infections in}} newborns are {{separated}} into two clinical syndromes, early-onset disease (EOD) and late-onset disease (LOD). EOD manifests from 0 to 7 living {{days in the}} newborn, {{most of the cases}} of EOD being apparent within 24h of birth. The most common clinical syndromes of EOD are sepsis without apparent focus, pneumonia, and less frequently meningitis. EOD is acquired vertically (vertical transmission), through exposure of the fetus or the baby to GBS from the vagina of a colonized woman, either intrautero or during birth after rupture of membranes. Infants can be infected during passage through the birth canal, nevertheless newborns that acquire GBS through this route can become only colonized, and these colonized infants habitually do not develop EOD. Roughly 50% of newborns to GBS colonized mothers are also GBS colonized and (without prevention measures) 1-2% of these newborns will develop EOD. In the past, the incidence of EOD ranged from 0.7 to 3.7 per thousand live births in the US and from 0.2 to 3.25 per thousand in Europe. In 2008, after widespread use of <b>antenatal</b> <b>screening</b> and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, the CDC reported an incidence of 0.28 cases of EOD per thousand live births in the US.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Respect for patients' {{autonomy}} is {{a principle}} issue in medical ethics. Patients' understanding of <b>antenatal</b> serum <b>screening</b> for Down syndrome upon informed consent has barely been assessed. Our {{objective was to}} evaluate pregnant women's perceived level of understanding of this serum screening. Materials and Methods: Pregnant women between the 15 th and 21 st gestational week were randomized into control and experimental groups, {{and were asked to}} complete a questionnaire before and after genetic counselling provided by researchers. The primary endpoints were the perceived level of understanding of serum screening for Down syndrome and the autonomy of the decision making for this serum screening. The secondary endpoints were the anxiety and depression levels of these women. Results: Participants in the experimental group (n = 96) had a significantly higher perceived level of understanding of <b>antenatal</b> serum <b>screening</b> for Down syndrome than participants in the control group (n = 97). There were significantly more respondents in the experimental group making the decision themselves to undergo serum screening than women in the control group. Anxiety and depression levels were not significantly different between the women in the two groups. Conclusion: Pregnant women should be offered more information to allow them to make an informed decision before they undergo <b>antenatal</b> serum <b>screening</b> for Down syndrome. Comprehensive genetic counseling improved pregnant women's autonomy in deciding whether to participate in serum screening.

40|$|A {{systematic}} review of recent economic evaluations of <b>antenatal</b> <b>screening</b> was conducted. Relevant studies were identified {{from a number}} of sources including computerised databases, bibliographies of economic evaluations, and searches of unpublished manuscripts. Each study identified by the literature searches was categorised {{on the basis of its}} title and abstract. Studies considered relevant to the {{systematic review}} were obtained from libraries. The methodology, results, and policy implications of studies categorised as economic evaluations upon full review were documented. A total of 566 studies were identified by the literature searches, 41 of which were categorised as economic evaluations upon full review. The economic evaluations covered a range of <b>antenatal</b> <b>screening</b> practices, aimed mainly at the prevention of infectious diseases and fetal anomalies. The review highlighted the poor methodological quality of the bulk of economic evaluations of <b>antenatal</b> <b>screening.</b> The study design, data collection methods, and analysis and interpretation of results frequently violated methodological guidelines adopted by health economists.

40|$|BACKGROUND—Antenatal {{screening}} for cystic fibrosis has {{been endorsed by}} the US National Institutes of Health. Edinburgh is the only city in the UK with an established routine <b>antenatal</b> <b>screening</b> programme for cystic fibrosis.  AIMS—To report the change in numbers of infants diagnosed with cystic fibrosis born in Edinburgh after the introduction of <b>antenatal</b> <b>screening</b> for the disease.  POPULATION—Infants diagnosed as having cystic fibrosis (by sweat test or genotyping, or both) in the seven years before antenatal testing (1984 - 90) and {{the first five years}} of antenatal testing (1991 - 95). Children born in this region who had moved before diagnosis were identified from the UK cystic fibrosis survey database.  RESULTS—The incidence of cystic fibrosis decreased from an average of 4. 6 to 1. 6 children each year with <b>antenatal</b> <b>screening.</b> The reduction in the incidence (65 %) was greater than that accounted for by prenatal diagnosis and termination (36 %). Of the eight children born with cystic fibrosis during the period of <b>antenatal</b> <b>screening,</b> five had been subject to antenatal screening: three had only one mutation identified, one was missed due to a laboratory error, and one was identified as a one in four risk, but prenatal diagnosis was not performed.  CONCLUSIONS—Antenatal testing for cystic fibrosis has successfully reduced the incidence of cystic fibrosis in this region.

40|$|The {{continued}} {{occurrence of}} congenital syphilis is {{an indictment of}} the inadequate antenatal care services and poor quality of programmes to control sexually transmitted infections. More than 1 million infants are born with congenital syphilis each year. Despite national policies on antenatal testing and {{the widespread use of}} <b>antenatal</b> services, syphilis <b>screening</b> is still implemented only sporadically in many countries, leaving the disease undetected and untreated among many pregnant women. The weak organization of services and the costs of screening are the principal obstacles facing programmes. Decentralization of <b>antenatal</b> syphilis <b>screening</b> programmes, on-site testing and immediate treatment can reduce the number of cases of congenital syphilis. <b>Antenatal</b> syphilis <b>screening</b> and treatment programmes are as cost effective as many existing public health programmes, e. g. measles immunization. Diagnosis of congenital syphilis is problematic since {{more than half of all}} infants are asymptomatic, and signs in symptomatic infants may be subtle and nonspecific. Newer diagnostic tests such as enzyme immunoassays, polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting have made diagnosis more sensitive and specific but are largely unavailable in the settings where they are most needed. Guidelines developed for better-resourced settings are conservative and err on the side of overtreatment. They are difficult to implement in, or inappropriate for, poorly-resourced settings because of the lack of investigative ability and the pressure on health facilities to discharge infants early.

40|$|Objective: {{to explore}} what role {{religious}} beliefs of pregnant Muslim women play in their decision-making on <b>antenatal</b> <b>screening,</b> particularly regarding congenital abnormalities and termination, and whether their {{interpretations of the}} religious doctrines correspond to the main sources of Islam. Design: qualitative pilot study using in-depth interviews with pregnant Muslim women. Setting: one midwifery practice in a medium-sized city near Amsterdam participated in the study. Participants: 10 pregnant Muslim women of Turkish origin {{who live in a}} high density immigrant area and who attended primary midwives for antenatal care were included in the study. Data collection and data analysis: to explore {{the role of religion in}} decision-making on <b>antenatal</b> <b>screening</b> tests, a topic list was constructed, including four subjects: being a (practising) Muslim, the view on unborn life, the view on disabled life and the view on termination. To analyse the interviews, open and axial coding based on the Grounded Theory was used and descriptive and analytical themes were identified and interpreted. Findings: all 10 interviewees stated that their faith played a role in their decision-making on <b>antenatal</b> <b>screening,</b> specific to the combined test. They did not consider congenital anomalies as a problem and did not consider termination to be an option in case of a disabled fetus. However, the Islamic jurisprudence considers that termination is allowed if the fetus has serious abnormalities, but only before 19 weeks plus one day of gestation. Key conclusions: religious convictions play a role regarding <b>antenatal</b> <b>screening</b> in pregnant Muslim women of Turkish origin. The interviewees did not consider a termination in case of an affected child. Women were unaware that within Islamic tradition there is the possibility of termination if a fetus has serious anomalies. Incomplete knowledge of religious doctrines may be influencing both decisions of <b>antenatal</b> <b>screening</b> and diagnostic tests uptake and of terminating a pregnancy for fetuses with serious anomalies.

40|$|There {{now exists}} a {{considerable}} body of sociological work examining <b>antenatal</b> <b>screening</b> for fetal abnormalities.
