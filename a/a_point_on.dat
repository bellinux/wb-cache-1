5|$|Benfica started October on {{the road}} against former manager José Mourinho with União de Leiria. A final score of 1–1 made the fifth draw in just eight games for Benfica, but the team still gained <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> the title race, as Boavista and Porto were tied for first. Their second match of October was played in Da Luz against Gil Vicente on the 20th, and {{resulted}} in a 2–0 win for Benfica, after João Mawete opened the score in the second half. They played Farense away on the 26th, where a 2–0 win carried Benfica to second place and ended their eight-month streak without winning an away game.|$|E
5|$|Both {{games against}} Barcelona ended in draws. Despite Giggs, Scholes and Beckham putting the team into a 3–2 lead at Old Trafford, the {{visitors}} were awarded a late penalty after Butt was sent off for handling the ball. Luis Enrique converted {{the ball into}} the net to leave both teams with <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> Matchday One. In the return game on 25 November at the Camp Nou, a fixture that Barça needed to win to avoid elimination, Dwight Yorke's goals put United ahead 3–2, but Barça star Rivaldo equalized and nearly scored again but his effort hit the crossbar.|$|E

5|$|Paxton's cavalry {{met with}} Lane's {{infantry}} at <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> Cold Knob Mountain around noon on November 26. The two colonels conferred, and Lane decided that his regiment {{was not in}} condition to continue the mission. His men were wet and cold, and they began their return to their camp in Summerville. Paxton also considered ending the mission, but decided to continue after being convinced by Major Powell. Powell was assigned to lead the advance guard, and selected Lieutenant Jeremiah Davidson and 20 men from Company G to join him. The advance guard, followed {{by the rest of}} the cavalry regiment, proceeded down the mountain toward the rebel camps.|$|E

The modern name for <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> {{the south side of}} the bay is Punta Nijtún, which is probably derived from the colonial Yucatec nix tun, meaning stone ramp. Archaeologists carried out excavations at the lake shore at Punta Nijtún and discovered a stone ramp there, which was probably built by Ursúa's troops to launch his galeota.|$|E
5|$|A truce term {{is a word}} {{or short}} phrase {{accepted}} within a community of children as an effective way of calling for a temporary respite or truce during a game or activity, such as tag or its variants. Common examples in English speaking cultures are barley, fainites, crosses, kings and exe(s)in the United Kingdom, pegs and nibs in New Zealand and variants of barley in Australia. In the United States, terms based on time-out have, from the 1950s onwards, largely supplanted earlier common terms based on kings and exe(s). Since the late 1980s time-out has been recorded in other English speaking cultures besides the US. Examples of use of truce terms are if a child has a stitch or wants to raise <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> {{the rules of the}} game.|$|E
5|$|Diaby {{began the}} 2010–11 season scoring a goal and issuing an {{assist in the}} team's second match of the season against Blackpool; a 6–0 win. During a match against Bolton at the Emirates Stadium on 11 September, he was injured after a {{challenge}} by Paul Robinson. Diaby was replaced in the 72nd minute by Denílson in a 4–1 win. Due to the injury, he missed two weeks {{and return to the}} team in its 3–2 loss to West Bromwich Albion. Diaby featured primarily as a substitute after returning from the injury. On 5 February 2011, he was sent off after being adjudged to have committed violent conduct on opposing midfielder Joey Barton in a league match away to Newcastle. Prior to Diaby's expulsion, Arsenal had been leading the match 4–0. The team went on to concede four unanswered goals while playing with ten men, which resulted in the club leaving St James' Park with only <b>a</b> <b>point.</b> <b>On</b> 10 April, Diaby scored his second goal of the season in a 3–1 win against Blackpool.|$|E

5|$|Euan MacKie has {{supported}} Thom's analysis, {{to which he}} added an archaeological context by comparing Neolithic Britain to the Mayan civilization to argue for a stratified society in this period. To test his ideas he conducted a couple of excavations at proposed prehistoric observatories in Scotland. Kintraw is a site notable for its four-meter high standing stone. Thom proposed {{that this was a}} foresight to <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> the distant horizon between Beinn Shianaidh and Beinn o'Chaolias on Jura. This, Thom argued, was a notch on the horizon where a double sunset would occur at midwinter. However, from ground level, this sunset would be obscured by a ridge in the landscape, and the viewer would need to be raised by two meters: another observation platform was needed. This was identified across a gorge where a platform was formed from small stones. The lack of artifacts caused concern for some archaeologists and the petrofabric analysis was inconclusive, but further research at Maes Howe and on the Bush Barrow Lozenge led MacKie to conclude that while the term 'science' may be anachronistic, Thom was broadly correct upon the subject of high-accuracy alignments.|$|E
5|$|For Galileo, {{the tides}} {{were caused by}} the {{sloshing}} back and forth {{of water in the}} seas as <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> the Earth's surface sped up and slowed down because of the Earth's rotation on its axis and revolution around the Sun. He circulated his first account of the tides in 1616, addressed to Cardinal Orsini. His theory gave the first insight into the importance of the shapes of ocean basins in the size and timing of tides; he correctly accounted, for instance, for the negligible tides halfway along the Adriatic Sea compared to those at the ends. As a general account of the cause of tides, however, his theory was a failure.|$|E
5|$|SR 20 rises {{into the}} Sierra {{along the north}} side of the Yuba River, {{crossing}} to the south side near Smartsville and then climbing through several ravines to the Penn Valley. The current alignment, built in the mid-1980s as a mostly two-lane freeway, continues east across rugged terrain to the city of Grass Valley, where it joins SR 49 on the Golden Center Freeway. The two routes travel northeast to Nevada City, where SR 49 turns northwest and SR 20 resumes its eastward course as a two-lane highway. The roadway climbs from Nevada City and follows Harmony Ridge and Washington Ridge before descending into the Bear Valley via a series of hairpin turns, and then climbing, just north of Emigrant Gap, to its end at I-80 at Yuba Pass. The Pioneer Trail, a National Recreation Trail, parallels SR 20 from <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> Harmony Ridge to the Bear Valley, and includes parts of a branch of the California Trail first used in 1850.|$|E

5|$|The {{expedition}} {{arrived back}} in Cairo in late September 1829 where the expedition bought 10,000 francs worth of antiquities, a budget extended {{to them by}} minister Rochefoucauld. Arriving in Alexandria, they were notified that the French boat that would take them back was delayed, {{and they had to}} stay here two months until the sixth of December. On their return to Alexandria, the Khedive Muhammad Ali Pasha, offered the two obelisks standing at the entrance of Luxor Temple to France in 1829, but only one was transported to Paris, where it now stands on the Place de la Concorde. Champollion and the Pasha spoke often and on the Pasha's request Champollion wrote an outline of the history of Egypt. Here, Champollion {{had no choice but to}} challenge the short Biblical chronology arguing that Egyptian civilization had its origins at least 6000 years before Islam. The two also spoke about social reforms, Champollion championing education of the lower classes – <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> which the two did not agree.|$|E
5|$|The island {{they arrived}} on {{turned out to}} be {{uninhabited}} with little food and no apparent water. After a camp had been set up ashore, White was sent back to the still floating Grasshopper to scavenge supplies. He boarded the vessel and descended below decks to search for any items that might be of use. Whilst there, he felt Judy in the darkness, pinned in her bed under a row of lockers. He constructed a raft out of materials on the Grasshopper and rowed the items, along with Judy, back to the island. The lack of water was becoming an issue, until Judy began to dig at <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> the waterline. It took a couple of minutes, but Judy managed to unearth a fresh-water spring and was credited with saving everyone's lives. During the first night, the magazine on the Grasshopper finally caught light and exploded, sinking the vessel. The survivors continued to camp on the beach for the following few days, with Judy protecting them from snakes.|$|E
5|$|Indraloris molars {{are short}} and {{organized}} in two main lophs (lobes). They differ from Sivaladapis teeth in being shorter and broader, with a shorter talonid {{and a smaller}} hypoconulid. In Indraloris himalayensis lower molars, there are four main cusps (protoconid and metaconid in the trigonid, hypoconid and entoconid in the talonid), which give the crown a rectangular aspect, although the labial cusps (protoconid and hypoconid) are placed somewhat anterior to their lingual counterparts. In I.kamlialensis, the entoconid is distinct from the hypoconulid, which is large, but the tooth is otherwise similar. The cusps are high relative to those of extant lorises and approximately equal in height. The cristid obliqua, a crest, descends from the hypoconid to <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> the lingual side of the protoconid. On the hypoconid, this crest forms a right angle with the posterolophid, which runs towards the hypoconulid in the back lingual corner of the tooth. Between the metaconid and entoconid, the talonid basin is open. In I.himalayensis at least (the structure is damaged in the only known lower molar of I.kamlialensis) there is a well-developed hollow in the trigonid {{in front of the}} protoconid and metaconid. There is a labial cingulum between the protoconid and hypoconid. YGSP 32152 is so worn that little of its structure remains visible. It shows a short trigonid and a distinct entoconid. A small hypoconulid, close to the entoconid, is suggested by an enamel swelling. This specimen is fragmentary enough that it could also represent a catarrhine primate or a carnivoran.|$|E

5|$|Sunderland's season started against Tottenham Hotspur on 11 August 2007. Sunderland won {{the game}} through a last minute goal from Michael Chopra {{in front of an}} {{attendance}} of 43,967. Their second game of the season was an away fixture to Birmingham City, a Paul McShane own goal had put Sunderland behind in the 28th minute, but Michael Chopra scored his second goal of the season to equalise. Birmingham took the lead again through Garry O'Connor but Sunderland scored another last minute goal, this time from Stern John to save <b>a</b> <b>point.</b> <b>On</b> 24 August ex Manchester United and Newcastle United striker Andy Cole joined the club on a free transfer from Portsmouth. Sunderland travelled to the JJB Stadium unbeaten on 18 August but lost 3–0 to Wigan Athletic. On 25 September Liverpool beat Sunderland 2–0 to give them their second consecutive defeat. On the same day, Tobias Hysén returned to his native Sweden with IFK Göteborg after {{he and his wife were}} suffering from home sickness. Luton Town produced a league cup shock as they beat Sunderland 3–0 at Kenilworth Road. Sunderland signed three more players before the transfer deadline; Ian Harte from Levante on a free transfer, Danny Higginbotham from Stoke City for £3 million, and Kenwyne Jones from Southampton for £6 million with Stern John going in the opposite direction.|$|E
