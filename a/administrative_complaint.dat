2500|$|On 27 June 2007, the Federal Trade Commission {{issued an}} <b>administrative</b> <b>complaint</b> {{challenging}} the acquisition.

2500|$|During {{his time}} at the Law School, Stewart {{challenged}} discrimination from a Minneapolis restaurant that refused to serve him a meal because of his race. [...] Several other patrons observed the incident and left their names with Stewart, who filed an <b>administrative</b> <b>complaint</b> with the Minneapolis City Attorney's Office under the recently passed 1897 state civil rights law. [...] After an investigation, the office filed the first prosecution under the law, charging the owner with violating Stewart's civil rights. [...] The owner had previously served black patrons, but once their numbers had risen his white customers dropped off; once he made objections to the black patrons, they also left him. [...] The trial was well attended, and the jury needed only fifteen minutes of deliberation to convict the owner on the charges.|$|E

[...] In 2013, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held that Lens.com did not commit trademark infringement when it purchased search advertisements using 1-800 Contacts' federally registered 1800 CONTACTS trademark as a keyword. [...] In August 2016, the Federal Trade Commission filed an <b>administrative</b> <b>complaint</b> against 1-800 Contacts alleging, among other things, that its search advertising trademark enforcement practices have unreasonably restrained competition {{in violation of the}} FTC Act.

2500|$|On June 27, 2007, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) {{issued an}} <b>administrative</b> <b>complaint</b> {{challenging}} Whole Foods Market, Inc.'s acquisition of Wild Oats Markets Inc. According to the complaint, the FTC {{believed that the}} proposed transaction would violate federal antitrust laws by eliminating the substantial competition between two close competitors {{in the operation of}} premium natural and organic supermarkets nationwide. The FTC contended that if the transaction were to proceed Whole Foods Market would have the ability to raise prices and reduce quality and services. Both Whole Foods Market and Wild Oats stated their intention to vigorously oppose the FTC's complaint and a court hearing on the issue was scheduled for July 31 and August 1, 2007.

40|$|Employment {{discrimination}} complaints {{filed with}} state and local administrative agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) also document a widespread and persistent pattern of sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination against LGBT state and local employees. This chapter proceeds in five parts. The first part reviews academic scholarship analyzing the number and scope of <b>administrative</b> <b>complaints</b> that have been filed based on allegations of sexual orientation or gender identity discrimination. The second part presents original research by the Williams Institute conducted during 2008 and 2009 updating these studies. The Williams Institute study is based on <b>administrative</b> <b>complaints</b> filed by state and local employees alleging sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination from 18 states (Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, George, Kentucky, Maine, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin). The third part provides additional research by the Williams Institute, which compares sexual orientation, race, and sex discrimination <b>administrative</b> <b>complaints,</b> and finds that the filing rates are comparable when the underlying populations are taken into account. The fourth part discusses additional academic research that indicates {{that the number of}} <b>administrative</b> <b>complaints</b> is almost certainly lower than the rate of actual employment discrimination experienced by LGBT people. The final part presents additional new research by the Williams Institute conducted during 2009 reporting the nature and number of complaints lodged with NGOs that provide legal representation to the LGBT community...|$|R

50|$|In the 1980s, {{the role}} of the classic welfare state was no longer {{regarded}} as necessarily positive, and welfare was increasingly provided by private entities. Legal aid was increasingly provided through private providers, but they remained focused on providing assistance in court cases. Citizens were increasingly regarded as consumers, who should be able to choose among services. Where {{it was not possible to}} provide such a choice, citizens were given the right to voice their dissatisfaction through <b>administrative</b> <b>complaints</b> processes. This resulted in tension, as legal aid was not designed to offer advice to those seeking redress through <b>administrative</b> <b>complaints</b> processes. Tensions also began to emerge as states which emphasised individual enforcement of economic, social and cultural rights, rather than collective enforcement through polices, reduced funding for legal aid as a welfare state provision. Individual enforcement of welfare entitlement requires the kind of legal aid funding states emphasising collective enforcement were more likely to provide.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Tor is {{a popular}} low-latency {{anonymous}} communi-cation system. It is, however, currently abused in various ways. Tor exit routers are frequently troubled by <b>administrative</b> and legal <b>complaints.</b> To gain an insight into such abuse, we designed and implemented a novel system, TorWard, for the discovery and the systematic study of malicious traffic over Tor. The system can avoid legal and <b>administrative</b> <b>complaints,</b> and allows the investigation to be performed in a sensitive environment such as a university campus. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is used to discover and classify malicious traffic. We performed comprehensive analysis and extensive real-world experiments to validate the feasibility {{and the effectiveness of}} TorWard. Our results show that around 10 % Tor traffic can trigger IDS alerts. Malicious traffic includes P 2 P traffic, malware traffic (e. g., botnet traffic), denial-of-service attack traffic, spam, and others...|$|R
