5|$|Bradley's {{childhood}} hero Dick Kazmaier {{had won the}} Heisman Trophy at Princeton, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> #42 in his honor. In {{his freshman}} year, Bradley averaged more than 30 points per game for the freshman team, at one point making 57 consecutive free throws, breaking a record set {{by a member of}} the NBA's Syracuse Nationals. The following year, as a sophomore, he was a varsity starter in Butch van Breda Kolff's first year as coach of the Tigers.|$|E
5|$|White {{was handed}} the number34 {{guernsey}} at Fremantle <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> {{the number for}} the rest of his career. He credits Percy Johnson with guiding his ruck style in his time with Fremantle. He played 32games and kicked 18 goals with the Dockers between 1995 and 1997, before being traded back to his home state of Victoria to play for Melbourne. Salary-cap breaches involved in White's trade caused Melbourne to forfeit their highest selection (pick number 5) in the 1999 draft to Fremantle.|$|E
5|$|Through the {{intervention}} of a friend, Khrushchev was assigned in 1921 as assistant director for political affairs for the Rutchenkovo mine in the Donbas region, where he had previously worked. There were as yet few Bolsheviks in the area. At that time, the movement was split by Lenin's New Economic Policy, which allowed for some measure of private enterprise and {{was seen as an}} ideological retreat by some Bolsheviks. While Khrushchev's responsibility lay in political affairs, he involved himself in the practicalities of resuming full production at the mine after the chaos of the war years. He helped restart the machines (key parts and papers had been removed by the pre-Soviet mineowners) <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> his old mine outfit for inspection tours.|$|E

5|$|Del Piero {{was part}} of Dino Zoff's Italy's squad that reached the final of Euro 2000. Although he was {{primarily}} used {{as a substitute for}} either Francesco Totti or Stefano Fiore, Del Piero appeared in every match of the tournament, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> the number 10 shirt. On 11 June, Del Piero came on as a substitute for Fiore in the 30th minute in Italy's opening Group B 2–1 win against Turkey, hitting the cross-bar from a free-kick. In the final group game, Del Piero started the match and scored the winner with a notable goal against Sweden, taking it past two players before curling the ball into the top corner from outside the area with a left-footed strike; Del Piero also set up Luigi Di Biagio's opener from a corner. Del Piero made his second start of the tournament for Italy in their semi-final against co-hosts, Netherlands, which Italy won on penalties following a 0–0 draw after extra-time. In the final, he missed two gilt-edged chances in Italy's 2–1 loss to France in extra time, and was criticised by the Italian press.|$|E
5|$|July 9, 1861 {{was a hot}} day, and Fanny {{was putting}} locks of her children's hair into an {{envelope}} and attempting to seal it with hot sealing wax while Longfellow took a nap. Her dress suddenly caught fire, though it is unclear exactly how; burning wax or a lighted candle may have fallen onto it. Longfellow was awakened from his nap and rushed to help her, throwing a rug over her, though it was too small. He stifled the flames with his body as best he could, but she was already badly burned. Over half a century later, Longfellow's youngest daughter Annie explained the story differently, claiming {{that there had been}} no candle or wax but that the fire had started from a self-lighting match that had fallen on the floor. Both accounts state that Fanny was taken to her room to recover and a doctor was called. She {{was in and out of}} consciousness throughout the night and was administered ether. She died shortly after 10:00 the next morning, July 10, after requesting a cup of coffee. Longfellow, in trying to save her, had burned himself badly enough so that he was unable to attend her funeral. His facial injuries led him to stop shaving, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> a beard from then on that became his trademark.|$|E

25|$|These {{various kinds}} of court uniforms {{continued}} to be used at court functions and ceremonies even into the Shōwa period, at events like the Imperial enthronement and the first visit of Emperor of Manchukuo Puyi to Japan. However, as the strain of war continued, opportunities for their use became rarer and rarer.

25|$|When {{the former}} King EdwardVIII went into exile as the Duke of Windsor in 1936 {{following}} his abdication, he took {{with him the}} Coronet of George, Prince of Wales– a highly controversial act.

George's son, Edward, when Prince of Wales, wore it at the coronation of his father in 1911. When Edward was invested as Prince of Wales a new coronet was designed and used.

25|$|In {{the western}} mound were found {{the remains of}} a man and animals, {{probably}} for food during the journey. The remains of a warrior's equipment were found. Luxurious weapons and other objects, both domestic and imported, show that the buried man was very powerful. These remains include a Frankish sword adorned with gold and garnets and a board game with Roman pawns of ivory. He was dressed in a costly suit made of Frankish cloth with golden threads, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> a belt with a sumptuous buckle. There were four cameos from the Middle East which were probably part of a casket. The finds show the distant contacts of the people of Uppland in the 6th century.|$|E

An excavation in this mound showed that a man was buried there c. 575 on a bear skin with two dogs and rich grave offerings. There were luxurious weapons and other objects, both domestic and imported, show that the buried man was very powerful.

25|$|Physically McKeag, like Johnny Adair, was shaven-headed, muscular {{and heavily}} tattooed <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> a {{miniature}} golden gun {{around his neck}} on a thick gold chain. Maintaining a number of girlfriends simultaneously, McKeag fathered four children by four different women – two daughters both called Stephanie and two sons both called Stephen. In the case of one child, McKeag even delivered it himself after his Newtownards-based girlfriend broke her waters in his car, forcing him to pull into a petrol station to deliver the baby. One of McKeag's girlfriends was Jacqueline Newell who had previously been involved with Derek Adgey, a one-time member of the Royal Marines. Both Newell and Adgey were sentenced in 1995 for passing information about leading republicans including Brian Gillen and Alex Maskey to the UDA {{and it has been}} claimed that McKeag was their main point of contact with the organisation. McKeag was also dating Tracey Coulter, daughter of the UDA's Jackie Coulter, later murdered in a UDA/UVF feud.|$|E

25|$|In 1898, Blue Horse {{became friends}} with the noted artist Elbridge Ayer (E.A.) Burbank while he was visiting the Pine Ridge Agency. Burbank painted sitting portraits of the {{greatest}} Native American leaders, including Geronimo, Sitting Bull, Red Cloud and Chief Joseph. Burbank painted more than 1200 portraits of Native Americans from 125 tribes. At the time, Blue Horse was eighty {{years of age and}} rode each day on his horse to pose for Burbank, who he called “Son of the Shadow-Maker.” Burbank was also an historian and his fond recollections illuminate Blue Horse. “Hardly a day passed without Blue Horse coming to my studio to visit me. He would sit down and smoke a little, short, strong pipe and gossip with the other Indians present; all the time he was talking he would be fanning himself with the wing of a turkey. His face usually was painted red, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> all the Indian clothes he had, with a single feather on his head. He was a thorough Indian, and extremely kind-hearted. His principal object in life was to try to make others happy around him.” Burbank recorded his stories of Blue Horse.|$|E
500|$|Depp wears a dreadlock wig in a rock-and-roll {{approach}} to a pirate aesthetic. He wears a red bandanna and numerous objects in his hair, influenced by Keith Richards' habit of collecting souvenirs from his travels; Sparrow's decorations include his [...] "piece of eight". Sparrow wears kohl around his eyes, which was inspired by Depp's study of nomads, whom he compared to pirates, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> contacts that acted as sunglasses. Sparrow has several gold teeth, two of which belong to Depp, although they were applied during filming. Depp initially forgot to have them removed after shooting The Curse of the Black Pearl, and wore them throughout the shooting of the sequels. Like all aspects of Depp's performance, Disney initially expressed great concern over Depp's teeth. Sparrow wears his goatee in two braids. Initially wire was used in them, but the wires were abandoned because they made the braids stick up when Depp lay down. Sparrow has numerous tattoos, and has been branded a pirate on his right arm by Cutler Beckett, underneath a tattoo of a sparrow.|$|E
500|$|Throughout his flying service Ball was {{primarily}} a [...] "lone-wolf" [...] pilot, stalking his prey from below until he drew close enough to use his top-wing Lewis gun on its Foster mounting, angled to fire upwards into the enemy's fuselage. [...] According to fellow ace and Victoria Cross recipient James McCudden, [...] "it was quite {{a work of art}} to pull this gun down and shoot upwards, {{and at the same time}} manage one's machine accurately". [...] Ball was as much a loner on the ground as in the air, preferring to stay in his hut on the flight line away from other squadron members. His off-duty hours were spent tending his small garden and practising the violin. [...] Though not unsociable per se, he was extremely sensitive and shy. Ball acted as his own mechanic on his aircraft and, as a consequence, was often untidy and dishevelled. His singularity in dress extended to his habit of flying without a helmet and goggles, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> his thick black hair longer than regulations generally permitted.|$|E

500|$|Before {{he could}} enter Rugby, Phipps was offered instead a cadetship {{and entered the}} {{government}} preparatory school at Carlshalton, in Surrey. In 1849, {{at the age of}} 11, he put on a uniform, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> it, or a variation of it, until his retirement in 1887. Phipps later attended the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. After his graduation, he expected a commission in the Royal Artillery, and while awaiting it, he lived for a few months with his uncle at Carragh, Ireland; his lieutenant's commission arrived, dated 1 August 1855, and with it instructions him to join his Royal Artillery unit at Woolwich, for service in the Crimean War. He reached the Crimea in November 1855, and participated in the Siege of Sevastopol. Assigned to the Matthew Dixon's 5th Company, 9th Battalion, {{he was part of the}} right siege train, and his chief occupation was blowing up the Sevastapol docks. He was still small for his age, and looked very young, which drew teasing from his company. The siege work was difficult and the living conditions were brutal; he recounted to his brother that the soldiers were plagued not only by the Russian fire, but by dysentery, bad food, and wintering in tents. He returned to England the following year on the Imperatrice, arriving in March 1856. [...] Although he was given a medal to wear when Queen Victoria reviewed the troops, it was later collected from him; the decision was made at higher commands that only those who had landed in the Crimea prior to September 1855 would be awarded the Crimea Medal.|$|E
500|$|Liu Kang {{was played}} by Ho Sung Pak {{in the first}} two games, and John Tobias stated in an {{interview}} that he originally intended for the character to be a traditional bald monk, but the actor refused to shave his head. In the first game, Liu Kang was modeled after Bruce Lee, as he had short hair and went shirtless, with a threadbare outfit of only black pants and white shoes. In Mortal Kombat II, his outfit was enhanced with red stripes, and now included a red headband, black shoes, and studded wristguards (the intro of MKII shows the younger version of the character defeating Shang Tsung in the background, while the updated character is in the foreground). In Mortal Kombat 3, his hair was considerably longer, with the only alteration to his outfit being thin black leg strips wrapped above his ankles in order to give him a [...] "sleeker" [...] look for the game. He was given a red tank top in addition to his usual costume in Mortal Kombat 4, but his alternate outfit was blue and featured him shirtless again. His wardrobe from the third game was carried over into Deception and Armageddon, but due to his resurrection, his skin was ash gray, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> hooked chains around his wrists. This form is also known by fans and Mortal Kombat producer Shaun Himmerick as [...] "Zombie Liu Kang". Nevertheless, his alternate outfit for both games featured him as a living person in order to contrast his undead form. In Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, he sported a slightly altered version of his third costume, in addition to a championship belt adorned with the Mortal Kombat dragon emblem. Although Liu Kang's design in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks remains similar to his Mortal Kombat II one, Himmerick said that it was the most revised one from the game, along with Kung Lao's.|$|E
