5|$|The carrot is a diploid species, and {{has nine}} {{relatively}} short, uniform-length chromosomes (2n=18). The genome size {{is estimated to}} be 473 mega base pairs, which is four times larger than <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana,</b> one-fifth the size of the maize genome, and about {{the same size as the}} rice genome.|$|E
5|$|Plant serpins were {{amongst the}} first {{members of the}} {{superfamily}} that were identified. The serpin barley protein Z is highly abundant in barley grain, {{and one of the}} major protein components in beer. The genome of the model plant, <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> contain 18 serpin-like genes, although only 8 of these are full-length serpin sequences.|$|E
5|$|The {{thioredoxin}} system {{contains the}} 12-kDa protein thioredoxin and its companion thioredoxin reductase. Proteins related to thioredoxin {{are present in}} all sequenced organisms. Plants, such as <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana,</b> have a particularly great diversity of isoforms. The active site of thioredoxin consists of two neighboring cysteines, {{as part of a}} highly conserved CXXC motif, that can cycle between an active dithiol form (reduced) and an oxidized disulfide form. In its active state, thioredoxin acts as an efficient reducing agent, scavenging reactive oxygen species and maintaining other proteins in their reduced state. After being oxidized, the active thioredoxin is regenerated by the action of thioredoxin reductase, using NADPH as an electron donor.|$|E
5|$|A {{considerable}} amount of new knowledge about plant function comes from studies of the molecular genetics of model plants such as the Thale cress, <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana,</b> a weedy species in the mustard family (Brassicaceae). The genome or hereditary information contained in the genes of this species is encoded by about 135 million base pairs of DNA, forming {{one of the smallest}} genomes among flowering plants. Arabidopsis was the first plant to have its genome sequenced, in 2000. The sequencing of some other relatively small genomes, of rice (Oryza sativa) and Brachypodium distachyon, has made them important model species for understanding the genetics, cellular and molecular biology of cereals, grasses and monocots generally.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the harsh}} environment, several life forms {{have been found}} that can {{withstand}} extreme space conditions for extended periods. Species of lichen carried on the ESA BIOPAN facility survived exposure for ten days in 2007. Seeds of <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> and Nicotiana tabacum germinated after being exposed to space for 1.5 years. A strain of bacillus subtilis has survived 559 days when exposed to low-Earth orbit or a simulated martian environment. The lithopanspermia hypothesis suggests that rocks ejected into outer space from life-harboring planets may successfully transport life forms to another habitable world. A conjecture is that just such a scenario occurred early {{in the history of}} the Solar System, with potentially microorganism-bearing rocks being exchanged between Venus, Earth, and Mars.|$|E
5|$|Systemin is a plant {{peptide hormone}} {{involved}} in the wound response in the Solanaceae family. It was the first plant hormone that was {{proven to be a}} peptide having been isolated from tomato leaves in 1991 by a group led by Clarence A. Ryan. Since then other peptides, with similar functions have been identified in tomato and outside of the Solanaceae. Hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptides were found in tobacco in 2001 and AtPEPs (<b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> Plant Elicitor Peptides) were found in <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> in 2006. Their precursors are found both in the cytoplasm and cell walls of plant cells, upon insect damage, the precursors are processed to produce one or more mature peptides. The receptor for systemin was first thought to be the same as the brassinolide receptor but this is now uncertain. The signal transduction processes that occur after the peptides bind are similar to the cytokine-mediated inflammatory immune response in animals. Early experiments showed that systemin travelled around the plant after insects had damaged the plant, activating systemic acquired resistance, now it is thought that it increases the production of jasmonic acid causing the same result. The main function of systemins is to coordinate defensive responses against insect herbivores but they also affect plant development. Systemin induces the production of protease inhibitors which protect against insect herbivores, other peptides activate defensins and modify root growth. They have also been shown to affect plants' responses to salt stress and UV radiation. AtPEPs have been shown to affect resistance against oomycetes and may allow A. thaliana to distinguish between different pathogens. In Nicotiana attenuata, some of the peptides have stopped being involved in defensive roles and instead affect flower morphology.|$|E
5|$|One type of {{sympatric}} speciation involves crossbreeding of two related species {{to produce a}} new hybrid species. This is not common in animals as animal hybrids are usually sterile. This is because during meiosis the homologous chromosomes from each parent are from different species and cannot successfully pair. However, it {{is more common in}} plants because plants often double their number of chromosomes, to form polyploids. This allows the chromosomes from each parental species to form matching pairs during meiosis, since each parent's chromosomes are represented by a pair already. An example of such a speciation event is when the plant species <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> and Arabidopsis arenosa crossbred to give the new species Arabidopsis suecica. This happened about 20,000 years ago, and the speciation process has been repeated in the laboratory, which allows the study of the genetic mechanisms involved in this process. Indeed, chromosome doubling within a species may be a common cause of reproductive isolation, as half the doubled chromosomes will be unmatched when breeding with undoubled organisms.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{interference}} is a {{vital part}} of the immune response to viruses and other foreign genetic material, especially in plants where it may also prevent the self-propagation of transposons. Plants such as <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> express multiple dicer homologs that are specialized to react differently when the plant is exposed to different viruses. Even before the RNAi pathway was fully understood, it was known that induced gene silencing in plants could spread throughout the plant in a systemic effect and could be transferred from stock to scion plants via grafting. This phenomenon has since been recognized as a feature of the plant adaptive immune system and allows the entire plant to respond to a virus after an initial localized encounter. In response, many plant viruses have evolved elaborate mechanisms to suppress the RNAi response. These include viral proteins that bind short double-stranded RNA fragments with single-stranded overhang ends, such as those produced by dicer. Some plant genomes also express endogenous siRNAs in response to infection by specific types of bacteria. These effects may be part of a generalized response to pathogens that downregulates any metabolic process in the host that aids the infection process.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, by the {{beginning}} of the latter half of the 1900s, <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> had begun to be used in some developmental studies. The first collection of <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> mutants were made around 1945. However it formally became established as a model organism only in 1998.|$|E
25|$|Salicylic acid is bio{{synthesized}} {{from the}} amino acid phenylalanine. In <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> {{it can be}} synthesized via a phenylalanine-independent pathway.|$|E
25|$|Many {{genes in}} the {{flowering}} time pathway are conserved across all plants studied to date. However, {{this does not mean}} that the mechanism of action is similarly conserved. For example, the monocot rice accelerates its flowering in short-day conditions, while <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana,</b> a eudicot, responds to long-day conditions. In both plants, the proteins CO and FT are present but in <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> CO enhances FT production, while in rice the CO homolog represses FT production, resulting in completely opposite downstream effects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> (thale cress, {{mouse-ear}} cress or arabidopsis) {{is a small}} flowering plant native to Eurasia. A. thaliana is considered a weed; it is found by roadsides and in disturbed land.|$|E
25|$|In {{research}} {{tobacco and}} <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> {{are the most}} frequently modified plants, due to well-developed transformation methods, easy propagation and well studied genomes. They serve as model organisms for other plant species.|$|E
25|$|Ongoing {{research}} on <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> is being {{performed on the}} International Space Station by the European Space Agency. The goals are to study the growth and reproduction of plants from seed to seed in microgravity.|$|E
25|$|If calcium is deficient, pectin {{cannot be}} synthesized, and {{therefore}} the cell walls cannot be bonded and thus an impediment of the meristems. This will lead to necrosis of stem and root tips and leaf edges. For example, necrosis of tissue can occur in <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> due to plant pathogens.|$|E
25|$|In higher plants, P. aeruginosa induces soft rot, {{for example}} in <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> (Thale cress) and Lactuca sativa (lettuce). It is also {{pathogenic}} to invertebrate animals, including the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila and the moth Galleria mellonella. The associations of virulence factors are the same for plant and animal infections.|$|E
25|$|Another floral {{feature that}} has been a subject of natural {{selection}} is flowering time. Some plants flower early in their life cycle, others require a period of vernalization before flowering. This decision is based on factors like temperature, light intensity, presence of pollinators and other environmental signals. In <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> it is known that genes like CONSTANS (CO), FRIGIDA, Flowering Locus C (FLC) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) integrate the environmental signals and initiate the flower development pathway. Allelic variation in these loci have been associated with flowering time variations between plants. For example, <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> ecotypes that grow in the cold temperate regions require prolonged vernalization before they flower, while the tropical varieties and common lab strains, do not. Much of this variation is due to mutations in the FLC and FRIGIDA genes, rendering them non-functional.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} signals that {{regulate}} the molecular biology of the process. The following three genes in <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> possess both common and independent functions in floral transition: FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), LEAFY (LFY), SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1, also called AGAMOUS-LIKE20). SOC1 is a MADS-box-type gene, which integrates responses to photoperiod, vernalization and gibberellins.|$|E
25|$|It {{seems that}} {{on the level of}} the organ, the leaf may be the {{ancestor}} of the flower, or at least some floral organs. When we mutate some crucial genes involved in flower development, we end up with a cluster of leaf-like structures. Thus, sometime in history, the developmental program leading to formation of a leaf must have been altered to generate a flower. There probably also exists an overall robust framework within which the floral diversity has been generated. An example of that is a gene called LEAFY (LFY), which is involved in flower development in <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana.</b> The homologs of this gene are found in angiosperms as diverse as tomato, snapdragon, pea, maize and even gymnosperms. Expression of <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> LFY in distant plants like poplar and citrus also results in flower-production in these plants. The LFY gene regulates the expression of some gene belonging to the MADS-box family. These genes, in turn, act as direct controllers of flower development.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the high}} number of MAPK genes, MAPK {{pathways}} of higher plants were studied less than animal or fungal ones. Although their signaling appears very complex, the MPK3, MPK4 and MPK6 kinases of <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> are key mediators of responses to osmotic shock, oxidative stress, response to cold and involved in anti-pathogen responses. In addition, they are also involved in morphogenesis, since MPK4 mutants display severe dwarfism.|$|E
25|$|Plants have {{mechanisms}} that protect against {{adverse effects of}} strong light. The most studied biochemical protective mechanism is non-photochemical quenching of excitation energy. Visible-light-induced photoinhibition is ~25% faster in an <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> mutant lacking non-photochemical quenching than in the wild type. It is also apparent that turning or folding of leaves, as occurs, e.g., in Oxalis species in response to exposure to high light, protects against photoinhibition.|$|E
25|$|Thylakoid {{formation}} {{requires the}} action of vesicle-inducing protein in plastids 1 (VIPP1). Plants cannot survive without this protein, and reduced VIPP1 levels lead to slower growth and paler plants with reduced ability to photosynthesize. VIPP1 appears to be required for basic thylakoid membrane formation, {{but not for the}} assembly of protein complexes of the thylakoid membrane. It is conserved in all organisms containing thylakoids, including cyanobacteria, green algae, such as Chlamydomonas, and higher plants, such as <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana.</b>|$|E
25|$|Significant {{progress}} has been made in understanding DNA methylation in the model plant <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana.</b> DNA methylation in plants differs from that of mammals: while DNA methylation in mammals mainly occurs on the cytosine nucleotide in a CpG site, in plants the cytosine can be methylated at CpG, CpHpG, and CpHpH sites, where H represents any nucleotide but not guanine. Overall, Arabidopsis DNA is highly methylated, mass spectrometry analysis estimated 14% of cytosines to be modified.|$|E
25|$|In many cases, {{these events}} can be {{inferred}} only through comparing sequenced genomes. Examples of unexpected but recently confirmed ancient genome duplications include baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), mustard weed/thale cress (<b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana),</b> rice (Oryza sativa), and an early evolutionary ancestor of the vertebrates (which includes the human lineage) and another near {{the origin of the}} teleost fishes. Angiosperms (flowering plants) have paleopolyploidy in their ancestry. All eukaryotes probably have experienced a polyploidy event {{at some point in their}} evolutionary history.|$|E
25|$|The gene HIC (high carbon dioxide) encodes a {{negative}} regulator {{for the development}} of stomata in plants. perception to stomatal development | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 408 | issue = | pages = 713–716 }} Research into the HIC gene using <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> found no increase of stomatal development in the dominant allele, but in the ‘wild type’ recessive allele showed a large increase, both in response to rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere. These studies imply the plants response to changing CO2 levels is largely controlled by genetics.|$|E
25|$|However, a {{study on}} samples of 100,000 ESTs each from human, mouse, rat, cow, fly (D. melanogaster), worm (C. elegans), and the plant <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> found no large {{differences}} in frequency of alternatively spliced genes among humans and {{any of the other}} animals tested. Another study, however, proposed that these results were an artifact of the different numbers of ESTs available for the various organisms. When they compared alternative splicing frequencies in random subsets of genes from each organism, the authors concluded that vertebrates do have higher rates of alternative splicing than invertebrates.|$|E
25|$|Two of DNA's four bases, {{cytosine}} and adenine, can be methylated. Cytosine methylation {{is widespread}} in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, {{even though the}} rate of cytosine DNA methylation can differ greatly between species: 14% of cytosines are methylated in <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana,</b> 8% in Physarum, 4% in Mus musculus, 2.3% in Escherichia coli, 0.03% in Drosophila, 0.006% in Dictyostelium and virtually none (< 0.0002%) in Caenorhabditis or yeast species such as S. cerevisiae and S. pombe (but not N. crassa). Adenine methylation has been observed in bacterial, plant and recently in mammalian DNA, but have received considerably less attention.|$|E
25|$|In plants, {{there are}} no bona fide {{integrin}} receptors identified to date; nevertheless, several integrin-like proteins were proposed based on structural homology with the metazoan receptors. Interestingly, plants contain integrin-linked kinases that are very similar in their primary structure with the animal ILKs. In the experimental model plant <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana,</b> one of the integrin-linked kinase genes, ILK1, {{has been shown to}} be a critical element in the plant immune response to signal molecules from bacterial pathogens and plant sensitivity to salt and osmotic stress. ILK1 protein interacts with the high-affinity potassium transporter HAK5 and with the calcium sensor CML9.|$|E
25|$|Ethylene is {{perceived}} {{by a family}} of five transmembrane protein dimers such as the ETR1 protein in Arabidopsis. The gene encoding an ethylene receptor has been cloned in <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> and then in tomato. Ethylene receptors are encoded by multiple genes in the Arabidopsis and tomato genomes. Mutations {{in any of the}} gene family, which comprises five receptors in Arabidopsis and at least six in tomato, can lead to insensitivity to ethylene. DNA sequences for ethylene receptors have also been identified in many other plant species and an ethylene binding protein has even been identified in Cyanobacteria.|$|E
25|$|The recent spurt in {{information}} on various plant-related processes {{has largely been}} {{a result of the}} revolution in molecular biology. Powerful techniques like mutagenesis and complementation were made possible in <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> via generation of T-DNA containing mutant lines, recombinant plasmids, techniques like transposon tagging etc. Availability of complete physical and genetic maps, RNAi vectors, and rapid transformation protocols are some of the technologies that have significantly altered the scope of the field. Recently, there has also been a massive increase in the genome and EST sequences of various non-model species, which, coupled with the bioinformatics tools existing today, generate opportunities in the field of plant evo-devo research.|$|E
25|$|The genomes {{of several}} {{species in the}} genus Genlisea were studied in 2006. According to the study, prior to its {{publication}} the smallest known angiosperm (flowering plant) genome was that of <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> at 157 Megabase pairs (Mbp). With a diploid chromosome number of around 52 (2n = ca. 52), G. aurea has the distinction of {{having one of the}} smallest known angiosperm genome size at 63.6 Mbp. The smallest individual chromatids from mitotic anaphase are just 2.1 Mbp and therefore have a size smaller than some bacterial chromosomes, such as the approximate 4 Mbp of Escherichia coli. Genlisea tuberosa has the smallest known angiosperm genome as of 2014 at around 61 Mbp.|$|E
25|$|Ethylene is {{perceived}} {{by a family}} of five transmembrane protein dimers such as the ETR1 protein in Arabidopsis. The genes encoding ethylene receptors have been cloned in the reference plant <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> and many other plants. Ethylene receptors are encoded by multiple genes in plant genomes. Dominant missense mutations {{in any of the}} gene family, which comprises five receptors in Arabidopsis and at least six in tomato, can confer insensitivity to ethylene. Loss-of-function mutations in multiple members of the ethylene-receptor family result in a plant that exhibits constitutive ethylene responses. DNA sequences for ethylene receptors have also been identified in many other plant species and an ethylene binding protein has even been identified in Cyanobacteria.|$|E
25|$|Versteeg et al. also {{concluded}} that, {{contrary to}} Lerchers analysis, the transcription levels of many genes in RIDGEs (for example a cluster on chromosome 9) can vary strongly between different tissues. Lee et al. (2003) analyzed {{the trend of}} gene clustering between different species. They compared Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Homo sapiens, Caenorhabditis elegans, <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> and Drosophila melanogaster, and found a degree of clustering, as fraction of genes in loose clusters, of respectively (37%), (50%), (74%), (52%) and (68%). They concluded that pathways of which the genes are clusters across many species are rare. They found seven universally clustered pathways: glycolysis, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, ATP synthase, DNA polymerase, hexachlorocyclohexane degradation, cyanoamino acid metabolism, and photosynthesis (ATP synthesis in non plant species). Not surprisingly these are basic cellular pathways.|$|E
25|$|RNA-Seq {{refers to}} the {{sequencing}} of transcript cDNAs, where abundance {{is derived from the}} number of counts from each transcript. The technique has therefore been heavily influenced by the development of high-throughput sequencing technologies. Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) was an early example based on generating 16-20bp sequences via a complex series of hybridisations, and was used in 2004 to validate the expression of 104 genes in <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana.</b> The earliest RNA-Seq work was published in 2006 with 105 transcripts sequenced using the 454 technology. This was sufficient coverage to quantify relative transcript abundance. RNA-Seq began to increase in popularity after 2008 when new Solexa/Illumina technologies allowed 109 transcript sequences to be recorded. This yield is now sufficient for accurate quantitation of entire human transcriptomes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> is {{an annual}} (rarely biennial) plant, usually growing to 20–25cm tall. The leaves form a rosette {{at the base}} of the plant, with a few leaves also on the {{flowering}} stem. The basal leaves are green to slightly purplish in color, 1.5–5cm long and 2–10mm broad, with an entire to coarsely serrated margin; the stem leaves are smaller and unstalked, usually with an entire margin. Leaves are covered with small, unicellular hairs (called trichomes). The flowers are 3mm in diameter, arranged in a corymb; their structure is that of the typical Brassicaceae. The fruit is a siliqua 5–20mm long, containing 20–30 seeds. Roots are simple in structure, with a single primary root that grows vertically downward, later producing smaller lateral roots. These roots form interactions with rhizosphere bacteria such as Bacillus megaterium.|$|E
25|$|Several miRNA {{modifications}} affect miRNA stability. As {{indicated by}} {{work in the}} model organism <b>Arabidopsis</b> <b>thaliana</b> (thale cress), mature plant miRNAs appear to be stabilized {{by the addition of}} methyl moieties at the 3' end. The 2'-O-conjugated methyl groups block the addition of uracil (U) residues by uridyltransferase enzymes, a modification that may be associated with miRNA degradation. However, uridylation may also protect some miRNAs; the consequences of this modification are incompletely understood. Uridylation of some animal miRNAs has been reported. Both plant and animal miRNAs may be altered by addition of adenine (A) residues to the 3' end of the miRNA. An extra A added to the end of mammalian miR-122, a liver-enriched miRNA important in hepatitis C, stabilizes the molecule and plant miRNAs ending with an adenine residue have slower decay rates.|$|E
