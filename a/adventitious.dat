5|$|For <b>adventitious</b> protection, {{an animal}} uses {{materials}} such as twigs, sand, or pieces of shell to conceal its outline, for example when a caddis fly larva builds a decorated case, or when a decorator crab decorates its back with seaweed, sponges and stones.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the pioneers}} of {{research}} into animal coloration, Edward Bagnall Poulton classified the forms of protective coloration, {{in a way which}} is still helpful. He described: protective resemblance; aggressive resemblance; <b>adventitious</b> protection; and variable protective resemblance. These are covered in turn below.|$|E

5|$|Many tall palms are {{herbaceous}} monocots; {{these do}} not undergo secondary growth and never produce wood. In many tall palms, the terminal bud {{on the main}} stem {{is the only one}} to develop, so they have unbranched trunks with large spirally arranged leaves. Some of the tree ferns, order Cyatheales, have tall straight trunks, growing up to , but these are composed not of wood but of rhizomes which grow vertically and are covered by numerous <b>adventitious</b> roots.|$|E
5|$|Most ground-living cacti {{have only}} fine roots, which spread {{out around the}} base of the plant for varying distances, close to the surface. Some cacti have taproots; in genera such as Copiapoa, these are {{considerably}} larger and of a greater volume than the body. Taproots may aid in stabilizing the larger columnar cacti. Climbing, creeping and epiphytic cacti may have only <b>adventitious</b> roots, produced along the stems where these come into contact with a rooting medium.|$|E
5|$|The pale brown-skinned ovoid {{tunicate}} bulbs have a membranous {{tunic and}} a corky stem (base or basal) plate from which arise the <b>adventitious</b> root hairs {{in a ring}} around the edge, which grow up to 40mm in length. Above the stem plate is the storage organ consisting of bulb scales, surrounding the previous flower stalk and the terminal bud. The scales are of two types, true storage organs and the bases of the foliage leaves. These have a thicker tip and a scar from where the leaf lamina became detached. The innermost leaf scale is semicircular only partly enveloping the flower stalk (semisheathed).(see Hanks Fig 1.3). The bulb may contain a number of branched bulb units, each with two to three true scales and two to three leaf bases. Each bulb unit has a life of about four years.|$|E
5|$|The {{root system}} and the shoot system are interdependent – the usually non{{photosynthetic}} root system depends on the shoot system for food, and the usually photosynthetic shoot system depends on water and minerals from the root system. Cells in each system are capable of creating cells of the other and producing <b>adventitious</b> shoots or roots. Stolons and tubers are examples of shoots that can grow roots. Roots that spread out close to the surface, {{such as those of}} willows, can produce shoots and ultimately new plants. In the event that one of the systems is lost, the other can often regrow it. In fact it is possible to grow an entire plant from a single leaf, {{as is the case with}} Saintpaulia, or even a single cell – which can dedifferentiate into a callus (a mass of unspecialised cells) that can grow into a new plant.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adventitious</b> roots arise out-of-sequence {{from the}} more usual root {{formation}} of branches of a primary root, and instead originate from the stem, branches, leaves, or old woody roots. They commonly occur in monocots and pteridophytes, but also in many dicots, such as clover (Trifolium), ivy (Hedera), strawberry (Fragaria) and willow (Salix). Most aerial roots and stilt roots are <b>adventitious.</b> In some conifers <b>adventitious</b> roots can form the largest part of the root system.|$|E
25|$|According to Namkhai Norbu, {{all five}} of these, body (sku), voice (gsung), mind (thugs), qualities (yon tan), {{activities}} (phrin las), constitute a mindstream or 'continuum of being' of either a sentient being (with <b>adventitious</b> obscurations) or a buddha (without <b>adventitious</b> obscurations).|$|E
25|$|Root tubers are perennating organs, {{thickened}} {{roots that}} store nutrients over periods when the plant cannot actively grow, thus permitting survival from {{one year to}} the next. The massive enlargement of secondary roots typically represented by Sweet Potato (Ipomoea batatas), have the internal and external cell and tissue structures of a normal root, they produce <b>adventitious</b> roots and stems which again produce <b>adventitious</b> roots.|$|E
25|$|Stilt roots: {{these are}} <b>adventitious</b> support roots, common among mangroves. They grow down from lateral branches, {{branching}} in the soil.|$|E
25|$|Propagative roots: {{roots that}} form <b>adventitious</b> buds that develop into {{aboveground}} shoots, termed suckers, which form new plants, as in Canada thistle, cherry and many others.|$|E
25|$|Vegetative {{propagation}} of plants via cuttings depends on <b>adventitious</b> root formation. Hundreds {{of millions of}} plants are propagated via cuttings annually including chrysanthemum, poinsettia, carnation, ornamental shrubs and many houseplants.|$|E
25|$|Preparation of {{injectable}} {{medications and}} intravenous solutions for fluid replacement therapy requires not only sterility but also well-designed containers to prevent entry of <b>adventitious</b> agents after initial product sterilization.|$|E
25|$|The nodes {{hold one}} or more leaves, as well as buds which can grow into {{branches}} (with leaves, conifer cones, or inflorescences (flowers)). <b>Adventitious</b> roots may also be produced from the nodes.|$|E
25|$|P. {{carolina}} is most {{commonly found in}} the eastern United States from Nebraska to Texas and along the Atlantic coast from New York to Florida. It has also been recorded as an <b>adventitious</b> species in Ontario, Canada, and was introduced to Bermuda.|$|E
25|$|The {{plant is}} capable of {{recruitment}} by rhizomes, making the current individuals clones. However, the plant has also been observed to resprout from <b>adventitious</b> buds {{from the base of}} the stems and seeds. New growth can be stimulated by physical damage to the plant.|$|E
25|$|According to the Nyingma and Sakya schools, tathāgatagarbha is the inseparability of {{the clarity}} and {{emptiness}} of one's mind. According to the Jonang school, {{it refers to}} the innate qualities of the mind which expresses itself in terms of omniscience etc. when <b>adventitious</b> obscurations are removed.|$|E
25|$|Louis's eldest son, Louis II, succeeded him in Vaud, and his {{daughter}} Blanche made an <b>adventitious</b> match to a nephew of Otho de Grandison. This match was arranged in May 1303 at Paris, and the sons of Pierre II de Grandison and Blanche later served the Count of Savoy.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species of}} {{crawling}} plants can also sprout <b>adventitious</b> roots, {{but are not}} considered stoloniferous: a stolon is sprouted from an existing stem and can produce a full individual. Examples of plants that extend through stolons include some species from the genera Argentina (silverweed), Cynodon, Fragaria, and Pilosella (Hawkweeds), Zoysia japonica, Ranunculus repens.|$|E
25|$|In botany, stolons are stems which grow at {{the soil}} surface or just below ground that form <b>adventitious</b> roots at the nodes, and new plants from the buds. Stolons are often called runners. Rhizomes, in contrast, are root-like stems that may either grow {{horizontally}} at {{the soil surface}} or in other orientations underground. Thus, not all horizontal stems are called stolons. Plants with stolons are called stoloniferous.|$|E
25|$|Auxins promote root initiation. Auxin induces both {{growth of}} {{pre-existing}} roots and <b>adventitious</b> root formation, i.e., branching of the roots. As more native auxin is transported down the stem to the roots, the overall {{development of the}} roots is stimulated. If the source of auxin is removed, such as by trimming the tips of stems, the roots are less stimulated accordingly, and growth of stem is supported instead.|$|E
25|$|If any {{of these}} {{symptoms}} are observed, veterinary advice should be sought. The veterinarian will usually auscultate (listen to the horse's chest with a stethoscope) to attempt to detect <b>adventitious</b> lung sounds. If these are very quiet, a rebreathing bag may be used - a plastic bag over the nose to intensify the horse's respiratory effort and hence the sounds. This procedure can be dangerous {{and should not be}} attempted by non-professionals.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adventitious</b> {{ideas are}} those {{concepts}} that we gain through sense experiences, ideas {{such as the}} sensation of heat, because they originate from outside sources; transmitting their own likeness rather than something else and something you simply cannot will away. Ideas invented by us, such as those found in mythology, legends, and fairy tales are created by us from other ideas we possess. Lastly, innate ideas, such as our ideas of perfection, are those ideas we have {{as a result of}} mental processes that are beyond what experience can directly or indirectly provide.|$|E
25|$|Monocotyledonous {{plants have}} two {{additional}} {{structures in the}} form of sheaths. The plumule is covered with a coleoptile that forms the first leaf while the radicle is covered with a coleorhiza that connects to the primary root and <b>adventitious</b> roots form from the sides. Here the hypocotyl is a rudimentary axis between radicle and plumule. The seeds of corn are constructed with these structures; pericarp, scutellum (single large cotyledon) that absorbs nutrients from the endosperm, plumule, radicle, coleoptile and coleorhiza—these last two structures are sheath-like and enclose the plumule and radicle, acting as a protective covering.|$|E
25|$|Pseudotsuga macrocarpa, {{has several}} {{features}} to tolerate and survive wildfire, notably the very thick bark, {{and the presence}} of numerous <b>adventitious</b> buds on the upper side of the branches; this enables the trees to survive even crown fires which burn off all the branchlets, the apparently dead trees becoming green again the following spring. Wildfire frequencies in the chaparral habitats in which it often grows typically range from 15-50 year intervals. Bigcone Douglas-fir is closely associated with canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis) and often establishes itself in its shade; after about 50 years, it emerges above the oak canopy.|$|E
25|$|Redwoods often grow {{in areas}} prone to flooding. Deposits of {{sediment}} following floods can form impermeable barriers which suffocate tree roots, and the unstable soil {{in flooded areas}} often causes trees to lean to one side, increasing their chance to be toppled over by wind. Immediately after a flood, redwoods grow their existing roots upwards into recently deposited sediment layers. A second root system then develops from <b>adventitious</b> buds on the newly buried trunk and the old root system dies. To counter lean, redwoods will increase wood production on their vulnerable side, creating a supporting buttress. These adaptations create forests of almost exclusively redwood trees in flood-prone regions.|$|E
25|$|In {{his style}} of painting, Mr. Aikman seems to have aimed at imitating nature in her {{pleasing}} simplicity: his lights are soft, his shades mellow, and his colouring mild and harmonious. His touches have neither the force nor harshness of Rubens; nor does he seem, like Reynolds, ever to have aimed at adorning his portraits with the elegance of <b>adventitious</b> graces. His mind, tranquil and serene, delighted rather to wander with Thomson in the enchanting fields of Tempe, than to burst, with Michelangelo, into the ruder scenes of the terrible and the sublime. His compositions are distinguished by a placid tranquility and ease rather than a striking brilliancy of effect: and his portraits may be more readily mistaken for those of Kneller than any other eminent artist; {{not only because of}} the general resemblance in the dresses, which were those of the times, they being contemporaries, but also for the manner of working, and the similarity and bland mellowness of their tints.|$|E
500|$|Ficus aurea {{is used as}} an {{ornamental}} tree, {{an indoor}} tree and as a bonsai. Like other figs, it tends to invade built structures and foundations, {{and need to be}} removed to prevent structural damage. Although young trees are described as [...] "rather ornamental", older trees are considered to be difficult to maintain (because of the <b>adventitious</b> roots that develop off branches) and are not recommended for small areas. However, it was considered a useful tree for [...] "enviroscaping" [...] to conserve energy in south Florida, since it is [...] "not as aggressive as many exotic fig species," [...] although it must be given enough space.|$|E
500|$|Some critics, however—including Edgar Allan Poe—felt {{that while}} Irving {{should be given}} credit for being an innovator, the writing itself was often unsophisticated. [...] "Irving is much over-rated", Poe wrote in 1838, [...] "and a nice {{distinction}} might be drawn between his just and his surreptitious and <b>adventitious</b> reputation—between what {{is due to the}} pioneer solely, and what to the writer". A critic for the New-York Mirror wrote: [...] "No man in the Republic of Letters has been more overrated than Mr. Washington Irving". Some critics noted especially that Irving, despite being an American, catered to British sensibilities and, as one critic noted, wrote [...] "of and for England, rather than his own country".|$|E
500|$|The root {{systems of}} most Drosera are often only weakly developed. Serving mainly to absorb water and to anchor {{the plant to}} the ground, the roots are {{relatively}} useless for nutrient uptake. A few South African species use their roots for water and food storage. Some species have wiry root systems that remain during frosts if the stem dies. Some species, such as D. adelae and D. hamiltonii, use their roots for asexual propagation, by sprouting plantlets along their length. Some Australian species form underground corms for this purpose, which also serve to allow the plants to survive dry summers. The roots of pygmy sundews are often extremely long in proportion to their size, with a 1-cm (0.4-in) plant extending roots over [...] beneath the soil surface. Some pygmy sundews, such as D. lasiantha and D. scorpioides, also form <b>adventitious</b> roots as supports. [...] D. intermedia and D. rotundifolia {{have been reported to}} form arbuscular mycorrhizae, which penetrate the plant's tissues.|$|E
2500|$|Descartes {{proposed}} {{that there are}} three types of ideas: Innate, Fictitious, and <b>Adventitious.</b> [...] Innate ideas are and have always been within us, fictitious or invented ideas come from our imagination, and <b>Adventitious</b> ideas come from experiences of the world. [...] He argues that the idea of God is Innate and placed in us by God, and he rejected the possibility that the idea of God is Invented or <b>Adventitious.</b>|$|E
