40|$|This paper {{examines}} if {{the value}} relevance of pension accounting information has increased after {{the implementation of}} IAS 19 R and its removal of the corridor method, requiring all firms with defined benefit pension plans utilising the corridor method to recognise previously disclosed <b>actuarial</b> <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> in the financial statement. With a sample of 185 Scandinavian firms and 370 firm-year observations for 2012 (disclosure year) and 2013 (recognition year) we perform two separate stock-price regressions (one recognition model and one recognition versus disclosure model). The recognition model tests if value relevance has increased for the balance sheet during the first full recognition year of IAS 19 R and our recognition versus disclosure model tests whether recognised <b>actuarial</b> <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> are more value relevant than when they are disclosed. Our results indicate that previously disclosed pension amounts {{in the form of}} <b>actuarial</b> <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> increases the value relevance of the balance sheet when they are recognised. However, there is {{no significant difference between the}} valuation of this pension amount by investors whether it is disclosed or recognised. Therefore, even though our recognition test suggests an increase in value relevance, we can not conclude that the value relevance of pension accounting information has increased for the average investor after the implementation of IAS 19 R or that higher accounting quality is achieved through more transparent financial information. ...|$|E

Enligt pensionsredovisningsforskningen finns samband mellan pensionsredovisningsmetoder och volatilitet i total Eget kapital. Enligt Amir skapar redovisning av aktuariella vinster och förluster mot Eget kapital (totalresultatet) upphov till volatilitet i Eget kapital. Syftet med uppsatsen är att undersöka om forskningen som påvisar detta samband även stöds gällande Large Cap bolagen i Nasdaq OMX Nordic Stockholm. Stämmer det att bolag som redovisar {{pensioner}} mot Eget kapital (totalresultatet) påvisar större volatilitet i Eget kapital än bolag som använder andra pensionsredovisningsmetoder? Detta är den grundläggande problemställningen i uppsatsen. Metod: För att svara på syftet använder vi oss av bolagens årsredovisningar där vi undersöker vilka pensionsredovisningsmetoder bolagen väljer och volatilitet i total Eget kapital mellan åren 2006 - 2011. Dessa värden sammanställs i Excel och testas i statistikprogrammet SPSS. Resultat och Slutsatser: Hypotesprövningen visar att det inte föreligger samband mellan volatilitet i Eget kapital utifrån de olika pensionsredovisningsmetoderna. Vår slutsats är att bolag inom Nasdaq OMX Nordic Stockholm som redovisar aktuariella vinster och förluster i Eget kapital (totalresultat) inte visar större volatilitet i Eget kapital än bolag som använder andra pensionsredovisningsmetoder. Purpose:  According {{to research}} done in pension accounting, {{there is a}} connection between pension accounting methods and volatility in shareholders equity. Amir claims that full recognition of <b>actuarial</b> <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> in the balance sheet creates volatility in shareholders equity. The aim of the paper is to examine whether this connection between pension accounting and volatility can be confirmed among companies in Nasdaq OMX Nordic, Stockholm.  Method: The volatility in Shareholders Equity is examined by researching the annual reports of the companies. Throughout the study, the statistics program SPSS is used.  Analysis: Companies that use full recognition of <b>actuarial</b> <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> in the balance sheet are compared to firms that use other pension accounting methods. The level of volatility in shareholders equity among firms that use full recognition of <b>actuarial</b> <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> are compared to firms that use other pension accounting methods. The aim is to examine whether companies that use full recognition of <b>actuarial</b> <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> show more volatility in share holders equity. Conclusion: According to our study, there is no relationship between pension accounting methods and volatility in shareholders equity. Companies in Nasdaq OMX Nordic Stockholm that recognize <b>actuarial</b> <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> directly to the comprehensive income in shareholders equity and debts does not show more volatility in shareholders equity than firms that use other pension accounting methods. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Authors:Stefan Harrå and Magnus Björk Advisor: Markku Penttinen Title: Accounting Consequences of {{the change}} in pension {{accounting}} Background to problem: When the revised IAS 19 comes into force January 1, 2013, it means that two of the three accounting principles for defined benefit pension plans are disappearing, including the corridor method. The corridor method has made it possible for companies to defer its <b>actuarial</b> <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses.</b> Now that the corridor approach abolished then the unrecognized <b>actuarial</b> <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> immediately be covered by equity, which involves very large amounts of some companies. Why the amounts have grown so big is much because of the discount rate. The discount rate is a controversial parameter, and there is disagreement on how it should be fixed. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to examine the accounting implications this will have for the company applied the corridor method, and if there is some parameters in the actuarial assumption that is more important than others. Methodology: The thesis has mainly been based on a qualitative research through qualitative interviews with a small sample that is affected by this change. There are quantitative elements to a greater depth by examining the annual reports, discount and deferred pension liabilities of the various companies. The approach is exploratory as it is a qualitative study and there was little knowledge of the subject before the work of it started. Therefore, a study of literature, regulations and previous research before the empirical study. This made it possible to gain a broader understanding of the subject and to shape relevant and essential interview questions. Conclusions: The conclusion shows that the largest accounting consequences for the companies in the study in conjunction with the change is that the unrecognized <b>actuarial</b> <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> will now be covered by equity and that the expected return on plan assets is based on the discount rate. The study also shows that it is the discount rate which is considered the most important parameter that the companies are looking at in the actuarial assumption. The conclusion also provides a shared sense of the true and fair picture of the companies after the revised IAS 19. Suggestions for further research: That after 2013 to study how the actual result of this rule change did this compare to the expected. Look at the problem of determining the discount rate. How will the IASB look at it if more and more begin to deviate from the standard?

40|$|The authors {{consider}} efficient {{methods of}} amortizing <b>actuarial</b> <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> in defined-benefit pension plans. In {{the context of}} a simple model where asset gains and losses emerge as a consequence of random (independent and identically distributed) rates of investment return, {{it has been shown that}} direct amortization of such gains and losses leads to more variable funding levels and contribution rates, compared with an indirect and proportional form of amortization that “spreads ” the gains and losses. Stochastic simulations are performed and they indicate that spreading remains more efficient than amortization with simple AR(1) and MA(1) rates of return. Similar results are obtained when a more comprehensive actuarial stochastic investment model (which includes economic wage inflation) is simulated. Proportional spreading is rationalized as the contribution control that optimizes mean square deviations in the contributions and fund levels when the funding process is Markovian and the fund is invested in two assets (a random risky and a risk-free asset). Efficient spreading and amortization periods are suggested for the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada...|$|E
40|$|We {{focus on}} {{accounting}} for unfunded defined benefit pension plans according to IAS 19 {{and compare the}} option to recognise any actuarial gain or loss immediately outside profit or loss in a separate statement within equity ('equity approach') with the 'corridor approach'. The objective is to detect systematic differences in long-term pure accounting effects, which {{can be seen by}} the different cumulated net-amounts not (yet) recognised in profit or loss. Due to the complexity and the probabilistic elements, human expectations on system behaviour often fail. Therefore, we have performed the first Monte-Carlo-simulation study of the accounting options. The assumptions concerning input data are based on official German statistics and, therefore, are representative at least for Germany and similar countries. As a result, the belief of long-term offsetting of cumulated <b>actuarial</b> <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> is not accurate. The former unforeseeable consequences are the following: if we apply the equity approach we identify a tendency for a quasi-permanent cumulated actuarial net-gain (regenerating workforce) or a permanent cumulated actuarial net-loss (degenerating workforce) recognised outside profit or loss. If the corridor approach is applied, a tendency for quasi-permanent cumulated unrecognised net-gains is reported while amortising any corridor excess {{in the case of a}} regenerating workforce. ...|$|E

40|$|The Malaysian Accounting Standard Board ‘MASB’ issued FRS 119 ‘Employee Benefits’ {{which became}} {{effective}} for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010. This standard is further superseded by MFRS 119 (i. e. {{as amended by}} IASB in June 2011) with effect from 1 January 2013. Hence, the present study provides evidence on the practice of pension accounting disclosures after the implementation of FRS 119 ‘Employee Benefits’ and their stock market reactions ‘cumulative market adjusted return’. The study reveals that seventy (70) companies have adopted Defined Benefit (DB) pension schemes based on the annual reports for the year 2009. Among these companies, seven (7) companies have pension assets disclosures while another 63 companies pension liabilities disclosures. The pension accounting disclosures related to <b>actuarial</b> <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> are only provided by 29 Malaysian companies. In addition, multivariate analysis provides interesting results that indicate pension liabilities disclosures are significant variables in relation to CMAR. These findings may suggest that DB pension schemes with high disclosures of pension liabilities are less likely contributing to high value of CMAR. In this context, the users of corporate financial statements could be expected (1) to value the amount of pension liabilities more than amount of pension assets among DB pension schemes adopters; and (2) higher amount of pension liabilities may result in lower CMAR among DB pension schemes adopters in Malaysia. On the other hand, pension assets disclosures which are positively and significantly associated to CMAR indicate that the higher of pension assets disclosed in by DB pension adopters in the financial statements, the higher of CMAR will be offered by Malaysian listed companies. These disclosures of pension asset could help the aging population in planning the retirement needs in the future. In addition, users of financial statements may be worth to be attentive and watchful {{in relation to the}} amount of pension assets which are disclosed in the annual reports in order to make decision on buying and selling of company securities...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the economic {{consequences of the}} adoption of international pension accounting standard IAS 19 Revised (IAS 19 R) on pension asset allocation decisions by applying a difference-in-differences with propensity score matching method. The publication of IAS 19 R in 2011 marked a fundamental change to pension reporting in financial statements. In particular, it {{had a significant impact}} on (1) how sponsor firms recognise net pension assets/liabilities on the balance sheet, (2) the calculation and recognition of pension expenses, (3) the presentation of re-measurement (<b>actuarial</b> <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses),</b> treatment of which had been heavily debated by academics and practitioners, and (4) disclosure requirements for pension schemes, which had been criticised as “excessive” under IAS 19. This research {{examines the}} “real effect” of IAS 19 R adoption on management investment decisions. Using a difference-in-differences with propensity score matching method, the results suggest that, on average, UK sponsor firms affected by IAS 19 R have reduced their risk taking in pension investments post-IAS 19 R, both over time and compared with a control sample of unaffected US firms (matched by propensity score matching). The results of sensitivity analysis also suggest that UK sponsor firms tried to avoid the expensive liquidity costs of asset re-allocation by switching their pension plan asset allocations gradually during the period around the publication and adoption of IAS 19 R. Furthermore, the outcomes of sensitivity tests suggest a positive relationship between equity investment levels, and firms’ leverage and cash flow risk, consistent with the “risk-shifting” hypothesis documented in the previous literature. The thesis also applies a manual textual analysis on the comment letters sent by industrial firms to the IASB to provide their opinions on the IAS 19 R Exposure Draft. The analysis describes and tabulates the arguments raised by these firms on three main amendment areas of IAS 19 : recognition, presentation and disclosure. Based on this description, this part aims to motivate the empirical research mentioned previously and shed light on the other potential consequences of IAS 19 R adoption. These consequences include: the management of funding might be driven by accounting rules rather than management rules; the increasing volatility of balance sheet; de-risking in the pension plan portfolio following the adoption of IAS 19 R; the diminishing of financial statement “true and fair view” and its usefulness due to the abolition of expected rate of return and excessive requirements on pension disclosure. Furthermore, the study also suggests that the lobbying behaviour of these firms on the standard setting process is consistent with the predictions of Positive Accounting Theory...|$|E

Previous reconstructions of intron <b>gain</b> <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> events during eukaryotic evolution {{used a variety of}} simplified evolutionary models that yielded contradicting conclusions and are not suited to reveal some of the key underlying processes. We combine a comprehensive probabilistic model and an extended data set, including 391 conserved genes from 19 eukaryotes, to uncover previously unnoticed aspects of intron evolution—in particular, to assign intron <b>gain</b> <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> rates to individual genes. The rates of intron <b>gain</b> <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> in a gene show moderate positive correlation. A gene’s intron gain rate shows a highly significant negative correlation with the coding-sequence evolution rate; intron loss rate also significantly, but positively, correlates with the sequence evolution rate. Correlations of the opposite signs, albeit less significant ones, are observed between intron <b>gain</b> <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> rates <b>and</b> gene expression level.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the existence and}} stability of solitons in a χ^(2) coupler. Both the fundamental and second harmonics undergo gain {{in one of the}} coupler cores and are absorbed in the other one. The <b>gain</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> are balanced creating a parity-time (PT) symmetric configuration. We present two types of families of PT-symmetric solitons, having equal and different profiles of the fundamental and second harmonics. It is shown that <b>gain</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> can stabilize solitons. Interaction of stable solitons is shown. In the cascading limit the model is reduced to the PT-symmetric coupler with effective Kerr-type nonlinearity <b>and</b> balanced nonlinear <b>gain</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses...</b>|$|R
