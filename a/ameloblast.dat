5000|$|Tomes' {{processes}} are a histologic landmark identified on an <b>ameloblast,</b> cells {{involved in the}} production of tooth enamel. During the synthesis of enamel, the <b>ameloblast</b> moves away from the enamel, forming a projection surrounded by the developing enamel.

50|$|Each <b>ameloblast</b> is a {{columnar}} cell approximately 4 micrometers in diameter, 40 micrometers {{in length}} and is hexagonal in cross section. The secretory end of the <b>ameloblast</b> ends in a six-sided pyramid-like projection known as the Tomes' process. The angulation of the Tomes' process is significant in the orientation of enamel rods, the basic unit of tooth enamel.Distal terminal bars are junctional complexes that separate the Tomes' processes from <b>ameloblast</b> proper.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ameloblasts</b> are cells which secrete the enamel {{proteins}} enamelin and amelogenin {{which will}} later mineralize to form enamel, the hardest substance {{in the human}} body. <b>Ameloblasts</b> control ionic and organic compositions of enamel. It is theorized that a circadian clock (24-hour) probably regulates enamel production on a daily cycle by the <b>ameloblasts</b> (similar to osteoblasts in production of bone tissue). <b>Ameloblasts</b> adjust their secretory and resorptive activities to maintain favorable conditions for biomineralization.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{morphology}} and function of maturation <b>ameloblasts,</b> kitten tooth germs were examined using an ultrastructural tracer technique. Kitten maturation <b>ameloblasts</b> {{were divided into two}} cell types: a ruffle-ended type showing plasma membrane infoldings and invaginations at the distal cell surface and a smooth-ended type showing a non-invaginated, smooth distal cell surface. Both <b>ameloblasts</b> possessed two sets of junctional complexes at their proximal and distal ends. In either type of cell, intravenously injected horseradish peroxidase penetrated from the vascular region into the developing enamel surface through both the proximal and distal junctional complexes, although the tight junction compartment inhibited horseradish peroxidase permeation. Ruffle-ended <b>ameloblasts</b> further incorporated peroxidase from the distal cell surface into the cytoplasm by means of membrane invaginations and coated vesicles. Smooth-ended <b>ameloblasts</b> showed little intracellular peroxidase incorporation. These results show clearly that resorptive and non-resorptive maturation <b>ameloblasts</b> exist in kitten enamel organ and that the two cell types correspond to ruffle-ended and smooth-ended maturation <b>ameloblasts</b> in rat incisors...|$|R
40|$|Tooth {{morphogenesis}} {{results from}} reciprocal interactions between oral epithelium and ectomesenchyme {{culminating in the}} formation of mineralized tissues, enamel, and dentin. During this process, epithelial cells differentiate into enamel-secreting <b>ameloblasts.</b> Ameloblastin, an enamel matrix protein, is expressed by differentiating <b>ameloblasts.</b> Here, we report the creation of ameloblastin-null mice, which developed severe enamel hypoplasia. In mutant tooth, the dental epithelium differentiated into enamel-secreting <b>ameloblasts,</b> but the cells were detached from the matrix and subsequently lost cell polarity, resumed proliferation, and formed multicell layers. Expression of Msx 2, p 27, and p 75 were deregulated in mutant <b>ameloblasts,</b> the phenotypes of which were reversed to undifferentiated epithelium. We found that recombinant ameloblastin adhered specifically to <b>ameloblasts</b> and inhibited cell proliferation. The mutant mice developed an odontogenic tumor of dental epithelium origin. Thus, ameloblastin is a cell adhesion molecule essential for amelogenesis, and it plays a role in maintaining the differentiation state of secretory stage <b>ameloblasts</b> by binding to <b>ameloblasts</b> and inhibiting proliferation...|$|R
50|$|The body of {{the cell}} between the {{processes}} first deposits enamel, which will become {{the periphery of the}} enamel prisms,then the tomes process will infill the main {{body of the}} enamel prism. More than one <b>ameloblast</b> contributes to a single prism.|$|E
50|$|Linear enamel {{hypoplasia}} (LEH) is {{a developmental}} dental deficiency that indicates {{the lack of}} thickness of enamel. LEHs are caused by periodic physiological disturbance to enamel matrix secretion during people at young age when teeth are growing. In archaeological researches, teeth are well preserved in the fossil remains and enamel is the hardest tissue of the human body, which is not easily to be destroyed. Mature human dental enamel {{is made up of}} 96% inorganic material (crystalline hyproxypaite),which is not likely to decay through time, and only contents 2% water and 2% protein. <b>Ameloblast</b> cells form hard outermost layers for enamel forming surface crowns. Any systematic disturbance that disrupts the <b>ameloblast</b> cells processing the enamel in human early age, alters the direction of movement. If the <b>ameloblast</b> cells do not recover from a disturbance, these ameloblasts cells will stop forming further enamel and results in enamel hypoplasia. There are four types of enamel hypoplasia: pits, vertical grooves, missing enamel and horizontal grooves and horizontal grooves presenting a single sharp line on the crown surface is commonly regarded as linear hypoplasia. The mark of teeth due to enamel hypolasia is permanent, since EH is formed in the premature time of teeth and teeth is not likely to change or decay after it gets matured.|$|E
5000|$|Amelogenesis is {{considered}} to have three stages. [...] The first stage {{is known as the}} inductive stage, the second is the secretory stage, and the third stage is known as the maturation stage. During the inductive stage, <b>ameloblast</b> differentiation from IEE is initiated. Proteins and an organic matrix form a partially mineralized enamel in the secretory stage.

40|$|A freeze-fracture {{examination}} of distal portions of differentiating and secretory <b>ameloblasts</b> {{was carried out}} using upper molar tooth germs from one to four days old rats. Ultrathin sections were prepared for comparison. Freeze-fracture provides {{a unique opportunity to}} observe plasma membrane events in distal portions of <b>ameloblasts</b> during differentiation and development. Our results suggest that the distal plasma membrane and Tomes' processes of differentiating and secretory <b>ameloblasts</b> are highly active in endocytosis. In differentiating <b>ameloblasts,</b> endocytic activity is likely to be associated with removal of the basal lamina. During matrix secretion and maturation, <b>ameloblasts</b> are probably removing material from the maturing matrix; in particular amelogenins and water. The present study provides morphological evidence that an endosomal system is present in differentiating and secretory <b>ameloblasts</b> during periods of endocytic activity. This would provide a system whereby ligands, fluid components, membrane receptors and plasma membrane, which enter the cells during endocytosis, may be separated from each other and sorted out for despatch to different destinations...|$|R
40|$|Enamel biomineralization {{results in}} a release of protons into the enamel matrix, causing an {{acidification}} of the local microenvironment. This acidification, which may be enhanced by more rapid mineral deposition {{in the presence of}} fluoride, must be neutralized by the overlying <b>ameloblasts.</b> The electrogenic sodium bicarbonate co-transporter NBCe 1 has been localized in mouse <b>ameloblasts,</b> and has been proposed to have a role in matrix pH regulation. In this study, transcript analysis by PCR showed NBCe 1 -A present in human <b>ameloblasts,</b> whereas mouse <b>ameloblasts</b> expressed NBCe 1 -B. In situ hybridization and qPCR in mouse and fetal human incisors showed that NBCe 1 mRNA was up-regulated as <b>ameloblasts</b> differentiated. Ingestion of 50 ppm fluoride resulted in an up-regulation of NBCe 1 mRNA in maturation-stage mouse <b>ameloblasts</b> in vivo, as compared with controls. NBCe 1 expression was up-regulated by low pH, but not by fluoride, in human ameloblast-lineage cells in vitro. The up-regulation of NBCe 1 in vivo as enamel maturation and mineralization progressed provides evidence that NBCe 1 participates in pH modulation during enamel formation. Up-regulation of NBCe 1 in fluorosed maturation <b>ameloblasts</b> in vivo, with no effect of fluoride in vitro, supports the hypothesis that fluoride-enhanced mineral deposition {{results in a}}cidification of the mineralizing enamel matrix...|$|R
50|$|The {{differentiation}} {{phase of}} the Induction stage is initiated {{by the presence of}} newly formed predentin. The IEE cells then elongate and become preameloblasts. There is a shift in polarity. Each preameloblast elongates and becomes an postmitotic, polarized, secretory <b>ameloblast.</b> However, there are no Tomes' process yet. It is at this stage that a signal is sent from the newly differentiated ameloblasts back across the dentinoenamel junction (DEJ) to stimulate dentinogenesis.|$|E
50|$|The reduced enamel epithelium, {{sometimes}} called reduced dental epithelium, overlies a developing tooth and is formed by two layers: {{a layer of}} <b>ameloblast</b> cells and the adjacent layer of cuboidal cells (outer enamel epithelium) from the dental lamina. As {{the cells of the}} reduced enamel epithelium degenerate, the tooth is revealed progressively with its eruption into the mouth. The degeneration of reduced enamel epithelium also mediates the initial epithelial attachment to the tooth.|$|E
50|$|Primary enamel cuticle, {{also called}} Nasmyth's {{membrane}}, is thin membrane of tissue {{also known as}} reduced enamel epithelium (REE) produced by the <b>ameloblast,</b> that covers the tooth once it has erupted. This tissue is primarily basal lamina. It is usually worn away by mastication and cleaning. The primary enamel cuticle protects enamel from resorption by cells of the dental sac and also secretes desmolytic enzymes for elimination of the dental sac, allowing fusion between reduced enamel epithelium and oral epithelium. This process allows eruption of the tooth without bleeding.|$|E
25|$|In the {{maturation}} stage, the <b>ameloblasts</b> transport {{some of the}} substances used in enamel formation out of the enamel. Thus, {{the function}} of <b>ameloblasts</b> changes from enamel production, as occurs in the secretory stage, to transportation of substances. Most of the materials transported by <b>ameloblasts</b> in this stage are proteins used to complete mineralization. The important proteins involved are amelogenins, ameloblastins, enamelins, and tuftelins. By {{the end of this}} stage, the enamel has completed its mineralization.|$|R

40|$|Enamel-producing cells (ameloblasts) {{pass through}} several {{phenotypic}} and functional stages during enamel formation. In the transition between secretory and maturation stages, about {{one quarter of}} the ameloblasts suddenly undergo apoptosis. We have studied this phenomenon using the continuously erupting rat incisor model. A special feature of this model is that all stages of <b>ameloblast</b> differentiation are presented within a single longitudinal section of the developing tooth. This permits investigation of the temporal sequence of gene and growth factor receptor expression during <b>ameloblast</b> differentiation and apoptosis. We describe the light and electron microscopic morphology of <b>ameloblast</b> apoptosis and the pattern of insulin-like growth factor- 1 receptor expression by ameloblasts in the continuously erupting rat incisor model. In the developing rat incisor, <b>ameloblast</b> apoptosis is associated with downregulated expression of the insulin-like growth factor- 1 receptor. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that ameloblasts are hard wired for apoptosis and that insulin-like growth factor- 1 receptor expression is required to block the default apoptotic pathway. Possible mechanisms of insulin-like growth factor- 1 inhibition of <b>ameloblast</b> apoptosis are presented. The rat incisor model may be useful in studies of physiological apoptosis as it presents apoptosis in a predictable pattern in adult tissues...|$|E

40|$|Maturation stage <b>ameloblasts</b> of rodents express vacuolar type-H-ATPase in the ruffled {{border of}} their plasma {{membrane}} {{in contact with}} forming dental enamel, similar to osteoclasts that resorb bone. It has been proposed that in <b>ameloblasts</b> this v-H-ATPase acts as proton pump to acidify the enamel space, required to complete enamel mineralization. To examine whether this v-H-ATPase in mouse <b>ameloblasts</b> is a proton pump, we determined whether these cells express the lysosomal, T-cell, immune regulator 1 (Tcirg 1, v-H-Atp 6 v 0 a 3), which {{is an essential part}} of the plasma membrane proton pump that is present in osteoclasts. Mutation of this subunit in Tcirg 1 null (or oc/oc) mice leads to severe osteopetrosis. No immunohistochemically detectable Tcirg 1 was seen in mouse maturation stage <b>ameloblasts.</b> Strong positive staining in secretory and maturation stage <b>ameloblasts</b> however was found for another subunit of v-H-ATPase, subunit b, brain isoform (v-H-Atp 6 v 1 b 2). Mouse osteoclasts and renal tubular epithelium stained strongly for both Tcirg 1 and v-H-Atp 6 v 1 b 2. In Tcirg 1 null mice osteoclasts and renal epithelium were negative for Tcirg 1 but remained positive for v-H-Atp 6 v 1 b 2. The bone in these mutant mice was osteopetrotic, tooth eruption was inhibited or delayed, and teeth were often morphologically disfigured. However, enamel formation in these mutant mice was normal, <b>ameloblasts</b> structurally unaffected and the mineral content of enamel similar to that of wild type mice. We concluded that Tcirg 1, which is essential for osteoclasts to pump protons into the bone, is not appreciably expressed in maturation stage mouse <b>ameloblasts.</b> Our data suggest that the reported v-H-ATPase in maturation stage <b>ameloblasts</b> is not the typical osteoclast-type plasma membrane associated proton pump which acidifies the extracellular space, but rather a v-H-ATPase potentially involved in intracellular acidification...|$|R
40|$|Dental {{fluorosis}} {{is characterized}} by subsurface hypomineralization and increased porosity of enamel, associated with a delay in the removal of enamel matrix proteins. To investigate the effects of fluoride on <b>ameloblasts,</b> A/J mice were given 50 ppm sodium fluoride in drinking water for four weeks, resulting serum fluoride levels of 4. 5 µM, a four-fold increase over control mice with no fluoride added to drinking water. MicroCT analyses showed delayed and incomplete mineralization of fluorosed incisor enamel as compared to control enamel. A microarray analysis of secretory and maturation stage <b>ameloblasts</b> microdissected from control and fluorosed mouse incisors showed that genes clustered with Mmp 20 appeared to be less downregulated in maturation stage <b>ameloblasts</b> of fluorosed incisors as compared to control maturation <b>ameloblasts.</b> One of these Mmp 20 co-regulated genes was the global chromatin organizer, special AT-rich sequence-binding protein- 1 (SATB 1). Immunohistochemical analysis showed increased SATB 1 protein present in fluorosed <b>ameloblasts</b> compared to controls. In vitro, exposure of human ameloblast-lineage cells to micromolar levels of both NaF and AlF 3 led to a significantly increase in SATB 1 protein content, but not levels of Satb 1 mRNA, suggesting a fluoride-induced mechanism protecting SABT 1 from degradation. Consistent with this possibility, we used immunohistochemistry and Western blot to show that fluoride exposed <b>ameloblasts</b> had increased phosphorylated PKCα both in vivo and in vitro. This kinase is known to phosphorylate SATB 1, and phosphorylation is known to protect SATB 1 from degradation by caspase- 6. In addition, production of cellular diacylglycerol (DAG) was significantly increased in fluorosed <b>ameloblasts,</b> suggesting that the increased phosphorylation of SATB 1 {{may be related to}} an effect of fluoride to enhance Gαq activity of secretory <b>ameloblasts...</b>|$|R

In this study we systematically characterized the expression pattern of TGF-b 2 in vivo and further analyzed its possible roles during different developmental stages of mouse first lower molar using immunofluorescence histochemical method with confocal microscopy. TGF-b 2 signaling was detected in different developing stages in both dental epithelium and surrounding dental mesenchyme.

40|$|The {{transport}} of mineral ions from the enamel organ-associated blood vessels {{to the developing}} enamel crystals involves complex cargo packaging and carriage mechanisms across several cell layers, including the <b>ameloblast</b> layer and the stratum intermedium. Previous studies have established PHOSPHO 1 as a matrix vesicle membrane-associated phosphatase that interacts with matrix vesicles molecules phosphoethanolamine and phosphocholine to initiate apatite crystal formation inside of matrix vesicles in bone. In the present study, we sought to determine the function of Phospho 1 during amelogenesis. PHOSPHO 1 protein localization during amelogenesis was verified using immunohistochemistry, with positive signals in the enamel layer, <b>ameloblast</b> Tomes' processes, and in the walls of <b>ameloblast</b> secretory vesicles. These <b>ameloblast</b> secretory vesicle walls were also labeled for amelogenin and the exosomal protein marker HSP 70 using immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, PHOSPHO 1 presence in the enamel organ was confirmed by Western blot. Phospho 1 −/− mice lacked sharp incisal tips, featured a significant 25 % increase in total enamel volume, and demonstrated a significant 2 -fold reduction in silver grain density of von Kossa stained ground sections indicative of reduced mineralization in the enamel layer when compared to wild-type mice (p < 0. 001). Scanning electron micrographs of Phospho 1 −/− mouse enamel revealed a loss of the prominent enamel prism “picket fence” structure, a loss of parallel crystal organization within prisms, and a 1. 56 -fold increase in enamel prism width (p < 0. 0001). Finally, EDS elemental analysis demonstrated {{a significant decrease in}} phosphate incorporation in the enamel layer when compared to controls (p < 0. 05). Together, these data establish that the matrix vesicle membrane-associated phosphatase PHOSPHO 1 is essential for physiological enamel mineralization.

Several transcription factors are candidates for enamel gene expression regulation and thus the control of enamel quality. Some of these factors, such as MSX 2, are mainly confined to the dental epithelium. MSX 2 homeoprotein controls several stages of the <b>ameloblast</b> life cycle. This chapter introduces MSX 2 and its target genes in the <b>ameloblast</b> and provides an overview of knowledge regarding its effects in vivo in transgenic mouse models.
