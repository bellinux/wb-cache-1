25|$|In 2004, Urban Institute economists C. Eugene Steuerle and Adam Carasso {{created a}} Web-based Social Security {{benefits}} calculator. The calculator {{does not include}} the value or cost of the Social Security disability program. Using this calculator it is possible to estimate net Social Security benefits (i.e., estimated lifetime benefits minus estimated lifetime FICA taxes paid) for different types of recipients. In the book Democrats and Republicans – Rhetoric and Reality Joseph Fried used the calculator to create graphical depictions of the estimated net benefits {{of men and women who}} were at different wage levels, single and married (with stay-at-home spouses), and retiring in different years. These graphs vividly show that generalizations <b>about</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> benefits may be of little predictive value for any given worker, due to the wide disparity of net benefits for people at different income levels and in different demographic groups. For example, the graph below (Figure 168) shows the impact of wage level and retirement date on a male worker. As income goes up, net benefits get smaller – even negative.|$|E

Gilmore thanked the questioner {{on the basis that}} he believed the [...] "Middle East issue" [...] should be looked at beyond Iraq. He stated that as president he would join with American allies to put [...] "serious mandatory sanctions" [...] on the regime to let them know [...] "that it is better for them to give up this sort of plan (Nuclear proliferation)." [...] After receiving a question <b>about</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security,</b> Gilmore changed the subject to address his record of cutting taxes as Governor of Virginia. He would later attack fellow candidates: Rudy Giuliani for his pro-choice positions, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee for his record on taxes, and Mitt Romney for his position on health care. When asked about potential terrorist attacks, Gilmore reminded the audience that he was governor when The Pentagon was attacked on 9/11 and that he has [...] "the experience to deal with these issues." [...] At the end of the debate, Gilmore addressed the issue of race when asked why no minorities where present on the stage running for the presidency, he reacted to this question by declaring that the Republican Party has [...] "people that are prepared to [...] in the immediate future". He also cited his own credentials on race stating that as attorney general of Virginia he faced the issue when he {{had to deal with the}} burning of African-American churches, which gave him a good standing with the African-American community in his own judgment.|$|E

50|$|Against a {{backdrop}} of intensifying public debate in the late 1970s <b>about</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security’s</b> long-term solvency, a 1981 article by Chen {{was the first to}} call attention to the implications of proliferating employee fringe benefits for the solvency of <b>Social</b> <b>Security.</b> This work helped guide financing discussions throughout the <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> “crisis debates” of the 1980s.Chen’s 1980 introductory <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> text discussed the implications of changing family patterns for the benefit structure of <b>Social</b> <b>Security.</b> It pointed out that the largely static (and therefore outdated) <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> benefit structure leaves the most financially vulnerable people—often women, minorities, and children—with increasingly less or no protection.

Thomas Paine, one of our Founders, had said, 'If there is to be trouble, let it be in my day, so that my child may have peace.' What he meant way back then was that there should be an expectation that some sacrifices will have to be made, in our generation, so that future generations can have the opportunities that we've had to grow and thrive and prosper, so that our private sector can do what a private sector does best in creating jobs. So, yeah, with some practical things that have to be made, some decisions here, with perhaps changing, in future years, not adversely affecting those who are reliant on retirement benefits today, for instance, Social Security benefits, but changing, perhaps, the eligibility in future years. That has to be something that we're brave enough, courageous enough, to start talking about." ...|$|E

The <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> Trust Fund will not delay the onset of <b>Social</b> <b>Security's</b> problems. The critics are equally mistaken about individual accounts. Individual accounts do not involve simply switching investments from bonds to stocks. There would be no reduction in survivors' or disability benefits.

Finally, benefits {{under the current system}} are not guaranteed, but workers would have a property right to the funds in their individual accounts...|$|R

Anxieties about Europe and migration are linked with fears of a clash of civilizations and anxieties <b>about</b> <b>social</b> <b>securities.</b> <b>Social</b> discontent, fuelled by socio-economic changes, has undermined the traditional sources of identity around class and the nation, releasing xenophobic and nationalistic currents. Fear of others and anxieties about the future have emerged as potent social forces in contemporary society.

40|$|Most {{citizens}} {{know little}} about politics. Scholars often attribute political ignorance to individual-level factors, but we concentrate {{on the quality of}} the information environment. Employing a combination of experimental methods and content analysis, we code statements from the 1998 - 1999 debate over <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> reform as either misleading or not misleading. Then, using surveys conducted during the debate, we examine the impact of individual- and environmental-level variables on political knowledge about the program’s future. We show that misleading statements <b>about</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security’s</b> future cause some citizens to get an important fact about the program wrong. More precisely, many citizens mistakenly believe that <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> will run out of money because political elites occasionally use words that lead to overly pessimistic assessments of the program’s financial future. Our findings have important implications for policymakers attempting to remake America’s largest federal program, scholars studying citizen competence, and citizens in a representative democracy. According to Philip Converse, two “simple truths ” characterize the distribution of political information in the United States: the mean is low and the variance is high (1990, 372). Whereas low and uneven levels of political knowledge often are attributed to individual-level factors, such as the unwillingness of citizens to front the cost of acquiring information (Down...|$|R
