[...] The standard could be a cell filled with a solvent such as distilled water or a prepared solvent of a known concentration.

Traditionally, EM wave <b>absorbing</b> <b>materials,</b> which are composed of magnetic metals or alloys particles, are restricted in application because of high specific gravity and formulation difficulty. It is hence desirable to have microwave <b>absorbing</b> <b>materials</b> that are lightweight, structurally sound, and flexible and show good microwave-absorbing ability in a wide frequency range. In terms of these criteria, one-dimensional nanostructures, which have a tremendous surface area and more dangling bond atoms on surface, appear to be good candidates [3]. Recently, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [4 – 6], magnetic-particle-doped CNTs [7], magnetic nanowires (NWs) [8], nanostructured ZnO [9, 10], and Mn 3 O 4 [11] were intensively studied and found to be promising microwave <b>absorbing</b> <b>materials.</b> Many groups found ZnO nanomaterials with different morphologies show excellent microwave absorption behavior, and partly attributed to its semiconductor character [9, 10, 12].

This means that a solid object in air or in a vacuum, or a significant change in atomic density between the object and what is surrounding it, will usually scatter radar (radio) waves from its surface.

The probability of Compton scattering decreases with increasing photon energy. Compton scattering is thought to be the principal absorption mechanism for gamma rays in the intermediate energy range 100 keV to 10 MeV.

30|$|Rockburst {{ultimately}} {{leads to}} the sudden violent dynamic failures of roadway or coalface, of which 87  % (Pan et al. 2013) occurs in the roadway. Therefore, it is of direct significance for the control of rockburst by inhibiting the failure of roadway and coalface through support means. As for rockburst-resisting roadways, the support system should be capable of resisting high burst dynamics, providing appropriate pressure yielding deformation, and owning a flexibility that can play a buffering and energy-absorbing role (Gao et al. 2009). Bolt has become a reasonable supporting mean due to its initiative, pressure yielding ability, energy absorbing ability, and the capability in utilizing the bearing capacity of surrounding rocks (Gao et al. 2009; He et al. 2010). However, bolt support technology can only resist the rockburst under certain intensity. As for high-energy rockburst, energy <b>absorbing</b> <b>materials</b> are needed to consume part of the tremor energy to stabilize the support system (Lv et al. 2011). On this basis, Pan and Lv et al. (Pan et al. 2011; Lv and Pan 2012) proposed a structure model of rigid-flexible energy-absorbing support which was composed of surrounding rocks, energy <b>absorbing</b> <b>materials,</b> and steel bracket (rigid-flexible-rigid). In essence, the model {{is similar to the}} strong–soft–strong structure model (Gao et al. 2008). The surrounding rocks, energy <b>absorbing</b> <b>materials,</b> and steel bracket are equivalent to the externally strong large structure, middle soft structure, internally strong small structure respectively. Theoretically basing on the model above, the rigid-flexible energy-absorbing support system (Liu et al. 2013) was developed. It is a three-level support system composed of three parts, namely, the bolt-mesh-cable support, the O-type roof support made of energy <b>absorbing</b> <b>materials</b> and U-type steels (simply called as O-type roof support), and the rigid burst-resisting bracket. The energy <b>absorbing</b> <b>materials</b> lay between the bolt-mesh-cable support and O-type roof support. This support system was implemented in Yuejin Coal Mine of Henan Dayou Energy Co., Ltd., China, and effectively avoided roadway damages, equipment damages, and casualties when high-energy rockburst occurred.|$|R

50|$|A microbolometer {{consists}} of an array of pixels, each pixel being made up of several layers. The cross-sectional diagram shown in Figure 1 provides a generalized view of the pixel. Each company that manufactures microbolometers has their own unique procedure for producing them and they even {{use a variety of}} different absorbing materials. In this example the bottom layer {{consists of}} a silicon substrate and a readout integrated circuit (ROIC). Electrical contacts are deposited and then selectively etched away. A reflector, for example, a titanium mirror, is created beneath the IR <b>absorbing</b> <b>material.</b> Since some light is able to pass through the absorbing layer, the reflector redirects this light back up to ensure the greatest possible absorption, hence allowing a stronger signal to be produced. Next, a sacrificial layer is deposited so that later in the process a gap can be created to thermally isolate the IR <b>absorbing</b> <b>material</b> from the ROIC. A layer of <b>absorbing</b> <b>material</b> is then deposited and selectively etched so that the final contacts can be created. To create the final bridge like structure shown in Figure 1, the sacrificial layer is removed so that the <b>absorbing</b> <b>material</b> is suspended approximately 2 μm above the readout circuit. Because microbolometers do not undergo any cooling, the <b>absorbing</b> <b>material</b> must be thermally isolated from the bottom ROIC and the bridge like structure allows for this to occur. After the array of pixels is created the microbolometer is encapsulated under a vacuum to increase the longevity of the device. In some cases the entire fabrication process is done without breaking vacuum.|$|E
