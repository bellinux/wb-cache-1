50|$|In May 2006, First York {{became the}} first bus {{operator}} in the UK to introduce Volvo B7L/Wright StreetCars {{as part of the}} FTR scheme being trialed in the city. Eleven <b>articulated</b> <b>StreetCars</b> operated on route 4, which links the University of York, the City Centre and Acomb. Each bus carried 42 seated and 71 standing passengers.|$|R
2500|$|Each Portland {{streetcar}} is [...] long, whereas Portland's MAX {{cars are}} [...] long, and streetcars are operated as single cars at all times, never coupled into trains. The shorter cars keeps station construction expense lower {{than would be}} the case for a light-rail station, but the smaller cars do not provide equal carrying capacity as that of a light-rail train; a single <b>articulated</b> Portland <b>streetcar</b> is only about one-third the length of a two-car MAX train.|$|R
50|$|First Cymru {{operate a}} bus rapid {{transport}} route between Singleton Hospital, Swansea University, Swansea City Centre and Morriston Hospital as Swansea Metro. On 28 August 2015 the fleet of Wright <b>StreetCar</b> <b>articulated</b> buses that operated the service {{were replaced by}} conventional buses and had lost the FTRmetro branding.|$|R
50|$|Since December 2009, {{the three}} Inekon streetcars were in storage at Metro's Greenbelt Rail Yard. Each car is 8 ft wide and 66 ft long, and each car {{consists}} of three connected sections, a design known as an <b>articulated</b> <b>streetcar.</b>|$|E
50|$|After {{the system}} was abandoned, most of the cars were either {{destroyed}} or sold. Several hundred cars were scrapped, cut in half at the center door and junked. 101 of the streetcars were sold to Barcelona where some continued in service until 1971 71 more were sold to Sarajevo where they ran until 1983 {{and some of them}} were used for construction of the only 9 <b>articulated</b> PCC <b>streetcars</b> ever; and 15 more went to Fort Worth, TX for use on the Tandy Center Subway until it shut down in 2002.|$|R
5000|$|FTR is a British rapid-transit bus system, {{currently}} in operation in Leeds and formerly in Luton, Swansea and York. FirstGroup introduced the system, using 39 Wright <b>StreetCar</b> <b>articulated</b> buses {{in conjunction with}} infrastructure upgrades by local authorities. The vehicles were branded as [...] "the future of travel", the operators claiming that ftr is Abjadic textspeak for the word future.|$|R
5000|$|Each Portland {{streetcar}} is 66 ft long, whereas {{light rail}} cars are typically 80 to 95 ft long (Portland's Lightrail are between 80 and 95 ft. long) and streetcars are operated as single cars at all times, never coupled into trains. The shorter cars keeps station construction expense lower {{than would be}} the case for a light-rail station, but the smaller cars do not provide equal carrying capacity as that of a light-rail train. A single <b>articulated</b> Portland <b>streetcar</b> is only about one-third the length of a two-car Lightrail Trains. It can be assumed that the Minneapolis streetcars would follow similar design standards or acquire ex-Twin City Rapid Transit PCC streetcars from Newark City Subway.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Wheeled {{mobility}} devices (WhMD) pose unique safety {{risks to}} users while riding public transportation. Unsecured or improperly secured WhMDs create safety concerns for other transit riders and operators. Tests using accelerometers and visual observations {{were conducted to}} understand how WhMD orientation and securement in <b>articulated</b> buses, <b>streetcars,</b> and light rail vehicles. These tests used manual wheelchairs and lightweight scooters. The rail study focuses on WhMD orientation. The rail research activity determined that longitudinal and side facing orientation for WhMD performed similarly but due to other on board safety factors longitudinal is the safer option. The bus study focused on the combination of vertical and horizontal roadway curvature and the effect on a rear facing passive containment system. The research determined that the passive rear facing containment system was appropriate when drivers maintained trained operating speed or lower while traversing the complex curvature...|$|R
50|$|Bus routes within Swansea are {{operated}} predominantly by First Cymru, while smaller bus {{and coach}} operators such as NAT Group, South Wales Transport, Lewis Coaches, First Call Travel and DANSA also operate some routes in the city, {{most of which}} serving Swansea bus station. First operates the Swansea Metro, a road-based FTR bus rapid transit route, introduced between Morriston Hospital and Singleton Hospital in 2009, and a shuttle bus (Service X10) to Cardiff Central bus station calling at Bridgend Designer Outlet. In late 2015 the fleet of Wright <b>StreetCar</b> <b>articulated</b> buses that served the Swansea Metro route were removed from service and replaced with standard non-articulated Wright StreetLite vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|Swansea {{gained a}} similar {{operation}} from 1 June 2009 with FTRs running on route 4 in a phased introduction over several months. The service, publicised as ftrmetro, links Morriston Hospital, Morriston, the City Centre and the University/Singleton Hospital, with five services per hour through the daytime. Extensive streetworks {{were carried out}} along the route, including segregated running through the city centre and an [...] "express route" [...] by-passing the busy residential streets of Hafod. The fleet of Wright <b>StreetCar</b> <b>articulated</b> vehicles were removed from Swansea on 28 August 2015; First Cymru cited refurbishment costs as a key factor. Although the articulated vehicles were removed from service, the same route is now served by standard single-deck Wright StreetLite buses and other similar vehicles.|$|R
