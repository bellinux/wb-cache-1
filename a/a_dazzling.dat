The monk, interpreting this phenomenon as a sign of celestial power, went to the spot where the brilliance of light had formed. There he found a pond on which he began to pray.|$|E

25|$|Sir Philip Sidney made verse {{versions}} of the first 43 psalms. After he died in 1586, his sister, Mary Sidney Herbert, the Countess of Pembroke, completed the translation of the final two-thirds of the psalter. Together they used <b>a</b> <b>dazzling</b> array of stanza forms and rhyme schemes—as many as 145 different forms for the 150 psalms. The Sidney Psalter was not published in its complete form until the twentieth century, but it was widely read in manuscript, and influenced such later poets as John Donne and George Herbert.|$|E
25|$|The Ibis is an elegiac poem in 644 lines, {{in which}} Ovid uses <b>a</b> <b>dazzling</b> array of mythic stories to curse and attack an enemy who is harming him in exile. At the {{beginning}} of the poem, Ovid claims that his poetry up to that point had been harmless, but now he is going to use his abilities to hurt his enemy. He cites Callimachus' Ibis as his inspiration and calls all the gods to make his curse effective. Ovid uses mythical exempla to condemn his enemy in the afterlife, cites evil prodigies that attended his birth, and then in the next 300 lines wishes that the torments of mythological characters befall his enemy. The poem ends with a prayer that the gods make his curse effective.|$|E
25|$|The {{anonymous}} (Currer Bell) {{publication in}} 1847 of Jane Eyre, An Autobiography, established <b>a</b> <b>dazzling</b> reputation for Charlotte. In July 1848, Charlotte and Anne (Emily {{had refused to}} go along with them) travelled by train to London to prove to Smith, Elder & Co. that each sister was indeed an independent author, for Thomas Cautley Newby, the publisher of Wuthering Heights and Agnes Grey, had launched a rumour that the three novels were the work of one author, understood to be Ellis Bell (Emily). George Smith was extremely surprised to find two gawky, ill-dressed country girls paralysed with fear, who, to identify themselves, held out the letters addressed to Messrs. Acton, Currer and Ellis Bell. Taken by such surprise, he introduced them to his mother with all the dignity their talent merited, and invited them to the opera for a performance of Rossini's Barber of Seville.|$|E

25|$|The {{two full}} weeks of festivities were devised in meticulous detail by Lord Curzon, Viceroy of India. It was <b>a</b> <b>dazzling</b> display of pomp, power and split second timing. Neither the earlier Delhi Durbar of 1877, nor the later Durbar held there in 1911, could match the pageantry of Lord Curzon’s 1903 festivities. In {{a few short}} months {{at the end of}} 1902, a deserted plain was {{transformed}} into an elaborate tented city, complete with temporary light railway to bring crowds of spectators out from Delhi, a post office with its own stamp, telephone and telegraphic facilities, a variety of stores, a Police force with specially designed uniform, hospital, magistrate’s court and complex sanitation, drainage and electric light installations. Souvenir guide books were sold and maps of the camping ground distributed. Marketing opportunities were craftily exploited. A special Delhi Durbar Medal was struck, firework displays, exhibitions and glamorous dances held.|$|E
25|$|The Miu Fat Buddhist Monastery {{was first}} {{constructed}} in 1950. Over {{the following two}} decades came {{the construction of the}} 3-storey Ten Thousand Buddhas Hall at a cost of $60 million. It took six years to complete, with its consecration ceremony held in May 1980. The Mahavira Hall, located on the top storey, has a floor height of about 20 metres. In the middle of the Hall, there are three gold-plated statues of the Buddha Sakyamuni, each of them is about 5-metre tall. Its interior walls are adorned with over 10 thousands of Buddha reliefs and a number of murals featuring a blend of Sino-Thai cultures, which are so magnificent and eye-catching. Higher up in the Hall are the Library of Buddhist Scriptures and the Attic of the Jade Buddha. On each side of the main entrance of the Hall is a 20-metre column carved with <b>a</b> <b>dazzling</b> lifelike giant gold-scaled dragon, making the building prominently imposing. The Monastery also has a kitchen serving mouthwatering vegetarian food for visitors.|$|E
25|$|Frik du Preez is {{probably}} the greatest Northerns hero of all heroes. The Springbok lock and flank was not only <b>a</b> <b>dazzling</b> player on the field, but was equally popular off the field. Together with his close friend, Mof Myburgh, both played a total of 109 matches for the Northern Transvaal. Du Preez and Myburgh were inseparable, and Myburgh also {{proved to be a}} hero of note. Despite being rather short for a lock, Du Preez's line-out work was practically unequalled and his powerful sprints struck fear in the hearts of his opposition, while he also kicked for posts for the Springboks and Northern Transvaal and put away some magnificent drop goals. How popular he was, even outside Pretoria, is apparent from {{the fact that he was}} carried, shoulder high, off the field after his last game at Newlands in Cape Town in a match that Northerns won by 25-14. Frik retired at the end of the 1971 season. Du Preez was nominated by the magazine SA Rugby as the South African player of the century, and was the first South African to be honoured, along with Dr Danie Craven, in the International Hall of Fame in Auckland, New Zealand.|$|E

25|$|He toured Australia for 1950-51 Ashes series as vice-captain, {{the first}} {{professional}} in the 20th century {{to be awarded}} the position, but had a dismal tour because of a recurring knee problem caused by an old football injury. He averaged only 7.57 in the Tests, but 92.11 in his other first-class matches. He became the first professional to captain the MCC for an entire game, Jack Hobbs having taken over from the injured Arthur Carr in 1924–25. He and Len Hutton made the winning runs in the Fifth Test at Melbourne, the first time Australia had been beaten since 1938. Compton as well jointly captained Middlesex between 1951 and 1952, with W.J. Edrich. Also in 1952, Compton scored his 100th first-class century against Northampton while featuring for Middlesex at.Lords. On the 1954–55 tour his departure was delayed for a remedial operation on his knee and he joined the team in Australia by aeroplane. In the First Test at Brisbane he badly cut his hand when he hit a billboard while fielding and batted {{at the bottom of}} the order. He missed the Second Test. He came third in the England Test averages (38.20), but topped the tour averages (57.07) and made three centuries. In his last Test against Australia in 1956 he made <b>a</b> <b>dazzling</b> 94 despite having just had his right kneecap removed.|$|E
25|$|Her brother, Philip Sidney, wrote {{much of his}} Arcadia in her presence, at Wilton House. He {{also likely}} began {{preparing}} his English lyric version of the Book of Psalms at Wilton as well. He had completed 43 of the 150 Psalms {{at the time of}} his death during a military campaign against the Spanish in the Netherlands in 1586. She finished his translation of the Psalms, composing Psalms 44-150 in <b>a</b> <b>dazzling</b> array of verse forms, using the 1560 Geneva Bible and commentaries by John Calvin and Theodore Beza. Hallett Smith has called the psalter a “School of English Versification”: of one hundred and seventy-one poems (Psalm 119 is a gathering of twenty-two separate poems), the verse psalter only replicates the formal structure of a poem, its rhyme scheme and meter, three times. A copy of the completed psalter was prepared for Queen Elizabeth I in 1599, in anticipation of a royal visit, but Elizabeth canceled her planned visit to Wilton. This work is usually referred to as “The Sidney Psalms” or “The Sidney-Pembroke Psalter” and is regarded as an important influence on the development of English religious lyric poetry in the late 16th and early 17th century. John Donne wrote a poem celebrating the verse psalter, and claiming that he could “scarce” call the English Church reformed until its psalter had been modeled after the poetic transcriptions of Philip Sidney and Mary Herbert.|$|E

Paris Saint-Germain scored through Christophe Jallet after the regulation 90 {{minutes for the}} fourth game running to salvage a draw at Caen. Paris Saint-Germain missed {{the opportunity to go}} back to the top of the Ligue 1 table when they were held at home by Bordeaux. Paris Saint-Germain suffered a first Ligue 1 defeat in 15 outings as Nancy won over the title pretenders. Paris Saint-Germain centre-half Alex scored the winner as PSG beat Marseille at the Parc des Princes. Anthony Le Tallec scored a late equaliser to secure a draw for Auxerre against Paris Saint-Germain. Inspired by <b>a</b> <b>dazzling</b> performance from Nenê, PSG got back to winning ways in emphatic fashion with a win over relegation-threatened Sochaux. Eden Hazard was once again outstanding as Lille came from behind to beat ten-man Paris Saint-Germain. Paris Saint-Germain moved to within three points of leaders Montpellier as Nenê and Javier Pastore gave the capital club a win over Saint-Étienne. PSG came back from two goals down to beat Valenciennes in a thriller in the north of France. A brilliant hat-trick from Nenê and a magnificent performance from Jérémy Ménez handed Paris Saint-Germain a win against Rennes that keeps them in the title running with a game to spare. PSG came from behind to beat Lorient at the Stade du Moustoir but the win was not enough for them to win the Ligue 1 title.|$|E
