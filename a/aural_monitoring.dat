50|$|Although {{setting up}} mist nets is time {{consuming}} and requires certification, {{there are certain}} advantages to visual and <b>aural</b> <b>monitoring</b> techniques, such as sampling species that may be poorly detected in other ways. It also allows easy standardization, hands-on examination, and reduces misidentification of species. Because they allow scientists to examine species up close, mist nets are often used in mark-recapture studies over {{extended periods of time}} to detect trends in population indices (Dunn and Ralph 2004).|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, aural and visual {{monitoring}} of massive people gatherings has become a critical problem of national security. In order to tackle this problem, a fixed infrastructure is used whenever possible. The aim of this thesis is to propose the system for spontaneous “flash crowd” monitoring in areas with no fixed infrastructure. The basic concept is to engage users with their mobile devices {{to participate in the}} monitoring process. The system takes on characteristics of “big data” generators. We analyze the proposed system for coverage metrics and estimate the rate imposed on the wireless network. Our results show that given a certain level of participation the LTE network can support <b>aural</b> <b>monitoring</b> with prescribed guarantees. However, the modern LTE system cannot fully support visual monitoring, as much more capacity is required. This capacity may potentially be provided by forthcoming millimeter wave and terahertz communication systems. The analysis is conducted mainly using own custom-build simulation environment in C programming language to simulate the formalized problem. The processes and experiments run by using many resources to reduce the time consumption due to large number of calculations. And the graphs are sketched from the numerical results by using MATLAB...|$|E
40|$|Background &amp; Aim: Socio-economical {{changes have}} {{increased}} the women's opportunity to take job in recent decades. The increased levels of women in work places, {{has resulted in a}} high interest in the potential adverse effects of work on pregnancy outcome. This study was conducted in order to surveying the association between occupational factors and preterm childbirth. Methods &amp; Materials: It is a cross-sectional study. Samples consisted of nurses and midwives (518 person) who working in Tehran's universities of medical sciences hospitals. Also they delivered newborns in gestational age more than twenty weeks (term or preterm) in years 2001 - 2006. The subjects were selected using a multi stage sampling method. Data gathered using a self-administered questionnaire. Occupational factors labeled as fatigue score and working hours. The relation between Occupational factors and preterm birth was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics (Chi-squared, t-test and Mann-Whitney U test) by SPSS software. Results: Based on the study findings, the prevalence of preterm labor was 17. 2 % (95 %CI= 0. 14 - 0. 20). Although the proportions of unfavorable working conditions include: working at acute clinical wards, standing up more than 3 h per each working shift, physical exercise, working in cold or hot weather, working in busy environment with continuous noise, being checker of visual and <b>aural</b> <b>monitoring</b> signals, working hours equal or more than 40 hours per week, and working fatigue score equal or more than 3 were higher in preterm group; but it didn't show any significant relation with preterm birth. Conclusion: According to the research findings, it seems that occupational factors do not have explicit effect on preterm childbirth. Therefore more investigations are recommended. &nbsp; Key words: Preterm Labor, Occupational Factors, Fatigu...|$|E

In {{addition to}} the standard light bar, the game also features an <b>aural</b> <b>monitor</b> that measures the noise that Sam makes, along with the ambient noise of the environment. It is important for Sam to make less noise than his surroundings; otherwise, the enemy guards will hear him.|$|R
40|$|Robot {{teleoperation}} {{systems have}} been limited in their utility due {{to the need for}} operator motion, lack of portability and limitation to singular input modalities. In this article, the design and construction of a dual-mode human–machine interface system for robot teleoperation addressing all these issues is presented. The interface is capable of directing robotic devices in response to tongue movement and/or speech without insertion of any device {{in the vicinity of the}} oral cavity. The interface is centered on the unique properties of the human ear as an acoustic output device. Specifically, we present: (1) an analysis of the sensitivity of human ear canals as acoustic output device � (2) the design of a new sensor for monitoring airflow in the aural canal� (3) pattern recognition procedures for recognition of both speech and tongue movement by <b>monitoring</b> <b>aural</b> flow across several human test subjects � and (4) a conceptual design and simulation of the machin...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the changes in}} thigh and calf skin blood flow during continuous and intermittent upper body exercise. Methods: Eight healthy able-bodied males undertook a preliminary incremental arm crank ergometry (ACE) test to volitional exhaustion and two experimental trials. Experimental trials consisted of either 28 min of continuous ACE at 50 % peak power (CON) or 28 min intermittent exercise (INT) involving alternating 2 min bouts of ACE at 25 % and 75 % peak power. Changes in skin blood flow were measured by Laser Doppler techniques. Changes in calf volume were measured by strain gauge plethysmography. Heart rate and expired gas were continuously <b>monitored.</b> <b>Aural</b> and skin temperatures were measured. Results: Calf volume decreased in both trials, decreasing {{to a greater extent}} during INT (P< 0. 05). Changes in skin blood flow of the thigh and calf demonstrated intensity dependent increases during INT whereas a more steady state increase was observed during CON. There were no differences in aural temperature between trials. Calf skin temperature decreased in both trials and to a greater extent during INT. Conclusions: Increases in skin blood flow occur concurrently with a decrease in calf volume. Additionally, changes in skin blood flow appear to change rapidly with changes in exercise intensity...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{considers the}} implications of using recordings of free improvisations on world music instruments and other instruments as source material for fixed media musical compositions. Generating material in this way demanded the formulation of new working methods which inevitably impacted on the character and style of the work produced. A methodology was evolved based on aspects of the performance practice of free-jazz improvisation. The individual style of free-jazz improvisation was {{a major part of}} the syntax of the created music. This further enabled novelty in that an improvised based -style replaces the conventional Western reliance on notation and its associated compositional techniques. Rather, sound is generated spontaneously and guided only by <b>aural</b> <b>monitoring</b> of it. A fascination with the sounds of world instruments led to an exploration of the sounds of those instruments in new contexts. Instruments, both world and western classical, became treated as found objects or utilised in ‘studies in ignorance’ in the manner of Sun Ra. 1 The improvised material was then manipulated using computer software and structured into fixed-media works. Gesture, texture and timbre dominate these structures rather than preconceived themes or harmonic schemes. Most of the music presented with the thesis is text based or inspired by text; this provides further structural underpinning. I wished to explore the relationship between the Weird Realist aesthetic as posited by Graham Harman in the works of H. P. Lovecraft and an analogous musical response. The separation of quality from object in Lovecraft chimed with experiences of sensory distortion when under shamanic trance and this resulted in Shamanic Incantation No. 5, the only non-text based work. A fascination with fantasy in general led to the composition of an opera in Klingon in which the text and music combine to present a series of tableaux that hint at aspects of sacred violence and the breakdown of shared values in times of war. As if to underline this point, Grodek No. 4 presents a collage of disturbing materials drawn from stride jazz piano, free improvisation and expressionist sprechgesang; all of which combine in a new context to illuminate Georg Trakl’s poem on the horrors of violence. As a result of these compositional procedures a cogent sound world using improvisation and electronics was created. The influence of Weird Realism and the use of world instruments stimulated ideas about how musical material can be distorted and re-contextualised. The combination of improvisatory and ‘composed’ elements was fruitful and shows a way of working with two different types of intuition, one in real time, the other not. This suggests possibilities for further exploring the combining of different experiential modes in creative work. 1 A key recording in this respect is Sun Ra, Strange Strings, El Saturn 502, 1966, explored later in the thesis...|$|E
