5|$|Early Lingbao ritual {{was mostly}} done on an {{individual}} basis, either in a meditation chamber, or the courtyard of a house. Early practitioners were not professional priests, but rather 'students of the Dao'. Later on, as the Lingbao movement developed religious institutions and an established clergy, ritual practice became more of <b>a</b> <b>communal</b> rite.|$|E

Brashear received six months probation after pleading guilty to common assault.|$|E
5|$|In Rome the portico of the Palazzo dei Conservatori {{sheltered}} {{offices of}} various guilds. Here disputes arising in the transaction of business were adjudicated, {{unless they were}} of sufficient importance to go before <b>a</b> <b>communal</b> tribunal, {{such as that of}} the conservatori. It was a natural place for such activity. Until the 1470s the main market of the city was held on and around the campidoglio, while cattle continued to be taxed and sold in the ancient forum located just to the south.|$|E
5|$|The {{author of}} the Rule of Saint Benedict, which was the {{principal}} monastic code in Western Europe in the early Middle Ages, was Saint Benedict of Nursia (c. 480–550). Under this rule {{the lives of the}} monks were mainly devoted to prayer, together with reading sacred texts and manual work. They lived <b>a</b> <b>communal</b> life and were required to give complete obedience to their abbot. Benedict's achievement was to produce a stable system characterised by moderation and prudence.|$|E

5|$|The main predators of {{the house}} martins are those birds of prey which are capable of {{catching}} these agile fliers, such as the hobby (Falco subbuteo). Birds of the Delichon species are most vulnerable when collecting mud from the ground. This has therefore become <b>a</b> <b>communal</b> activity, {{with a group of}} these birds descending suddenly on a patch of mud. The generally insectivorous collared falconet has been recorded as hunting Nepal house martins.|$|E
5|$|The new {{building}} {{was designed for}} attractiveness and modernity to contrast with the traditional gloomy decor associated with the funeral industry. A narrow four-storey building on Westminster Bridge Road held the LNC's offices. Behind it was the main terminal; this held <b>a</b> <b>communal</b> third-class waiting room, mortuaries and storerooms, the LNC's workshops, and a sumptuous oak-panelled Chapelle Ardente, intended for mourners unable to make the journey to Brookwood {{to pay their respects}} to the deceased. This building led onto the two platforms, lined with waiting rooms and a ticket office.|$|E
5|$|The second kingdom's {{economy was}} based on both {{agriculture}} and trade. The economy was centralized and directed through <b>a</b> <b>communal</b> organization, where grains were stored in communal granaries, and distributed amongst the population according to social statues. The organization also controlled the animal herds in the kingdom. Some people were directly connected to the palace instead of the communal organization, those included the metal and textile producers and the military officials. Ebla was an important trading partner and rival, Mari's position made it an important trading center as it controlled the road linking between the Levant and Mesopotamia.|$|E

5|$|William de Corbeil or William of Corbeil (c. 1070– 1136) was {{a medieval}} Archbishop of Canterbury. Very {{little is known}} of William's early life or his family, except that he was born at Corbeil in the {{outskirts}} of Paris {{and that he had}} two brothers. Educated as a theologian, he taught briefly before serving the bishops of Durham and London as a clerk and subsequently becoming a canon, a priest who lived <b>a</b> <b>communal</b> life. William was elected to the see of Canterbury as a compromise candidate in 1123, the first canon to become an English archbishop. He succeeded Ralph d'Escures, who had employed him as a chaplain.|$|E
5|$|Also defined herewith: seabird colony; {{breeding}} colony; communal roost; heronries; rookery. A large {{congregation of}} individuals {{of one or}} more species of bird that nest or roost in proximity at a particular location. Many kinds of birds are known to congregate in groups of varying size; a congregation of nesting birds is called a breeding colony. A group of birds congregating for rest is called <b>a</b> <b>communal</b> roost. Approximately 13% of all bird species nest colonially. Nesting colonies are very common among seabirds on cliffs and islands. Nearly 95% of seabirds are colonial, leading to the usage, seabird colony, sometimes called a rookery. Many species of terns nest in colonies on the ground. Herons, egrets, storks and other large waterfowl also nest communally in what are called heronries. Colony nesting may be an evolutionary response to a shortage of safe nesting sites and abundance or unpredictable food sources which are far away from the nest sites.|$|E
5|$|Astrology, in its {{broadest}} sense, is {{the search}} for meaning in the sky. Early evidence for humans making conscious attempts to measure, record, and predict seasonal changes by reference to astronomical cycles, appears as markings on bones and cave walls, which show that lunar cycles were being noted as early as 25,000 years ago. This was a first step towards recording the Moon's influence upon tides and rivers, and towards organising <b>a</b> <b>communal</b> calendar. Farmers addressed agricultural needs with increasing knowledge of the constellations that appear in the different seasons—and used the rising of particular star-groups to herald annual floods or seasonal activities. By the 3rd millennium BCE, civilisations had sophisticated awareness of celestial cycles, and may have oriented temples in alignment with heliacal risings of the stars.|$|E

25|$|The {{precursor}} to the racial riots of 1969 occurred in Singapore in 1964, {{which led to the}} expulsion of Singapore from the Federation of Malaysia. The main opposition party, People's Action Party (PAP), called for equality for all Malaysians and challenged the domination of the ruling Alliance coalition in the Federal Government election of 1964. This was known as the 'Malaysian Malaysia' campaign. <b>As</b> <b>communal</b> tension threatened to turn violent, the Federal Government decided to expel Singapore from the Federation of Malaysia.|$|R
5|$|Beeston crag {{is one of}} a {{chain of}} rocky hills {{stretching}} across the Cheshire Plain. Pits dating from the 4thmillennium BC indicate the site of Beeston Castle may have been inhabited or used as <b>a</b> <b>communal</b> gathering place during the Neolithic period. Archaeologists have discovered Neolithic flint arrow heads on the crag, as well as the remains of a Bronze Age community, and of an Iron Age hill fort. The rampart associated with the Bronze Age activity on the crag has been dated to around 1270–830 BC; seven circular buildings were identified as being either late Bronze Age or early Iron Age in origin. It may have been a specialist metalworking site.|$|E
5|$|Communities such as AVEN can be {{beneficial}} to those in search of answers to solve a crisis of identity {{with regard to their}} possible asexuality. Individuals go through a series of emotional processes that end with their identifying with the asexual community. They first realize that their sexual attractions differ from those of most of society. This difference leads to questioning whether the way they feel is acceptable, and possible reasons for why they feel this way. Pathological beliefs tend to follow, in which, in some cases, they may seek medical help because they feel they have a disease. Self-understanding is usually reached when they find a definition that matches their feelings. Asexuality communities provide support and information that allows newly identified asexuals to move from self-clarification to identifying on <b>a</b> <b>communal</b> level, which can be empowering, because they now have something to associate with, which gives normality to this overall socially-isolating situation.|$|E
5|$|In 678, after Wilfrid {{was removed}} from the bishopric of York and banished from Northumbria, the diocese of York was divided into three. Bosa was {{appointed}} to the now greatly reduced diocese of York, which included the sub-kingdom of Deira, thanks to the support of King Ecgfrith of Northumbria and Theodore of Tarsus, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Bosa was consecrated in his cathedral at York in 678 by Theodore, but Wilfrid declared that he was unable to work with Bosa because he did not consider him {{to be a member of}} the Catholic Church. Bosa's episcopate lasted nine years, but with Wilfrid back in favour, in 687 Bosa was removed just as his predecessor had been. He returned to York in 691, after Wilfrid was once again expelled. While bishop, Bosa introduced <b>a</b> <b>communal</b> life for the clergy of the cathedral, and set up a continuous liturgy in the cathedral.|$|E
