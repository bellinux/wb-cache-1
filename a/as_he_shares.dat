During the second season, Ben Jones left the series for a few episodes due to a dispute over whether the character should be clean shaven or have a full beard. In his absence, Cooter's place was filled by several of Cooter's supposed cousins who were never mentioned before or since.

Cooter drives a variety of trucks, including Fords, Chevys, and GMCs. His CB handle is [...] "Crazy Cooter" [...] and he often starts his CB transmissions with [...] "Breaker one, Breaker one, I might be crazy but I ain't dumb, Craaaazy Cooter comin' atcha, come on." ...|$|E
60|$|There is a {{very great}} and obvious {{distinction}} between the general influence which the teacher exerts {{as a member of}} the community, and that which he can employ in his school room as teacher. He has unquestionably a right to exert upon the community, by such means <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>shares</b> in common with every other citizen, as much influence as he can command, for the dissemination of his own political, or religious, or scientific opinions. But the strong ascendency, which, in consequence of his official station, he has obtained over the minds of his pupils, is sacred. He has no right to use it for any purpose foreign to the specific objects for which he is employed, unless by the consent, expressed or implied, of those by whom he is entrusted with his charge. The parents who send their children to him, to be taught to read, to write and to calculate, may have erroneous views of their duty, as parents, in other respects. He may know that their views are erroneous. They may be taking a course, which the teacher knows is wrong. But he has not, on this account, a right to step in between the parent and the child, to guide the latter according to his own opinions, and to violate the wishes and thwart the plans of the former.|$|E
