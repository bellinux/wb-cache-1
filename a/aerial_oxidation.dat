5|$|Complexes of vanadium(II) and (III) are {{relatively}} exchange inert and reducing. Those of V(IV) and V(V) are oxidants. Vanadium ion is rather large and some complexes achieve coordination numbers greater than 6, {{as is the}} case in 4−. Oxovanadium(V) also forms 7 coordinate coordination complexes with tetradentate ligands and peroxides and these complexes are used for oxidative brominations and thioether oxidations. The coordination chemistry of V4+ is dominated by the vanadyl center, VO2+, which binds four other ligands strongly and one weakly (the one trans to the vanadyl center). An example is vanadyl acetylacetonate (V(O)(O2C5H7)2). In this complex, the vanadium is 5-coordinate, square pyramidal, meaning that a sixth ligand, such as pyridine, may be attached, though the association constant of this process is small. Many 5-coordinate vanadyl complexes have a trigonal bypyramidal geometry, such as VOCl2(NMe3)2. The coordination chemistry of V5+ is dominated by the relatively stable dioxovanadium coordination complexes which are often formed by <b>aerial</b> <b>oxidation</b> of the vanadium(IV) precursors indicating the stability of the +5 oxidation state and ease of interconversion between the +4 and +5 states.|$|E
40|$|Thin oxygen-ion-conducting films (5 - 10 mu m) were {{prepared}} and characterized on mixed-conducting porous substrates. When {{this film is}} made of a pure ionic conductor, such as a gadolinia-doped ceria (Ce 0. 8 Gd 0. 2 O 1. 9) electrolyte material, the assembly {{can be used as}} a cathode-supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) for operation at intermediate temperatures (500 - 600 degrees C). In this case, a porous anode comprising a Ni-CGO cermet or a Pt coating is deposited on top of the highly conductive electrolyte. Another structure with promising applications is created when the supported gastight layer includes a mixed conductor such as ferrite or cobaltite perovskites acting as oxygen-permeable membrane, which can be applied in the combustion of fuel with pure oxygen or in the intensification of other industrial processes currently using <b>aerial</b> catalytic <b>oxidation.</b> The different supported films and multilayer assemblies were characterized by SEM, EDS-WDX, SIMS, helium, and oxygen permeation, showing that gastight thin films can be achieved (values > 1 x 10 (- 6) mbar L s(- 1) cm(- 2)) by inexpensive coating procedures (screen-printing or slip-casting). The electrochemical properties of thin CGO electrolytes were studied by impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and DC voltammetry on fully assembled fuel cells. It is concluded that thin CGO electrolytes under hydrogen atmosphere have enough n-type electronic conductivity to reduce the cell potential by 5 - 20 % from the Nernst potential, which causes the consequent power density decrease. A possible solution to these leakage currents is the use of a thin electron-blocking layer as stabilized zirconia (YSZ or SSZ) deposited on the fuel-exposed CGO electrolyte side. Oxygen permeation of thin LSFC layers was measured using air and helium (sweep) in the range from 700 to 1000 degrees C. Supported thin films exhibit much better permeation fluxes than bulk thick membranes, especially when oxygen-reduction catalytic porous coatings were applied...|$|R
40|$|We use asexual {{development}} of Neurospora crassa {{as a model}} system with which to determine the causes of cell differentiation. Air exposure of a mycelial mat induces hyphal adhesion, and adherent hyphae grow aerial hyphae that, in turn, form conidia. Previous work indicated the {{development of}} a hyperoxidant state at the start of these morphogenetic transitions and a large increase in catalase activity during conidiation. Catalase 3 (CAT- 3) increases at the end of exponential growth and is induced by different stress conditions. Here we analyzed the effects of cat- 3 -null strains on growth and asexual development. The lack of CAT- 3 was not compensated by other catalases, even under oxidative stress conditions, and cat- 3 RIP colonies were sensitive to H 2 O 2, indicating that wild-type (Wt) resistance to external H 2 O 2 was due to CAT- 3. cat- 3 RIP colonies grown in the dark produced high levels of carotenes as a consequence of oxidative stress. Light exacerbated oxidative stress and further increased carotene synthesis. In the cat- 3 RIP mutant strain, increased aeration in liquid cultures led to increased hyphal adhesion and protein oxidation. Compared to the Wt, the cat- 3 RIP mutant strain produced six times more aerial hyphae and conidia in air-exposed mycelial mats, as a result of longer and more densely packed <b>aerial</b> hyphae. Protein <b>oxidation</b> in colonies was threefold higher and showed more aerial hyphae and conidia in mutant strains than did the Wt.

These were presumed to be related by a chiral difference at the spiro carbon atom. The pattern of the oxidative process involves a contraction of the pyrimidine ring. It was thought to be analogous to that suggested by other investigators for the oxidation of uric acid, but for which no really definitive evidence had been presented. We have been able now to isolate in a crystalline state one of the diastereomers produced by the <b>aerial</b> <b>oxidation</b> of 8 -phenylaminoguanosine under alkaline conditions. Analysis by X-ray diffraction has now confirmed the type of spiro structure promulgated previously. These findings also imply that spiro compounds are likely to be produced during the <b>aerial</b> <b>oxidation</b> of any 8 -arylaminoguanine nucleoside or 2 '-deoxynucleoside. In addition, this work adds considerable weight to the results of Poje and Sokolic-Maravic who proposed that a spiro intermediate is produced during the <b>aerial</b> <b>oxidation</b> of uric acid (12, 13). However, they found this compound to be unstable to base, in contrast to the arylaminoguanine oxidation products.

DtB 4 HP groups release electron density onto the porphyrin macrocycle more effectively than 4 HP groups, which in turn release electron density more effectively than 3 HP groups; (2) the relative availability to oxygen of DtB 4 HP electron density in the various series of porphyrins¡ (3) the relative ability in certain 4 NP-substituted porphyrins to stabilise unpaired electron density over the macrocycle and its substituents...|$|E
