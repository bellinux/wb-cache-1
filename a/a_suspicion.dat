5|$|There {{had been}} <b>a</b> <b>suspicion</b> that Platoro had {{excavated}} from the San Esteban {{as well as}} the Espíritu Santo, but the analysis of the San Esteban artifacts {{made it clear that the}} Platoro collection all came from Espíritu Santo.|$|E
5|$|As Petty gets {{further into}} his investigation, Rost's answers become more evasive. Petty {{suspects}} that Eric actually kills women for his snuff films, <b>a</b> <b>suspicion</b> further exacerbated when Rost {{says that he}} will relay Petty's contact information to the women instead of giving their contact information to Petty. It is not clear at the film's end whether Rost's films are actual snuff in the fictional subplot's context. However, {{it is known that}} he spies on them {{for a long period of}} time before asking them to participate.|$|E
5|$|On 14August1942, Herring {{was ordered}} to Esk, Queensland, to assume command of II Corps with the {{temporary}} rank of Lieutenant General. As such, {{he was responsible for}} the defence of Brisbane. At this time he was criticised in Federal Parliament by Arthur Calwell for allegedly issuing a verbal order whilst commander of the 6th Division that no officer was to be commissioned unless they had at least attained an Intermediate Certificate. There was no evidence that such an order was ever issued, but the allegation reflected <b>a</b> <b>suspicion</b> that Herring was an elitist.|$|E
50|$|The purpose, therefore, was {{to assist}} the {{investigating}} director to cross the threshold from <b>a</b> mere <b>suspicion</b> that <b>a</b> specified offence had been committed to <b>a</b> reasonable <b>suspicion,</b> which was <b>a</b> prerequisite for the holding of an inquiry.|$|R
60|$|And {{with its}} long rows of {{port-hole}} casements, each revealing {{the muzzle of}} a cannon, a man-of-war resembles a three-story house in <b>a</b> <b>suspicions</b> part of the town, with a basement of indefinite depth, and ugly-looking fellows gazing out at the windows.|$|R

5|$|The {{mistrust of}} Standard Oil was {{partially}} {{the result of}} <b>a</b> <b>suspicion</b> toward carpetbaggers, which ironically was also the source of skepticism regarding labor unions. Union organizers were frequently seen as attempting to support a Northern agenda of promoting opportunities for African Americans {{at the expense of}} the white population. Because of the situation this created, labor reform was slow to develop. Despite the anti-union sentiments, groups like the International Oil Workers Union attracted membership and held some influence in the industry and state government.|$|E
5|$|A {{very small}} {{proportion}} (those affected by SMAD4 (MADH4) mutations, see below) have multiple benign polyps {{in the large}} intestine, which may bleed or transform into colorectal cancer. A similarly small proportion experiences pulmonary hypertension, a state in which the pressure in the lung arteries is increased, exerting pressure {{on the right side}} of the heart and causing peripheral edema (swelling of the legs), fainting and attacks of chest pain. It has been observed that the risk of thrombosis (particularly venous thrombosis, in the form of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) may be increased. There is <b>a</b> <b>suspicion</b> that those with HHT may have a mild immunodeficiency and are therefore at a slightly increased risk from infections.|$|E
5|$|In some instances, lumbar {{puncture}} {{may be required}} if there is <b>a</b> <b>suspicion</b> that the symptoms might be caused by other problems (meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage). This is {{the examination of the}} cerebrospinal fluid that envelops the brain and the spinal cord; the sample is obtained with a needle that is passed under local anesthetic into the spine. In pituitary apoplexy the results are typically normal, although abnormalities may be detected if blood from the pituitary has entered the subarachnoid space. If there is remaining doubt about the possibility of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a magnetic resonance angiogram (MRI with a contrast agent) may be required to identify aneurysms of the brain blood vessels, {{the most common cause of}} SAH.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear why {{secondary}} infection with a different strain of dengue virus places people at risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The most widely accepted hypothesis is that of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). The exact mechanism behind ADE is unclear. It {{may be caused by}} poor binding of non-neutralizing antibodies and delivery into the wrong compartment of white blood cells that have ingested the virus for destruction. There is <b>a</b> <b>suspicion</b> that ADE is not the only mechanism underlying severe dengue-related complications, and various lines of research have implied a role for T cells and soluble factors such as cytokines and the complement system.|$|E
5|$|On Saturday, 5 October 1985, a {{week after}} the Brixton riot, police arrested Floyd Jarrett, a 24-year-old black man from Tottenham, on {{suspicion}} of being in a stolen car. It was <b>a</b> <b>suspicion</b> {{that turned out to be}} groundless, but a decision was made several hours later to search the home of his mother, Cynthia Jarrett, for stolen goods. In the course of the search she collapsed and died of heart failure. Rose writes that the pathologist, Walter Somerville, told the inquest that Mrs Jarrett had a heart condition that meant she probably only had months to live.|$|E
5|$|As {{she grew}} older Betsy {{suffered}} from numerous illnesses, the exact natures {{of which are}} not recorded but which {{are known to have}} caused William great concern. William began to become paranoid that Betsy would marry and leave his service, in 1835 going as far as to have her sign an affidavit that she would never leave him. In 1843 his older brother Charles, a successful planter in Java, returned to England after over 30 years abroad. William became deeply suspicious that Betsy was becoming too close to Charles, <b>a</b> <b>suspicion</b> intensified when Charles took her on a visit to Holland and the Rhine; Charles returned to Java in 1845. In around 1844 Betsy struck up a close relationship with the pen manufacturer and art collector Joseph Gillott, one of William's regular customers who owned some of his pictures. Gillott was married with children, and the closeness of their relationship caused William concern. In 1848, William retired to York leaving Betsy alone in his London apartment; although aware that Betsy was considering marriage he was confident that he could persuade her to come to York and live with him in his retirement. Betsy did eventually join him in York, and was present at his death.|$|E

5|$|During the revolt, {{the ships}} were noted by many {{observers}} {{to be well}} handled, despite a previous belief that the Brazilian Navy was incapable of effectively operating the ships even before being split by a rebellion. João Cândido Felisberto ordered all liquor thrown overboard, and discipline on the ships was recognized as exemplary. The 4.7-inch guns were often used for shots over the city, but the 12-inch guns were not, which led to <b>a</b> <b>suspicion</b> among the naval officers that the rebels were incapable of using the weapons. Later research and interviews indicate that Minas Geraes guns were fully operational, and while São Paulos could not be turned after salt water contaminated the hydraulic system, British engineers still on board the ship after the voyage from the United Kingdom {{were working on the}} problem. Still, historians have never ascertained how well the mutineers could handle the ships.|$|E
5|$|From the Japanese perspective, {{the battle}} was not going too well either. The Japanese had {{expected}} a landing on Seeadler Harbour, this being the logical American objective, and had concentrated their forces around the Lorengau airfield. The defence of the Momote airstrip and Hyane harbour was the responsibility of Baba Force, built around Captain Baba's 1stBattalion, 229th Infantry Regiment. Colonel Ezaki ordered Baba to attack the beachhead but <b>a</b> <b>suspicion</b> the Hyane Harbour landing was a diversion, coupled with false reports of enemy activity at Salami had him retain the 2nd (Iwakami) Battalion of the 1st Independent Infantry Regiment there instead of sending it to assist Baba Force. By 2March, Ezaki had resolved to attack the Hyane beachhead with his whole force. The difficulties imposed by the terrain, and disruption by American artillery and Allied naval gunfire, forced a postponement of the attack to the night of 3March.|$|E

25|$|According to Moscow, {{relations}} with Georgia deteriorated over alleged {{violations of the}} peace treaty, the re-arrest by Georgia of Georgian Bolsheviks, obstruction of the passage of convoys to Armenia, and <b>a</b> <b>suspicion</b> that Georgia was aiding armed rebels in the North Caucasus.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the start}} of Scouting there was {{criticism}} about a possible military goal of Scouting. It culminated in a schism where Sir Francis Vane and Battersea Scout District formed the British Boy Scouts in 1909, partly due to <b>a</b> <b>suspicion</b> of a too close involvement with military organizations. Baden-Powell always strongly denied this.|$|E
25|$|Most {{commentators}} {{agreed that}} the Liberal Party had little chance of winning government, and that Kerin would step down from the leadership after the election, <b>a</b> <b>suspicion</b> confirmed in Kerin's concession speech. Martin Hamilton-Smith was considering mounting a leadership challenge, however, he withdrew on 14 October 2005 (probably {{for the sake of}} the impression of party unity) and subsequently resigned or was pushed from the opposition frontbench.|$|E

25|$|X-ray: Although {{traditional}} plain X-rays {{are limited}} {{in their ability to}} image soft tissues such as discs, muscles, and nerves, they are still used to confirm or exclude other possibilities such as tumors, infections, fractures, etc. In spite of these limitations, X-ray can still play a relatively inexpensive role in confirming the suspicion of the presence of a herniated disc. If <b>a</b> <b>suspicion</b> is thus strengthened, other methods may be used to provide final confirmation.|$|E
25|$|In fact, {{his only}} reserve {{remaining}} was the 9th Brigade (General Borcke's), {{the withdrawal of}} which would greatly expose his centre; and Napoleon, who had already entertained <b>a</b> <b>suspicion</b> that such was the case, resolved upon terminating the sanguinary combat in the valley, by boldly advancing {{a portion of his}} own intact reserves, consisting of the Guard and VI Corps (Lobau's) — that had just arrived and was posted on the right of Fleurus — against the Prussian centre.|$|E
25|$|The Gardaí were criticised by the {{commission}} of investigation into the Dean Lyons case for their handling of {{the investigation into the}} Grangegorman killings. In his report, George Birmingham said that the Gardaí had used leading questions in their interviews with Lyons, and had failed to act on <b>a</b> <b>suspicion</b> that Lyons' confession was unreliable. For a period, the gardaí involved in the case failed to act on the knowledge that another man, Mark Nash, had confessed to the crime.|$|E
