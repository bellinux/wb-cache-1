3000|$|Based on the second-order CFA, {{the figure}} above reveals how LAK {{explains}} its constructs (<b>assessing</b> reading, <b>assessing</b> listening, <b>assessing</b> writing, <b>assessing</b> speaking) {{in terms of}} their variance. Firstly, standardized path coefficients were reported as [...]. 98 for <b>assessing</b> listening, [...]. 99 for <b>assessing</b> reading, [...]. 89 for <b>assessing</b> writing, and [...]. 98 for <b>assessing</b> speaking. That means, one standard deviation change in LAK (1.000) would lead to 0.994 standard deviation change in <b>assessing</b> reading, [...]. 986 standard deviation change in <b>assessing</b> listening, [...]. 891 standard deviation change in <b>assessing</b> writing, and [...]. 981 standard deviation change in <b>assessing</b> speaking, all of which are good indicators of variance explanation. In addition to this, the error variance values were found as [...]. 027 for <b>assessing</b> listening, [...]. 013 for <b>assessing</b> reading, [...]. 206 for <b>assessing</b> writing, and [...]. 038 for <b>assessing</b> speaking. In other words, these values mean that LAK explains 97 % variance of <b>assessing</b> listening, 98 % variance of <b>assessing</b> reading, 80 % variance of <b>assessing</b> writing, and almost 96 % variance of <b>assessing</b> speaking. In short, as all these values suggest, the model presents a perfect model-data fit in terms of explaining LAK and its constructs.|$|R

40|$|Creativity {{is crucial}} for {{designing}} products and enabling innovation. <b>Assessing</b> creativity can help identify innovative designers and products, and support improvement of both.

This research proposes a new method for <b>assessing</b> the creativity of products as a function of their novelty and usefulness. We develop individual methods for <b>assessing</b> novelty and usefulness of products. and then combine these into a method for <b>assessing</b> creativity of products. The proposed methods have been evaluated by benchmarking them, and other methods available from literature, against the collective, intuitive assessment of product creativity of experienced designers.
