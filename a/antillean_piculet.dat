5|$|The family Picidae was {{introduced}} by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in {{a guide to the}} contents of the British Museum published in 1820. The phylogeny has been updated according to new knowledge about convergence patterns and evolutionary history. Most notably, the relationship of the picine genera has been largely clarified, and it was determined that the <b>Antillean</b> <b>piculet</b> is a surviving offshoot of proto-woodpeckers. Genetic analysis supports the monophyly of Picidae, which seems to have originated in the Old World, but the geographic origins of the Picinae is unclear. The Picumninae is returned as paraphyletic.|$|E
5|$|Woodpeckers have {{a mostly}} {{cosmopolitan}} distribution, {{although they are}} absent from Australasia, Madagascar, and Antarctica. They are also absent {{from some of the}} world's oceanic islands, although many insular species are found on continental islands. The true woodpeckers, subfamily Picinae, are distributed across the entire range of the family. The Picumninae piculets have a pantropical distribution, with species in Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Neotropics, with the greatest diversity being in South America. The second piculet subfamily, Nesoctitinae, has a single member, the <b>Antillean</b> <b>piculet,</b> which is restricted to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. The wrynecks (Jynginae) are found exclusively in the Old World, with the two species occurring in Europe, Asia, and Africa.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Antillean</b> <b>piculet</b> (Nesoctites micromegas) {{has proven}} to be a very {{distinct}} species evolutionarily between piculets and woodpeckers (Benz et al., 2006) and thus is nowadays placed in a subfamily of its own.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Antillean</b> <b>piculet</b> {{feeds on}} insects, with ants and beetles forming {{a large part}} of the diet. They also consume a lot of fruit {{compared}} to other piculets. Individuals and pairs forage rapidly through the understory of their habitat, mostly on small branches, twigs, vines and stalks, and less commonly on trunks. Food is mostly obtained by gleaning, with a few weak pecks (but no hammering as found in the true woodpeckers). The breeding season of the <b>Antillean</b> <b>piculet</b> is March to July. A cavity is excavated in a stump, tree, palm or fence post in which two to four eggs are laid. The pair are highly territorial and will aggressively call and display towards intruders.|$|E
50|$|The family Picidae {{has four}} subfamilies, the Picinae (woodpeckers), the Picumninae (piculets), the Jynginae (wrynecks) and the {{monotypic}} Nesoctitinae (<b>Antillean</b> <b>piculet).</b> Based on morphology and behaviour, the Picumninae {{was considered to}} be the sister clade of the Picinae. This has now been confirmed by phylogenetic analysis and the Jynginae are placed basal to the Picinae, Nesoctitinae and Picumninae.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Antillean</b> <b>piculet</b> {{occupies}} {{a number of}} different habitats within Hispaniola, including humid and dry Pinus and broadleaf forests, as well as semi-arid scrubland and thorn-forest. It will also occupy stands of mangrove forest and occasionally orchards and plantations. It occurs from sea-level to 1800 m, although in pine forests it is more common below 300 m. Within this habitat it prefers dense undergrowth.|$|E
50|$|Unlike most {{woodpecker}}s, the Hispaniolan woodpecker is {{a social}} species that takes advantage of having {{a large number of}} individual adult birds in the colony to protect a nesting bank or tree. There may be twenty pairs of birds in a colony, with several nesting in the same tree. The nests are excavated in trunks and branches, and discarded holes are reused by parrots, parakeets, trogons, the <b>Antillean</b> <b>piculet</b> and the golden swallow.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Antillean</b> <b>piculet</b> (Nesoctites micromegas) is {{a species}} of bird in the {{woodpecker}} family Picidae. It is monotypic within the genus Nesoctites. The species is evolutionarily distinct from the other piculets and is afforded its own subfamily Nesoctitinae. It is endemic to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. A fossil feather in amber attributed to the genus {{has been found in}} the Dominican Republic, showing that the ancestors of the species have been isolated on Hispaniola for at least 25 mya.|$|E
