Wilson, in the Wall Street Journal, {{called the}} book [...] "a masterly effort {{to explain what}} Mr. Pinker regards {{as one of the}} biggest changes in human history: We kill one another less frequently than before. But to give this project its greatest possible effect, he has one more book to write: a briefer account that ties together an argument now presented in 800 pages and that avoids the few topics about which Mr. Pinker has not done careful research." [...] Specifically, the assertions to which Wilson objected were Pinker's writing that (in Wilson's summation), [...] "George W. Bush 'infamously' supported torture; John Kerry was right to think of terrorism as a 'nuisance"; 'Palestinian activist groups' have disavowed violence and now work at building a 'competent government.' Iran will never use its nuclear weapons... <b>and</b> <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bush...</b> is 'unintellectual.' [...] " ...|$|E

A legal counsellor in 1788 gave his opinion that if the writs had been correctly issued, there seemed no possibility of them being released from prison, unless their marriages could be made out to be Quaker, or their Roeite marriages could be made legal by a new Act of Parliament.
