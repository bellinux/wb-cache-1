5|$|Ohio statewide {{offices are}} {{regularly}} contested {{every four years}} in the midterm election years. 2008 is Class 2 senatorial election year, and Ohio is <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>with</b> class 1 and class 3 senators. Thus, the Attorney General race was the only non-presidential race in the 2008 election aside from contests for two seats on the Ohio Supreme Court. Cordray defeated Republican Mike Crites, 57%-38%.|$|E

Stroud's crime was handled in the federal system, as Alaska at that time was still a federal territory, and not <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>with</b> its own judiciary system.|$|E

40|$|In a one-boson-exchange model, {{we study}} {{molecular}} states of double-charm baryon (Ξ_cc(3621)) and a charmed meson (D and D^*).

In addition, we also extend our formula to explore Ξ_ccB̅^(*), Ξ_ccD̅^(*), and Ξ_ccB^(*) systems, and find more possible heavy flavor molecular pentaquarks, <b>a</b> Ξ_ccB̅ <b>state</b> <b>with</b> I(J^P) = 0 (1 / 2 ^-), <b>a</b> Ξ_ccB̅^* <b>state</b> <b>with</b> I(J^P) = 0 (3 / 2 ^-), and Ξ_ccD̅^*/Ξ_ccB^* <b>states</b> <b>with</b> I(J^P) = 0 (1 / 2 ^-).

25|$|The {{censorship}} of books was actually very ineffective, and prohibited books circulated in Spain without significant problems. The Spanish Inquisition never persecuted scientists, and relatively few scientific books {{were placed on}} the Index.

The backwardness of Spain in economy and science may not be attributable to the Inquisition.|$|E

However, unofficially some Transnistrian organisations such as Agroprombank and Gazprombank used the code PRB, a code {{that would otherwise be}} reserved for Puerto Rico (ISO 3166-1 country code PR).

Even in Bavaria (<b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>with</b> a policy of strengthening the Gymnasium) only 56 percent of freshmen had graduated from a Gymnasium.
