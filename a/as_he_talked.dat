25|$|Cruise control {{automatically}} {{controls the}} rate of motion of a motor vehicle. The driver sets the speed and the system will take over the throttle {{of the car to}} maintain the same speed. Cruise control was invented in 1945 by a blind inventor and mechanical engineer named Ralph Teetor. His idea was born out of the frustration of riding in a car driven by his lawyer, who kept speeding up and slowing down <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked.</b> The first car with Teetor's system was the Chrysler Imperial in 1958. This system calculated ground speed based on driveshaft rotations and used a solenoid to vary throttle position as needed.|$|E
25|$|The counterattack failed, as two battalions in {{the centre}} found the German {{shelling}} {{too heavy for}} them to attack, and Monro eventually ordered a halt. Wilson wanted to court martial the two acting battalion commanders for “funk”, after hearing the view {{of one of the}} actual COs (who had been acting in command of the brigade) that the attack had been feasible. Major Armytage, a staff officer from GHQ, visited the sector on 25 May and reported back that Brigadier-General Kellett (99th Brigade, but acting GOC of 2nd Division) was incompetent and “in complete ignorance of the situation”. Haig wrote to Monro (27 May) that Wilson should be asked to explain and that IV Corps, formerly “the most efficient in the army” “had much decreased in military value” and Wilson “had failed as a commander in the field”. Charteris also visited IV Corps HQ on 27 May, and reported back that officers there were “downhearted” and thought the Germans and French better fighters than the British – Wilson later claimed that the officers had been “pulling Charteris’ leg” <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> of “sweeping victories” within two months. Wilson was almost “degummed” (sacked) but was saved by a strong report in his favour by Monro. The two acting battalion commanders were not court-martialled, but Kellett was never promoted to command a division. Jeffery argues that Wilson was, like many “unsuccessful” corps commanders, largely {{in the wrong place at}} the wrong time, and that Haig’s animosity for Wilson was a factor.|$|E

He was adamant the decision to kill was not made until moments before the actual act of murder. Most victims had been killed by strangulation, although on several occasions, he had drowned the victims once they had been strangled into unconsciousness. Once the victim had been killed, he would typically bathe the victim's body, shave any hair from the torso to conform the body to his physical ideal, then apply makeup to any obvious blemishes upon the skin. The body would usually be dressed in socks and underpants, before Nilsen would drape the victims' arms around him <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> to the corpse. With most victims, Nilsen would masturbate as he stood alongside or knelt above the body, and although Nilsen confessed to having occasionally engaged in intercrural sex with his victims' bodies, he repeatedly stressed to investigators he had never penetrated his victims — harking that his victims were [...] "too perfect and beautiful for the pathetic ritual of commonplace sex".|$|E

Wittgenstein's sister Hermine said he became obsessed with mathematics as a result, and was anyway losing interest in aeronautics. He decided instead that he needed to study logic and the foundations of mathematics, describing himself as in a [...] "constant, indescribable, almost pathological state of agitation." [...] In the summer of 1911 he visited Frege at the University of Jena to show him some philosophy of mathematics and logic he had written, and to ask whether it was worth pursuing. He wrote: [...] "I was shown into Frege's study. Frege was a small, neat man with a pointed beard who bounced around the room <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked.</b> He absolutely wiped the floor with me, and I felt very depressed; but at the end he said 'You must come again', so I cheered up. I had several discussions with him after that. Frege would never talk about anything but logic and mathematics, if I started on some other subject, he would say something polite and then plunge back into logic and mathematics." ...|$|E
