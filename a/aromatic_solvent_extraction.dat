The metal extraction is occurring from a deep eutectic solvent which is formed from chemicals suitable for use in food and related products.

30|$|Potential and {{practical}} contributions of tested raw materials aqueous extracts as bio-effector candidates were discussed. The agro-food processing residues and their extracts studied above showed an interesting content, either at nutritional or biochemical level, {{and could be}} used as plant growth promoter. They are differently rich in nutrients, amino-acids, sugars, and low molecular weight molecules as demonstrated by the chemical analysis and NMR metabolic profiling. Furthermore, aqueous extraction resulted higher yield with respect to other used solvent. Water, safe and less expensive than other organic solvents, is effective for BSG, FPR, and LPR extractions under different extraction ratios. In addition, aqueous extracts were not phytotoxic but enhanced seed germination at higher <b>solvent</b> <b>extraction</b> ratio. BSG aqueous extract enhanced seed germination and root growth. FPR aqueous extract, at low <b>solvent</b> <b>extraction</b> ratio, showed low GI which increased when the <b>solvent</b> <b>extraction</b> ratio increased.

40|$|A {{validated}} ion chromatographic {{method was}} developed and applied for {{the determination of the}} maximum solubility of pyridinium ionic liquids in several <b>aromatic</b> <b>solvents.</b> Elution was performed on a Metrosep C 3 – 150 prototype column at 408 C with acetonitrile–water at a flow rate of 1. 0 mL min 21. Mixtures of pyridinium ionic liquids and <b>aromatic</b> <b>solvents</b> were diluted with acetonitrile and acetone on a 1 : 1 : 2 weight base before the analysis. The chromatographic time only took 20 min. The standard curves for both pyridinium ionic liquids ([4 -mebupy]BF 4 and [3 -mebupy]N(CN) 2) were linear (r 2 5 0. 9980 – 0. 9998) in all <b>aromatic</b> <b>solvents</b> (toluene, benzene, ethylben-zene and o-xylene) in the concentration range of 5. 37 – 241 mg kg 21.

The limit of detection for both pyridinium ionic liquids in all solvents varied between 0. 73 and 2. 6 mg kg 21.
