5|$|Estimates of the {{combined}} size of the French Army of the Levant divisions that participated in the battle ranged from 9,000 to 12,000 troops. The troops were mostly made up of Senegalese and <b>Algerian</b> units, and consisted of ten infantry battalions {{and a number of}} cavalry and artillery units. Among the participating units were the 415th Infantry Regiment, the 2nd <b>Algerian</b> Riflemen Regiment, the Senegalese Division, the African Riflemen Regiment and the Moroccan Sipahi Battalion. A number of Maronite volunteers from Mount Lebanon reportedly joined the French forces as well. The Army of the Levant was equipped with plain and mountain artillery batteries and 155mm guns, and backed by tanks and fighter bombers. The commander of the French forces was General Mariano Goybet.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{relatively}} intense language contact, Central Atlas Tamazight has a large stratum of Arabic loans. Many borrowed words in Berber also have native synonyms, e.g. /lbab/ or /tiflut/ 'door', the latter used more in rural areas. The contact was unequal, as Moroccan Arabic has not borrowed as much from Berber languages, though Berber has contributed to Moroccan and <b>Algerian</b> Arabics' very reduced vowel systems.|$|E

5|$|During the War of 1812, the Barbary states took {{advantage}} of the weakness of the United States Navy to again capture American merchant ships and sailors. After the Treaty of Ghent was signed, the United States looked at ending the piracy in the Mediterranean which had plagued American merchants for two decades. On 3 March 1815, the U.S. Congress authorized deployment of naval power against Algiers, beginning the Second Barbary War. Two powerful squadrons under the command of Commodores Stephen Decatur, Jr. and William Bainbridge, including the 74-gun ships of the line , , and , were dispatched to the Mediterranean. Shortly after departing Gibraltar en route to Algiers, Decatur's squadron encountered the <b>Algerian</b> flagship Meshuda, and, in the Action of 17 June 1815, captured it. Not long afterward, the American squadron likewise captured the <b>Algerian</b> brig Estedio in the Battle off Cape Palos. By June, the squadrons had reached Algiers and peace was negotiated with the Dey, including a return of captured vessels and men, a guarantee of no further tributes and a right to trade in the region.|$|E

5|$|He was {{thereafter}} mostly {{withdrawn from}} public life, dedicating himself to researching {{the work of}} 15th-century poet François Villon, and, like his fellow Surrealist Michel Leiris, to promoting primitive and African art, {{which he had been}} collecting for years. In early 1957, Tzara attended a Dada retrospective on the Rive Gauche, which ended in a riot caused by the rival avant-garde Mouvement Jariviste, an outcome which reportedly pleased him. In August 1960, one year after the Fifth Republic had been established by President Charles de Gaulle, French forces were confronting the <b>Algerian</b> rebels (see <b>Algerian</b> War). Together with Simone de Beauvoir, Marguerite Duras, Jérôme Lindon, Alain Robbe-Grillet and other intellectuals, he addressed Premier Michel Debré a letter of protest, concerning France's refusal to grant Algeria its independence. As a result, Minister of Culture André Malraux announced that his cabinet would not subsidize any films to which Tzara and the others might contribute, and the signatories could no longer appear on stations managed by the state-owned French Broadcasting Service.|$|E

The historian Jean-Paul Brunet found satisfactory evidence for the murder of 31 <b>Algerians,</b> while suggesting that a number of up to 50 actual victims was credible.|$|R
5|$|In July 1962, Algeria became {{independent}} of France.

5|$|The Moroccan Division was {{initially}} raised as the Marching Division of Morocco.

The division contained Tirailleurs and Zouaves, of principally Tunisian and <b>Algerian</b> origin, and most notably Legionnaires from the 2nd Marching Regiment of the 1st Foreign Regiment and the 7th <b>Algerian</b> Tirailleurs Regiment.

They sent another delegation to France in 1912 to present the [...] "Young <b>Algerians</b> Manifesto", which demanded reforms including equal taxation, representation in the French National Assembly, wider suffrage and the abolition of the Code de l'Indigénat. They were also able to publish a number of journals including L'Islam and El-Hack.|$|R
