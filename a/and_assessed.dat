5|$|An MR venogram is also {{performed}} {{in most cases}} to exclude the possibility of venous sinus stenosis/obstruction or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. A contrast-enhanced MRV (ATECO) scan has a high detection rate for abnormal transverse sinus stenoses.

Buckling of the bilateral optic nerves with increased perineural fluid is also often noted on MRI imaging.|$|E

5|$|After {{losing the}} first game of their Adams Division semi-final to the Quebec Nordiques in {{overtime}}, the Canadiens won ten overtime games en route to the title, setting an NHL record for most consecutive overtime victories in a playoff year. As with the 1986 championship, the team was led by Roy, who won his second Conn Smythe Trophy. The defining moment of the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals occurred in the second game, with less than two minutes to play and Montreal trailing the series 1–0 and the game 2–1. Attempting to gain an advantage for his team, head coach Jacques Demers called for a measurement of Los Angeles Kings forward Marty McSorley's stick. Referee Kerry Fraser determined that the blade had an illegal curve, <b>and</b> <b>assessed</b> a penalty against McSorley. Montreal scored on the power play to tie the game, and then won in overtime 3–2, to tie the series. Montreal also won Games 3 and 4 in overtime before eliminating the Kings in Game 5, 4–1. The celebration was marred by one of the worst riots in Montreal history, as fans rioted through downtown Montreal causing over $2.5million in property damage and 168 injuries.|$|E
5|$|At 1800 UTC on September 29, the JTWC {{classified}} {{the depression}} as Tropical Storm Angela. The system initially tracking northwestward, Angela turned westward {{along the southern}} periphery of a subtropical ridge to the north. The tropical storm began to rapidly intensify, and the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm at 1800 UTC on September 30, while the JTWC estimated that it had attained typhoon intensity. The JMA then upgraded Angela to a typhoon shortly thereafter, <b>and</b> <b>assessed</b> it as having reached peak intensity on October 2, with 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 175km/h (110mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 925 millibars. Continuing westward, the typhoon attained super typhoon status four days later, and the JWTC reported that Angela peaked in strength on October 5. Between October 5 and October 6, Angela crossed the northern coast of Luzon in the Philippines.|$|E

5|$|Caldwell {{is perhaps}} best {{known as one of}} the {{principal}} architects of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the first act of its kind in the world, signed into law on January 1, 1970. In drafting A National Policy on the Environment in 1968 as consultant to Senator Henry Jackson, the head of the powerful Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, Caldwell realized that more was needed than a mere a policy statement: an “action-forcing mechanism” would be necessary to secure federal agency compliance with the Act’s requirements. The origin of the requirement for preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) has been attributed to Caldwell, whose testimony at the Senate hearing in April 1969 laid the groundwork for inclusion of provisions requiring an evaluation of the effects of all major federal projects significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. In these “detailed statements,” as they were termed in the Act, all reasonably foreseeable social, economic, and environmental effects of a proposed action and any possible alternatives to it must be identified <b>and</b> <b>assessed</b> before any federal action takes place.|$|E
5|$|English {{taxation}} {{after the}} Norman Conquest of 1066 {{was based on}} the geld or danegeld, a national tax paid by all free men, those who were not serfs or slaves. The geld {{was based on the}} number of hides of land owned by the taxpayer, and could be demanded by the king <b>and</b> <b>assessed</b> at varying levels without the need for consultation with the barons or other subjects. During King Henry I's reign, an increasing number of exemptions, and the difficulties encountered in collecting the geld, lowered its importance to the Exchequer—the treasury of England. It is unclear whether the geld was collected at all during the reign of Henry's successor, King Stephen. Stephen's successor, King Henry II, collected the geld only twice, once in 1155 and again in 1161–1162. The geld was unpopular, and after 1162 Henry may have felt it politically expedient to stop collecting it.|$|E
