5|$|RNA Holliday {{junctions}} assume an <b>antiparallel</b> stacked conformation at high magnesium concentrations, a perpendicular stacked conformation at moderate concentrations, {{and rotate}} into a parallel stacked conformation at low concentrations, while even small calcium ion concentrations favor the <b>antiparallel</b> conformer.|$|E
5|$|Initially, geneticists {{assumed that}} the {{junction}} would adopt a parallel rather than <b>antiparallel</b> conformation, because that would place the homologous duplexes in closer alignment to each other. Chemical analysis in the 1980s showed that the junction actually preferred the <b>antiparallel</b> conformation, a finding that was considered controversial, and Robin Holliday himself initially doubted the findings. The <b>antiparallel</b> structure later became widely accepted due to X-ray crystallography data on in vitro molecules, although as of 2004 the implications for the in vivo structure remained unclear, especially {{the structure of the}} junctions is often altered by proteins bound to it.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} such motif is the double {{crossover}} (DX) complex, which contains two Holliday junctions {{in close proximity}} to each other, resulting in a rigid structure that can self-assemble into larger arrays. The structure of the DX molecule forces the Holliday junctions to adopt a conformation with the double-helical domains directly side-by-side, in contrast to their preferred angle of about 60°. The complex can be designed to force the junctions into either a parallel or <b>antiparallel</b> orientation, but in practice the <b>antiparallel</b> variety are more well-behaved, and the parallel version is rarely used.|$|E
5|$|The {{order of}} a liquid crystal could also be {{characterized}} by using other even Legendre polynomials (all the odd polynomials average to zero since the director can point in either of two <b>antiparallel</b> directions). These higher-order averages {{are more difficult to}} measure, but can yield additional information about molecular ordering.|$|E
5|$|The unstacked form is {{a nearly}} square planar, {{extended}} conformation. On the other hand, the stacked conformers have two continuous double-helical domains separated by an angle of about 60° in a right-handed direction. Two {{of the four}} strands stay roughly helical, remaining {{within each of the}} two double-helical domains, while the other two cross between the two domains in an <b>antiparallel</b> fashion.|$|E
5|$|Inhibitory serpins do not inhibit {{their target}} proteases by the typical {{competitive}} (lock-and-key) mechanism used by most small protease inhibitors (e.g. Kunitz-type inhibitors). Instead, serpins use an unusual conformational change, which disrupts {{the structure of}} the protease and prevents it from completing catalysis. The conformational change involves the RCL moving to {{the opposite end of the}} protein and inserting into β-sheet A, forming an extra <b>antiparallel</b> β-strand. This converts the serpin from a stressed state, to a lower-energy relaxed state (S to R transition).|$|E
5|$|Like the {{components}} of other intermediate filaments, the lamin monomer contains an alpha-helical domain used by two monomers to coil around each other, forming a dimer structure called a coiled coil. Two of these dimer structures then join side by side, in an <b>antiparallel</b> arrangement, to form a tetramer called a protofilament. Eight of these protofilaments form a lateral arrangement that is twisted to form a ropelike filament. These filaments can be assembled or disassembled in a dynamic manner, meaning that changes in {{the length of the}} filament depend on the competing rates of filament addition and removal.|$|E
5|$|The Tower domain {{adopts a}} {{secondary}} structure {{consisting of a}} pair of long, <b>antiparallel</b> alpha-helices (the stem) that support a three-helix bundle (3HB) at their end. The 3HB contains a helix-turn-helix motif and is similar to the DNA binding domains of the bacterial site-specific recombinases, and of eukaryotic Myb and homeodomain transcription factors. The Tower domain has {{an important role in the}} tumour suppressor function of BRCA2, and is essential for appropriate binding of BRCA2 to DNA.|$|E
5|$|The two {{strands of}} DNA run in {{opposite}} directions {{to each other and}} are thus <b>antiparallel.</b> Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases (informally, bases). It is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes biological information. RNA strands are created using DNA strands as a template in a process called transcription. Under the genetic code, these RNA strands are translated to specify the sequence of amino acids within proteins in a process called translation.|$|E
5|$|A {{common and}} popular {{structural}} alignment method is the DALI, or distance alignment matrix method, which breaks the input structures into hexapeptide fragments and calculates a distance matrix by evaluating the contact patterns between successive fragments. Secondary structure features that involve residues that are contiguous in sequence {{appear on the}} matrix's main diagonal; other diagonals in the matrix reflect spatial contacts between residues that are not near {{each other in the}} sequence. When these diagonals are parallel to the main diagonal, the features they represent are parallel; when they are perpendicular, their features are <b>antiparallel.</b> This representation is memory-intensive because the features in the square matrix are symmetrical (and thus redundant) about the main diagonal.|$|E
5|$|Cell {{division}} {{is essential for}} an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for DNA replication. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's complementary DNA sequence is recreated by an enzyme called DNA polymerase. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5′ to 3′ direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the <b>antiparallel</b> strands of the double helix. In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.|$|E
5|$|The {{backbone}} of the DNA strand is made from alternating phosphate and sugar residues. The sugar in DNA is 2-deoxyribose, which is a pentose (five-carbon) sugar. The sugars are joined together by phosphate groups that form phosphodiester bonds between the third and fifth carbon atoms of adjacent sugar rings. These asymmetric bonds mean a strand of DNA has a direction. In a double helix, {{the direction of the}} nucleotides in one strand is opposite to their direction in the other strand: the strands are <b>antiparallel.</b> The asymmetric ends of DNA strands are said to have a directionality of five prime (5′) and three prime (3′), with the 5′ end having a terminal phosphate group and the 3′ end a terminal hydroxyl group. One major difference between DNA and RNA is the sugar, with the 2-deoxyribose in DNA being replaced by the alternative pentose sugar ribose in RNA.|$|E
25|$|The common {{house mouse}} TNFα and human TNF are {{structurally}} different. The 17-kilodalton (kDa) TNF protomers (185-amino acid-long) {{are composed of}} two <b>antiparallel</b> -pleated sheets with <b>antiparallel</b> -strands, forming a 'jelly roll' β-structure, typical for the TNF family, but also found in viral capsid proteins.|$|E
25|$|The Greek key motif {{consists}} of four adjacent <b>antiparallel</b> strands and their linking loops. It {{consists of}} three <b>antiparallel</b> strands connected by hairpins, while the fourth is adjacent to the first and linked to the third by a longer loop. This type of structure forms easily during the protein folding process. It was named after a pattern common to Greek ornamental artwork (see meander).|$|E
25|$|The {{reverse of}} the {{electromagnetic}} wave, characterized by an <b>antiparallel</b> phase velocity is also an indicator of negative index of refraction.|$|E
25|$|Immunoglobulin {{superfamily}} - Members share a sandwich-like {{structure of}} two sheets of <b>antiparallel</b> β strands (Ig-fold), and {{are involved in}} recognition, binding, and adhesion.|$|E
25|$|The {{probability}} {{of the same}} result being obtained at the two locations depends on the relative angles at which the two spin measurements are made, and is strictly between zero and one for all relative angles other than perfectly parallel or <b>antiparallel</b> alignments (0° or 180°). Since total angular momentum is conserved, and since the total spin is zero in the singlet state, the {{probability of}} the same result with parallel (<b>antiparallel)</b> alignment is 0 (1). This last prediction is true classically as well as quantum mechanically.|$|E
25|$|A cap-membrane-binding domain {{is found}} in prokaryotic lactate dehydrogenase. This {{consists}} of a large seven-stranded <b>antiparallel</b> beta-sheet flanked on both sides by alpha-helices. It allows for membrane association.|$|E
25|$|The DENV prM (membrane) protein, {{which is}} {{important}} in the formation and maturation of the viral particle, consists of seven <b>antiparallel</b> β-strands stabilized by three disulfide bonds.|$|E
25|$|Two vectors are {{parallel}} {{if they have}} the same direction but not necessarily the same magnitude, or <b>antiparallel</b> if they have opposite direction but not necessarily the same magnitude.|$|E
25|$|A simple supersecondary protein {{topology}} {{composed of}} 2 or more consecutive <b>antiparallel</b> β-strands linked together by hairpin loops. This motif {{is common in}} β-sheets {{and can be found}} in several structural architectures including β-barrels and β-propellers.|$|E
25|$|To {{create a}} {{population}} inversion under these conditions, {{it is necessary}} to selectively remove some atoms or molecules from the system based on differences in properties. For instance, in a hydrogen maser, the well-known 21cm wave transition in atomic hydrogen, where the lone electron flips its spin state from parallel to the nuclear spin to <b>antiparallel,</b> can be used to create a population inversion because the parallel state has a magnetic moment and the <b>antiparallel</b> state does not. A strong inhomogeneous magnetic field will separate out atoms in the higher energy state from a beam of mixed state atoms. The separated population represents a population inversion which can exhibit stimulated emissions.|$|E
25|$|In an <b>antiparallel</b> arrangement, the {{successive}} β-strands alternate directions {{so that the}} N-terminus of one strand is adjacent to the C-terminus of the next. This is the arrangement that produces the strongest inter-strand stability because it allows the inter-strand hydrogen bonds between carbonyls and amines to be planar, which is their preferred orientation. The peptide backbone dihedral angles (φ,ψ) are about (–140°,135°) in <b>antiparallel</b> sheets. In this case, if two atoms C and C are adjacent in two hydrogen-bonded β-strands, then they form two mutual backbone hydrogen bonds to each other's flanking peptide groups; {{this is known as}} a close pair of hydrogen bonds.|$|E
25|$|Some simple {{combinations}} of secondary structure elements {{have been found}} to frequently occur in protein structure and are referred to as supersecondary structure or motifs. For example, the β-hairpin motif consists of two adjacent <b>antiparallel</b> β-strands joined by a small loop. It is present in most <b>antiparallel</b> β structures both as an isolated ribbon and as part of more complex β-sheets. Another common super-secondary structure is the β-α-β motif, which is frequently used to connect two parallel β-strands. The central α-helix connects the C-termini of the first strand to the N-termini of the second strand, packing its side chains against the β-sheet and therefore shielding the hydrophobic residues of the β-strands from the surface.|$|E
25|$|All-β domains have a core {{composed}} of <b>antiparallel</b> β-sheets, usually two sheets packed against each other. Various patterns {{can be identified}} in {{the arrangement of the}} strands, often giving rise to the identification of recurring motifs, for example the Greek key motif.|$|E
25|$|Because peptide chains have a {{directionality}} conferred {{by their}} N-terminus and C-terminus, β-strands too {{can be said}} to be directional. They are usually represented in protein topology diagrams by an arrow pointing toward the C-terminus. Adjacent β-strands can form hydrogen bonds in <b>antiparallel,</b> parallel, or mixed arrangements.|$|E
25|$|Each {{chain is}} {{composed}} of two extracellular domains: Variable (V) region and a Constant (C) region, both of Immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) domain forming <b>antiparallel</b> β-sheets. The Constant region is proximal to the cell membrane, followed by a transmembrane region and a short cytoplasmic tail, while the Variable region binds to the peptide/MHC complex.|$|E
25|$|It has an all-beta structure, {{whereby the}} {{two pairs of}} <b>antiparallel</b> beta sheets are {{connected}} by a diagonally running extended beta-sheet. The sheets then further fold to form a beta prism in which each wall is composed of {{a complete set of}} five beta-strands. The GIN domain is often followed by a neck domain.|$|E
25|$|The psi-loop (Ψ-loop) motif {{consists}} of two <b>antiparallel</b> strands with one strand in between that is connected to both by hydrogen bonds. There are four possible strand topologies for single Ψ-loops. This motif is rare as the process resulting in its formation seems unlikely to occur during protein folding. The Ψ-loop was first identified in the aspartic protease family.|$|E
25|$|Experimental {{results show}} that (nearly) all {{produced}} and observed neutrinos have left-handed helicities (spins <b>antiparallel</b> to momenta), and all antineutrinos have right-handed helicities, within the margin of error. In the massless limit, it means that only one of two possible chiralities is observed for either particle. These are the only chiralities included in the Standard Model of particle interactions.|$|E
25|$|The {{catalytic}} {{domains of}} all the aaRSs of a given class {{are found to be}} homologous to one another, whereas class I and class II aaRSs are unrelated to one another. The class I aaRSs have the ubiquitous Rossmann fold and have the parallel beta-strands architecture, whereas the class II aaRSs have a unique fold made up of <b>antiparallel</b> beta-strands.|$|E
25|$|Covalent {{catalysis}} {{is performed}} with an Asp-His-Cys triad, {{split between the}} two barrels (Asp on β1 and His and Cys on β2). The substrate is held as a β-sheet, forming an <b>antiparallel</b> interaction with the cleft between the barrels and a parallel interaction with the C-terminal tail. The enzyme therefore forms a binding tunnel around the substrate and side chain interactions control specificity.|$|E
25|$|The term Cellulose I is {{used for}} this {{parallel}} arrangement, whereas crystalline fibrils bearing <b>antiparallel</b> polyglucan chains arise forming the thermodynamically stable Cellulose II. The molecular arrangement in the sheet, confirmed by X-ray diffraction, was such that the molecular chain axis lay randomly perpendicular to the thickness such that the (1 1 0) plane was oriented parallel to the surface.|$|E
25|$|A {{very simple}} {{structural}} motif involving β-sheets is the β-hairpin, {{in which two}} <b>antiparallel</b> strands are linked by a short loop of two to five residues, of which one is frequently a glycine or a proline, both of which can assume the dihedral-angle conformations required for a tight turn or a β-bulge loop. Individual strands can also be linked in more elaborate ways with longer loops that may contain α-helices.|$|E
25|$|The N and C-termini of IF {{proteins}} are non-alpha-helical {{regions and}} show wide variation in their lengths and sequences across IF families. The basic building-block for IFs is a parallel and in-register dimer. The dimer is formed through {{the interaction of}} the rod domain to form a coiled coil. Cytoplasmic IF assemble into non-polar unit-length filaments (ULF). Identical ULF associate laterally into staggered, <b>antiparallel,</b> soluble tetramers, which associate head-to-tail into protofilaments that pair up laterally into protofibrils, four of which wind together into an intermediate filament.|$|E
25|$|The first β-sheet {{structure}} was proposed by William Astbury in the 1930s. He proposed {{the idea of}} hydrogen bonding between the peptide bonds of parallel or <b>antiparallel</b> extended β-strands. However, Astbury {{did not have the}} necessary data on the bond geometry of the amino acids in order to build accurate models, especially since he did not then know that the peptide bond was planar. A refined version was proposed by Linus Pauling and Robert Corey in 1951. Their model incorporated the planarity of the peptide bond which they previously explained as resulting from keto-enol tautomerization.|$|E
