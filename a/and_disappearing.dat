5|$|The {{meteoroid}} grazed Earth's atmosphere quite gently (in comparison to, for example, the 1972Great Daylight Fireball {{above the}} United States and Canada). It became visible north of Uherský Brod, Czechoslovakia, at {{a height of}} 103.7km, approaching the Earth's surface to 98.67km northeast of Wrocław, Poland, <b>and</b> <b>disappearing</b> from sight at a height of 100.4km north of Poznań, Poland. It would probably still have been visible until it reached a height of 110km above the southern Baltic Sea.|$|E
5|$|As the {{hurricane}} turned northward and {{was seen as}} a threat to the Hawaiian Islands, officials in the Papahanaumokuakea requested that all 17personnel in the region be evacuated. Several days before the storm passed through the islands, an AC-130 aircraft was flown to the area and evacuated the people stationed on Tern Island, while a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration vessel evacuated the temporary residents on Laysan Island. Hurricane Neki caused relatively little damage in the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument. All of the structures were undamaged; however, two small natural habitat islands, Round <b>and</b> <b>Disappearing</b> Islands, were affected substantially. The former lost some land area and the latter was completely washed away.|$|E

She was rearmed {{with a pair of}} 12-pounder (3 inch, 76mm) guns and depth charges, weapons more suitable for her new role as an anti-submarine patrol boat. Swordfish joined the 1st Destroyer Flotilla at Portsmouth upon completion of her sea trials, but nothing is known of her subsequent service.|$|E

5|$|The Červená hora {{image was}} {{especially}} valuable. It recorded the fireball's trajectory over approximately 110°, starting 51° above the southern horizon, passing the zenith just 1° westward <b>and</b> <b>disappearing</b> only 19° above the northern horizon (thus crossing about 60% of the sky). Its camera was also {{equipped with a}} rotating shutter that interrupted the exposure 12.5 times per second and divided the captured track of the fireball, allowing the determination of its speed. Over the last 4°, the fireball's angular velocity was lower than {{the resolution of the}} instrument. The Svratouch image recorded the trajectory only for about 15°, beginning at 30° above the northwest horizon, and the pictured fireball was quite weak. Despite this, the data were sufficient for the calculations.|$|E
5|$|The N.W.O.B.H.M. Encyclopedia by Malc Macmillan lists {{more than}} 500 {{recording}} bands {{established in the}} decade between 1975 and 1985 and related to the movement. Probably as many bands launched in the same period, but never emerged from their local club scene, or recorded nothing more than demo tapes or limited pressings of self-produced singles. The disinterest of record labels, poor management of bands, internal struggles and musical choices that turned off much of their original fan base, resulted in most groups disbanding <b>and</b> <b>disappearing</b> {{by the end of}} the decade. A few of the best known groups, such as Praying Mantis in Japan and Saxon, Demon and Tokyo Blade in mainland Europe, survived in foreign markets. Some others, namely Raven, Girlschool and Grim Reaper, tried to break through in the US market signing with American labels, but their attempts were unsuccessful. Two of the more popular bands of the movement, however, went on to considerable, lasting success. Iron Maiden has since become one of the most commercially successful and influential heavy metal bands of all time, even after adopting a more progressive style. Def Leppard became even more successful, targeting the American mainstream rock market with their more refined hard rock sound.|$|E

25|$|Uranus {{exhibits}} a considerable seasonal variation over its 84-year orbit. It is generally brighter near solstices and dimmer at equinoxes.

Still there exist some intrinsic variations of the reflectivity of the atmosphere: periodically fading and brightening polar caps as well as appearing <b>and</b> <b>disappearing</b> polar collars.|$|E

25|$|The {{outer edge}} of the {{floating}} fabric was attached to a 30.5centimeter (12inch) diameter octagonal boom, in sections, of the same color as the fabric. The boom was connected to the radial anchor lines, which extended from the anchors at the island to the 610 specially made anchors, spaced at 15.3meter (50ft) intervals, 76meters (250ft) beyond the perimeter of each island, driven into the limestone {{at the bottom of the}} Bay.

25|$|Other {{scholars}} regard Dʿmt as {{the result}} of a union of Afroasiatic-speaking cultures of the Cushitic and Semitic branches; namely, local Agaw peoples and Sabaeans from South Arabia. However, Ge'ez, the ancient Semitic language of Ethiopia, is thought to have developed independently from Sabaean, one of the South Semitic languages. As early as 2000 BC, other Semitic speakers were living in Ethiopia and Eritrea where Ge'ez developed. Sabaean influence is now thought to have been minor, limited to a few localities, <b>and</b> <b>disappearing</b> after a few decades or a century. It may have been a trading or military colony in alliance with the Ethiopian civilization of Dʿmt or some other proto-Aksumite state.|$|E

25|$|In June 1986 Mehmet and Ali start a cab {{firm called}} 'OzCabs' from a corner table in Ali's Café. Mehmet is married with three children, but monogamy is one {{sanctity}} of marriage {{that he is}} {{more than willing to}} overlook. Later that month punk Mary Smith (Linda Davidson) catches his eye, and so he bets his sceptical brother £10 that he can get Mary to have sex with him. Mary is well aware that Mehmet's intentions are dishonourable and initially refuses to have sex with him, but Mehmet persists and she finally relents and spends the night with him. A triumphant Mehmet then collects his winnings and gloats to his brother in the café. However, Mary overhears their entire conversation and she then sets about trying to get revenge on him by hoax calling his cab-firm and vandalising his car. Later in the year Mehmet acts as Pat Wicks's (Pam St. Clement) pimp, setting her up with clients on a regular basis and he even persuades Pat to convince Mary to go prostitute herself too. He also gets involved in Kathy Beale's (Gillian Taylforth) Knitting business, later conning her <b>and</b> <b>disappearing</b> with all her profits. After he gets into more trouble with his customers for overcharging on fares and then trying to seduce Hannah Carpenter (Sally Sagoe) — the wife of his employee — the residents of Albert Square decide to confront him. Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), Pete Beale (Peter Dean) and Tony Carpenter (Oscar James) find him and give him a severe beating which involves having his arms pinned behind his back whilst taking a number of blows to the stomach.|$|E
