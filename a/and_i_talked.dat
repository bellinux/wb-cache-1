25|$|The polite {{thing would}} be to say 'No comment'. But the truth is that... let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more {{completely}} subservient and prostrate themselves {{at the feet of}} a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> to Stanley a lot about that film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because {{there is no reason to}} do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.|$|E

500|$|Steinbrenner named Lemon the team's {{field manager}} {{a second time}} on September 6, 1981, the sixth Yankees' manager change since 1978. Lemon {{moved on to the}} post-season and {{dispatched}} the Milwaukee Brewers and the Billy Martin-led Oakland Athletics, and won the first two games of the 1981 World Series against the Dodgers, only to lose four straight and the Series. Lemon survived just a few weeks into the 1982 season (the Yankees were 6–8) before Steinbrenner dismissed him one last time, despite a promise for Steinbrenner he would manage the season [...] "no matter what." [...] Of the agreement between Lemon and Steinbrenner, Steinbrenner said, [...] "Lem <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked.</b> He said it was O.K. He said he didn't take it as a promise anyway." [...] Gene Michael succeeded Lemon as manager. He had managed just over one full season of games (172) for the Yankees, winning 99 games for a [...]576 winning percentage.|$|E

500|$|Ripken {{was drafted}} by the Baltimore Orioles {{in the second round}} of the 1978 Major League Baseball draft 48th overall. Despite a story written by SABR, Ripken was {{selected}} with the Orioles' predetermined draft pick, not through a forfeited pick from the Boston Red Sox after the Sox selected Dick Drago in the 1977 re-entry draft. The Orioles would select catcher Cecil Whitehead with the pick they received from Boston two picks after Ripken. On deciding to go straight from high school to the professional level, he said, [...] "When the colleges started coming around, Dad <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> about mostly whether I was going to pursue a career in baseball. If I had the ability, the feeling was to get on with it, and if it didn't work out, start over again in college at 25 or 26." [...] Ripken played both pitcher and shortstop in high school; in fact, the Orioles were the only team not just interested in his pitching ability. The Orioles decided to start him playing shortstop in the minor leagues, deciding it would be easier for him to transition back to pitching if necessary than it would be for him to start hitting again.|$|E
500|$|During summer 2001, Black Isle Studios {{employed}} three development teams. These {{included the}} Icewind Dale team, the team developing Torn, {{and a team}} working on an unannounced project. Before and during Torns development, several members of its team expressed interest in developing another game using the Infinity Engine. The development team was not made aware of Black Isle Studios' decision to develop Icewind Dale II until Torns cancellation. Lead designer J. E. Sawyer described, [...] "I don't know when the producers {{decided to make the}} game, but I was told that we were making the game when I learned that TORN was being cancelled ... on a Wednesday afternoon", and that Feargus Urquhart [...] "asked me to work with Steve Bokkes to create a story and area overview by Thursday afternoon. Steve <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> about {{it for the rest of}} the day. I went home that night and worked on the overviews until the next day. I came in and turned the docs in, and after the Friday division meeting, the project was in development." [...] During this period, Interplay Entertainment relied on Black Isle Studios' games to alleviate financial trouble, which put pressure to release games quickly. The decision to develop Icewind Dale II was based partly on the original Icewind Dales reception, and the development teams' ability to create a game with the Infinity Engine relatively quickly. Sawyer said of the decision, [...] "In all honesty, the reasons for making Icewind Dale II have to do with limiting risks and maximizing our chances for a popular title." [...] Conceptualization of Icewind Dale II progressed during the development of the Icewind Dale expansions, and production began late July 2001, shortly after the completion of [...] After six months of development, Icewind Dale II was officially announced on February 4, 2002.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{his time}} {{working on the}} Trump {{campaign}} {{and the fact that}} he previously worked for politicians in Russia, Caputo was contacted by the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on May 9, 2017, as part of their investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. The House Intelligence Committee requested Caputo come in and be interviewed voluntarily and submit to the Committee relevant documents associated with their investigation. During a March 20, 2017 hearing, Representative Jackie Speier questioned FBI Director James Comey about Caputo, and cited employment with Gazprom and history in Ukraine. Caputo worked with the House Intelligence Committee in order to acquiesce to their queries. Posting to social media, Caputo denied ties to Russia while on the Trump campaign. Caputo told the House Intelligence Committee: [...] "The only time the President <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> about Russia was in 2013, when he simply asked me in passing what it was like to live there in the context of a dinner conversation." [...] Caputo hired attorney Dennis Vacco to represent him during the investigation, and subsequently stated that he had liquidated his children's college funds to pay Vacco.|$|E
2500|$|As an Illinois State Senator, Obama {{supported}} Senate bill 0099 for [...] "age and developmentally appropriate" [...] sex education, {{which would}} have allowed parents to choose to withdraw their children from the classes. The bill was endorsed by the Illinois Parent Teacher Association, the Illinois State Medical Society, the Illinois Public Health Association, and the Illinois Education Association. In a debate in 2004, when questioned by Alan Keyes {{about what kind of}} sex education was [...] "age appropriate" [...] for kindergarteners, Obama said, [...] "I'll give you an example, because I have a six-year-old daughter and a three-year-old daughter, {{and one of the things}} my wife <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> to our daughter about is the possibility of somebody touching them inappropriately, and what that might mean. And that was included specifically in the law, so that kindergarteners are able to exercise some possible protection against abuse...." [...] In 2007, in response to a similar attack from Mitt Romney, an Obama spokesperson stated his position that communities should determine the curriculum. The Illinois bill did not call for addressing all sex-related issues in kindergarten classes, and Obama has said that he [...] "does not support teaching explicit sex education to children in kindergarten." ...|$|E

2500|$|Theisen placed {{second at}} the Canadian Track and Field Championships {{and went on}} to finish {{eleventh}} in the heptathlon at the 2012 London Olympics. A score of 6376 points at the 2013 Hypo Meeting was enough to win the high-profile event ahead of Tatyana Chernova, and she formed a rare Canadian combined events double alongside the men's winner Damian Warner. The 2013 World Championships in Athletics was a wide open event in the heptathlon in that two of the world's best competitors in Chernova and Jessica Ennis-Hill both missed the competition as a result of injuries. Despite putting up a personal best 6,530 points, she had to settle for silver, just 56 points behind eventual World Champion Hanna Melnichenko. After Gotzis, this was the second major competition in a row where the Canadian men and women multi-eventers had a double medal meeting after Warner won bronze at the world championships; however, a double gold for the power couple of Eaton and Eaton-Theisen was narrowly missed. She commented on her achievement saying [...] "I'm at peace getting silver knowing I gave it 110 per cent. Ashton <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> about both being on the podium here.
