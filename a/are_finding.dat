5|$|The {{government}} {{believed that}} the changes were needed because of the collapse in unskilled jobs in the economy, which means that young school leavers at 16 years of age <b>are</b> <b>finding</b> it increasingly more difficult to find employment, consequentially in many cases making them unemployable. Within the last 40 years, the number of unskilled jobs available have more than halved, from 8 million in the 1960s to 3.5 by 2007, with predictions of further drops to just 600,000 by 2020 due to the increasing demand for skilled labour. This, together with fewer students continuing their further education, increase the difficulty for young school leavers to find work if they were either not able, or chose not to, stay on at school and complete further education.|$|E

25|$|Among other factors, declining {{membership}} of organized religions {{and the growth}} of secularism in the western world have given rise to this broader view of spirituality.

25|$|In September 2011, {{plans were}} {{announced}} to demolish some University buildings that were damaged from an earthquake. In the {{months following the}} earthquake, the University lost 25 per cent of its first-year students and 8 per cent of continuing students. The number of international students, who pay much higher fees and are {{a major source of}} revenue, dropped by 30 per cent. By 2013, the University had lost 22 per cent of its students. However, a record number of 886 PhD students are enrolled at the University of Canterbury as of 2013. Other New Zealand universities, apparently defying an informal agreement, launched billboard and print advertising campaigns in the earthquake-ravaged city to recruit University of Canterbury students who <b>are</b> <b>finding</b> it difficult to study there.

According to some researchers, the average rate of post-traumatic stress disorder among children {{from both sides of}} the Green Line is about 70 per cent. Gaza Community Health Programs carried out a study and found that Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) rate for children in Gaza was that 54% suffered from severe PTSD, 33.5% from moderate and 11% from mild and doubtful levels of PTSD. In a report, published in the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, it was estimated that the rate of psychological morbidity in the southern region of Bethlehem in the West Bank, to be 42.3% among Palestinian children. The rate was 46.3% for boys and 37.8% for girls. These rates, the study reported, were twice the rate of psychological morbidity in the Gaza strip.|$|E

500|$|The Olympic Charter limits winter {{sports to}} [...] "those ... which are practised on snow or ice." [...] Since 1992 {{a number of}} new sports {{have been added to the}} Olympic programme; which include short track speed skating, snowboarding, {{freestyle}} and moguls skiing. The addition of these events has broadened the appeal of the Winter Olympics beyond Europe and North America. While European powers such as Norway and Germany still dominate the traditional Winter Olympic sports, countries such as South Korea, Australia and Canada <b>are</b> <b>finding</b> success in the new sports. The results are more parity in the national medal tables, more interest in the Winter Olympics and higher global television ratings.|$|E
500|$|However, {{observation}} and discovery of extragalactic supernovae are now far more common, {{that started with}} SN 1885A in the Andromeda galaxy. Today, amateur and professional astronomers now <b>are</b> <b>finding</b> several hundreds every year, some when near maximum brightness or others unrecognised on old astronomical photographs or plates. American astronomers Rudolph Minkowski and Fritz Zwicky developed the modern supernova classification scheme beginning in 1941. During the 1960s, astronomers found that the maximum intensities of supernovae [...] {{could be used as}} standard candles, hence indicators of astronomical distances. Some of the most distant supernovae recently observed appeared dimmer than expected. This supports the view that {{the expansion of the universe}} is accelerating. Techniques were developed for reconstructing supernovae events that have no written records of being observed. The date of the Cassiopeia A supernova event was determined from light echoes off nebulae, while the age of supernova remnant RX J0852.0-4622 was estimated from temperature measurements and the gamma ray emissions from the radioactive decay of titanium-44.Ti associated with a previously unknown Galactic supernova ...|$|E
