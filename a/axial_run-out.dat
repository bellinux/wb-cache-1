5000|$|<b>Axial</b> <b>run-out</b> {{is caused}} by the tool or {{component}} being at an angle to the axis. <b>Axial</b> <b>run-out</b> causes the tip of the tool (or shaft) to rotate off centre relative to the base. <b>Axial</b> <b>run-out</b> will vary according to how far from the base it is measured.|$|E
50|$|<b>Axial</b> <b>run-out</b> is {{the result}} of a {{rotating}} component not being parallel with the axis, such as a drill chuck not holding the drill exactly in line with the axis. In general, cutting tools are less tolerant of <b>axial</b> <b>run-out</b> since the tool tip tends to dig in and further increase run-out. However a shaft may be more tolerant of <b>axial</b> <b>run-out</b> since the centre of gravity is displaced less.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the initial}} launch the Numark units {{received}} mixed reviews, with several flaws and inadequate quality assurance being pointed out. Some found the tonearm as supplied was not accurately calibrated or properly {{aligned with the}} platter, {{but it can be}} tweaked and adjusted to perform well. The platter in some cases exhibited noticeable warp or <b>axial</b> <b>run-out,</b> which appears to be in part due to the ceramic ring magnetic that secures the platter to the spindle not being glued correctly to the underside of the platter. Some reviewers complained that the pitch system was not calibrated accurately, although not off by much. On later production models, probably the Pro TT-2 only, it is reported that access holes are provided {{on the bottom of the}} turntable base to permit pitch calibration using a screwdriver. Others considered the LCD display to be of little practical value since the pitch value shown is not precise. Also, in some cases the stylus pressure ring on the tonearm counterbalance weight assembly turns much too freely. And, unfortunately, the dust cover hinges eventually fail due to cracking at the bottom of the plastic housing for the counterbalance spring which is under the constant load of the stiff spring. One failed hinge keeps the dust cover from staying open when raised.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{irregular}} run-out is {{the result}} of worn or rough bearings which can manifest itself as either <b>axial</b> or radial <b>run-out.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} reduce error of the wheel run-out {{detection}} system, a harmonic-analysis-based detection method was proposed to enhance the precision of online detection. The moving average filtering method was used for digital filtering between the <b>axial</b> and radial <b>run-out</b> errors so that to decrease the effect of outside noise on the measured data. Practical application shows that this system works stably and reliably on the wheel detection line and it realizes 100 % online detection on the <b>axial</b> and radial <b>run-out</b> of work pieces, with the measurement error lower than 0. 1 mm...|$|R
50|$|The {{wow and flutter}} spec for the Numark Pro TT-2, Pro TT-1+, Pro TT-1 and TT-100 is 0.13%, {{which is}} high {{compared}} to the spec of 0.025% wrms for the Technics SL-1200MK2 and 0.025% wrms for the JVC QL-Y5F turntables. With the Numark turntables the only concentration of mass {{is at the center}} of the platter where the ceramic ring magnet is located. There is no extra mass provided at the circumference of the platter like found on the platters for the Technics and JVC turntables. So the Numark platter exhibits little inertia which is probably why the wow and flutter figure is not up to par. All of the Hanpin made turntables seem to have an inordinately high wow and flutter spec, even their own top of the line models, the DJ-5500 and DJ-3560. The only exception to this for Hanpin made turntables seems to be the ReLoop RP-7000 and RP-8000 which claim a wow and flutter spec of 0.01% wrms. Possibly the ReLoop turntables have a greatly improved platter design to reduce <b>axial</b> <b>run-out</b> of the platter but no mention of that is made in the product literature. If your main use is as a DJ, scratching and playing Hip-Hop, excessive wow and flutter and is probably a non-issue. However if you are an audiophile involved in record restoration, excessive wow and flutter is to be avoided.|$|E
40|$|LectureTwo {{multistage}} barrel type pumps {{were installed}} in {{a nuclear power plant}} in reactor charge application. The pumps are driven by a 600 HP (447 kW) four-pole induction motor through double helical gear increasers. The overall vibration amplitude of the pump casing and the shaft were determined to be acceptable. However, one of the pumps was found with shaft repetitive cracking failures (MTBF = 7. 3 years) initiated away from the key-way stress concentration area, under the later stage impellers, in a zone where fretting was occurring. Several attempts pursued by the plant and their supplier, over the years, did not find the root cause of this shaft cracking problem, in spite of the good troubleshooting procedures and careful installation practices pursued. Therefore, an exceptionally comprehensive root cause investigation was implemented, with specialty vibration testing at its core. Thorough vibration testing combining spectral and timetransient vibration testing on the pump casing and shaft, Experimental Modal Analysis (EMA) testing of the impeller and pump casing, and Operating Deflection Shape (ODS) testing revealed the dynamic behavior of the pump rotor and the entire pump system. The results identified unsuspected excessive axial shuttling of the pump shaft at the motor running speed frequency due to <b>axial</b> <b>run-out</b> of the helical gear set. Based on the test results and supported by non-linear FEA analysis, the authors identified the root cause of the crack initiation phase of the shaft failure. An additional transient FEA based fracture mechanics analysis approach was able to predict that the stresses in the shaft, underneath the impeller, were able to encourage initiation and propagation of the crack. This lecture demonstrates the effectiveness in machinery root cause investigations of thorough vibration testing including ODS, EMA, and FEA rather than traditional troubleshooting approaches, which had not detected a gear/pump inter-related problem, and would not have provided such clear visual evidence for decision makers...|$|E
