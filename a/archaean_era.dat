40|$|International audienceThe {{timing of}} onset of modern-style plate {{tectonics}} is debated. The {{apparent lack of}} blueschist metamorphism 1 [...] a key indicator of modern plate subduction 2 [...] in rocks aged more than about 1 billion years {{calls into question the}} existence of plate tectonics during the <b>Archaean</b> and Palaeoproterozoic <b>eras</b> 3, 4. Instead, plate tectonics and subduction could have either not occurred at that time 5, or could have proceeded differently 6 owing to warmer conditions in the early Earth mantle 7. Here we use thermodynamic models 8, 9, 10 to investigate the formation conditions of metamorphic minerals in the 2. 2 - 2. 0 [*]Gyr old West African metamorphic province. We find a record of blueschist metamorphism in these rocks. We show that minerals such as chlorite and phengite formed at high pressures of 10 - 12 kbar, low temperatures of 400 - 450 [*]°C and under a geothermal gradient of 10 - 12 [*]°C[*]km− 1. These conditions are typical of modern subduction zones. We therefore suggest that modern-style plate tectonics existed during the Palaeoproterozoic era. We conclude that ancient blueschist metamorphism may exist {{in other parts of the}} world, but the identification of these rocks has so far been hampered by methodological problems associated with deciphering their pressure and temperature evolution...|$|R
40|$|The {{provenance}} of the Neoarchaean Ventersdorp Supergroup {{and several}} age-related supracrustal successions was analysed to {{gain insight into}} the geotectonic evolution of the Kaapvaal Craton during {{the transition from the}} <b>Archaean</b> to Proterozoic <b>Eras.</b> The studied successions include, besides the siliciclastic formations of the Ventersdorp Supergroup, the upper Wolkberg and Buffelsfontein Groups, the Godwan Formation and the Schmidtsdrift Subgroup of the basal Transvaal Supergroup in Griqualand West. Petrographic, whole rock geochemical and Sm-Nd isotopic analyses were combined with SHRIMP U-Pb age dating of detrital zircons. Furthermore, Rb-Sr isotopic studies were carried out on carefully selected suites of samples from surface exposure or, wherever possible, on deep diamond drill core. The Ventersdorp Supergroup is an up to 5 km thick undeformed, only slightly metamorphosed volcano-sedimentary succession deposited on the Kaapvaal Craton between 2714 Ma and 2665 Ma. A lack of major time hiati to the underlying Mesoarchaean Witwatersrand Supergroup and covering Neoarchaean to Palaeoproterozoic Transvaal Supergroup render the Ventersdorp Supergroup very well suited for the investigation of the geotectonic evolution of the Kaapvaal Craton near the Archaean-Proterozoic boundary. This is supported by its excellent preservation, which also allowed detailed studies of sedimentological structures, such as seismites indicating Neoarchaean earthquakes. The provenance analyses carried out on the clastic formations of the Ventersdorp Supergroup point to a gradual change in tectonic evolution from typically Archaean to post-Archaean processes rather than a drastic, unique transition {{in the case of the}} Kaapvaal Craton. Texturally immature wackes of the Kameeldoorns Formation, representing the oldest clastic units of the Ventersdorp Supergroup, are derived mainly from Mesoarchaean source rocks, whereas the stratigraphically younger Bothaville Formation displays geochemical signatures comparable with Archaean trondhjemite-tonalite granodiorite-suites (TTGs), thus suggesting crustal addition in the so-called ‘Archaean-style’. The extension of provenance analyses to supracrustal successions that are tentatively correlated with the Bothaville Formation, revealed contributions from granitoid V sources that formed under post-Archaean and Archaean conditions. Furthermore, the geochemical data for all analysed formations support a passive margin setting. Arc settings, as indicated in some samples, are due to the input of less fractionated volcanic material that provides evidence of distal volcanism. Analyses of Nd-isotopic systematics and U-Pb ages of detrital zircons revealed a Mesoarchaean age for the source rocks of the formations. U-Pb age dating of detrital zircons of the Godwan Formation suggests that this formation is of Mesoarchaean age, and therefore not a correlative of the other Neoarchaean successions. Hence, the results suggest that the continental crust of the Kaapvaal Craton was thick enough since the Mesoarchaean (2. 8 - 3. 1 Ga) to allow long-term crustal recycling, and therefore modern plate tectonic processes could have operated earlier than on other well-studied cratonic blocks. During the Neoarchaean, however, crustal thickening of the Kaapvaal Craton took place by accretion of Archaean-style TTGs along the margins of the craton. Thus, Archaean and post-Archaean tectono-magmatic processes co-existed. Furthermore, the Neoarchaean supracrustal successions represent the first sedimentation events on an entirely stabilised and tectonically quiescent Kaapvaal Craton. Input from distal volcanic sources marks the last sign of volcanic activity prior to the craton-wide deposition of carbonate rocks of the Transvaal Supergroup. Geochronological data also imply a connection of the Neoarchaean Kaapvaal Craton to further cratonic blocks that may hold source rocks for the studied formations, as for some small age populations of older detrital zircons (ca. 3. 1 - 3. 4 Ga), no suitable source area could be identified on the Kaapvaal Craton itself. However, it seems unlikely that the Zimbabwe Craton was one of these cratonic blocks, because the Rb-Sr whole rock ages of all studied formations yield a model age of 2092 ± 55 Ma, which is thought to correspond to a craton-wide influence of the 2. 05 Ga old Bushveld Igneous Complex on the Rb-Sr isotope systematics of all analysed clastic successions. This influence is apparently missing in the Southern and Central Marginal Zones of the Limpopo Belt, suggesting that the collision between the Kaapvaal and Zimbabwe Cratons only took place after the emplacement of the Bushveld Igneous Complex, i. e. after 2. 05 Ga.

Consequently the reported study is based on controversial inferences drawn from the moon, other planets and meteorites, coupled with backward extrapolation from surviving terrestrial rocks, especially those of Archaean age. Aspects of accretion are considered, taking into account cosmochemical and cosmophysical evidence, a new earth model, and convection systems. Attention is given to phase-equilibrium constraints, estimates of heat production, the bombardment history of the moon and implications for the earth, {{and the nature of the}} early crust. From a combination of physical, chemical, and petrological arguments, it is concluded that the earth's surface underwent intense volcanism in the pre-Archaean era, and that the rock types were chemically similar to those found in the early <b>Archaean</b> <b>era...</b>|$|E
40|$|Chlorine in the Earth {{is highly}} {{depleted}} relative to carbonaceous chondrites and solar abundances 1.

Here we report that large isotopic differences do not exist, and that carbonaceous chondrites, mantle and crust all have the same 37 Cl/ 35 Cl ratios. We have further analysed crustal sediments from the early <b>Archaean</b> <b>era</b> to the Recent epoch and find no systematic isotopic variations with age, demonstrating that the mantle and crust have always had the same 37 Cl value. The similarity of mantle, crust and carbonaceous chondrites establishes that there were no nebular reservoirs with distinct isotopic compositions, no isotopic fractionation during differentiation of the Earth and no late (post-core formation) Cl-bearing volatile additions to the crustal veneer with a unique isotopic composition...|$|E
40|$|Komatiites are ancient {{volcanic}} rocks, mostly over 2. 7 {{billion years}} old (from the <b>Archaean</b> <b>era),</b> that formed through high degrees of partial melting of the mantle and therefore provide reliable information on bulk mantle compositions 1. In particular, the platinum group element (PGE) contents of komatiites provide a unique source of information on core formation, mantle differentiation and possibly core–mantle interaction 2 - 8. Most of the available PGE data on komatiites are from late Archaean (~ 2. 7 – 2. 9 [*]Gyr old) or early Proterozoic (2. 0 – 2. 5 [*]Gyr old) samples. Here we show that most early Archaean (3. 5 – 3. 2 [*]Gyr old) komatiites from the Barberton greenstone belt of South Africa and the Pilbara craton of Western Australia are depleted in PGE relative to late Archaean and younger komatiites. Early Archaean komatiites record a signal of PGE depletion in the lower mantle, resulting from core formation. This signal diminishes with time owing to progressive mixing-in to the deep mantle of PGE-enriched cosmic material that the Earth accreted as the ‘late veneer’ during the Early Archaean (4. 5 – 3. 8 [*]Gyr ago) meteorite bombardment...|$|E
40|$|The {{compositional}} {{differences between}} mid-ocean-ridge and ocean-island basalts place important {{constraints on the}} form of mantle convection 1, 2. Also, {{it is thought that}} the scale and nature of heterogeneities within plumes {{and the degree to which}} heterogeneous material endures within the mantle might be reflected in spatial variations of basalt composition observed at the Earth's surface. Here we report osmium isotope data on lavas from a transect across the Azores archipelago which vary in a symmetrical pattern across what is thought to be a mantle plume. Many of the lavas from the centre of the plume have lower 187 Os/ 188 Os ratios than most ocean-island basalts and some extend to subchondritic 187 Os/ 188 Os ratios—lower than any yet reported from ocean-island basalts. These low ratios require derivation from a depleted, harzburgitic mantle, consistent with the low-iron signature of the Azores plume. Rhenium-depletion model ages extend to 2. 5 Gyr, and we infer that the osmium isotope signature is unlikely to be derived from Iberian subcontinental lithospheric mantle. Instead, we interpret the osmium isotope signature as having a deep origin and infer that it may be recycled, Archaean oceanic mantle lithosphere that has delaminated from its overlying oceanic crust. If correct, our data provide evidence for deep mantle subduction and storage of oceanic mantle lithosphere during the <b>Archaean</b> <b>era...</b>|$|E
40|$|Although plate {{tectonics}} {{is the central}} geological process of the modern Earth, its form and existence during the <b>Archaean</b> <b>era</b> (4. 0 - 2. 5 Gyr ago) are disputed. The existence of subduction during this time is particularly controversial because characteristic subduction-related mineral assemblages, typically documenting apparent geothermal gradients of 15 °C km- 1 or less, {{have not yet been}} recorded from in situ Archaean rocks (the lowest recorded apparent geothermal gradients are greater than 25 °C km - 1). Despite this absence from the rock record, low Archaean geothermal gradients are suggested by eclogitic nodules in kimberlites and circumstantial evidence for subduction processes, including possible accretion-related structures, has been reported in Archaean terrains. The lack of spatially and temporally well-constrained high-pressure, low-temperature metamorphism continues, however, to cast doubt on the relevance of subduction-driven tectonics during the first 1. 5 Gyr of the Earth's history. Here we report garnet-albite-bearing mineral assemblages that record pressures of 1. 2 - 1. 5 GPa at temperatures of 600 - 650 °C from supracrustal amphibolites from the mid-Archaean Barberton granitoid-greenstone terrain. These conditions point to apparent geothermal gradients of 12 - 15 °C-similar to those found in recent subduction zones-that coincided with the main phase of terrane accretion in the structurally overlying Barberton greenstone belt. These high-pressure, low-temperature conditions represent metamorphic evidence for cold and strong lithosphere, as well as subduction-driven tectonic processes, during the evolution of the early Earth. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.

40|$|Stable {{continental}} regions, {{free from}} tectonic activity, are generally found only within ancient cratons—the centres of continents which {{formed in the}} <b>Archaean</b> <b>era,</b> 4. 0 – 2. 5 Gyr ago. But in the Cordilleran mountain belt of western North America some younger (middle Proterozoic) regions have remained stable, whereas some older (late Archaean) regions have been tectonically disturbed, suggesting that age alone does not determine lithospheric strength and crustal stability. Here we report rhenium–osmium isotope and mineral compositions of peridotite xenoliths from two regions of the Cordilleran mountain belt. We found that the younger, undeformed Colorado plateau is underlain by lithospheric mantle that is 'depleted' (deficient in minerals extracted by partial melting of the rock), whereas the older (Archaean), yet deformed, southern Basin and Range province is underlain by 'fertile' lithospheric mantle (not depleted by melt extraction). We suggest that the apparent relationship between composition and lithospheric strength, inferred from different degrees of crustal deformation, occurs because depleted mantle is intrinsically less dense than fertile mantle (due to iron having been lost when melt was extracted from the rock). This allows the depleted mantle to form a thicker thermal boundary layer between the deep convecting mantle and the crust, thus reducing tectonic activity at the surface. The inference that not all Archaean crust developed a strong and thick thermal boundary layer leads {{to the possibility that}} such ancient crust may have been overlooked because of its intensive reworking or lost from the geological record owing to preferential recycling...|$|E
40|$|The {{notion that}} {{ultraviolet}} (UV) fluxes, and thus biologically weighted irradiances, were higher on Archaean Earth than on present-day Earth {{has been a}} pervasive influence on thinking concerning the nature of early Earth. It directly influences calculations concerning protection strategies {{that may or may}} not have been required by early life. Our knowledge of the Earth's changing UV radiation climate over time depends upon our knowledge of a diversity of factors, the magnitudes of which are uncertain. Here these uncertainties are explored. During the <b>Archaean</b> <b>Era,</b> calculations of the surface photobiological environment span a three order of magnitude difference in DNA-damage weighted irradiances with consequences for our assumptions concerning the environment for exposed surface life and the role of UV radiation as a mutagen. These differences are primarily caused by uncertainties in the concentrations of trace gases and the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and nitrogen that affect scattering in the atmosphere. To a lesser extent, the luminosity of the Sun in the UV region is also a factor. During the Proterozoic and Phanerozoic, when we know that an ozone column existed, these uncertainties drop to two orders of magnitude and are primarily caused by poor knowledge about the frequency and atmospheric effects of potentially ozone-depleting agents such as volcanism, impact events and supernovae explosions as well as the effects of global temperatures on ozone concentrations and thus surface UV irradiance. Changes in other atmospheric constituents during this time have less of an effect on photobiological consequences, which include a Palaeozoic oxygen pulse. Understanding the cause of photobiological uncertainties and their consequences constitutes a current challenge for atmospheric chemists and photobiologists...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Archaean</b> <b>era</b> {{lasted for}} {{about one third}} of the Earth's history, from ca 4. 0 until 2. 5 billion years ago. Because the Archaean spans such a long time, {{knowledge}} about this era is for understanding the evolution of the Earth until the present day, especially because it is the time offormation of much of the Earth 's continental However, because it was a very long time ago, this period is difficult to study; the geological record contains a limited amount of rocks that date from this era. Hutton's doctrine of uniformitarianism; present {{is the key to the}} past" may be in a general sense. The Archaean Earth may have had a stmcture very much like it does today: it probably had a core, a convecting mantle, a crust, oceans, and an atmosphere. However, on closer inspection there are many differences between the present day and the Archaean Earth. During the Archaean the earliest life on Earth evolved. Geodynamic processes may also have been significantly different and they are the focus of this thesis. There is still much controversy about whether modern-style plate tectonics, characterized by rigid plates, spreading and subduction of ocean floor, recycling of oceanic crust, generation of continental crust, and continental growth by lateral accretion ofterranes, were possible in the Archaean (see papers in Coward and Ries, 1995; De Wit and Ashwal, 1997). Thermal and geodynamical modeling studies have not provided conclusive answers, mainly because the temperature of the interior of the Earth in the Archaean still is a major unknown. Geological field studies can potentially provide the data necessary to constrain the thermal, tectonic and geodynamic regimes of the early, mid and late Archaean. Modern plate tectonics can be defined by several characteristic features, however, some of these are very difficult to identify in ancient rocks. The main problem is that the ocean floor plays tbe leading role in the plate tectonic process, but it is this same ocean floor which is continuously recycled, and not preserved and accessible to field studies. We bave to look for features that were preserved on the continents. Most diagnostic are those that are directly related to subduction, such as ophiolites (obducted slices ofoceanic crust), accretionary tectonic melanges (formed at the leading edge of the overriding plate), and the occurrence of high pressure-low temperature metamorphic rocks at the surface (indicating tbal rocks have been taken down to great depths and subsequentlyexhumed). Other characteristic features are tbe occurrence ofmagmatic products from subducted ocean floor and subduction-modified mantle; the widespread occurrence of intermediate magmatism, and compression-extension tectonic cycles followed by major strike-slip events. These characteristic features have been researched in the Archaean Pilbara Craton in Western Australia, in the context of this PhD thesis focusing on the West and Central Pilbara. A temporally constrained structuralkinematic framework supported by petrology and geochemistry is built, in order to assess possible geodynamic regimes in the mid-Archaean...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} the first continents on Earth marks {{a major change in}} the early {{planetary}} evolution. The knowledge about that is controversial as most of the scarce accessible samples from deep cratonic lithosphere (the rigid mantle underneath the continents) hide their earliest records beneath secondary overprints during the last three billion years. This thesis investigates fragments of such old (> 3 Ga) subcontinental lithospheric mantle, which occur as isolated rock bodies (orogenic peridotites) in crustal gneiss exposed on Otry in the mountain chain of the Scandinavian Caledonides in western Norway. The Otry mantle fragments are compositionally banded and include garnet peridotite, spinel peridotite, garnetite and garnet pyroxenite. Garnet is associated with tiny lamellae and comparably coarse grains of pyroxene in two mineral microstructures. The pyroxene lamellae and the host garnet have a strong crystallographic relationship (symmetry multiples of 4 x 3 orientations), which characterise this type of microstructure as a break down product of a former majorite precursor mineral. Majorite is a typical component of the deep mantle (> 150 km depth). In-situ analyses of rare Earth elements (REE) in the majorite break down products reveal that the break down reaction occurred at minimum temperatures of 1300 C. Sm-Nd and Re-Os isotopes constrain the origin of most rock types between c. 3. 3 - 2. 9 Ga, in the <b>Archaean</b> <b>era.</b> Both temperature and age information demonstrate that the occurrence of the ultra-high pressure mineral indicator majorite in orogenic peridotites does not necessarily record conditions of the latest major geodynamic overprint, deep continental subduction, as recently proposed for other orogens. Pyroxene grains associated with garnet in the other microstructure record similar initial minimum temperatures and have similar exceptionally low concentrations of light REE as pyroxene lamellae. This implies that the Otry mantle fragments originated at much greater depth (> 350 km) than the thickness of the oldest continents (c. 200 km). Mineral microstructures, mineral chemistry and melt modelling constrain that an up-welling, extremely hot (> 1800 C) mantle caused melting and emplacement of the peridotites at c. 150 km depth forming an ultra-depleted cratonic root in the early Earth. Subsequent metasomatism enriched locally the melt depleted peridotites in melt-compatible elements (Fe, Ca and light REE), but also in Cr and heavy REE, elements which are generally regarded as melt-incompatible. Metasomatised peridotites preserve Archaean ages and have higher Cr content than primitive mantle. Cr and heavy REE are interpreted to be mobile during high degrees of peridotite melting (c. 50 %) at high pressures (c. 5 GPa). Sub-cratonic emplacement of the peridotites may have caused strong deformation, which explains the present compositional layering by mechanical mixing of garnet-rich and garnet-poor lithologies. Folding and recrystallization of this layering occurred during tectonic exhumation of the mantle fragments associated with the Caledonian orogeny more than 2 billion years later. Recrystallized assemblages lack pyroxene microstructures in garnet, preserve peak metamorphic conditions of 870 C and 6. 5 GPa (corresponding to c. 200 km depth) and have early Scandian ages of c. 430 Ma. This shows that continental subduction during orogeny in western Norway exceeded deep into the diamond stability field. The ultra-high pressure metamorphism appears to have lasted significantly longer than generally accepted in this region. Nevertheless witnesses of lithosphere formation during early Earth evolution are preserved within the peridotite bodies, demonstrating that the Scandian tectonometamorphic overprint did not wipe out the earlier records as is generally thought by the scientific community. This recognition allows early Earth lithospheric studies to be performed in a totally new geological setting...|$|E
