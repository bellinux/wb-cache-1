40|$|Abstract—To {{address the}} need for {{fundamental}} universally valid definitions of exact bandwidth and quality factor () of <b>tuned</b> <b>antennas,</b> as well as {{the need for}} efficient accurate approximate formulas for computing this bandwidth and, exact and approximate expressions are found for the bandwidth and of a general single-feed (one-port) lossy or lossless linear <b>antenna</b> <b>tuned</b> to resonance or antiresonance. The approximate expression derived for the exact bandwidth of a <b>tuned</b> <b>antenna</b> differs from previous approximate expressions in that it is inversely proportional to the magnitude 0 (0) of the frequency derivative of the input impedance and, for not too large a bandwidth, it is nearly equal to the exact bandwidth of the <b>tuned</b> <b>antenna</b> at every frequency 0, that is, throughout antiresonant as well as resonant frequency bands. It is also shown that an appropriately defined exact of a tuned lossy or lossless antenna is approximately proportional to 0 (0) and thus this is approximately inversely proportional to the bandwidth (for not too large a bandwidth) of a simply <b>tuned</b> <b>antenna</b> at all frequencies. The exact of a <b>tuned</b> <b>antenna</b> is defined in terms of average internal energies that emerge naturally from Maxwell’s equations applied to the <b>tuned</b> <b>antenna.</b> These internal energies, which are similar but not identical to previously defined quality-factor energies, and the associated are proven to increase without bound as the size of an antenna is decreased. Numerical solutions to thin straight-wire and wire-loop lossy and lossless antennas, as well as to a Yagi antenna and a straight-wire antenna embedded in a lossy dispersive dielectric, confirm the accuracy of the approximate expressions and the inverse relationship between the defined bandwidth and the defined over frequency ranges that cover several resonant and antiresonant frequency bands.

50|$|<b>Antenna</b> <b>tuning</b> is best done {{as close}} to the antenna as {{possible}} to minimize loss, increase bandwidth, and reduce voltage and current on the transmission line.

Analog TV and FM stereo broadcasts are affected in this way. For those modes, matching at the antenna is required.|$|E

The impedance match over tuning is maintained by a properly chosen reactive element in series with the antenna. Both polarizations of the dual-polarized <b>antennas</b> are <b>tuned</b> independently—enabling either simultaneous frequency- and polarization-agility, or operation at two independent frequencies on orthogonal polarizations. First, the tunability of the slot-ring antenna is demonstrated with fixed-capacitor loading, and then, single and dual-polarized slot-ring <b>antennas</b> are <b>tuned</b> from 0. 95 – 1. 8 GHz and 0. 93 – 1. 6 GHz, respectively, using varactor diodes.
