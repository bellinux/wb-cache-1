40|$|The {{insurance}} {{mechanism is}} an efficient tool for managing risks {{that meet the}} insurable risk requirements {{of a large number}} of independent exposure units for which good information exists for calculating premiums. This research examines the case in which risks do not meet these requirements and risk bearing is costly. Two main areas are addressed. First, the effect of catastrophic losses on the insurance market ex post is examined to determine how insurers respond to large, unanticipated changes in surplus. Second, the effect of catastrophic losses on the insurance market ex ante is examined in order to assess how the cost of risk determines the supply function for individual insurers. The main hypothesis tested is whether or not insurers with a lower cost of risk bearing, or lower Variance Related Costs (VRCs), will assume a higher exposure to risk. To test the hypothesis, measures of risk and Variance Related Costs are needed. Risk is measured as the proportion of an insurer 2 ̆ 7 s surplus at risk from a catastrophic earthquake, and since Variance Related Costs are not observable, proxies are used. The proxies used for VRCs are organizational form, marketing system, leverage, profitability, tax position, and diversification. Tests are performed to verify whether or not insurers with lower VRCs assume more risk. The results are very supportive of the VRC model: Firms with a higher cost of bearing risk assume less risk. The existence of costly risk bearing implies that not all insurers <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> <b>equipped</b> to insure high variance lines of insurance. Instead, an efficient market solution requires that those firms with a comparative advantage in risk bearing should assume a greater share of the risk, and the results indicate that this does occur in the market for earthquake insurance. ...|$|E

One of the outcomes of this inward migration was that the children of immigrants entered the UK higher education (HE) systems in order to maximise their life opportunities. Despite their entrance in HE, there is a body of evidence showing that an educational attainment gap at degree level exists between BME students and their White counterparts, even when {{at the point of}} entry BME students and their counterparts have nearly identical entry grades, hence showing they <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> <b>equipped.</b> The shortfall between the performance of BME and White students has implications for the sector and society per se. So that a better understanding for the rationale of the degree attainment gap could be gained, adding to the quantitative research demonstrating this gap, 20 qualitative research interviews amongst first and second generation university attendees were completed. To support this work, a case based study approach at Coventry University was undertaken which enabled {{a deeper understanding of the}} reasons for specific attainment. The research findings reveal that a number of factors have an influence. The factors are external, namely previous experience at school and the route taken to reach HE, course aspects in relation to the one that is chosen and teaching staff. Internal factors centre on attitudes and aspirations, peers and the individual’s knowledge of HE. The final area to emerge is a middle ground, the image of the institution and its ability to make students feel welcome. Educationalists can do little to influence external factors; however, institutions must take action, through curricular changes, course materials and attitudes of tutors, to minimise their negative impact upon attainment. Attainment statistics demonstrate that the gap has started to reduce; however, it still needs addressing further as degree attainment has the ability to impact individuals’ lives and their employment opportunities. Institutional actions can improve the attainment of all HE students...|$|E

Furthermore, we show by direct surface staining that CD 8 + DC, but not CD 8 - DC, express FasL at high levels.

40|$|Farming {{activities}} can be assumed {{to be one of}} several driving forces which lead to continuous deterioration processes of tree and bush savannahs in the Kavango Region of northeastern Namibia. However, these farming {{activities can}} be assumed to be closely connected with securing subsistence needs of peasant farmers. In this context, the present study aims to a) empirically identify objectives of peasant farmers, b) quantify their most prevailing and other possible on-farm and off-farm activities, c) identify optimal farming strategies under important system constraints and their impacts on environmental and socioeconomic aspects and d) identify policyinduced changes to the previously identified optimal farming strategies. Results of this study are intended to a) serve as a solution point for similar problems in related ecological or economic systems and b) be relevant for policy makers to investigate policy impacts on peasant farming strategies. Chapter 2 addresses some major challenges of the Namibian economy. In particular, the agricultural sector and the peasant farming system of the Kavango Region are described. In this environment, agricultural activities are predominantly subsistenceoriented and embedded in a semi-commercial system of imperfect markets. The prevailing farmingsystem comprises of three major elements: a) crop production, b) livestock production and c) natural resource production. By a varying degree, all elements contribute to food security, cash income or domestic usage patterns. Hence, an important internal driving force which causes (over) usage or depletion of natural resources is the obligation to secure substantial living needs. This aspect is further discussed by giving an outline of a) environmental and socioeconomic threats as well as b) possible coping strategies. Chapter 3 illustrates the theoretical background of the present study by discussing two different methodological approaches. Peasant farmers in the research area can be as-sumed to be both producers and consumers. This aspect determines the first considered methodological approach. Several concepts of farm household (FHH) models reflect non-separability under specific assumptions and imply certain benefits and limitations. This study uses a FHH model which is primary based on Barnum and Squire. However, it is supplemented by features from Chayanov and Low. Economic farm activities are influenced by the natural resource base and vice versa. This aspect determines the second considered methodological approach. In order to reflect economic and environmental dynam-ics, bio-economic models (BEM) are wellknown tools. Hence, important facets of BEMs and their applications to various research tasks and areas are briefly outlined. This study develops a multiannual programming optimisation model (MAPOM) which is based on theories of FHHs and BEMs. MAPOM represents a typical village with two non-separable and non-interacting gender-specific FHH categories and includes some bio-physical features. Both FHH categories <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> <b>equipped</b> with several farm assets but follow different objectives. Utility is maximised for both FHH categories by consuming several goods and services which are generated by participating in different farm and off-farm activities. One major constraint which needs to be respected is food security. Biophysical dynamics are addressed by a) including rainfall in all on-farm production functions, b) updating the resource base each year and c) calculating a ‘native biomass loss’ index for each farming element. Chapter 4 consists of two parts which describe the data base of MAPOM. Primary data is predominantly obtained by a case study on farming systems (CSFS). Outcomes of the CSFS build the basis of all relevant parameter calculation processes (e. g. static input-output relationships). Moreover, a review of region-specific publications is supplemented to validate calculation outcomes and to fill data gaps. In a second part, this chapter de-picts the methodological approach of a traditional conjoint analysis (TCA). This method is used to identify objectives of peasant farmers. A brief outline of the research design is specified after a description of the theoretical foundation of TCAs and their applications in developing countries. Results of this analysis generated weighting factors for the arguments of the objective function used in MAPOM. Since these results showed some gender specifications, MAPOM distinguishes in this point between female and male-headed FHH. Chapter 5 presents the model framework and the mathematical model formulations. Generally, it embeds the previously determined static input-output combinations in dy-namic ecological and economic relationships, in terms of equations. These equations are specified for each farming element and off-farm activity in MAPOM. Moreover, the most important consumption patterns are outlined along with production functions. As an example, equations are specified for cattle dynamics, annual growth of native biomass and population dynamics. Linkages of the different farming system elements become apparent in exchange relationships specifically between livestock and crop production. In addition, attention is paid to the description of system-related constraints. They are imple-mented in MAPOM to mirror the prevailing conditions in the research area. A final section presents the development of the objective function. Chapter 6 illustrates the results of four different scenarios simulated by MAPOM. In general, all different farming elements and off-farm activities are represented to a varying degree in the optimal solution of the baseline scenario. Cattle production plays a minor role in optimal farming strategies. Results indicate that land and labour are limiting fac-tors. A trade-off between food security and native biomass conservation is apparent. To some degree, native biomass could be potentially conserved without tremendously threat-ening food security. Scenario 2 involves a modification of the cattlekeeping element in the objective function. Then, cattle production is slightly intensified at the costs of crop production activities. Simultaneously, overcompensations of nutrition requirements and potentials of native biomass conservation are reduced. Scenario 3 addresses the enforcement of a fee system for natural resources usage and considers an increased land endowment. Impacts of these changes on optimal farming strategies are rather small. However, in some cases farmers use even more land for cultivation, instead of conserving native natural resources. In a final scenario, weighting factors in the objective function are modified. Generally, average weighting factors (over both genders) are suitable to reflect optimal farming strategies of both genders to some degree. Contrarily, equal weighting factors underestimate or overestimate optimal production levels. Hence, they do not reflect actual native biomass destruction potentials. Results of all scenarios indicated that FHHs are highly attracted to labour-saving technologies or activities which demand little labour. Hence, family labour {{is one of the most}} prominent limiting factors. This factor might, however, be threatened in the future by several socioeconomic developments. Therefore, it seems to be of high relevance to promote labour-saving devices for the different farming activities of peasant farmers in the research area...|$|E

The aim {{of the present study}} was to collect experiences of workplace health promotion for older workers (WHPOW) conducted in 10 representative countries of Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean. MethodsA literature review of activities of WHPOW was conducted through a comprehensive search of major scientific databases and on the website of the major European Agencies on worker health promotion. The search was restricted to papers published in English from 2000 to 2015. Companies were asked for additional documentation about WHPOW programmes in a survey conducted with SurveyMonkey. ResultsA total of 756 initiatives regarding WHPOW were identified. 134 of these were guidelines, regulations, or review studies. The remaining 622 activities were intervention studies performed or promoted in the workplace and targeted at older workers or at the aging of {{the workforce}}.

In order to elucidate the role of Bcl- 2 and Bax during kidney development, it is essential to establish the exact location of their expression in the kidney. The present study localized their expression during kidney development. Kidneys from embryonic (E) 16 -, 17 -, 18 -day-old mouse fetuses, and postnatal (P) 1 -, 3 -, 5 -, 7 -, 14 -, 21 -day-old pups were embedded in Epon. Semi-thin serial sections from two E 17 kidneys underwent computer assisted 3 D tubule tracing. The tracing was combined with a newly developed immunohistochemical technique, which enables immunohistochemistry on glutaraldehyde fixated plastic embedded sections. Thereby, the microstructure could be described in detail, and the immunochemistry can be performed using exactly the same sections. The study showed that Bcl- 2 and Bax were strongly expressed in mature proximal convoluted tubules at all time points, less strongly expressed in proximal straight tubules, and only weakly in immature proximal tubules and distal tubules. No expression was detected in ureteric bud and other earlier developing structures, such as comma bodies, S shaped bodies, glomeruli, etc. Tubules expressing Bcl- 2 only were occasionally observed. The present study showed that, during kidney development, Bcl- 2 and Bax are expressed differently in the proximal and distal tubules, although these two tubule segments <b>are</b> almost <b>equally</b> <b>equipped</b> with mitochondria. The functional significance of the different expression of Bcl- 2 and Bax in proximal and distal tubules is unknown. However, the findings of the present study suggest that the mitochondrial function differs between mature proximal tubules and in the rest of the tubules. The function of Bcl- 2 and Bax during tubulogenesis still needs to be investigated...|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} the present {{dissertation}} is argumentation in the late statesman Olof Palme (1927 - 1986). One may reasonably think that the fascination for Palme is mainly due to his way of expressing his policy, and therefore also to his argumentation strategy. The theoretical background consists of Lloyd F. Bitzers’s theory on the rhetorical situation, Stephen E. Toulmin’s theory on the description of argumentation structures and {{on the notion of}} fallacy, as it appears in pragma-dialectics and informal logic. The rhetorical situation is used to identify vital presuppositions and conditions surrounding the analysed argumentation. Toulmin’s theoretical model is used to analyse structures in the argumentation, and the notion of fallacy is used to discover infringements upon these structures. The object of this analysis is the decisive electoral debates of autumn 1976 between Olof Palme and Thorbjörn Fälldin, held in Scandinavium, Gothenburg, Sweden. Palme had to think of a number of surrounding conditions, such as that the debate was decisive, the composition of the audience. Palme and Fälldin otherwise appeared to <b>be</b> rather <b>equally</b> <b>equipped</b> for the debate. Palme’s task was primarily to gain the number of votes needed to continue to keep social democracy in power. There seem to exist several levels making up his argumentation, grouped under attack and defence. Defence is in most cases based upon a strong connection with the social democrat tradition. The attack is more complicated, linked to Palme’s overall argumentative intention: to depict the non-socialists as a bad governing alternative, and the social democrats as a better one. Fallacies are regarded as instances of breaking the frame of rules that govern a critical discussion. Palme has several fallacy-like features in his argumentation. Among those, most common, are that he attacks the person Thorbjörn Fälldin, instead of the policy or party that he represents. Palme also starts from presupposed premises and tries to link the economic policy of the alliance to an intellectually-thought delimiting between liberal and conservative capitalism and social-democrat solidarity. He strives to portray the liberals and conservatives as money-orientated, whereas social democracy is depicted as people-orientated. Palme goes arguably too far at several moments during the debate,which possibly hurts his own argumentation.

SDML includes both synchronous and asynchronous learning modes. During the initial stage of our project, we regularly transmitted a lecture from a specially equipped lecture room in one university to an <b>equally</b> <b>equipped</b> lecture room in another university using ATM technology. The project is evaluated with consideration to technical and pedagogical issues. A variety of technical problems could be addressed during the regular transmission of the lecture for {{the course of a}} semester. Empirical data suggested that the remote students were appreciating the new technologies, whereas the local students seemed to be somewhat sceptical. Moreover, the organisational problems in setting up a semi-virtual university seem to be vastly underestimated in comparison to the technical issues. 1 Introduction In G [...] ...|$|R
