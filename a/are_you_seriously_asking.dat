6000|$|... "Upon my word," [...] said Emma, [...] "I {{begin to}} doubt my having any such talent. Can <b>you</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>ask</b> me, Harriet, whether I {{imagined}} him attached to another {{woman at the}} very time that I was--tacitly, if not openly--encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?--I never had the slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of Mr. Frank Churchill's having the least regard for Jane Fairfax. <b>You</b> may <b>be</b> very sure that if I had, I should have cautioned you accordingly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As I remarked just now," [...] he proceeded, [...] "newspaper {{reports are}} not always to <b>be</b> trusted. Do <b>you</b> <b>seriously</b> mean, my dear sir, to marry Mrs. Norman?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You don't mean to say, father, that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> talking <b>seriously</b> {{of these}} men--your friends--whom we see every day--and our only company?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your excuse is 'pressure of business.' The truth (as I {{have good}} reason to believe) is 'want of money.' I heard a stranger, at that public meeting, say that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>seriously</b> embarrassed by some failure in the City.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{not used}} to Americans, my young friend," [...] he said. [...] "Over on this side <b>you</b> <b>are</b> all so fearfully literal. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> not <b>seriously</b> supposing that they meant to dose me with that stuff the other night, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|MISS REED: [...] "Oh, that's no reason! I {{can prove}} to <b>you</b> that <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> Who else {{but you would}} have taken in a {{homeless}} and friendless creature like me, and let her stay bothering round in demoralizing idleness, while <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>seriously</b> teaching the young idea how to drub the piano?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad indeed, Mikail," [...] Godfrey said, as he {{lay down}} beside the {{starosta}} that night, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> not <b>seriously</b> hurt. I only heard to-day {{that you had a}} wife waiting for you outside." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Permit me to hope," [...] {{said the}} Counsellor, coming up--"permit me to hope, {{now that this}} affair seems to <b>be</b> over, that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not <b>seriously</b> hurt. Had <b>you</b> not better allow Doctor Blake to {{ascertain}} whether the bullet still remains in you? had you not better sit down?" ...|$|R
25|$|Lodge: Well, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a {{chief of}} state. I cannot give you advice, but personally, {{and as a}} friend, and as {{somebody}} who is concerned about your health, my suggestion would <b>be</b> <b>you</b> think <b>seriously</b> of getting away. Now, if I can be of any help on that, I'm prepared to send my driver with an officer of mine to escort you to safety. And we can get you on my jet aircraft, and I'm sure I can deliver on that. One of my officers will ride {{in the front seat}} of my limousine with the chauffeur.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed," [...] she replied; [...] "I do {{not want}} to hear a word about them, but I am going to give you one piece of advice, {{whether you like it or}} not. Don't be in a hurry to ask her to marry you. At this moment she does not want to marry anybody. Her {{position}} has entirely changed. She wanted to marry so that her plans might be settled before her father and his new wife arrive; and now she considers that they are settled. So be careful. It is true that the objections she formerly had to <b>you</b> <b>are</b> removed, but before you ask her to marry <b>you,</b> <b>you</b> should <b>seriously</b> <b>ask</b> yourself what reason there is she should do so. She does not know you very well; she is not interested in you; and I am very sure she is not in love with you. Now you know, for I have told you so, that I would be delighted to see you two married. I believe you would suit each other admirably, but although you may agree with me in this opinion, I am quite sure she does not; at least, not yet. Now, this is all I am going to say, except that you have my very best wishes that you may get her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come," [...] I protested, [...] "that {{is not at}} all fair. I {{can assure}} <b>you</b> that I <b>was</b> taking <b>you</b> most <b>seriously.</b> The people who get most out of life are the people who avoid the {{analytical}} attitude, who enjoy but who do not seek to understand, who worship form and external beauty without the desire to penetrate below to understand the inner meaning of what they find so beautiful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{begin to}} think myself I have made a mistake, Alexis, in {{choosing}} this route instead of a northern one. Besides, we shall have winter upon us in a very few weeks now, which would of course add tremendously to our difficulties. But <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not <b>seriously</b> thinking of stopping here, are you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Having {{promised to}} comply with the strange request which he had {{addressed}} to me, I ventured to remind him of past occasions on which he had pointedly abstained, when the subject presented itself, from speaking of the girls' ages. [...] "You have left it to my discretion," [...] I added, [...] "to decide a question in which <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>seriously</b> interested, relating to your daughters. Have I no excuse for regretting that I have not been admitted to your confidence a little more freely?" ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Be</b> consistent- if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{to enforce}} rules and regulations, {{make sure to}} do so {{regularly}} so your subordinates take <b>you</b> <b>seriously.</b> This will form a stronger level of trust.|$|R
5000|$|Later, Hitler is {{informed}} by Krebs and Alfred Jodl that Steiner could not mount the attack, allowing the Red Army to further advance closer to Berlin. Dismissing everyone from the room except for Keitel, Jodl, Krebs, Burgdorf and Goebbels, Hitler flies into a furious rage against what he perceives are traitorous actions against him and finally acknowledges {{that the war is}} lost. However, he is determined to stay in Berlin to the end, even if it means killing himself, saying [...] "But, gentlemen, if you believe I'm going to leave Berlin, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>seriously</b> mistaken. I'd rather blow my brains out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “No, Christina, not to-day,” he said. “To-day I {{have to talk}} to <b>you</b> <b>seriously.</b> Sit ye down, please, {{there where}} <b>you</b> <b>were.</b> Please!” he repeated.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} old man. [...] "The young suffer terribly. But they recover. Afterward we don't suffer so much, but we don't recover. I wouldn't defend you against {{yourself}} if I thought <b>you</b> <b>seriously</b> in the wrong. If you know yourself to <b>be,</b> <b>you</b> shouldn't let me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you mean," [...] she interrupted, [...] "do <b>you</b> <b>seriously</b> {{mean that}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> ignorant {{as to who}} I really am, as to any part of my history?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Christina, not to-day," [...] he said. [...] "To-day I {{have to talk}} to <b>you</b> <b>seriously.</b> Sit ye down, please, {{there where}} <b>you</b> <b>were.</b> Please!" [...] he repeated.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are {{you sure}} of yourself, Allan?" [...] he asked, {{with his face}} bent once more over the book. [...] "Are you really {{attached}} to this lady? Have <b>you</b> thought <b>seriously</b> already of <b>asking</b> her to be your wife?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Edmund, sighing and musing {{for some}} {{minutes before he}} again spoke, {{and then it was}} very earnestly. [...] "Marian, you must not go wrong, Gerald must not--with such parents as yours----." [...] Marian did not answer, for she could not; and {{presently}} he added, [...] "It does seem strange that such care as my uncle's should have been given to me, and then his own boy left thus. But, Marian, you must watch him, you must guard him. If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> in real difficulty or doubt how to act, you have the Wortleys; and if you see anything about which <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>seriously</b> uneasy with regard to him, write to me, and I will do my utmost, little as that is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear--I do wish I knew whether <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{a boy or}} a girl. Do <b>you</b> <b>seriously</b> {{suggest that}} I should engage you as my housekeeper?" [...] asked Mr. Peter Hope, now upright {{with his back to the}} fire.|$|R
5000|$|Actress Whoopi Goldberg <b>seriously</b> <b>asked</b> on The View, [...] "Why is {{the flag}} rippling? There’s no air." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are pleased}} to be sarcastic," [...] said Lady Casterley. [...] "Listen to me! It's the {{greatest}} nonsense to suppose that people in our caste are free to do as they please. The sooner you realize that, the better, Babs. I <b>am</b> talking to <b>you</b> <b>seriously.</b> The preservation of our position as a class depends on our observing certain decencies. What do you imagine {{would happen to the}} Royal Family if they were allowed to marry as they liked? All this marrying with Gaiety girls, and American money, and people with pasts, and writers, and so forth, is most damaging. There's far too much of it, and it ought to be stopped. It may be tolerated for a few cranks, or silly young men, and these new women, but for Eustace--" [...] Lady Casterley paused again, and her fingers pinched Barbara's arm, [...] "or for you--there's only one sort of marriage possible. As for Eustace, I shall speak to this good lady, and see that he doesn't get entangled further." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it {{possible}} that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> in earnest?" [...] Catherine <b>asked.</b> [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>seriously</b> thought of the advice that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> giving me? Setting aside the deceit, {{you know as well}} as I do that Kitty would ask questions. Do you think I can tell my child that her father is dead? A lie--and such a dreadful lie as that?" ...|$|R
60|$|MR MARCH. You mightn't think it, but I'm {{talking to}} <b>you</b> <b>seriously.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "My opinion <b>is</b> (since <b>you</b> ask it) that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{greatly to}} blame for playing pranks upon a man like Mr. Boldwood, merely as a pastime. Leading on a man you don't care for is not a praiseworthy action. And even, Miss Everdene, if <b>you</b> <b>seriously</b> {{inclined}} towards him, you might have let him find it out in some way of true loving-kindness, and not by sending him a valentine's letter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, reprobate! <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a castaway--be off, or I'll hurt <b>you</b> <b>seriously!</b> I'll have <b>you</b> all {{modelled}} in wax and clay! and {{the first}} who passes the limits I fix shall--I'll not say what he shall be done to--but, you'll see! Go, I'm looking at you!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did <b>you</b> <b>seriously</b> think, dear, that {{we could}} have deceived Mr. Bentley? Then <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not as clever as I thought you. As soon as it {{happened}} I sent him a note? that very night. For I felt that he ought to be told first of all." ...|$|R
40|$|I suppose every law professor, at {{one time}} or another, has mused about writing a casebook. 2 ̆ 2 This one I 2 ̆ 7 m using is OK, but [...] 2 ̆ 2 I have written several casebooks in two {{different}} areas of law and for two different publishers. I have also written another law school book for a third publisher. Along the way, I have learned a thing or two. If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> thinking <b>seriously</b> about writing a casebook, you might find these tips useful.
