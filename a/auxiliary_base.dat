5000|$|In fact, Bourbaki {{stipulates}} {{two additional}} features. First, several sets X1, ..., Xn (so-called principal base sets) may be used, {{rather than a}} single set X. However, this feature is of little use. All the items listed above use a single principal base set. Second, so-called <b>auxiliary</b> <b>base</b> sets E1, ..., Em may be used. This feature is widely used. Indeed, {{the structure of a}} vector space stipulates not only addition X × X → X but also scalar multiplication R × X → X (if R is the field of scalars). Thus, R is an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>base</b> set (called also [...] "external"). The scale of sets consists of all sets arising from all base sets (both principal and auxiliary) by taking Cartesian products and power sets. Still, the map f (possibly an isomorphism) acts on X only; auxiliary sets are endowed by identity maps. (However, the case of n principal sets leads to n maps.) ...|$|E

50|$|During World War II {{the island}} was {{strongly}} garrisoned by both the Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy. The headquarters of the IJA 91st Infantry Division, responsible for defense of the northern Kurils, was established at Kashiwabara, and numerous coastal artillery positions and fortified bunkers were constructed in various locations around the island. In addition, the Imperial Japanese Army constructed four airfields: Kashiwabara Airfield in the northeast with Ki-43 Oscars, Kakumabestu Airfield on the southwest coast with a 3800 ft runway and Ki-44 Tojos, Kitanodai Airfield on the northeast coast with a 4000 ft runway, and Suribachi Airfield, an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>base</b> {{in the center of}} the south coast with two runways. The Imperial Japanese Navy had Musashi Airfield on the south-western tip of the island with two 4000 ft runways, one 4,300 ft and another 4,200 ft, operating a variety of aircraft as well as a radar site.

NAS Pensacola expanded again, training 1,100 cadets a month, 11 times the number trained annually in the 1920s. The growth of NAS Pensacola from 10 tents to the world's greatest naval aviation center was emphasized by then-Senator Owen Brewster's statement: [...] "The growth of naval aviation during World War II {{is one of the}} wonders of the modern world." [...] Naval aviators from NAS Pensacola were called upon to train the Doolittle Raiders at Eglin Field in 1942 for carrier take-offs in their B-25 Mitchell bombers. Navy LT Henry Miller supervised their takeoff training and accompanied the crews to the launch. For his efforts, LT Miller is considered an honorary member of the Raider group.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of {{esterification}} with acetic anhydrides the currently accepted mechanism involves three steps. First, DMAP and acetic anhydride react in a pre-equilibrium reaction to form an ion pair of acetate and the acetylpyridinium ion. In the second step the alcohol adds to the acetylpyridinium, and elimination of pyridine forms an ester. Here the acetate acts as a base to remove the proton from the alcohol as it nucleophilically adds to the activated acylpyridinium. The bond from the acetyl group to the catalyst gets cleaved to generate the catalyst and the ester. The described bond formation and breaking process runs synchronous concerted without {{the appearance of a}} tetrahedral intermediate. The acetic acid formed will then protonate the DMAP. In the last step of the catalytic cycle the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>base</b> (usually triethylamine or pyridine) deprotonates the protonated DMAP, reforming the catalyst. The reaction runs through the described nucleophilic reaction pathway irrespective of the anhydride used, but the mechanism changes with the pKa value of the alcohol used. For example, the reaction runs through a base-catalyzed reaction pathway in {{the case of}} a phenol. In this case, DMAP acts as a base and deprotonates the phenol, and the resulting phenolate ion adds to the anhydride.|$|E

40|$|A {{grammatical}} Warlpiri sentence {{consists of}} a sequence of finite clauses. Relative and temporal finite clauses are syntactically “adjoined ” rather than embedded, and in fact {{it can be argued}} that there are no syntactically (only semantically) dependent finite clauses — all finite clauses are syntactically ”main ” clauses. Main clauses are either verbal, or non-‐verbal. Verbal finite clauses must contain a single Auxiliary, described below. Non-‐verbal clauses may optionally contain the pronominal clitics which make up the final part of the Auxiliary, but cannot contain an <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>base.</b> Thus, a single Auxiliary and a single finite verb are the only obligatory words of a finite verbal clause. As usual with spontaneous speech, the Warlpiri utterances under study do not always strictly conform to our notion of a complete grammatical sentence of Warlpiri. Sometimes apparently extraneous elements are present, sometimes essential elements are missing. These complications have to be addressed as we proceed with the analysis of the narrative into the clausal units.

40|$|Elucidating {{the genetic}} basis of complex traits and {{diseases}} in non-European populations is particularly challenging because US minority populations have been under-represented in genetic association studies. We developed an empirical Bayes approach named XPEB (cross-population empirical Bayes), {{designed to improve}} the power for mapping complex-trait-associated loci in a minority population by exploiting information from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) from another ethnic population. Taking as input summary statistics from two GWASs—a target GWAS from an ethnic minority population of primary interest and an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>base</b> GWAS (such as a larger GWAS in Europeans) —our XPEB approach reprioritizes SNPs in the target population to compute local false-discovery rates. We demonstrated, through simulations, that whenever the base GWAS harbors relevant information, XPEB gains efficiency. Moreover, XPEB {{has the ability to}} discard irrelevant auxiliary information, providing a safeguard against inflated false-discovery rates due to genetic heterogeneity between populations. Applied to a blood-lipids study in African Americans, XPEB more than quadrupled the discoveries from the conventional approach, which used a target GWAS alone, bringing the number of significant loci from 14 to 65. Thus, XPEB offers a flexible framework for mapping complex traits in minority populations...|$|E
40|$|Several dipeptides with an N-benzyloxycarbonyl or an N-(tert-butyloxycarbonyl) α-aminoisobutyric acid residue and a β-hydroxyamino acid {{methyl ester}} were {{subjected}} to dehydration to form dehydrodipeptide derivatives. N-Ethylation of these dipeptides using triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate with potassium tert-butoxide as <b>auxiliary</b> <b>base</b> led to complex mixtures that failed to render pure products. However, when the 4 -nitrophenylsulfonyl protecting group was substituted for the benzyloxycarbonyl or tert-butyloxycarbonyl groups and N,N-diisopropylethylamine was substituted for potassium tert-butoxide, the dehydrodipeptide derivatives were selectively N-alkylated at the amino terminal nitrogen in fair to high yields. Alternatively, N-ethylation {{can be carried out}} prior to dehydration. Thus, through a combination of dehydration and N-ethylation procedures, it was possible to obtain dipeptides with α-aminoisobutyric acid and dehydroamino acid residues, which are N-alkylated at the amino terminal nitrogen.
