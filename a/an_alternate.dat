5|$|Iginla {{participated in}} his second Olympics and was <b>an</b> <b>alternate</b> captain at the 2006 Turin games, {{recording}} three points in six games. The Canadians were unable to defend their 2002 gold medal, losing to Russia in the quarter-finals. Named <b>an</b> <b>alternate</b> captain once again for the 2010 team in Vancouver, he opened the tournament with a hat trick against Norway. He finished as the tournament leader with five goals, and assisted on Sidney Crosby's overtime winning goal in the gold medal final against the United States.|$|E

5000|$|A {{link with}} <b>an</b> <b>alternating</b> diagram, i.e. <b>an</b> <b>alternating</b> link, will be non-split if {{and only if}} this diagram is connected. This {{is a result of the}} work of William Menasco. [...] A split link has many connected, non-alternating link diagrams.|$|R

2500|$|As [...] showed, <b>an</b> <b>alternating</b> path or {{cycle in}} an un{{directed}} graph may be modeled {{as a regular}} path or cycle in a skew-symmetric directed graph. To create a skew-symmetric graph from an undirected graph G with a specified matching M, view G as a switch graph in which the edges at each vertex are partitioned into matched and unmatched edges; <b>an</b> <b>alternating</b> path in G is then a regular path in this switch graph and <b>an</b> <b>alternating</b> cycle in G is a regular cycle in the switch graph.|$|R
