At {{this point in}} the game, the letter from Mary is shown to have been a blank piece of paper the entire time. In another room, a final meeting with Angela sees her giving up on life as she is unable to cope with her trauma <b>and</b> <b>guilt</b> any longer. She walks into a fire and is not seen again.

5|$|Expanding on the {{aggressive}} {{sound of the}} band's previous work, Congregation has more refined musical details and slower songs such as ballads. Its music also incorporates R, soul, and funk influences. The album's cover depicts a nude black woman holding a white {{baby in her arms}} and alludes comically to the band's African-American music influences. The songs have themes of pleasure <b>and</b> <b>guilt,</b> and deal with topics such as dysfunctional relationships and sexual deviancy. Conceived during the burgeoning grunge scene, the album has been viewed by music writers as stylistically distinct from other Sub Pop and grunge music.|$|E
5|$|It {{rejects the}} Christian {{emphasis}} on sin <b>and</b> <b>guilt,</b> believing that these generate fear and thus negativity, which then hinder spiritual evolution. It also typically criticises the blaming and judging of others for their actions, believing {{that if an}} individual adopts these negative attitudes it harms their own spiritual evolution. Instead the movement emphasizes positive thinking, although beliefs regarding the power behind such thoughts vary within New Age literature. Common New Age examples of how to generate such positive thinking include the repeated recitation of mantras and statements carrying positive messages, and the visualisation of a white light.|$|E
50|$|A measure {{called the}} Interpersonal Guilt Questionnaire (IGQ) has been {{developed}} to assess patients' types <b>and</b> levels of <b>guilt,</b> <b>and</b> how they relate to each other.

40|$|Guilt appeals {{are used}} to try to {{influence}} consumer behavior, with literature defining three kinds – existential, anticipatory, <b>and</b> reactive <b>guilt.</b> Anticipatory <b>and</b> reactive <b>guilt</b> appeals have never been individually studied. The {{purpose of this study is}} hence to explain the relationship between anticipatory <b>guilt</b> <b>and</b> reactive <b>guilt,</b> respectively, inferences of manipulative intent, and consumers’ attitude toward a brand. To test this, an online questionnaire was used, followed by linear regression and moderation analyses. The results show a positive relationship between both anticipatory <b>guilt</b> <b>and</b> attitude <b>and</b> between reactive <b>guilt</b> <b>and</b> attitude. Inferences of manipulative intent do not moderate either relationship. Keywords Guilt appeal, anticipatory guilt, reactive guilt, inferences of manipulative intent, consumer brand attitude...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: : Attitudes toward <b>guilt</b> <b>and</b> {{forgiveness}} may {{be important}} factors determining distress in cancer patients. Direct comparative studies in patients with different life expectancies exploring attitudes toward <b>guilt</b> <b>and</b> forgiveness are lacking. Also, sociodemographic and religious characteristics determining the attitudes toward <b>guilt</b> <b>and</b> forgiveness are unknown. OBJECTIVE: : The objective {{of this study was}} to compare attitudes toward <b>guilt</b> <b>and</b> forgiveness in cancer patients without evidence of disease and advanced cancer patients. METHODS: : A descriptive research design was used. Ninety-seven patients without evidence of disease and 55 advanced cancer patients filled out the Dutch <b>Guilt</b> Measurement Instrument <b>and</b> the Forgiveness of Others Scale. RESULTS: : Both groups had an attitude of nonreligious <b>guilt</b> <b>and</b> forgiveness, but not of religious guilt. No significant differences in attitudes toward <b>guilt</b> <b>and</b> forgiveness were observed between the 2 groups. In contrast to sociodemographic characteristics, religious characteristics were relevant predictors for <b>guilt</b> <b>and</b> forgiveness. Significant differences in relations between images of God <b>and</b> attitudes toward <b>guilt</b> were observed between the 2 patient groups. CONCLUSIONS: : An attitude of nonreligious <b>guilt</b> <b>and</b> forgiveness was found in cancer patients, irrespective of the stage of disease. Religious characteristics were significantly associated with attitudes of <b>guilt</b> <b>and</b> forgiveness. This correlation differed in the early and the advanced setting of disease. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: : The observed relations between religious characteristics <b>and</b> attitudes of <b>guilt</b> <b>and</b> forgiveness suggest that a careful examination of the role of religious beliefs and values is relevant in the clinical care of patients with cancer, both in the setting of early and advanced disease...|$|R

5|$|Henry (Brandon Scott) and Sam (Nadji Jeter) are two {{brothers}} that Ellie and Joel encounter {{while trying to}} escape {{from a group of}} hunters in Pittsburgh. Henry is 25 years old, while Sam is thirteen. Joel and Henry initially think each other are hostile, until they see Sam and Ellie, respectively. Like Joel, Henry is an experienced survivor, and the two decide to team up, since both pairs are looking for the Fireflies. They work together to overpower the bandits guarding the exit to the Quarantine Zone, and escape to an abandoned radio tower in the Suburbs. There, Joel and Henry bond over their mutual love of motorbikes, but Sam becomes morose and introverted, particularly after a conversation with Ellie over death and the Infected. The next day, it emerges that Sam was bitten while escaping the Suburbs, and he attacks Ellie, forcing Henry to kill him. Overcome with grief <b>and</b> <b>guilt</b> at his brother's death, Henry commits suicide with his gun.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, Tracy joined Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, at {{the time}} Hollywood's most prestigious studio. His career flourished {{with a series of}} hit films, and in 1937 and 1938 he won {{consecutive}} Oscars for Captains Courageous and Boys Town. By the 1940s, Tracy was one of the studio's top stars. In 1942, he appeared with Katharine Hepburn in Woman of the Year, beginning a popular partnership that produced nine movies over 25 years. Tracy left MGM in 1955, and continued to work regularly as a freelance star, despite an increasing weariness as he aged. His personal life was troubled, with a lifelong struggle against alcoholism <b>and</b> <b>guilt</b> over his son's deafness. Tracy became estranged from his wife in the 1930s, but never divorced, conducting a long-term relationship with Katharine Hepburn in private. Towards the end of his life, Tracy worked almost exclusively for director Stanley Kramer. It was for Kramer that he made his last film, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner in 1967, completed just 17 days before Tracy's death.|$|E
5|$|Triptych, May–June 1973 is a {{triptych}} {{completed in}} 1973 by the Irish-born artist Francis Bacon (1909–1992). The oil-on-canvas was painted {{in memory of}} Bacon's lover George Dyer, who committed suicide {{on the eve of}} the artist's retrospective at Paris's Grand Palais on 24 October 1971. The triptych is a portrait of the moments before Dyer's death from an overdose of pills in their hotel room. Bacon was haunted and preoccupied by Dyer's loss for the remaining years of his life and painted many works based on both the actual suicide and the events of its aftermath. He admitted to friends that he never fully recovered, describing the 1973 triptych as an exorcism of his feelings of loss <b>and</b> <b>guilt.</b>|$|E
5|$|The trio battle Lynx for the Frozen Flame, and Lynx gains {{the upper}} hand after {{trapping}} Magil with a powerful spell. He plans to acquire Kid's special gift from Lucca—a Time Egg, or Chrono Trigger. With a Time Egg and the Frozen Flame, Lynx boasts that he shall achieve control over time. Kid lunges at him, but Lynx easily parries her attack and wounds her. She desperately removes the Chrono Trigger from her back pocket. The Trigger shatters and causes a localized temporal distortion, leading Serge to see various scenes in history. Kid learns of her heritage as princess Schala of Zeal, a meek girl who was coerced to help awaken Lavos with her magical power. As Zeal collapsed, Schala was wracked with anguish <b>and</b> <b>guilt</b> {{for her role in}} the incident. Nearby in the Ocean Palace, the Frozen Flame felt her grief and changed her to a baby, sending her to the modern era where Lucca found her. It is also circumstantially revealed that Magil is in fact Magus, Schala's wayward brother who searched for her after battling Lavos in Chrono Trigger. Once the distortion subsides, an army from Porre—a large nation in search of the Frozen Flame—storms the mansion. Lynx withdraws as Kid, Serge, and Magil flee. Kid tells Serge that she is aware of her true origin, and knowing that is a treasure which cannot be stolen. She bids him goodbye before disappearing into the darkness with Magil.|$|E

25|$|While the {{intensity}} of the emotion does not seem to influence whether an emotional event is shared or kept secret, the type of emotion involved does appear to play a role. Specifically, emotional experiences involving feelings of shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt</b> tend to be shared less frequently, less often, and with fewer people. While sharing of emotional events involves self-disclosure, feelings of shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt</b> are associated with concealment of the self.|$|E

25|$|Impulsive {{behavior}} is common, including substance or alcohol abuse, eating disorders, unprotected sex or indiscriminate sex with multiple partners, reckless spending, and reckless driving. Impulsive behavior may also include leaving jobs or relationships, running away, and self-injury. People with BPD act impulsively {{because it gives}} them the feeling of immediate relief from their emotional pain. However, in the long term, people with BPD suffer increased pain from the shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt</b> that follow such actions. A cycle often begins in which people with BPD feel emotional pain, engage in impulsive behavior to relieve that pain, feel shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt</b> over their actions, feel emotional pain from the shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt,</b> and then experience stronger urges to engage in impulsive behavior to relieve the new pain. As time goes on, impulsive behavior may become an automatic response to emotional pain.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the psychometric}} {{properties}} of the scenario?based Achievement <b>Guilt</b> <b>and</b> Shame Scale (AGSS) were established. The AGSS and scales assessing interpersonal <b>guilt</b> <b>and</b> shame, high standards, overgeneralization, self-criticism, self-esteem, academic self-concept, fear of failure, and tendency to respond in a socially desirable manner were completed by 322 undergraduate students. A confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a 12 -scenario model had an acceptable fit to the data, with <b>guilt</b> <b>and</b> shame items forming separate, weakly correlated subscales. Each of the <b>guilt</b> <b>and</b> shame subscales of the AGSS demonstrated good internal and test-retest reliability. Good construct validity was also evident, with each subscale uniquely correlating with constructs in ways that were consistent with predictions. Acceptable discriminant validity was also evident. These outcomes provide support for the utility of the AGSS in assessing <b>guilt</b> <b>and</b> shame reactions in achievement situations...|$|R
