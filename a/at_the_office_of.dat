5|$|In January 1942, {{the couple}} moved to Washington, D.C., where Nixon {{took a job}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> Price Administration. In his {{political}} campaigns, Nixon would suggest that this was his response to Pearl Harbor, but he had sought the position throughout {{the latter part of}} 1941. Both Nixon and his wife believed he was limiting his prospects by remaining in Whittier. He was assigned to the tire rationing division, where he was tasked with replying to correspondence. He did not enjoy the role, and four months later, applied to join the United States Navy. As a birthright Quaker, he could have claimed exemption from the draft; he might also have been deferred because he worked in government service. But instead of exploiting his circumstance, Nixon sought a commission in the navy. His application was successful, and he was appointed a lieutenant junior grade in the U.S Naval Reserve (U.S. Navy Reserve) on June 15, 1942.|$|E

Baker approved the creation of this formation, which became the 42nd ("Rainbow") Division, and appointed Major General William A. Mann, the head of the National Guard Bureau, as its commander; MacArthur was its chief of staff, with the rank of colonel.
