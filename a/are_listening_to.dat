The cover artwork was {{designed}} by Ray Lowry and is identical to the Columbia sleeve with the exception of changing the blank 78 covers that the young teenage cover models <b>are</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> classic Rock and Punk LP sleeves. From left to right they are, The Beatles' debut Please Please Me, Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols, The Rolling Stones debut, The Clash debut, Bob Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited and finally the Elvis Presley debut LP.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the great}} variety of {{different}} speakers and different conditions, listeners perceive vowels and consonants as constant categories. It has been proposed that this is achieved {{by means of the}} perceptual normalization process in which listeners filter out the noise (i.e. variation) to arrive at the underlying category. Vocal-tract-size differences result in formant-frequency variation across speakers; therefore a listener has to adjust his/her perceptual system to the acoustic characteristics of a particular speaker. This may be accomplished by considering the ratios of formants rather than their absolute values. This process has been called vocal tract normalization (see Figure 3 for an example). Similarly, listeners are believed to adjust the perception of duration to the current tempo of the speech they <b>are</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> – this has been referred to as speech rate normalization.|$|E

According to Sean Daly of the St. Petersburg Times: [...] "YouTube now has vids of babies and girlfriends doing this Jai Ho dance. There are remixes and tributes, too".|$|E

500|$|In 2011, John Calvert {{stated that}} [...] "timing" [...] {{is the reason}} why a grunge revival did not happen; he says that the {{cultural}} mood of the late 1980s and early 1990s, which inspired the movement, were no longer present. Seattle songwriter Jeff Stetson states that people from the 2010s who <b>are</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> grunge should learn about the [...] "...context and history of how it all came to be" [...] and [...] "...respect for what a truly amazing thing it was that happened here [...] because you probably won't see anything like it again." [...] Paste magazine's Michael Danaher states that the grunge [...] "...movement changed the course of rock ’n’ roll, bringing... tales of abuse and depression" [...] and socially conscious issues" [...] into pop culture.|$|E
500|$|She {{described}} the music as [...] "dirty south hip-hop" [...] and combining the genres of hip-hop and country, which she felt was a [...] "good hybrid". To achieve this sound, Cyrus worked with various hip hop producers including Mike Will Made It, Mac Miller, Pharrell Williams, and Tyler, the Creator in cities including Atlanta, Georgia. They {{helped her to}} incorporate hip hop music elements into the project, which Cyrus acknowledged resulted in a [...] "really different sound". Cyrus further commented that her project would [...] "shut everyone up", and later compared the record to Bad (1987) by Michael Jackson, in that [...] "people still <b>are</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> [...] because it's so fucking dope" [...] and [...] " [...] people to listen to [...] album like that." [...] She also expressed her desire to [...] "set a new standard for pop music". Producer Sean Garrett called the record [...] "fun [...] exciting", and stated that a collaboration that Cyrus recorded with Britney Spears would appear on the final track listing. Mike Will Made It explained that the title for the album was decided upon after realizing that [...] "whole album was bangers".|$|E
500|$|Following in suit of its lukewarm {{critical}} response, [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)" [...] {{has made}} little impact since its release. The song made its chart debut on the US Billboard Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart on August 9, 2012, at number 97. It debuted on the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart {{for the issue}} dated August 25, 2012, at number 15, representing the 25 songs charting under the Billboard Hot 100. During the week dated August 11, 2012, the single debuted at number three on the South Korea Gaon International Chart, with 35,870 digital download sales. [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)" [...] entered the UK Singles Chart issue dated at number 144 on August 15, 2012, and at number 29 on the UK R Chart. Similarly, it charted at number 135 during its debut week on the French Singles Chart. In Spain, the song debuted at number 36 on August 12, 2012. Critics have attributed the song's initial weak charting to its urban sound, describing it as having little Mainstream Top 40 or crossover appeal. According to The Huffington Post, due to radio's bias against artists over age 40, [...] "It’s not like people <b>are</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the song and deciding they don’t like it; [...] they are not even listening.

500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, Adam Mazmanian from Library Journal recommended Spin Alternative Record Guide to [...] "both public and academic libraries" [...] {{and said that}} while The Rolling Stone Album Guide (1992) also offers complete discographies of artists ranging from Jonathan Richman to Throbbing Gristle, this book's reviews are superior in [...] "length and scope". Mazmanian argued that [...] "this guide fills {{a gap in the}} literature of modern music" [...] at a time when [...] "alternative" [...] has developed a ubiquitous presence in the marketing of popular music. In New York magazine, Kim France called it [...] "a well-edited, unpretentious, and comprehensive look at all the crazy stuff the kids <b>are</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> these days". In a less enthusiastic review, Booklist critic Gordon Flagg was impressed by the accuracy of the artist entries {{and the quality of the}} contributors' reviews, but found Weisbard's idea of alternative ill-defined and recommended The Trouser Press Record Guide (1991) as a more comprehensive alternative. Billboard magazine's Beth Renaud was more critical of the book, calling much of the writing biased and the organization unencyclopedic. She said Weisbard's [...] "obligatory" [...] essay is outdated and vague in defining alternative rock and that the contributors [...] "gush" [...] over artists usually covered by Spin, with many relevant artists omitted in place of more perplexing additions.|$|E
500|$|On June 5, 2017, Dylan's Nobel Lecture {{was posted}} on the Nobel prize website. The New York Times pointed out that, in order to collect the prize’s 8 million Swedish krona ($900,000), the Swedish Academy’s rules {{stipulate}} the laureate [...] "must deliver a lecture within {{six months of the}} official ceremony, which would have made Mr. Dylan’s deadline June 10." [...] Academy secretary Danius commented: [...] "The speech is extraordinary and, as one might expect, eloquent. Now that the lecture has been delivered, the Dylan adventure is coming to a close." [...] In his essay, Dylan writes about the impact that three important books made on him: Herman Melville's Moby Dick, Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front and Homer's The Odyssey. He concludes: [...] "Our songs are alive {{in the land of the}} living. But songs are unlike literature. They’re meant to be sung, not read. The words in Shakespeare’s plays were meant to be acted on the stage. Just as lyrics in songs are meant to be sung, not read on a page. And I hope some of you get the chance to listen to these lyrics the way they were intended to be heard: in concert or on record or however people <b>are</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> songs these days. I return once again to Homer, who says, 'Sing in me, oh Muse, and through me tell the story'." [...] Alan Pasqua provided the uncredited piano accompaniment for the recorded speech.|$|E
