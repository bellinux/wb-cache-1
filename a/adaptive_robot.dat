40|$|Abstract-Automatically {{detecting}} {{different styles}} of play in human-robot interaction is a key challenge towards <b>adaptive</b> <b>robots,</b> i. e. robots {{that are able to}} regulate the interactions and adapt to different interaction styles of the robot users. In this paper we present a novel algorithm for pattern recognition in human-robot interaction, the Cascaded Information Bottleneck Method. We apply it to real-time autonomous recognition of human-robot interaction styles. This method uses an information theoretic approach and enables to progressively extract relevant information from time series. It relies on a cascade of bottlenecks, the bottlenecks being trained one after the other according to the existing Agglomerative Information Bottleneck Algorithm. We show that a structure for the bottleneck states along the cascade emerges and we introduce a measure to extrapolate unseen data. We apply this method to real-time recognition of Human-Robot Interaction Styles by a robot in a detailed case study. The algorithm has been implemented for real interactions between humans and a real robot. We demonstrate that the algorithm, which is designed to operate real time, is capable of classifying interaction styles, with a good accuracy and a very acceptable delay. Our future work will evaluate this method in scenarios on robot-assisted therapy for children with autism.

40|$|Recently, the Modbus RTU {{protocol}} {{has been}} widely accepted {{in the application of}} robotics, communications and industrial control systems due to its simplicity and reliability. With the help of the MATLAB Instrument Control Toolbox, a serial communication between Simulink and a 3 Finger <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Robot</b> Gripper can be realized to demonstrate a grasping functionality. The toolbox includes a “to instrument” and “query instrument” programming blocks that enable the users to create a serial communication with the targeted hardware/robot.

40|$|The {{generation}} of adaptive and reflexive behavior is a challenging task in artificial intelligence and robotics. In this thesis, we develop {{a framework for}} knowledge representation, acquisition, and behavior generation that explicitly incorporates semantics, adaptive reasoning and knowledge revision. By using our model, semantic information can be exploited by traditional planning and decision making frameworks to generate empirically effective and <b>adaptive</b> <b>robot</b> behaviors, {{as well as to}} enable complex but natural human-robot interactions. In our work, we introduce a model of semantic mapping, we connect it with the notion of affordances, and we use those concepts to develop semantic-driven algorithms for knowledge acquisition, update, learning and robot behavior generation. In particular, we apply such models within existing planning and decision making frameworks to achieve semantic-driven and <b>adaptive</b> <b>robot</b> behaviors in a generic environment. On the one hand, this work generalizes existing semantic mapping models and extends them to include the notion of affordances. On the other hand, this work integrates semantic information within well-defined long-term planning and situated action frameworks to effectively generate <b>adaptive</b> <b>robot</b> behaviors. We validate our approach by evaluating it on a number of problems and robot tasks.

40|$|System {{adaptability}} is {{very important}} to current manufacturing practices due to frequent changes in the customer needs. Two basic concepts that can be employed to achieve system adaptability are flexible systems and modular systems. Flexible systems are fixed integral systems with some adjustable components. Adjustable components have limited ranges of parameter changes that can be made, thus restricting the adaptability of systems. Modular systems are composed of a set of pre-existing modules. Usually, the parameters of modules in modular systems are fixed, and thus increased system adaptability is realized only by increasing the number of modules. Increasing the number of modules could result in higher costs, poor positioning accuracy, and low system stiffness in the context of manufacturing applications. In this thesis, a new idea was formulated: a combination of the flexible system and modular system concepts. Systems developed based on this new idea are called adaptive systems. This thesis is focused on <b>adaptive</b> <b>robot</b> systems. An <b>adaptive</b> <b>robot</b> system is such that adaptive components or adjustable parameters are introduced upon the modular architecture of a robot system. This implies that there are two levels to achieve system adaptability: the level where a set of modules is appropriately assembled and the level where adjustable components or parameters are specified. Four main contributions were developed in this thesis study. First, a General Architecture of Modular Robots (GAMR) was developed. The starting point was to define the architecture of <b>adaptive</b> <b>robot</b> systems to have as many configuration variations as possible. A novel application of the Axiomatic Design Theory (ADT) was applied to GAMR development. It was found that GAMR was the one with the most coverage, and with a judicious definition of adjustable parameters. Second, a system called Automatic Kinematic and Dynamic Analysis (AKDA) was developed. This system was a foundation for synthesis of <b>adaptive</b> <b>robot</b> configurations. In comparison with the existing approach, the proposed approach has achieved systemization, generality, flexibility, and completeness. Third, this thesis research has developed a finding that in modular system design, simultaneous consideration of both kinematic and dynamic behaviors is a necessary step, owing to a strong coupling between design variables and system behaviors. Based on this finding, a method for simultaneous consideration of type synthesis, number synthesis, and dimension synthesis was developed. Fourth, an adaptive modular Parallel Kinematic Machine (PKM) was developed to demonstrate the benefits of <b>adaptive</b> <b>robot</b> systems in parallel kinematic machines, which have found many applications in machine tool industries. In this architecture, actuators and limbs were modularized, while the platforms were adjustable {{in such a way that}} both the joint positions and orientations on the platforms can be changed...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} of this work was to examine human response to motion-level robot adaptation to determine its effect on team fluency, human satisfaction, and perceived safety and comfort. Background: The evaluation of human response to adaptive robotic assistants has been limited, particularly {{in the realm of}} motion-level adaptation. The lack of true human-in-the-loop evaluation has made it impossible to determine whether such adaptation would lead to efficient and satisfying human–robot interaction. Method: We conducted an experiment in which participants worked with a robot to perform a collaborative task. Participants worked with an <b>adaptive</b> <b>robot</b> incorporating human-aware motion planning and with a baseline robot using shortest-path motions. Team fluency was evaluated through a set of quantitative metrics, and human satisfaction and perceived safety and comfort were evaluated through questionnaires. Results: When working with the <b>adaptive</b> <b>robot,</b> participants completed the task 5. 57 % faster, with 19. 9 % more concurrent motion, 2. 96 % less human idle time, 17. 3 % less robot idle time, and a 15. 1 % greater separation distance. Questionnaire responses indicated that participants felt safer and more comfortable when working with an <b>adaptive</b> <b>robot</b> and were more satisfied with it as a teammate than with the standard robot. Conclusion: People respond well to motion-level robot adaptation, and significant benefits can be achieved from its use in terms of both human–robot team fluency and human worker satisfaction.

40|$|Abstract Background Recovery {{of upper}} {{extremity}} function is particularly recalcitrant to successful rehabilitation. Robotic-assisted arm training devices integrated with virtual targets or complex virtual reality gaming simulations {{are being developed}} {{to deal with this}} problem. Neural control mechanisms indicate that reaching and hand-object manipulation are interdependent, suggesting that training on tasks requiring coordinated effort of both the upper arm and hand may be a more effective method for improving recovery of real world function. However, most robotic therapies have focused on training the proximal, rather than distal effectors of the upper extremity. This paper describes the effects of robotically-assisted, integrated upper extremity training. Methods Twelve subjects post-stroke were trained for eight days on four upper extremity gaming simulations using <b>adaptive</b> <b>robots</b> during 2 - 3 hour sessions. Results The subjects demonstrated improved proximal stability, smoothness and efficiency of the movement path. This was in concert with improvement in the distal kinematic measures of finger individuation and improved speed. Importantly, these changes were accompanied by a robust 16 -second decrease in overall time in the Wolf Motor Function Test and a 24 -second decrease in the Jebsen Test of Hand Function. Conclusions Complex gaming simulations interfaced with <b>adaptive</b> <b>robots</b> requiring integrated control of shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist and finger movements appear to have a substantial effect on improving hemiparetic hand function. We believe that the magnitude of the changes and the stability of the patient's function prior to training, along with maintenance of several aspects of the gains demonstrated at retention make a compelling argument for this approach to training. </p...|$|R

40|$|Human-robot {{interaction}} {{could be}} improved by designing robots that engage in adaptive dialogue with users. An <b>adaptive</b> <b>robot</b> could estimate the information needs of individuals and change its dialogue to suit these needs. We test the value of <b>adaptive</b> <b>robot</b> dialogue by experimentally comparing the effects of adaptation versus no adaptation on information exchange and social relations. In Experiment 1, a robot chef adapted to novices by providing detailed explanations of cooking tools; doing so improved information exchange for novice participants but did not influence experts.

When the robot’s dialogue was adapted for expert knowledge (names of tools rather than explanations), expert participants found the robot to be more effective, more authoritative, and less patronizing.

We describe the evolution {{and implementation of the}} autonomous robot ARBIB, which learns from and adapts to its environment. A primary goal was to test the notion that effective robot learning can be based on neural habituation and sensitization, so validating the suggestion of Hawkins and Kandel that (associative) classical and `higher order'conditioning might be based on an elaboration of these (non-associative) forms of learning. Accordingly, ARBIB's `nervous system' has a non-homogeneous population of spiking neurons, and learning is by modification of basic, pre-existing (`hard-wired') reflexes.
