5|$|Ring dunk: A non school sanctioned {{tradition}} performed after {{a student}} receives an Aggie Ring; usually involves chugging <b>a</b> <b>pitcher</b> <b>of</b> beer, or a non-alcoholic substitute, with their Aggie Ring {{in the bottom}} then catching the ring in their teeth.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a brief {{sequence}} inside a dark room where water drips from an open window. Recreating {{a scene from the}} Andrei Tarkovsky film The Sacrifice, Buck, Berry, and Mills run across the room while Stipe remains seated as <b>a</b> <b>pitcher</b> <b>of</b> milk drops from the windowsill and shatters; the song then begins. Director Singh also drew inspiration from the Italian painter Caravaggio and the video is laden with religious imagery such as Saint Sebastian, the Biblical episode of the Incredulity of Thomas and Hindu deities, portrayed in a series of tableaux.|$|E
25|$|There is {{much about}} Manson's early {{life that is}} in dispute because of the varying stories he has offered to interviewers, {{many of which were}} untrue. Manson's mother was {{allegedly}} a heavy drinker. According to Manson, she once sold her son for <b>a</b> <b>pitcher</b> <b>of</b> beer to a childless waitress, from whom his uncle retrieved him some days later.|$|E

25|$|Each {{individual}} {{award is}} given only to one recipient. There is not <b>a</b> <b>Pitcher</b> <b>of</b> the Year in the Lewis Conference and the Clark Conference, for instance. The best in each conference {{never get a}} chance to face each other in the regular season, so they must put up statistics that speak for themselves. The only flaw in this model is the assumption that the talent in both conferences is nearly identical.|$|E
25|$|In {{her later}} years, Rickey fell {{on hard times}} with declining health and {{financial}} woes. She took a church mission trip to Mexico in 1996 and returned with a mysterious virus which ruined her health. Thereafter, {{she was diagnosed with}} Crohn's disease and hypertension. She was a former Presbyterian who had converted to Roman Catholicism. Unable to find steady employment and with high-deductible health insurance coverage, she had practically exhausted her life savings before being found dead with <b>a</b> <b>pitcher</b> <b>of</b> iced tea in her hand at the Silver Saddle Motel in Santa Fe, New Mexico. A friend had paid for a week of lodging for Rickey.|$|E
500|$|For decades, though unsanctioned and {{discouraged}} by the University, an unofficial tradition among willing students involves [...] "dunking" [...] the newly acquired Aggie Ring. The Ring is dropped in <b>a</b> <b>pitcher</b> <b>of</b> beer and the student chugs the entire pitcher and catches the Ring {{in his or her}} teeth. The Dixie Chicken, among other bars, {{has been one of the}} more popular venues for dunking Aggie Rings, though it no longer endorses the activity. Some students choose to dunk their Rings in alternative substances, including ice cream or nonalcoholic beverages.|$|E

500|$|The final day's {{proceedings}} {{were taken}} up by Davy, who produced more prosecution witnesses, and proceeded to pick apart the testimony of those {{who claimed to have}} seen Squires in Enfield Wash, in January. [...] He summarised the prosecution's case by telling the jury that Canning was guilty of [...] "the most impious and detestable [...] the human heart can conceive". [...] The recorder, William Moreton, stated the defence's case, and asked the jury to consider if they thought that Canning had answered the charges against her to their satisfaction, and if it was possible she could have survived for almost a month on [...] "no more than a quartern-loaf, and <b>a</b> <b>pitcher</b> <b>of</b> water".|$|E
500|$|The hearing {{took six}} days, {{finishing}} on 18 February 2008, with the judgment being made public on 17 March 2008. Mills was eventually awarded {{a lump sum}} of £16.5m, together with assets of £7.8m, which included the properties she owned at the time. The total was £24.3million (nearly $50 million in US currency,) plus payments of £35,000 per annum, for a nanny and school costs for their daughter. In his judgment, Justice Bennett [...] stated: [...] "The husband's evidence was, in my judgment, balanced. He expressed himself moderately though at times with justifiable irritation, if not anger. He was consistent, accurate and honest. But I regret {{to have to say}} I cannot say the same about the wife's evidence. Having watched and listened to her give evidence, having studied the documents, and having given in her favour every allowance for the enormous strain she must have been under (and in conducting her own case) I am driven to the conclusion that much of her evidence, both written and oral, was not just inconsistent and inaccurate but also less than candid. Overall, she was a less than impressive witness." [...] Regarding her career, the judge said: [...] "I find that, far from the husband dictating to and restricting the wife's career and charitable activities, he did the exact opposite. He encouraged it and lent his support, name and reputation to her business and charitable activities. The facts as I find them do not in any way support her claim." [...] In anger at the judgment, Mills threw <b>a</b> <b>pitcher</b> <b>of</b> water on the head of Fiona Shackleton, McCartney's solicitor, in the courtroom.|$|E

2500|$|Because {{a pitcher}} is {{generally}} considered wild if he averages four walks per nine innings, <b>a</b> <b>pitcher</b> <b>of</b> average repertoire who consistently walked as many as nine men per nine innings would not normally be considered a prospect.

2500|$|There {{was also}} {{political}} opposition. Sociobiology re-ignited {{the nature and}} nurture debate. Wilson was accused of racism, misogyny, and sympathy to eugenics. In one incident in November 1978, his lecture was attacked by the International Committee Against Racism, a front group of the Marxist Progressive Labor Party, where one member poured <b>a</b> <b>pitcher</b> <b>of</b> water on Wilson's head and chanted [...] "Wilson, you're all wet" [...] at an AAAS conference. Wilson later spoke of the incident {{as a source of}} pride: [...] "I believe...I was the only scientist in modern times to be physically attacked for an idea." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{some sources}} say he {{graduated}} from Harvard College in 1751, {{it is far more}} likely that this was his 21-year-old son, Joseph, Jr., rather than the 46-year-old Wanton, who was by then a highly successful merchant sailing the globe in pursuit of commercial interests. [...] That he was well educated, however, is certain from the vast amount of correspondence in which he engaged, particularly as governor of the colony. [...] In the mid-1750s, the Boston portraitist, John Greenwood, followed a group of sea captains and merchants to Surinam on the northeast coast of South America. [...] The trading usually took time, so the men often waited in pubs. [...] Being commissioned by the merchants to create a satirical painting, Greenwood concocted a 22-figure tavern scene, showing himself among the affluent traders, all subject to the [...] "intoxicating effects of alcohol and economic ambition." [...] Most accounts agree that Wanton is the bald man slumped in a chair by the table, being doused with <b>a</b> <b>pitcher</b> <b>of</b> rum, by one account, or of punch and vomit, by other accounts.|$|E
2500|$|Reimer entered {{office with}} an ambitious agenda, {{but she was}} unable to {{implement}} much of it due to a fractured city council. [...] Notoriously, alderman Sheila McKay dumped <b>a</b> <b>pitcher</b> <b>of</b> water over the head of alderman Brian Mason during one heated dispute; McKay later blamed her actions in part on Reimer's failure to censure Mason for telling her to [...] "shut up". [...] Faced with a divided and at times hostile city council, Reimer attempted to advance much of her agenda in the council's Executive Committee, but was criticized for this by alderman and former ally Patricia MacKenzie, who alleged that Reimer was attempting to disempower council. [...] Council further impeded her ability to implement her agenda by changing the rules such that the chairs standing committees were elected by standing committees rather than appointed by the mayor; Reimer considered using the mayor's ex-officio status as a member of every standing committee to show up and vote for her preferred candidate, but ultimately decided that [...] "it was best they try to sort it out among themselves." ...|$|E
