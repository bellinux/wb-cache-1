50|$|To use {{cellulose}} as an example, semicrystalline microfibrils are sheared in the <b>amorphous</b> <b>region,</b> {{resulting in}} microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). These small, crystalline cellulose fibrils {{are at this}} points reclassified as a whisker and can be 2 to 20nm in diameter with shapes ranging from spherical to cylindrical. Whiskers of collagen, chitin, and cellulose have all {{be used to make}} biological nanocomposites. The matrix of these composites are commonly hydrophobic synthetic polymers such as polyethylene, and polyvinyl chloride and copolymers of polystyrene and polyacrylate.|$|E
50|$|Cross-linking is the {{chemical}} process to produce textiles with wrinkle resistance. Wrinkle resistance {{is achieved by}} the crosslinking of cellulose chains to stop the molecules from moving when in contact with water or other environmental stress. Cotton cellulose polymer comprises three different regions: the crystalline region, the <b>amorphous</b> <b>region,</b> and an intermediate region between them. Although in the crystalline region the cellulose chains are closely arranged, limiting their mobility, chains in the amorphous and intermediate regions are bonded together by weaker bonds making them more susceptible to breaking. There {{are two types of}} crosslinkers, which are {{the chemical}}s that bond together cellulose chains, the fist ones only bond cellulose chains, while the second self-polymerize resins as well.|$|E
50|$|Semi-crystalline {{polymers}} {{are more}} complex than amorphous polymers, since the crystalline regions are interspersed with <b>amorphous</b> <b>regions.</b> <b>Amorphous</b> <b>regions</b> in close association to the crystals or contain common molecules as tie molecules have less degrees of freedom than the bulk amorphous phase. These immobilised <b>amorphous</b> <b>regions</b> are called the rigid amorphous phase. CTE of the rigid amorphous phase {{is expected to be}} lower than that of the bulk amorphous phase.|$|R
50|$|Below their melting temperatures, most {{thermoplastic}} polymers (polyethylene, nylon, etc.) have <b>amorphous</b> <b>regions</b> {{in which}} the chains approximate random coils, alternating with regions that are crystalline.

Decreasing sputtering power from 100 W to 50 W, decreasing sputtering time from 20 h to 5 h expanded <b>amorphous</b> <b>regions</b> and increasing substrate temperature from 90 °C to 250 °C reduced the <b>amorphous</b> <b>regions.</b> These results were compared with the {{variation of}} the critical cooling rate for glass formation from the melt of the system...|$|R
50|$|Electrical {{switching}} in chalcogenide semiconductors {{emerged in}} the 1960s, when the amorphous chalcogenide Te48As30Si12Ge10 was found to exhibit sharp, reversible transitions in electrical resistance above a threshold voltage. If current is allowed to persist in the non-crystalline material, it heats up and changes to crystalline form. This is equivalent to information being written on it. A crystalline region may be melted by exposure to a brief, intense pulse of heat. Subsequent rapid cooling then sends the melted region back through the glass transition. Conversely, a lower-intensity heat pulse of longer duration will crystallize an <b>amorphous</b> <b>region.</b> Attempts to induce the glassy-crystal transformation of chalcogenides by electrical means {{form the basis of}} phase-change random-access memory (PC-RAM). This technology has been developed to near commercial use by ECD Ovonics. For write operations, an electric current supplies the heat pulse. The read process is performed at sub-threshold voltages by utilizing the relatively large difference in electrical resistance between the glassy and crystalline states. Examples of such phase change materials are GeSbTe and AgInSbTe.|$|E
50|$|Another {{route to}} PLA is the direct {{condensation}} of lactic acid monomers. This process {{needs to be}} carried out at less than 200 °C; above that temperature, the entropically favored lactide monomer is generated. This reaction generates one equivalent of water for every condensation (esterification) step, and that is undesirable because water causes chain-transfer leading to low molecular weight material. The direct condensation is thus performed in a stepwise fashion, where lactic acid is first oligomerized to PLA oligomers. Thereafter, polycondensation is done in the melt or as a solution, where short oligomeric units are combined to give a high molecular weight polymer strand. Water removal by application of a vacuum or by azeotropic distillation is crucial to favor polycondensation over transesterification. Molecular weights of 130 kDa can be obtained this way. Even higher molecular weights can be attained by carefully crystallizing the crude polymer from the melt. Carboxylic acid and alcohol end groups are thus concentrated in the <b>amorphous</b> <b>region</b> of the solid polymer, and so they can react. Molecular weights of 128-152 kDa are obtainable thus.|$|E
30|$|The bulking effect {{prevents}} {{intrusion of}} water into the <b>amorphous</b> <b>region</b> by introducing the bulking agent into the region and swelling it. When the chemical substance is hydrophobic, solid, has high viscosity, or has high molecular weight, however, the substance itself may not easily impregnate into the <b>amorphous</b> <b>region.</b> In such cases, the chemicals are often dissolved in a solvent with a high ability to swell the <b>amorphous</b> <b>region.</b> The solvent is usually removed once the impregnation is completed. Both the solvent and the substance {{are present in the}} <b>amorphous</b> <b>region,</b> and thus after the solvent is removed, the region contains space that can absorb water. To treat wood completely with the chemical substance, this space has to be also filled with the substance. Therefore, we focused on the mechanism whereby a non-volatile substance diffuses into cell walls during the conditioning, or process of moderate drying of solvent, of wood impregnated with a solution of the substance, as suggested by Stamm [3].|$|E

30|$|The {{agreement}} between the calculation and experimental results shown in Fig.  6 implies that the <b>amorphous</b> <b>region</b> created through the NaOH treatment has a monotonically decreasing distribution from the surface to the center in the cc region, and that the <b>amorphous</b> <b>region</b> perfectly transverses the region at [NaOH] > 0.12 after increasing in [NaOH] (Fig.  5 a, b).

50|$|Crystalline {{polymers}} {{are usually}} opaque because of light scattering on the numerous boundaries between the crystalline and <b>amorphous</b> <b>regions.</b> The density of such boundaries is lower {{and thus the}} transparency is higher either for low (amorphous polymer) or high (crystalline) degree of crystallinity. For example, atactic polypropylene is usually amorphous and transparent while syndiotactic polypropylene, which has crystallinity ~50%, is opaque. Crystallinity also affects dyeing of polymers: crystalline polymers {{are more difficult to}} stain than amorphous ones because the dye molecules penetrate much easier through <b>amorphous</b> <b>regions.</b>|$|R

30|$|Among {{cellulose}} fibres, cotton {{is still}} the most popular fibre because of its several advantages. Since cotton readily absorbs moisture, it is susceptible towards shrinkage. The moisture is absorbed in the <b>amorphous</b> <b>region</b> of cotton, water molecules then act as lubricant and helps in movement of internal polymer chains. The movement of internal polymer chains are facilitated by disrupting the hydrogen bonding among polymer chains in <b>amorphous</b> <b>region.</b> In order to relieve stress in a stressed cellulose fibre, the internal polymer chains of the amorphous areas move freely. The new hydrogen bonds are then formed in the swollen state of cellulose in new configuration in the <b>amorphous</b> <b>region</b> and are locked after drying. Therefore the wrinkled appearance of the cellulose fabric persists even after drying, in contrast to non swelling synthetic fibres (Lam et al. 2011) and also the fabric shrinks (Schindler and Hauser 2004).|$|E

50|$|The thermal {{characteristics}} of polymers are {{fundamentally different from}} those of most solid materials. Solid materials typically have one melting point, the Tm, above which the material loses internal molecular ordering and becomes a liquid. Polymers have both a melting temperature Tm and a glass transition temperature Tg. Above the Tm, the polymer chains lose their molecular ordering and exhibit reptation, or mobility. Below the Tm, but still above the Tg, the polymer chains lose some of their long-range mobility and can form either crystalline or <b>amorphous</b> <b>regions.</b> In this temperature range, as the temperature decreases, <b>amorphous</b> <b>regions</b> can transition into crystalline regions, causing the bulk material to become more crystalline over all. Below the Tg, molecular motion is stopped and the polymer chains are essentially frozen in place. In this temperature range, <b>amorphous</b> <b>regions</b> can no longer transition into crystalline regions, and the polymer as a whole has reached its maximum crystallinity.|$|R

40|$|Novel aspects {{concerning}} the micromechanical response of <b>amorphous</b> <b>regions</b> confined by crystals in nano-sized domains are illustrated for semicrystalline poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), {{on the basis}} of microindentation hardness and dynamical mechanical spectroscopy (DMS) analyses (10 - 3 ÷ 60 Hz frequency range for DMS). PET samples were crystallized from the glassy state at low and high temperatures (Tc= 100 C and 160 C, respectively) and subsequently recrystallized some degrees above to gain information {{on the nature of the}} <b>amorphous</b> <b>regions.</b> DMS at 95 C reveals two segmental relaxation processes ascribed to the interlamellar <b>amorphous</b> <b>regions</b> (slow mode) and to the interstack amorphous pockets (APs) (fast mode) respectively, the latter being the object of the present study. It is shown that recrystallization changes the cooperativity within the APs. At low Tc, an increase in the cooperativity and the free energy barrier for readjustment is found after recrystallization. Room temperature indentation measurements reveal an enhancement of the average hardness value of the <b>amorphous</b> <b>regions,</b> Ha, on samples recrystallized a few degrees above Tc= 100 C. The reduced size of the APs regions upon recrystallization is discussed as a relevant parameter giving rise to an enhanced segmental confinement and a parallel hardening. Results for the high Tc material reveal that, in this case, both the cooperativity (measured at 95 °C) and Ha (measured at room temperature) decrease upon recrystallization. The influence of the coupling of the APs with the crystal walls, on the relaxation mode and in turn on the mechanical behavior of the material, is envisaged to be a possible mechanism underlying these observations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
