We investigate if these mechanisms are substitutes or complements by looking at equity prices from 1990 to 2001. We find that these mechanisms are strong complements, together producing annualized abnormal returns of 10 - 15 % depending on the proxy for internal governance. Internal governance is measured using data on block-holder and public pension fund holdings.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the {{characteristics}} of firms that introduced hostile <b>takeover</b> defense <b>measures</b> in fiscal years 2005 and 2006. We analyze the motivation for adopting these measures after categorizing it as either (1) depressed corporate performance, (2) self-protection for corporate managers, or (3) other factors affecting the probability of being {{the target of a}} takeover, and we derive the following findings. First, companies at which performance has deteriorated, as measured by such yardsticks as ROA and Tobin's q, do not necessarily adopt <b>takeover</b> defense <b>measures.</b> Second, companies that are older-established, have lower proportions of shares held by their directors, or higher cross-shareholding ratios are more likely to adopt <b>takeover</b> defense <b>measures,</b> which suggests that the adoption of such measures is influenced by self-protection on the part of corporate managers and conflicts of interest with shareholders. Third, companies with low ratios of controlling shareholders or high ratios of holdings by institutional investors are more inclined to adopt <b>takeover</b> defense <b>measures,</b> as are companies in which the shareholding structure is such that their shares are liquid and easy to acquire. From this, {{it can be seen that}} anti-takeover measures are not necessarily adopted as a "shield" or "entrenchment" against growing takeover threats resulting from negligence on the part of management. But the finding that companies with higher cross-shareholding ratios adopt <b>takeover</b> defense <b>measures</b> more readily is strong evidence of the self-protective nature of corporate managers. It is pointed out that the practice of cross-shareholding by Japanese companies has been reemerging recently amid the emergence of hostile takeovers in Japan. It appears that companies at which management has already dug entrenchments by means of cross-shareholding are seeking to reinforce those entrenchments by adopting anti-takeover measures, but it should also be noted that the adoption of measures of this kind involves a burden of fixed costs that could greatly disadvantage small companies. In view of this, it is important also to consider the approach (Tsuru 2006) that involves preventing abusive takeovers by strengthening the takeover bid rules (in particular the mandatory bid rule) as an alternative to the adoption of poison pill-type anti-takeover measures by individual companies. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} largely {{prompted}} by the two recently promulgated regulations governing takeovers in China. The goal {{of this article is}} to critically examine the legal takeover regime in China and to put forward proposals for reform. To outline the discussion, Part II describes the stock market, the takeover law, and the takeover activities in China. Two legislative goals, namely contestability of takeovers and shareholder protection, are set out in Part III. Under these principles, Part IV and Part V explore the issues of tender offer and <b>anti</b> <b>takeover</b> defenses, respectively. Specifically, Part IV focuses on information disclosure and other major rules relating to takeovers. It appears that these rules are in line with the international norm and acceptably workable in the context of China. Furthermore, Part V explores the serious problems that are associated with anti-takeover defenses. China's law seems to be both over inclusive and under inclusive in this respect. After an in depth comparative analysis of the legal regimes in the U. S., UK, and Australia, it is apparent that those regimes are not suitable for China's local conditions. Lastly, this article proposes a regime in which shareholders could veto the use of takeover defenses ex post, while requiring that certain defensive measures be decided ex ante. This proposal could well suit China's needs because it not only gives shareholders sufficient protection, but also preserves necessary flexibility for management to efficiently respond to truly undesirable tender offers...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{questions}} the common view that share price increases of firms involved in hostile <b>takeovers</b> <b>measure</b> efficiency gains from acquisitions. Even if such gains exist, {{most of the}} increase in the combined value of the target and the acquirer is likely to come from stakeholder wealth losses, such as declines in value of subcontractors' firm-specific capital or employees' human capital. The use of event studies to gauge wealth creation in takeovers is unjustified. The paper also suggests a theory of managerial behavior, in which hiring and entrenching trustworthy managers enables shareholders to commit to upholding implicit contracts with stakeholders. Hostile takeovers are an innovation allowing shareholders to renege on such contracts ex post, against managers' will. On this view, shareholder gains are redistributions from stakeholders, and can in the long run result in deterioration of trust necessary for the functioning of the corporation. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the interplay between}} takeover defenses and shareholder activism.

Activists are more likely to demand removal of <b>takeover</b> defense <b>measures</b> and/or sale of the target firm if the firm has a staggered board or a poison pill in place, suggesting that when takeover defenses block the market for corporate control, activists promote changes through their interventions. I also find that target firms with takeover defenses are more likely to remove those defenses and more likely to be acquired following activism, which suggests that activism can act as an antidote to takeover defenses. Finally, while many target firms adopt a poison pill in response to activist approaches, I do not find evidence that it makes for an effective defense...|$|R

Certain aspects of the event of Black Monday as it is called emphasised the need for research to explore what fundamental economic factors triggered the large decline and the institutional and structural factors that were inherent in the trading strategies of investors. Michell and Netter (1989) have presented evidence that a tax bill containing <b>anti</b> <b>takeover</b> provision proposed by the U. S.

Other events and economic conditions during October 14 – 16 have been cited in the literature including higher than expected trade deficits, rising interest rate and increased worries about the government deficit and fear of inflation by many studies. Certain trading strategies such as index arbitrage and portfolio insurance has been cited by the Report of Presidential Task Force (1988).

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} issues {{regarding}} which regime style {{would be appropriate}} for China to adopt in the regulation of takeover defences, given {{that there are two}} distinct takeover regulatory systems in the world – that of the UK, and that of the US. China has already adopted a UK-style shareholder-friendly regulatory system. This thesis considers the reasons why China has chosen a shareholder-friendly takeover regulatory system rather than a US-style director-friendly regulatory system. In addition, combining analysis of the character of China’s market and its legal framework, it discusses whether the current regulatory system is appropriate for China or not. Furthermore, it considers specific features of individual takeover defensive tactics and the possibility of their use being legitimised in China. This thesis is relevant because of the likelihood of the freeing up of the Chinese takeover market in the future; as this happens, there will be more and more takeover activity, taking place in China’s market. Thus it is important to provide adequate legislation for market players. Though China adopted the UK’s shareholder regulatory system many years ago, when it first regulated its takeover market, the shareholding structure in China is totally different to the UK’s, and so it is important to discuss whether this regulatory system is still relevant for China or whether there should be a change to a regulatory system more like that of the US. As China issued the Administrative Measures of Preferred Shares Experimental Units in 2014, and the new leadership in China has continued China’s economic reform over recent years, it i could be said that China’s listed companies have become more attractive to investors and there could be more hostile raiders entering the market. Hence {{there is a need to}} consider whether China’s delegation of decision-making powers to the shareholders regarding defence against hostile raiders is appropriate. It is also important to establish which <b>takeover</b> defence <b>measures</b> might appropriately be legalised and which would be inappropriate for China. Chapter 1 introduces background information about the trend of mergers and acquisitions and hostile takeovers, China’s state-owned enterprises and briefly consider <b>takeover</b> defensive <b>measures.</b> Following this, it discusses shareholding structures, and problems in China’s market in comparison with the UK and US. Chapter 2 outlines both the UK’s and US’s distinctive takeover regulatory systems and evaluates their pros and cons, as well as the reasons why certain regulatory systems are suitable for each market. Chapter 3 explores the differences between China’s ownership structure, market, and legal framework, and those of the UK and US. It also summarises the weaknesses of the Chinese system(s) in seeking to transplant a western-style set of takeover regulations into China’s market. Primarily, these are that (a) China does not provide sufficient legislation relating to <b>takeover</b> defence <b>measures</b> and (b) Chinese market players and legal advisors do not have adequate experience of <b>takeover</b> defence <b>measures.</b> ii Chapter 4 discusses <b>takeover</b> defence <b>measures</b> related to stock trading – share repurchase, the ‘pac-man’ defence, the use of white knights and ESOP. The chapter concludes that the first two tactics may be too risky for target companies such that their adoption should be prohibited in China while the latter two tactics may be helpful and could be widely used by China’s listed companies. Chapter 5 considers <b>takeover</b> defence <b>measures</b> related to management, such as poison pills, shark repellents, the scorched earth policy, dual class recapitalization and three kinds of parachutes. Except for the scorched earth policy, which could be harmful to the long-term interests of target companies, the other tactics may work well in China’s market and help Chinese companies secure controlling power or raise the share premium. Chapter 6 looks into defensive measures relating to litigation, raising anti-trust issues with relevant authorities, inadequate information provision by bidders and other crimes. It summarizes how measures relating to litigation could help delay the hostile takeover process, but could also terminate it, even if the target company is only seeking a greater share premium. This process could also involve government intervention, and its effectiveness cannot be guaranteed. Even if this group of measures are the most frequently used tactics by target companies, this thesis does not recommend it over other options. Chapter 7 analyses and compares the legislative systems of the US and UK and concludes that the UK’s system is better for contemporary China. However, there is iii still the potential for China to legalise certain <b>takeover</b> defensive <b>measures</b> in the future as China’s market is continually being reformed. Chapter 8 concludes the thesis in proposing that China is justified in adopting the UK’s shareholder-friendly regulatory system. This is partly based on consideration of promoting takeover activities, and the existence of China’s SOEs, which may be reasons to prohibit certain defensive measures in China’s market. As the reform of China’s market continues, moderate defensive tactics like the white knight, parachute system and poison pill could work well. However, the decision-making power should remain in the hands of shareholders and the government should provide sufficient supervision over the market whilst following the principle of protecting shareholders’ interests. The importance of the thesis, and its contribution to existing knowledge, is the research for it has found that most other researchers are focused on the mandatory bid rule – adopted from the UK – in China, but that hardly any systematic research is being undertaken into defensive measures. Thus, this thesis fills a gap in the current literature on the takeover regulations area for China. It also discusses most of the major takeover defensive tactics, analysing in which markets certain defensive tactics work, and whether they would be appropriate for China. Newly-released regulations show the intention of Chinese legislators to turn to a more US style – which will make certain <b>takeover</b> defence <b>measures</b> possible in China, such as the poison pill; whether these are suitable for the Chinese market is debatable. In addition, it is found that iv Chinese companies, especially high-tech companies, quite frequently use several defensive measures when they list on the US market, and the function of these tactics in securing control over the target company can be seen. Thus, research into how to regulate those defensive measures and what problems might arise with their use in China is important for regulators, and will make this thesis meaningful in China...|$|R

40|$|The {{takeover}} literature {{appears to}} lack comprehensive {{studies on the}} shareholder wealth effects of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in emerging markets (EMs). In this thesis, using a sample consisting of 542 initial takeover bids originating from 21 emerging economies, we provide a unified analysis of the value creation in M&A {{and the distribution of}} value between target- and bidder firms. Further, we examine the differences in value creation and value distribution between EMs and the United States (US) by including a control sample consisting of 2 379 US initial <b>takeover</b> bids. To <b>measure</b> value creation, we calculate both the capitalizationweighted combined cumulative abnormal returns surrounding the bid announcement, and the combined dollar returns per dollar spent on <b>takeovers.</b> To <b>measure</b> the value distribution, we calculate the difference in dollar returns received by the target and bidder, normalized by their combined pre-merger market capitalization, as well as the fraction of combined dollar returns received by the target. When analyzing the differences between EMs and the US, we control for commonly accepted deal-, firm-, and country characteristics. We find that while premiums received by targets are significantly lower in EMs than in the US, there is no significant difference in value creation. Further, EM targets receive a significantly smaller share of the value creation than their US counterparts. Hence, our results suggest that bargaining power is lower for EM targets. In addition, we present evidence indicating a positive relationship between the degree of corruption and target pre-announcement stock price runup...|$|R

40|$|The three {{chapters}} which comprise {{my thesis}} are {{a collection of}} essays on the analysis of the corporate governance and airline markets and of the federal appellate structure. In Chapter 1, I use a discrete choice framework to analyze state design and firm choice of the implications of incorporation: corporate governance laws, corporate taxes and court structure. Firms - differentiated on ownership, management, industry concentration, financial profile and unobservable dimensions - freely choose their preferred state of incorporation or reincorporation. The revealed preference embedded in this observable choice is used as window into the heterogeneous preferences within and across firms, yielding several findings: For example, I find, surprisingly, that firms are very responsive to incorporation and franchise taxes. In addition, on average, firms like <b>anti</b> <b>takeover</b> statutes, but, consistent with an agency story, firms with an institutional shareholder block and venture capital backed firms dislike them. On average, firms dislike mandatory governance statutes restricting managerial power and facilitating the representation of minority shareholders, but these laws are less restrictive for the choice of firms in concentrated industries. All firms dislike well functioning courts, consistent with a litigation deterrence motive. The recovered firm preferences are then taken to the simulation of recently proposed federal reforms aimed at centralizing the domicile implications and restricting firm choice. (cont.) They are also related to the documented differential returns earned by firms with better internal governance in the 1990 s, as well as to other (new) trading strategies that would have yielded abnormal returns in the 2000 s. Chapter 2 begins with the observation that airlines choose the domestic markets - city pairs - they serve and the prices they charge given the structure of their network and the networks of rival airlines. I cast this choice into a dynamic oligopoly entry game to recover airline fixed and variable operating costs, entry costs, and profits, using a panel of 20 quarters of DB 1 B and T- 100 Domestic Segment Data. These estimates are then used to analyze the strategic and cost saving effects of hubs, and LCC. I find that hubs are valuable to consumers and increase the variable profits of the hubbing airline, but when including fixed costs their desirability is much less clear. LCC, and especially Southwest and JetBlue are especially attractive to consumers, have lower marginal costs and have a strong negative impact on the profits of the incumbents in the markets they serve. In Chapter 3, using data on all federal civil trial and appellate cases from 1992 - 2003, I show that appeals are generally rejected and, for some case categories, can have negative expected net present value. Appellate outcomes can be further related to the trial decision being by judge or jury, the identity of the prevailing party (plaintiff or defendant, US or private), and the form of representation. Some of these factors influence the propensity to appeal, however, others, including whether trial was by judge or jury, go in the opposite way. (cont.) I discuss the implications of these findings for the modeling of the incentives to appeal and settlement breakdown, and for appellate reform. by Moshe Aharon Cohen. Thesis (Ph. D.)

This paper also examines whether the incremental value effect of dividends in entrenched firms is attributable to a numerator effect (changes in the future cash flow) or a denominator effect (changes in the discount rate). The empirical results show that the dividend payout of such firms is more positively related to future performance and more negatively related to information risk, which supports both numerator and denominator effects.

Laos, in particular, is a small country located in Southeast Asia that has recently gained prominence in spheres of international development and the global marketplace. Since the mid- 1980 s, leaders of the state have implemented economic reform in hopes of achieving greater economic gain. Their efforts fall short, however, when many marginalized communities comprised of ethnic minorities fall deeper into poverty. In search of a better life, many made the decision to flee the country to escape their impoverishment. Those with experiences of transnational migration have consequently encountered a new time and space, generating unique desires and discontents. Those who remained in Laos have shaped their desires and discontents on the structures, policies, and reforms pursued by the government.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Over {{the last several years}} (and especially since China's admission to the World Trade Organisation in 2001) merger and acquisition (M&A) activities in China have increased significantly {{as a result of the}} rapid growth in the Chinese economy and the measures which the Chinese government has taken to modernise the laws and regulations which govern its securities markets. Despite this, only a few researchers have studied M&A activities in China in any depth. Moreover, such research as has been conducted on Chinese M&A activities is mainly concerned with the laws and regulations affecting the area and not with their economic consequences. Hence, the particular concern of this dissertation is with the economic benefits that accrue to the shareholders of Chinese acquiring and target firms from the M&A activities that have occurred in the People s Republic of China over the last twenty years. In particular, our study encompasses a theoretical, institutional and empirical analysis of Chinese M&A activities. M&A activities in China are governed by a number of laws and regulations of which the <b>Takeover</b> <b>Measures,</b> 2006, is undoubtedly the most important. Our analysis in the early part of the dissertation summarises the legal framework under which M&A activities are conducted in China. In particular, the <b>Takeover</b> <b>Measures,</b> 2006 aim to make Chinese laws in the M&A area more compatible with best international practice. Furthermore, a new Anti-Monopoly Law, which addresses the anti-trust issues associated with mergers and acquisitions came into force on 1 August 2008. Amongst other things, this new Anti-Monopoly Law addresses issues of anti-trust and declaration thresholds in M&A activities in China. Besides these issues, the early chapters of the dissertation summarise the Chinese laws dealing with cross-border mergers and acquisitions, the laws relating to the issue of new shares, the laws relating to share swap transactions and the important provisions affecting the regulation of special purpose companies (SPCs). The dissertation then turns to an empirical analysis of the economic benefits which accrue to the shareholders of Chinese target and Chinese acquiring firms as a result of their M&A activities. Our analysis is based on the standard market model methodology using both the Dimson (1979) and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimates of equity betas. We also employ an hitherto unused nonparametric testing procedure based on the Corrado (1989) rank test in order to enhance the robustness of our empirical analysis. Suffice it to say that the empirical analysis summarised in the dissertation shows that there are significant abnormal returns around the takeover announcement date for the holders of equity securities in Chinese target firms. This is a result which mirrors much of the empirical research conducted on M&A activities in western economies. Interestingly, however, a significant proportion of these abnormal returns decay away within a few weeks following the takeover announcement date. In contrast, there are few, if any, economic benefits for the holders of equity securities in Chinese acquiring firms from their M&A activities. In this respect our results for Chinese acquiring firms are very similar to those obtained by researchers for western acquiring firms, although there are some important differences. In particular, there appear to be statistically significant and positive abnormal returns for shareholders of Chinese acquiring firms around the takeover announcement date but these generally decay away over the next ten to fifteen trading days thereby leaving the shareholders of Chinese acquiring firms with no significant benefits from their M&A activities. We provide some possible explanations for this phenomenon by linking our empirical results with the Chinese political, economic and capital systems. A fundamental decision the directors of acquiring firms must make is whether the mode of consideration for takeovers ought to be in cash or some alternative medium of exchange. Prior research in western countries shows that the mode of consideration used in takeovers can have a significant impact on the abnormal returns which accrue to the shareholders of both acquiring and target firms. Our empirical analysis of this issue shows that when the mode of consideration is purely in cash the abnormal returns which accrue to the shareholders of Chinese target firms around the takeover announcement date are positive and significantly different from zero. In contrast, there are no economic benefits (and indeed, probably economic losses) for the shareholders of Chinese target firms when the consideration for takeovers is other than purely in cash. For Chinese acquiring firms there are significant positive abnormal returns when the consideration for takeovers is other than purely in cash. However, when cash is used as the sole mode of consideration by Chinese acquiring firms there are very few, if any, economic benefits for their shareholders. The concluding sections of the dissertation note that our calculation of the abnormal returns that accrue to firms involved in Chinese M&A activities is based exclusively on the standard market model - which is empirical counterpart of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). In recent years, however, Fama and French (1992, 1993, 1995, 1996) amongst other authors have suggested that the CAPM has serious deficiencies and that these deficiencies flow through to the standard market model on which the empirical analysis of Chinese M&A activities summarised in this dissertation is based. We show, however, that the Fama and French Asset Pricing Model (1992, 1993, 1995, 1996) has numerous deficiencies of its own and that to base the calculation of abnormal returns upon this model has the potential to lead to a seriously flawed analysis of the abnormal returns which accrue to the shareholders of Chinese firms involved in M&A activities and on which our empirical analysis is based.

Privatised twenty years ago, subject to a price control regime which has permitted high levels of investment, and unchanged {{as a set of}} vertically integrated regional monopolies, the sector now faces fresh challenges associated in particular with the consequences of climate change. The review identified a programme for the introduction of competition and use of market-type instruments into the sector, beginning with opening up retailing to business customers and reforms of the arrangements for abstraction and discharge which are intended to achieve a more rational use of water resources and to stimulate trading across company boundaries. Then, subject to an appropriate governance structure, competition would be introduced into upstream treatment activities, either by the creation of a single buyer of wholesale water or through a common carriage regime. At the same time, the balance of risk of and return to companies' remaining regulated activities would be changed to encourage more innovative approaches, especially those which avoid heavy capital investment. Heightened stimuli to investment would also flow from relaxing restrictions on mergers and <b>takeovers,</b> and <b>measures</b> to enhance the innovative capabilities of companies. The paper explains the logic of the proposed measures and of their sequencing. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{find that}} the {{probability}} of all-stock financed <b>takeovers</b> increases with <b>measures</b> of bidder overvaluation. However, when we instrument the bidder's pricing error using aggregate mutual fund flows, the reverse happens: greater overvaluation reduces the all-stock financing propensity. Since shocks to aggregate fund flows are exogenous to the payment method choice - while directly impacting bidder pricing errors - this evidence strongly rejects the notion that all-stock financed takeovers are "market driven". Bidders paying with stock tend to be small, non-dividend paying growth companies with low leverage, that recently made a seasoned equity offering. We also show that all-stock financing is more likely in high-tech industries, when the target and bidder operate in highly complementary industries are geographically close - factors that suggest the target is relatively informed about true bidder value. Overall, the evidence does not suggest a particular role for market mispricing in driving all-stock financed takeovers...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether the takeover by Advanced Life Support [ALS] trained ambulance paramedics from rescuers using an automated external defibrillator [AED] delays shocks and if this delay is associated with decreased survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [OHCA]. Methods: We analyzed continuous ECG recordings of LIFEPAK AEDs and associated manual defibrillator recordings of OHCA of presumed cardiac cause, prospectively collected from July 2005 to July 2009. The primary outcome measure was survival to discharge. Among 693 patients treated with AEDs, I 10 had a shockable initial rhythm and a shockable rhythm during ALS <b>takeover.</b> We <b>measured</b> the time interval between the expected shock if the AED would remain attached to the patient and the first observed shock given by the manual defibrillator [shock timing]. Results: Survival was 62 % (13 / 21) if the shock was given early (150 s. The OR for trend was 0. 41, 95 % CI = 0. 25 - 0. 71; P = 0. 001. The association between shock timing and survival was significant for patients with more than 150 s shock delay (OR = 0. 19; 95 % CI = 0. 04 - 0. 71; P = 0. 02) or for trend in shock timing (0. 42, 95 % CI = 0. 20 - 0. 84; P = 0. 02) after multivariable adjustment for prognostic factors age and slope of ventricular fibrillation. Conclusions: ALS takeover delays the next shock delivery in almost two-third of cases. This delay is associated with decreased survival. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|R
40|$|Commentators {{have argued}} that {{employees}} should be compensated {{in the event of}} a hostile takeover; otherwise, the threat of such a takeover will fail to incentivize firm-specific investments by employees. Such deferred compensation is analogous to the payment of damages following a breach of contract. The analogous breach, here, is the breach of an implicit contract between management and employees. Employees trusted management to compensate them for firm-specific investments not explicitly contracted for. This Article uses a familiar result from the contract law literature: There is no measure of damages for breach of contract that can generate both efficient breach and efficient investment by parties to the relationship. While zero damages results in an inefficiently high likelihood of breach, expectation damages result in too much investment. Similarly, in the hostile <b>takeover</b> context, no <b>measure</b> of ex post compensation to employees can generate efficient takeovers from outside bidders and efficient firm-specific investment by employees. Measures of compensation that incentivize only those takeovers that are efficient will lead to overreliance, i. e., excessive firm-specific investments. Essentially, trying to plug one leak exposes another...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of {{the study}} According to theory of real options’ role in M&A, an {{acquiring}} company can gain value by enhancing the target company’s real options by lowering their exercise price, increasing upside potential of cash flows and allowing for improved timing of exercise or by seeking targets where real options’ value is available to a specific acquirer. This theoretical value creation potential should drive companies to seek targets with {{a large amount of}} their value attributable to real options. This thesis links theory to practice by covering the previously untouched topics of takeover risk of companies with different amounts of their value attributable to real options, development of real options for the acquiring company around the acquisition and the difference in post-acquisition performance between acquirers of real options intensive targets versus assets-in-place targets. By studying these effects, the questions whether companies indeed attempt to capture value in targets’ real options and importantly, are they capable in doing so, can be answered. Data and methodology The dataset of this thesis extends from January 1980 to December 2015 and includes NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ indexes. Stock data is gathered from CRSP and linked to fundamental data from Compustat. The measurement of real options intensity is conducted by measuring the correlation between contemporaneous volatility and stock returns for each sample company based on Grullon, Lyanders & Zhdanov (2012). The companies with the strongest correlation have the largest share of their value in real options. To <b>measure</b> <b>takeover</b> risk, companies are divided into deciles based on their real options intensity. The takeover risk between these deciles is studied via logit regression model. The development of real options for the acquirers is conducted by studying the aggregate time series of the return-volatility correlation coefficient around the acquisition. Last, post-acquisition returns are studied by dividing acquiring companies into two portfolios: acquirers of real options intensive companies versus acquirers of assets-in-place companies. Cumulative abnormal returns are studied based on commonly accepted calendar-time benchmark portfolio approach to study long-term M&A returns. Key findings The findings of this thesis support the hypothesis that on average, companies with a larger share of their value attributable to real options {{are more likely to be}} targets of acquisitions compared to companies where value is attributable to assets-in-place. An acquiring company benefits from acquisitions in flexibility, but acquisitions are driven partly by industry-wide factors. The findings of this thesis do no support the hypothesis that acquiring real options intensive companies would result in superior returns compared to acquiring assets-in-place targets or restraining from acquisition altogether...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Com.) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Commerce Faculty, 1986 Takeovers are an {{important}} economic activity appearing to affect both the current profitability and the growth prospects of the firms involved. The market’s perception of these synergies seems to {{be reflected in the}} share prices of both the acquired and acquiror companies. This dissertation examines the impact of takeovers on share prices on The Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), {{within the context of the}} efficient market hypothesis, during the period 1 January 1979 to 30 June 1984, and attempts to identify the number of months before the closing date of the offer that the market begins to anticipate the takeover. It is a study of an efficient market in the semi-strong form. The methodology used to identify the period when the market begins to anticipate the <b>takeover,</b> was to <b>measure</b> the residuals between the actual share f ^ prices and the expected share prices had there been no takeover, adjusted for movements in the market index, around the closing date to register for the j takeover offer. Significant departures from the normal residuals were | attributed to the takeover news. The market model, which has been tested in j South Africa and other countries for this type of study and for other tests of j the semi-strong form of the efficient market hypothesis, was used to estimate j [...] . expected ihare prices. i I. The dissertation also presents a theoretical discussion of the efficient 1 market hypothesis in Its three different forms and reviews the empirical jV research conducted on this theory, both in relation to takeovers and other I subjects, in South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. As regards the period when the market begins to anticipate the takeover) it was found that, on average, the market began to anticipate the takeover ! seven months before the closing date of the takeover offer for both acquired j» and acquiror companies. Whilst the JSE appears efficient in the timing of the ! takeover adjustment for both acquired and acquiror companies it appears that ! it may be inefficient In the assimilation of the accuracy of the takeover news as far as acquiror companies are concerned, It was also found that a larger !, proportion of companies taken over had negative residuals before the takeover 1 was discounted, and that a large proportion of acquiror companies reported negative residuals after the discounting of the takeover by the market...|$|R
