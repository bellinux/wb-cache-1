5000|$|On {{telecommunications}} circuits, disambiguation is {{a critical}} function of voice procedure. Due to any number of variables, including radio static, a busy or loud environment, or similarity in the phonetics of different words, a critical piece of information can be misheard or misunderstood; for instance, a pilot being ordered to eleven thousand as opposed to seven thousand. To reduce ambiguity, critical information may be broken down and read as separate letters and numbers. To avoid error or misunderstanding, pilots will often read back altitudes {{in the tens of}} thousands using both separate numbers and the single word (example: given a climb to 10,000 ft, the pilot replies [...] "Callsign climbing to One zero, Ten Thousand"). However, this is usually only used to differentiate between 10,000 and 11,000 ft since these are the most common <b>altitude</b> <b>deviations.</b> The runway number read visually as eighteen, when read over a voice circuit as part of an instruction, becomes one eight. In some cases a spelling alphabet is used (also called a radio alphabet or a phonetic alphabet). Instead of the letters AB, the words Alpha Bravo are used. Main Street becomes Mike Alpha India November street, clearly separating it from Drain Street and Wayne Street. The numbers 5 and 9 are pronounced [...] "fife" [...] and [...] "niner" [...] respectively, since [...] "five" [...] and [...] "nine" [...] can sound the same over the radio. The use of 'niner' in place of 'nine' is due to German-speaking NATO allies for whom the spoken word 'nine' could be confused with the German word 'nein' or 'no'.|$|E

A trajectory is computed {{for a given}} aircraft/control law configuration and given microburst parameters (either a downdraft or a head/tailwind type microburst). The maximum deviation from the nominal altitude is recorded for that trajectory. Then the microburst parameters are varied, and the process is repeated. Thus a three dimensional plot of maximum <b>altitude</b> <b>deviation</b> versus microburst range scale and intensity is generated. Finally, a certain maximum <b>altitude</b> <b>deviation,</b> say 50 feet, {{is defined as the}} safe penetration limit.

This experience can be very helpful in the design and implementation of similar systems for nuclear power plants. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) sponsored a study at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) to investigate pilot errors that occur during interaction with automated systems in advanced technology aircraft. In particular, we investigated the causes and potential corrective measures for pilot errors that resulted in <b>altitude</b> <b>deviation</b> incidents (i. e. failure to capture or maintain the altitude assigned by air traffic control). To do this, we analyzed <b>altitude</b> <b>deviation</b> events that {{have been reported in the}} Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS), NASA`s data base of incidents self-reported by pilots and air traffic controllers. We developed models of the pilot tasks that are performed to capture and maintain altitude.

This paper reviews some of the problems that have resulted from the introduction of glass cockpit aircraft, the methodology used to analyze pilot errors, the lessons learned from the study of <b>altitude</b> <b>deviation</b> events, and the application of the results to the introduction of computer-based human support systems in nuclear power plants.

40|$|Abstract. Flying insects use highly {{efficient}} visual strategies {{to control their}} self-motion in three-dimensional space. We present a biologically inspired, minimalistic model for visual flight control in an autonomous agent. Large, specialized receptive fields exploit the distribution of local intensities and local motion in an omnidirectional field of view, extracting the information required for attitude control, course stabilization, obstacle avoidance, and altitude control. In openloop simulations, recordings from each control mechanism robustly indicate the sign of attitude angles, self-rotation, obstacle direction and <b>altitude</b> <b>deviation,</b> respectively. Closed-loop experiments show that these signals are sufficient for three-dimensional flight stabilization with six degrees of freedom. ...|$|R

In order to separate such cloud parameters one by one, it seems necessary to introduce information obtained at other wavelength regions. The cloud <b>altitude</b> <b>deviation</b> is determined from 2.02 -µm brightness by using information on cloud optical thickness from the 0.90 -µm dayside image; the temperature information may be determined from the 10 -µm brightness by using the cloud optical thickness and the altitude information obtained from the 0.90 -µm and the 2.02 -µm regions.|$|R
30|$|The error {{associated}} with this procedure may be estimated as follows only if the random error of 0.3 % in the 0.90 -µm dayside image is important.

This error corresponds to about unity in the optical thickness in the 0.90 -µm image according to Fig. 5. Since the reference value of the total cloud optical thickness is 34, as noted in Table 2, such uncertainties of unity in cloud optical thickness may be converted into an error of 0.03 km in the cloud <b>altitude</b> <b>deviation</b> according to Fig. 7.

40|$|The dynamic {{response}} of aircraft-autopilot systems to atmospheric disturbances was investigated by analyzing linearized models of aircraft dynamics and altitude hold autopilots. Four jet aircraft (Boeing 737 - 100, McDonald Douglas DC 9 - 30, Lockheed L- 10 ll, and Cessna Citation III) were studied at three flight levels (FL 290, FL 330, and FL 370). The models were analyzed {{to determine the}} extent to which pressure surface fluctuations, vertical gusts, and horizontal gusts cause assigned <b>altitude</b> <b>deviations</b> by coupling with the aircraft-autopilot dynamics. The results of this analysis were examined in light of meteorological data on disturbance magnitudes and wavelengths collected from observations of mountain wave activity. This examination revealed that atmospheric conditions do exist which can cause aircraft to exhibit assigned <b>altitude</b> <b>deviations</b> in excess of 1, 000 ft. Pressure surface fluctuations were observed to be the dominant source of altitude errors in flights through extreme mountain wave activity. Based on the linear analysis the maximum tolerable pressure surface fluctuation amplitude was determined as a function of wavelength for an allowable altitude error margin of 300 ft. The results of this analysis provide guidance for the determination of vertical separation standards in the presence of atmospheric disturbances. Cover titleJanuary 1988 Also issued as an M.

30|$|A {{procedure}} {{to determine the}} source and the representative altitude of the contrast seen in infrared images has been carried out. We show {{that the source of}} the small contrast expected in the 0.90 -µm image is mostly caused by inhomogeneity in cloud optical thickness. We also show that the source of the large contrast expected in the 2.26 -µm nightside image is also caused by inhomogeneity in the cloud optical thickness. Our attempt to determine the representative altitudes of these cloud layers revealed that this spectral band is sensitive to any cloud region (upper, middle and lower), but not sensitive to the upper haze region. This result is not always consistent with results reported by other researchers (e.g., Belton et al, 1991; Carlson et al, 1991). Cloud <b>altitude</b> <b>deviation</b> determined from the 2.02 -μm brightness may be affected by inhomogeneity in the cloud optical thickness. The temperature deviation determined from the 10 -µm brightness was found to be affected by the deviations in cloud optical thickness and cloud altitude. Cloud optical thickness, cloud altitude, and temperature information may be determined separately by introducing information obtained from other wavelength regions. Future studies should consider acidity as a parameter in addition to cloud thickness, height, and temperature, as indicated by Tsang et al. (2010).|$|R

40|$|The Traffic {{alert and}} Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) is an {{aircraft}} {{collision avoidance system}} designed to prevent mid-air collisions. During an advisory, danger is imminent, and TCAS is assumed to have better, more up-to-date information than the ground operated air traffic control (ATC) facility. Following a TCAS RA is generally the safe course of action during an advisory. However, pilot compliance with RAs is surprisingly low. Results from a TCAS monitoring study show pilots are not complying with many TCAS advisories. As revealed by pilot-submitted Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) reports, this noncompliance could be attributed, in part, to pilot confusion to TCAS operation as well as misunderstandings of the appropriate response to a TCAS issued advisory. This thesis details the development and evaluation of a TCAS training program intended to improve pilots' understanding of TCAS use for collision avoidance {{in a range of}} traffic situations. The training program integrated Demonstration Based and Event Based Training techniques. Its efficacy was analyzed in an integrated ATC-cockpit simulator study in which eighteen commercial airline pilots were asked to complete the TCAS training program and afterwards experienced twelve experimental traffic events. The trained pilots' performance was compared to the performance of 16 baseline pilots who did not receive the modified training. Overall, the training program did {{have a significant impact on}} the pilots' behavior and response to TCAS advisories. The measure Time Pilots First Achieved Compliance decreased with the trained pilots, as did the measure Autopilot Disconnect Time After RA Initiation. Trained pilots exhibited less aggressive performance in response to a TCAS RA (including a decrease in the measures <b>Altitude</b> <b>Deviation</b> Over Duration Of RA, Average Vertical Rate Difference, Maximum Vertical Rate Difference, and Maximum Vertical Rate). The measure Percent Compliance did not significantly vary between trained and baseline pilots, although trained pilots had a more consistent response in the traffic event with conflicting ATC guidance. Finally, on the post-experiment questionnaires, pilots commented on their increase in understanding of TCAS as well as an increase in their trust in the advisory system. Results of this research inform TCAS training objectives provided by the FAA as well as the design of TCAS training. Additionally, conclusions extend more broadly to improved training techniques for other similar complex, time-critical situations. MSCommittee Chair: Amy R. Pritchett; Committee Member: Karen M.
