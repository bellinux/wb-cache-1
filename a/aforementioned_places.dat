It was then under Shahriman's son, named Sarhat (also referred to as Khvajeh Sarhat), in the mid-17th century, that the family's wealth, prestige, and influence grew. A key aspect that differs the Scerimans from other Armenian merchants from Julfa, was that the Scerimans by origin and specialisation focused primaly on diamonds and gems, whereas most other Armenians from the <b>aforementioned</b> <b>place</b> specialized in the trade of silk with Europe.

40|$|This work {{investigated}} the cytotoxic and genotoxic potential {{of water from}} the River Paraíba do Sul (Brazil) using Allium cepa roots. An anatomo-morphological parameter (root length), mitotic indices, and frequency of micronuclei were analysed. Eight bulbs were chosen at random for treatment for 24 to 120 hours with the River water collected in the years of 2005 and 2006 from sites in the cities of Tremembé and Aparecida (São Paulo state, Brazil). Daily measurements of the length of the roots grown from each bulb were carried out throughout the experiment. Mitotic index (MI) and frequency of micronuclei (MN) were determined for 2000 cells per root, using 3 - 5 root tips from other bulbs (7 - 10). Only in the roots treated with samples of the River water collected in 2005 in Tremembé city was there a decrease in the root length growth compared to the respective control. However, a reduction in MI values was verified for both sites analysed for that year. Considering the data involving root length growth and especially MI values, a cytotoxic potential is suggested for the water of the River Paraíba do Sul at Tremembé and Aparecida, in the year of 2005. On the other hand, since in this year the MN frequency was not affected with the river water treatments, genotoxicity is not assumed for the river water sampled at the <b>aforementioned</b> <b>places...</b>|$|E

30|$|In {{the second}} case, {{a study of}} the multiple-machine {{representation}} focuses on selecting reasonable clustering indices by quantifying and abstracting key features of wind turbines. The coherency method is presented by clustering wind turbines according to different wind speeds (Fernández et al. 2009; Zubia et al. 2012). In the research work (Ali et al. 2013) the wind direction is taken into consideration. Then, generator speed, stator voltage, q-axis component of stator current, and real-time active power are also implemented as clustering indices (Zou et al. 2015). To represent the power loss on the collective network within the WPP, Muljadi et al. (2006) introduce a method of calculating the equivalent parameters of line and cable. Moreover, Cheng et al.

40|$|Melanoma {{develops}} from melanocytes localized {{mainly in}} skin, {{to a lesser}} extent in uvea and mucosal tissue. It {{is one of the most}} aggressive tumors, resistant to standard therapies. It is caused mainly by UV radiation. Approximately 10 � 0 of melanomas have a familial background.  Transformation of melanocytes is driven mainly by mutations in genes coding for proteins regulating proliferation, cell growth, cell cycle, and death. Although genetic changes are indisputable causes of melanoma formation, the key role of the skin microenvironment is becoming more and more acknowledged.  Normal cells of the skin, such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial, and immune cells, alongside melanocytes constitute a special microenvironment in which disturbed homeostasis may facilitate melanoma development. The process of transformation is initiated by aberrant interaction of keratinocytes and melanocytes. Proliferation and invasive growth of the developing neoplasm may be further facilitated by myofibroblasts as well as macrophages residing within the tumor. They are able to stimulate angiogenesis and suppress the immune response. Macrophages may, additionally, create aggressive hybrid cells through fusion with melanoma cells. Indispensable in the process of metastasis are endothelial cells which co-form blood vessels, the main routes of tumor cells’ seeding. All of the <b>aforementioned</b> processes take <b>place</b> in a tumor growth-promoting atmosphere of low oxygen tension in the skin, further decreasing during tumor growth.
