5|$|Adam is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in the fourth season of the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Portrayed by George Hertzberg, he is a monster created from a man and the collected parts of demons, vampires, and technology: the product of <b>a</b> <b>perverse</b> experiment carried out by military scientists. The series' main character, Buffy Summers, encounters and ultimately defeats him in the fourth season. Adam {{is the creation of}} Dr. Maggie Walsh (Lindsay Crouse), the head of a military-like organization called The Initiative that studies how to alter the harmful behavior inherent to demons. Adam and the Initiative are the fourth season's primary antagonists, or Big Bad.|$|E
5|$|Vincent DiStephano was not {{included}} in the original screenplay for Alien: Resurrection, but director Jean-Pierre Jeunet admired Cruz' previous work and had casting director Rick Pagano arrange a meeting. DiStephano was added to the cast as the remaining soldier and guide for the band of survivors. In Alien Zone II: The Spaces of Science-fiction Cinema, Annette Kuhn calls DiStephano's death at the hands of the Newborn <b>a</b> <b>perverse</b> joke because of its juxtaposition of infantile features and curiosity with gruesome killing.|$|E
5|$|The {{employer}} mandate requires employers meeting certain {{criteria to}} provide health insurance to their workers. The mandate applies to employers with more than 50 employees that do not offer health insurance to their full-time workers. Critics claimed that the mandate created <b>a</b> <b>perverse</b> incentive for business to keep their full-time headcount below 50 and to hire part-time workers instead. Between March 2010 and 2014 the number of part-time jobs declined by 230,000, {{while the number of}} full-time jobs increased by 2 million. In the public sector full-time jobs turned into part-time jobs much more than in the private sector. A 2016 study found only limited evidence that ACA had increased part-time employment.|$|E

25|$|When {{compared}} to other literary vampires of the 19th century, Carmilla is a similar product of a culture with strict sexual mores and tangible religious fear. While Carmilla selected exclusively female victims, she only becomes emotionally involved with a few. Carmilla had nocturnal habits, but was {{not confined to the}} darkness. She had unearthly beauty, and was able to change her form and to pass through solid walls. Her animal alter ego was a monstrous black cat, not a large dog as in Dracula. She did, however, sleep in a coffin. Carmilla works as a Gothic horror story because her victims are portrayed as succumbing to <b>a</b> <b>perverse</b> and unholy temptation that has severe metaphysical consequences for them.|$|E
25|$|He {{believed}} that productivity gains that obviated certain jobs would nevertheless stimulate the larger economy and thus grow new jobs elsewhere, whether {{within the same}} corporation or in others. Ford also {{believed that}} union leaders had <b>a</b> <b>perverse</b> incentive to foment perpetual socio-economic crisis {{as a way to}} maintain their own power. Meanwhile, he believed that smart managers had an incentive to do right by their workers, because doing so would maximize their own profits. Ford did acknowledge, however, that many managers were basically too bad at managing to understand this fact. But Ford believed that eventually, if good managers such as he could fend off the attacks of misguided people from both left and right (i.e., both socialists and bad-manager reactionaries), the good managers would create a socio-economic system wherein neither bad management nor bad unions could find enough support to continue existing.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{illustrate}} such points, Volya Rossii published fragments {{of works by}} Zamyatin, but also by Isaac Babel and Mikhail Sholokhov, alongside Guillaume Apollinaire or Karel Čapek. Volya Rossii soon patronized a generation of émigré modernists, beginning with Tsvetaeva and Aleksey Remizov, followed later by Nina Berberova, Dovid Knut, Valentin Parnakh, Vladimir Pozner, Gleb Struve, and Yuri Terapiano. However, Slonim's encouragement had <b>a</b> <b>perverse</b> effect: in Russia, authors praised by Slonim or sampled in Volya Rossii were singled out as potential enemies of the regime. In 1927, the magazine hosted fragments from Zamyatin's novel We, the first publication of that work in its original Russian. In order not to expose the author's direct contacts with the émigrés, Slonim claimed that these were back-translations from Czech and English reprints. Later, Slonim's positive reviews of Krasnaya Nov' magazine were used against its editor, Aleksandr Voronsky, who was eventually purged from the Soviet Communist Party.|$|E

25|$|Some Medicare {{supplemental}} insurance (or “Medigap”) plans {{cover all}} of an enrollee's cost-sharing, insulating them from any out-of-pocket costs and guaranteeing financial security to individuals with significant health care needs. Many policymakers {{believe that such}} plans raise the cost of Medicare by creating <b>a</b> <b>perverse</b> incentive that leads patients to seek unnecessary, costly treatments. Many argue that unnecessary treatments are {{a major cause of}} rising costs and propose that people with Medicare should feel more of the cost of their care to create incentives to seek the most efficient alternatives. Various restrictions and surcharges on Medigap coverage have appeared in recent deficit reduction proposals. One of the furthest-reaching reforms proposed, which would prevent Medigap from covering any of the first $500 of coinsurance charges and limit it to covering 50 percent of all costs beyond that, could save $50 billion over 10 years. But it would also increase health care costs substantially for people with costly health care needs.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{generally}} well received by critics, who particularly noted the puns. According to author Erwan Chuberre, the lyrics are [...] "as funny as disillusioned" [...] and Farmer uses puns that [...] "highlight her immoderate pleasure for impolite pleasures", with a music he deemed [...] "effective". Author Thierry Desaules {{said that the}} song {{appears to be a}} childish fairly tale, but is actually structured in <b>a</b> <b>perverse</b> enough way to address the adult public, as the allusions to the spanking can be seen as references to sadomasochism. Journalist Benoît Cachin wrote that her puns are [...] "of the funniest" [...] and that the singer included in the lyrics [...] "some very personal thoughts", including sadness; he added that Farmer appears to be [...] "fun, dynamic and delightfully mischievous" [...] on this song.|$|E
500|$|In a 1984 {{interview}} Farmer {{discussed the}} song's lyrics, stating: [...] "It {{can happen to}} many children who are in hospital [...] the nurses feed these children, tuck them into bed, kiss them before they sleep and therefore {{take the place of}} their mothers. So it is a little girl who tells her mother: I love the nurse". She said in another interview: [...] "But if people prefer to give this song <b>a</b> <b>perverse</b> sense, it is their problem". Thus, she does not confirm the lesbian allusions that seem to emerge from the chorus (the French verb [...] "aimer" [...] can mean either [...] "to love" [...] or [...] "to like"). However, the song has been listed in several books dealing with homosexuality and explains the fact that many gay people were immediately attracted to Farmer's world.|$|E
500|$|In 1879 the Chairman, Lord Provost Leslie, {{died and}} was {{replaced}} by William Ferguson of Kinmundy. The following year both the Secretary and General Manager resigned and William Moffatt was appointed to both posts, and A.G. Reid became Superintendent of the Line. The railway was now paying a dividend and seeing increased traffic, but rolling stock, track, signals and stations all needed replacing in a project that was to cost £250,000 (...) [...] By June 1880 the main line was doubled as far as Kintore, and {{over the next five years}} [...] of iron rail track, much of it without fishplates, was replaced with steel rails and the main line doubled to Inveramsay. The railway had acquired a reputation for running slow trains on <b>a</b> <b>perverse</b> timetable and ill-treating its passengers, and now resolved to address this. By the mid-1880s services were faster, there was upholstery in third class and the branches saw an accelerated service as a result of running fewer mixed trains.|$|E

500|$|The four {{officers}} were {{taken aback by}} Taylor's searing words and felt they had been humiliated. A decade after the incident, Kỳ described Taylor as [...] "the sort of man who addressed people rather than talked to them", referencing the confrontation. Karnow said [...] "For the sake of their own pride, they [...] resented being treated in ways that reminded them of their almost total dependence on an alien power. How could they preserve a sense of sovereignty when Taylor, striving to push them into 'getting things done', behaved like a viceroy?" [...] However, Thi also took <b>a</b> <b>perverse</b> pleasure in riling Taylor. He was seen by a CIA officer soon after, grinning. When asked why he was happy, Thi said [...] "Because {{this is one of}} the happiest days of my life...Today I told the American ambassador that he could not dictate to us." [...] Nevertheless, Taylor's conduct had rankled the officers, stirring their latent sense of nationalism and anti-Americanism; Khánh would exploit this to strengthen his fragile position in the junta.|$|E
500|$|Poe {{wrote the}} poem as a narrative, without {{intentionally}} creating an allegory or falling into didacticism. The main {{theme of the}} poem is one of undying devotion. The narrator experiences <b>a</b> <b>perverse</b> conflict between desire to forget and desire to remember. He seems to get some pleasure from focusing on loss. The narrator assumes that the word [...] "Nevermore" [...] is the raven's [...] "only stock and store", and, yet, he continues to ask it questions, knowing what the answer will be. His questions, then, are purposely self-deprecating and further incite his feelings of loss. Poe leaves it unclear if the raven actually {{knows what it is}} saying or if it really intends to cause a reaction in the poem's narrator. The narrator begins as [...] "weak and weary," [...] becomes regretful and grief-stricken, before passing into a frenzy and, finally, madness. Christopher F. S. Maligec suggests the poem is a type of elegiac paraclausithyron, an ancient Greek and Roman poetic form consisting of the lament of an excluded, locked-out lover at the sealed door of his beloved.|$|E
500|$|RMS Titanic Inc. {{has also}} {{attempted}} to secure exclusive physical {{access to the}} wreck site. In 1996, it obtained a court order finding that it had [...] "the exclusive right to take any and all types of photographic images of the Titanic wreck and wreck site." [...] It obtained another order in 1998 against Deep Ocean Expeditions and Chris Haver, a British Virgin Islands corporation that aimed to run tourist trips to Titanic {{at a cost of}} $32,000 per person (it now charges $60,000). This was overturned in March 1999 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which ruled that the law of salvage did not extend to obtaining exclusive rights to view, visit and photograph a wreck. The court pointed out that Titanic is [...] "located in a public place" [...] in international waters, rather than in a private or controllable location to which access could be restricted by the owner. Granting such a right would also create <b>a</b> <b>perverse</b> incentive; since the aim of salvage is to carry out a salvage operation, leaving property in place so that it could be photographed would run counter to this objective.|$|E

However, the marriage was happy and she was a great source of inspiration to her husband in works up to and including the Four Last Songs. In particular, Strauss portrayed de Ahna both as the hero's companion in Ein Heldenleben and in several sections of Symphonia Domestica. Strauss's opera Intermezzo (Dresden, 1924) provides a thinly veiled portrait of their marriage.|$|R

500|$|Denning {{writes that}} the real {{challenge}} is keeping up with technological change, and in this sense, scientific management was the key American technological advance in the 20th century. It allowed American companies to provide large numbers of jobs to semi-skilled workers through supply-chain management, hierarchies, and rule-based systems. Businesses must now adjust to well-informed consumers who disdain profiteering and wish to be [...] "delighted". A related challenge is shifting from managing semi-skilled to knowledge workers. The Economist contrasted the [...] "Great Stagnation" [...] thesis with the [...] "Great Divergence" [...] which traces the pay gap to an increasing demand for skilled workers. Timothy Noah, writing in Slate, did not share Cowen's optimism {{about the future of}} American educational attainment on the basis that President Obama [...] "is getting tough" [...] on teachers' unions. There have been many reforms implemented in the last thirty years that the unions initially opposed, and the United States has poorer outcomes than many OECD countries with stronger unions. Noah reminds us that the earlier authors were optimistic about increased third level enrollment and that has since fallen as have graduation rates. The United States remains significantly behind other advanced countries in educational outcomes offering <b>a</b> <b>perverse</b> hope for improvement.|$|E

500|$|By June {{the stench}} {{from the river}} had become so bad that {{business}} in Parliament was affected, and the curtains on the river {{side of the building}} were soaked in lime chloride to overcome the smell. The measure was not successful, and discussions were held about possibly moving the business of government to Oxford or St Albans. The Examiner reported that Disraeli, on attending one of the committee rooms, left shortly afterwards with {{the other members of the}} committee, [...] "with a mass of papers in one hand, and with his pocket handkerchief applied to his nose" [...] because the smell was so bad. The disruption to its legislative work led to questions being raised in the House of Commons. According to Hansard, the Member of Parliament (MP) John Brady informed Manners that members were unable to use either the Committee Rooms or the Library because of the stench, and asked the minister [...] "if the noble Lord has taken any measures for mitigating the effluvium and discontinuing the nuisance". Manners replied that the Thames was not under his jurisdiction. Four days later a second MP said to Manners that [...] "By <b>a</b> <b>perverse</b> ingenuity, one of the noblest of rivers has been changed into a cesspool, and I wish to ask whether Her Majesty's Government intend to take any steps to remedy the evil?" [...] Manners pointed out [...] "that Her Majesty's Government have nothing whatever to do with the state of the Thames". The satirical magazine Punch commented that [...] "The one absorbing topic in both Houses of Parliament... was the Conspiracy to Poison question. Of the guilt of that old offender, Father Thames, there was the most ample evidence".|$|E
