Using two discharge rates 5 l/s and 10 l/s and varying the direction <b>of</b> <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the upstream <b>dam,</b> observations were made {{of the changes in}} the channel-bed conformation. With either rate of discharge, a severe localized scour occurred at a particular spot under the concave bank, when the damaxis was placed {{in the direction of the}} centre of curvature of the channel, the deepest spot being located further upstream in the case of the less discharge. As the axis was so rotated that the concave-bank end turned downstream, the scour diminished rapidly, the eroded depth along the outer bank becoming sensibly uniform. It increased again, however, with a further rotation <b>of</b> the <b>axis.</b> The optimum angle of rotation for the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the upstream <b>dam,</b> when scour was the slightest, was ascertained to be about 15 ° for the discharge 10 l/s and about 5 ° for 5 l/s. With the latter rate of discharge, an appreciable scour was observed back <b>of</b> the downstream <b>dam</b> in close proximity to the outer bank, when the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the upper <b>dam</b> was inclined some twenty degrees to the initial direction...|$|R
50|$|Lake Fife {{was already}} 90% full, with water flowing in freely from Varasgaon, besides the {{abundant}} rainfall. The people of Pune {{had no idea}} of their fate. The rain caused such a rapid rise of the reservoir water level at Panshet that the new embankment could not adjust to the dangerous loading condition. Water rose at the rate of 9 m per day initially, and 24 m in 12 days. Due to incomplete rough outlet surface, the flow through was unsteady which caused pressure surges. Cracks were formed along the edges of the right angles to the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dam</b> causing a subsidence 9 m wide, leaving the crest <b>of</b> the <b>dam</b> 0.6 m above the reservoir level on July 11. The failure was attributed to inadequate provision of the outlet facility during emergency. This caused the fateful collapse of the structure above the outlets.|$|R

A penstock pipe of 3.2 m diameter (12 mm thick) and 70 m length embedded in the dam diverts the flow of [...] from a gate controlled trash racks (15 panels) covered intake into the powerhouse.

Throughout the 1860s, Bidaut undertook engineering studies for the reservoir with Donckier and Jamblinnes. Water distribution was studied by Cariez and Moulon.

40|$|A {{few studies}} {{indicate}} that limited nesting stress (LNS) alters maternal behavior and the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>dams</b> and offspring in male Sprague Dawley rats. In the present study, we evaluated the impact of LNS on maternal behavior in Wistar rats, and on the HPA axis, glycemia and in vivo intestinal permeability {{of male and female}} offspring. Intestinal permeability is known to be elevated during the first week postnatally and influenced by glucocorticoids. Dams and neonatal litters were subjected to LNS or normal nesting conditions (control) from days 2 to 10 postnatally. At day 10, blood was collected from pups for determination of glucose and plasma corticosterone by enzyme immunoassay and in vivo intestinal permeability by oral gavage of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran 4 kDa. Dams exposed to LNS compared to control showed an increase in the percentage of time spent building a nest (118 %), self-grooming (69 %), and putting the pups back to the nest (167 %). LNS male and female pups exhibited a reduction of body weight by 5 % and 4 %, adrenal weights/ 100 g body weight by 17 % and 18 %, corticosterone plasma levels by 64 % and 62 % and blood glucose by 11 % and 12 % respectively compared to same sex control pups. In male LNS pups, intestinal permeability was increased by 2. 7 -fold while no change was observed in females compared to same sex control. There was no sex difference in any of the parameters in control pups except the body weight. These data indicate that Wistar dams subjected to LNS during the first postnatal week have an altered repertoire of maternal behaviors which affects the development <b>of</b> the HPA <b>axis</b> in both sexes and intestinal barrier function in male offspring...|$|R

The results of calculations made using the two applied variants were very similar, thus indicating a minuscule number of stray points. Very reliable results were already obtained when using the quantile of 0. 998. The results of the measurements and the calculations of shading at the Moste mobile automatic weather station, over a period of seven consecutive clear days in early August 2013, showed very good agreement, confirming that the described method for determining of shading is highly reliable...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Dams are {{structures}} that dam {{rivers and streams}} {{for a variety of}} purposes.

The constant maintenance of these structures is essential, since a possible accident can lead to damage of catastrophic proportions.
