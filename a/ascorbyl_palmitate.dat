40|$|Chemically stable ester {{derivatives}} of vitamins A, C and E {{have become a}} focus of interest for {{their role in the}} satisfactory results in skin aging treatments. Accordingly, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the physical and chemical stability of a cosmetic formulation containing 1 % retinyl <b>palmitate,</b> <b>ascorbyl</b> tetraisopalmitate and tocopheryl acetate, alone or in combination. In the studies of physical stability, a Brookfield rheometer was used to determine rheological behavior of formulations containing the vitamins. Chemical stability was determined by HPLC on a Shimadzu system with UV detection. Results showed that formulations had pseudoplastic behavior and that vitamins did not alter their apparent viscosity and thixotropy. In the chemical stability studies, first-order reaction equations were used for determinations of the shelf-life of vitamins derivatives considering a remaining concentration of 85 %. Combined vitamins in a single formulation had a slightly lower degradation rate as compared to different preparations containing only one of the vitamins. Considering that many cosmetic formulations contain vitamin combinations it is suggested that the present study may contribute to the development of more stable formulations containing liposoluble vitamins.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to test {{innovative}} approach for enhancing <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> stability in microemulsions for topical application by addition of newly synthesized co-antioxidant 4 -(tridecyloxy) benzaldehyde oxime (TDBO) and to investigate its antioxidant activity and finally to evaluate cytotoxicity of TDBO-loaded microemulsions on keratinocyte cells. TDBO significantly increased <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> stability in oil-dispersed-in-water (o/w) microemulsions, most presumably due to reduction of <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> radical back to <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>palmitate,</b> since TDBO free-radical scavenging activity was confirmed.

40|$|Initiation of {{celiac disease}} is {{triggered}} in the gastrointestinal tract by transglutaminase 2 (TG 2) assisted deamidation of gluten peptides. Deamidation is a side-reaction to transamidation and occurs if primary amines are absent. In contrast to deamidation, transamidation does not trigger an immune response. The {{aim of the}} study was to identify a suitable food additive that interacts with TG 2 binding motives in gluten-derived peptides to prevent deamidation/transamidation. Homology modelling of alpha 2 -gliadin and computational screening of compounds for their binding affinity to a common TG 2 binding motive (P) QLP were done by using computational approaches followed by experimental testing of TG 2 activity.

40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{effects of}} beta-carotene, oil-soluble (bixin) and water-soluble (norbixin) annatto preparations and mixtures of these carotenoids with {{virgin olive oil}} polar extract were assessed in bulk olive oil and oil-in-water emulsions stored at 60 degreesC. Norbixin was the only carotenoid that inhibited the oxidative deterioration of lipids in both systems. Though bixin and beta-carotene did not retard autoxidation, their mixtures with the polar extract from virgin olive oil enhanced the antioxidant effect of the olive oil extract. Norbixin (2 mM) was of similar activity to delta-tocopherol (0. 1 mM) in stored oil. The combination of norbixin with ascorbic acid or <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> in oil showed a reduction in formation of volatile oxidation products but not in peroxide value, compared with the analogous sample lacking norbixin. In olive oil-in-water emulsions, norbixin (2 mM) reduced hydroperoxide formation to a similar extent as delta-tocopherol (0. 1 mM), which in turn was a better antioxidant than alpha-tocopherol.

40|$|Vitamin C is {{essential}} for primates, guinea pigs and fish. Vitamin C, {{in the form of}} ascorbic acid and its calcium and sodium salts, <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>palmitate,</b> sodium calcium ascorbyl phosphate and sodium ascorbyl phosphate, is safe for all animal species. Setting a maximum content in feed and water for drinking is not considered necessary. Data on the vitamin C consumption of consumers are based on the levels of vitamin C in foodstuffs, including food of animal origin, produced in accordance with current EU legislation on the supplementation of feed with vitamin C. The exposure is far below the guidance level. Any potential contribution of the use of vitamin C in feed is therefore already considered in the above data. Consequently, the use of vitamin C in animal nutrition is not of concern for consumer safety. In the absence of inhalation toxicity studies it would be prudent to assume that inhalation of dust from the additives presents a health hazard to workers. Sodium calcium ascorbyl phosphate is not an irritant to skin and eyes and is unlikely to be a skin sensitiser. This conclusion is extrapolated to sodium ascorbyl phosphate. In the absence of data, ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbate, calcium ascorbate and <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> should be considered as irritant to skin and eyes and as dermal sensitisers. The supplementation of feed with vitamin C does not pose a risk to the environment. Ascorbic acid, sodium calcium ascorbyl phosphate and sodium ascorbyl phosphate are regarded as effective sources of vitamin C when added to feed or water for drinking. Since ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbate, calcium ascorbate and <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> are authorised for use as antioxidants in food and their function in feed {{is essential}}ly the same as that in food, no further demonstration of efficacy is considered necessary...|$|E

40|$|The frying {{shelf life}} of {{commercial}} frying oil was increased {{by the addition}} of synthetic and natural antioxidants, e. g.

The results revealed that TBHQ had the best effect in retarding the deteriorative effect of frying conditions throughout 24 h of frying potato chips at 180 ± 10 ºC followed by the effect of retinyl palmitate and the effect of <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> compared to the control without any additives. Fried potato chips in oils either with or without antioxidant were collected during the first 8 h of frying, divided into 3 main portions each portion had different treatment; 1) without any additives (control samples for fried potatoes resulting from the control oil or from oil containing TBHQ or containing retinyl or <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>palmitate.</b> 2) fortification of the above 4 samples with vitamin E (tocopherol) by dipping each of the resulting samples from the four frying trials separately in oil containing 0. 1 % tocopherol. 3) fortification of each of the above mentioned samples with vitamin C by dispersing the mixture of fine salt and <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> on the fried chips' surface and vigorous shaking in bags. The control samples and fortified samples were packed in aluminum bags and stored in an electric oven at 63 ± 1 ºC. The storage ability of fried potatoes at 63 ± 1 ºC was increased by the fortification with antioxidant vitamins either with vitamin E (tocopherol) or with vitamin C (<b>ascorbyl</b> <b>palmitate)</b> before packaging and storing at 63 ± 1 ºC. The results indicated that potatoes fried in oil without any additives (control) had the lowest storage stability and that it was increased by the fortification with antioxidant vitamins, C or E. Potato chips fortified with vitamins A or C by frying in oil containing retinyl palmitate or <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> and also in oil containing TBHQ had better storage ability at 63 ºC and this was also prolonged {{by the addition of}} vitamin E or C after the frying processes and before storing at 63 ºC in aluminium bags. This demonstrated the synergistic effect of the antioxidant vitamins which work either alone or complementary to each other along with the protective effect of the phenolic antioxidant (TBHQ) which protected these vitamins by supporting their antioxidant function. Mediante la adición de antioxidantes sintéticos y naturales, como TBHQ, retinil palmitato y ascorbil palmitato, es posible aumentar la estabilidad de aceites para la fritura comercial. Los resultados indican que TBHQ, seguido de retinil palmitato y ascorbil palmitato, en este orden, es el mejor para retrasar el deterioro de las condiciones para la fritura, 24 h a 180 °C, de patatas fritas cuando se compara con un control sin aditivos. Se tomaron muestras de patatas fritas en aceites con y sin vitaminas antioxidantes durante las primeras 8 horas de fritura, y se dividieron en tres porciones para someterlas a diferentes tratamientos: 1) sin aditivos (muestras control de patatas fritas con aceite control o con aceite que contenía TBHQ, retinil palmitato o ascorbil palmitato; 2) enriquecimiento de las cuatro muestras anteriores con vitamina E (tocoferol) mediante la inmersión de las patatas fritas en aceite con 0, 1 % tocoferol; y 3) enriquecimiento de las muestras anteriores con vitamina C mediante la dispersión de una mezcla de sal fina y ascorbil palmitato sobre la superficie de las patatas fritas y agitación de las mismas en el interior de paquetes. Las muestras controles y enriquecidas se empaquetaron en paquetes de aluminio y fueron guardadas en un horno eléctrico a 63 ± 1 ºC. La estabilidad de las patatas fritas a 63 ± 1 ºC aumentó en presencia de vitamina E y de vitamina C antes del empaquetamiento y almacenamiento a esa temperatura. Las patatas fritas con aceite enriquecido en vitaminas A, C y TBHQ fueron las que mejor se conservaron a 63 ºC; este efecto se prolongó mediante la adición de vitaminas E ó C después del proceso de fritura y antes de su almacenamiento a 63 ºC en paquetes de aluminio.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} four commercially available antioxidants in two fish oils. The antioxidants were investigated to see which one of them is most efficient in preventing oxidation. Antioxidants were added in three levels to find the optimal concentration. In addition a possible synergistic effect between the antioxidants was investigated. Two different oils with different concentration of EPA and DHA were added antioxidants. Four of the antioxidants were single antioxidants. Two mixes with two antioxidants were added to investigate possible synergistic effect. The antioxidants were added in three different concentrations. The oils were stored at two different temperatures with access to oxygen. Peroxide value (PV), anisidine value (AV) and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) were methods used to evaluate extent of oxidation. Total oxidation value (TOTOX) was calculated based on PV and AV measurements. Gas chromatography was used to identify and quantify 14 selected volatile organic compounds (VOC) used to describe extent of oxidation. In addition the fatty acid profiles of the two oils were analyzed by gas chromatography. The storage temperature and type of oil showed to have significant effect on TOTOX. These two factors also influenced the concentration of VOC in the oil samples. The three levels of antioxidants showed no significant effect on TOTOX. Only the middle level of antioxidant was used when analyzing VOC. <b>Ascorbyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> and propyl gallate distinguished from the rest of the antioxidants. Oil with <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> showed great variation and high values for PV and AV. Some of the oil samples with <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> gave higher areas for specific VOC compared to reference samples without antioxidant. <b>Ascorbyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> distinguished as the least efficient antioxidant with regard to specific VOCs. Oil with propyl gallate showed less variation and lower PV and AV than the other antioxidants. Samples with propyl gallate distinguished from the other oil samples, including reference samples, with regard to VOC. Mixed tocopherol, either as single antioxidant or in mix with rosemary extract, also distinguished with regard to VOC. The reference samples were stored under the same conditions and were not added antioxidants. These samples were not significantly different from the other samples with antioxidants added with regard to PV and AV. A possible prooxidative effect was seen for some of the antioxidants. Total area of VOC, on the other hand, revealed higher areas for most of the reference samples. Evaluation of VOC revealed antioxidative effect of all the antioxidants, in more or less degree. The efficiency of the antioxidants applied in this study depended on type of oil and storage temperature.

Blank and iron (Fe) loaded nanocarriers were prepared by a modified thin film method using <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> and DSPE-PEG. Surface charge of the nanocarriers was modified by the inclusion of chitosan (CHI) during the formulation process. Blank and iron loaded ascorbyl palmitate/DSPE nanocarriers were visualised by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and physiochemical characterisations of the nanocarriers carried out to determine the mean particle size and zeta potential. Inclusion of chitosan imparted a net positive charge on the nanocarrier surface and also led to an increase in mean particle size. Iron entrapment in ascorbyl palmitate-Fe and ascorbyl palmitate-CHI-Fe nanocarriers was 67 % and 76 % respectively, suggesting a beneficial effect of chitosan on nanocarrier Fe entrapment.

From the results obtained, it was verified that the antioxidants coriander extract, <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> and the mixture of these antioxidants, when added to sunflower oil, showed the ability to retard the formation of peroxides 16. 4, 77. 5 and 84. 0 % and conjugated dienes 11. 2, 56. 9 and 60. 9 %, respectively. The antioxidant mixture presented a higher antioxidant potential in sunflower oil than the antioxidants applied alone, which proved the synergistic effect of the antoxidants studied...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe release {{study of}} natural antioxidants, i. e., <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> and α-tocopherol, and {{synthetic}} phenolic antioxidants including butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, and tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) from polylactic acid (PLA) film into food simulants were accomplished. PLA antioxidant films {{were placed in}} contact with 95, 50, and 10  % ethanol at 40 and 20  °C. Released antioxidants were regularly measured by high-performance liquid chromatography system for 60  days. <b>Ascorbyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> was completely degraded during film preparation {{and is not a}} suitable antioxidant for PLA antioxidant-active packaging. The diffusion coefficient (D) and partition coefficient (K) of antioxidants were calculated based on obtained data. Diffusion of the antioxidants from PLA to the simulants showed a Fick's behavior with the diffusion coefficient (D) value between 10 − 9 and 10 − 11  cm 2  s− 1 with 0 ― 100  % of release. Faster and higher release of antioxidants occurred at 40  °C according to Arrhenius law. At 40  °C, TBHQ in 95  % ethanol decomposed to 2 -tert-butyl- 1, 4 -benzoquinone and other quinone derivatives, and α-tocopherol in 50  % ethanol decomposed to some unknown neoformed compounds. Antioxidants molecular weight, Log P, simulant polarity, and temperature were the most influencing factors on antioxidants release rate from PLA films in contact with food simulants. The D and K coefficients of studied antioxidants from PLA in three food simulants and two temperatures can be used to create PLA antioxidant-active packaging to continually control the oxidation reactions in diverse foodstuffs to ensure higher food qualities. The PLA antioxidant-active packaging approach also permits to reduce the amounts of directly added antioxidants in foods to provide safer foods...|$|E
40|$|Drug {{nanoparticle}} formulation using {{ascorbic acid}} derivatives and its therapeutic uses {{have recently been}} introduced. Hydrophilic ascorbic acid derivatives such as ascorbyl glycoside have been used not only as antioxidants but also as food and pharmaceutical excipients. In addition to drug solubilization, drug nanoparticle formation was observed using ascorbyl glycoside. Hydrophobic ascorbic acid derivatives such as ascorbyl mono- and di-n-alkyl fatty acid derivatives are used either as drugs or carrier components. Ascorbyl n-alkyl fatty acid derivatives have been formulated as antioxidants or anticancer drugs for nanoparticle formulations such as micelles, microemulsions, and liposomes. ASC-P vesicles called aspasomes are submicron-sized particles that can encapsulate hydrophilic drugs. Several transdermal and injectable formulations of ascorbyl n-alkyl fatty acid derivatives were used, including <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>palmitate...</b>|$|E
40|$|Oil-in-water {{emulsions}} {{were prepared}} with 30 % stripped sunflower oil, stabilized by 20 g/L BSA and homogenized under high pressure {{to obtain a}} mean droplet size near 0. 5 mum. The emulsions were shown to be physically stable during storage in a shaker at 47 degreesC for 5 d. Such a medium was suitable to test the efficiency {{of different types of}} antioxidants. Oxidation of control emulsions appeared rapidly without a lag phase, and the contents of conjugated dienes and hexanal reached a plateau after around 20 h. in the presence of EDTA, the oxidation was strongly inhibited, suggesting that some metallic ions present in the oil or the protein solution act as inducers. Ascorbic acid and <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> were inactive. Isoeugenol was found to be a powerful antioxidant, better than eugenol, alpha-tocopherol, and Trolox...|$|E
40|$|In 1993, the NutraSweet company {{introduced}} a commercial low cholesterol dried yolk product that used {{supercritical carbon dioxide}} extraction (SCCO 2) technology. Although, the company decided to terminate production of the product in 1996, the potential to commercialize the product still exists. Due to the high cholesterol and lipid content in the egg yolk, oxidation is highly possible during the extraction process. The overall objective is to test {{the effects of the}} SCCO 2 extraction process on cholesterol and lipid oxidation, and to identify changes in lipid and phospholipid components of spray dried egg yolk during the process. In addition, this study will evaluate the effectiveness of different antioxidants during SCCO 2 extraction.
