Phasic alerting was expected to increase the conflict, whereas tonic alerting was expected to decrease the conflict. Three experiments were conducted using different variants of the flanker task with visual alerting cues and varied cue-target intervals (SOA), to differentiate between effects of phasic alerting (short SOA) and tonic alerting (long SOA). The results showed that phasic alerting consistently decreased the efficiency of conflict resolution indexed by response time and accuracy, whereas tonic alerting increased the accuracy of conflict resolution, but at a cost in the speed of processing the conflict. The third experiment additionally showed {{that the effects of}} phasic alerting may be modulated by the psychophysical strength of alerting cues. Discussed are possible mechanisms that could account for the observed interactions between alerting and conflict resolution, as well as some discrepancies between the current and previous studies...|$|R

40|$|Background Drug-drug {{interactions}} (DDIs) {{are very}} prevalent in hospitalized patients. Objectives To {{determine the number}} of DDI alerts, time saved, and time invested after suppressing clinically irrelevant alerts and adding clinical-decision support to relevant alerts. Materials and methods The most frequently occurring DDIs were evaluated for clinical relevance by a multidisciplinary expert panel. Pharmacist evaluation of relevant DDIs was facilitated using computerized decision support systems (CDSS). During Phase 1, only CDSS-assisted DDI checking was implemented. During Phase 2, CDSS-assisted DDI checking remained in place, and clinically irrelevant DDIs were suppressed. In each phase, the number of alerts and duration of pharmacist DDI checking were compared to conventional DDI checking. In addition, the time invested to implement and configure the CDSS was compared to the time saved using CDSS-assisted DDI checking. Results CDSS-assisted DDI checking resulted in a daily decrease of DDI checking alerts from 65 to 47 <b>alerts</b> in <b>Phase</b> 1 (P=. 03) and from 73 to 33 <b>alerts</b> in <b>Phase</b> 2 (P=. 003). DDI checking duration decreased from 15 to 11 minutes (P=. 044) and from 15 1 / 2 to 8 1 / 2 minutes (P=. 001) in Phases 1 and 2, respectively. Almost 298 of the 392 hours required for implementation were invested by pharmacists. An annual timesaving of 30 hours yielded a return on investment of 9. 8 years. Conclusion CDSS-assisted DDI checking resulted in a 55 % reduction of the number of alerts and a 45 % reduction in time spent on DDI checking, yielding a return on investment of almost 10 years. Our approach can be used to refine other drug safety checking modules, increasing the efficiency of checking for drug safety without the need to add more staff pharmacists...|$|R

50|$|Metal Gear 2 builds {{upon the}} stealth-based {{gameplay}} system of its predecessor. As {{in the original}} Metal Gear, the players objective is to infiltrate the enemys stronghold, while avoiding detection from soldiers, cameras, infrared sensors and other surveillance devices. The biggest change in the game was done to the enemys abilities. Instead of remaining stationed in one screen like in the first game, enemy soldiers can now patrol different screens across a single map. Moreover, guards now have an expanded field of vision of 45 degrees, along {{with the ability to}} turn their heads left or right to see diagonally. The enemy can also hear any noise made by the player, such as a punch to the wall or gunshots made without a suppressor, and will investigate the source of the sound once it is made. If the player is discovered by the enemy, then a counter will be displayed on the upper right side of the screen that will go down after the enemy has lost track of the player. When the counter reaches zero, the <b>alert</b> <b>phase</b> will go off and the game will return to normal.|$|E
50|$|The {{player is}} given {{a variety of new}} {{maneuvers}} and tools to help them remain undetected and complete the game. For example, the player can now kneel and crawl in addition to walking, allowing the player to avoid making noise over certain terrains, pick up land mines, and hide in tight spaces such as under desks or inside air ducts. A radar with a 3x3 grid on the upper right of the screen shows the players current area in the center grid (as a red dot), with enemy soldiers as white dots, allowing the player to determine whats ahead. However, the radar is disabled when the game enters <b>alert</b> <b>phase.</b> The radar can also be used with the mine detector equipped to determine the locations of enemy mines or launch Stinger missiles onto an airborne target. Many of the weapons and equipment from the first game are brought over along with new items such as robotic mice used to distract enemies, a camouflaged mat and three different types of rations with special attributes each. Health and carrying capacity is increased each time a boss is defeated.|$|E

During certain stages, the player is given a special challenge such as reaching the goal without being seen or survive an <b>alert</b> <b>phase</b> for a certain period. After clearing a special challenge, the player is allowed to sort his team and replace any of its members and gear with soldiers or items procured in previous stages. The player is also given a choice to suspend their game and resume from where they left off at a later time. If the player successfully complete every stage in Infinity Mission or uses a Fulton balloon to escape, they will retain every soldier, item and experience points acquired since the mission started (conversely, any item or soldier lost during the mission will be permanently lost as well). However, if the player fails or aborts the mission, the player's squad will be set to the way it was before the mission began (undoing any deaths that occurred as well).|$|E

5000|$|Another {{big change}} {{made to the}} game was in the level designs. Instead of the {{underwater}} infiltration from the original version, the game starts with Solid Snake parachuting {{into the middle of}} a jungle alongside three other soldiers (who are never seen nor mentioned outside of the intro). After landing in the jungle, the player must reach a transport truck at the end that will take Snake to the entrance of the first building. The player can also use other transport trucks to reach the entrances of the other buildings quicker since they travel in a cyclical pattern. The basement floors of Building 1 and 2 in the MSX2 version were made into separate buildings, Building 4 and 5 respectively, which are only reachable by going through one of two jungle mazes located in the outdoor areas between the other three buildings. The correct path to take in the jungle maze is never revealed in the game. In addition to the removal of the Metal Gear tank, the Hind D boss on the rooftop of Building 1 was also replaced by a pair of armed turret gunners called [...] "Twin Shot". The NES version also lacks the higher <b>alert</b> <b>phase</b> from the MSX2 version and the jet pack-wearing soldiers on the rooftops of Building 1 and 2 lost their ability to fly (making them act more like regular guards).
