25|$|Re-localization of {{manufacturing}} infrastructure by multinational corporations (MNCs) to low-cost countries {{has led to}} de-industrialisation. The reduction of human intervention through automation of production and logistics processes has reduced employment opportunities. Differing taxation regimes within the European Union have led to aggressive tax optimization and avoidance by conglomerates and small and medium-sized enterprises. Favourable commercial tax credit agreements and the rampant misuse of special purpose entity (SPE) based in certain EU28 member States (UK, Ireland, Netherlands, Luxemburg & Belgium) have allowed large corporations to avoid, minimise or indefinitely defer tax dues. Populist movements all over the European Union have campaigned for policies which target loopholes allowing tax avoidance by transnational corporations and scrutinize incentives and subsidies given to factories where automation {{of manufacturing}} processes has improved productivity and enriched share-holders but diminished job prospects for non-specialized workers. Governments {{have been slow to}} move away from neoliberal policies and <b>adopt</b> <b>measures</b> which advance the public good of local communities through public-private initiatives which nurture grass-roots innovation, promote social partnering entrepreneurship and sustain job creation in self-employing SMEs.|$|E
500|$|Periyar wanted {{thinking}} {{people to}} see their society as far from perfect and in urgent need of reform. He wanted the government, the political parties and social workers to identify the evils in society and boldly <b>adopt</b> <b>measures</b> to remove them. Periyar's philosophy did not differentiate social and political service. According to him, the first duty of a government is to run the social organisation efficiently, and the philosophy of religion was to organise the social system. Periyar stated that while Christian and Islamic religions were fulfilling this role, the Hindu religion remained totally unsuitable for social progress. He argued {{that the government was}} not for the people, but, in a [...] "topsy-turvy" [...] manner, the people were for the government. He attributed this situation to the state of the social system contrived for the advantage {{of a small group of}} people.|$|E

2500|$|Probiotics {{are defined}} as {{microorganisms}} that are believed to provide health benefits when consumed. The term probiotic is currently used to name ingested microorganisms associated with benefits for humans and animals. The term came into more common use after 1980. The introduction of the concept (but not the term) is generally attributed to Nobel laureate Élie Metchnikoff, who postulated that yogurt-consuming Bulgarian peasants lived longer lives because of this custom. He suggested in 1907 that [...] "the dependence of the intestinal microbes on the food {{makes it possible to}} <b>adopt</b> <b>measures</b> to modify the flora in our bodies and to replace the harmful microbes by useful microbes". A significant expansion of the potential market for probiotics has led to higher requirements for scientific substantiation of putative benefits conferred by the microorganisms.|$|E
