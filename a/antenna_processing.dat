To this end, we consider a realistic performance metric {{that takes into account}} both the <b>antenna</b> <b>processing</b> gain and RS transmission overhead. Using the metric, we formulate an integer programming (IP) problem that determines the best RRH subset leading to maximum network capacity. To the best of our knowledge, the trade-off between the <b>antenna</b> <b>processing</b> gain and RS overhead has never been comprehensively considered for network capacity maximization in the literature of C-RAN control.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of new outdoor millimeter-wave channel models requires processing of the experimental data {{which can be used}} to estimate multipath channel parameters with very high time and angular resolution. The virtual <b>antenna</b> arrays <b>processing</b> technique allows joint narrow beam forming and beam steering. The specific of outdoor experiment does not allow precise positioning of the antennas, like it possible under lab-conditions. So some special methodology should be developed to overcome this problem. In this paper we propose the virtual <b>antenna</b> array signal <b>processing</b> which allows for given experimental data to perform environment scanning with equivalent 1 degrees antenna beamwidth and - 30 dB sidelobes rejection. As a result, the measurement environment was accurately reconstructed on the base of measurement data.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{performance}} of <b>antenna</b> array <b>processing</b> in distributed multiple access networks without power control. The interference is represented as a Poisson point process. Desired and interfering signals are subject to both path-loss fading (with an exponent greater than 2) and to independent Rayleigh fading. Using these assumptions, we derive the exact closed form expression for the cumulative distribution function of the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio when optimum combining is applied. This results in a pertinent measure of the network performance {{in terms of the}} outage probability, which in turn provides insights into the network capacity gain that could be achieved with <b>antenna</b> array <b>processing.</b> We present and discuss examples of applications, as well as some numerical results.

30|$|As more antennas {{participate}} in cooperative transmission, the <b>antenna</b> <b>processing</b> gain increases while RS transmission consumes a larger fraction {{of time and}} frequency resources, which otherwise would be dedicated for data transmission. Considering the trade-off relationship, we need to investigate the impact of RS transmission overhead on the network capacity of an FDD-based C-RAN in which {{a large number of}} antennas are scattered for user service. We then also need to find the best subset of RRHs that maximize the network capacity considering both the <b>antenna</b> <b>processing</b> gain and RS transmission overhead.|$|E

30|$|The above {{reasoning}} {{implies that}} C̅ is maximized {{with the best}} subset of RRHs balancing the <b>antenna</b> <b>processing</b> gain and RS overhead, i.e., finding the optimal solution of (11) leads to network capacity maximization in consideration of the <b>antenna</b> <b>processing</b> gain and RS overhead. If we increase the transmission power per spatial stream, P in (10), the log terms in (10) reaches the saturation region more quickly with selection of more RRHs. Therefore, as the network allocates more power for user services, the optimal RRH subset of (11) consists of {{a smaller number of}} RRHs, which leads to RS transmission consuming a smaller potion of time and frequency resources.|$|E
40|$|Signal <b>processing</b> <b>antennas</b> {{have been}} studied not only for {{interference}} suppression but also for high-resolution estimation of radio environment such as directions-of-arrival of incident signals.

Examining the eigenvector beam patterns, we demonstrate that the high-resolution capability is realized by steering nulls. The considerations will be useful for understanding the high-resolution techniques in the signal <b>processing</b> <b>antennas.</b> We then describe a modified version of MUSIC (Root MUSIC).

40|$|Synthetic Aperture Radar / Ground Moving Target Indication (SAR / GMTI) is {{an active}} radar remote sensing technique, based on the {{coherent}} combination of SAR imaging and <b>antenna</b> array <b>processing.</b> The SAR / GMTI technique provided a step forward in quantitative ground motion parameter estimation. In the last two decades, airborne SAR / GMTI experiments, {{and in the last}} years also spaceborne SAR / GMTI experiments evaluated the potential of the SAR / GMTI techniques to estimate ground motion parameters (i. e. target position, velocity, and motion direction). This dissertation addresses the actual status, the potentials and limitations of spaceborne SAR / GMTI with single / monostatic platforms carrying two-dimensional antenna arrays. The SAR processing is applied in order to generate high resolution images of the target signals, <b>antenna</b> array <b>processing</b> in along-track direction is applied for GMTI and <b>antenna</b> array <b>processing</b> in across-track direction in order to cover large swathes. This trade-off between SAR imaging capability, GMTI capability and swath coverage requires a careful design of radar systems and operation modes. Therefore, one main goal of this dissertation is to provide new spaceborne radar system designs and operation modes which provide a good trade-off between GMTI capability and swath coverage, and furthermore a high flexibility in adjusting between SAR capability and GMTI capability. One considered future SAR system is Astrium’s High Resolution Wide Swath Reference System. Another system is a radar design which is characterized mainly by a largely increased beamsteering capability. Besides, one secondary objective of this dissertation were to extend the signal modeling for combining SAR imaging and <b>antenna</b> array <b>processing</b> in spaceborne geometries. Another secondary objective was to calibrate the first available spaceborne SAR / along-track array experimental data, namely the data from the TerraSAR-X dual receive antenna mode.

40|$|In this paper, {{the degrees}} of freedom (DoF) regions of {{constant}} coefficient multiple antenna interference channels are investigated. First, we consider a K-user Gaussian interference channel with M_k antennas at transmitter k, 1 < k< K, and N_j antennas at receiver j, 1 < j< K, denoted as a (K,[M_k],[N_j]) channel. Relying on a result of simultaneous Diophantine approximation, a real interference alignment scheme with joint receive <b>antenna</b> <b>processing</b> is developed. The scheme is used to obtain an achievable DoF region. The proposed DoF region includes two previously known results as special cases, namely 1) the total DoF of a K-user interference channel with N antennas at each node, (K, [N], [N]) channel, is NK/ 2; and 2) the total DoF of a (K, [M], [N]) channel is at least KMN/(M+N). We next explore constant-coefficient interference networks with K transmitters and J receivers, all having N antennas. Each transmitter emits an independent message and each receiver requests an arbitrary subset of the messages. Employing the novel joint receive <b>antenna</b> <b>processing,</b> the DoF region for this set-up is obtained. We finally consider wireless X networks where each node is allowed to have an arbitrary number of antennas. It is shown that the joint receive <b>antenna</b> <b>processing</b> {{can be used to}} establish an achievable DoF region, which is larger than what is possible with antenna splitting. As a special case of the derived achievable DoF region for constant coefficient X network, the total DoF of wireless X networks with the same number of antennas at all nodes and with joint <b>antenna</b> <b>processing</b> is tight while the best inner bound based on antenna splitting cannot meet the outer bound. Finally, we obtain a DoF region outer bound based on the technique of transmitter grouping. Comment: 27 pages, 2 figures. This paper was accepted in part to the ISIT 201...|$|E
30|$|In this paper, we have {{developed}} an RRH control scheme for FDD-based C-RANs which maximizes the network capacity by adaptively determining a cooperating RRH subset in consideration of both the <b>antenna</b> <b>processing</b> gain and RS overhead. Our main contribution is introducing a realistic performance metric {{that takes into account}} both <b>antenna</b> <b>processing</b> gain and RS transmission overhead, which then leads to formulation of a network capacity maximization problem. This has never been studied in the literature. Simulation results have revealed that larger number of antennas do not always guarantee network capacity increase in FDD-based C-RANs. The proposed algorithm adaptively finds the best RRH subset for cooperation and offers a significant improvement on the network capacity. For future research directions, the proposed RRH control may be extended to incorporate transmit power control and uplink CSI overhead.|$|E
