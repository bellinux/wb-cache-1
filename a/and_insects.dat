5|$|Animals, often mammals but {{including}} fish <b>and</b> <b>insects</b> {{among other}} groups, {{have been the}} subjects of art from the earliest times, both historical, as in Ancient Egypt, and prehistoric, as in the cave paintings at Lascaux and other sites in the Dordogne, France and elsewhere.

5|$|Besides its prairie restorations {{and bodies}} of water, Silver Springs has areas of {{deciduous}} forests, and wetlands, {{both of which}} are populated with species of mammals, birds <b>and</b> <b>insects.</b> Bird life observed in the park includes: osprey, great horned owl, eastern screech owl and long-eared owl; bald eagle have been sighted further upstream along the Fox. Reptiles and amphibians are present in the park but are more elusive than other types of animal life.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{prefer to}} eat seeds, tubers, corms, fruit, flowers <b>and</b> <b>insects.</b> They often feed in large flocks, {{particularly}} when ground-feeding. Cockatoos are monogamous and nest in tree hollows.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to state reptiles, state birds {{have been more}} rapidly adopted, with the first state designating one in 1927 and the fiftieth in 1973. As of January 2011, other types of animals more popular for state symbolization were mammals (46), fish (45), <b>and</b> <b>insects</b> (42). Animal symbols less popular than reptiles were butterflies (17), amphibians (17), dogs (11), dinosaurs (5), bats (3), and crustaceans (3).|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Environmental Sciences)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Surveys {{of plant}} <b>and</b> {{selected}} <b>insect</b> species {{was conducted in}} Highveld and Lowveld agro–ecosystems of four provinces of South Africa, namely North–West, Mpumalanga, KwaZulu–Natal and Limpopo. The objectives {{of the study were}} to compare <b>insect</b> <b>and</b> plant diversity between localities (grassland and savanna) and treatments (maize field, semi–transformed and untransformed) to test for a general relationship between plant <b>and</b> <b>insect</b> diversity along a maize field–field margin gradient. Plant <b>and</b> <b>insect</b> diversity patterns were studied along the gradient and quantified in terms of richness and diversity indices. Plant <b>and</b> <b>insect</b> species compositional turnover was also measured along the maize field–field margin gradient. Plant diversity increased with increasing distance from maize fields into the margin. The flora in maize fields and of margins differed, but in contrast, insect species assemblages were similar in maize fields and margins. There was no statistical difference in insect diversity between treatments (maize field, semi–transformed and transformed). A relationship was revealed between plant <b>and</b> <b>insect</b> diversity, as plant diversity enhanced insect diversity. Master...|$|R

5|$|Like {{the giant}} panda, they cannot digest cellulose, {{so they must}} consume a large volume of bamboo to survive. Their diets consist of about two-thirds bamboo, but they also eat mushrooms, roots, acorns, lichens, and grasses. Occasionally, they {{supplement}} their diets with fish <b>and</b> <b>insects.</b> They {{do little more than}} eat and sleep due to their low-calorie diets.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{materials}} {{found in}} the environment also induce plant resistance as well. Chitosan derived from chitin induce a plant's natural defense response against pathogens, diseases <b>and</b> <b>insects</b> including cyst nematodes, both are approved as biopesticides by the EPA to reduce the dependence on toxic pesticides.|$|E
5|$|Numerous nectar-feeding {{insects are}} {{attracted}} to the flower spikes, which in turn attract honeyeaters, silvereyes and sunbirds, many of which consume both nectar <b>and</b> <b>insects.</b> The sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) forages among the flower spikes and is a probable pollinator. The common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis) feeds on nectar. B.dentata has been recorded as a host plant for the mistletoe species Amyema benthamii, Decaisnina angustata and D.signata.|$|E

5|$|Six {{species of}} honeyeater have been {{observed}} feeding at its flowers, as have insects including honeybees, ants, butterflies, beetles and native bees. Both birds <b>and</b> <b>insects</b> function as pollinators, but honeybees are probably not very effective: in one study only about 4% of honeybees collected pollen, and they tended to move from inflorescence to inflorescence on the same plant, rather than moving between plants.|$|E
5|$|Some birds <b>and</b> <b>insects</b> use {{defensive}} regurgitation to {{ward off}} predators. The northern fulmar vomits a bright orange, oily substance called stomach oil when threatened. The stomach oil is made from their aquatic diets. It causes the predator's feathers to mat, leading {{to the loss of}} flying ability and the loss of water repellency. This is especially dangerous for aquatic birds because their water repellent feathers protect them from hypothermia when diving for food.|$|E
5|$|The {{black stork}} mainly eats fish, {{including}} small cyprinids, pikes, roaches, eels, budds, perches, burbots, sicklebacks and muddy loaches (Misgurnus and Cobitis).

Young birds and eggs are taken opportunistically and rarely, but can include black turnstones, lapland longspurs and even the eggs of other Sabine's gulls <b>and</b> geese. <b>Insects</b> <b>and</b> <b>insect</b> larvae taken include terrestrial and aquatic beetles, springtails, craneflies, mosquitos, midges, and flower flies (Syrphidae).|$|R
