5|$|In this episode, flashbacks {{depict the}} story behind Claire's pregnancy. Rejected by her boyfriend when he refused to raise their child, Claire decides to go to <b>an</b> <b>adoption</b> agency out of a belief that she will {{struggle}} to raise it alone. Claire visits a psychic (Nick Jameson) who warns her of a dangerous future for her unborn child if she does not raise it. In the present, Claire experiences terrifying nightmares and begins to suspect that somebody is trying to harm her unborn child. In response, Hurley (Jorge Garcia) decides to start a census {{of all of the}} survivors.|$|E
5|$|It may be {{submitted}} that such judicial {{deference to the}} executive results in a clear neglect of the enshrined fundamental liberties in the Constitution. The flip side to this criticism is that fundamental liberties may still be given due accord though other avenues, for example, the application of rules of natural justice. As the meaning accorded to a particular fundamental liberty may be a potential ground for overturning Parliamentary legislation, {{it is crucial that}} the court should not merely rely on international law to determine the meaning of the liberty, unless there is evidence that the executive considers there is indeed <b>an</b> <b>adoption</b> of the particular international law norm.|$|E
5|$|Becky confronts Kylie after a bad {{reference}} {{that she}} provided to <b>an</b> <b>adoption</b> agency. At first Kylie pretends {{that she has}} a privileged life in order to impress Becky but it soon emerges that she is on the streets. She then moves into the Rovers Return Inn and instantaneously sparks a conflict with Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh). Becky and Steve soon discover {{that she has a}} four-year-old son called Max, whose custody she seeks. She sells Steve's motorbike and tries to sleep with him. After visiting Max at the foster parents' home, she takes him home. She sleeps with Gary Windass (Mikey North). Kylie is awarded custody of her son. Later she steals money from the till at Roy's Rolls, and jets off to Cyprus on holiday and leaves Max in Becky's care. She returns {{a couple of weeks later}} with a new boyfriend, Demetri. She tells Becky that she has come back to take Max to live in Cyprus, leaving Becky heartbroken. Kylie sees Becky's desperation as she cannot have children and offers to give Max to her in exchange for 20,000 pounds. Becky complies and Kylie leaves.|$|E

5|$|Diablo Cody {{was first}} {{approached}} {{to write a}} screenplay by film producer Mason Novick, who had previously landed her a book deal for her memoir, , after discovering her blog about stripping. He persuaded her to adapt the book for the screen, but suggested that she first write a screenwriting sample to show studios; that sample became Juno. After deciding on <b>an</b> <b>adoption</b> storyline, Cody collected the stories of adoptees, birth parents and adoptive parents, including that of her then-husband, an adoptee who reunited with his birth parents after she wrote the film. She also found inspiration {{in the story of}} a close friend who had become pregnant in high school and used some details from her friend's experience in the film, such as mistreatment from an ultrasound technician. Much of Juno, however, was based on Cody's own high school experiences: She dated a tic-tac-loving boy similar to Paulie, she was best friends with a cheerleader like Leah, and she used a hamburger phone identical to the one that appears in the film. After writing the screenplay over seven weeks in the Starbucks section of a Target store in Crystal, Minnesota, Cody compared writing to breathing, seeing Juno as an extension of herself.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{similarities}} between the Hellenistic wall paintings at Delos and the First Style of Pompeii, Joyce contends that the differences in Delian and Pompeian mosaics are the deliberate product of artistic preference rather than the result of ignorance of each other's traditions. These differences include the widespread use of opus signinum at Pompeii, with only four known examples at Delos; the use of opus sectile at Pompeii and its complete absence at Delos; the prevalent use of polychrome patterns and intricate, three-dimensional figured designs in Delian mosaics versus two-dimensional designs at Pompeii, which at best utilize two colors. Complex three-dimensional figured mosaics using polychrome designs to achieve the illusion of light and shadow weren't produced at Pompeii until the Pompeian Second Style of wall painting (80-20 BC) and are considered <b>an</b> <b>adoption</b> from Hellenistic art trends. While lead strips were used in Hellenistic mosaics of Delos, Athens, and Pella (Greece), Pergamon (Turkey), Callatis (Romania), Alexandria (Egypt), and Chersonesus (the Crimean peninsula), they are absent in Western Mediterranean mosaics of Malta, Sicily, and the Italian peninsula. Westgate affirms that Hellenistic mosaics can be divided into two broad categories: eastern and western, based on their different styles and production techniques.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the recent}} {{phenomena}} information systems (IS) practitioners are currently facing in their continuous process of adopting new technology is the utilization of Extensible Markup Language (XML). In this paper we propose <b>an</b> XML <b>adoption</b> framework, <b>a</b> corresponding <b>adoption</b> space model, and a probit model of technology diffusion to examine the decision of adopting XML-based applications {{in the context of}} electronic business. First, <b>an</b> XML <b>adoption</b> framework is proposed. The framework helps companies examine their current status in the electronic business environment from the perspective of three electronic business domains, namely enterprise intranets, value-chain extranets, and the global Internet. This framework also provides guidelines for companies seeking to understand the potential benefits of adopting XML technology, and then further suggests the appropriate path and proper applications. Second, we propose <b>an</b> XML <b>adoption</b> space model. Considering its current status of IT applications, a company can utilize this model to measure the efforts/costs that will be incurred by developing XML-enabled IT applications. Third, we use a probit model of technology diffusion to explore the feasibility of <b>a</b> company's <b>adoption</b> of XML technology. This probit model considers a company's specific characteristics and evaluates benefits and efforts/costs of its XML adoption decision. Keywords: E-Business, Decision Model, Framework, XML 1...|$|R

25|$|While {{it is true}} {{that there}} is often no {{statutory}} maximum age limit to perform <b>an</b> <b>adoption,</b> and adopted children are often treated the same as natural children, so an 86-year-old woman who adopts a newborn child is legally in the same position as an 86-year-old woman who gives birth, the fertile octogenarian rule predates the laws allowing legal adoption.|$|E

25|$|Unlike Helios/Sol, who {{was part}} of the {{traditional}} state-sponsored Roman religious system, and also unlike the Sol Invictus cult, which became an official state-sponsored cult in 274 under Aurelian, the Mithraic cult (as all other mystery cults) did not receive state sanction.
