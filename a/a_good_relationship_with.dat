His force's priority, he said, was to maintain <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> the Polícia Judiciária with a view to finding Madeleine.|$|E
5|$|Sarah's {{relationship}} with her children was strained. Although she had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> her daughter, Anne Spencer, she became estranged from her daughters Henrietta, Elizabeth and Mary. Similarly heartbroken when her favourite daughter Anne died in 1716, Sarah kept her favourite cup, a lock of her hair, and adopted the Sunderlands' youngest child, Lady Diana, who would later become her favourite granddaughter.|$|E
5|$|Although historians {{differ in}} their {{opinions}} about his relationship, if any, to Kings Edgar the Peaceable and Edward the Martyr, it is generally thought that he enjoyed <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> King Æthelred II. His daughter Ælfgifu married Æthelred. Thored was ealdorman in Northumbria {{for much of his}} reign, disappearing from the sources in 992 after being appointed by Æthelred to lead an expedition against the Vikings.|$|E

5|$|Before he {{was elected}} king of the Commonwealth, Władysław fought in many campaigns, seeking {{personal}} glory. After his final campaign against Russians in 1617–1618 (the end of Dymitriads), in 1619 he went to Silesia, looking {{for an opportunity to}} aid the Habsburgs in their struggle against the Czech Hussites in the Thirty Years' War. That opportunity never came, but from that point onward, Władysław had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> George William, Elector of Brandenburg.|$|E
5|$|Edward enjoyed <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> Pope Clement V, {{despite the}} King's {{repeated}} {{intervention in the}} operation of the English Church, including punishing bishops with whom he disagreed. With Clement's support, Edward attempted to gain the financial support of the English Church for his military campaigns in Scotland, including taxation and borrowing money against the funds gathered for the crusades. The English Church did relatively little to influence or moderate Edward's behaviour during his reign, possibly because of the bishops' self-interest and concern for their own protection.|$|E

5|$|During this time, the U.S. Army {{underwent}} a drastic reduction in size. At {{the end of}} World War II, it contained 89 divisions, but by 1950, there were just 10 active divisions in the force, {{along with a few}} reserve divisions such as the 45th Infantry Division which were combat-ineffective. The division retained many of its best officers as senior commanders as the force downsized, and it enjoyed <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> its community. The 45th in this time was {{regarded as one of the}} better-trained National Guard divisions. Regardless, by mid-1950 the division had only 8,413 troops, less than 45 percent of its full-strength authorization. Only 10 percent of the division's officers and 5 percent of its enlisted men had combat experience with the division from World War II.|$|E

As years pass, Elspeth forms <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> her new husband, John, and stepdaughter, Snow White (who now becomes a beautiful princess 16 years later). However, Elspeth is vain and keeps a room full of magical mirrors which assure her each day that she is the fairest of them all whenever she asks.|$|E
5|$|Laurer had a {{strained}} {{relationship with her}} family.

5|$|Mugabe {{initially}} emphasised racial {{reconciliation and}} he was keen to build <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> white Zimbabweans. He hoped to avoid a white exodus and tried to allay fears that he would nationalise white-owned property. He appointed two white ministers—David Smith and Denis Norman—to his government, met with white leaders in agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce, and impressed senior figures in the outgoing administration like Smith and Ken Flower with his apparent sincerity. With {{the end of the}} war, petrol rationing, and economic sanctions, life for white Zimbabweans improved {{during the early years of}} Mugabe's regime. In the economic boom that followed, the white minority—which controlled considerable property and dominated commerce, industry, and banking—were the country's main beneficiaries.|$|E

He died on 1 June 1830 and was cremated according to Hindu rites in Gadhada, Gujarat. Before his death, Swaminarayan appointed his adopted nephews as acharyas to head the two dioceses of Swaminarayan Sampraday. Swaminarayan is also remembered within the sect for undertaking reforms for women and the poor, and performing yajñas (fire sacrifices) on a large scale.|$|E
5|$|An ala or hala (plural: ale or hali) is {{a female}} mythological {{creature}} {{recorded in the}} folklore of Bulgarians, Macedonians, and Serbs. Ale are considered demons of bad weather whose main purpose is to lead hail-producing thunderclouds {{in the direction of}} fields, vineyards, or orchards to destroy the crops, or loot and take them away. Extremely voracious, ale particularly like to eat children, though their gluttony is not limited to Earth. It is believed they sometimes try devouring the Sun or the Moon, causing eclipses, and that it would mean {{the end of the world}} should they succeed. When people encounter an ala, their mental or physical health, or even life, are in peril; however, her favor can be gained by approaching her with respect and trust. Being in <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> an ala is very beneficial, because she makes her favorites rich and saves their lives in times of trouble.|$|E
5|$|Bremner {{signed a}} new three-year {{contract}} in summer 1987. New arrivals {{at the club}} were Glynn Snodin (£150,000 from Sheffield Wednesday), winger Gary Williams (£230,000 from Aston Villa) and Bobby Davison (£350,000 from Derby County), as well as Jim Melrose and Ken DeMange. A more significant new face was David Batty, a key player of the future who was given his debut from the youth team. United started the season inconsistently, but five straight wins in December won Bremner the Second Division Manager of the Month award. The inconsistent results returned however, and Leeds finished the 1987–88 season in seventh place, eight points outside the play-offs. Bremner did not enjoy <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> the club's board, who felt him to be uncommunicative with them, and after a poor start to the 1988–89 season he was sacked in September 1988. His successor, Howard Wilkinson, was given money to spend by the board and Leeds {{went on to win}} promotion in 1990.|$|E

5|$|By this time, Schwarzkopf {{commanded}} {{an international}} army of 750,000, comprising 500,000 U.S. troops and 250,000 troops from other nations, {{as well as}} thousands of main battle tanks, combat aircraft and six carrier battle groups. Most of the U.S. and allied forces, however, were not combat veterans, and Schwarzkopf and the other allied commanders wanted to fight cautiously to minimize casualties. Schwarzkopf's experience in the Middle East allowed him to understand the factors surrounding the conflict, including allied commanders, with greater ease. He had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> Saudi commander Khalid bin Sultan, who in turn helped Schwarzkopf win over the Saudi Arabian populace. In spite of the cooperation, he later said he considered the Arab troops {{to be the least}} effective of the war. Schwarzkopf also had an agreeable relationship with his deputy commander, Lieutenant General Cal Waller, who handled much of the administrative burden. Peter de la Billière, commander of the British contingent, and Michel Roquejeoffre, commander of the French contingent, also cooperated well with Schwarzkopf. The good relationship between the allied commanders meant their forces were able to cooperate effectively during the operation.|$|E
5|$|Edward II succeeded as king of England on 7 July 1307, on {{the death}} of his father Edward I. The {{expectations}} of the new king were high, and he initially enjoyed <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> the leading magnates of the realm. There were, however, some issues of contention remaining from the reign of his father. Edward I's incessant wars had put a great fiscal burden on the country, and his confrontational style had led to conflict with some of the leading lay and ecclesiastical lords. This had culminated in the drafting of the so-called Remonstrances in 1297, a set of complaints about royal government. By Edward I's death in 1307, most of these issued had been resolved. It was nevertheless in the interest of the leading men of the country to make sure that the new king did not act the way his father had, and ignored the opinions of his councillors.|$|E
5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) {{wants to}} throw a party to {{celebrate}} his fifteenth anniversary working at Dunder Mifflin. He becomes unnerved when Charles Miner (Idris Elba), the new company vice president, exhibits a no-nonsense attitude towards him, making Michael not feel like his own boss. Charles seems to establish <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> {{the rest of the}} staff; he buys everyone lunch and reveals the truth about their 401(k) plans and the possibility of layoffs, which Michael withheld so as not to worry the staff. Taking advice from Chief Financial Officer David Wallace (Andy Buckley), Michael tries to become better acquainted with Charles, but is unsuccessful. Michael attempts to contact Wallace on the phone, one attempt leading to getting transferred to Charles. When Charles catches the Party Planning Committee planning Michael's party during office hours, he dissolves the committee and cancels Michael's party.
