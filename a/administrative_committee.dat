5|$|The {{creation}} of an Axis puppet-state known as the Kingdom of Montenegro was proclaimed on 12 July 1941. The state was to be headed by an Italian regent and led by Drljević and his supporters. By 13 July, this proclamation prompted the outbreak of an anti-Italian uprising in Montenegro led by local communists (Partisans) and Serb nationalists (Chetniks). Having assumed power the previous day, Drljević established the Provisional <b>Administrative</b> <b>Committee</b> of Montenegro, a collaborationist entity which was a territorial component of the Italian Empire. He also organized his followers to fight against Montenegrin Chetniks and the Yugoslav Partisans. In September, he was dismissed from office by the Italians.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, the Fleur-de-Lys <b>Administrative</b> <b>Committee</b> and the Birkirkara Local Council {{announced}} that they were planning to rebuild the arch to the same dimensions of the original. The police force had initially objected to the project, believing {{it could become a}} traffic hazard, but of similar risk comparisons to other monumental arches and gates in Malta, such as the Portes de Bombes. The plans were eventually approved by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority in October of the same year, but they were placed on hold since a tender appeal had to be sorted out. In April 2013, the tender was awarded to Vaults Ltd instead of V Contractors who had originally won the tender. The replica arch cost €280,000 to build, and €100,000 of these were donated by the Bank of Valletta. €40,000 were taken from the Good Causes Fund, while the remaining €140,000 were paid by the Birkirkara Local Council.|$|E
5|$|In Petersburg, Virginia, the {{two women}} moved out of broken seats in the black (and back) section of the bus, where state {{segregation}} laws mandated they sit, and into the white section. Inspired by a conversation they had been having about Gandhian civil disobedience, {{the two women}} refused {{to return to the}} rear even after the police were called. They were arrested and jailed. Murray and McBean initially were defended by the NAACP, but when the pair were convicted only of disorderly conduct rather than violating segregation laws, the organization ceased to represent them. The Workers' Defense League (WDL), a socialist labor rights organization that also was beginning to take civil rights cases, paid her fine. A few months later the WDL hired Murray for its <b>administrative</b> <b>committee.</b>|$|E

The School Council, which met once a week to plan school activities, consisted of seven students, three administrators, and three faculty.

25|$|The Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan {{originates}} {{from the}} merging of two separate groups which represent the two components of the Jordanian public: the Transjordanian and the West Bank Palestinian. On 9 November 1945 the Association of the Muslim Brotherhood (Jam‘iyat al-Ikhwan al-Muslimin) was officially registered and Abu Qura became its first General Supervisor. Abu Qura originally brought the Brotherhood to Jordan from Egypt after extensive study and spread of the teachings of Imam Hasan al-Banna. While most political parties and movements were banned {{for a long time}} in Jordan such as Hizb ut-Tahrir, the Brotherhood was exempted and allowed to operate by the Jordanian monarchy. In 1948, Egypt, Syria, and Transjordan offered “volunteers” to help Palestine in its war against Israel. Due to the defeat and weakening of Palestine, the Transjordanian and Palestinian Brotherhood merged. The newly merged Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan was primarily concerned with providing social services and charitable work as well as with politics and its role in the parliament. It was seen as compatible with the political system and supported democracy without the forced implementation of Sharia law which was part of its doctrine. However, internal pressures from younger members of the Brotherhood who called for more militant actions as well as his failing health, Abu Qura resigned as the leader of the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood. On 26 December 1953, Muhammad ‘Abd al-Rahman Khalifa, was elected by the movement’s <b>administrative</b> <b>committee</b> as the new leader of the Transjordanian Brotherhood and he retained this position until 1994. Khalifa was different than his predecessor and older members of the organization because he was not educated in Cairo, he was educated in Syria and Palestine. He established close ties with Palestinian Islamists during his educational life which led him to be jailed for several months in Jordan for criticizing Arab armies in the war. Khalifa also reorganized the Brotherhood and applied to the government to designate the Brotherhood as “a comprehensive and general Islamic Committee, instead of the previous basis of operation under the “Societies and Clubs Law”. This allowed the Brotherhood to spread throughout the country each with slight socioeconomic and political differences although the majority of the members were of the upper middle class. The radicalization of the Brotherhood began to take place after the peace process between Egypt and Israel, the Islamic Revolution of Iran, as well as their open criticism towards the Jordan-US relationship in the 1970s. Support for the Syrian branch of the Brotherhood also aided the radicalization of the group through open support and training for the rebel forces in Syria. The ideology began to transform into a more militant one which without it would not have the support of the Islamic radicals.|$|E

The Ivo Andrić Endowment has since organized a number of international conferences, made grants to foreign scholars studying the writer's works and offered financial aid to cover the publication costs of books covering Andrić's life and art. An annual yearbook, titled Sveske Zadužbine Ive Andrića (The Journals of the Ivo Andrić Endowment), is published by the organization. Andrić's will and testament stipulated that an award be given annually to the author of each subsequent year's best collection of short stories.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} arch was demolished in 1944, and a roundabout {{was later}} built on its site. The {{construction of a}} replica of the arch was approved in 2012. The local councils of Santa Venera and Birkirkara, as well as the Fleur-de-Lys <b>Administrative</b> <b>Committee</b> disagreed on what the arch's name should be, and eventually agreed in 2014 that it should be called [...] "The Wignacourt Arch Known As The Fleur-de-Lys Gate". The arch was reconstructed in 2015, and it was inaugurated on 28 April 2016. A coat-of-arm belonging to Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc was probably added to the arch looking towards Mdina after the restoration of the aqueduct by de Rohan, but no certainty can be established; this arm still exists and is located few metres away, close to St Joseph Tower (see below), attached to a wall outside the entrance of a police station.|$|E

500|$|In Belgium, a General Council was {{organized}} in 1911 by Antoine to manage all material issues. It is currently composed of nine members including a chairman, a treasurer and a secretary. The founction of the First Representative of the Father was abolished in 1971, {{and there are}} no internal regulations in the temples. In France, the movement is led by a religious association called [...] "Culte Antoiniste" [...] ("Antoinist Worship"). All the desservants are part of a College of Desservants which manage the material issues, and whose decisions are implemented by an <b>Administrative</b> <b>Committee.</b> Within the college, a Moral Secretary is elected and serves as legal representative of the religion. Locally, the desservants nominate auxiliaries among the dressed followers so that they perform reading during worship and/or serve as healers. A Council of Local Interior composed of seven members including desservants is used for issues related to the temple on which it depends. Women as well as men can be chosen as ministers, as Catherine promoted gender equality in the worship. In all cases, Antoine, although deceased, remains the leader of the religion, which led Debouxhtay to compare him to the Pope in the Catholic Church.|$|E
