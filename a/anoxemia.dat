She then {{was hired by the}} pediatric department of Johns Hopkins, the Harriet Lane Home, as its chief, where she served from 1930 until 1963. While there, she did extensive work on <b>anoxemia,</b> called [...] "blue baby syndrome", and discovered its cause as a partial blockage of the pulmonary artery either alone or combined with a hole between the ventricles of the infant's heart. She worked with surgeon Alfred Blalock and Vivien Thomas to develop a surgery to correct the defect, resulting in what is now known as the Blalock-Taussig-Thomas shunt. They first performed the corrective surgery on dogs but by 1946 began to perform the operation on human babies. That year, she became an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine; she was promoted to full professor in 1959. In 1947, Taussig published her magnum opus, Congenital Malformations of the Heart, considered to be the genesis of pediatric cardiology as an independent field.|$|E
40|$|The defects {{found in}} {{congenital}} heart disease are frequently of such character as to disturb the normal pathways of circulation through the heart. The common types of congenital lesions responsi-ble for diverting {{the normal course of}} blood are interventricular septal defects with or without pul-monary stenosis, auricular septal defects, and pa-tent ductus arteriosus. In these anomalies the hemodynamic relationship between the right and left side of the heart becomes so altered as to lead to a mechanical interference with the proper oxy-genation of the blood. When this obtains, quanti-ties of blood pass unaerated (venous-arterial shunt) from the right to {{the left side of the}} heart giving rise to varying degrees of oxygen unsatura-tion, cyanosis, and <b>anoxemia.</b> On the other hand, the course of the blood stream may be shunted from the left to the right side of the heart (ar-terial-venous shunt), thereby permitting oxygen-ated blood to pass back into the lesser circulation. Under the latter conditions there may be neither <b>anoxemia</b> nor cyanosis. In this study we have sought to obtain data re-garding the presence or absence of <b>anoxemia</b> and factors influencing its development. Information of this kind is of course important in congenital heart afflictions because prognoses, particularly of the potentially more serious defects, depend in general on the degree of <b>anoxemia</b> and the extent of the increase of the work of the heart. The degree of cyanosis is a valuable guide, but is not an accurate measure of <b>anoxemia.</b> If poly-cythemia is present, there may be a sufficient quantity of oxygen for the tissues and, in addi-tion, enough reduced hemoglobin to cause cyano-sis. Conversely, <b>anoxemia</b> may be present with-out visible cyanosis. We have attempted here to investigate this problem by studying the variation...|$|E

The levels of hypoxemia induced have been correlated with various other factors. The results are considered with particular reference to a possible critical range, within which changes in the circulation occur. T HE <b>ANOXEMIA</b> test for coronary in-sufficiency, as proposed by Levy, Bruenn, and Russell 1 in 1939, has been subjected to thorough clinical trial by a number of observers. 2 If properly performed on suitable subjects it is without hazard and yields results which are of value in clinical diagnosis. It has also been employed to study indirectly, in man, the action of various drugs on the coronary circulation. 3 ' 4 The result is determined by the effect of anoxia on the form of the electrocardio-gram; criteria for a positive reaction have been established 5 and widely used. The range of optimal levels of <b>anoxemia</b> at which such electrocardiographic changes occur is not known although {{it has been shown that}} there is wide individual variation with respect to the degree of <b>anoxemia</b> obtained while breathing 10 per cent oxygen.

40|$|The {{symptoms}} {{attending the}} partial or complete saturation of the hemoglobin {{of the blood}} with carbon monoxide. are too well known to require detailed comment. With as little as 40 per cent of the hemoglobin combined with carbon monoxide there may ensue deep coma, marked central nervous system symptoms with ankle clonus, positive Babinski and Kernig signs and often death. Occasionally the blood becomes free of carbon monoxide, the coma terminates, but the patient subsequently sinks into coma again and dies, probably {{as a result of}} central nervous system damage. The exact explanation of this train of symptoms is not entirely clear. - Presumably the effects of carbon monoxide asphyxia are those of <b>anoxemia.</b> For, as is well known, <b>anoxemia</b> long continued results in irremedial damage to nervous tissue. This <b>anoxemia</b> is not due primarily to a reduction of the total oxygen of the blood as is commonly supposed, but rather to a marked lowering of the partial pressure at which oxygen is available for tissue metabolism. As will be shown subsequently this effect {{is the result of a}} marked alteration in the form of oxygen dissociation curve of blood by carbon monoxide. In the light of this alteration the desperate condition of a subject whose blood is half saturated with CO as contrasted with the comparatively comfortable condition of one who as in anemia cases, has merely lost half his hemoglobin is understandable. That the effects of carbon monoxide are entirely those of <b>anoxemia</b> is at present an assumption based upon the fact that its toxic effects are supposedly nil.

Experiments were carried out in the rabbit. 1) Acute hemorrhage has diminished the values of blood constituents, and the blood gas has been caused to represent the symptoms of acute <b>anoxemia.</b> The larger the quantity of bleeding the more marked were these changes, with the peak of symptoms having been reached in about 2 days after bleeding. An improvement of these symptoms took 10 - 14 days and 2 - 3 weeks in the bleeding of medium degree (10 cc per Kg. of body weight) and of large degree (20 cc per Kg. body weight), respectively. 2) The administration of oxygen by means of closed circuit anesthesia has shown remarkable effect in the treatment of acute hemorrhage; anemic symptoms were slight and the total disappearance of the symptoms of <b>anoxemia</b> was observed during the ad ministration of oxygen. However, <b>anoxemia</b> has occurred again when the administration of oxygen was discontinued, and the ultimate recovery was not expedited. 3) The transfusion of the same quantity of whole blood as was lost in bleeding, in combination with the administration of oxygen, has brought about almost the total disappearance of anemic symptoms. Under this treatment, the symptoms of <b>anoxemia</b> have been greatly improved even after the discontinuance of the administration of oxygen, and consequently the ultimate recovery was expedited.

40|$|The {{responsiveness}} of {{the smallest}} blood vessels of the human skin was measured in systemic <b>anoxemia,</b> hypercapnia, acidosis, and alkalosis. A method was used which measured quantitatively the reactive hyperemia produced by a standardized period of local ischemia of these fine vessels. By timing the clearing period of the threshold hyperemia response a direct indication of blood flow in these fine vessels was obtained. The following conclusions were reached concerning the responses {{of the smallest}} blood vessels of the skin. 1. Systemic <b>anoxemia</b> causes a decrease in sensitivity to local ischemia and a slowing of the blood flow. 2. Hypercapnia prevents the changes resulting from <b>anoxemia.</b> 3. These changes in the smallest blood vessels of the skin occur independently of changes in pulse rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate and depth. 4. With systemic acidosis there is a decrease in sensitivity to local ischemia and a slowing of blood flow. The exact opposite takes place in systemic alkalosis. 5.

40|$|Studies of {{patients}} with congenital heart disease {{in which there is}} a leftto-right shunt have revealed, in about 15 %o, arterial unsaturation which is completely alleviable by the administration of oxygen.

In this report there will be presented anatomical and physiological reasons to believe that the <b>anoxemia</b> experienced by these patients lies in impaired diffusion of oxygen at the pulmonary alveolar-capillary level.

(2) The inhibitory effect still appears after the severing of the vagus nerves at the caudal end of the esophagus, but is obliterated and reversed to the augmentory when the splanchnic nerves are bilaterally severed.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{mechanism in}} the production of edema in heart failure has been considered to be an increase in the capillary pressure (1, 2). Ad-ditional factors, possibly of minor importance, are increased capillary permeability due to <b>anoxemia</b> and slight lowering of plasma colloidal osmotic pressure as a result of decrease of plasma pro-teins. These have been emphasized by Landis and Krogh (3, 4). The general opinion, how-ever, is that lowered colloidal osmotic pressure is not a constant finding in heart disease (5). Lan-dis (3, 4) demonstrated increased protein filtra-tion in the capillaries of the frog mesentery after oxygen deprivation, and by indirect methods showed the same thing in the arm in man. The protein content of the transudate in Landis ' ex-*periments averaged 1. 5 per cent. Vancura (20) presents analyses in support of {{the idea that there is}} considerable increase in permeability of the capillary wall to protein in chronic heart disease. Haas (6) attributes edema formation to dis-turbances in the "vital function " of the capil-lary endothelium with consequent alterations in permeability. He states that in circulatory edema the protein content of the fluid varies directly with the extent of the edema. Drinker (7, 8) believes that the normal capillary transudate is similar to lymph in composition, containing 1 to 4 per cent of protein. He also states that the lymph flow in circulatory edema is even greater than normal, the capillary filtrate presumably changing but little in composition.

[...] Injection of barium sulfate microemboli {{into the right}} side of the heart of paralyzed, artificially ventilated cats increased pulmonary resistance, decreased pulmonary compliance and functional residual capacity, and increased end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure and anatomic dead space. These effects could be due to constriction of terminal respiratory units without significant narrowing of the large airways, which may actually enlarge. Anatomic studies, performed after rapid freezing of the lungs in the open thorax, showed that the principal site of constriction was the alveolar ducts. Intra-venous isoproterenol partially or completely prevented the changes following microembolism, suggesting that they were due to smooth muscle contraction. Vagotomy, injection of heparin or atropine or guanethedine, or inhalation of 6 % carbon dioxide did not prevent the changes; prior injections of 48 / 80 decreased the changes. These studies suggest that the embolism-induced changes depend on histamine release.

The latter are activated by <b>anoxemia</b> which appears to be due to opening of arteriovenous com-munications in the embolized lungs. In the perfused lungs, the hypertension of embolization is the outcome of mechanical obstruction by the emboli plus reflex vasoconstriction which is partly mediated by the extrinsic pulmonary nerves.

The introduction by Cannon (29) of the x-ray technique {{for the study of the}} position, size and movements of the stomach made it possible to make qualitative observations and to investigate the factors regulating motility. For quantitative records, however, recourse must still be made to direct methods and the use of decerebrate a#nd decapi-tate preparations allows experiments to be made without the use of anesthetics. These preparations, while offering considerable advantages, are not ideal, as tlhe actual operation causes considerable shock to the stomach. Further, the recent work of Beattie, Brow and Long (11) suggests that decerebrations made at certain levels may injure nuclei of the hypothalamus, thus interfering with the extrinsic nerve supply. While the use of isolated vagus and sympathetic smooth muscle preparations possesses obvious disadvantages, namely, loss of blood supply, <b>anoxemia,</b> etc., it nevertheless affords the only means of making a quantitative study of the effect of stimulating the vagus and sympa-thetic nerves and following accurately the response of the muscles to different strengths and frequencies of stimulation. The excellent monograph of Cannon (30) published in 1911 deals with the mechanical factors of digestion, while Alvarez (2) in his recent boo...|$|E
40|$|Iron {{absorption}} is {{a function}} of the gastro-intestinal mucosal epithelium. The normal non-anemic dog absorbs little iron but chronic anemia due to blood loss brings about considerable absorption—perhaps 5 to 15 times normal. In general the same differences are observed in man (1). Sudden change from normal to severe anemia within 24 hours does not significantly increase iron absorption. As the days pass new hemoglobin is formed. The body iron stores are depleted and within 7 days iron absorption is active, even when the red cell hematocrit is rising. <b>Anoxemia</b> of 50 per cent normal oxygen concentration for 48 hours does not significantly enhance iron absorption. In this respect it resembles acute anemia. Ordinary doses of iron given 1 to 6 hours before radio-iron will cause some "mucosa block"—that is an intake of radio-iron less than anticipated. Many variables which modify peristalsis come into this reaction. Iron given by vein some days before the dose of radio-iron does not appear to inhibit iron absorption. Plasma radio-iron absorption curves vary greatly. The curves may show sharp peaks in 1 to 2 hours when the iron is given in an empty stomach but after 6 hours when the radio-iron is given with food. Duration time of curves also varies widely, the plasma iron returning to normal in 6 to 12 hours. Gastric, duodenal, or jejunal pouches all show very active absorption of iron. The plasma concentration peak may reach a maximum before the solution of iron is removed from the gastric pouch—another example of "mucosa block. " Absorption and distribution of radio-iron in the body of growing pups give very suggestive experimental data. The spleen, heart, upper gastro-intestinal tract, marrow, and pancreas show more radio-iron than was expected. The term "physiological saturation" with iron may be applied to the gastro-intestinal mucosal epithelium and explain one phase of acceptance or refusal of ingested iron. Desaturation is a matter of days not hours, whereas saturation may take place within 1 to 2 hours. We believe this change is a part of the complex protein metabolism of the cell...|$|E

Roger, an adolescent of seventeen, brought up in thedepths of the depression, never far from hunger and often close to starvation,obtains temporary employment tending the furnace in a high school. On anevening when he has not eaten for three days, he catches a rabbit in the nearby woods and, {{in violation of the}} school rules, prepares to grill it in the furnace. Thus engaged, he is surprised by one Angela, a horrid child of thirteen, the sister of an acquaintance. Angela 2 ̆ 7 s disposition, never very sweet, has been soured by the fear that she may be pregnant by her brother, who has just Roger drops broken off an incestuous relationship of some weeks by raping her. Startled, Roger drops the rabbit on the coals, where it is quickly incinerated. Worse, Angela threatens to report his violation of the rules and have him fired. Enraged at losing his dinner and alarmed at the prospect of delation to the authorities, he seizes Angela and shakes her. She screams and struggles. To silence her, he grasps her by the throat. At this point the usual red mist of temporary insanity descends; when Roger comes to himself Angela is dead of <b>anoxemia,</b> fracture or dislocation of the cervical vertebrae, and asphyxia. Aware -that he is in an awkward position, but unaware that a human cadaver is one of the least combustible things in the world, Roger determines to thrust her in the furnace. The top part of Angela goes in fairly easily, but the hindquarters stick. As he heaves and pushes, an arm flops out of the furnace;grasping it, he burns his fingers and -thrusts them in his mouth. Thereupon events proceed as in the Dissertation on Roast Pig. The meat is described (on what evidence. is not clear) as tender, although rare, the crackling being particularly savory. In short, Roger consumes a generous portion of Angela. Thereupon he is sick. He flees the mess in panic, wanders in a trance, is caught and freely confesses...|$|E
40|$|Atherosclerosis is {{a disease}} that affects large and medium sized arteries. The {{majority}} of deaths in a Western population can be directly attributed to complications of this disease. Although research efforts have been vast, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis are not fully understood. According to the <b>anoxemia</b> theory of atherosclerosis, an imbalance between the demand for and supply of oxygen and nutrients at depth of the arterial wall is {{a key factor in}} the development of atherosclerotic lesions. In vitro evidence indicates that zones of hypoxia occur at depth of the atherosclerotic plaque. However, the energy metabolic characteristics of the arterial wall in vivo are not fully described. The focus {{of this study was to}} study different aspects of arterial wall energy metabolism in vivo. The hypoxia marker 7 -(4 '-(2 -nitroimidazol- 1 -yl) -butyl) -theophylline (NITP) was used to study arterial wall hypoxia. The technique of hypoxia markers have been developed in cancer research and have not previously been used on arterial tissue in vivo. In short, hypoxia markers are trapped in hypoxic, but viable, cells and can be detected in tissue sections with immunohistochemistry. NITP was injected in atherosclerotic rabbits in vivo and the aorta was removed after an accumulation period of 4 - 6. 5 hours. In paraffin sections of the aorta, zones of hypoxia were demonstrated at depth of atherosclerotic plaques that were more than 4 - 500 µm thick. To analyze local concentrations of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), glucose and lactate in arteries a bioluminescence technique, bioluminescence imaging, was used. Bioluminescence imaging is used to study energy metabolic heterogeneities in cryosections of snap frozen tissue and have not previously been used on arteries. In vitro experiments were performed on arterial segments from pigs (normal vessels) and rabbits (normal and atherosclerotic vessels) to test and optimize the methodology. Bioluminescence imaging allowed for quantification of local concentrations of ATP, glucose and lactate at a spatial resolution of 1 - 200 µm. To study the in vivo situation, a technique to freeze the aorta in situ in anaesthetized rabbits was used. With this technique, the delay between cessation of normal blood flow and freezing was kept at an absolute minimium (3 - 4 seconds), thus the in vivo situation was reflected. Energy metabolic failure (ATP depletion) was demonstrated at a distance of 3 - 500 µm from the lumen in rabbit lesions. Glucose concentrations were low, and lactate concentrations were high in lesion, probably reflecting an increase in both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism. Furthermore, ATP concentrations were reduced and lactate concentrations increased in the media underlying lesions compared to the undiseased media. In conclusion, the results presented in this thesis suggest that hypoxia and energy metabolic failure occurs at depth of the atherosclerotic plaque in vivo. Furthermore, energy metabolic predicaments are also seen in the underlying media. We suggest that the strained energy metabolic situation is the result of a local shortage of oxygen and glucose due to increased diffusion distances in combination with an increased metabolic demand and lactate accumulation within the lesions...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston University, 1940 When a {{resident}} from sea level ascends to high altitude, several important adaptive responses {{must be made}} if the body is to maintain its efficiency in the new environment. At altitudes above 12, 000 or 13, 000 feet, the necessary responses are of such magnitude as to require several days for completion, and {{the efficiency of the}} body is likely to be seriously impaired for a time. Mountain sickness, characterized by dyspnoea, severe headache, nausea, muscular weakness, loss of appetite, and various other symptoms, is the most common high altitude ailment. Glacier lassitude, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, and Monge's disease are other conditions resulting from faulty acclimatization. The chief factor by which the high altitude environment differs from that at sea level are: reduced oxygen tension in the atmosphere; more extreme conditions of air temperature; dryness of the air; and increased solar radiation. Of these, the low oxygen is the most important, and the difficulties at high altitude are chiefly a matter of <b>anoxemia.</b> Respiration responds immediately to high altitude by an increase in depth. At very high altitude and during prolonged stays at moderately high elevations, there is also an increase the respiratory rate. When the proper change has been made in the carbon dioxide level of the blood, the volume of respiration is sufficient to cause a rise of several millimeters of Hg in the alveolar oxygen tension, thus adding materially to the ability of the body to obtain oxygen from the reduced atmosphere. The muscles controlling respiration become much stronger during the long residence at high altitude. The vital capacity decreases somewhat, probably due to congestion of the lungs with blood. Circulation shows response in all its phases. The pulse increases markedly, reaching its maximum in about two days and returning later toward normal. Cardiac output reaches its maximum in a few days, then drops off as does the pulse rate. Systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure all rise after a few hours at high altitude. Pulse presure returns to normal, but the other pressures remain slightly higher except at very high altitudes, where the pulse pressure also drops. Venous pressure drops off proportionately as the altitude increases. The condition of the heart remains normal up to the limit of acclimitization, but at extreme altitudes the heart rhythm becomes irregular, and the heart is dilated. All of these changes in circulation work together to increase the rate of circulation and help to lessen the degree of oxygen lack. The blood makes two very important adaptive responses. The first of these is a change in the number and condition of the red blood corpuscules. At very high altitude, the red cell counts may increase as much as 50 percent above the sea level value. The total hemoglob 1 n content of th blood is thus increases, but not to such a degree, since the quantity of hemeglobin in each cell is somewhat reduced. The cell volume and diameter are increased. This change provides a much larger surface area, per unit volume of hemoglobin, so that the absorption of oxygen as the blood passes through the lungs is greatly speeded up. The second blood change is a reduction in the alkaline reserve to compensate for excessive loss or carbon dioxide through the increased pulmonary ventilation. The changes in the carbon dioxide level have several effects. The initial loss interferes with the response or the respiratory center to the oxygen shortage, but does belp the situation by changing the oxygen dissociation curve of the blood so that the hemoglobin combines more readily with oxygen. After a few days, the blood regains its normal pH, or may become a little more acid than normal. By this time, the chnages in the red cells have improved the ability of the blood to absorb oxygen from the lungs, and the acidity of the blood aids in the unloading or oxygen from the blood to the bodily tissues. The acidity also stimulates the respiratory center, and produces a further rise in respiration. When the changes of the blood have reached completion, circulation returns almost to normal. The rate of oxygen consumption seems to be slightly increased during rest at high altitude, probably because of the greater activity of the respiratory and circulatory systems. During exercise, the oxygen consumption is markedly lover at high altitude than at sea level, because the body can not obtain oxygen as rapidly. Since oxygen consumption is the ultimate control for physical work, the ability of the body to perform work is reduced at high altitudes. During work at high altitude, respiration and circulation are speeded up more than for the same load of work at sea level, and the efficiency of these functions drops considerably. In healthy men it can not be demonstrated that any one organ or function fails during work; the body as a whole merely reaches the maximum of its ability to obtain oxygen from the air and distribute it to the tissues. The digestive processes are subject to important alterations at high altitudes. The emptying time of the stomach is increased proportionately as the oxygen tension falls. At very high altitudes, the diet must be changed, as most proteins can no longer be easily digested. Even with the best possible diet, digestion is impaired, and tbe appetite is poor. Malnutrition and loss of weight result. Altitudes of 5, 000 to 10, 000 feet seem to have a bennificial influence upon health, especially in people who suffer from any disease of the respiratory tract. This is probably to the clean dry air and the strong sunlight. Sufferers from any serious cardiac disorder are endangered by ascent to high altitude, even by train or plane, because of the strain of the increased circulation. Adaptation to life at high altitude seems to be most rapid and most complete in healthy young adults who are in good physical condition. True adaptation seems to be limited to about 18, 000 feet. Healthy men can live for indefinite periods at 17, 000 to 18, 000 with no apparent ill eftects. Mountaineers have been as high as 28, 000 feet for short periods, and have lived for weeks at 20, 000 feet and above, but these exploits are always accompanied by a steady decline in health and vigor. At 20, 000 feet or above, there is loss of weight, loss of physical strength, impairment of mental acuity, and a general souring of the disposition. Certain organs, including heart, lungs, and liver, may undergo actual histological deterioration...|$|E
