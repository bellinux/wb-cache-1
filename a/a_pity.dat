At other times there were long periods of peace and prosperity.|$|E
25|$|England's reply {{began with}} an 'electrifying' 88 in an hour by Boycott and Barber – what <b>a</b> <b>pity</b> that {{circumstances}} prevented this glamorous partnership from regularly plaguing England's opponents once this tour was over! From this beginning all those following took profit, so that England, {{for the first time}} in Australia since the Bodyline tour thirty-odd years before, topped 500.|$|E

As a faithful servant of the state, he believed that he should restrict himself to a sober, concise presentation of the bare essentials.|$|E
25|$|While Arjuna {{destroying}} {{the rest of}} the Shakatavuyha, Vikarna, the third eldest Kaurava, challenged Arjuna to an archery fight. Arjuna asked Bhima to decimate Vikarna, but Bhima refused to, because Vikarna had defended the Pandavas during the Draupadi Vastrapaharanam. Bhima and Vikarna showered arrows at each other. Later Bhima threw his mace at Vikarna, killing him. The muscular Pandava was devastated and mourned his death saying {{he was a man of}} Dharma and it was <b>a</b> <b>pity</b> how he lived his life. Drona killed Vrihatkshatra, the ruler of Kekaya and Dhrishtakethu, the ruler of Chedi.|$|E
25|$|Finding the French escort to be {{substantially}} larger than anticipated, {{and that it}} was manoeuvring to intercept them, Forrest called his captains together for a conference aboard his ship. The three captains met on the quarterdeck of Augusta, whereupon Forrest stated 'Well, gentlemen, you see that they have come out to engage us.' Suckling replied 'I think it would be <b>a</b> <b>pity</b> to disappoint them', to which Langdon agreed. Forrest then closed the discussion by saying 'very well, go onboard your ships again', which Langdon and Suckling proceeded to do, the conference having lasted just half a minute.|$|E

25|$|In 1982, a Single Sculls Event {{was added}} {{and the start}} was moved to Fawley so that the course was closer to 1000m. As the {{intermediate}} start installations were required for the shorter distance, the races had to take place during intervals in the normal racing programme (the lunch or tea breaks) which meant that only the dedicated stayed to watch. This was <b>a</b> <b>pity,</b> since {{the final of the}} Women's Invitation Single was a highlight of the regatta, with Beryl Mitchell of Thames Tradesmen’s Rowing Club (World Silver medallist in 1981) beating Stephanie Foster of Waiariki Rowing Club, New Zealand (World Bronze medallist in 1982) by one length. Astrid Ayling was also able to race legitimately, winning the Invitation Double Sculls event with Rosie Clugston.|$|E

25|$|Zhang Ren {{appears in}} {{chapters}} 60–64 {{of the historical}} novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises {{the events in the}} late Eastern Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period. Like his historical counterpart, Zhang Ren serves under Liu Zhang and is known for being very loyal to his lord. When Liu Bei first enters Yi Province in the name of helping Liu Zhang counter a rival warlord, Zhang Lu, Zhang Ren and others warn Liu Zhang to be wary of Liu Bei and take precautionary measures, but Liu Zhang ignores them. When Liu Zhang attends a banquet hosted by Liu Bei, Liu Bei's strategist Pang Tong instructs the general Wei Yan to pretend to perform a sword dance and use the opportunity to assassinate Liu Zhang. Zhang Ren senses danger so he draws his sword and pretends to join the sword dance while secretly protecting Liu Zhang from Wei Yan's advances. When war breaks out between Liu Bei and Liu Zhang, Zhang Ren sets up an ambush at the Valley of the Fallen Phoenix, where his archers kill Pang Tong. After Zhang Ren is captured alive, Liu Bei asks him to surrender but he firmly refuses and is executed. Liu Bei feels it was <b>a</b> <b>pity</b> so he has Zhang Ren buried with full honours.|$|E

500|$|His {{most ambitious}} {{trip to the}} region was however in July 1910, when he {{undertook}} to explore the interior of Labrador, saying [...] "it seemed to us <b>a</b> <b>pity</b> that such a terra incognita should continue to exist under the British flag". This same territory had claimed the life of writer Leonidas Hubbard a few years earlier. He described his journey up the Fraser River to access Indian House Lake on George River in the popular Through Trackless Labrador in 1911.|$|E

500|$|In {{the final}} half-verse, {{following}} a brief instrumental passage, Harrison personalises the second line of Crisp's text to [...] "You know my faults, now let my foibles pass". Rodriguez remarks {{that the subject}} of reserving judgement would have resonated with Harrison at this time, given the [...] "shellacking" [...] he had recently received in music publications such as Rolling Stone. On the released recording, the song fades out during {{a repeat of the}} [...] "isn't it <b>a</b> <b>pity</b> how..." [...] coda.|$|E
500|$|As {{a further}} {{reference}} to the sentiment regarding friendship expressed in [...] "Isn't It a Pity", the middle section of [...] "The Answer's at the End" [...] reflects the influence of Nina Simone's 1972 cover of that earlier song. According to his recollection in I, Me, Mine, Harrison added this section, or coda, when recording [...] "The Answer's at the End". In the lines [...] "And isn't it <b>a</b> <b>pity</b> how / We hurt the ones we love the most of all...", Inglis notes {{the influence of the}} 1944 pop standard [...] "You Always Hurt the One You Love".|$|E
500|$|He {{also began}} {{studying}} revolutionary politics including the Marxist theory of Henri Lefebvre, who {{introduced him to}} the Communist poet Louis Aragon in 1928.

500|$|Some Khasi men {{perceive}} {{themselves to be}} accorded a secondary status. They have established societies such as the Syngkhong Rympei Thymmai (SRT) (3,000 members) and Sam Kam Rin Ku Mai (Societal Restructuring Association) to protect equal rights for men. They express that [...] "Khasi men don’t have any security, they don’t own land, they don’t run the family business and, at the same time, they are almost good for nothing.” However, Patricia Mukhim, who edits the Shillong Times feels: [...] "I tend to think Khasi men feel diminished in their manhood compared with outsiders... it's <b>a</b> <b>pity,</b> because that's what distinguishes us from the others".|$|E

It appears in two variations there: one the well-known, seven-minute version; the other a reprise, titled [...] "Isn't It <b>a</b> <b>Pity</b> (Version Two)". Harrison wrote the song in 1966, but it was rejected for inclusion on releases by the Beatles. In many countries around the world, the song was also issued on a double A-side single with [...] "My Sweet Lord". In America, Billboard magazine listed it with [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] when the single topped the Hot 100 chart, while in Canada, [...] "Isn't It a Pity" [...] reached number 1 as the preferred side.|$|E
500|$|Despite her avid {{consumption}} of books, however, Emmeline {{was not given}} the educational advantages enjoyed by her brothers.

Although they supported women's suffrage and the general advancement of women in society, the Gouldens believed their daughters incapable {{of the goals of}} their male peers. Feigning sleep one evening as her father came into her bedroom, Emmeline Goulden heard him pause and say to himself: [...] "What <b>a</b> <b>pity</b> she wasn't born a lad." ...|$|E
