25|$|Vomiting in the helmet. This {{can be a}} real {{emergency}} and life-threatening if not handled effectively, as the diver can aspirate the vomit and asphyxiate. Once again, the action is to open the free flow valve, preferably before vomiting, and to inhale <b>as</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>as</b> possible. If there is no free flow valve, as on a full face mask, the purge button should clear the demand valve and oro-nasal mask, and the mask can be rinsed by lifting the bottom edge away from the face to let in some water, before purging again.|$|E
500|$|Washington would {{normally}} have assigned {{the duties of}} advance guard to Daniel Morgan and his riflemen, but he had detached these to assist Horatio Gates {{in the defense of}} the Hudson River Valley against the advance of General John Burgoyne. [...] Since they were unavailable, he organized a light infantry corps consisting of 700 picked men from Continental Army regiments (including future Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall, who would go on to fight in the coming battle) and about 1,000 Pennsylvania and Delaware militia, and placed them under the command of Brigadier General William Maxwell. [...] These troops occupied Iron Hill and Cooch's Bridge. General Nathanael Greene advocated moving the entire Continental Army to this position, believing the Christina River to be a more defensible point, but Washington declined, instead ordering [...] Maxwell to monitor British movements and slow its advance {{while the rest of the}} army fortified the Red Clay Creek and Wilmington. [...] Maxwell's men were encamped on either side of the road leading south from Cooch's Bridge toward Aiken's Tavern (present-day Glasgow, Delaware) in a series of small camps designed to facilitate ambushes. [...] On August 28, Washington, atop Iron Hill, and Howe, on Gray's Hill, observed each other as they took stock of the enemy's position; one of the Hessian generals wrote, [...] "These gentlemen observed us with their glasses <b>as</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>as</b> we observed them. [...] Those of our officers who know Washington well, maintained that the man in the plain coat was Washington." ...|$|E

2500|$|B. Barry Levy {{notes that}} the 16th century Rabbi Ibn Zimra recounted [...] "how he {{restored}} the scrolls to their original state" [...] and noted [...] "the importance of having textual consistency in the scrolls, because criticisms of how Jews preserved and transmitted the Torah text contained accusations that they willfully changed it." [...] Levy also suggests that [...] "Torah scrolls remain prized and frequently used ritual objects, and scribes have continually worked <b>as</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>as</b> possible to copy them, always holding dear the belief that they were producing as accurate and correct a text as they could. Unfortunately even this commitment and care could not guarantee a letter-perfect text".|$|E
2500|$|Maintenance records {{revealed}} that the 65–76 [...] "Kit" [...] practice torpedo carried by Kursk came from a batch of ten manufactured in 1990, six of which were rejected due to faulty welding. An investigation {{revealed that}} because the torpedoes were not intended to carry warheads, the welds had not been inspected <b>as</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>as</b> welds on torpedoes carrying warheads. When salvage crews finally recovered {{the remains of the}} torpedo and the launch tube, analysis determined that both bore signs of distortion and heat damage that were consistent with an explosion near the middle of the torpedo, very close to an essential welded joint. The official conclusion of the commission was that a faulty weld had led to the explosion.|$|E

McClure (later to become a professor of Divinity at Vanderbilt University), and Ron Easley, and with drummers Doug Garrison and, from 1993 on, Richard Dworkin (who also played for many years with the jazz group The Microscopic Septet), Chilton gained a reputation for his eclectic taste in song covers, guitar work, and laconic stage presence. Writing about a live performance in the New York Times, critic Peter Watrous said of Chilton that [...] "He's a soul and blues guitar connoisseur; he chooses his guitar licks <b>as</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>as</b> he does the blues songs he covers, and during his solos, a listener heard a history of soul and blues guitar." [...] Watrous {{went on to say}} of the show that [...] "Irony flowed over everything, {{and it was hard to}} tell exactly what Mr. Chilton was after, except perhaps a little fun." ...|$|E

2500|$|Managing {{editor of}} The Sun, Richard Caseby, said the {{newspaper}} had faced [...] "a very difficult decision". Both media outlets argued they had released the video [...] "in the public interest". BBC News showed {{some parts of}} the video. Sky News decided not to follow suit, as senior editors were of the opinion that the graphic images were [...] "unnecessarily distressing". Both ITV and the BBC ran warnings before showing the footage. Most of Britain's national daily newspapers grabbed still images from the video footage for their front pages the next morning. A BBC executive said that the news organisation edited the footage before broadcasting, and [...] "dealt with the material <b>as</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>as</b> we could." [...] The spokesman said they [...] "thought very carefully about the pictures...and gave great consideration to how we used the footage". They argued that the footage was an important element of the story and shed light on the perpetrators and the possible motives for the attack." ...|$|E
2500|$|An article {{reportedly}} {{written by}} the composer appeared in the Moscow newspaper Vechernyaya Moskva {{a few days before}} the premiere of the Fifth Symphony. There, he reportedly states that the work [...] "is a Soviet artist’s creative response to justified criticism." [...] Whether Shostakovich or someone more closely connected with the Party actually wrote the article is open to question, but the phrase [...] "justified criticism"—a reference to the denunciation of the composer in 1936—is especially telling. Official critics treated the work as a turnaround in its composer's career, a personal perestroyka or [...] "restructuring" [...] by the composer, with the Party engineering Shostakovich's rehabilitation <b>as</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>as</b> it had his fall a couple of years earlier. Like the Pravda attack at that time on the opera Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District, the political basis for extolling the Fifth Symphony was to show how the Party could make artists bow to its demands. It had to show that it could reward as easily and fully as it could punish.|$|E
2500|$|Boat 8 {{was loaded}} with 28 people under the {{supervision}} of Second Officer Lightoller and launched at about 1:00a.m., with Captain Smith and Chief Officer Wilde participating. Boat 8 was the first lifeboat on the port side to be lowered. Ida Straus, wife of New York merchant Isidor Straus, was asked to join a group of people preparing to board but refused, saying, [...] "I will not be separated from my husband. As we have lived, so will we die– together." [...] The 67-year-old Isidor likewise refused an offer to board on account of his age, saying: [...] "I do not wish any distinction in my favor which is not granted to others." [...] They were last seen alive on deck arm in arm. Major Archibald Butt, military aide to US President William Howard Taft, escorted to the boat Marie Young, a former music teacher to the children of President Theodore Roosevelt. She later recalled he [...] "wrapped blankets about me and tucked me in <b>as</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>as</b> if we were going on a motor ride." [...] He wished her farewell and good luck, asking her to [...] "remember me to the folks back home." [...] Other single women were brought to the boats by men who had earlier offered their services to [...] "unprotected ladies," [...] as the conventions of the era dictated.|$|E
