500|$|In the {{continuing}} Arab–Israeli conflict, although the initial cease fire had been implemented to end active {{conflict in the}} Yom Kippur War, Kissinger's continuing shuttle diplomacy was showing little progress. Ford considered it [...] "stalling" [...] and wrote, [...] "Their [...] tactics frustrated the Egyptians <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> mad as hell." [...] During Kissinger's shuttle to Israel in early March 1975, a last minute reversal to consider further withdrawal, prompted a cable from Ford to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, which included: ...|$|E
500|$|A year later, Frusciante and {{his mother}} moved to Mar Vista, Los Angeles with his new {{stepfather}} who, he says, [...] "really supported me <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel good about being an artist." [...] Like many {{young people in the}} area, he became intimately involved in the L.A. punk rock scene. At nine he was infatuated with the Germs, wearing out several copies of their record (GI). By ten, he had taught himself how to play most of (GI)'s songs. He has stated that he did not really know what he was doing, and that he would play every chord with a single-finger barre.|$|E
500|$|Isie was an {{intelligent}} young woman who, like Smuts, had scored highly in her Matriculation exam. It was thought, as a girl, {{a future in}} higher education was largely closed to her. The time spent in her company, whether reading poetry and singing together at the piano, or walking together in the mornings and evenings on the journey to and from Victoria College, did much to break down Smuts's social isolation, enabling him to cast some of those protective prejudices which he had harboured of the [...] "puerile element", {{that is to say}} his peers. As he wrote in his diary some years later: [...] ", less idealistic than I, but more human, recalled me from my intellectual isolation <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> return to my fellows." ...|$|E

500|$|Platten {{dedicated}} {{the visual}} to her music teacher in elementary school, Anne Scigliano. The singer spoke about Scigliano: [...] " [...] {{gave me my}} first starring role in a play, and inspired me, <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> love the stage." [...] The singer also commented regarding the filming shoot, [...] "The entire day was such a love fest, casting actual fans {{to participate in this}} shoot really brought the concept to life. Surprising and singing along with them was just the icing on the cake. Every time I watch it I still get the feels!" [...] The video for [...] "Better Place" [...] premiered on her Vevo account on May 9, 2016. It was released as a paid download in the United States on the following day. Emilee Linder from Fuse reacted positively to it, finding it to be inspiring and full of [...] "syrupy goodness".|$|E
500|$|In 1979, Gray {{spoke with}} TV Guide (Canada) and recounted: [...] "At first, {{they had no}} idea what to do with the part. Sue Ellen's lines ran to 'More coffee, darling?' and 'I have a headache.' Victoria Principal and Patrick Duffy were the goody-goodies. Jim Davis and Barbara Bel Geddes were parental. Hagman was the villain. And I was the redhead on the couch." [...] However, Gray was {{upgraded}} to a starring role once Dallas was picked up for a full season following the five episode arc miniseries. The actress later stated that on-screen husband Larry Hagman had criticized one of her performances early on during the start of the series, and called it [...] "terrible", though he denied it. She joked, [...] "I'm sorry. He said it to me loud and clear, <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel terrible, and it started one of our first fights on the way back [...] I swear to you—he devastated me. Then, years later, he said, 'Oh, I didn't mean that.' I could have killed him!" ...|$|E
500|$|SFScope {{columnist}} Sarah Stegall {{agreed with}} Murray's Lost comparison, writing that {{the ending of}} the episode was [...] "right out of the Lost playbook, a little too on the nose for my liking." [...] Stegall did however call it a [...] "good bridge episode, taking us from the setup of last week to the denouement next week, when it all comes together." [...] IGN writer Ramsey Isler was more positive about the final sequence, explaining that the [...] "last five minutes of this story changed everything, <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> excited about the series again." [...] While praising the special effects, he also noted his displeasure that Sam Weiss [...] "ends up not being as mystical or magical as previous stories hinted". Isler wished Corrigan had more screen time in the episode, calling it [...] "under-utilization of a great character the writers {{have spent a lot of}} time building up." [...] He rated it 7.5/10, an indication of a [...] "good" [...] episode, but criticized its [...] "slow" [...] pacing.|$|E

500|$|Nick Offerman portrayed Ron Swanson, the {{director}} of the parks and recreation department, and Aubrey Plaza played April Ludgate, a sarcastic and uninterested college intern. [...] The part was written specifically for Plaza. After meeting her, [...] casting director Allison Jones told Schur, [...] "I just met the weirdest girl I've ever met in my life. You have to meet her and put her on your show." [...] Schur of meeting her, [...] "Aubrey came over to my office <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel really uncomfortable for like an hour, and immediately I wanted to put her in the show," [...] although the writers were not immediately sure what direction her character would take. Rounding out the main cast was Paul Schneider, best known for his work in independent films such as Lars and the Real Girl and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. He was cast as Mark Brendanawicz, a city planner and Leslie's unrequited love interest. She still harbors feelings for Mark from a one-night sexual encounter years ago. Schneider said that early in the season he was insecure in the role because he was {{still trying to figure out}} the character's motivations. Chris Pratt played Andy Dwyer, Ann's well-intentioned but lazy and simple-minded boyfriend. Although Pratt appeared in every episode of season 1, he was credited as guest star until the second season, when he was promoted to the main cast. Andy was originally supposed to appear only in the first season, but the producers liked Pratt so much that, almost immediately after casting him, they decided to make Andy a regular character if the show was renewed.|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} {{decided to keep}} {{publicity}} down during the recording of their fourth album, as the group was taken aback by such press surrounding Infinity on High. Sessions proved to {{be difficult for the}} band as Wentz started taking LSD when Zach Blair lead guitarist for Rise Against made him try it at a party in April 2008. The goal in Wentz using LSD was to hope it would influence his songwriting, but it just made him distracted from writing songs, which annoyed Stump, so he stopped using LSD in August 2008. Wentz later said he had taken LSD over 50 times. Stump called the making of the album [...] "painful", noting that he and Wentz quarreled over many issues, revealing [...] "I threw something across the room over a major-to-minor progression." [...] On previous albums, Trohman felt he and Hurley did not have enough musical freedom and that Stump and Wentz exerted too much control over the group: [...] "I felt, 'Man, this isn't my band anymore.' It's no one's fault, and I don't want to make it seem that way. It was more of a complex I developed based off of stuff I was reading. It's hard to hear, 'Joe and Andy are just along for the ride.'" [...] To amend the situation, Trohman sat down with Stump to communicate his concerns, which led to more collaboration on Folie à Deux. [...] "It made me feel like I owned the songs a lot more. It made me really excited about contributing to Fall Out Boy <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> find my role in the band," [...] Trohman recalled.|$|E
500|$|For the 1981 season, Ferrari {{introduced}} {{their first}} turbo engined F1 car, the 126C, which produced tremendous power but was let down by its poor handling. Villeneuve was partnered with Didier Pironi who noted that Villeneuve [...] "had a little family [...] {{but he made}} me welcome <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel at home overnight... treated me as an equal in every way." [...] Villeneuve won two races during the season. At the Spanish Grand Prix Villeneuve kept five quicker cars behind him {{for most of the}} race using the superior straight-line speed of his car. After an hour and 46 minutes of racing Villeneuve led second-placed Jacques Laffite by only 0.22 seconds. Fifth-placed Elio de Angelis was only just over a second further back. Harvey Postlethwaite, who was hired by Ferrari to design the follow-on and much more successful 126C2 that won the Constructors' Championship in 1982, later commented on the 126C: [...] "That car...had literally one quarter of the downforce that, say Williams or Brabham had. It had a power advantage over the Cosworths for sure, but it also had massive throttle lag at that time. In terms of sheer ability I think Gilles was on a different plane to the other drivers. To win those races, the 1981 GPs at Monaco and Jarama — on tight circuits — was quite out of this world. I know how bad that car was." [...] At the 1981 Canadian Grand Prix Villeneuve damaged the front wing of his Ferrari and drove for most of the race in heavy rain with the wing obscuring his view ahead. There was a risk of being black flagged but eventually the wing became detached and Villeneuve drove on to finish third with the nose section of his car missing.|$|E

500|$|The {{band members}} {{decided to keep}} {{publicity}} down during the album's recording, as they were taken aback by such press surrounding Infinity on High. Stump entered the studio with music for almost 50 songs. Folie à Deux {{was intended to be}} very different from the previous three Fall Out Boy albums, which were all interconnected musically and thematically; Stump described the new songs as [...] "having a lot of freedom [...] it's our first just plain old record in a while." [...] However, the sessions proved to be difficult for the band. Stump called the making of the album [...] "painful", noting that he and Wentz quarreled over many issues, revealing [...] "I threw something across the room over a major-to-minor progression."

2500|$|The onscreen {{pairing of}} Chad and Abigail became very popular among fans and {{garnered}} the squish name, [...] "Chabby".

[...] In Carmel, she notes that her friendship with muckraker Lincoln Steffens gave her [...] "...much deeper insight into the abuses of laborers and blue-collar workers <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> ready to work for liberal causes when I got to Hollywood a few years later." ...|$|E
2500|$|Neither Flatt nor Scruggs {{spoke to}} each other for the next ten years — until 1979 when Flatt was in the hospital. Scruggs made an unannounced visit to the bedside. The two men talked for more than an hour. Even though Flatt's voice was barely above a whisper, he spoke of a reunion. Scruggs {{answered}} yes, but told Flatt they would talk when he was better. [...] Flatt said, [...] "It came as quite a surprise <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel good". But Lester Flatt never recovered, and died May 11, 1979. [...] Historian Barry Willis, speaking of the meeting, said [...] "Earl gave Lester his flowers while he was still living".|$|E
2500|$|After giving birth, while resting {{near the}} trunk of a palm tree Jesus spoke to Mary from the cradle instructing her to shake the tree and obtain its fruits.

Blessed he has made me, {{wherever}} I may be; and He has enjoined me to pray, and to give alms, so long as I live and likewise to cherish my mother" [...] in order to dispel rumours of conception.

After seven matches for the club, Cole spent three months on loan at Burnley where he scored six goals for the Championship club, including a hat-trick against Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road. Reflecting on his time at Turf Moor, Cole stated, [...] "I went to Burnley and spoke to Owen Coyle and got a great vibe.

However, early Arab success gave way to an Israel military victory, and Ford sought to implement a peace among the belligerents.

"At (Cambridge) {{university}} I {{first became}} {{conscious of the}} creative role of politics in shaping human affairs, and I owe that mostly to my teachers Joan Robinson and Nicholas Kaldor.

She questioned me a great deal <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> think the unthinkable. She propounded the left wing interpretation of Keynes, maintaining that the state has to play more of a role {{if you really want to}} combine development with social equity.
