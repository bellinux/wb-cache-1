5|$|The {{most notable}} storms {{of the season}} were the five Category4 and Category5 hurricanes: Dennis, Emily, Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, along with the Category1 Hurricane Stan.

5|$|These {{birds are}} largely resident, and will only {{disperse}} beyond their range after mild winters. Carolina wrens sporadically breed {{as far north}} as Maine and Quebec after mild winters. In certain parts of their range, such as most of Iowa, prolonged periods of snow can curtail potential expansion. Permanent breeding locations range from eastern Nebraska, southern Michigan, southeast Ontario and the New England states to Mexican states such as Coahuila, Nuevo León, San Luis Potosí and Tamaulipas <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> Coast of the United States. Local occurrences with infrequent and likely breeding locations include southeast South Dakota, central Kansas, eastern Colorado, western Oklahoma and Texas as far as Maine and New Brunswick. There have been occasional vagrants spotted in Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona, Wyoming, South Dakota, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of St. Lawrence.|$|E
5|$|After the United States entered World War II, Pan Gulf {{frequently}} sailed in convoys on the North Atlantic, {{as well as}} some in the Caribbean <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico. Between April and September 1942, Pan Gulf {{made two}} roundtrips from the U.S. to Liverpool. In September, the cargo ship sailed from New York to the Caribbean to take on a load of bauxite in early November, and then sailed on to Galveston, Texas, before returning to New York in mid-February 1943.|$|E
5|$|An {{affluent}} 19th-century {{agricultural community}} {{of the same name}} established near the lakeside in the mid-19th century, but dwindled in status, becoming virtually abandoned {{in the aftermath of the}} American Civil War. It was strategically important during the early stages of the war, due to its proximity to fresh water <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico. After reaching its low point during the Great Depression, the lakeside community modestly rebounded in 1947 following the nearby discovery of oil. A fictional lake of the same name and with a similar history is featured in the 1998 novel Holes.|$|E

Tropical Storm warnings were issued for the Pacific coast of Nicaragua, El Salvador, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Fonseca on October 24. They were dropped the next day. Guatemala was placed under a warning on October 24. In addition, new flash flood and mudslide warnings were raised for Guatemala and the Mexican state of Chiapas on October 24 and 25, respectively. All warnings and watches were discontinued later on October 25 as Miriam {{turned away from}} the coast.|$|E

5|$|Marco Polo {{returned}} to Venice in 1295 with his fortune converted into gemstones. At this time, Venice was {{at war with}} the Republic of Genoa. Polo armed a galley equipped with a trebuchet to join the war. He was probably caught by Genoans in a skirmish in 1296, off the Anatolian coast between Adana <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Alexandretta and not during the battle of Curzola (September 1298), off the Dalmatian coast. The latter claim is due to a later tradition (16th Century) recorded by Giovanni Battista Ramusio.|$|E
5|$|On a {{strategic}} scale, a natural choke point was present between the northern shore of Lake Peipus <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Finland. The 45 kilometre wide {{strip of land}} was entirely bisected by the Narva River and had large areas of wilderness. The primary transportation routes, the Narva–Tallinn highway and railway, ran on an east-west axis near and parallel to the coastline. There were no other east-west transportation routes capable of sustaining troop movement {{on a large scale}} in the region.|$|E
5|$|Pinellas County lies on a {{peninsula}} between Tampa Bay <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico, {{and much}} of the city of Tampa lies on a smaller peninsula jutting out into Tampa Bay. This proximity to large bodies of water both moderates temperatures and introduces large amounts of humidity into the atmosphere. In general, the local communities farthest from the coast have larger temperature ranges, both during a single day and throughout the seasons of the year.|$|E

50|$|The region {{also has}} a rich history as a {{commercial}} fishery. However, the data vary wildly according to the species being studied, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf's</b> ability to recuperate after years of overfishing remains uncertain.
