40|$|Reviewed in {{this article}} is {{research}} on children with reactive attachment disorder (RAD) who exhibit specific patterns of socially aberrant behavior resulting from being maltreated or having limited opportunities to form selective attachments. There are no data explaining why 2 different patterns ofthe disorder, an emotionally withdrawn-inhibited pattern and an indiscriminate-disinhibited pattern, arise from similarly aberrant environments. In this article, we consider whether temperamental differences might contribute to the different manifestations of reactive attachment disorder (RAD) in the context of adverse environments. Although the association between attachment and temperament has been studied extensively and {{has been the subject of}} spirited debate within the field of child development, there are no extant data on the influence of temperament on the development of attachment disorders. We consider possible directions for research efforts designed to explore the biological underpinnings ofthe complex phenomenon of attachment disorders. Though considered rare, reports of behaviors now thought to reflect clinical disorders of <b>attachment</b> <b>date</b> back at least to the mid- 20 th century (see Spitz, 1945). Further, there is a general consensus that the disorders describe patterns of aberrant behaviors not well described by other disorders (Richters & Volkmar, 1994). Of particular interest for this special issue is that attachment disorders are defined in both the Diagnosti...|$|E

40|$|DOI: 10. 1007 /s 11469 - 011 - 9321 -xOne of {{the most}} salient {{developmental}} tasks of adolescence is the entry into romantic relationship, which often involves developing attachments to partners. Adolescents {{with a history of}} maltreatment {{have been found to be}} at greater risk of insecure attachments to romantic partners than non-maltreated adolescents, and the interaction of maltreatment and insecure attachment style has been linked to dating violence. The current study examined <b>attachment</b> styles and <b>dating</b> violence in child welfare-involved adolescents with borderline-to-mild intellectual disability (n = 40) and with average IQ (n = 116). Despite reporting similar experiences of childhood maltreatment, IQ was found to interact with avoidant attachment style to predict the degree of dating violence victimization and perpetration experienced by youth. It is suggested that an avoidant attachment style is a risk factor for all maltreated youth, and holds a particularly strong effect on youth with lower IQ levels. These findings highlight the need for developmentally appropriate <b>attachment</b> and <b>dating</b> violence interventions for maltreated youth.

The main goal {{of this study was to}} test a mediational model of dating violence risk factors. The sample was composed of 477 secondary and college students from Spain (59 % females). A dynamic developmental explanatory model considering aggressiveness, insecure attachment, interparental conflict, and peer dating violence was tested using a multigroup structural equation model. Aggressiveness partially mediated the relation between anxious <b>attachment</b> and <b>dating</b> violence and fully mediated the association between interparental conflict resolution and dating violence. Furthermore, perceived peer dating violence was a direct predictor of dating violence. Implications for prevention and intervention plans are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} used survey {{methodology}} {{to investigate the}} relationships among child sexual abuse, adult <b>attachment,</b> risky <b>dating</b> behaviors, and sexual assault.

Results indicate that child sexual abuse relates to attachment anxiety but not to avoidance or the dating behaviors studied.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, {{attachment}} theory has taken on increased significance in academic and professional discourse, particularly {{in the field of}} child welfare. While this appears to be a relatively new area of interest in social work, the history of <b>attachment</b> theory <b>dates</b> back over five decades. This thesis aims to identify some of the reasons behind the resurgence of attachment theory, in particular, in child welfare practice. This renewed interest in attachment theory is tied to the current social climate and context for social work practice. This context, it is argued, contributes to the tendency for attachment theory to become a tool of social control. The thesis concludes by exploring how attachment theory might be used instead as a means to empower families in relationship-based social work...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore how {{supportive}} functions of parent-child relationships influence young adult dating motivations and involvement. Theoretical literature suggests that emotionally supportive homes provide a secure base for children to depend on as they explore themselves and other relationships.

40|$|Apparel {{manufacturing}} in the 19 th-century United States has received attention from few researchers (Kahn, 1989; Kidwell & Christman, 1974).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new untraceable {{electronic}} cash scheme which makes it possible for a payer to attach the desired date to his electronic cash during a transaction. With the aid of the date attachability property, the date on which an electronic cash is deposited in the bank cannot be forged in an electronic cash scheme. It is conducive to the unforgeability of the number of days for which the cash has been stored in the bank for some necessary purposes such as interest calculation. Our scheme not only keeps the attached date from being forged but also avoids two or more different dates being attached to the same electronic cash. Furthermore, the <b>date</b> <b>attachment</b> does not affect the untraceability property of electronic cash. Comparing with typical electronic cash schemes, the extra computation required for date attach...|$|R
40|$|The {{attachment}} and sexual systems operate jointly across partners to affect relationship outcomes. In the present longitudinal investigation of newly dating couples, we tested a dual deactivation hypothesis of relationship dissatisfaction. According to this hypothesis, individuals whose sexual system is chronically deactivated {{are expected to}} experience low relationship satisfaction early in their relationships. Their satisfaction should increase with time, but only if their partners are low in <b>attachment</b> avoidance. Newly <b>dating</b> couples (2 – 4 months; N 62) completed three waves of individual measures of {{attachment and}} sexual deactivation and relationship satisfaction in 4 -month intervals. Dyadic growth curves showed that sexual deactivation was negatively associated with relationship satisfaction {{in the beginning of}} the relationship. This negative effect gradually disappeared among individuals whose partners were low in attachment avoidance, but persisted among individuals with avoidantly attached partners. These findings suggest that attachment processes can compensate for sexual difficulties...|$|R

In this thesis I investigated two of these information sources, namely overt prosodic features and plausibility constraints.

Much research has explored the single cues and much is know about the influence that each cue exerts independent of the other. However, the interaction of prosodic and semantic cues to <b>attachment</b> has to <b>date</b> received little attention. Two experimental paradigms were used in 4 experiments, i. e. the method of structural priming and the online method of event‐related potentials. The data from these experiments suggest that the cues interact in a complex way.

This study hypothesized {{that the effects of}} empathy on relationship quality could be either positive or negative, depending on an individual 2 ̆ 7 s <b>attachment</b> style. Fifty-nine <b>dating</b> couples were videotaped while attempting to resolve the most important problem facing their relationship. After the discussion, couples reviewed the videotapes using the Ickes, Stinson, Bissonnette, 2 ̆ 6 Garcia (1990) empathic accuracy procedure. Measures of empathic accuracy were collected for thoughts, positive emotions, and negative emotions. As expected, there was no direct relationship between empathic accuracy and relationship quality. Instead, attachment avoidance, gender, and empathic accuracy for thoughts interacted when predicting relationship quality. Results showed that the effects of empathy and attachment avoidance were opposite for males and females. There was also a two-way interaction between attachment avoidance and empathic accuracy for positive emotions when predicting relationship quality. Results support the contention that individual as well as gender differences qualify the effects of empathic accuracy in romantic relationships. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Psychology: Academic Research, 2015 Together, {{stress and}} social {{relationships}} {{are thought to}} play key roles in health and development (Keller et al., 2012; Umberson & Montez, 2010). With a greater understanding for how one???s relationship qualities interact with their stress response systems, we may begin {{to take a more}} clearly focused approach to mental health treatment. This study examined the differences in stress management using and fourcategory model of <b>attachment.</b> To <b>date</b> there is limited research examining the links between stress response and the attachment system. The current study assessed both perceived psychological stress and physiological measures of stress exposure in response to a social stressor, utilizing the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST; Kirschbaum et al., 1993) as a means to induce acute social stress within a laboratory setting. The current study furthered past research by exploring the relationship between adult attachment styles (secure, avoidant, anxious and fearful) and stress. Past research has failed to evaluate the fearful attachment style. The results indicated that attachment styles act as either a risk or a protective factor for the stress response, such that participants who were classified as fearfully attached {{were more likely to have}} elevated levels of perceived stress (measured as trait anxiety and acute stress response). The secure and anxiously attached participants had similar levels of perceived stress, raising some questions about the view of an anxious attachment as being a negative quality, or the utility of a secure attachment style for adequate stress management. The avoidantly attached participants had similarly elevated levels of trait anxiety found within the fearful group, suggesting that the avoidant tendency to reject social support may partially explain this poor stress management...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT – Background and Objectives: Individual {{differences}} in vulnerability to suici-dal ideation have been recently addressed to internal working models of <b>attachment.</b> Howev-er, to <b>date,</b> research has mainly focused on adolescents. Few studies {{have investigated the}} role of adult attachment and personality dimensions in suicidal ideation, either examined from a mediational perspective. In this study, we aimed at testing a theoretical model in which Self/other perception mediates between personality and suicidal ideation in young adults. Methods: Dimensions of Attachment (self/other perception), Personality (the Big Five factor model), and Suicidal Ideation (hopelessness and depression) were assessed in a community sample of 319 young adults from Northern Italy. Structural Equation Model-ing and mediation analysis were conducted. Controlling for demographic variables (i. e., gender, age, education, and job), we tested three structural models. Results: The final model confirmed our hypothesis that self/other perception mediates between personality (high neuroticism and low extraversion) and suicidal ideation, pro-viding excellent fit to data. Conclusions: In line with the conceptual framework of the Attachment Theory, find-ings suggest that failure to resolve attachment-related distress {{is related to the}} emergence of negative self/other models in adults. Such internal models are likely to attenuate the as-sociation between neuroticism and extraversion with depressive symptoms, hopelessness and suicidal ideation...|$|R
40|$|Romantic love {{relationships}} {{are among the}} most endlessly fascinating, yet frustratingly complex, parts of life: inspiring more art, literature, and music than any other topic. Making sense of how and why romantic relationships function the way they do is, therefore, a research endeavour at once most rewarding and yet never-ending. Why do some relationships sail through everything that life throws at them, when others flounder at the first hiccup? Why does one friend experience drama after tumultuous drama with each new boyfriend, when another can’t trust or open up to anyone enough to get beyond a second <b>date?</b> <b>Attachment</b> theory (Bowlby, 1969, 1973, 1980) draws on clinical, developmental, social, personality, and cognitive psychology and provides a rich theoretical framework for examining and answering such perennial questions. Although it was developed originally in the context of infants and their caregivers, in recent decades the theory has also provided insight into the development and functioning of romantic relationships. This chapter describes romantic relationship processes from an attachment perspective. We highlight in particular the cognitive models of self and others that form a person’s attachment pattern or orientation. These models colour the lens with which he or she views the self and the social world, and in turn underlie individual differences in romantic relationship functioning...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Mechanisms {{of early}} stone {{retention}} in the kidney are under studied and poorly understood. To <b>date</b> <b>attachment</b> via Randall plaque {{is the only}} widely accepted theory in this regard, which is best described in idiopathic calcium oxalate stone formers. Brushite stone formers {{are known to have}} distinct papillary morphology relative to calcium oxalate stone formers. As such we sought to determine whether stone attachment mechanisms in such patients may be similarly unique. Materials and Methods Patients undergoing percutaneous and or ureteroscopic procedures for stone removal consented to endoscopic renal papillary examination and individual stone collection. Each removed stone was processed using micro computerized tomography to assess the 3 -dimensional microstructure and the minerals contained, and search for common structural features indicative of novel mechanisms of early growth and attachment to renal tissue. Results A total of 25 intact brushite stones were removed from 8 patients and analyzed. Video confirmed attachment of 13 of the 25 stones with the remainder believed to have been accidently dislodged during the procedure. Microscopic examination by light and computerized tomography failed to show evidence of Randall plaque associated with any stone containing brushite. Conversely each brushite stone demonstrated microstructural evidence of having grown attached to a ductal plug formed of apatite. Conclusions Three-dimensional analysis of small brushite stones suggests overgrowth on ductal apatite plugs as a mechanism of early stone growth and retention. Such findings represent what is to our knowledge the initial supporting evidence for a novel mechanism of stone formation which has previously been hypothesized but never verified...|$|R
40|$|The ultra-high risk (UHR) {{criteria}} were defined to identify young people at high and imminent {{risk of developing}} a first episode of psychosis. Identifying UHR individuals presents the opportunity for preventing the onset of a full psychotic disorder, {{or at least the}} possibility of reducing patient’s disability. The link between insecure attachment and the risk for developing psychosis has been explained by the alterations of specific neurobiological pathways. Some studies also underlined the role of mentalization processes in moderating the risk of transition to psychotic disorders. Nevertheless, to <b>date,</b> <b>attachment</b> and mentalization in UHR population have not been studied using “golden standard” measures. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the quality of attachment representations, mentalization capacity and childhood traumatic experiences among UHR adolescence outpatients. 21 UHR adolescent outpatients were compared with 33 other who did not meet the ultra-high risk criteria. Each patient was evaluated with M. I. N. I., Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes (SIPS) and Scale for Prodromal Symptoms (SOPS). During the first month of treatment the Adult Attachment Interview was also administered, and the AAI transcripts were assessed by the RF Scale. Although no differences between groups with respect to self-reported childhood traumatic experiences have been found, UHR patients showed a higher degree of “Unresolved” and “Cannot Classify” attachment patterns. Moreover, the RF scores were significantly lower in the UHR sample and significant negative correlations between RF and two SOPS’ subscales, “Suspiciousness/Persecutory Ideas” and “Expression of Emotion” were found. Our results underline the importance of taking both disorganized attachment and mentalization impairment into consideration when treating psychotic prodromal symptomatology...|$|R
40|$|According to {{attachment}} theory, {{the infant}} shapes perceptions on self and significant others {{based on his}} or her experience with the primary caregiver. These perceptions include thoughts and beliefs regards {{the extent to which the}} self is worthy of love, and the extent to which others are reliable sources of love and protection. Thoughts and beliefs about the self are defined as working models of self, thoughts and belief about others are defined as working models of others. To <b>date,</b> <b>attachment</b> researchers have characterized individual differences in working models predominantly in terms of valence (positive versus negative). However, there are both theoretical and empirical reasons to suggest that it may not be sufficient, and that working models also differ between individuals in terms of stability and organizational structure. Accordingly, the current thesis investigated the proposal that individual differences in attachment relates to change in working models, in specific models of significant others, in response to transient evaluative events. Five studies examined the association between individual differences in attachment and systematic fluctuations in appraisals of significant others (romantic partners), and the psychological processes that underlie them. Study 1 showed that people with high levels of attachment anxiety hold unstable views of their romantic partners. Study 2 and Study 3 provided evidence that under threat to the ego or threat to the relationship people with high levels of attachment anxiety decrease esteem for their romantic partner. In Study 4 and Study 5 higher levels of attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance were both associated with greater ambivalence towards the romantic partner. Overall, findings supported the proposal that working models of attachment differ not only in terms of how positively or negatively others are perceived, but also in terms of the temporal stability of these perceptions. These findings have implications for research in the domains of attachment and romantic relationships, and on romantic relationships' functioning<br/...|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} study, {{relations}} between {{risk factors of}} dating violence perpetration and victimization were assessed at the couple-level. Attachment style and emotion regulation are among various factors that {{have been associated with}} dating violence and were recently included in an empirically-based model of bi-directional couple violence model (Langhinrichsen-Rohling, 2005 / 2010). This study was designed to assess the following research questions: (a) Does attachment style predict individuals’ abilities to regulate their emotions?; (b) Does attachment style predict individuals’ own, as well as their partners’, reports of dating violence?; (c) Does ability to regulate emotions predict individuals’ own, as well as their partners’, reports of dating violence?; (d) Is emotion regulation a mechanism through which attachment style relates to individuals’ own, as well as their partners’, reports of dating violence?; and (e) Are higher levels of dating violence more likely to occur among couples for whom both partners report emotion regulation difficulties? Participants (158 heterosexual dating couples; N = 316) completed online measures of attachment style, emotion regulation, and dating violence. Using the actor-partner interdependence model (Kenny, Kashy, 2 ̆ 6 Cook, 2006), results from multilevel models indicated that insecure attachment was associated with increased difficulty regulating emotions and difficulty regulating emotions was associated with dating violence perpetration and victimization. However, findings were mixed regarding the relation between <b>attachment</b> style and <b>dating</b> violence, and many models revealed significant interactions with participants’ sex. Although mediation hypotheses were not supported in this study, {{it is possible that the}} proposed mediation is moderated by sex. Finally, the hypothesis that couples would report increased dating violence if both member s had difficulties regulating their emotions was not supported. In fact, results suggested that sex-specific differences in emotion regulation abilities may actually increase risk. Future research should strive to conceptualize and evaluate separate models for men and women or collect data from samples large enough to conduct complex dyadic moderated-mediation analyses. Overall, both attachment style and emotion regulation appear to play important roles in predicting both perpetration and victimization and continued research is warranted...|$|R
