"Circumstances," [...] {{he wrote}} in the Rough Draft of a New Model at Sea, [...] "must come in and are to be made a part of the matter of which we are to judge; {{positive}} decisions are always dangerous, more especially in politics." [...] Nor was he the mere literary student buried in books and in contemplative ease. He had none of the [...] "indecisiveness which commonly renders literary men of no use in the world." [...] The constant tendency of his mind towards antithesis and the balancing of opinions did not lead to paralysis in time of action [...] - [...] he did not shrink from responsibility, nor show on any occasion lack of courage. At various times of crisis he proved himself a great leader. He returned to public life to defeat the Exclusion Bill. At the Glorious Revolution Halifax seized the reins of government and maintained public security. His subsequent failure in collaborating with William is disappointing, but the cause has not received sufficient <b>attention.</b> <b>Party</b> government had come to the birth during the struggles over the Exclusion Bill, and there had been unconsciously introduced into politics a novel element of which the nature and importance were not understood or suspected. Halifax had consistently ignored and neglected party; and it now had its revenge. Detested by the Whigs and by the Tories alike, and defended by neither, the favour alone of the king and his own transcendent abilities proved insufficient to withstand the constant and violent attacks made upon him in parliament, and he yielded to the superior force. He seems indeed himself to have been at last convinced of the necessity in English political life of party government, for though in his cautions to electors he warns them against men [...] "tied to a party," [...] yet in his last words he declares: [...] "If there are two parties a man ought to adhere to that which he disliked least though in the whole he doth not approve it; for whilst he doth not list himself in one or the other party, he is looked upon as such a straggler that he is fallen upon by both[...] [...] [...] Happy those that are convinced so as to be of the general opinions." ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{addresses}} a key knowledge-gap by exploring {{the role of}} electoral politics in shaping public policy on the arts. Analysis of the prioritisation and use of language in party manifestos in state-wide and regional elections in the UK reveals that over recent decades {{there has been a}} sharp increase in the <b>attention</b> <b>parties</b> give to arts policy as they compete for the political centre-ground. It also shows how the framing of arts policy has broadened from an initial concern with social policy objectives to emphasise economic benefits and boosting international standing. However, parties have generally failed to advance comprehensive arts strategies raising accountability issues in relation to future government policy. Against the backdrop of a global trend of state restructuring, the analysis reveals how devolution is leading to the territorialisation of policy – as framing is contingent on ‘regional’ party politics, including nation-building by civic nationalist parties...|$|R
5000|$|... "Slow Down Gandhi" [...] is {{a single}} by rapper Sage Francis from his second album A Healthy Distrust. The song was written before the 2004 Presidential Election in an effort [...] "to call out fly-by-night activists who pretend to be {{involved}} with actual change until the media <b>attention</b> and <b>parties</b> die out." [...] The song is featured on Incorporated, an album by mash-up group Legion of Doom.|$|R
5000|$|The Beer and Bicycle Race {{was a team}} {{biathlon}} event {{from the}} 1950s and '60s, briefly revived in the '70s. The first race, in 1952, staged by the Trumbull Beer and Bike Society, was an over 70-mile relay from Trumbull to Vassar College. Riders had to consume a quart of beer before passing the baton to the next member of their team (although some sources suggest the beer had to be consumed before riding). Prizes were awarded for fastest times and best rider costumes. The annual April event {{became the center of}} press <b>attention,</b> <b>partying,</b> and celebration, and grew to the point that authorities at Vassar banned it in 1957. It continued for a while with a new destination, Connecticut College. In 1964, Trumbull ran it on a 45-mile course through nearby towns, ending back at the Yale Bowl. It seems to have faded away after that, although Trumbull re-staged it for a few years in the 1970s as a double round-trip race between Trumbull and Sleeping Giant State Park.|$|R

5000|$|The {{affirmation}} of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics as a [...] "system" [...] (zhidu) was {{written into the}} party constitution for the first time. The [...] "construction of ecological civilization" [...] (shengtai wenming) as a major goal of the party was also written into the party constitution, an extension from the previous version of the constitution which included economic, political, cultural, and social realms; this ostensibly increased the <b>attention</b> the <b>party</b> intended {{to focus on the}} environment.|$|R
25|$|New York was {{the birthplace}} of other dance forms, as well. Breakdance became an {{influential}} street dance style that emerged {{as part of the}} Hip Hop Movement in African-American and Puerto Rican communities in the South Bronx in the early 1970s. It is arguably the best known of all hip hop dance styles. Popular speculations of the early 1980s suggest that breakdancing, in its organized fashion seen today, began as a method for rival gangs of the ghetto to mediate and settle territorial disputes. In a turn-based showcase of dance routines, the winning side was determined by the dancers who could outperform the other by displaying a set of more complicated and innovative moves. It later was through the highly energetic performances of the late funk legend James Brown and the rapid growth of dance teams, like the Rock Steady Crew of the Bronx, that the competitive ritual of gang warfare evolved into a pop-culture phenomenon receiving massive media <b>attention.</b> <b>Parties,</b> disco clubs, talent shows, and other public events became typical locations for breakdancers, including gang members for whom dancing served as a positive diversion from the threats of city life.|$|R
40|$|The article centres on the {{saliency}} that regional decentralization has had for British, Italian, and French {{political parties}} in the last sixty years. A longitudinal analysis of the emphasis that parties have assigned to this issue in their manifestos confirms the hypothesis that some environmental factors influence the changes of <b>attention</b> of <b>parties</b> on regionalization in their electoral discourse. Electoral threats and institutional reforms notably have a relevant impact and are mediated {{by the nature of}} party goals (policy, vote or office-seeking) ...|$|R

50|$|In September 1981 Šešelj {{rejoined the}} Faculty of Political Sciences {{where he was}} asked to teach courses on {{international}} relations. The Faculty of Political Sciences, as a breeding ground for future politicians, was closely controlled and overseen by the Communist Party, and outspoken Šešelj quickly drew the <b>attention</b> of <b>party</b> officials. He openly supported another prominent young intellectual, Nenad Kecmanović, who was himself embroiled in a controversy that drew criticism from some sections of the communist nomenklatura in Bosnia due to his writings in NIN magazine.|$|R
50|$|Charles Beauclerk, Earl of Burford, {{stood as}} its {{candidate}} in the November 1999 Kensington and Chelsea by-election against Michael Portillo, receiving 189 votes (0.9%). The party decided not to stand any candidates in the 2001 general election, citing a lack of media <b>attention.</b> The <b>party</b> criticised the United Kingdom Independence Party in 2000 for being perceived as right-wing, lacking political acumen, and performing poorly in Westminster elections. In 2003 the party took legal action against the UK government in the High Court over the then proposed EU Constitution.|$|R
500|$|On March 9, 2012, [...] "Project M" [...] {{became the}} first event to gain media <b>attention</b> after a <b>party</b> invite was posted on Twitter by Farmington Hills, Michigan high schooler Mikey Vasovski, and was {{subsequently}} passed to thousands of users, {{to the point that}} the message was being resent once per second, and was posted on Craigslist. The party was dubbed [...] "Project M" [...] by Vasovski, and the invite contained the address of a foreclosed home where the party would take place. By 9 a.m. on March 9, potential party-goers began arriving at the location, but by 11 a.m. the party had been officially cancelled after police began escorting people off of the premises. [...] Based on his promotion job, Vasovski was offered a summer internship by Gawker Media. On March 10, 2012, a second <b>party</b> gained media <b>attention.</b> The <b>party</b> was organized by a Canadian student, titled [...] "Project Kris". Within 24 hours, it had been viewed by over 900,000 people. The event was allegedly intended to be a small party for 30.|$|R

50|$|Friends of Beer Party (Czech: Strana Přátel Piva, {{abbreviated}} SPP) was {{a political}} party in the Czech Republic. Originally intended as a humorous commentary on {{the large number of}} new political parties, the party decided to run in the elections after receiving public <b>attention.</b> The <b>party</b> reached its peak in 1992 when it received 1.3%, but still failed to reach the threshold. The party merged with the Czech Social Democratic Party in 1998, and former members of the party created a Friends of Beer Club within ČSSD. The SPP now continues its activities as the Friends of Beer Association.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the earlier}} {{coverage}} in the Los Angeles Times, the controversy achieved national attention in September of 2016 with the announcement by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that the bank would be fined for the practice. Wells Fargo was fined $185 million for the illegal activity. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau received $100 million, the Los Angeles City Attorney received $50 million, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency received the last $35 million.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{substantive}} representation of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people in party manifestos in general elections and regional {{elections in the}} United Kingdom, 1945 – 2011. The findings show that while {{there is some evidence}} of progress, there is also significant variation in the <b>attention</b> that <b>parties</b> afford to LGBT issues, and a general failure to fully apply international principles and mainstreaming theory in election programmes. It is argued that an 'asymmetrical electoral bargain' applies: parties increasingly court LGBT voters yet often do so in a reductive and limited manner. This suggests that elements of institutionally homophobic practice endure in contemporary electoral politics...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which the highly diverse and volatile Dutch electorate received a diverse offer of political newspaper coverage during the 2006 general election campaign. We measured the level of diversity of five subscription based national newspapers with a partisan history and two free dailies. Two forms of diversity were examined: party diversity (i. e., the distribution of <b>attention</b> to political <b>parties)</b> and issue diversity (i. e., the distribution of attention to issues). The diversity of party coverage in the free dailies was greater than the diversity across all newspapers. Whereas free dailies paid a relatively large amount of attention to new and opposition parties, traditional newspapers paid a relatively large amount of <b>attention</b> to the <b>parties</b> with whom they were aligned during the period of "pillarization". Conversely, we only found small differences in the distribution of attention to issues. The diversity of issue coverage across newspapers was larger than the diversity within newspapers. © 2010 Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co. KG...|$|R
