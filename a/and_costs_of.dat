A representative from the Health and Safety Executive said that inadequate procedures were {{to blame for the}} fact that nothing had been done to alert staff or passengers that the ride would be dangerous to use. The pier management came into criticism from Brighton and Hove City Council, who thought they were relying too much on fairground rides, some of which were being built too high.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{estimate}} the equity beta <b>and</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital of Japanese property liability insurance companies. For this, we obtain the overall equity beta <b>and</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital for each company and then estimate the equity beta <b>and</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital by the business lines. To obtain a companys overall equity beta, {{we use the}} one-factor capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and the three-factor Fama-French (FF) model. To estimate each business lines equity beta, we use the full-information industry beta (FIB) methodology. Econometric analysis reveals that the CAPM and FF models are well suited to estimating Japanese property-liability insurance companies the equity beta <b>and</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital. Furthermore, by using the FIB methodology, we find that each the equity beta of each business line is different. ...|$|R
5|$|In October and November 2004, the IOC {{established}} an Olympic Programme Commission, which was tasked with reviewing the sports on the Olympic programme and all non-Olympic recognised sports. The {{goal was to}} apply a systematic approach to establishing the Olympic programme for each celebration of the Games. The commission formulated seven criteria to judge whether a sport should be included on the Olympic programme. These criteria are history and tradition of the sport, universality, popularity of the sport, image, athletes' health, development of the International Federation that governs the sport, <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> holding the sport. From this study five recognised sports emerged as candidates for inclusion at the 2012 Summer Olympics: golf, karate, rugby union, roller sports and squash. These sports were reviewed by the IOC Executive Board and then referred to the General Session in Singapore in July 2005. Of the five sports recommended for inclusion only two were selected as finalists: karate and squash. Neither sport attained the required two-thirds vote and consequently they were not promoted to the Olympic programme. In October 2009 the IOC voted to instate golf and rugby union as Olympic sports for the 2016 and 2020 Summer Olympic Games.|$|E

Prior to treatment PTSD patients overestimated the probability <b>and</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> all types of traumatic events occurring relative to non-patients, and overestimated the probability <b>and</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the specific type of traumatic event {{that they had been}} traumatized by relative to the anxious controls as well as non-patients. These judgment biases were specific to traumatic events and did not generalise to all negative events. PTSD patients’ estimations <b>of</b> the probability <b>and</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> traumatic events were significantly reduced following treatment, and were no longer significantly different from those of non-patients. Results suggest that patients with PTSD show specific judgment biases in the estimation <b>of</b> probability <b>and</b> <b>cost,</b> which can be successfully modified by cognitive therapy...|$|R
