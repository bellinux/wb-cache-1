5|$|Although the Egyptians {{believed}} their gods {{to be present}} in the world <b>around</b> <b>them,</b> contact between the human and divine realms was mostly limited to specific circumstances. In literature, gods may appear to humans in a physical form, but in real life the Egyptians were limited to more indirect means of communication.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{aforementioned}} anti-cheating protocols, some participants {{felt that this}} was merely a display without effect. Mobile phones were commonly heard going off, particularly in the entourage of FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov. It was also regarded as fairly easy to circumvent the initial metal detectors simply by passing an object <b>around</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|Feral zerg are zerg {{not under}} the control of any higher entity. These zerg will simply devolve into predatory behavior: acting on the lowest {{intellectual}} level, consuming other animals for nourishment, attack everything <b>around</b> <b>them.</b> Control can be re-asserted over feral zerg by a Broodmother or other command strains however.|$|E

5|$|The {{formation}} of planetesimals {{is the biggest}} unsolved problem in the nebular disk model. How 1cm sized particles coalesce into 1km planetesimals is a mystery.

5|$|Written by Dennis Spooner, {{this story}} was to be {{concerned}} with a planet where drugs in the food and water are used to control the populace. Punishment would be meted out by temporary withdrawal from the drugs which would cause people to see monsters all <b>around</b> <b>them.</b> The storyline for the four-part story was commissioned on 31 January 1975 and the full scripts on 4 February 1975.|$|E
5|$|All sharks {{need to keep}} {{water flowing}} over their gills {{in order for them}} to breathe, however not all species need to be moving to do this. Those that are able to breathe while not {{swimming}} do so by using their spiracles to force water over their gills, thereby allowing them to extract oxygen from the water. It has been recorded that their eyes remain open while in this state and actively follow the movements of divers swimming <b>around</b> <b>them</b> and as such they are not truly asleep.|$|E

5|$|Andean cocks-of-the-rocks {{influence}} the environment <b>around</b> <b>them.</b> It {{was found that}} a white-capped dipper renovated an abandoned cock-of-the-rock nest to lay its eggs in. Cock-of-the-rocks also change the surrounding flora through seed dispersal. Seeds that the birds ingest often are found deposited around lek and nesting sites. This favours the germination and growth of those seeds. The diversity {{of these types of}} seeds {{has been found to be}} increased at lek and nests and decreased throughout the surrounding forest.|$|E
5|$|At the mansion, Mona knocks Max to {{the ground}} in an attempt to follow her orders to kill him, but discovers that her {{feelings}} for him keep her from doing so. Lem then shoots Mona, after realizing that she will not kill Max. Woden confronts Lem, who shoots him to death in the ensuing struggle. Max and Lem then fight while the mansion burns <b>around</b> <b>them.</b> Eventually, Lem is killed and Max returns to Mona's side as the police arrive, and she dies in his arms. In an alternate ending unlocked on the highest difficulty, Mona survives her wound, and the two share a kiss.|$|E

5|$|Beagles are {{intelligent}} but, as {{a result}} of being bred for the long chase, are single-minded and determined, which can make them hard to train. They can be difficult to recall once they have picked up a scent, and are easily distracted by smells <b>around</b> <b>them.</b> They do not generally feature in obedience trials; while they are alert, respond well to food-reward training, and are eager to please, they are easily bored or distracted. They are ranked 72nd in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, as Coren places them among the group with the lowest degree of working/obedience intelligence. Coren's scale, however, does not assess understanding, independence, or creativity.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{navigation}} being closed, {{a guide to}} Midhurst published in 1895 advertised that skiffs could be hired, and fishing could be enjoyed. The boats were hired out by a plumber called William Port, and his business continued to prosper until 1912, when his boathouse burned down. Rowing boats were also available for hire at Coultershaw and Fittleworth. Another book called A New Oarsman's Guide, published in 1896, suggested that the river could be canoed from Iping to the Arun, a distance of , when there was sufficient water. By that time, none of the locks were workable, and boats had to be carried <b>around</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

Much of the estate was sold in 1987 to the Avon Wildlife Trust who established their Folly Farm nature reserve on the site.|$|E

5|$|E. rabborum was {{remarkable}} {{in that the}} males appeared to provide nutrition to the tadpoles directly. During the day, the males backed into the tadpole-filled water of the tree holes and remained in that half-submerged state until night. During this time, the tadpoles swam <b>around</b> <b>them,</b> rasping small pieces of skin from their fathers' backs and eating them. This was the first observed instance of any frog species doing this, though it {{was similar to the}} way some female caecilians feed their young.|$|E

Heimdall alerts Thor that Jane has moved beyond his near all-seeing vision, leading Thor to Earth. When Thor finds Jane, she inadvertently releases an unearthly force, and Thor returns with her to Asgard. Odin, recognizing the Aether, warns that the Aether will not only kill Jane, but that its return heralds a catastrophic prophecy.|$|E
