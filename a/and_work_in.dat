5|$|As {{a working-class}} woman, Anning was an {{outsider}} {{to the scientific}} community. At the time in Britain women {{were not allowed to}} vote, hold public office, or attend university. The newly formed, but increasingly influential Geological Society of London did not allow women to become members, or even to attend meetings as guests. The only occupations generally open to working-class women were farm labour, domestic service, <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> the newly opening factories.|$|E
5|$|Markos Varvaris is {{a plastic}} surgeon from the Greek island of Tinos.

5|$|The Public Faroese Health School (Faroese: Heilsuskúli Føroya) in Suðuroy is a {{vocational}} school offering {{two types of}} education. The health care assistant education (Heilsuhjálpari) takes fifteen months. Following graduation, pupils can choose to leave the school <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> home care and retirement homes. Alternatively they can continue with another 22 months and become an assistant nurse (heilsurøktari). The assistant nurse can work in various places, mostly in retirement homes or hospitals. The graduates from the Health School are mainly women. In 2012 almost 90% of the School's graduates were women.|$|E
5|$|The West Virginia portion {{was under}} {{construction}} by 1976, <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> both states {{was completed by}} 1983. The three-level diamond interchange on the eastern banks of the Ohio River {{was said to be}} the most complex interchange in West Virginia at the time of construction by the WVDOH spokesman Gary Chernenko. The opening of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge, along with another bridge in nearby Moundsville was thought to have reduced the amount of traffic, and thus tolls collected by the nearby Bellaire Bridge by up to 50 per cent in 1987.|$|E
5|$|The prosperous {{industry}} {{which had}} sprung {{up around the}} new iron industry required vast numbers of largely unskilled workers to mine ironstone <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> the blast furnace plants. Coatbridge therefore became a popular destination for vast numbers of Irish (especially from County Donegal in Ulster) arriving in Scotland. The iron bars and plates produced in Coatbridge iron works were the raw materials needed throughout the British Empire for railways, construction, bridge building and shipbuilding. One example of uses Coatbridge' iron was put to included armour plating for British ships fighting in the Crimean War.|$|E

5|$|The small landowner-cultivators {{formed the}} {{majority}} of the Han tax base; this revenue was threatened during the latter half of Eastern Han when many peasants fell into debt and were forced to work as farming tenants for wealthy landlords. The Han government enacted reforms in order to keep small landowner-cultivators out of debt and on their own farms. These reforms included reducing taxes, temporary remissions of taxes, granting loans and providing landless peasants temporary lodging <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> agricultural colonies until they could recover from their debts.|$|E

If you want to pass a law that says one individual is in government, then none of their friends or relatives can work in government, then you should pass that law.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Oppenheimer became {{chairman}} of the influential General Advisory Committee of the newly created United States Atomic Energy Commission. He used that position to lobby for international control of nuclear power to avert nuclear proliferation and a nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union. After provoking the ire of many politicians with his outspoken opinions during the Second Red Scare, he suffered the revocation of his security clearance in a much-publicized hearing in 1954, and was effectively stripped of his direct political influence; he continued to lecture, write <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> physics. Nine years later, President John F. Kennedy awarded (and Lyndon B. Johnson presented) him with the Enrico Fermi Award {{as a gesture of}} political rehabilitation.|$|E

5|$|Beilhart {{was born}} in Ohio {{and raised in the}} Lutheran faith. He moved to Kansas when he was 18 and embraced Seventh-day Adventism. He later {{attended}} college to become a licensed preacher. Eventually, Beilhart came to believe that it was more important to put faith into practice helping others so he left preaching to study nursing <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> a sanitarium. He returned to Ohio in 1899 to start the Spirit Fruit Society, an intentional community based on his experiences, learning, and views. Beilhart led the group for nine years before he died of appendicitis and peritonitis in 1908. Beilhart's commune survived for another 22 years {{making it one of the}} longest surviving communes in America.|$|E
5|$|Between 1956 and 1964 Manning's {{main project}} was The Balkan Trilogy, a {{sequence}} of three novels based on her experiences during the Second World War; as usual she was supported and encouraged by Reggie. The books describe the marriage of Harriet and Guy Pringle as they live <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> Romania and Greece, ending with their escape to Alexandria in 1941 {{just ahead of the}} Germans. Guy, a man at once admirable and unsatisfactory, and Harriet, a woman alternately proud and impatient, move from early passion to acceptance of difference. Manning described the books as long chapters of an autobiography, and early versions were written in the first person. There was significant fictionalisation, however. While Manning had been 31 and Reggie 25 at the outset of war, Manning's alter ego Harriet Pringle was a mere 21, and her husband a year older. Manning was a writer by profession, while her creation was not.|$|E
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1936, the {{management}} of the New York Philharmonic was confronted with a problem. Toscanini had left in search of higher fees with the NBC Symphony Orchestra. Wilhelm Furtwängler had accepted the orchestra's invitation to fill the post, but he was politically unacceptable to a section of the Philharmonic's audience because he continued to live <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> Germany under the Nazi government. Following a campaign of protest in New York he felt unable to take up the appointment. For want of any available conductor of comparable fame {{the management of the}} orchestra invited five guest conductors to divide the season among them. Barbirolli was allotted the first ten weeks of the season, comprising 26 concerts. He was followed by the composer-conductors Igor Stravinsky, Georges Enescu and Carlos Chávez, each conducting for two weeks, and finally by Artur Rodziński of the Cleveland Orchestra, for eight weeks.|$|E

5|$|Creators {{and writers}} David Crane and Marta Kauffman were {{known in the}} {{television}} industry for writing the cable television series Dream On. A second series by the duo, Family Album, had premiered on CBS in the Fall 1993 season but was cancelled after airing six episodes. In November 1993, they began developing three new television pilots from their offices at Warner Bros. Television that could premiere in the Fall 1994 season. As Dream On had won them clout in Hollywood, they aimed to pitch one of their ideas to NBC; Insomnia Cafe, about six friends who live <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> New York City, was pitched as a seven-page treatment to the network in December 1993.|$|E
5|$|Expanding {{access to}} parks was {{a feature of}} many {{initiatives}} Jewell undertook as Secretary. A 2014 Secretarial Order set benchmarks to increase youth involvement, seeking to create opportunities {{for young people to}} play, learn, serve, <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> national parks. Jewell led the kickoff of the Every Kid Every Park program by leading fourth graders on a hike through Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area. The Every Kid initiative made every fourth grade student, and their families, eligible for a free one-year pass to every national park. Jewell also backed a 2016 initiative to expedite permitting for youth organizations to explore public wild lands on overnight or multi-day trips, particularly in less popular parks.|$|E
5|$|Glenn {{remained}} {{an officer in}} the Marine Corps after his selection, but was assigned to the NASA Space Task Group at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. The task force moved to Houston, Texas, in 1962, and became part of the NASA Manned Spacecraft Center. A portion of the astronauts' training was in space science, but it had a practical aspect, which included scuba diving <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> simulators. Astronauts secured an additional role in the spaceflight program: to provide pilot input in design. The astronauts divided the various tasks between them. Glenn's specialisation was cockpit layout design and control functioning for the Mercury and early Apollo programs. He pressed the other astronauts to set a moral example, living up to the squeaky-clean image of them that had been portrayed by Life magazine, a position that was not popular with the other astronauts.|$|E
