Participants were one hundred and seven children {{with a mean age}} of 11. 1 ± 0. 9 years. Three experiments were carried out using a complex anticipatory timing task manipulating the following components in the varied practice: visual stimulus speed (experiment 1); sequential response pattern (experiment 2); and visual stimulus speed plus sequential response pattern (experiment 3). In all experiments the design involved three amounts (18, 36, and 63 trials), and two schedules (random and blocked) of varied practice. The experiments also involved two learning phases: stabilization and adaptation. The dependent variables were the <b>absolute,</b> <b>variable,</b> and constant errors related to the task goal, and the relative timing of the sequential response. Results showed that all groups worsened the performances in the adaptation phase, and no difference was observed between them. Altogether, the results of the three experiments allow the conclusion that the amounts of trials manipulated in the random and blocked practices did not promote the diversification of the skill since no adaptation was observed. </p...|$|E
40|$|Study Design. A {{cross-sectional}} study between subgroups of nonspecific chronic {{low back pain}} (NSCLBP) and asymptomatic controls. Objective. To investigate NSCLBP subgroup differences in spinal position sense and trunk muscle activity when repositioning thoracic and lumbar spine into neutral (midrange) spinal position during sitting and standing. Summary of Background Data. Patients with NSCLBP report aggravation of symptoms during sitting and standing. Impaired motor control in NSCLBP, associated with sitting and standing postures nearer the end range of spinal motion, may be a contributing factor. Rehabilitation improving neutral (midrange) spinal position control is advocated. Postural and motor control alterations vary in different NSCLBP subgroups, potentially requiring specific postural interventions. There is limited evidence on whether subgroup differences exist when performing neutral spine position tasks. Methods. Ninety patients with NSCLBP and 35 asymptomatic controls were recruited. Two blinded practitioners classified NSCLBP into subgroups of active extension pattern and flexion pattern. Participants were assisted into neutral spine position and asked to reproduce this position 4 times. <b>Absolute,</b> <b>variable,</b> and constant errors were calculated. Three-dimensional thoracic and lumbar kinematics quantified the repositioning accuracy and surface electromyography assessed back and abdominal muscles activity bilaterally. Results. Irrespective of subclassification, patients with NSCLBP produced significantly greater error magnitude and variability than the asymptomatic controls, but subgroup differences were detected in the error direction. Subgroup differences in the trunk muscle activity were not consistently identified. Although both subgroups produced significantly higher abdominal activity, subclassification revealed difference in superficial multifidus activity during standing, with flexion pattern producing significantly greater activity than the asymptomatic controls. Conclusion. Subgroups of NSCLBP had similar neutral spinal position deficits regarding error magnitude and variability, but subclassification revealed clear subgroup differences {{in the direction of}} the deficit. The trunk muscle activation was shown to be largely nondiscriminatory between subgroups, with the exception of superficial lumbar multifidus...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} coincidence anticipation timing (CAT) performance at slow and fast stimulus speeds before, during, and after an acute bout of walking in adults aged 60 – 76 years. Results {{from a series}} of repeated measures ANOVAs indicated significant rest versus exercise × stimulus speed × time interactions for <b>absolute</b> and <b>variable</b> errors (both P= 0. 0001) whereby <b>absolute</b> and <b>variable</b> error scores, when stimulus speed was slow, improved as the duration of exercise increased. When stimulus speed was fast there were significantly greater <b>absolute</b> and <b>variable</b> errors at 18 minutes of the walking bout. There was also greater error at 18 minutes during walking compared to rest. These results suggest that, in a task involving walking and CAT, stimulus speeds plays an important role; specifically walking (exercise) enhances CAT performance at slow stimulus speeds but reduces CAT performance at fast stimulus speeds. The implications are that in everyday situations, where events require dual-task responses to be made at different speeds, for example, walking on the pavement whilst avoiding a crowd, compared to crossing a busy road, an understanding of how different stimulus speeds influence dual-task performance is extremely important, particularly in the older adult population...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, a {{surrogate}} model is aimed to be constructed for the separation-refrigeration (S-R) {{section in the}} ammonia plant. First, the variables defining the process are classified by input variables and output variables. Then the variables are reduced {{as many as possible}} using the dependency relationships. After the input and output variables are determined by variable identification, adaptive sampling is implemented to sample the input variables to obtain the input sample space with minimized number of sample points. The resultant input sample data is imported to HYSYS to obtain the corresponding output sample data. However, the HYSYS model was not able to calculate the corresponding output samples due to convergence issues. In order to address this issue, we divided the separation-refrigeration section furthermore into the HEx part, the separator part and the refrigeration section. Then we use the same approach to construct {{a surrogate}} model for the HEx part. We used two different variable identifications to define the output variables, of which one used the <b>absolute</b> output <b>variables</b> and the other one used variables differences. Sample spaces of both cases are obtained and surrogate models are generated using artificial neural network based on the sample spaces. The resultant surrogate models are validated by comparing their output predictions with the HYSYS' output results and the relative deviations are calculated. It can be concluded that the surrogate models can be efficiently constructed based on the approach used in this thesis. Using the adaptive sampling, the number of sample points required to generate surrogate models can be successfully minimized, which saved computational expense of model construction effectively. In the approach of surrogate model construction, the variable identification is extremely crucial. It can affect both the computational expense of surrogate model generation and the accuracy of resultant surrogate models. Generally, the variable differences can save the computational expense but results in less accurate surrogate models than <b>absolute</b> <b>variables.</b> The approach used in this thesis can also be implemented to construct the surrogate models for other simulators...|$|R

40|$|Language and {{innovation}} are inseparable. Language conveys ideas which are essential in corporate innovation; innovation would be nearly impossible {{if we did}} not have language. Language establishes the most immediate connections with our conceptualisation of the outside world, and it provides the building blocks for communication. The structure of language itself reflects its functional and communicative use. Communication takes place when there is a real information exchange process. Every linguistic choice is necessarily meaningful, and <b>absolute</b> <b>variables</b> involve the parallel construction of form and meaning. From this perspective, language is not only structure, but a dynamic knowledge construction process as well. Knowledge transfer {{and innovation}} transfer are ubiquitous processes: knowledge extraction requires heterogeneous tasks related to the acquisition, from unstructured textual data in digital format, of structured and classified information relating to research topics. In the full version of this approach, emphasis will be laid on the mechanisms underlying language processing and communicative interaction, outlining knowledge retention and retrieval processes. The spread of Internet has enabled development of better bibliographic scientific databases with significantly improved capacity for storage and retrieval. In recent years, web searching has become the default mode of highly innovative information retrieval, though the main sources of digital information are unstructured or semi-structured documents. Information relating to developments in scientific research is collected in the form of abstracts or full publications, in large and growing bibliographic repositories. Considering the web as a corpus makes it possible to investigate how words are used to describe innovation, and how innovation topics can influence word usage and collocational behaviour. Investigation of corpora is concerned with the description of use and structure of language, by inquiring linguistic phenomena such as, co-occurence distributions, collocational variability, derivational productivity, neologism coinage. This will bring into focus the dynamic interplay between lexical creativity and innovative pragmatic contexts, thus blurring the traditional dichotomy between knowledge of language and its use. In particular, the work will focus on how words and language structures become vehicle for knowledge generation and innovation transfer, and how research data, research results and widely-distributed dissemination papers can support and enhance future research...|$|R

A {{new type of}} double-penalized least squares is formulated, using the smoothing spline to estimate the nonparametric part and applying a shrinkage penalty on parametric components to achieve model parsimony. Theoretically we show that, with proper choices of the smoothing and regularization parameters, the proposed pro-cedure can be as efficient as the oracle estimator (Fan and Li, 2001). We also study the asymptotic properties of the estimator {{when the number of}} parametric effects diverges with the sample size. Frequentist and Bayesian estimates of the covariance and confi-dence intervals are derived for the estimators. One great advantage of this procedure is its linear mixed model (LMM) representation, which greatly facilitates its implementa-tion by using standard statistical software. Furthermore, the LMM framework enables one to treat the smoothing parameter as a variance component and hence conveniently estimate it together with other regression coefficients. Extensive numerical studies are conducted to demonstrate the effective performance of the proposed procedure.
