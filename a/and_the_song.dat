5|$|Military clashes {{continued}} in Huainan and Sichuan, but Jin incursions after Caishi had no intent {{of reaching the}} Yangtze. The Jin had discovered that southern China's many lakes and rivers impeded their cavalry. They signed a peace treaty with the Song in 1165, ending hostilities. The Huai River border remained the same <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Song</b> continued to pay annual indemnities to the Jin, but the Song no longer recognized their state as a Jin vassal.|$|E

5|$|On October 11, 1142, {{after about}} a year of negotiations, the Treaty of Shaoxing was ratified, ending the {{conflict}} between the Jin <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Song.</b> By the terms of the treaty, the Huai River, north of the Yangtze, was designated as the boundary between the two empires. The Song agreed to pay a yearly tribute of 250,000 taels of silver and 250,000 packs of silk to the Jin.|$|E
5|$|Promotional {{recordings}} of the song were released in the United States and Mexico, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>song</b> appeared on two record charts shortly after its release in 1993.

5|$|The Jin–Song Wars were {{a series}} of armed {{conflicts}} conducted by the Jurchen Jin dynasty <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Song</b> dynasty in the 12th and 13th centuries. The Jurchens were a Tungusic–speaking tribal confederation native to Manchuria. They overthrew the Khitan Liao dynasty in 1122 and declared {{the establishment of a}} new dynasty, the Jin. Diplomatic relations between the Jin and Song deteriorated, and the Jurchens first declared war on the Song dynasty in November 1125.|$|E

5|$|The quick {{collapse}} of the Liao led to more negotiations between the Song and the Jin. Jurchen military success and their effective control over the Sixteen Prefectures gave them more leverage. Aguda grew increasingly frustrated as he realized that despite their military failures the Song still intended to seize most of the prefectures. In the spring of 1123 the two sides finally set {{the terms of the}} first Song–Jin treaty. Only seven prefectures (including Yanjing) would be returned to the Song, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Song</b> would pay an annual indemnity of 300,000 packs of silk and 200,000 taels of silver to the Jin, as well as a one-time payment of one million strings of copper coins to compensate the Jurchens for the tax revenue they would have earned had they not returned the prefectures.

5|$|Birds of the {{nominate}} subspecies {{were introduced}} to New Zealand and Australia by acclimatisation societies between 1860 and 1880, apparently for purely sentimental reasons. In New Zealand, where it was introduced on both the main islands, the song thrush quickly established itself and spread to surrounding islands such as the Kermadecs, Chatham and Auckland Islands. Although it is common and widespread in New Zealand, in Australia only a small population survives around Melbourne. In New Zealand, {{there appears to be}} a limited detrimental effect on some invertebrates due to predation by introduced bird species, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>song</b> thrush also damages commercial fruit crops in that country. As an introduced species it has no legal protection in New Zealand, and can be killed at any time.|$|E
5|$|Both {{males and}} females utilize calls in alarm situations, {{especially}} in territorial disputes and encounters with predators. Males alone produce the cheer call, which can sound indistinct. In southern regions of their range, the sound males use in alarm disputes is a ringing pink or p'dink sound. Females {{are the only ones}} that can perform the paired dit-dit or chatter sounds. The former can be used in territorial disputes with predators, and with at least northern populations the songs are used in alternation with the males cheer chant. The chatter is used exclusively with territorial encounters with male song, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>song</b> can either follow or overlap her mate's song.|$|E

5|$|Britten's {{other works}} range from orchestral to choral, solo vocal, chamber and {{instrumental}} {{as well as}} film music.

He often composed with particular performers in mind. His most frequent and important muse was his personal and professional partner, the tenor Peter Pears; others included Kathleen Ferrier, Jennifer Vyvyan, Janet Baker, Dennis Brain, Julian Bream, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Mstislav Rostropovich. Britten was a celebrated pianist and conductor, performing many of his own works in concert and on record. He also performed and recorded works by others, such as Bach's Brandenburg concertos, Mozart symphonies, and song cycles by Schubert and Schumann.|$|E
5|$|By 1127, Jin had conquered most of {{northern}} China and besieged the Song capital of Kaifeng twice. In the second siege of Kaifeng, Emperor Qinzong of the Song was captured. The Jurchens took him <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Song</b> royal family to Manchuria as hostages. Members of the Song court who had evaded capture fled south, where they established a temporary capital, {{first in the}} Song southern capital (modern Shangqiu), and then in Hangzhou in 1129. The move of the Song capital south to Hangzhou signals {{the transition from the}} Northern Song era to the Southern Song. Qinzong's younger brother, Prince Zhao Gou, was enthroned as Qinzong's successor in the southern capital in 1127; he is known posthumously as Emperor Gaozong. The Jurchen general Wuzhu crossed the Yangtze River in 1130 and tried to capture Gaozong, but the Emperor escaped. Wuzhu retreated north across the Yangtze, where he fought off a stronger Song fleet commanded by Han Shizhong.|$|E

An underwater scene with mermaids and fish follows, then a parade of all the girl's toys around her room. As the song wraps, the fairy taps on the girl and causes her to yawn. She falls asleep again and her toys go back to being as they were. The violins and the instruments gradually fade inside the radio <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>song</b> ends.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the death}} of Gaozong and the {{emergence}} of the Mongols, the Song dynasty formed a military alliance with the Mongols in the hope of finally defeating the Jin dynasty. Several tens of thousands of carts full of grain were sent to the Mongol army during the siege. Following the destruction of the Jurchens in 1234, the Southern Song generals broke the alliance, proceeding to recapture the three historical capitals of Kaifeng, Luoyang and Chang'an. However, the cities, ravaged by years of warfare, lacked economic capacity and yielded little defensibility. This breaking of alliance meant open warfare between the Mongols <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Song</b> Chinese. Ögodei Khan's forces conquered fifty-four out of Sichuan's fifty-eight total districts by 1236, while ordering the slaughter of over a million people that inhabited the city of Chengdu, which was taken by the Mongols with ease.|$|E
5|$|For a {{brief period}} in 1848, Smetana was a revolutionary. In the climate of {{political}} change and upheaval that swept through Europe in that year, a pro-democracy movement in Prague led by Smetana's old friend Karel Havlíček was urging an end to Habsburg absolutist rule and for more political autonomy. A Citizens' Army ("Svornost") was formed to defend the city against possible attack. Smetana wrote a series of patriotic works, including two marches dedicated respectively to the Czech National Guard and the Students' Legion of the University of Prague, <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Song</b> of Freedom to words by Ján Kollár. In June 1848, as the Habsburg armies moved to suppress rebellious tendencies, Prague came under attack from the Austrian forces led by the Prince of Windisch-Grätz. As a member of Svornost, Smetana helped to man the barricades on the Charles Bridge. The nascent uprising was quickly crushed, but Smetana avoided the imprisonment or exile received by leaders such as Havlíček. During his brief spell with Svornost, he met the writer and leading radical, Karel Sabina, who would later provide libretti for Smetana's first two operas.|$|E
