Lights <b>and</b> <b>Sounds</b> is Yellowcard's first concept album, which was inspired to reflect what the band was feeling {{at the time of}} production and how they have matured in the process. Lights <b>and</b> <b>Sounds</b> also departs from the sounds on Yellowcard's previous album, Ocean Avenue (2003), which broke away from its pop punk sound to a more alternative rock album.|$|E

50|$|Plays were {{performed}} in medieval {{times in a}} form of theatre called Commedia dell'arte, which used music <b>and</b> <b>sound</b> effects to enhance performances. The use of music <b>and</b> <b>sound</b> in the Elizabethan Theatre followed, in which music <b>and</b> <b>sound</b> effects were produced off stage using devices such as bells, whistles, and horns. Cues would be written in the script for music <b>and</b> <b>sound</b> effects to be played at the appropriate time.|$|R
40|$|About the Book: Music, <b>Sound</b> <b>and</b> Space is {{the first}} {{collection}} to integrate research from musicology <b>and</b> <b>sound</b> studies on music <b>and</b> <b>sound</b> as they mediate everyday life. Music <b>and</b> <b>sound</b> exert an inescapable influence on the contemporary world, from the ubiquity of MP 3 players to the controversial use of sound {{as an instrument of}} torture. In this book, leading scholars explore the spatialisation of music <b>and</b> <b>sound,</b> their capacity to engender modes of publicness and privacy, their constitution of subjectivity, and the politics of <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> space. Chapters discuss music <b>and</b> <b>sound</b> in relation to distinctive genres, technologies <b>and</b> settings, including <b>sound</b> installation art, popular music recordings, offices and hospitals, and music therapy. With international examples, from the Islamic soundscape of the Kenyan coast, to religious music in Europe, to First Nation musical sociability in Canada, this book offers a new global perspective on how music <b>and</b> <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> their spatialising capacities transform the nature of public and private experience...|$|R
5|$|The Nord Stage 2 {{also has}} the ability to play samples, {{allowing}} it to reproduce the functionality of a Mellotron or Chamberlin. Individual samples can be downloaded from Clavia's website, and a community has developed that provides new instruments <b>and</b> <b>sounds.</b>|$|E

5|$|The game {{features}} officially licensed {{cars from}} international manufacturers. Several modes of playing are present, including a training mode and a two-player mode. The game's music, primarily composed by Shinji Hosoe, was published as a soundtrack in Japan.

5|$|Ethnic Cleansing was {{developed}} {{by members of the}} National Alliance, an American white supremacist organization, and published by Resistance Records, its subsidiary record label that specializes in white power music. It {{was developed}} for Microsoft Windows personal computers using Eclipse Entertainment's open-source game engine Genesis3D along with the Reality Factory development kit. The source code was not substantially changed from the original. Instead, the developers simply plugged in images <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> that they had created in freely available editing programs.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the video arcade games, Sega Enterprises, Inc. (USA) created a Crazy Taxi themed redemption game which was released in 2003. The player had to roll their coin or token down the sloped playing surface past a moving taxi model {{in the center of}} the playing field in order to hit one of eight targets (representing passengers) at the far end. Passengers were worth different points, from which the operator would then set the number of tickets to be won. The game incorporated music <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> from the video games.|$|E

5|$|Radical Dreamers {{features}} minimal {{graphics and}} animation; most areas are rendered with dim, static backgrounds. The game also uses atmospheric music <b>and</b> <b>sounds.</b> Like other Chrono games, Radical Dreamers contains {{a variant of}} New Game + mode. Only one scenario {{is available on the}} first play-through; after finishing it and obtaining one of three possible endings, players can explore six others. These later stories often feature comical situations or allusions to Chrono Trigger.|$|E
5|$|Telecommunication is the {{transmission}} of signs, signals, messages, words, writings, images <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> or information of any nature by wire, radio, optical or other electromagnetic systems. Telecommunication occurs when the exchange of information between communication participants includes the use of technology. It is transmitted either electrically over physical media, such as cables, or via electromagnetic radiation. Such transmission paths are often divided into communication channels which afford the advantages of multiplexing. Since the Latin term communicatio is considered the social process of information exchange, the term, telecommunications, is often used in its plural form because it involves many different technologies.|$|E
5|$|The band {{rented a}} house, {{and hoped that}} living communally would foster good {{relations}} and a happier recording environment. According to Corgan, Iha refused {{to live in the}} house and rarely visited. The recording sessions continued to be slow-moving and heavily technical. In the absence of a drummer, the band used a drum machine as it had in its earliest incarnation. The band also enlisted Joey Waronker, of Beck's band, and Matt Cameron, of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, for a few songs each. Bon Harris of Nitzer Ebb contributed electronic sequencing <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> to eight album tracks, with the band giving him mostly free rein.|$|E

5|$|The poem {{has three}} eleven-line stanzas which {{describe}} a progression through the season, {{from the late}} maturation of the crops to the harvest and to {{the last days of}} autumn when winter is nearing. The imagery is richly achieved through the personification of Autumn, and the description of its bounty, its sights <b>and</b> <b>sounds.</b> It has parallels in the work of English landscape artists, with Keats himself describing the fields of stubble that he saw on his walk as being like that in a painting.|$|E
5|$|The {{reformed}} band {{worked at}} a prolific pace, rehearsing, and touring France before recording three new albums in just 12 months, beginning with Godbluff (October 1975). Unlike the earlier work with John Anthony at Trident, the sessions were produced by the band themselves, and both the Melody Maker <b>and</b> <b>Sounds</b> thought they were a tighter and more cohesive unit than previously. The album in particular saw Hammill making significant use of the Hohner clavinet keyboard. Still Life followed on 15 April 1976. Banton considers this album one of his favourites by the group.|$|E
5|$|The team {{tried to}} capture {{the feel of the}} {{original}} game with updated graphics <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> in the demo. It was to feature ten short interactive scenes from Chrono Trigger. Despite receiving requests from fans, the development team did not intend to create a complete remake of the original game since they would not have the necessary resources, and because they thought the result would not have been on par with Square Enix-developed titles. The story of the game was altered slightly to allow for the ten scenes to better flow from one to the other.|$|E
