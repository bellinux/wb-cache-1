25|$|The {{next morning}} during roll call, Miklós finds Saul {{and tells him}} that he needs a {{replacement}} body, {{similar to the one}} Saul has taken. The prisoners are then summoned into the crematorium to get back to work, where they discover that Biedermann and his unit have been gassed by the SS. Abraham starts a riot with the other prisoners and they attack the SS guards, starting the rebellion. After managing to escape from the crematorium, Saul retrieves the boy's body and escapes to the woods with Braun and few other prisoners. When they reach a river, Saul finds a chance to bury the body, only to discover that Braun is a fraud when he can't recite the Kaddish. When he hears the guards approaching, Saul tries to carry the body across the river. Unable to manage the current with the added weight, he loses his grasp on the sack and is pulled out of the river by Rabbi Frankel as the body floats away. When the prisoners arrive at a shed in the forest, they start to discuss a plan to join the Polish resistance. Saul notices a young peasant boy peeking into the shed and smiles at him, the only time he is shown with <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b> <b>As</b> the boy runs away, guards run past {{in the direction of the}} shed. Gunfire echoes as the camera follows the boy into the woods.|$|E

500|$|Hunt's songwriting on {{the album}} is {{characterized}} by resolute lyrics, multi-layered storylines, social commentary, a droll perspective, poetic subtlety, thematic subtext, and whimsy. Songs {{on the album}} are unified by a theme of tension and dissonance in modern life. The songs explore topics and issues in contemporary society and culture, including gentrification, identity politics, and mass consumption, accompanied {{by a sense of}} hope in Hunt's lyrics. Hunt explains the album to have a [...] "loose concept", with songs unified by subject matter concerning [...] "unspoken issues around society", and says of his lyrical sentiments on the album, [...] "It fits my personality that no matter what's going on I'm going to answer it honestly with a wink and <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b> <b>As</b> cliché as it might be, I feel like every situation needs a laugh." [...] L. Michael Gipson of Creative Loafing notes David Bowie and Lenny Kravitz as references points for Hunt's songwriting, and writes that What Were You Hoping For? explores [...] "both sides of the political aisles" [...] with metaphorical songs such as [...] "North Hollywood", [...] "Designer Jeans", and the title track, as well as themes concerning an intimate relationship with the songs [...] "Moving Targets", [...] "Falls (Violet)", and [...] "Cross Dresser".|$|E
