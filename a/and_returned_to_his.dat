In Armenia, he struggled to contain the rising power of the Christian princes, but after failing to suppress the revolt {{of one of his}} own subordinates, he abandoned the country <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> native Jazira.

5|$|On May 1, 1899, Captain Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich assumed {{command of}} Rostislav, {{becoming}} the first Romanov since Peter I to command a combat ship. Another Romanov, Grand Duke Kirill, spent a few uneventful months on board Rostislav in 1900. Alexander's guests, parties and diplomatic visits to Istanbul regularly interfered with the crew's duties, but he personally managed the repairs and alterations of the ship's equipment. Shipyards and contractors treated Rostislav as a priority customer. Alexander, based on his experience with Sissoi Veliky, persuaded the NTC to reinforce Rostislavs rudder frame and supervised installation of a backup control post deep under the conning tower. In 1903 Alexander was promoted to rear admiral <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> ship as a squadron commander. Rostislav served as the junior flagship of the Black Sea Fleet until September 1912.|$|E
