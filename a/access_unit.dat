40|$|In {{the current}} ATM LAN Emulation (LANE) {{standard}} {{the issues of}} flow control and bandwidth allocation in the <b>Access</b> <b>Units</b> have not been adequately addressed. This paper investigates ways to enhance the functionality of typical legacy LAN-ATM <b>Access</b> <b>Units</b> (AUs) {{with the addition of}} low-level flow control mechanisms. The scheme proposed is based on the Available Bit Rate (ABR) control mechanism currently standardized for ATM. Backpressure flow control is not terminated in the AU but is further extended to reach the non-ATM legacy LAN stations. This is achieved by using a subset of the Logical Link Control (LLC) protocol functionality executed between the AU and the legacy LAN stations. Apart from the QoS guarantees, the proposed method is transparent to the upper transport layer protocols and as such it does not require fundamental modifications to existing AUs and LAN stations...|$|R

5000|$|A coded video {{sequence}} {{consists of a}} series of access units that are sequential in the NAL unit stream and use only one sequence parameter set. Each coded {{video sequence}} can be decoded independently of any other coded video sequence, given the necessary parameter set information, which may be conveyed [...] "in-band" [...] or [...] "out-of-band". At the beginning of a coded video sequence is an instantaneous decoding refresh (IDR) <b>access</b> <b>unit.</b> An IDR <b>access</b> <b>unit</b> contains an intra picture which is a coded picture that can be decoded without decoding any previous pictures in the NAL unit stream, and the presence of an IDR <b>access</b> <b>unit</b> indicates that no subsequent picture in the stream will require reference to pictures prior to the intra picture it contains in order to be decoded.A NAL unit stream may contain one or more coded video sequence.|$|E
5000|$|A set of NAL {{units in}} a {{specified}} form {{is referred to}} as an <b>access</b> <b>unit.</b> The decoding of each <b>access</b> <b>unit</b> results in one decoded picture.Each <b>access</b> <b>unit</b> contains a set of VCL NAL units that together compose a primary coded picture. It may also be prefixed with an <b>access</b> <b>unit</b> delimiter to aid in locating the start of the <b>access</b> <b>unit.</b> Some supplemental enhancement information containing data such as picture timing information may also precede the primary coded picture.The primary coded picture consists of a set of VCL NAL units consisting of slices or [...] slice data partitions that represent the samples of the video picture.Following the primary coded picture may be some additional VCL NAL units that contain redundant representations of areas of the same video picture. These are referred to as redundant coded pictures, and are available for use by a decoder in recovering from loss or corruption of the data in the primary coded pictures. Decoders are not required to decode redundant coded pictures if they are present.Finally, if the coded picture is the last picture of a coded video sequence (a sequence of pictures that is independently decodable and uses only one sequence parameter set), an end of sequence NAL unit may be present to indicate the end of the sequence; and if the coded picture is the last coded picture in the entire NAL unit stream, an end of stream NAL unit may be present to indicate that the stream is ending.|$|E

50|$|Later IBM {{would release}} Controlled <b>Access</b> <b>Units</b> that could support {{multiple}} MAU modules {{known as a}} Lobe Attachment Module. The CAUs supported features such as Dual-Ring Redundancy for alternate routing {{in the event of}} a dead port, modular concentration with LAMs, and multiple interfaces like most later MAUs. This offered a more reliable setup and remote management than with an unmanaged MAU hub.|$|R
50|$|MUSICAM {{was one of}} the few codecs able {{to achieve}} high audio quality at bit rates in the range of 64 to 192 kbit/s per {{monophonic}} channel.

50|$|The first method {{increases}} latency, but allows performing decoding and de-blocking in parallel. However, {{managing a}} large number of pointers (in the worst case, one pointer for each MB) and increasing the intelligence of the DRAM <b>access</b> <b>unit</b> increase the decoder complexity.|$|E

50|$|The full {{degree of}} {{customization}} {{of the video}} content to fit the needs of each particular application is {{outside the scope of}} the video coding standardization effort, but the design of the NAL anticipates a variety of such mappings.

5000|$|Token Ring network {{interface}} cards contain {{all of the}} intelligence required for speed autodetection, routing and can drive themselves on many Multistation <b>Access</b> <b>Units</b> (MAUs) that operate without power (most MAUs operate in this fashion, only requiring a power supply for LEDs).

50|$|ISO 11898-2:2003 {{specifies}} {{the high-speed}} (transmission rates {{of up to}} 1 Mbit/s) medium <b>access</b> <b>unit</b> (MAU), and some medium dependent interface (MDI) features (according to ISO 8802-3), which comprise the physical layer of the controller area network. ISO 11898-2 uses a two-wire balanced signalling scheme. It is the most used physical layer in car powertrain applications and industrial control networks.|$|E
50|$|ISO 11898-5:2007 {{specifies}} the CAN {{physical layer}} for transmission rates up to 1 Mbit/s for use within road vehicles. It describes the medium <b>access</b> <b>unit</b> functions {{as well as}} some medium dependent interface features according to ISO 8802-2. This represents an extension of ISO 11898-2, dealing with new functionality for systems requiring low-power consumption features while there is no active bus communication.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a consumption model {{that takes into}} account the valuation and demand uncertainties that consumers face while using access services. Typical examples of such services include telecommunication services, extended warranties for consumer electronics, and club memberships. We demonstrate that consumption is affected by contract structure (pay-peruse vs. three part tariffs) even if the optimal consumption plans are identical. We find that a majority of individuals correctly use a threshold policy that is similar to a nearly optimal heuristic, however they use the free units too quickly leading to overconsumption and lost surplus. These errors are partially driven by mistaken beliefs about the value distribution. We also measure subjects' willingness to pay for a contract with free <b>access</b> <b>units,</b> and we find that nearly half of subjects are willing to pay at least the full per-unit price, with a substantial fraction willing to overpay. The optimal firm strategy is therefore to offer a contract that presells <b>access</b> <b>units</b> at a very small discount; this strategy increases revenue by 8 - 15 % compared to only offering a pay-per-use contract...|$|R
