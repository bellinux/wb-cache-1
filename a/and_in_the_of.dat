"Here lies buried George Beeston, knight, a {{promoter}} of valour and truth; having {{been brought up}} from his youth in the arts of war he was chosen one of his company of pensioners by the invincible King Henry the Eighth, when he besieged Boulogne he merited [...] under Edward the Sixth {{in the battle against}} the Scots at Musselburgh [...] Afterwards under the same King, under Mary, and under Elizabeth, in the naval engagements as captain or vice-captain of the fleet, by whom, after that most mighty Spanish fleet of 1588, had been vanquished, he was honoured with the order of knighthood; and now, his years pressing heavily on him, when he had admirably approved his integrity to princes, and his bravery to his adversaries, acceptable to God, and dear to good men, and long expecting Christ, in the year 1601 <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ... <b>of</b> his age, he fell asleep in Him, so that he may rise again in Him with joy. And together with him rests a most beloved wife, Alice, daughter of [...] Davenport of Henbury, esquire, a matron most holy, chaste, and liberal to the poor, who, when she had lived in matrimony 66 years, and had borne to her husband three sons, John, Hugh, and Hugh, and as many daughters, Ann, Jane, and Dorothy, passed into the heavenly country in the year 1591 and in the [...] year of her age, with Christ for ever to live. The dutifulness of their son Hugh Beeston, esquire, the younger, Receiver General of all the revenues of the Crown {{as well as in the}} county palatine of Chester as in the counties of North Wales, set up this monument to parents most excellent and beloved." ...|$|E
40|$|Building {{facilities}} have become important infrastructures for modern productive plants dedicated to services. In this context, the control systems of intelligent buildings have evolved while their reliability has evidently improved. However, {{the occurrence of}} faults is inevitable in systems conceived, constructed and operated by humans. Thus, a practical alternative approach {{is found to be}} very useful to reduce the consequences of faults. Yet, only few publications address intelligent building modeling processes that take into consideration the occurrence of faults and how to manage their consequences. In the light of the foregoing, a procedure is proposed for the modeling of intelligent building control systems, considersing their functional specifications in normal operation <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>of</b> the event of faults. The proposed procedure adopts the concepts of discrete event systems and holons, and explores Petri nets and their extensions so as to represent the structure and operation of control systems for intelligent buildings under normal and abnormal situations.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to examine possible aluminum (Al) accumulation in the brain of rats and to investigate whether subchronic exposure to the metal leads to behavioral and neurophysiological changes in both treated and control groups. Each of the groups consisted of 10 animals. Aluminum chloride (AlCl 3) at a low (50 mg/kg/d) or high (200 mg/kg/d) dose was applied to male Wistar rats by gavage for 8 wk. Al-free water by gavage {{was given to the}} control group throughout the experiment. Behavioral effects were evaluated by open-field (OF) motor activity and by acoustic startle response (ASR). Electrophysiological examination was done by recording spontaneous activity and sensory-evoked potentials from the visual, somatosensory, as well as auditory cortex. The Al content of each whole brain was determined by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Subchronic Al exposure slightly caused some changes in the evoked potentials and electrocorticograms <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>OF</b> and ASR performance, but these results were not statistically significant. The brain Al levels of the control and the low and high dose of Al-exposed groups were measured as 0. 717 +- 0. 208 μg/g (wet weight), 0. 963 +- 0. 491 μg/g (wet weight) and 1. 816 +- 1. 157 μg/g (wet weight), respectively...|$|E

40|$|Summary Kirsten Schwepke Normal Kirsten Schwepke 2 2002 - 05 - 12 T 14 : 21 : 00 Z 2002 - 05 - 12 T 14 : 21 : 00 Z 2 396 2261 18 4 2776 9. 3821 21 Summary   Subject of {{the present}} in vitro study was to {{investigate}} bonding strength between the all-ceramic coping materials Zirconia-TZP and In-Ceram Zirconia in combination with suitable coverings. Specific attention was paid to the artificial ageing caused by frequent changes of temperature.   This investigation also examined whether improvement of bond-strength can be achieved by using the surface condition technology of silicon ion implantation as proposed by WEHNERT for titanium-porcelain veneering in 1996. Silicon ion implantation is supposed to reduce potential loss of bond-strength, caused by artificial ageing after the thermocycling process.   Furthermore, subject of this study was the consideration, if the common annealing of the implantation damage of the solid structure (temperature treatment), in semiconductor fabrication usually used after ion beam process, has a positive influence on the increasing bond strength in addition to the ion implantation.     Zirconia-TZP specimens which had been fabricated by CAD/CAM milling were veneered using two different dental porcelains (VITA VERBLENDKERAMK D and VITA TITANKERAMIK). The surface of the specimen was conditioned beforehand by implanting silicon ions. For reason of comparison unconditioned samples had been used. Samples of In-Ceram Zirconia were prepared in the same manner by the copy-milled-procedure, but veneered by VITADUR a instead of VERBLENDKERAMIK D.   The shear bonding strength was tested by using the SCHMITZ-SCHULMEYER method, after 24 hours of dry storage conditions, respectively after 20 000 terms of thermocycling.   Finally the morphology and the chemical composition of the interface of the advanced ceramic and the veneering porcelain were examined in a Scanning Electron Microscope and Energy Dispersion Analyser.   The present study shows that both temperature changes and wetting influences have had an effect on the different ceramics.   Corresponding to the intention of this study and resembling to the examination of WEHNERT´s titanium-porcelain-veneering-bonding, the success can be found in avoiding of bonding strength losses of VERBLENDKERAMIK D on ZrO 2 -TZP <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>of</b> combination of In-Ceram Zirconia / Vitadur a with surface modified treatment of silicon ion implantation after thermocycling.   The temper procedure with the used parameters demonstrated no further advantage referring to bonding strength.     The results of SEM and EDAX- Analyses leaves questions concerning the structure of adhesion boundary, which could be answered by more specific and analytic methods.   Long-term in-vivo studies could help even more detailed to understand the behaviour properties of different ceramics and their combinations in the oral cavity. </div...|$|E
