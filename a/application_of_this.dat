5|$|A major {{technological}} <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{information is}} metabolic engineering. Here, organisms such as yeast, plants or bacteria are genetically modified {{to make them}} more useful in biotechnology and aid the production of drugs such as antibiotics or industrial chemicals such as 1,3-propanediol and shikimic acid. These genetic modifications usually aim {{to reduce the amount of}} energy used to produce the product, increase yields and reduce the production of wastes.|$|E
5|$|One <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{principle}} {{arises in}} a film projector. In this application, {{it is necessary to}} advance the film in a jerky, stepwise motion, in which each frame of film stops for {{a fraction of a second}} in front of the projector lens, and then much more quickly the film is moved to the next frame. This can be done using a mechanism in which the rotation of a Reuleaux triangle within a square is used to create a motion pattern for an actuator that pulls the film quickly to each new frame and then pauses the film's motion while the frame is projected.|$|E
5|$|The Lake Hefner Parkway {{opened in}} 1992. SH-74 was {{transferred}} to the new freeway on April 6. Between April and July 2001, ODOT installed a Brifen Safety Fence cable barrier along the Lake Hefner Parkway section of SH-74. This installation was the first <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> barrier design in the United States. The freeway was extended from its former terminus just north of the Kilpatrick Turnpike to 164th Street in 2016.|$|E

5|$|Photochromic lenses include silver halides, so that {{ultraviolet}} light in natural daylight liberates metallic silver, darkening the lenses. The silver halides are reformed in lower light intensities. Colourless silver chloride films {{are used in}} radiation detectors. Zeolite sieves incorporating Ag+ ions are used to desalinate seawater during rescues, using silver ions to precipitate chloride as silver chloride. Silver is also used for its antibacterial properties for water sanitisation, but the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> is limited by limits on silver consumption. Colloidal silver is similarly used to disinfect closed swimming pools; while it {{has the advantage of}} not giving off a smell like hypochlorite treatments do, colloidal silver is not effective enough for more contaminated open swimming pools. Small silver iodide crystals are used in cloud seeding to cause rain.|$|E

25|$|One <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> is Ampère's force law, which {{describes}} how two current-carrying wires can attract or repel each other, since each experiences a Lorentz force from the other's magnetic field. For more information, see the article: Ampère's force law.|$|E

25|$|By the {{fundamental}} theorem of arithmetic, every positive integer greater than 1 {{has a unique}} prime factorization.

25|$|A curious {{meteorological}} <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> theorem involves {{considering the}} wind as a vector defined at every point continuously {{over the surface}} of a planet with an atmosphere. As an idealisation, take wind to be a two-dimensional vector: suppose that relative to the planetary diameter of the Earth, its vertical (i.e., non-tangential) motion is negligible.|$|E
25|$|This {{is because}} one can always {{reduce the number}} of {{variables}} by substituting zero for some variables, and one can increase the number of variables by applying the homomorphisms n; the definition of those homomorphisms assures that n(P(X1,,X'n))=P(X1,,X'n+1) (and similarly for Q) whenever n'd. See a proof of Newton's identities for an effective <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> principle.|$|E
25|$|If {{data are}} {{represented}} by a statistical model specifying a particular family of probability distributions, then estimates of the median {{can be obtained by}} fitting that family of probability distributions to the data and calculating the theoretical median of the fitted distribution.

25|$|The largest scale <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{technology}} is the conversion of acetylene to ethylene in refineries. The steam cracking of alkanes yields a few percent acetylene, which is selectively hydrogenated {{in the presence of}} a palladium/silver catalyst. For more complex alkynes, the Lindlar catalyst is widely recommended to avoid formation of the alkane, for example in the conversion of phenylacetylene to styrene.|$|E

25|$|The Supreme Court has {{developed}} a four-part analysis to evaluate the constitutionality of time, place and manner (TPM) restrictions.
