5|$|A {{doctoral}} student of Curie, Marguerite Perey, {{became the first}} woman elected to membership in the Academy– over half a century later, in 1962. Despite Curie's fame as a scientist working for France, the public's attitude tended toward xenophobia—the same that had led to the Dreyfus affair–which also fueled false speculation that Curie was Jewish. During the French Academy of Sciences elections, she was vilified by the right wing press who criticised her for being a foreigner and an atheist. Her daughter later remarked on the public hypocrisy <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>French</b> press often portrayed Curie as an unworthy foreigner when she was nominated for a French honour, but would portray her as a French hero when she received a foreign one such as her Nobel Prizes.|$|E
50|$|The European {{continent}} {{is heavily}} dominated by Indo-European languages, {{all of which}} have a past tense. In some cases the tense is formed inflectionally as in English see/saw or walks/walked and <b>as</b> in <b>the</b> <b>French</b> imperfect form, and sometimes it is formed periphrastically, <b>as</b> in <b>the</b> <b>French</b> passé composé form. Further, all of the non-Indo-European languages in Europe, such as Basque, Hungarian, and Finnish, also have a past tense.|$|R

Upon graduation, he began to work for his uncle, just <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>French</b> and Indian War (1754–1763) had begun. Thomas Hancock had close relations with the royal governors of Massachusetts and secured profitable government contracts during the war. John Hancock learned much about his uncle's business during these years and was trained for eventual partnership in the firm. Hancock worked hard, but he also enjoyed {{playing the role of}} a wealthy aristocrat and developed a fondness for expensive clothes.|$|E
5|$|As allied {{intentions}} became clear, General Pigot {{decided to}} redeploy his {{forces in a}} defensive posture, withdrawing troops from Conanicut Island and from Butts Hill. He also decided to move nearly all livestock into the city, ordered the levelling of orchards to provide a clear line of fire, and destroyed carriages and wagons. The arriving French ships drove several of his supporting ships aground, which were then burned to prevent their capture. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>French</b> worked {{their way up the}} channel toward Newport, Pigot ordered the remaining ships scuttled to hamper French access to Newport's harbour. On 8 August d'Estaing moved the bulk of his fleet into Newport Harbour.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{domestic}} opposition, internal demoralization, and international hostility, Gaddafi assumed a more conciliatory attitude following his defeat. On the other side, Habré also found himself vulnerable, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>French</b> {{feared that the}} attack on Maatan as-Sarrah was only {{the first stage of}} a general offensive into Libya proper, a possibility that France was not disposed to tolerate. As a result, Mitterrand forced Habré to accept the mediation efforts of the Organization of African Unity's Zambian Chairman, Kenneth Kaunda, which resulted in a ceasefire on September 11.|$|E

5|$|During the Seven Years' War (in America, known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>French</b> and Indian War), British forces seized Canada {{from the}} French, but the francophone {{population}} remained politically {{isolated from the}} southern colonies. Excluding the Native Americans, who were being conquered and displaced, the 13 British colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, about one-third that of Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the {{rate of natural increase}} was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas. The colonies' distance from Britain had allowed the development of self-government, but their success motivated monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority.|$|E
5|$|During the day, Boadicea {{continued}} to close until Victor {{was forced to}} abandon Ceylon and sail in support of Vénus at 15:30. As soon <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>French</b> prize crew was removed, Lieutenant Philip Fitz Gibbon, the remaining officer on Ceylon, rehoisted British colours and assumed control of the ship. This allowed Boadicea to sail past the recaptured frigate and engage the French ships directly, reaching Vénus at 16:40. Hamelin recognised that the battered state of his flagship meant {{that he would not}} be able to adequately defend against Rowley's attack and ordered Victor to take news of his defeat back to Port Napoleon. Readying his ship for a token action, Hamelin fired at Boadicea as she came up but was forced to surrender within ten minutes.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, the French dangerously underestimated Austrian {{tenacity}} {{and military}} skill. The white coats, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>French</b> called the Austrians, were far better soldiers than the French assumed, and despite such demonstrations as that at Ostrach, Stockach and Winterthur, the French {{continued to hold}} this prejudice. This did not change until 1809 when the Battle of Aspern-Essling and the Battle of Wagram {{a few weeks later}} caused Napoleon to revise his opinion of the Austrian military.|$|E

5|$|Great Britain {{secured the}} {{territory}} in 1763 after their victory over France in the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War, better known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>French</b> and Indian War in North America; lasting from 1754 to 1763. The {{founding of the}} first agricultural community and settlements in 1812 by Lord Selkirk, north of the area which is now downtown Winnipeg, led to conflict between British colonists and the Métis. Twenty colonists, including the governor, and one Métis {{were killed in the}} Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816. Thomas Spence attempted to be President of the Republic of Manitobah in 1867, that he and his council named.|$|E
5|$|In January 1936, Syrian {{nationalist}} sentiments became incensed <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>French</b> authorities suspended {{parliament and}} appointed the pro-French president Taj al-Din al-Hasani. Following {{the arrest of}} some nationalist leaders, a general strike was declared against the French Mandate and President al-Hasani. Speeches denouncing the arrests and colonialism were made at the Umayyad Mosque, after which demonstrators, including students and local youths, gathered at al-Bakri's home where they coordinated a march to the Serail (French government headquarters). The protests were led by al-Bakri, al-Quwatli and Jamil Mardam Bey, but they were confronted by the security forces before leaving al-Bakri's street.|$|E
5|$|In {{languages}} {{other than}} English, its name also reflects the action it resembles. Sports journalist Alejandro Cisternas, from Chilean newspaper El Mercurio, {{compiled a list}} of these names. In most cases, they either refer to the kick's scissor-like motion, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>French</b> ciseaux retourné (returned scissor) and the Greek psalidaki, or to its bicycle-like action, such as the Portuguese pontapé de bicicleta. In other languages, the nature of the action is described: German Fallrückzieher (falling backward kick), Polish przewrotka (overturn kick), Dutch omhaal (turnaround drag), and Italian rovesciata (reversed kick).|$|E
