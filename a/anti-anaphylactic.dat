The <b>anti-anaphylactic</b> activity of compound 1 (10, 25 and 50 mg/Kg) was studied by using models such as passive cutaneous anaphylaxis, passive paw anaphylaxis and also investigated for its anti-inflammatory activity against the carrageenin induced paw edema and cotton pellet granuloma in albino rats. A dose-dependent beneficial effect was observed on the leakage of Evans Blue dye in skin challenged with antigen and on paw anaphylaxis induced by antiserum. The compound 1 also exhibited a significant (p < 0. 01) inhibition of rat paw edema and granuloma tissue formation, including significant protection of RBC against the hemolytic effect of hypotonic solution, an indication of membrane-stabilizing activity. <b>Anti-anaphylactic</b> activity of compound 1 may be possibly due to the inhibition of releasing various inflammatory mediators.

In the current study, aqueous extract of green tea (C. sinensis) was evaluated for mast cell stabilizing and <b>anti-anaphylactic</b> activities. Green tea extract (11, 13, 15 mg/ml) significantly (P< 0. 05) inhibited compound 48 / 80 -induced rat mesentric mast cell degranulation in a dose dependent manner. <b>Anti-anaphylactic</b> activity of green tea extract was performed in female mice. At a dose of 400, 500, 600 mg/kg BW, green tea extract showed significant reduction in the mortality of mice subjected to anaphylactic shock by compound C 48 / 80. Ketotifen was used for comparison. In addition, IR and UV–Visible spectroscopy analysis of green tea extract revealed the presence of functional groups of bioactive compounds.

40|$|Hydrocortisone and the glucocorticoid-induced anti-phospholipase protein macrocortin, {{were tested}} as inhibitors of PAF generation.

Neither agent had any effect on the acetylation of lyso-PAF to PAF. Of other drugs tested only phospholipase inhibitors blocked lyso-PAF release and sulphydryl reagents blocked the acetylation step.

40|$|Immediate-type {{allergic}} reactions in man, rat and guinea-pig were inhibited by disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) and by β-adrenergic stimulant drugs like isoprenaline and salbutamol. Isoprenaline, like DSCG, inhibited {{the release of}} pharmacological mediators of immediate-type allergy. This <b>anti-anaphylactic</b> effect was shown in vivo in passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA). It was also shown in the dextran-induced anaphylactoid reaction in the rat, suggesting a common pathway between this response and the true anaphylactic reaction. The dextran response in rats may perhaps be a useful screening test for potential <b>anti-anaphylactic</b> agents. Both DSCG and isoprenaline inhibited histamine release {{in a variety of}} in vitro test systems. In lung tissue they inhibited histamine release mediated by human reagins as well as the release of histamine mediated by γ 1 antibodies in guinea-pig. The inhibition by DSCG of histamine release from guinea-pig lung contrasts with its reported lack of ability to inhibit guinea-pig PCA, and does not support the view that it specifically inhibits reactions initiated by the interaction of reaginic antibodies with antigen. Isoprenaline was at least 1000 times as potent as DSCG in all the test systems, including PCA and dextran response in rat. Thus the β-adrenergic sympathomimetics are potent protective agents against anaphylactic reactions, and should not be considered only as agents producing symptomatic relief of bronchospasm in asthma...|$|E

40|$|Asthma is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disease of airways with widespread narrowing of air passage {{which may be}} relieved spontaneously or {{as a result of}} therapy and, clinically it is characterized by paroxysms of dyspnea, cough and wheezing. Inflammation and broncho-constriction are the two major hallmarks in the pathology of Asthma. Shirishadi is a polyherbal drug used in the management of bronchial asthma by Ayurvedic practitioners from decades. Shirisha (Albezzia lebbeck), Nagarmotha (Cyprus rotandus) and Kantakari (Solanum xanthocarpum) are the ingredient herbs of this compound. Hence, the present investigation was undertaken to evaluate the bronchodilator and <b>anti-anaphylactic</b> activity of Shirishadi Polyherbal compound. Experimental models studied were egg albumin induced anaphylaxis in guinea pigs and Anti-Cholinergic activity was studied on Isolated Frog Heart and Frog Rectus Muscle. The extract produced 30 + 0. 23 % inhibition in maximum contraction produced by Acetylcholine which is much less than that produced by standard drug (99. 9 %), moreover the dose of extract that produced the visible effect is much higher than that used for therapeutic purpose suggesting that antiasthmatic effect of drug is not due to Acetylcholine antagonism activity. Neither Acetylcholine efficacy nor its potency decreases significantly with increasing dose of drug. Drug increased the cardiac tone and stimulate the cardiac contractility but unable to prevail over complete inhibition of heart rate produced by Acetylcholine. The drug produced significant protection against egg albumin induced anaphylactic shock characterized by decrease in intensity and delay in the development of symptoms of dyspnoea, asphyxia and collapse.

The effect was more marked in non-infected wheezy bronchitis (83 · 55 % response) than in bronchial asthma (56 · 5 % response), perhaps because factors such as leukotrienes, prostaglandins and thromboxanes tend to produce a sustained bronchoconstriction in the latter condition. Ketotifen was not associated with any adverse effects and did not cause behavioural problems. Patients found it palatable and acceptable. The main disadvantage was that symptoms recurred within days of stopping treatment.

40|$|Abstract In {{traditional}} {{systems of}} medicine, many {{plants have been}} documented to be useful {{for the treatment of}} various respiratory disorders including asthma. In the last two decades the use of medicinal plants and natural products has been increased dramatically all over the world. Current synthetic drugs used in pharmacotherapy of asthma are unable to act at all the stages and targets of asthma. However some herbal alternatives employed in asthma are proven to provide symptomatic relief and assist in the inhibition of disease progression also. The herbs have shown interesting results in various target specific biological activities such as bronchodilation, mast cell stabilization, <b>anti-anaphylactic,</b> anti-inflammatory, anti-spasmodic, anti-allergic, immunomodulatory and inhibition of mediators such as leukotrienes, lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenase, platelet activating, phosphodiesterase and cytokine, in the treatment of asthma.

40|$|Anaphylaxis is {{the number}} one {{emergency}} situation in allergy. More than 100 yearsafter its first description, there are still many problems and open questions regarding pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Many national and international societies have edited guidelines that give clear recommendations for acute treatment, showing algorithms depending on the severity of the clinical symptomatology, which can be graded rather simply. 1 Adrenaline {{has been shown to be}} the most important drug to be applied, and the intramuscular route has a clear-cut advantage over other ways of administration in the initial phase. Recently, the World Allergy Organization has published a position statement on epinephrine application as a World Allergy Organization Report. 2 Although things seem pretty clear at a superficial glance, there are some controver-sies in detail with regard to when in the very early stage of anaphylaxis adrenaline should be given.

3000|$|... 4 H-Pyran {{derivatives}} {{have been}} as a valuable class of heterocyclic compounds, which are extensively distributed in nature [9]. The fused pyran ring skeleton is considered as a famous heterocyclic compound and also as a significant framework of many natural products. In recent years, pyran and fused pyran derivatives have received the most attention owing to their association with {{the various types of}} biological and pharmaceutical characteristics [10]. The Pyran derivatives reveal interesting medicinal properties, including antimicrobial [11], antifungal [12], antitumor [13], anticoagulant, and <b>anti-anaphylactic</b> activities [14]. Moreover, these heterocyclic compounds exhibit potentially positive effects in the treatment of the neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson, Huntington, and Alzheimer, as well as AIDS-associated dementia [15]. These heterocyclic compounds are also applied in preparation of cosmetics, pigments and photoactive materials [16]. The drug structures with high surface-volume ratio display substantial improvement of solubility which cause stronger therapeutic effect. So, nano- or micro-sized drugs due to their high surface-volume ratio cause increasing of the drug adsorption and improving the curative characteristic. Accordingly, the development of several new methods to synthesize the nano-sized drugs is an significant challenge for both chemist and pharmacist. Several methods, including micronization, modification of polymorphic configuration, expansion of oil-based solutions, smart application of co-solvents, application of stabilizing agents, microemulsions, and creation of solid dispersions have been offered for the synthesis of nano-sized drug compounds.|$|E
40|$|<b>Anti-anaphylactic</b> {{effect of}} sinomenine was studied in guinea-pigs {{sensitized}} with bovine serum. Fairly constant severity of shock was {{obtained in the}} control animals by determining challenging dose based on Prof. Ogata's so-called binding zone: the highest mutiplication of the antigen giving positive reaction with the highest dilution of the antibody. Standard dose for challenge was calculated by the formula. body weight (g) × 1 / 13 × 1 /binding zone. Sinomenine was effective in preventing the guinea-pig's anaphylactic shock, but not so remarkably. Five daily subcutaneous injections of 50 mg/kg sinomenine were required to prevent death from the active anaphylactic shock induced by the standard antigen dose. Under this pretreatment only about half number of the animals have survived death from the passive anaphylaxis shocked by the same antigen dose. Therefore, sinomenine seemed to be less effective in preventing guinea-pig anaphylaxis than canine anaphylaxis, against which marked protection was observed by one of us (R. N.) In the guinea-pig injected sinomenine 50 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days, histamine content of skin of the head region was reduced by ca. 26 %, but no reduction was observed in the abdominal skin and lung tissues. This degree of histamine release was much less than in the dog. The guinea-pig became more susceptible to histamine after the repeated injection of sinomenine, but this phenomenon is not specific to this species. Sinomenine did not inhibit the precipitin reaction in the guinea-pig anaphylaxis. From these, it may be concluded that the protective effect of sinomenine against guinea-pig anaphylaxis is less marked than against canine anaphylaxis and this is chiefly due to lesser ability of sinomenine in releasing histamine in this species...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} made of the effect of anit-histamine, {{antiserotonin}} and of different <b>anti-anaphylactic</b> drugs on PCA reactions induced in mice with IgG 1 or IgE. Further, using the ability of mouse IgE to sensitize rat mast cells, a comparative study was also made of PCA reactions induced in mice and rats with mouse IgE. Antihistamines produced a partial inhibition of PCA reactions induced in mice with mouse IgG 1 or IgE and in rats with mouse IgE whereas antiserotonin inhibited PCA reactions induced in rats with mouse IgE, but had no effect on PCA reactions induced in mice with mouse IgG 1 or IgE. The simultaneous use of antihistamine and antiserotonin resulted in a total inhibition of PCA reactions induced in mice with IgG 1 and in a marked but not total inhibition of PCA reaction due to IgE; PCA reactions induced in rats with mouse IgE were totally inhibited. Compounds known to change the intracellular level of cyclic AMP were found to have little or no effect on PCA reactions induced in mice with either IgG 1 or IgE in spite of producing a complete marked inhibition of PCA reactions induced with mouse IgE in rats. Diethylcarbamazine or disodium cromoglycate were also very effective inhibitors of rat PCA reactions induced with mouse IgE although having no effect on PCA reaction induced in mice with this same antibody or with IgG 1. Thus, in spite of sharing common mediators released from the same type of target cell sensitized with the same type of antibody, PCA reactions induced in mice and rats with mouse IgE reacted very differently to the pharmacological effect of most of the drugs tested. This fact seems to indicate that the physiological mechanism operating in mouse mast cells are different from those operating in rat mast cells...|$|E
40|$|After injecting {{intravenously}} {{an appropriate}} {{dose of the}} antigen serum calculated from the binding zone and the blood volume by Ogata's antibody dilution method to 23 dogs sensitized with bovine serum, {{it was possible to}} bring about the maximum fall of blood pressure well over 80 per cent (average, 88. 8 per cent) within 30 minutes. In the case of other 21 sensitized dogs given intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg Benadryl 30 minutes prior to the reinjection, the maximum fall of blood pressure in 1 - 79 per cent (average, 43 per cent) was elicited after injecting the same dose of the antigen; and in a few instances the fall of blood pressure was practically protected. Such a suppressive effect of Benadryl was evidently more marked than the effect on the blood pressure fall induced by histamine. In Benadryl-treated dogs, a rise of the portal pressure in anaphylaxis was slower and milder although the inhibition of the elevation by histamine was more complete. Benadryl in anaphylaxis showed a more incomplete inhibition on the acceleration of the lymph flow from the thoracic duct and on the increase in protein of the lymph than that on the similar changes induced by histamine. The duration of incoagulation of the lymph in anaphylaxis was shortened in Benadryl-treated dogs. When Benadryl was added to antibody serum in vitro or in vivo (by intravenous injection), the precipitin reaction (by the method of diluting antibody) was suppressed. In the case of sensitized dogs previously injected with Benadryl, after antigen reinjection a considerable amount of antibody (precipitin) not consumed in reaction remained in circulating blood, gradually decreasing up to 48 hours later; whereas in unprotected dogs precipitin was found to have disappeared promptly after the reinjection. These findings indicate that Benadryl inhibits the union of antigen and antibody through some reversible means. Consequently, it appears that this <b>anti-anaphylactic</b> effect of Benadryl observed in dogs is caused not solely by the counteraction against histamine being released. The fact that Benadryl has only shown a much weaker inhibition on the congestion of the liver as reflected by the increase in portal pressure and thoracic lymph flow than that on the fall of arterial pressure suggests that the sluice reaction of hepatic vein is caused by "intrinsic histamine" released and/or some smooth muscle stimulating factors other than histamine...|$|E
