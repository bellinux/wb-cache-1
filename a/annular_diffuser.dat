Blade surface velocities over the entire blade are approximated, based on {{the rate of change}} of angular momentum. This gives a three-dimensional flow picture based on a two-dimensional analysis.

The diffuser where the measurements were made is a scaled down model of a 10 MW gas turbine, built by GE/Nuovo Pignone. In a previous paper (Desideri and Manfrida, 1995) 2 -D turbulence and velocity measurements were presented with axial inlet velocity conditions.

Turbulence characteristics were determined by means of two hot split-film probes, which allowed measuring axial, radial and tangential components of the mean velocity and their fluctuating components. The measuring point is moved inside the diffuser by means of two step-motors, which allow the rotation of the hub and the radial displacement of the probe.

40|$|Two <b>annular</b> <b>diffusers</b> {{downstream}} of a nacelle-mounted fan {{were tested}} for aerodynamic performance, {{measured in terms}} of two static pressure recovery parameters (one near the diffuser exit plane and one about three diameters downstream in the settling duct) in the presence of several inflow conditions. The two diffusers each had an inlet diameter of 1. 84 m, an area ratio of 2. 3, and an equivalent cone angle of 11. 5, but were distinguished by centerbodies of different lengths. The dependence of diffuser performance on various combinations of swirling, radially distorted, and/or azimuthally distorted inflow was examined. Swirling flow and distortions in the axial velocity profile in the annulus upstream of the diffuser inlet were caused by the intrinsic flow patterns downstream of a fan in a duct and by artificial intensification of the distortions. Azimuthal distortions or defects were generated by the addition of four artificial devices (screens and fences). Pressure recovery data indicated beneficial effects of both radial distortion (for a limited range of distortion levels) and inflow swirl. Small amounts of azimuthal distortion created by the artificial devices produced only small effects on diffuser performance. A large artificial distortion device was required to produce enough azimuthal flow distortion to significantly degrade the diffuser static pressure recovery...|$|R

Two experimental run segments have been completed so far during FY- 95 involving flow visualization and diffuser performance evaluation based on Kinetic Energy Dissipation.

The velocity distribution shows high velocity fluids shifted and accumulated at the concave wall of the exit section due to the combined effect of velocity diffusion and centrifugal action. It also indicates the possible development of secondary motions between the concave and convex walls of the test diffuser. The maximum values of the mass average static pressure recovery and total pressure loss are 27 % and 18 % compared to the predicted results of 31 % and 21 % respectively, which shows a good agreement between the experimental and predicted results. From the parametric investigation it is observed that static pressure recovery increases up to an area ratio of 2 and pressure recovery decreases steadily up to angle of turn 75 º.

40|$|Abstract: A row of airfoil-shaped {{support struts}} has been {{proposed}} to be installed {{on both sides of}} the rotor, so as to remedy the configuration asymmetry of a conventional fully reversible fan in its forward and reverse flow modes. In the forward mode, the upstream support struts act as inlet guide vanes (GVs), and the downstream ones as outlet GVs; whereas in the reverse mode, the roles played by the two support-strut rows switch over. Among the five representative airfoils, sym-metric airfoil NACA 0012 - 64 is found to be the most suitable airfoil used as the section of the two rows of the airfoil-shaped support struts. Detailed numerical investigations on four such new fans, whose design points cover a wide range, reveal that the installation of the two rows of blades improves the performance of the new type fan, when compared with the one-rotor fully reversible axial-flow fan without such support-struts. The upstream blade row has little influence on the direction of incoming flow and causes little aerodynamic losses. By contrast, the downstream blade row plays an important role in efficiency improvements: (1) the downstream blade row, which acts as outlet GVs, significantly reduces the rotor-exit tangential velocity and recovers part of the swirl energy in the flow downstream of the rotor, although sometimes the aerodynamic losses caused by such support-strut-like outlet GVs may be high at a large incidence; (2) due to the obviously reduced tangential components of the flow velocities downstream of the outlet GV, the air travels a much shorter distance toward the exit of the <b>annular</b> <b>diffuser,</b> compared with that in the fan without outlet GVs. This leads to a markedly reduced friction loss. In addition, the larger the equivalent divergence angle of the <b>annular</b> <b>diffuser</b> is, the more effectively does the installa-tion of the two rows of the support-strut-like blade improve the performance of the new type fans...|$|E
40|$|The {{internal}} flow {{and the performance}} of an <b>annular</b> <b>diffuser</b> composed of a cylindrical casing and a conical hub were examined experimentally. When the flow has no whirl component at the inlet, the optimum convergent angle of the hub, giving the best pressure recovery, is about 24 degrees. But with an increment of the whirl component, the component roughly changes to the free vortex pattern at the downstream passage independent of the initial flow pattern and the axial velocity is faster near the hub side than near the casing side. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the separation by giving an adequate whirl component at the inlet, even if it occurs at the hub wall with a large convergent angle in the case without the whirl component. When the whirl component becomes stronger, a reverse flow occurs along the hub wall at the definite area ratio irrespective of the convergent angle...|$|E

An analysis of non-axisymmetric flow in an <b>annular</b> <b>diffuser</b> is presented, based on an inviscid rotational core flow plus {{the use of a}} diffuser effective area ratio to account for boundary layer blockage. The analysis is applied to the prediction of the diffuser flow field associated with the presence of a circumferential total pressure distortion. It is found that large static pressure non-uniformities can exist at the inlet of diffusers that are short compared with their mean circumferences, as is usually the case in turbomachinely applications. The analysis is coupled to an asymmetric compressor flow field prediction to provide a method for calculating the effect of an exit diffuser on compressor performance with distortion. It is shown that the velocity defect seen by the compressor can be substantially increascd by the presence of the diffuser. The experiments were directed at assessing the method used to predict the flow in the diffuser.

Symmetrical exit velocity profiles were unstable, with a tendency to shift back to hub- or tip-weighted profile. Diffuser effectiveness was increased from about 47 percent without suction to over 85 percent at a total suction rate of about 14 percent. The diffuser total pressure losses at inlet Mach numbers of 0. 18 and 0. 41 decreased from 1. 1 and 5. 6 percent without suction to 0. 48 and 5. 2 percent at total suction rates of 14. 4 and 5. 6 percent, respectively...|$|R

The experimental results then were numerically validated {{with the help of}} Fluent and then a series of parametric investigations are conducted with same centre line length and inlet diameter but with different area ratios varying from 1. 15 to 3. 75. The measurements were taken at Reynolds number 2. 15 x 105 based on inlet diameter and mass average inlet velocity. Predicted results of coefficient of mass averaged static pressure recovery (31 %) and coefficient of mass averaged total pressure loss (21 %) are in good agreement with the experimental results of coefficient of mass averaged static pressure recovery (27 %) and coefficient of mass averaged total pressure loss (17 %) respectively. Standard k-ε model in Fluent solver was chosen for validation. From the parametric investigation it is observed that static pressure recovery increases up to an area ratio of 2. 86 and between the area ration 2. 86 to 3. 75, pressure recovery decreases steadily. The coefficient of total pressure loss almost remains constant with the change in area ratio for similar inlet conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{the present}} {{investigation}} the distribution of mean velocity, static pressure and total pressure are experimentally studied on an <b>annular</b> curved <b>diffuser</b> of 37. 5 ° angle of turn with an area ratio of 1. 273 at Reynolds number 1. 85 x 10 5 based on inlet diameter and mass average inlet velocity. The experimental results then were numerically validated {{with the help of}} Fluent and then a series of parametric investigations are conducted with same centre line length and inlet diameter but with different area ratios varying from 1. 25 to 2. 0 with change in angle of turn from 30 º to 75 º. The velocity distribution shows high velocity fluids shifted and accumulated at the concave wall of the exit section due to the combined effect of velocity diffusion and centrifugal action. It also indicates the possible development of secondary motions between the concave and convex walls of the test diffuser. The maximum values of the mass average static pressure recovery and total pressure loss are 27 % and 18 % compared to the predicted results of 31 % and 21 % respectively, which shows a good agreement between the experimental and predicted results. From the parametric investigation it is observed that static pressure recovery increases up to an area ratio of 2 and pressure recovery decreases steadily up to angle of turn 75 º. The coefficient of total pressure loss almost remains constant with the change in area ratio and angle of turn for similar inlet condition...|$|R
