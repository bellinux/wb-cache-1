50|$|A {{number of}} {{mechanisms}} cause carbapenem {{resistance in the}} Enterobacteriaceae. These include hyperproduction of <b>ampC</b> <b>beta-lactamase</b> with an outer membrane porin mutation, CTX-M extended-spectrum beta-lactamase with a porin mutation or drug efflux, and carbapenemase production. The most important mechanism of resistance by CRKP is {{the production of a}} carbapenemase enzyme, blakpc. The gene that encodes the blakpc enzyme is carried on a mobile piece of genetic material (a transposon; the specific transposon involved is called Tn4401), which increases the risk for dissemination. CRE can be difficult to detect because some strains that harbor blakpc have minimum inhibitory concentrations that are elevated, but still within the susceptible range for carbapenems. Because these strains are susceptible to carbapenems, they are not identified as potential clinical or infection control risks using standard susceptibility testing guidelines. Patients with unrecognized CRKP colonization have been reservoirs for transmission during nosocomial outbreaks. Depending on the type of infection and the mode of infectivity, cells of Klebsiella spp. may adhere and attack upper respiratory tract epithelial cells, cells in gastrointestinal tract, endothelial cells, or uroepithelial cells, followed by colonization of mucosal membranes (phac-aspc.gc.ca).|$|E

To elucidate the mechanism by which resistance suppression occurs, the effect of piperacillin plus tazobactam on the induction of <b>AmpC</b> <b>beta-lactamase</b> was analyzed by monitoring the beta-galactosidase activity of an inducible ampC-lacZ gene fusion in Escherichia coli. The combination exerted no inhibitory effect on <b>AmpC</b> <b>beta-lactamase</b> induction. Tazobactam also {{had no effect on}} the accumulation of a key intermediate in the <b>AmpC</b> <b>beta-lactamase</b> induction pathway, 1, 6 -anhydromurotripeptide, in an ampD mutant strain of E. coli. However, the addition of tazobactam to liquid cultures of E. cloacae 40001 in the presence of piperacillin at four times the MIC caused a delay in the recovery of the culture to piperacillin-induced stress. At 16 times the MIC, a complete suppression of regrowth occurred. Analysis of culture viability on piperacillin plates showed that the culture recovery was due to growth by moderately resistant mutants preexisting in the cell population, which at 16 times the MIC became susceptible to the combination. Evidence from the kinetics of inhibition of the E. cloacae 40001 <b>AmpC</b> <b>beta-lactamase</b> by clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam and from the effects of these drugs on the frequency of resistance to piperacillin suggests that the suppressive effect of tazobactam on the appearance of resistance is primarily mediated by the beta-lactamase inhibitory activity...|$|E

40|$|Citrobacter freundii encodes an {{inducible}} chromosomal beta-lactamase {{similar to}} the constitutively expressed <b>ampC</b> <b>beta-lactamase</b> of Escherichia coli. In the latter species the ampC gene is located next to the fumarate reductase (frd) operon, whereas in C. freundii the ampC gene {{is known to be}} separated from frd by 1100 base pairs. This intervening DNA segment carries a gene, ampR, coding for a 31 -kilodalton polypeptide. The cloned C. freundii OS 60 ampC gene is inducible by beta-lactam antibiotics in E. coli, but only in the presence of an intact ampR gene.

There is a worldwide {{increase in the}} reported incidence of resistant microorganisms; therefore, surveillance programs are important to define resistance patterns of GN microorganisms causing BSIs. The objective {{of this study was}} to describe the clinical and microbiological features of resistant GN BSIs in a tertiary pediatric hospital in Turkey. MethodsPatients between 1 month and 18 years of age hospitalized between January 2005 and December 2012 were included in this study. The presence of ESBL and <b>AmpC</b> type <b>beta-lactamase</b> activity were evaluated using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) disk diffusion and double-disk synergy tests. ResultsA total of 209 resistant GN bacterial BSI episodes were identified in 192 patients. Of 192 children, 133 (69. 2 %) were aged ≤ 48 months of age. Sixty-six (31. 6 %) of the BSIs were considered community-acquired and 143 (68. 4 %) were hospital-acquired infections. The most common isolates were non-fermenting GN bacteria (n= 117, 55. 9 %). The major causative pathogens were Pseudomonas spp. in non-fermenting GN bacteria. The resistance rates to imipenem for Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. were 40. 5 % and 41. 6 %, respectively. The most common isolates in fatal patients were Pseudomonas spp. followed by Escherichia coli. The overall 28 -day mortality rate was 16. 3 %.

40|$|Bacterial {{expression}} of beta-lactamases {{is the most}} widespread resistance mechanism to beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins. There is a pressing need for novel, non-beta-lactam inhibitors of these enzymes. One previously discovered novel inhibitor of the <b>beta-lactamase</b> <b>AmpC,</b> compound 1, has several favorable properties: it is chemically dissimilar to beta-lactams and is a noncovalent, competitive inhibitor of the enzyme. However, at 26 microM its activity is modest. Using the X-ray structure of the AmpC/ 1 complex as a template, 14 analogues were designed and synthesized. The most active of these, compound 10, had a K(i) of 1 microM, 26 -fold better than the lead. To understand the origins of this improved activity, the structures of AmpC in complex with compound 10 and an analogue, compound 11, were determined by X-ray crystallography to 1. 97 and 1. 96 A, respectively. Compound 10 was active in cell culture, reversing resistance to the third generation cephalosporin ceftazidime in bacterial pathogens expressing AmpC. In contrast to beta-lactam-based inhibitors clavulanate and cefoxitin, compound 10 did not up-regulate beta-lactamase expression in cell culture but simply inhibited the enzyme expressed by the resistant bacteria. Its escape from this resistance mechanism derives from its dissimilarity to beta-lactam antibiotics...|$|R
40|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that the modification of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) to reduce their affinity for beta-lactams is an important mechanism (target modification) by which Gram-positive cocci acquire antibiotic resistance. Among Gram-negative rods (GNR), however, this mechanism has been considered unusual, and restricted to clinically irrelevant laboratory mutants for most species. Using as a model Pseudomonas aeruginosa, {{high up on the}} list of pathogens causing life-threatening infections in hospitalized patients worldwide, we show that PBPs may also {{play a major role in}} beta-lactam resistance in GNR, but through a totally distinct mechanism. Through a detailed genetic investigation, including whole-genome analysis approaches, we demonstrate that high-level (clinical) beta-lactam resistance in vitro, in vivo, and in the clinical setting is driven by the inactivation of the dacB-encoded nonessential PBP 4, which behaves as a trap target for beta-lactams. The inactivation of this PBP is shown to determine a highly efficient and complex beta-lactam resistance response, triggering overproduction of the chromosomal <b>beta-lactamase</b> <b>AmpC</b> and the specific activation of the CreBC (BlrAB) two-component regulator, which in turn plays a major role in resistance. These findings are a major step forward in our understanding of beta-lactam resistance biology, and, more importantly, they open up new perspectives on potential antibiotic targets for the treatment of infectious diseases...|$|R

Aim of the study: This study was undertaken to detect ESBL, <b>AmpC</b> <b>beta-lactamase</b> and metallo-beta-lactamase producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species from the endotracheal aspirates. Materials and Methods: A prospective study was performed {{over a period of}} 15 month in a tertiary care hospital. A total of 26 clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa and 40 of Acinetobacter species were tested for the presence of ESBL, <b>AmpC</b> <b>beta-lactamase,</b> and metallo-beta-lactamase enzyme. Detection of ESBL was done by the combined disk diffusion method as per Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines, and MBL was detected by imipenem-Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) combined disk method. Isolates showing reduced susceptibility to cefoxitin (30 μg) disk were considered ′screen positive′ for AmpC beta-lactamases and selected for detection of plasmid-mediated AmpC by the AmpC disk test. Results : 42. 30 % isolates of P. aeruginosa were positive for ESBL while 53. 85 % were MBL producers. Among 39 isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii, 43. 59 % were AmpC producers while 48. 72 % were MBL-producing strains. Conclusion: The study emphasizes the high prevalence of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii producing beta-lactamase enzymes of diverse mechanisms. Thus, proper antibiotic policy and measures to restrict the indiscriminative use of cephalosporins and carbapenems should be taken to minimize the emergence of this multiple beta-lactamase-producing pathogens...|$|E

The {{aim of the}} current study was to determine this rate at the Bukavu Provincial General Hospital (province of South-Kivu, DRC). Findings. A total of 643 isolates (both from inpatients and outpatients) collected from September 2012 to August 2013 were identified using biochemical methods, and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. The isolates were further screened for Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamases (ESBL) production. <b>Beta-lactamase</b> <b>AmpC</b> phenotype was investigated in 20 antibiotic-resistant isolates. Escherichia coli (58. 5 %), Klebsiella spp. (21. 9 %) and Enterobacter spp. (16. 2 %) were the most frequent uropathogens encountered. Rare uropathogens included Citrobacter spp. Proteus spp. and Acinetobacter spp. Resistance was significantly more present in inpatients isolates (22. 1 % of isolates) when compared to outpatients isolates (8. 4 % of isolates), (p-value < 0. 001). Antibiotic-resistant isolates displayed resistance to common antimicrobial drugs used for UTIs treatment in South Kivu province, namely: ciprofloxacin, ampicillin and third generation cephalosporins. ESBL-phenotype was present in 92. 9 % of antibiotic-resistant isolates. Only amikacin, nitrofurantoin and imipenem displayed satisfactory activity against antibiotic resistant isolates.

The MIC test {{indicates that}} V fischeri is highly resistant to penicillins, and susceptible to cephalosporins. V. fischeri ampC gene was cloned and identified. Nucleotide sequence of an unidentified ufo gene and the ampC, ppiB genes (GenBank Accession No. AY 438037) has been determined; whereas the ampC gene encodes the beta-lactarnase (AmpC) and the ppiB gene encodes the peptidyl-prolyl cis trans isomerase B. Alignment and comparison show that V. fischeri beta-lactamase is homologous to the related species'. The specific amino acid residues STFK (62 nd to 65 th), SDN (122 nd to 124 th), and D (155 th) located 34 residues downstream from the SDN loop {{of the class}} A beta-lactamases are highly conserved, but the KTG is not found. V fischeri <b>ampC</b> gene encoding <b>beta-lactamase</b> has a calculated M-r 31, 181 and comprises 283 amino acid residues (pI 5. 35). There is a signal peptide of 18 amino acid residues MKIKPFLFGLIVLANNAI in the pro-beta-lactamase, which functioned for secretion; thus, the matured protein only has M-r 29, 197 and comprises 265 amino acid residues (pI 4. 95). SDS-PAGE and the beta-lactamase functional assays elicit that the M-r of the beta-lactamases are close to 29 kDa. IEF and the beta-lactamase functional assays show that the beta-lactamases' pi are close to 4. 8 as predicted. The results elucidate that V fischeri ampC gene and the cloned ampC gene in Escherichia coli are the same one. The gene order of the ampC and the related genes is -ufo-(P*-intern) -ampC-ppiB [...] > (P*-intern: intern promoter for sub-regulation), whereas the P*-intern promoter displays the function to lead the ampC gene's expression for stress response.

40|$|Despite {{decades of}} intense study, the {{complementarity}} of beta-lactams for beta-lactamases and penicillin binding proteins is poorly understood. For {{most of these}} enzymes, beta-lactam binding involves rapid formation of a covalent intermediate. This makes measuring the equilibrium between bound and free beta-lactam difficult, effectively precluding measurement of the interaction energy {{between the ligand and}} the enzyme. Here, we explore the energetic complementarity of beta-lactams for the <b>beta-lactamase</b> <b>AmpC</b> through reversible denaturation of adducts of the enzyme with beta-lactams. AmpC from Escherichia coli was reversibly denatured by temperature in a two-state manner with a temperature of melting (Tm) of 54. 6 degrees C and a van't Hoff enthalpy of unfolding (deltaH(VH)) of 182 kcal/mol. Solvent denaturation gave a Gibbs free energy of unfolding in the absence of denaturant (deltaG(u) H 2 O) of 14. 0 kcal/mol. Ligand binding perturbed the stability of the enzyme. The penicillin cloxacillin stabilized AmpC by 3. 2 kcal/mol (deltaTm = + 5. 8 degrees C); the monobactam aztreonam stabilized the enzyme by 2. 7 kcal/mol (deltaTm = + 4. 9 degrees C). Both acylating inhibitors complement the active site. Surprisingly, the oxacephem moxalactam and the carbapenem imipenem both destabilized AmpC, by 1. 8 kcal/mol (deltaTm = - 3. 2 degrees C) and 0. 7 kcal/mol (deltaTm = - 1. 2 degrees C), respectively. These beta-lactams, which share nonhydrogen substituents in the 6 (7) alpha position of the beta-lactam ring, make unfavorable noncovalent interactions with the enzyme. Complexes of AmpC with transition state analog inhibitors were also reversibly denatured; both benzo(b) thiophene- 2 -boronic acid (BZBTH 2 B) and p-nitrophenyl phenylphosphonate (PNPP) stabilized AmpC. Finally, a catalytically inactive mutant of AmpC, Y 150 F, was reversibly denatured. It was 0. 7 kcal/mol (deltaTm = - 1. 3 degrees C) less stable than wild-type (WT) by thermal denaturation. Both the cloxacillin and the moxalactam adducts with Y 150 F were significantly destabilized relative to their WT counterparts, suggesting that this residue plays a role in recognizing the acylated intermediate of the beta-lactamase reaction. Reversible denaturation allows for energetic analyses of the complementarity of AmpC for beta-lactams, through ligand binding, and for itself, through residue substitution. Reversible denaturation may be a useful way to study ligand complementarity to other beta-lactam binding proteins as well...|$|R

40|$|Among the Enterobacteriaceae, Proteus vulgaris is {{exceptional}} in the inducible {{production of}} a 29 -kDa beta-lactamase (cefuroximase) with an unusually high activity towards the beta-lactamase-stable oximino-cephalosporins (e. g. cefuroxime and cefotaxime). Sequencing of the corresponding gene, cumA, showed that the derived CumA beta-lactamase belonged to the molecular class A. The structural gene was under the direct control of gene cumR, which was transcribed backwards and whose initiation codon was 165 bp away {{from that of the}} beta-lactamase gene. This resembled the arrangement of structural and regulator genes ampC and ampR of the 39 -kDa molecular-class-C beta-lactamase AmpC present in many enterobacteria. Moreover, cloned genes ampD and ampG for negative modulation and signal transduction of <b>AmpC</b> <b>beta-lactamase</b> induction, respectively, were also able to restore constitutively CumA overproducing and non-inducible P. vulgaris mutants to the inducible, wild-type phenotype. The results indicate that controls of the induction phenomena are equivalent for the CumA and <b>AmpC</b> <b>beta-lactamase.</b> Very different structural genes can thus be under the control of identical systems.

40|$|Klebsiella spp. {{are among}} the most {{frequently}} isolated bacteria from burn wounds. These organisms {{are among the}} most important opportunistic pathogens, causing hospital-acquired and healthcare-associated infections worldwide. Limited information is available about prevalence of AmpC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae from burn patients. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} determine the characterization of <b>AmpC</b> <b>beta-lactamase</b> among K. pneumoniae isolated from burn patients. Samples were collected from wound specimens of patients with burn injury from a burn hospital in Tehran during 18 months (March 2015 to August 2016). For phenotypic detection of <b>AmpC</b> <b>beta-lactamase,</b> disk diffusion method with cefoxitin was used for screening, AmpC disk test and boronic acid inhibitor-based method were used as confirmatory tests. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to screen all isolates with AmpC genes including ACCM, DHAM, EBCM, FOXM, MOXM, and CITM. Finally, PCR products were validated using sequencing. During this study, 102 isolates of K. pneumoniae were collected. Among these isolates, 52. 9 % suspected as AmpC producer by disk agar diffusion cefoxitin screening method. By confirmatory phenotypic methods, 19. 6 % of isolates considered as AmpC producer. Molecular analysis revealed 43. 1 % of cefoxitin-resistant isolates harbored at least one of the AmpC genes including CITM (22. 5 %), EBCM (21. 5 %), DHAM (7. 8 %), and FOXM (0. 98 %). In addition, 5. 8 % of isolates harbored two AmpC genes and 2. 9 % harbored three AmpC genes. In conclusion, K. pneumoniae is becoming a serious problem in burn patients. Accurate and precise methods and guidelines should be designed for detection of antibiotic-resistant mechanisms. Our data showed the high rate of <b>AmpC</b> <b>beta-lactamase</b> among K. pneumoniae isolated from burn patients, which limit the treatment options. Therefore, the results of this study can provide evidence to help for appropriate treatment of burn patients...|$|E
40|$|Since decades, third-generation {{cephalosporins}} (3 GC) {{are major}} drugs to treat infections due to Enterobacteriaceae; growing resistance to these antibiotics makes important to rapidly detect such resistance. βLACTA™ test is a chromogenic test developed for detecting within 15 minutes 3 GC-resistant isolates from cultures on solid media. A multi-center prospective study conducted in 5 French and Belgian hospitals evaluated {{the performances of}} this test on clinical isolates. Based on antibiotic susceptibility testing, strains resistant or intermediate to cefotaxime or ceftazidime were classified as 3 GC-resistant and molecular characterization of this resistance was performed. The rate of 3 GC-resistance was globally 13. 9 % (332 / 2387), 9. 4 % in Escherichia coli (132 / 1403), 25. 6 % in Klebsiella pneumoniae (84 / 328), 30. 3 % in species naturally producing inducible AmpC beta-lactamases (109 / 360), and 5. 6 % in Klebsiella oxytoca and Citrobacter koseri (7 / 124). The overall sensitivity and specificity of βLACTA™ test were 87. 7 % and 99. 6 % respectively, were 96 and 100 % for E. coli and K. pneumoniae and were 67. 4 % and 99. 6 % for species naturally producing inducible <b>AmpC</b> <b>beta-lactamase.</b> False negative results were mainly related to 3 GC-resistant strains producing <b>AmpC</b> <b>beta-lactamase.</b> Interestingly, the test was positive for all 3 GC-resistant extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing isolates (n= 241). Positive predictive value was 97 % and would remain ≥ 96 % for prevalence of 3 GC-resistance ranging between 10 and 30 %. Negative predictive value was 99 % for E. coli and K. pneumoniae and 89 % for the species producing inducible <b>AmpC</b> <b>beta-lactamase.</b> In conclusion βLACTA™ test {{was found to be}} easy to use and efficient to predict resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, particularly in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains...|$|E
