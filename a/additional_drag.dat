5|$|The Raptor {{has three}} {{internal}} weapons bays: a large bay {{on the bottom}} of the fuselage, and two smaller bays on the sides of the fuselage, aft of the engine intakes. The main bay can accommodate six LAU-142/A launchers for beyond-visual-range missiles and each side bay has an LAU-141/A launcher for short-range missiles. Four of the launchers in the main bay can be replaced with two bomb racks that can each carry one 1,000lb (450kg) or four 250lb (110kg) bombs. Carrying armaments internally maintains the aircraft's stealth and minimizes <b>additional</b> <b>drag.</b> Missile launches require the bay doors to be open for less than a second, during which hydraulic arms push missiles clear of the aircraft; this is to reduce vulnerability to detection and to deploy missiles during high speed flight.|$|E

Furthermore, fuel consumption per seat is improved by 2% due to the rearranged cabin (Space-Flex and Smart-Lav) with increased seating, offering a 14% fuel burn reduction per seat for the new −900neo compared to the previous 235-tonne −300 version.

25|$|Historically, {{the focus}} of {{attention}} has been the severe impact due to biofouling on the speed of marine vessels. In some instances the hull structure and propulsion systems can become damaged. Over time, the accumulation of biofoulers on hulls increases both the hydrodynamic volume of a vessel and the frictional effects leading to increased drag of up to 60% The <b>additional</b> <b>drag</b> can decrease speeds up to 10%, which can require up to a 40% increase in fuel to compensate. With fuel typically comprising up to half of marine transport costs, biofouling methods are estimated to cost the shipping industry around $1 billion per year. Increased fuel use due to biofouling contributes to adverse environmental effects and is predicted to increase emissions of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide between 38 and 72 percent by 2020.|$|E

500|$|In March 2006, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) {{certified}} {{a modified}} control software enhancement to the Airbus A318 {{designed to allow}} the aircraft to perform steep approaches. The aircraft is the largest commercial aircraft certified by EASA for steep approach operations. The software modifies the control laws of the aircraft when the steep approach function is selected by the crew, by automatically deploying some of the spoiler panels to provide <b>additional</b> <b>drag</b> when the aircraft is in the landing configuration. It also provides alternative aural alerts to the crew and modifies spoiler deployment automatically below [...] on landing. The A318 steep approach procedure allows the aircraft to perform approaches at descent angles of up to 5.5°, {{as opposed to the}} standard 3° for a normal approach.|$|E
2500|$|Similar to the {{rotational}} effect mentioned above, {{the phenomena}} associated with flapping wings {{are not completely}} understood or agreed upon. Because every model is an approximation, different models leave out effects that are presumed to be negligible. For example, the Wagner effect says that circulation rises slowly to its steady-state due to viscosity when an inclined wing is accelerated from rest. This phenomenon would explain a lift value that is less than what is predicted. Typically, the case has been to find sources for the added lift. It {{has been argued that}} this effect is negligible for flow with a Reynolds number that is typical of insect flight. The Wagner effect was ignored, consciously, in at least one recent model. One of the most important phenomena that occurs during insect flight is leading edge suction. [...] This force is significant to the calculation of efficiency. The concept of leading edge suction first was put forth to describe vortex lift on sharp-edged delta wings. At high angles of attack, the flow separates over the leading edge, but reattaches before reaching the trailing edge. Within this bubble of separated flow is a vortex. Because the angle of attack is so high, a lot of momentum is transferred downward into the flow. These two features create a large amount of lift force as well as some <b>additional</b> <b>drag.</b> The important feature, however, is the lift. Because the flow has separated, yet it still provides large amounts of lift, this phenomenon is called stall delay. This effect was observed in flapping insect flight and it was proven to be capable of providing enough lift to account for the deficiency in the quasi-steady-state models. This effect is used by canoeists in a sculling draw stroke.|$|E

40|$|The {{blades of}} a {{vertical}} axis wind turbine (VAWT) rotor see an inconsistent {{angle of attack}} through its rotation. Consequently, VAWT blades generally use symmetrical aerofoils with a lower lift-to-drag ratio than cambered aerofoils tailored to maximise horizontal axis wind turbine rotor performance. This paper considers the feasibility of circulation controlled (CC) VAWT blades, using a tangential air jet to provide lift and therefore power augmentation. However CC blade sections require a higher trailing-edge thickness than conventional sections giving rise to <b>additional</b> base <b>drag.</b> The choice of design parameters is a compromise between lift augmentation, <b>additional</b> base <b>drag</b> as well as the power required to pump the air jet. Although CC technology has been investigated for many years, particularly for aerospace applications, few researchers have considered VAWT applications. This paper considers the feasibility of the technology, using Computational Fluid Dynamics to evaluate a baseline CC aerofoil with different trailing-edge ellipse shapes. Lift and drag increments due to CC are considered within a momentum based turbine model to determine net power production. The study found that for modest momentum coefficients significant net power augmentation can be achieved with a relatively simple aerofoil geometry if blowing is controlled through the blades rotation...|$|R
50|$|Lift-induced drag (also called induced drag) is drag {{which occurs}} {{as the result}} of the {{creation}} of lift on a three-dimensional lifting body, such as the wing or fuselage of an airplane. Induced drag consists of two primary components, including drag due to the creation of vortices (vortex drag) and the presence of <b>additional</b> viscous <b>drag</b> (lift-induced viscous drag). The vortices in the flow-field, present in the wake of a lifting body, derive from the turbulent mixing of air of varying pressure on the upper and lower surfaces of the body, which is a necessary condition for the creation of lift.|$|R

The contribution of inertia is included in the momentum transport equation through the quadratic Forchheimer correction term.

The natural convective flow field in this region is modified due to the <b>additional</b> inertial <b>drag.</b> This strongly influences the convective transport of solute and thereby incurs a modification of the dynamics of the advancement of the mushy zone.

Parametric studies were made to assess the effects of several shape variables on aerodynamic loads.

40|$|A {{high-speed}} {{wind tunnel}} test was conducted {{to determine the effect}} on cruise performance of installing long-duct refan-engine nacelles on the DC- 8 - 50 and - 61 models. Drag data and wing/pylon/nacelle channel pressure data are presented. At a typical cruise condition there exists a very small interference drag penalty of less than one-percent of total cruise data for the Refan installation. Pressure data indicate that some supersonic flow is present in the inboard channel of the inboard refan nacelle installation, but it is not sufficient to cause any wave drag on boundary layer separation. One pylon modification, which takes the form of pylon bumps, was tested. It resulted in a drag penalty, because its design goal of eliminating shock-related interference drag was not required and the bump thus became a source of <b>additional</b> parasite <b>drag...</b>|$|R
5000|$|We can {{identify}} many features on this patented design that {{spun out of}} the research work of famous researchers of that time such as Ludwig Prandtl, Wunibald Kamm, Theodore von Kármán etc. The streamlined, low drag body of the vehicle is equipped with an air inlet for the engine which is conveniently located at the maximum static pressure region at the [...] "nose". The body completely engulfs the wheels this eliminating their <b>additional</b> aerodynamic <b>drag.</b> The vehicle is equipped with 6 wheels (way before the Tyrrell P34 of the late 70s). The main reason for that design choice is the maximization of the contact area with {{the ground with a}} simultaneous reduction of the frontal area of the vehicle (i.e. low drag). At the same time the rear wheel axles could remain lower thus reducing the frontal area as well as the center of gravity of the vehicle.|$|R

In addition, a new transmitter track and pick-up geometry for 60 kHz operation are designed using finite element analysis (FEA). The proposed design is evaluated theoretically and experimentally. By using the simulated results, a new 180 kW, 15 m test-bed for a tram is constructed.

The bionic surface with micron-scale riblets formed spontaneously due to the elastic-plastic deformation of PVC in high temperature and high pressure environment. Comparative experiments between micro-structured bionic surface and smooth surface were performed in a wind tunnel to evaluate the effect of bionic surface on drag reduction, and significant drag reduction efficiency was obtained. Numerical simulation results show that microvortex induced in the solid-gas interface of bionic surface {{has the effect of}} shear stress reduction and the small level of an <b>additional</b> pressure <b>drag</b> resulting from pressure distribution deviation on bird feather like surface, hence reducing the skin friction drag significantly.
