Furthermore, he noted that South Korean support for the organization could increase tensions between the governments. A U.S. military analyst was unaware of any independent sources supporting the claims that the North Korean military would be discontent enough to attempt a coup.|$|E

Many behavior analysts have a doctorate. Most programs have a formalized internship program and several programs are offered online.

25|$|Not all <b>analysts</b> <b>are</b> entirely {{comfortable}} {{with this picture}} {{of the status of}} the English language in Quebec. For example, a more refined analysis of the Census data shows that a great deal of anglicization continues to occur in the communities traditionally associated with the English-language group, e.g., the Chinese, Italian, Greek and Indo-Pakistani groups. Nevertheless, a majority of new immigrants in every census since 1971 have chosen French more often than English as their adopted language. Statistics Canada's 2011 National Household Survey of Canada reported {{that for the first time}} in modern history, the first official language of more than half of Quebec immigrants was French. Those who spoke French as their first official language formed 51.1% of all immigrants to the province, while an additional 16.3% spoke both French and English; among those who immigrated to the province between 2006 and 2011, the proportion who spoke French as their first official language was 58.8%.|$|E

2500|$|Turnout reached nearly 80% by {{the time}} the polls closed, and the Bhutan Peace and Prosperity Party {{reportedly}} won 44 seats, with the People's Democratic Party winning only three seats (Phuentsholing in Chhukha, Goenkhatoe-Laya in Gasa and Sombeykha in Haa). The PDP's leader, Sangay Ngedup, who was also the ruling king's uncle, lost his own constituency by 380 votes. Reportedly, there were few differences between the platforms of the two parties, which might explain the unexpectedly uneven results; <b>analysts</b> <b>are</b> worried that the small representation of the opposition may obstruct the functioning of the newly founded democratic system.

2500|$|A further {{advancement}} which [...] "overcomes {{the limitations}} of sensitivity and scenario analyses by examining the effects of all possible combinations of variables and their realizations" [...] is to construct stochastic or probabilistic financial models – {{as opposed to the}} traditional static and deterministic models as above. For this purpose, the most common method is to use Monte Carlo simulation to analyze the project's NPV. This method was introduced to finance by David B. Hertz in 1964, although it has only recently become common: today <b>analysts</b> <b>are</b> even able to run simulations in spreadsheet based DCF models, typically using a risk-analysis add-in, such as @Risk or Crystal Ball. Here, the cash flow components that are (heavily) impacted by uncertainty are simulated, mathematically reflecting their [...] "random characteristics". In contrast to the scenario approach above, the simulation produces several thousand random but possible outcomes, or trials, [...] "covering all conceivable real world contingencies in proportion to their likelihood;" [...] see Monte Carlo Simulation versus [...] "What If" [...] Scenarios. The output is then a histogram of project NPV, and the average NPV of the potential investment – as well as its volatility and other sensitivities – is then observed. This histogram provides information not visible from the static DCF: for example, it allows for an estimate of the probability that a project has a net present value greater than zero (or any other value).|$|E

In May 2017, Kmart announced an additional 18 stores would close. Sears Holdings themselves revealed uncertainties as to if both Sears and Kmart will survive. [...] In early June 2017, Kmart announced an additional 49 stores across the U.S. were planned to be shuttered by September 2017. Financial <b>analysts</b> <b>are</b> now warning that the fate of Sears Holdings is nearing its end.

[...] In early July 2017, Kmart had {{announced that}} 35 more stores would close by early October 2017. In late August 2017, Kmart announced another 28 store closures. [...] The sole Rhode Island location in Cranston is among those 28 store closures, meaning that Kmart no longer exists in the state of Rhode Island. [...] On October 11, 2017, the Kmart store in Santa Rosa, California was apparently burnt down and destroyed due to massive wildfires in the Bay Area, adding to the list of closed stores. On October 17, 2017, Kmart announced closings of several locations by late November, but hasn't disclosed the exact amount of closing locations.|$|E
2500|$|One {{example of}} a blind {{analysis}} occurs in neutrino experiments, like the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, where the experimenters wish to report the total number N of neutrinos seen. The experimenters have preexisting expectations about what this number should be, and these expectations must {{not be allowed to}} bias the analysis. Therefore, the experimenters are allowed to see an unknown fraction f of the dataset. They use these data to understand the backgrounds, signal-detection efficiencies, detector resolutions, etc.. However, since no one knows the [...] "blinding fraction" [...] f, no one has preexisting expectations about the meaningless neutrino count N=N×f in the visible data; therefore, the analysis does not introduce any bias into the final number N which is reported. Another blinding scheme is used in B meson analyses in experiments like BaBar and CDF; here, the crucial experimental parameter is a correlation between certain particle energies and decay times—which require an extremely complex and painstaking analysis—and particle charge signs, which are fairly trivial to measure. <b>Analysts</b> <b>are</b> allowed to work with all the energy and decay data, but are forbidden from seeing the sign of the charge, and thus are unable to see the correlation (if any). At the end of the experiment, the correct charge signs are revealed; the analysis software is run once (with no subjective human intervention), and the resulting numbers are published. Searches for rare events, like electron neutrinos in MiniBooNE or proton decay in Super-Kamiokande, require a different class of blinding schemes.|$|E
