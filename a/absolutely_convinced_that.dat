25|$|Calvin Hoffman, {{author of}} The Man Who Was Shakespeare (1955), died in 1988, still <b>absolutely</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> Marlowe {{was the true}} author of Shakespeare's works. Anxious that the theory should not die with him, he left a {{substantial}} sum of money with the King's School, Canterbury—where Marlowe went as a boy—for them to administer an annual essay competition on this subject. The Trust Deed stipulated that the winning essay should be the one:...which {{in the opinion of}} the King's School most convincingly authoritatively and informatively examines and discusses in depth the life and works of Christopher Marlowe and the authorship of the plays and poems now commonly attributed to William Shakespeare with particular regard to the possibility that Christopher Marlowe wrote some or all of those poems and plays or made some inspirational creative or compositional contributions towards the authorship of them. (Emphasis added)The adjudication of the prize, which is of several thousand pounds (UK), has always been delegated to an eminent professional Shakespearian scholar and, despite Hoffman's clear intentions, the winning essay has seldom espoused the Marlovian cause, the prize having usually gone to essays along entirely orthodox lines.|$|E

Terk loves telling Tarzan what to do—that is, until Tarzan's physical strength proves he can hold {{her in a}} headlock instead. Even though Terk is very [...] bossy at times, Tarzan knows it's because she cares, though she will never say so willingly.|$|E

Then he remarked, [...] "It is really very serious, though." ...|$|R

In April 2014, conflict between the two has deepened and escalated to threats of imprisonment from both of them. President Traian Băsescu said that if Victor Ponta will try to interfere in the justice risks ending {{up in the hands}} of prosecutors, who will not tolerate that. He also stated that Ponta is deeply corrupt, and his election as president would be a great drama for Romania. In reply, Victor Ponta stated: „(...) I am <b>absolutely</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> Traian Băsescu will go to jail. I, who know that I have always respected the law, I have no fear”.|$|E
2500|$|Toole was in {{constant}} demand {{and went to}} all the parties where it was said [...] "he was encouraged and sometimes forced to perform, Ken would enter a room armed with quiver full of sharp stories and barbed one-liners. He would zing these out until his audience was weak with laughter, though he hadn't cracked a smile." [...] Because he was saving {{for a return to}} Columbia to get his Ph.D., Toole was a notorious skinflint during his year at USL. His friends noticed this and forced him to pay for and throw a party at his home. The party was a success and generally considered the best party thrown that year. In contrast to this image of an outgoing, lively young man, when Toole's mother came to visit, friends noticed that he became sullen and withdrawn. His friend Pat Rickels commented that Thelma [...] "was <b>absolutely</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> he was without flaw and that all the hopes of the world lay in him. It was an extreme form of maternalism, where all your pride and all your hopes are in one person. He had to grow up with that burden. She was a very ostentatious, shrill, loud-voiced, bossy, bragging woman." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 8 June 2011, Williams {{said that}} the British Government was {{committing}} Britain to [...] "radical, long-term policies for which no-one voted". Writing in the New Statesman magazine, Williams raised concerns about the coalition's health, education and welfare reforms. He said there was [...] "indignation" [...] {{due to a lack}} of [...] "proper public argument". He also {{said that the}} [...] "Big Society" [...] idea was viewed with [...] "widespread suspicion", noting also that [...] "we are still waiting for a full and robust account of what the Left would do differently and what a Left-inspired version of localism would look like". The article also said there was concern that the government would abandon its responsibility for tackling child poverty, illiteracy and poor access to the best schools. He also expressed concern about the [...] "quiet resurgence of the seductive language of 'deserving' and 'undeserving' poor" [...] and the steady pressure to increase [...] "what look like punitive responses to alleged abuses of the system". In response, David Cameron said that he “profoundly disagreed” with Williams's claim that the government was forcing through “radical policies for which no one voted”. Cameron said that the government was acting in a “good and moral” fashion and defended the “Big Society” and the Coalition’s deficit reduction, welfare and education plans. “I am <b>absolutely</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> our policies are about actually giving people a greater responsibility and greater chances in their life, and I will defend those very vigorously”, he said. “By all means let us have a robust debate but I can tell you, it will always be a two-sided debate.” ...|$|E
50|$|As far as I'm concerned, {{this was}} the turning point {{of the civil rights}} movement. I'm <b>absolutely</b> <b>convinced</b> of <b>that.</b> Until then, despite every setback and {{disappointment}} and obstacle we had faced over the years, the belief still prevailed that the system would work, the system would listen, the system would respond. Now, for the first time, we had made our way to {{the very center of the}} system. We had played by the rules, done everything we were supposed to do, had played the game exactly as required, had arrived at the doorstep and found the door slammed in our face.|$|R

40|$|When {{revising}} the genus Siphia and allied genera in the Leyden Museum, I fell upon {{the fact that}} our typical males and female of Stoparola concreta (Müller) from the Highlands of Padang (Sumatra) are in striking contrast with the other species of the genus Stoparola, which on the whole is characterized by the sea-green general color, the triangular, flat shape of the bill, the short tarsi and the uniformity in color between male and female. Their strong resemblance with Siphia Everetti, which I brought home from Borneo, led me to the comparison with the description of Siphia cyanea from the mountains of Tenasserim and Perak, a very rare bird which is not represented in the Leyden Museum. This comparison <b>absolutely</b> <b>convinced</b> me <b>that</b> our Sumatran birds are identical with S. cyanea from Tenasserim and Perak. Muscicapa concreta having the priority, the species has to stand in future under the name of Siphia concreta (Müller), the synonymy of which will be as follows...|$|R
6000|$|This, of course, started Mr. Fyshe on his {{favourite}} topic. [...] "Luxury!" [...] he exclaimed, [...] "I {{should think}} so! It is {{the curse of}} the age. The appalling growth of luxury, the piling up of money, the ease with which huge fortunes are made" [...] (Good! thought the Duke, here we are coming to it), [...] "these are the {{things that are going to}} ruin us. Mark my words, the whole thing is bound to end in a tremendous crash. I don't mind telling you, Duke-my friends here, I am sure, know it already--that I am more or less a revolutionary socialist. I am <b>absolutely</b> <b>convinced,</b> sir, <b>that</b> our modern civilization will end in a great social catastrophe.

60|$|And {{right here}} was John Barleycorn getting me {{in a more}} {{insidious}} though no less deadly way than when he nearly sent me out with the tide. I had a few months still to run before I was seventeen; I scorned {{the thought of a}} steady job at anything; I felt myself a pretty tough individual in a group of pretty tough men; and I drank because these men drank and because I had to make good with them. I had never had a real boyhood, and in this, my precocious manhood, I was very hard and woefully wise. Though I had never known girl's love even, I had crawled through such depths <b>that</b> I was <b>convinced</b> <b>absolutely</b> <b>that</b> I knew the last word about love and life. And it wasn't a pretty knowledge. Without being pessimistic, I was quite satisfied that life was a rather cheap and ordinary affair.|$|R

6000|$|The next news I had {{of him was}} in his essay, [...] "Ordered South," [...] {{concerning}} the emotions, apathies, and pleasures, on that then fairy coast, {{of a young man}} who thinks that his days are numbered. After reading this paper, I was <b>absolutely</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that,</b> among the writers of our generation, Stevenson was first, like Eclipse, and the rest nowhere. There was nobody to be spoken of in his company as a writer. It was not his style alone--Pater's style had bewitched me in his first book--but it was the life that underlay the style of Stevenson.|$|E
60|$|Two {{days later}} they were driving in the Row. It was Hilda's first {{appearance}} there since the General's death, and, after talking it over with Netta, she now appeared there {{in order to show}} that she was perfectly convinced that the child which had been found in the canal was not her little cousin. The details of the proceedings of the coroner's court had, of course, been read by all her friends, and her appearance in the park would be the best proof that she could give that the family were <b>absolutely</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> the body was not that of Walter.|$|E

For {{the first time since}} he could remember, a little cloud had loomed over his few short hours with Pauline. She had resented some contemptuous speech of his, and as though to mark her sense of his lack of generosity, she had {{encouraged}} Saton to talk, encouraged him to talk until the other conversation had died away, and the whole room had listened to this exponent of what he declared to be a new science. The fellow was a poseur and an impostor, Rochester told himself vigorously. He knew, he was <b>absolutely</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> he was not honest.|$|E
