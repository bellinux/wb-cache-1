The anterior chamber depth (- 1. 5 ± 0. 3 D) and both crystalline lens surfaces (front 3. 1 ± 0. 8 D; rear 2. 1 ± 0. 6 D) contributed to dioptric vergence changes that accompany accommodation. Accommodation did not alter ocular surface alignment. Ocular misalignment in relaxed eyes is mainly because of eye rotation (5. 7 ± 1. 6 ° temporally) with small amounts of lens tilt (0. 2 ± 0. 8 ° temporally) and decentration (0. 1 ± 0. 1 mm nasally) but these results must be viewed with caution as we did not account for corneal asymmetry. Comparison of calculated and empirically derived coefficients (upon which ocular surface alignment calculations depend) revealed that negligible inherent errors arose from neglect of ocular surface asphericity, lens gradient refractive index properties, surface astigmatism, effects of pupil size and centration, assumed eye rotation axis position and use of linear equations for analysing Purkinje image shifts. © 2004 The College of Optometrists...|$|E
40|$|A {{study using}} {{multiple}} techniques provided insight into tectonic influences on ground water systems; the re-sults {{can help to}} understand ground water systems in the tectonically active western United States {{and other parts of}} the world. Ground water in the San Bernardino Valley (Arizona, United States and Sonora, Mexico) is the main source of water for domestic use, cattle ranching (the primary industry), and the preservation of threatened and endangered species. To improve the understanding of ground water occurrence, movement, and sustainability, an investigation was conducted using a number of complementary methods, including major ion geochemistry, iso-tope hydrology, analysis of gases dissolved in ground water, aquifer testing, geophysics, and an examination of surface and subsurface geology. By combining information from multiple lines of investigation, a more complete picture of the basin hydrogeology was assembled than would have been possible using fewer methods. The results show that the hydrogeology of the San Bernardino Valley is markedly different than that of its four neighboring basins in the United States. The differences include water quality, chemical evolution, storage, and residence time. The differences result from the locally unique geology of the San Bernardino Valley, which is due to the presence of a magmatically <b>active</b> <b>accommodation</b> zone (a zone separating two regions of normal faults with opposite dips). The geological differences and the resultant hydrological differences between the San Bernardino Valley and its neighboring basins may serve as a model for the distinctive nature of chemical evolution of ground water in other basins with locally distinct tectonic histories...|$|E

40|$|Reading {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} activities in most people’s life. For children, reading is a window to knowledge, good educational achievement and better job opportunities in the future. Thus reading fluency is a very important factor in the child’s education. Children and young adults with low vision usually use a close working distance to gain relative distance magnification. Unlike adults, they have <b>active</b> <b>accommodation.</b> Many studies, however, have shown that children and young adults with low vision have reduced accommodation response compared to the norms of their age. Reading additions (high plus lenses) can correct for this reduction in accommodation and may be an optimum method of prescribing magnification in younger adults with low vision. There have been no studies to verify the best method of prescribing reading additions in young adults with low vision and few studies of their effect on reading performance. 	This is the first study to compare different methods to determine reading additions and their effect on reading performance in young adults with low vision. The aims of the present study are 1) to investigate if three different methods to determine reading additions would lead to significantly different dioptric powers 2) to determine which method (if any) would lead to better reading performance. Reading performance was assessed by measuring the maximum reading speed, critical print size (CPS), print size threshold and the area under the reading speed curve. 	This was an experimental study involving thirty participants with low vision aged between 8 to 35 years. Participants were recruited from the Low Vision Clinic at the School of Optometry, University of Waterloo, Canadian National Institute for the Blind (CNIB) and the Vision Institute of Canada. All participants underwent a routine clinical examination including distance visual acuity, near visual acuity, Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity, unilateral cover test, static retinoscopy, subjective refraction and measurement of the habitual reading distance. A questionnaire was used to determine their usage of any low vision aids, their perceived difficulty with reading and time spent reading. Reading additions were determined by 1) an objective method using Nott dynamic retinoscopy 2) an age-based formula 3) a subjective method based on the participant’s response to lenses. Reading tasks and dynamic retinoscopy were conducted at a fixed working distance of 12. 5 cm. Reading performance was assessed using MNREAD-style reading charts with each of the reading additions and without a reading addition, in a random order. Sentences were arranged in way that no sentence was repeated by the same participant. Participants were timed with a stop watch in order to calculate the reading speed in correct words per minute (CWPM). Reading speeds were plotted against print size to calculate the maximum reading speed, the critical print size, MNREAD threshold and the area under the reading speed curve. 	The participant’s mean age was 16 (± 6) years. There were equal number of males and females. The mean distance visual acuity of the tested eye ranged from 0. 357 to 1. 184 logMAR with a mean of 0. 797 ± 0. 220 logMAR. The near visual acuity ranged between 0. 301 to 1. 301 logMAR with a mean of 0. 80 ± 0. 26 logMAR. There were six participants who already had a reading addition. Maximum reading speed ranged between 52 to 257 wpm (165 ± 61 wpm). Critical print size ranged between 0. 325 to 1. 403 logMAR (0. 965 ± 0. 279 logMAR). 	Repeated measures ANOVA on the whole group showed that there was a significant difference between the reading additions (p= 0. 001). The retinoscopy reading addition power was significantly lower than the age add (p= 0. 002) and the subjective add (p= 0. 038). Repeated measures ANOVA did not show any improvement of any of the reading measures with the reading additions compared to without the reading addition. A re-analysis was undertaken excluding participants who had normal accommodation at 12. 5 cm. The results of repeated measures ANOVA showed that there was no significant difference in the dioptric powers obtained by the three methods, although, all reading addition power were significantly greater than zero (t-test < 0. 0005). There was a significant difference in the area under the reading speed curve (p= 0. 035), which was greater with the subjective addition than with no reading addition (p= 0. 048). The MNREAD threshold significantly improved with the age addition compared to no addition (p= 0. 012). There was a large variability between the participants in their response to a reading addition. Analysis of individual data showed that some participants showed a clear improvement in reading performance with a reading addition. Other participants did not demonstrate any obvious improvement in reading performance with reading additions. Of those participants who showed an improvement, all but one participant had abnormal accommodation. However, not all participants who did not show an improvement had normal accommodation. 	Univariate analysis and forward step-wise linear regression analysis were used to investigate if any improvement in reading performance and the habitual reading performance without a reading addition could be predicted by factors that were measured in the study. These factors included distance visual acuity, near visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, lag of accommodation, age, time spent on reading each day, perceived difficulty of reading regular print and whether or not the participant received training for the usage of his/her low vision aids. Improvement in reading performance could not be predicted by any of these factors. Habitual reading performance without a reading addition was correlated with some factors. Univariate analysis showed that critical print size was associated with MNREAD threshold (r= 0. 904. p< 0. 0005), distance visual acuity (r= 0. 681, p< 0. 0005) and contrast sensitivity (r=- 0. 428, p= 0. 018) and MNREAD threshold without an addition was associated with the contrast sensitivity (r=- 0. 431, p= 0. 017,) and distance visual acuity (r= 0. 728, p< 0. 0005). Difficulty of reading correlated with near visual acuity (Spearman correlation coefficient= 0. 620, p= 0. 0009), MNREAD threshold (Spearman correlation coefficient= 0. 450, p= 0. 02) and maximum reading speed (Spearman correlation coefficient=- 0. 472, p= 0. 014). Time spent on reading each day correlated with the area under the reading speed curve (Spearman correlation coefficient= 0. 659, p= 0. 0024). The multiple regression analysis showed that MNREAD threshold was best predicted by distance visual acuity (R= 0. 728, p < 0. 0005), critical print size could be predicted by distance visual acuity (R= 0. 681, p < 0. 0005) and age (R= 0. 748, p= 0. 022) and the power of the subjective addition could be predicted by age (R= 0. 583, p= 0. 001) and near visual acuity (R= 0. 680, p= 0. 028). 	There was evidence that a reading addition improved reading performance as measured by the area under the curve and MNREAD (reading acuity) thresholds, but this was not predicted by any visual factor, except that all those who gained improvement had poor accommodation. Therefore, it is recommended that an eye care practitioner should demonstrate a reading addition in a low vision assessment of children and young adults, particularly with patients who have reduced accommodation...|$|E

40|$|We present new {{analogue}} modelling {{results of}} crustal thrust-systems {{in which a}} deformable (brittle) hanging wall is assumed to endure passive internal deformation during thrusting, i. e. exclusively {{as a consequence of}} having to adapt its shape to the variable geometry of a rigid footwall. Building on previous experimental contributions, we specifically investigate the role of two so far overlooked critical variables: a) concave-convex (CC) vs. flat-ramp-flat (FRF) thrust ramp geometry; and b) presence vs. absence of a basal velocity discontinuity (VD). Regarding the first variable, we compare new results for considered (CC) smoother ramp types against classical experiments in which (FRF) sharp ramp geometries are always prescribed. Our results show that the considered sharp vs. smooth variation in the thrust-ramp geometry produces important differences in the distribution of the local stress field in the deformable hanging wall above both (lower and upper) fault bends, with corresponding styles of strain accommodation being expressed by marked differences in measured morpho-structural parameters. Regarding the second variable, we for the first time report analogue modelling results of this type of experiments in which basal VDs are experimentally prescribed to be absent. Our results critically show that true passive hanging wall deformation is only possible to simulate {{in the absence of any}} basal VD, since <b>active</b> shortening <b>accommodation</b> always necessarily occurs in the hanging wall above such a discontinuity (i. e. above the lower fault bend). In addition, we show that the morpho-structural configuration of model thrust-wedges formed for prescribed VD absence conditions complies well with natural examples of major overthrusts, wherein conditions must occur that approximate a frictionless state along the main basal thrust-plane...|$|R
40|$|Three {{prominent}} incised-valley fills of post-Last Glacial Maximum age {{are described}} {{from the northern}} Tuscan coast of Italy. Stratigraphic correlation of core data along a cross-section transversal to the present fluvial-channel axes enables identification of a suite of genetically related valley bodies that fill the incisions made up by Arno, Serchio and Camaiore-Stiava rivers during the last glacial/interglacial cycle. The valley fills display different shapes and size, but remarkably similar facies architecture. Valley bodies range between 5 and 10 km in width, and between 30 and 45 m in thickness, with width/thickness ratios of about 100 - 300. Above a lowstand (and early transgressive?) gravel fluvial deposit, the three incised-valley fills display a distinctive succession of coastal plain to estuarine facies, dated to about 13 - 8 cal ka BP. Radiocarbon dates document that the three valleys were <b>active</b> simultaneously. <b>Accommodation</b> space was rapidly created during transgression and then filled under conditions of very high sediment accumulation (about 1 cm/y). In contrast to the more common deepening-upward trend recorded by the latest Pleistocene-early Holocene valley-fill successions worldwide, sedimentation in the Tuscan valleys equalled, or even exceeded, {{the rate at which}} accommodation was created, thus leading to an aggradational, rather than backstepping, stacking pattern of high-frequency (millennial-scale) parasequences. Above the valley fills and on the interfluves, a thin deepening-upward succession of nearshore deposits marks the rapid change from aggradational to retrogradational depositional style. This is invariably overlain by a characteristic shallowing-upward motif of prograding deltaic and coastal facies. The maximum flooding surface, which can be tracked across the whole study area on the basis of subtle palaeontologic indicators, is shown to represent an almost isochronous surface, dated to about 7. 8 cal ka BP. Through examination of large-scale geometry and facies attributes of the valley fills, including the relationships between valley bodies and interfluves, this study represents an example of how adjacent river systems with significantly different characteristics may respond simultaneously in a consistent manner to rapid changes in sea-level and climate conditions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA...|$|R
40|$|Pleiotropy is a {{key feature}} of the genotype-phenotype map, and its form and extent have many {{evolutionary}} implications, including for the dynamics of adaptation {{and the evolution of}} specialization. Similarly, pleiotropic effects of antibiotic resistance mutations may affect the evolution of antibiotic resistance in the simultaneous or fluctuating presence of different antibiotics. Here, we study the role of pleiotropy during the in vitro adaptation of the enzyme TEM- 1 β-lactamase to two novel antibiotics, cefotaxime (CTX) and ceftazidime (CAZ). We subject replicate lines for four rounds of evolution to selection with CTX and CAZ alone, and in their combined and fluctuating presence. Evolved alleles show positive correlated responses when selecting with single antibiotics. Nevertheless, pleiotropic constraints are apparent from the effects of single mutations and from selected alleles showing smaller correlated than direct responses and smaller responses after simultaneous and fluctuating selection with both than with single antibiotics. We speculate that these constraints result from structural changes in the oxyanion pocket surrounding the <b>active</b> site, where <b>accommodation</b> of CTX and the larger CAZ is balanced against their positioning with respect to the active site. Our findings suggest limited benefits from the combined or fluctuating application of these related cephalosporins for containing antibiotic resistance. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Refractive error (an {{imperfection}} of ocular image formation) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common reasons that patients seek out optometrists. Uncompensated refractive error, which is related to second order wavefront aberrations, causes unwanted blurring of retinal images. Distance refractive error can be affected by the presence of <b>active</b> ocular <b>accommodation.</b> Young patients, in particular, have very active accommodative systems and when active during the measurement of refractive error, can lead to erroneous results. Accommodation theoretically should only be active when a patient regards a proximal or near object; however this is not always the case and therefore pharmaceuticals (cycloplegics) have been employed by ophthalmologists and optometrists to temporarily paralyze the accommodative system in order for refractive error to be evaluated at any distance more accurately. The primary aim of this study is to use multivariate methods of analysis to evaluate and study the changes in refractive error occurring at distance (a stimulated six metre target) and at near (40 centimetres), as well as exploring the effects of accommodation and cycloplegia on the measured refractive errors. The instruments used included the NIDEK ARK- 700 autorefractor and the NIDEK OPD-Scan ARK 10000 wavefront aberrometer. Ten subjects were recruited for this particular study and eight samples were taken per individual under four different experimental conditions (four samples per instrument per subject). These samples were so named; the Distance Samples Without Cycloplegia, the Distance Samples With Cycloplegia, the Near Samples Without Cycloplegia, and the Near Samples With Cycloplegia and are referred to as such throughout his dissertation. These samples were collected with both the autorefractor and the wavefront aberrometer mentioned above and converted, using matrix methods, into scalar coefficients of power and therefore the stigmatic and antistigmatic components are represented as FI (the stigmatic coefficient), FJ (the ortho-antistigmatic coefficient) and FK (the oblique-antistigmatic coefficient). The sample size for each experimental condition was 25 measurements. The samples without cycloplegia were obtained first on both the autorefractor and wavefront aberrometer, and once these samples had been collected, one drop of 1 % cyclopentolate hydrochloride was added to each of the subject’s right eyes and once the accommodative system was seemingly paralyzed the distance and near samples under the influence of cycloplegia were taken once again with each instrument [...] .
