25|$|Around 2000 in John Jay High School, Deidra DiMaso {{was troubled}} {{when she read}} Bless Me, Ultima to her two daughters. She was {{prompted}} to challenge the book’s placement in the high school's ninth grade curriculum. She addressed officials within the school and district alongside directly speaking in <b>a</b> <b>school</b> <b>board</b> meeting in November of that year. Her reasoning was that the book “is full of sex and cursing”; she later expanded on her policy by saying “I asked the board members to please review all the books for any sexual content, violence, or foul language prior to any book becoming required reading.”. The secondary source of this story, Banned in the U.S.A.: A Reference Guide to Book Censorship in Schools and Public Libraries, tells that the superintendent, Wayne Gersen, followed the standard protocol for addressing challenged materials but doesn’t specify {{the conclusion of the}} case.|$|E
25|$|Many of Steinbeck's {{works are}} {{required}} reading in American high schools. In the United Kingdom, Of Mice and Men {{is one of}} the key texts used by the examining body AQA for its English Literature GCSE. A study by the Center for the Learning and Teaching of Literature in the United States found that Of Mice and Men was one of the ten most frequently read books in public high schools. Contra-wise, Steinbeck's works have been frequently banned in the United States. The Grapes of Wrath was banned by school boards: in August 1939, Kern County Board of Supervisors banned the book from the county's publicly funded schools and libraries. It was burned in Salinas on two different occasions. In 2003, <b>a</b> <b>school</b> <b>board</b> in Mississippi banned it on the grounds of profanity. According to the American Library Association Steinbeck was one of the ten most frequently banned authors from 1990 to 2004, with Of Mice and Men ranking sixth out of 100 such books in the United States.|$|E

Gregg Henry and Charlotte Ross appeared as Quinn's parents, Russell and Judy Fabray, and Molly Shannon played Brenda Castle, an alcoholic astronomy teacher and badminton coach who clashed with Sue. Neil Patrick Harris guest starred as Bryan Ryan, Will's former glee club rival, now <b>a</b> <b>school</b> <b>board</b> member bent on vengeance against the club.

500|$|Vonnegut's {{works have}} evoked ire on several occasions. His most {{prominent}} novel, Slaughterhouse-Five, has been objected to or removed at various institutions {{in at least}} 18 instances. In the case of Island Trees School District v. Pico, the United States Supreme Court ruled that a school district's ban on Slaughterhouse-Five—which the board had called [...] "anti-American, anti-Christian, anti-Semitic, and just plain filthy"—and eight other novels was unconstitutional. When <b>a</b> <b>school</b> <b>board</b> in Republic, Missouri decided to withdraw Vonnegut's novel from its libraries, the Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library offered a free copy to all the students of the district.|$|E

It was directed by Joss Whedon and written by series creator Brad Falchuk. Neil Patrick Harris guest-stars as former glee club star Bryan Ryan. Working as <b>a</b> <b>school</b> <b>board</b> auditor, he threatens to cut the glee club out of the budget, bitter at never having attained his own show-business dreams. Rachel (Lea Michele) attempts to find her birth mother, and Artie (Kevin McHale) struggles with his desire to walk. The episode title is a reference to Aerosmith's song [...] "Dream On", also performed during the episode.|$|E
500|$|Community members {{often become}} {{involved}} in the debate over banning fighting. In December 2006, <b>a</b> <b>school</b> <b>board</b> trustee in London, Ontario attended a London Knights game and was shocked by the fighting and by the crowd's positive reaction to it. [...] This experience led him to organize an ongoing effort to ban fighting in the Ontario Hockey League, where the Knights compete, by attempting to gain the support of other school boards and by writing letters to OHL administrators. On the advice of its Medical Health Officer, the Middlesex-London Health board has supported recommendations to ban fighting across amateur hockey and to increase disciplinary measures to ensure deterrence.|$|E

500|$|Roswell High School {{first opened}} in 1949, {{and is the}} second oldest high school in Fulton County north of the Chattahoochee River. Like the city of Roswell, the school bears the name of Roswell King. [...] King founded the cotton mill that would {{eventually}} be the city's economic backbone for much of its early history. The immediate predecessor to Roswell High School was the Roswell Public School on Mimosa Boulevard, which housed grades 1–10 and opened in the 1892 after the Georgia General Assembly passed Act No. 51 on December 20, 1892, allowing the city to elect <b>a</b> <b>school</b> <b>board</b> and levy taxes for support of the school. Students from outside the city limits were required to pay tuition. In 1896, the city council and mayor were authorized {{by the state to}} issue $5,000 in bonds to build a new school building.|$|E
500|$|Along with {{a couple}} {{prominent}} Edmonton citizens, he formed an association aimed to restore order in the area, settling many disputes, including during the 1885 Riel Rebellion as its captain. He soon established <b>a</b> <b>school</b> <b>board,</b> recognizing {{the need for a}} school, which he served as president and trustee for 18 years. [...] Shortly before Edmonton was incorporated as a town in 1892, he formed the Board of Trade. Upon the incorporation, he was acclaimed the town's first mayor in 1892, and the next two following years. He did not run for re-election {{at the end of his}} third term, opting to run for the seat representing Edmonton on the Territorial Legislature, which he served for six years. Following his defeat moved to Tofield, Alberta farm until 1905, when he returned to Edmonton and was elected to the new Legislative Assembly of Alberta. The following year, he resigned his seat to serve as the first warden of the province's first penitentiary. After five years as warden, he moved to British Columbia to fruit farm, but he moved back to Sexsmith, Alberta 13 years later to farm, where he died in 1930.|$|E
500|$|Stanley {{suffered}} a significant setback in the House Appropriations Committee on September 14, when supporters {{of a local}} option won a narrow vote to amend the Stanley plan to permit local districts to integrate. The amended plan was reported to the House floor. Stanley immediately proposed yet another new plan which automatically cut off funds to any or all portions of a school district which integrated. Under the new Stanley plan, however, <b>a</b> <b>school</b> <b>board</b> could petition to have the schools reopened, although this would require that the Assembly take over the district, the governor to act as the Assembly's agent, and the governor to implement a segregationist pupil assignment plan. The governor's opponents, however, countered with their own plan in which each school board would retain {{the right to make}} pupil assignments (although pupil assignments could now be appealed a three-member [...] "pupil assignment board"). Any parents with children in a school could challenge the assignment of a child to that school. Appeals would be required to go through the state court system after leaving the pupil assignment board; in the meantime, the child would remain at their original school (a process intended to delay the assignment of a black student to an all-white school). To ensure that the plan was a [...] "local option," [...] both the school board and the local pupil assignment board would need to adopt a pupil assignment plan, or state funds would be cut off. A cut-off could be avoided if 10 percent of the school district's voters signed a petition calling for a referendum, and voters approved implementation of a pupil assignment plan (a process intended to allow voters to bypass an integrationist school board). Local communities were also permitted to drop the pupil assignment plan if 25 percent of school district voters signed a petition calling for a referendum on the issue and voters approved the referendum.|$|E
