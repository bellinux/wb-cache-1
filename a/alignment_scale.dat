40|$|The {{alignment}} of galaxies is considered using circular statistics to model random tidal torques. It is shown that an initial alignment is not greatly dispersed by subsequent torques and should remain detectable even with quite small samples. It is {{shown that the}} dispersion {{can be used to}} estimate the amount of random torque experienced since the initial alignment was imposed and hence to estimate the age of the alignment and so of the galaxies themselves. It is suggested that the ambiguity of the existing data may result either from the investigation of clusters and superclusters larger than the typical <b>alignment</b> <b>scale</b> (in the mistaken belief that such large samples are needed to achieve statistical significance), or from the galaxies being older than is generally supposed.

40|$|The present paper can {{be viewed}} as an {{extension}} of the theory of differential argument encoding developed in Aissen (1999; 2003). We maintain Aissen’s hypothesis that the effects of differential argument encoding can be derived from harmonic <b>alignment</b> of <b>scales,</b> but we argue that differential encoding should best be viewed as a purely morphological phenomenon (rather than as a syntactic phenomenon, as in Aissen’s approach). More specifically, we suggest that harmonic <b>alignment</b> of <b>scales</b> may bring about impoverishment operations that reduce syntactic inputs for morphological realization (see Halle & Marantz (1993)). The evidence for this new approach comes from the observation that the yes/no alternations of case exponents as they are envisaged in Aissen’s system are insufficient to account for degrees of morphological marking. As we will show based on data from a variety of languages (among them Hindi, Dyirbal, Kambera, Mannheim German, and Finnish), the zero/non-zero alternations discussed by Aissen are only part of a much broader less/more pattern...|$|R

A large <b>scale</b> <b>alignment</b> of optical polarizations from distant QSOs has recently been observed by Hutsemékers and collaborators.

The results of these statistical procedures continue to support the existence of the large <b>scale</b> <b>alignment</b> effect in the QSO optical polarization data. The alignment is found to be much more pronounced in the data sample with low degrees of polarization p ≤ 2 %. This suggests that the alignment may be attributed to some propagation effect. The distance scale over which the alignment effect is dominant is found to be of order 1 Gpc. We also find that a very large <b>scale</b> <b>alignment</b> is present in the large redshift, z ≥ 1, data sample.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Among {{the most}} robust generalizations in {{syntactic}} markedness is the as-sociation of semantic role with person/animacy rank, discussed first in Silverstein (1976). The present paper explores how Silverstein’s generalization might {{be expressed in}} a formal theory of grammar, {{and how it can}} play a role in individual grammars. The account, which focuses here on the role of person, is developed in Optimality Theory. Central to it are two formal devices which have been proposed in connection with phonology: harmonic <b>alignment</b> of prominence <b>scales,</b> and local conjunction of constraints. It is shown that application of harmonic <b>alignment</b> to <b>scales</b> involving syntactic relations and several substantive dimensions characterizes the universal markedness relations operative in this domain, and provides the constraints necessary for grammar construction. Differences between languages can be described as differences in the ranking of universal constraints. Among the most robust generalizations in syntactic markedness is the association of semantic role with person/animacy rank, discussed first in Michael Silverstein’s (1976) paper, ‘Hierarchy of Features and Ergativity’...|$|R

Blood plasma was collected from 43 gefitinib-treated NSCLC patients developing acute ILD (confirmed by blinded diagnostic review) and 123 randomly selected controls in a nested case-control study within a pharmacoepidemiological cohort study in Japan.

Multivariate peptide, protein, and pathway modeling achieved ILD prediction comparable to previously identified clinical variables; combining the two provided some improvement. The acute phase response pathway was strongly represented (17 of 29 proteins, p =  1. 0 × 10 − 25), suggesting a key role with potential utility as a marker for increased risk of acute ILD events.
