5|$|In May 1945, all German {{troops in}} Norway {{came under the}} command of the Twentieth Mountain Army, which had absorbed the Army Norway on 18 December 1944. It was {{commanded}} by General Franz Böhme, who had succeeded General Lothar Rendulic as Armed Forces Commander, Norway in January 1945. At the beginning of May, Böhme informed Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz, Commander-in-Chief of the Naval High Command and the new German president, with the death of Adolf Hitler, that all forces in Norway consisted of eleven divisions and five brigades. In total, they had a combined strength of between 350,000 and 380,000 troops. There were also a number of U-boats stationed in naval bases in Norway, including 10 Mark XXI and 17 Mark XXIII models. Yet although Allied forces had entered Germany, and rumours and speculation were rife about a possible invasion of Norway, the Twentieth Mountain Army <b>almost</b> <b>seemed</b> to be at a peace-time status; Böhme had complained in January that there were some units in the Army that took Sunday off as a holiday, and that he could do little to stop it.|$|E
25|$|In early 2011, Vinnie Paz {{announced}} on his Facebook page that In Death Reborn {{is due to}} be released in 2012, however the date was pushed back and <b>almost</b> <b>seemed</b> like it {{was never going to be}} released. Early in 2012, Houston underground MC Zilla and Connecticut's Blacastan were added to the group. Both artists have made names for themselves with their features and album releases in 2012. In Death Reborn was eventually released on April 22, 2014. The album featured members Vinnie Paz, Apathy, Blacastan, Block McCloud, Celph Titled, Demoz, Des Devious, Doap Nixon, Esoteric, Lawrence Arnell, King Magnetic, King Syze, OuterSpace, Reef the Lost Cauze and Zilla. Their fifth studio album, Heavy Lies the Crown was released on October 21, 2014.|$|E
500|$|More heated letters {{passed between}} Andrew and Stone, and then Andrew {{involved}} Sumner, who quickly and strongly denounced Stone to the U.S. Senate. Stone's written response to thisdescribed as [...] "in terms so bitter that it <b>almost</b> <b>seemed</b> {{as if he}} were challenging the senator to duel"further inflamed the situation. Stone's dealings with these two men would have tragic consequences in his near future.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} {{considered}} a box office bomb in the US but generally achieved greater success both critically and commercially in Europe. Many observers found similarities with Independence Day, which also came out in 1996. [...] "It was just a coincidence. Nobody told me about it. I was surprised how close it was," [...] director Tim Burton continued, [...] "but then it's a pretty basic genre I guess. Independence Day was different in tone – it was different in everything. It <b>almost</b> <b>seemed</b> like we had done kind of a Mad magazine version of Independence Day." [...] During the film's theatrical run in January 1997, TBS purchased the broadcasting rights of the film.|$|E
500|$|Thompson {{felt that}} the {{inclusion}} of slavery as a key theme led to this book being [...] "one of Hergé's more adult-oriented adventures". Nevertheless, Farr noted that the story contained [...] "a good measure of humour" [...] to balance out these darker elements. Farr drew comparisons with Anthony Powell's A Dance to the Music of Time, a series of novels that was contemporary to The Red Sea Sharks and which was similarly inspired by Balzac's The Human Comedy. Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline believed that The Red Sea Sharks represented [...] "the culmination of his golden age", which had begun with The Blue Lotus. He also commented that [...] "it <b>almost</b> <b>seemed</b> as if Hergé had regained the pace and rhythm of his most creative period" [...] with this story.|$|E
500|$|Regarding Johnny Blaze, Schwartz {{said that}} [...] "Marvel TV is {{introducing}} {{the idea of}} multiple Ghost Riders into its mythology, which {{sets the stage for}} Robbie Reyes not being the only one possessed by the Spirit of Vengeance in this world. That's more than we could have hoped for Agents of SHIELDs take on the iconic Marvel hero." [...] She [...] speculated that a spin-off featuring Blaze and/or Reyes was now a realistic possibility. Buxton said that [...] "Marvel just established a much bigger Ghost Rider mythos that can be explored on TV, in movies, or Netflix and that is really damn exciting." [...] Valentine felt the appearance was a [...] "pretty amazing development", and stated, [...] "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. <b>almost</b> <b>seemed</b> hamstrung by its connections to the Marvel Universe, seemingly unable to make a move without first consulting what precisely was happening in the movie universe. [...] we’re shown what Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. could have been all along: a sister piece that plays to the outer elements of the MCU that the movies haven’t been able to touch." ...|$|E

500|$|Verity never {{spun the}} ball very far, {{particularly}} after his second tour to Australia, and preferred {{to concentrate on}} bowling a good length. However, critics {{did not think that}} Verity posed enough of a threat to batsmen and could be dull to watch. By the middle of his career, he had a reputation for being ineffective on good batting pitches, and was occasionally dropped from the England team for his lack of effectiveness. Even so, he only missed one Test against Australia and one against South Africa, the two strongest Test playing teams, after he made his debut. Verity believed his performances in unfavourable conditions for his bowling had greater merit than his successes in favourable ones. He once said: [...] "Do not praise me when I have taken 8 for 20 on a sticky wicket, but when I have got 2 for 100 on a perfect wicket." [...] At times, Verity <b>almost</b> <b>seemed</b> bored when bowling and performed less effectively, particularly if his side were winning without needing his contribution. Bowes once told the Yorkshire captain, Brian Sellers, that the way to get the best out of Verity was to tell him that everything depended on him.|$|E
2500|$|The Romantic {{movement}} in art, literature, and theatre was {{a reaction against}} formal constraints and the mechanics of industrialization. The zeitgeist led choreographers to compose romantic ballets that appeared light, airy and free that would act as a contrast {{to the spread of}} reductionist science through many aspects of daily life that had, in the words of Poe, [...] "driven the hamadryad from the woods". These [...] "unreal" [...] ballets portrayed women as fragile unearthly beings, ethereal creatures who could be lifted effortlessly and <b>almost</b> <b>seemed</b> to float in the air. Ballerinas began to wear costumes with pastel, flowing skirts that bared the shins. The stories revolved around uncanny, folkloric spirits. An example of one such romantic ballet is La Sylphide, one of the oldest romantic ballets still performed today.|$|E
