2500|$|Barakat {{said the}} writing process {{consisted}} of Gaskarth [...] "writing songs and us going into the studio to put in our two cents and changing <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>things</b> around." [...] In an interview with Just So You Know, Gaskarth said the album title [...] "summarizes {{the theme of the}} songs, most of which centralize around escapism; running from my problems, burning bridges because of those problems; and the realization that its hard work to rebuild after those problems have torn people apart." [...] In an interview with MTV, Gaskarth said that the title was inspired [...] "by the subject matter on the record, where it's this toss-up of being wrapped up in what we do, and having the fun and the good times, and kind of pulling that blindfold down in order to ignore the fact that other problems are crumbling around you". Gaskarth also said [...] "one of the big things that came along with this album ... a lot of anxiety. About where were we going to go". Gaskarth said the band purposely sought to [...] "step outside of the box and do some things that were a bit scary." [...] He mentioned that [...] "there's one [...] that starts with classical guitar playing something that sounds like it could be out of vaudeville and it's that kind of thing that we really decided to go for on this record." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The Ballad of Mona Lisa" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} by Alternative Press as [...] " [...] the upbeat pop energy of A Fever You Can't Sweat Out, with the focus and clarity of Pretty. Odd." [...] Urie has explained that he and Smith desired to achieve a sound that is more similar to the former: [...] "We missed <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>things</b> from our first record in terms of sonically, with these little instruments that we hadn’t really used on our second record. There [...] a lot of organic instruments and not a lot of electronics or synthesizers. So we wanted to get back to some of that." [...] Smith agreed, and stated [...] "I think there's stuff from the first album that we kind of got away from on the second record that people who were fans of the first one will enjoy." [...] "The Calendar", originally written about an intimate relationship between a male and a female, soon began to resemble the friendships in former members Ross and Walker; the song was finished as a direct response to their departure from the group. [...] "Sarah Smiles" [...] was written for Urie's wife. [...] "'Sarah Smiles' is about my girlfriend, actually, as sappy as that is," [...] he told Spin in 2011. [...] "When I met her I wrote this song to try and impress her. I was infatuated with her. I played it for her and we've been dating ever since. That was a huge step for me, personally." [...] "Nearly Witches (Ever Since We Met...)" [...] was rejected for inclusion on Pretty. Odd. due it not fitting within the concept of the album; Urie and Smith finished the song for Vices & Virtues.|$|E

5000|$|... 'We Got the Beat' {{has been}} one of my {{favorite}} songs for a long time. The song in itself and the vibe is all really really great. I kind of updated it a bit more, put it a little 2011. You hear some stutters and <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>things</b> that are in pop music.

5000|$|The {{first major}} {{partnership}} event between Iowa and Kosovo involved the Iowan National Guard’s Regional Training Institute {{spending more than}} two weeks in Kosovo teaching the first Kosovo Security Force Senior Noncommissioned Officer Course. “This course was in development when the NCO leadership of Iowa visited Kosovo in September,” Army CSM Rachel Fails said. “So, it did <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>things</b> for us besides give us, the state partner, information and knowledge of the KSF.

I also hope to close <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of <b>things</b> in the TV and film worlds that I have been concentrating on - and, again, once things are real, I’ll dish the details. Camp Freddy has some shows lined up which we’ll announce nearer the time, and the band also has plans for some “extra curricular activities.” So I suppose you could say that 2009 holds a lot of diverse possibilities for me.|$|R

50|$|On August 18, 2016, Byron and Hendrick Motorsports {{announced}} they have signed a multi-year driver agreement, with Byron running full-time in the Xfinity Series driving the No. 9 Chevrolet Camaro for JR Motorsports in 2017.

He ended up winning again the week later at Daytona after having <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>things</b> going his way towards the end.

5000|$|Another {{thing that}} makes canon a little confusing. Gene R. himself {{had a habit of}} decanonizing things. He didn't like the way the {{animated}} series turned out, so he proclaimed that it was not canon. He also didn't like a lot of the movies. So he didn't much consider them canon either. And - okay, I'm really going to scare you with this one - after he got TNG going, he... well... he sort of decided that some of The Original Series wasn't canon either. I had a discussion with him once, where I cited <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>things</b> that were very clearly canon in The Original Series, and he told me he didn't think that way anymore, and that he now thought of TNG as canon wherever there was conflict between the two. He admitted it was revisionist thinking, but so be it.— Paula Block, 2005 ...|$|E
