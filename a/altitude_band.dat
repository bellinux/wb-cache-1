40|$|Previous {{research}} relating {{airspace structure}} and ca-pacity {{has shown that}} a decentralized layered airspace concept, in which each <b>altitude</b> <b>band</b> limited horizontal travel to within a prede?ned heading range, improved safety when compared to unstructured airspace. However, {{the extent of the}} safety bene?ts of such layered airspace designs were not quanti?ed. To this end, in this paper, con?ict rate models are developed to determine the intrinsic safety of unstructured and layered airspace designs. In comparison to previous work, the present models consider con-?icts between aircraft in different ?ight phases. Thus, con?icts for climbing and descending traf?c, as well as for cruising aircraft, are taken into account when computing the total con?ict rate. To validate the models, fast-time simulations were performed for several different layered airspace concepts, and for unstructured airspace. The results indicate that the models are able to estimate the con?ict rate for high traf?c densities using a model ?t for low densities. When comparing the different layered airspace concepts tested, the model predicted, and the simulation results con?rmed, a clear safety improvement when the permitted heading range per <b>altitude</b> <b>band</b> is reduced.

This thesis develops two different control strategies based on the osculating orbital parameters. taking a conservative approach to keeping within altitude limitations. Thrust is in the local horizontal plane along the direction of flight. Single and dual burn maneuvers are considered for various bandwidths and thruster sizes. The dual burn strategy is somewhat close to a Hohmann transfer. The specified orbital band is generally maintained, with some cases slightly exceeding the upper limit. Propellant consumptions for both maneuvers is significantly better than previous methods.

The model also includes a feedback controller on ADR where the number of removals is proportional to orbital population. The proposed control mimics the human-driven corrective actions arising from the review and adaptation of debris mitigation policies. The model is validated and then preliminary results are reported.

The number of such events is insufficient to fully define their morphology but enough to provide an indication of the wave amplitudes, scale sizes, occurrence altitudes, and local time variation. The density variations were quasi-sinusoidal, with wavelengths of the order of 1 km along the nearly horizontal trajectory near periapsis. Nearly all of the wave events were encountered within an <b>altitude</b> <b>band</b> lying between 140 and 160 km, a region containing the steep negative N(sub e) gradient just above the ionospheric peak. The waves generally did not fill the occurrence band but were seen primarily as isolated events on curves taken intermittently as PVO crossed through the band. Peak-to-trough amplitudes ((Delta) N/N) were in the range of 5 % to 50 %. The waves exhibited little local time variation within the available viewing period (01 - 04 hrs), with perhaps a tendency for the waves to rise to slightly higher altitudes toward dawn. The latitudinal extent of the waves could not be resolved because volt-ampere curves were obtained only intermittently, however, their occurrence on both inbound and outbound passages through the wave band suggests that the waves sometimes exist in layers that extend over at least 15 deg of latitude. The generation mechanism for these waves is unknown, but we suspect that it involves the steep density gradient that separates the main nightside ionosphere from the tenuous, and probably rapidly flowing plasma above...|$|E

Mars Pathfinder landed 27 km downrange of its prediction [1], Spirit and Opportunity landed 13. 4 km and 14. 9 km, respectively, downrange from their predictions [2], and Phoenix landed 21 km downrange from its prediction [3]. Reconstruction of their entries revealed a lower density profile {{than the best}} a priori atmospheric model predictions. Do {{these results suggest that}} there is a systemic issue in present Mars atmosphere models that predict a higher density than observed on landing day? Spirit Landing: The landing location for Spirit was 13. 4 km downrange of the prediction as shown in Fig. 1. The navigation errors upon Mars arrival were very small [2]. As such, the entry interface conditions were not responsible for this downrange landing. Consequently, experiencing a lower density during the entry was the underlying cause. The reconstructed density profile that Spirit experienced is shown in Fig. 2, which is plotted as a fraction of the pre-entry baseline prediction that was used for all the entry, descent, and landing (EDL) design analyses. The reconstructed density is observed to be less dense throughout the descent reaching a maximum reduction of 15 % at 21 km. This lower density corresponded to approximately a 1 - low profile relative to the dispersions predicted. Nearly all the deceleration during the entry occurs within 10 - 50 km.

In the daytime, the large-scale waves assume a non-steady dynamical equilibrium state characterized by the straining and destruction of the waves by shear and diffusion followed by spontaneous regeneration as predicted by Ronchi et al. [1991]. At night, when steep plasma density gradients emerge, slowly propagating large-scale vertically extended waves predominate. Eikonal analysis suggests that these waves are trapped (absolutely unstable) or are nearly trapped (convectively unstable) and able tunnel between altitude regions which are locally unstable. Intermediate-scale waves are mainly transient (convectively stable) but can become absolutely unstable in narrow <b>altitude</b> <b>bands</b> determined by the background density profile. These characteristics are mainly consistent with the simulations presented by Hu and Bhattacharjee [1999]. A new class of large-scale primary waves is found to occur along bands that sweep westward and downward from high altitudes through the E region at twilight. 1...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{submitted}} to the AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control Conference held at Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center, National Harbor (Maryland), 13 - 17 of January 2014. Operational flight loads have been analyzed from two business jets, a Global 5000 and a Global Express XRS. It is shown that due to the differing nature of their missions, both airframes were subjected to nearly {{the same number of}} ground-air-ground cycles, even though the flight times were much different. Flights have been divided into various phases, and loads and turbulence data have been categorized by <b>altitude</b> <b>bands</b> within each phase. Cumulative occurrences of incremental vertical gust load factors have been compared and shown to be comparable for the two airframes. Maneuver load factors have been shown to spread over a wider range of values for the 5000 in every phase. This has been confirmed through comparison of combined loads with those from a CRJ 100 and an ERJ- 145 XR. Some derived and continuous gust velocities, obtained from the load factors are presented, along with generalized exceedance curves and their comparison with FAA-ADS- 53 at various altitudes. These results from both aircraft are shown to agree well, but show significantly lower frequencies of exceedance than expected. It is suggested that the gust alleviation factor used in these calculations should be reexamined for modern more flexible aircraft using a much larger volume of data...|$|R
40|$|Large-scale (l ~ 1 km) {{waves in}} the daytime and night-time {{equatorial}} electrojet are studied using coherent scatter radar data from Jicamarca. Images of plasma irregularities within the main beam of the radar are formed using interferometry with multiple baselines. These images are analyzed according to nonlocal gradient drift instability theory and are also compared to nonlinear computer simulations carried out recently by Ronchi et al. (1991) and Hu and Bhattacharjee (1999). In the daytime, the large-scale waves assume a non-steady dynamical equilibrium state characterized by the straining and destruction of the waves by shear and diffusion followed by spontaneous regeneration as predicted by Ronchi et al.
