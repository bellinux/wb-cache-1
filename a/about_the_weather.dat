Creating an airlift presented the AAF a considerable challenge in 1942: it had no units trained or equipped for moving cargo, and no airfields existed in the China Burma India Theater (CBI) for basing the large number of transports that would be needed. Flying over the Himalayas was extremely dangerous and made more difficult by a lack of reliable charts, an absence of radio navigation aids, and a dearth of information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather.</b>|$|E
25|$|CVR {{transcript}} contains {{details of}} extensive discussion amongst {{the crew members}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> en route and over Kinshasa. First indication of Crew's realization {{of the presence of}} bad weather en route to Kinshasa was evident at 12:37, when the aircraft was between position GURUT and UDRID, over 100 NMs from Kinshasa. The crew got this indication through their on-board weather radar. At 12:38, the crew again discussed the weather when the Captain said that the (radar) beam was clearly showing the clouds. extended communication amongst the crew of extreme bad weather being present at and around Kinshasa and the way to avoid it, is heard on the CVR. The co-pilot exclaimed at 12:45 that the weather return being picked up on their radar was very big. Crew also discussed that the clouds were moving, so in next 10 minutes needed to reach the airfield, the clouds would have moved off the airfield. They also seemed to have a doubt whether the returns being picked up on the weather radar were ground echoes or were severe weather (Magenta) indications. The co-pilot confirmed that the returns were not ground echoes but were radar returns (Magenta) from very severe weather.|$|E

In 1998–99 fog caused the third Test against Zimbabwe was abandoned without a ball being bowled, while bad light is often an issue especially for matches played during the winter. However, when play has been possible, some memorable performances have taken place. An exciting Test was played out in 1997–98 when South Africa skittles Pakistan for 92, successfully defending a target of 142 on the final day. Then, in 2004–05, Sanath Jayasuriya smashed 253 as Sri Lanka powered to a 201-run victory. But the ground is most famous for the confrontation between Mike Gatting and Shakoor Rana during England's 1987–88 tour, which led to a day being lost during the match and some long-lasting bad feeling between the teams.PCB(Pakistan Cricket Board) also conducts its domestic tournaments at this venue.Recencently, Super 8 T20 was held here from 11 to 18 May.The stadium itself is only 2km out of the city centre, which can be reached by a walk through the tree-lined suburbs.|$|E

500|$|Keats's {{notes and}} papers do {{not reveal the}} precise dating of the 1819 odes. Literary {{scholars}} have proposed several different orders of composition, arguing that the poems form a sequence within their structures. In The Consecrated Urn, Bernard Blackstone observes that [...] "Indolence" [...] has been variously thought the first, second, and final of the five 1819 odes. Biographer Robert Gittings suggests [...] "Ode on Indolence" [...] was written on 4May 1819, based upon Keats's report <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> during the ode's creation; Douglas Bush insists it was written after [...] "Nightingale", [...] "Grecian Urn", and [...] "Melancholy". Based on his examination of the stanza forms, Keats biographer Andrew Motion thinks [...] "Ode on Indolence" [...] was written after [...] "Ode to Psyche" [...] and [...] "Ode to a Nightingale", although he admits {{there is no way}} to be precise about the dates.

500|$|One {{of the few}} primary network {{programs}} {{outside of}} news and sports that Mutual initiated during this era {{became one of the}} most successful in its history: the first nationwide, all-night call-in radio program, which launched on November 3, 1975, with Herb Jepko as host. Jepko, who had run a telephone talk show out of KSL in Salt Lake City for years, so determinedly avoided controversy that some callers simply talked <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> where they lived. Jepko was briefly succeeded by Long John Nebel, before Mutual tapped a local talk show host at WIOD in Miami. Larry King made his national debut on Mutual on January 30, 1978; by 1980, his show was being carried by around 200 stations and was credited with attracting many new affiliates to the network. King continued his Mutual call-in show until 1994, even after he began appearing on CNN television in 1985.

500|$|The {{report from}} the Accident Investigation Board was highly {{critical}} to the Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration, stating that the airport {{should never have been}} built where it was and that it was [...] "clearly unsuitable for regular traffic". It stated that the administration had overlooked comments from meteorologists and test flights in the area that had concluded that the wind conditions in the area were not suitable for an airport. The commission that wrote the report and conducted the investigation, stated that the Civil Aviation Administration had not proceeded correctly while planning the airport—they had chosen Nordlandet early as a location and ignored negative comments. After the Norwegian Meteorological Institute had made a favorable report <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> in the area, the administration had failed to conduct the necessary test flights to test the wind conditions, since this was not determined in the initial recommendation. The commission also commented that the safety division had been critical to the localization of the airport, but had withdrawn their disputes following pressure from higher ranks in the administration. The commission also criticized the Civil Aviation Administration for not conducting investigations following the reports of low regularity and the incidents in 1988 and 1989.|$|E
