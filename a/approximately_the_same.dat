5|$|The Sun's {{distance}} from Earth is about 400 times the Moon's distance, and the Sun's diameter is about 400 times the Moon's diameter. Because these ratios are <b>approximately</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> the Sun and the Moon {{as seen from}} Earth appear to be <b>approximately</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> size: about 0.5 degree of arc in angular measure.|$|E

5|$|St. Augustine (354430) {{believed}} that the determinism of astrology conflicted with the Christian doctrines of man's free will and responsibility, and God not being the cause of evil, but he also grounded his opposition philosophically, citing the failure of astrology to explain twins who behave differently although conceived {{at the same moment}} and born at <b>approximately</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time.|$|E

5|$|Apart from meteors {{within the}} {{atmosphere}} and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west {{at a rate of}} 15°/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the celestial equator, this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are <b>approximately</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b>|$|E
5|$|As all {{the stars}} of a {{globular}} cluster are at <b>approximately</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> distance from us, their absolute magnitudes differ from their visual magnitude by about the same amount. The main-sequence stars in the globular cluster will fall along a line that {{is believed to be}} comparable to similar stars in the solar neighborhood. The accuracy of this assumption is confirmed by comparable results obtained by comparing the magnitudes of nearby short-period variables, such as RR Lyrae stars and cepheid variables, with those in the cluster.|$|E

However, the Germans had held {{the centre of the}} battlefield for almost the entire day, and this had stalled the French advance.|$|E

Estimates of rate of occurrence of short-duration GRBs are even more uncertain because of the unknown degree of collimation, but are probably comparable.|$|E
