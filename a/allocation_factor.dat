40|$|International audienceSludge {{is slowly}} {{moving away from}} {{providing}} basic by-products and towards providing value-added products (e. g. fertilisers); therefore, {{it is no longer}} perceived as waste but as a product. Consequently, wastewater treatment plants become multifunctional systems that produce two coproducts that are given a second life: sludge and “clean” water. An <b>allocation</b> <b>factor</b> in Life Cycle Assessment can partition environmental burdens of wastewater treatment between these two products, but doing so remains highly challenging. To address this challenge, we followed a four-step procedure to develop an <b>allocation</b> <b>factor</b> using a mesoscopic approach and process- and product-related parameters in a mathematical model. The first two steps consisted of determining and mathematically representing process- and product-related parameters and their associations to define a global <b>allocation</b> <b>factor.</b> The third step consisted of constructing a corrective inventory matrix to adjust the global <b>allocation</b> <b>factor,</b> since inventory flows can be specific to certain processes. The last step consisted of mathematical modelling of the final corrected <b>allocation</b> <b>factor.</b> Based on the parameters chosen, the global <b>allocation</b> <b>factor</b> equalled 45 % for sludge and 55 % for water. A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the sludge <b>allocation</b> <b>factor,</b> which varied from 39 to 49 %. The <b>allocation</b> <b>factor</b> developed reflects technological performances of the system and considers environmental impacts of sludge production to assess environmental impacts of value-added sludge-based products...|$|E

40|$|Cognitive radio (CR) is a {{promising}} solution {{to address the}} more and more congested radio spectrum. Cooperative relaying can provide a better transmission performance for the secondary user (SU), while {{the performance of the}} primary user (PU, also named licensed user) should be preferentially protected especially when there is misdetection probability. In this paper, {{in order to keep the}} PU away from outage caused by the interference from the SU under a certain signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the maximum SNR for the SU can be derived by using the rate decaying factor (RDF). Then, based on the maximum channel gain and the maximum SNR, the outage probability is analyzed using decode-and-forward (DF) relaying and amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying schemes. Numerical results show that the outage probability decreases when the power <b>allocation</b> <b>factor</b> increases for DF strategy, while the outage probability has error floor when the power <b>allocation</b> <b>factor</b> increases for AF strategy. And the relaying scheme based on the maximum channel gain outperforms that based on the maximum SNR when the power <b>allocation</b> <b>factor</b> and detection probability are small, while the relaying scheme based on the maximum SNR outperforms that based on the maximum channel gain when the power <b>allocation</b> <b>factor</b> is large.

40|$|In WiMAX 16 m networks, buffer {{allocation}} is {{the major}} problem to be handled for offering Quality of Service (QoS). The lack of buffers increases the packet loss and queuing delay. In this study we propose a fuzzy based dynamic buffer management in WiMAX 16 m network. The Base Station (BS) estimates the parameters such as number of user requests, flow rate, queue length and received signal strength for each user and updates them periodically. When a request arrives at BS, buffer <b>allocation</b> <b>factor</b> is estimated by applying fuzzy logic over these parameters. Then the flow request with high buffer <b>allocation</b> <b>factor</b> is admitted first and rest of the flow requests waits in a queue. Upon new request arrival, if its buffer <b>allocation</b> <b>factor</b> is low, the request is rejected. Otherwise, the pending request packet in the queue is emptied on analyzing their channel condition and buffer is allocated for new request.

40|$|Processing biomass into {{multifunctional}} {{products can}} contribute to food, feed, and energy security while also mitigating climate change. However, biorefinery products nevertheless impact the environment, and this influence needs to be properly assessed to minimize the burden. Life cycle assessment (LCA) {{is often used to}} calculate environmental footprints of products, but distributing the burdens among the different biorefinery products is a challenge. A particular complexity arises when the outputs are a combination of energy carrying no mass, and mass carrying no energy, where neither an allocation based on mass nor on energy would be appropriate. A novel hybrid mass–energy (HMEN) allocation scheme for dealing with multifunctionality problems in biorefineries was developed and applied to five biorefinery concepts. The results were compared to results of other allocation methods in LCA. The reductions in energy use and GHG emissions from using the biorefinery's biofuels were also quantified. HMEN fairly distributed impacts among biorefinery products and did not change the order of the products in terms of the level of the pollution caused. The <b>allocation</b> <b>factors</b> for HMEN fell between mass and economic <b>allocation</b> <b>factors</b> and were comparable to energy <b>allocation</b> <b>factors.</b> Where the mass or the energy allocation failed to attribute burdens, HMEN addressed this shortcoming by assigning impacts to nonmass or to nonenergy products. Under the partitioning methods and regardless of the feedstock used, bioethanol reduced GHG by 72 – 98 % relative to gasoline. The GHG savings were 196 % under the substitution method, but no GHG savings occurred for sugar beet bioethanol under the surplus method. Bioethanol from cellulosic crops had lower energy use and GHG emissions than from sugar beet, regardless of the allocation method used. HMEN solves multifunctional problems in biorefineries and can be applied to other complex refinery systems. LCA practitioners are encouraged to further test this method in other case studies...|$|R

We study the optimal power allocation to maximize the secondary user’s instantaneous data rate and long-term throughput, without degrading the primary user’s spectrum utilization. Our numerical results suggest that these two performance criteria entail drastically different optimal behaviors by the secondary user. Furthermore, we observe that employing successive interference cancellation in relaying can significantly increase the instantaneous data rate, but after optimizing the power <b>allocation</b> <b>factor,</b> the simple decode-andforward strategy almost always achieves the same throughput as the more complicated strategies.
