[...] He noted he was joining a Yankee team that expects to win all the time: [...] "That's why I'm most excited about it. Sometimes I felt I got caught up kind of going into the clubhouse nonchalantly sometimes, because all the other guys in the clubhouse didn't go there with one goal in mind." ...|$|E

Upon arrival he is {{questioned}} by US Customs and Border Protection agents about the purpose of his visit as they are concerned he {{will remain in the}} country and work illegally. King assures them he is on holidays and will be returning to South Africa in 5 days time. He checks himself into a motel and goes over to the last address he had for her where he is informed by Trish, her neighbour, that she moved out a few months ago after getting into some trouble. King admits to having a falling out with her which prompted her to leave South Africa though they still kept in contact up until a month ago. Not knowing where Bianca went Trish gives him a bag of Bianca's belongings and says that maybe her landlord knows where Bianca went. Trish also invites King to a party saying there are a few people who knew Bianca that <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there.</b> King goes to the landlord's house who described Bianca as a party girl who was forced to take custody of her husband Alex's son, Armand, after Alex walked out on them.

5000|$|A sickly {{girl who}} arrives {{later in the}} manga because she has been hospitalized since before the start. She appears to be Kawai's {{opposite}} in every way as she is cheerful and popular. When she first returned to school, she noticed the necklace the teacher took from Kawai which he then gives her (seemingly {{as a way to}} get Kawai expelled in hopes she would attack Hana to get it back), however, she instead tries to befriend Kawai which goes well. Until she discovers that Yusuke confessed to Kawai, as she has feelings for Yusuke and even asked earlier if Kawai had feelings for him, which she denied but believes she is lying. Because of her outbursts, Kawai believes that she is only doing this because she likes the attention. Which maybe true as with anything that happens she is prone to emotional outbursts that get the rest of the classes attention in the matter, shown where Kawai causally pointed out that the cross was missing from the necklace, only for her to have an emotional outburst about it being missing. At the end of chapter 17 it appears that Hana is losing her sanity, smiling evilly with a blank look in her eyes. Later she conspires with the classmates against Kawai to have everyone hate her by setting her up with vicious comments about the other students in her bag, however this seems to quickly falls apart when Shin points out that she says what she feels without hesitation and wouldn't write that, as well as Kawai seeing through Hana's [...] "help". However, later she sets Kawai up to make it look like she really did write it and ultimately suggests splitting up the group. In the end is stated to be the head of the group. This causes Kawai to show aggression for the first time, as she was truly dedicated to her role as the Choir Leader and correcting Hana when she thought that Kawai hated her, where she just didn't see her as a friend, calling her a Bad Friend. However, Hana finally shows her true colors and confirms that the teachers only set up Kawai as the Leader as a way to promote the school. Hana makes a conspiracy against Kawai to make herself look good at the choir competition. Hana finds out that reporters <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there.</b> She gets even madder when Kawai ruins her plan 'accidentally' and bursts with anger in front of the camera. The reporters realize that Hana and everyone are misunderstanding Kawai.|$|E
