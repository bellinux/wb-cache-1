5|$|The park {{is among}} the most biologically diverse of Turkey's {{national}} parks. It is the native and migratory habitat of hundreds of species of birds, mammals, plants, and marine life, some of which are entirely endemic to the park and cannot be observed <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the world. For these reasons, it is protected by numerous wildlife and wetland conventions, and is of great national and international importance in these areas.|$|E

5|$|A major {{development}} of this period was the appearance of stellate (star-shaped) shrines in a few temples built of the traditional sandstone, such as the Trimurti Temple at Savadi, the Paramesvara Temple at Konnur and the Gauramma Temple at Hire Singgangutti. In all three cases, the shrine is a 16-pointed uninterrupted star, a ground-plan not found <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> India and which entirely differentiates these temples from the 32-pointed interrupted star plans of bhumija shrines in northern India.|$|E

5|$|Roman troops, however, {{penetrated}} {{far into}} the north of modern Scotland several more times. Indeed, {{there is a greater}} density of Roman marching camps in Scotland than <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> Europe, as a result of at least four major attempts to subdue the area. The Antonine Wall was occupied again for a brief period after 197. The most notable invasion was in 209 when the emperor Septimius Severus, claiming to be provoked by the belligerence of the Maeatae, campaigned against the Caledonian Confederacy. Severus invaded Caledonia with an army perhaps over 40,000 strong.|$|E
5|$|Sebum, {{secreted}} by the {{sebaceous gland}} in humans, is primarily composed of triglycerides (~41%), wax esters (~26%), squalene (~12%), and {{free fatty acids}} (~16%). The composition of sebum varies across species. Wax esters and squalene are unique to sebum and not produced as final products <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the body. Sapienic acid is a sebum fatty acid that is unique to humans, and is implicated {{in the development of}} acne. Sebum is odorless, but its breakdown by bacteria can produce strong odors.|$|E

5|$|Formal {{education}} has a longer history in Gyeongju than <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> South Korea. The Gukhak, or national academy, was established here in 682, {{at the beginning}} of the Unified Silla period. Its curriculum focused on the Confucian classics for local officials. After the fall of Silla in the 10th century, the Gukhak closed. However, due to Gyeongju's role as a provincial center under the Goryeo and early Joseon dynasties, the city was home to state-sponsored provincial schools (hyanggyo) under both dynasties such as Gyeongju Hyanggyo. During the later Joseon dynasty there were several seowon, or private Confucian academies, were set up in the city such as Oksan Seowon and Seoak Seowon.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 {{the average}} price of a {{detached}} house in Christchurch was £323,416. On average property in Christchurch is 24% more expensive than <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> England and Wales. Nearly 80% of residences are owner occupied, 3% are vacant and a further 3% are second homes. The borough has around 25,000 cars: an average of 1.21 per household. Christchurch, in common with the rest of Dorset, has lower crime rates than average for the UK. Reported crime rates per 1,000 of the population in 2006 (with figures for 2001 in brackets) are as follows: violence against the person 10.4 (4.8), sexual offences 0.7 (0.3), robbery 0.2 (0.3), burglary 2.2 (4.0), theft of vehicles 0.9 (2.5), theft from vehicles 3.6 (7.2).|$|E

5|$|Many of Titan's craters or {{probable}} craters display {{evidence of}} extensive erosion, and all show {{some indication of}} modification. Most large craters have breached or incomplete rims, {{despite the fact that}} some craters on Titan have relatively more massive rims than those <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the Solar System. There is little evidence of formation of palimpsests through viscoelastic crustal relaxation, unlike on other large icy moons. Most craters lack central peaks and have smooth floors, possibly due to impact-generation or later eruption of cryovolcanic lava. Infill from various geological processes is one reason for Titan's relative deficiency of craters; atmospheric shielding also plays a role. It is estimated that Titan's atmosphere reduces the number of craters on its surface by a factor of two.|$|E
5|$|Wallace visits Menado on the {{northeast}} coast of Celebes. The people of the Minahasa region are fair-skinned, unlike <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the archipelago. He stays high in the mountains by the coffee plantations, and is often cold, but finds that the animals are no different from those lower down. The forest was full of orchids, bromeliads, clubmosses and mosses. He experiences an earthquake, but the low timber-framed houses survive with little damage. He finds that the people, {{under the guidance of}} missionaries, are the most hard-working, peaceful and civilised of the whole archipelago. He obtains (apparently by purchase) skulls of the babirusa (pig-deer) and the rare sapiutan (midget buffalo).|$|E
5|$|Overlapping the {{military}} chain of command, {{there was a}} plenipotentiary of the Foreign Office, Felix Benzler, reporting to the Foreign Minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, and for economic affairs, a representative of Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, Franz Neuhausen. These power structures competed with each other, {{to a greater extent}} than <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> occupied Europe. Meyszner's appointment further complicated an already complex situation, as prior to this decision, Turner had been responsible for police and security matters. Meyszner had to formally acknowledge Bader as his superior but received his orders from Hitler and Himmler. One of his priorities was to improve coordination of policies towards the Volksdeutsche (or Germans of Yugoslavia), concentrated in the Banat region, as the decision had been made in late 1941 to subject them to conscription in order to raise a Waffen-SS division. This decision, approved by Hitler a few days before Meyszner's appointment, had strengthened Himmler's case for a HSSPF in Belgrade.|$|E
5000|$|A {{predicate}} {{for this}} relation, using the attribute names to denote free variables, might be [...] "Employee number ID {{is known as}} Name and lives at Address". Examination of the relation tells us that there are just four tuples for which the predicate holds true.

5|$|The oldest {{structures}} on St Kilda {{are the most}} enigmatic. Large sheepfolds lie inland from the existing village at An Lag Bho'n Tuath (English: the hollow in the north) and contain curious 'boat-shaped' stone rings, or 'settings'. Soil samples suggest a date of 1850 BC, but they are unique to St Kilda, and their purpose is unknown. In Gleann Mòr, (north-west of Village Bay beyond Hirta's central ridge), there are 20 'horned structures', essentially ruined buildings with a main court measuring about , two or more smaller cells and a forecourt formed by two curved or horn-shaped walls. Again, nothing like them exists <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> Britain or Europe, and their original use is unknown. Also in Gleann Mòr is Taigh na Banaghaisgeich, the 'Amazon's House'. As Martin (1703) reported, many St Kilda tales are told about this female warrior.|$|E
5|$|In September 1183, {{construction}} of the Cairo Citadel began under Saladin's orders. According to al-Maqrizi, Saladin chose the Muqattam Hills to build the citadel because the air there was fresher than <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the city, but its construction {{was not so much}} determined by the salubrious atmosphere; rather it was out of defensive necessity and example of existing fortresses and citadels in Syria. The walls and towers of the northern section of the citadel are largely the works of Saladin and al-Kamil. Two of Saladin's towers were totally encased by semi-circular units. Al-Kamil completed the citadel; he strengthened and enlarged some of the existing towers, and also added a number of square towers which served as self-contained keeps. According to Richard Yeomans, the most impressive of al-Kamil's structures was the series of massive rectangular keeps which straddled the walls of the northern enclosure. All of al-Kamil's fortifications can be identified by their embossed, rusticated masonry, whereas Saladin's towers have smooth dressed stones. This heavier rustic style became a common feature in other Ayyubid fortifications, and {{can be seen in the}} Citadel of Damascus and that of Bosra in Syria.|$|E
5|$|To {{prevent any}} similar {{incidents}} from reoccurring, Nintendo quickly ordered the episode pulled, {{and it has}} not aired since, not even outside Japan. Maddie Blaustein, the English dub voice of Meowth, said twice on the Serebii.net forums that this episode was dubbed in the United States by 4Kids Entertainment. On the other hand, Veronica Taylor, the English voice of Ash, claimed that this episode was never dubbed and will not be dubbed, though this was contradicted again on September 25, 2016, when Eric Stuart, the English dub voice of Brock and James, said that 4Kids did indeed dub the episode. Regardless, any plans to release this episode outside Japan were abandoned after Nintendo objected, and it was never broadcast <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the world. Coincidentally, the episode aired around the same time Pokémon was being adapted for American audiences. 4Kids Entertainment's dub took extra precaution in bright and flashing lights in the show, using the post-1997 versions altering lighting and the frequency of flashing lights for earlier episodes of their American release.|$|E
