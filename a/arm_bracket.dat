40|$|Shape {{optimisation}} of continuum structures {{is concerned}} with changes to the external boundary of a structure to reach the optimum design. A structure {{is said to be}} optimal, if the objective function has the greatest degree of merit and the structure itself satisfies both the geometry and behaviour constraints at the same time. Genetic Algorithms (GA) are used as the optimisation tool in this work, because they have the distinct 'feature of multi-point local and global searches. Therefore, GA provide a better chance to obtain the global optimum solution.. ' The aim of this work is to apply GA to the problem of shape optimisation. Past research has concentrated in applying the Binary-coding GA (BGA) to shape optimisation. In this method, where shape modification is achieved by allowing the Boundary Points (BP), which are attached to the design boundary, to move unit step-wise in a specific direction in 2 D space. The presented work extends this method by allowing the BP to have multidirection movement. Three examples with different movement cases, including the Step-wise (SW), Step-wise Recursive (SWR), and Multi-direction (MD) are considered. The results indicated that the MD movement achieves the best optimum solution, followed by the SWR, and the SW movement method. In terms ofthe convergence rate, the SW method converges at the highest rate, followed by the SWR, and then MD method. Two adaptive methods, hybrid BP movement and step-size refinement, are introduced to improve the convergence rate and quality of the solution. The obtained results indicated that these adaptive methods produce better solutions With a higher convergence rate in comparison to individual BP movement met~ods. The adaptive methods are combined to optimise the shapes ofa spanner, torque <b>arm,</b> <b>bracket,</b> andÃ‚Â· 3 D structures. This work also investigates the robustness of different. types of crossovers fOf the Realcoding GA (RGA). This investigation is conducted because the crossovers for RGA were developed to have different search attributes, which would affect the qu?lity o~ the solution. The crossovers selected for the investigation are:~Single-point (ip), Two''p~int (2 p), Uniform (uni), Arithmetic (Ar), Geometric (Geo), Wright'S heuristic (WH), Blend crossover (BLX), Fuzzy Recombination (FR) and Simulated Binary crossover (SBX). In additional to the individual crossover investigation, the crossovers are combined to find the most robust operator for RGA. The combination of 'BLX, FR, and SBX is found to be the most rQbust crossover for RGA. In this work, the Fixed Grid Finite Element Analysis (FG-FEA) is used to determine the structural responses during the optImisation process. Past research has concentrated on the development and i~provement of the FG-FEA for 2 D structural analysis. As 3 D optimisation is undertaken in this work, it was necessary to extend the method to ' 3 D structural analysis. The computational methodology' of 3 D FG-FEA is presented in this thesis.

40|$|Glass façade {{systems in}} {{buildings}} {{are subject to}} racking action due to inter storey drift caused by earthquake and wind actions. The performance of façade systems {{is dependent on the}} amount of imposed drift and the interaction of the glass panels with the façade structural support frames. There are two major concerns related to the glass façade system performance during and immediately after a seismic event, hazards to people from falling glass and cost associated with building down time and repair. Glass façade systems can be classified into two types namely, framed glass façade system (FGFS) and point fixed glass façade system (PFGFS). It was observed that the damage to glass façade systems resulting from in-plane racking actions mainly earthquakes is increasingly common and yet there have been limited number of published research work available in this field. The research conducted to date mainly focused on traditional framed glass façade systems. However, the seismic performance of PFGFS is likely to be quite different from conventional framed systems. Therefore, the aim of the research presented in this thesis is to assess the inplane racking performance of PFGFS which is gaining popularity worldwide. Two unique full scale in-plane racking laboratory tests (Test # 1 and Test # 2) on typical PFGFS with different types of spider <b>arms</b> (<b>brackets</b> to connect the glass and the structural support frame) were conducted. Detailed 3 -D finite element models were developed and validated against the experimental test results to interpret the racking behaviour of PFGFS. Specific racking mechanisms were attributed to the drift capacity in each test. Further detailed FE analyses were conducted to evaluate the individual drift contributions of each racking mechanism such as rigid body translation at the built-in standard gaps, spider arm rotation and spider arm deformation. It was found that most of the drift capacity is attributed to the rigid body translation at the built-in standard gaps. The FE models were then used to predict the racking performance of PFGFS with different configurations. The seismic assessment of glass façade systems requires an estimate of the likely drift demand from the building. Codified provisions for in-plane drift limits on glass façade systems {{can be used as a}} conservative option. Analysis results presented in this thesis indicated that the inter-storey drift demand is much less than the 1. 5 % limit specified in AS 1170. 4 (2007) for most buildings in Australia for a 500 year return period seismic event except for soft storey structures. Standard seismic assessment procedures can be used to estimate the optimum in-plane seismic drift demands from the buildings. Based on that some rapid inter storey drift assessment methods were presented with example calculations. Conservatively, the in-plane racking capacity of PFGFS resulting from the rigid body translation of the glass panels at the built-in standard gaps can be used as the design in-plane drift capacity. If required, the drift capacity can be increased by introducing special articulation features at the bolted connections. Care should be taken at the boundary conditions of the perimeter glass panels to achieve the racking capacity of the PFGFS from the rigid body translation at the built-in gaps. In order to assist façade engineers, particularly at the conceptual design stage, a quick selection guide is presented to identify the structural components of PFGFS which can increase the racking performance of the façade system...|$|R
25|$|In {{semaphore}} areas, junctions are signalled using {{a series}} of between 2 and 5 stop signal <b>arms</b> on one <b>bracket</b> or gantry, known as splitting signals. Each arm (usually) has its own post ("doll") on the <b>bracket,</b> and each <b>arm</b> applies to one possible route. The relative heights of the dolls usually convey some information about the lines to which they apply, {{although there is no}} definite standard. In some cases, the tallest doll applies to the highest-speed route; in others, it applies to what the railway considered the most important route. Traditionally, splitting distant signals would be provided – {{a series of}} side-by-side distant signals telling the driver which doll on the following stop signal was off; but practice since the 1920s has erred towards providing just one distant which is locked at caution if a large speed reduction is necessary. Drivers of trains must know which signal arm applies to which route, and the speed limit on that route; accidents have resulted from drivers either mis-reading splitting signals or forgetting speed restrictions, and consequently approaching junctions too fast.|$|R

50|$|The Dening Hall is {{the main}} hall of the temple, and was built in 1270 during the Yuan Dynasty. The hall is fronted by a massive {{platform}} known as a yuetai (月台, literally moon platform), which measures 25 by 20 meters. Built on a very high platform itself, the Dening Hall can be accessed by either a center front staircases or one of two side staircases attached to the yuetai. Enclosing {{the perimeter of the}} platform is a white marble balustrade capped by lions. The hall itself measures seven by four bays and is surrounded by a covered arcade. According to the Yingzao Fashi, a Song Dynasty architectural treatise, the Dening Hall has 6th puzuo type column bracketing to support its roof. This type of bracketing has three transverse and three horizontal <b>bracket</b> <b>arms.</b> The 6th puzuo brackets are the most complex that survive from the Yuan Dynasty. Based on the complex bracketing, the marble balustrade and the height of the platform, Steinhardt identifies the Dening Hall as one of the two most eminent and important extant wooden halls that date from the Yuan period. These characteristics also closely match descriptions of the architecture at the capital, meaning that Dening Hall is representative of the architecture at the Yuan dynasty capital of Dadu (currently Beijing).|$|R
