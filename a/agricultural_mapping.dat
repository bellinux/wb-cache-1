This paper examines the results of applying multi-resolution segmentation and support vector machine in identifying agricultural features in a large area using the whole municipality of San Fernando as a test case. A varying scale parameter was used to obtain a decent object image. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was implemented to extract agricultural features from the segmented image. Although agricultural features were identified, misclassifications of some objects still exist. To lessen the misclassified objects, SVM was applied following a binary tree approach.

40|$|The Agricultural Resources Extraction from LiDAR Surveys (PARMAP) project {{component}} of the Nationwide Detailed Resources Assessment using LiDAR (Phil-LiDAR 2) Program aims to produce detailed <b>agricultural</b> <b>maps</b> using LiDAR. <b>Agricultural</b> land cover at crop level was classified through object based image analysis using Support Vector Machine as classifier and LiDAR derivatives from point cloud (2 points per sq. m.) and orthophoto (0. 5 -meter resolution) as inputs. An accuracy of at least 90  %, assessed using validation points {{from the field and}} through image interpretation, was required before proceeding to post-processing and map lay-out. Knowledge sharing and capacity development facilitated by the University of the Philippines Diliman (UPD) enabled partner universities across the Philippines to produce outputs for their assigned region. Considering output layers were generated by multiple teams working on different landscape complexities with some degree of data quality variability, quality checking is crucial to ensure accuracy standards were met. UPD PARMap devised a centralized and end-to-end scheme divided into four steps – land classification, GIS post-processing, schema application, and map lay-out. At each step, a block is reviewed and, subsequently, either approved or returned with documentation on required revisions. Turnaround time of review is at least one block (area ranging from 10 to 580  sq.  km.) per day. For coastal municipalities, an additional integration process to incorporate mapped coastal features was applied. Common problems observed during quality checking include misclassifications, gaps between features, incomplete attributes and missing map elements. Some issues are particular to specific blocks such as problematic LiDAR derivatives. UPD addressed these problems through discussion and mentoring visits to partner universities.

However currently the commercial hyperspectral systems still require minimum payload capacity of approximately 3 kg, forcing usage of rather large UAVs. In this article we present a lightweight hyperspectral mapping system (HYMSY) for rotor-based UAVs, the novel processing chain for the system, and its potential for <b>agricultural</b> <b>mapping</b> and monitoring applications. The HYMSY consists of a custom-made pushbroom spectrometer (400 – 950 nm, 9 nm FWHM, 25 lines/s, 328 px/line), a photogrammetric camera, and a miniature GPS-Inertial Navigation System. The weight of HYMSY in ready-to-fly configuration is only 2. 0 kg {{and it has been}} constructed mostly from off-the-shelf components. The processing chain uses a photogrammetric algorithm to produce a Digital Surface Model (DSM) and provides high accuracy orientation of the system over the DSM. The pushbroom data is georectified by projecting it onto the DSM with the support of photogrammetric orientations and the GPS-INS data. Since an up-to-date DSM is produced internally, no external data are required and the processing chain is capable to georectify pushbroom data fully automatically. The system has been adopted for several experimental flights related to agricultural and habitat monitoring applications. For a typical flight, an area of 2 – 10 ha was mapped, producing a RGB orthomosaic at 1 – 5 cm resolution, a DSM at 5 – 10 cm resolution, and a hyperspectral datacube at 10 – 50 cm resolution...|$|E
40|$|Remote {{sensing system}} mounted on {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle (UAV) could provide a complementary means to the conventional satellite and aerial remote sensing solutions especially for the applications of precision agriculture. UAV remote sensing offers a great flexibility to quickly acquire field data in sufficient spatial and spectral resolution at low cost. However a major problem of UAV is the high instability due to the low-end equipments and difficult environment situation, and this leads to image sensor being mostly operated under a highly uncertain configuration. Thus UAV images exhibit considerable derivation in spatial orientation, large geometric and spectral distortion, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To achieve the objectives of <b>agricultural</b> <b>mapping</b> from UAV, we apply a micro-helicopter UAV with a multiple spectral camera mounted and develop a framework to process UAV images. A very important processing is to generate mosaic image which can be aligned with maps for later GIS integration. With appropriate geometric calibration applied, we first decompose a homography of consecutive image pairs into a rotational component and a simple perspective component, and apply a linear interpolation to {{the angle of the}} rotational component, followed by a linear matrix interpolation operator to the perspective component, and this results in an equivalent transformation but ensures a smooth evolution between two images. Lastly to demonstrate the potential of UAV images to precision agriculture application, we perform spectral processing to derive vegetation indices (VIs) maps of crop, and also show the comparison with satellite imagery. Through this paper, we demonstrate that it is highly feasible to generate quantitative mapping products such as crop stress maps from UAV images, and suggest that UAV remote sensing is very valuable for the applications of precision agriculture...|$|E

40|$|Low-cost Unmanned Airborne Vehicles (UAVs) {{equipped}} with consumer-grade imaging systems {{have emerged as}} a potential remote sensing platform that could satisfy {{the needs of a}} wide range of civilian applications. Among these applications, UAV-based <b>agricultural</b> <b>mapping</b> and monitoring have attracted significant attention from both the research and professional communities. The interest in UAV-based remote sensing for agricultural management is motivated by the need to maximize crop yield. Remote sensing-based crop yield prediction and estimation are primarily based on imaging systems with different spectral coverage and resolution (e. g., RGB and hyperspectral imaging systems). Due to the data volume, RGB imaging is based on frame cameras, while hyperspectral sensors are primarily push-broom scanners. To cope with the limited endurance and payload constraints of low-cost UAVs, the agricultural research and professional communities have to rely on consumer-grade and light-weight sensors. However, the geometric fidelity of derived information from push-broom hyperspectral scanners is quite sensitive to the available position and orientation established through a direct geo-referencing unit onboard the imaging platform (i. e., an integrated Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS). This paper presents an automated framework for the integration of frame RGB images, push-broom hyperspectral scanner data and consumer-grade GNSS/INS navigation data for accurate geometric rectification of the hyperspectral scenes. The approach relies on utilizing the navigation data, together with a modified Speeded-Up Robust Feature (SURF) detector and descriptor, for automating the identification of conjugate features in the RGB and hyperspectral imagery. The SURF modification takes into consideration the available direct geo-referencing information to improve the reliability of the matching procedure in the presence of repetitive texture within a mechanized agricultural field. Identified features are then used to improve the geometric fidelity of the previously ortho-rectified hyperspectral data. Experimental results from two real datasets show that the geometric rectification of the hyperspectral data was improved by almost one order of magnitude...|$|E
40|$|The {{automation}} of <b>agricultural</b> <b>mapping</b> using satellite-derived remotely sensed data {{remains a}} challenge in Africa because of the heterogeneous and fragmental landscape, complex crop cycles, and limited access to local knowledge. Currently, consistent, continent-wide routine cropland mapping of Africa does not exist, with most studies focused either on certain portions of the continent or at most a one-time effort at mapping the continent at coarse resolution remote sensing. In this research, we addressed these limitations by applying an automated cropland mapping algorithm (ACMA) that captures extensive knowledge on the croplands of Africa available through: (a) ground-based training samples, (b) very high (sub-meter to five-meter) resolution imagery (VHRI), and (c) local knowledge captured during field visits and/or sourced from country reports and literature. The study used 16 -day time-series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) composited data at 250 -m resolution for the entire African continent. Based on these data, the study first produced accurate reference cropland layers or RCLs (cropland extent/areas, irrigation versus rainfed, cropping intensities, crop dominance, and croplands versus cropland fallows) for the year 2014 that provided an overall accuracy of around 90 % for crop extent in different agro-ecological zones (AEZs). The RCLs for the year 2014 (RCL 2014) were then used {{in the development of}} the ACMA algorithm to create ACMA-derived cropland layers for 2014 (ACL 2014). ACL 2014 when compared pixel-by-pixel with the RCL 2014 had an overall similarity greater than 95 %. Based on the ACL 2014, the African continent had 296 Mha of net cropland areas (260 Mha cultivated plus 36 Mha fallows) and 330 Mha of gross cropland areas. Of the 260 Mha of net cropland areas cultivated during 2014, 90. 6 % (236 Mha) was rainfed and just 9. 4 % (24 Mha) was irrigated. Africa has about 15 % of the world’s population, but only about 6 % of world’s irrigation. Net cropland area distribution was 95 Mha during season 1, 117 Mha during season 2, and 84 Mha continuous. About 58 % of the rainfed and 39 % of the irrigated were single crops (net cropland area without cropland fallows) cropped during either season 1 (January-May) or season 2 (June-September). The ACMA algorithm was deployed on Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform and applied on MODIS time-series data from 2003 through 2014 to obtain ACMA-derived cropland layers for these years (ACL 2003 to ACL 2014). The results indicated that over these twelve years, on average: (a) croplands increased by 1 Mha/yr, and (b) cropland fallows decreased by 1 Mha/year. Cropland areas computed from ACL 2014 for the 55 African countries were largely underestimated when compared with an independent source of census-based cropland data, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3. 5 Mha. ACMA demonstrated the ability to hind-cast (past years), now-cast (present year), and forecast (future years) cropland products using MODIS 250 -m time-series data rapidly, but currently, insufficient reference data exist to rigorously report trends from these results.

40|$|Global Monitoring for Food Security (GMFS) is a Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) Service Element (GSE) project, {{part of the}} European Space Agency (ESA) {{contribution}} to the European Union (EU) /ESA GMES Programme. GMFS aims to establish an operational service for crop monitoring in support of Food Security Monitoring to serve policy makers and operational users. The GMFS project started in March 2003 as part of Stage 1 of the ESA Earthwatch GMES services Element “Service Consolidation Actions”, and was continued in October 2005 {{as part of the}} Stage 2 of the ESA Earth watch GMES services Element – “Scaling Up Consolidated GMES Services”. In this document an overview is given of the work done throughout the previous six years. GMFS aimed at monitoring crop state /vegetation condition at continental and national scale. Low resolution Earth Observation (EO) data was used for monitoring purposes at continental scale, while at national scale products were based upon medium and high resolution data, field work and agro-meteorological models. The project was guided by a project strategy group with members from the United States Agency for International Development - Famine Early Warning System Network (USAID-FEWSNET), Directorate General for Development (DG-DEV), Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research - International Wheat Improvement Center (CGIAR-CIMMYT), European Commission Joint Research Center (EC-JRC), United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO). The goal of the project in Stage 1 (March 2003 –November 2004) was to consolidate an early warning system for food security. This started off by an intensive literature review and setting up an initial service for the Centre de Suivi Ecologique (CSE) in Dakar Senegal. In the second Phase of Stage 1 activities focussed more on the actual service delivery and setting up activities with users. Those activities included the monitoring agricultural production for Senegal, monitoring agriculture in Malawi and giving support to the Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission (CFSAM) of FAO /WFP. Additionally, services were set up for the centre Agro-Hydro-Météorologique (AGRHYMET) {{as a result of a}} meeting between AGHRYMET and Vlaamse Instelling voor Technologisch Onderzoek (VITO). During 2005 the early warning service was continued to support GMFS users although there was at that time no formal contract to do so. At the start of the Second Stage, in October 2005, a GMFS user executive board, consisting of one representative from: EC-JRC, FAO, WFP, Southern Africa Development Community Regional Remote Sensing Unit (SADC-RRSU), Regional Centre for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD) and AGRHYMET, was set up to support the consortium in defining the correct services and to review the work.

Consequently, more than 200 (new 50 in 2016) archaeological sites were identified throughout the area...|$|R
40|$|Monitoring {{change through}} remote sensing has {{numerous}} applications, such as monitoring <b>agricultural</b> lands, <b>mapping</b> noxious weeds, disaster monitoring, ecosystem monitoring, fire detection, {{and countless other}} applications. Currently, detecting changes of specific features between imagery over time is a slow, labor-intensive, painful, and costly process. Previous attempts to automate this process do not provide accurate enough information. This paper presents the first viable system for automating the target-specific change-detection process. Results on several datasets show our technique is accurate at extracting only changes of interest, saves {{a considerable amount of}} labor, has a simple user interface, and works directly within ArcGIS...|$|R
