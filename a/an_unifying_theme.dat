40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to place the {{writings}} of Charles Lamb in the context of his age. His work is assessed in relation to that of his friends and contemporaries, Coleridge, Wordsworth, Keats and Hazlitt, in order to ascertain how far he shared their characteristic preoccu- pations. Because of its central significance in the writings of the early English Romantics, and its problem- atic role in Lamb's own works, the concept of the imagination is employed as <b>an</b> <b>unifying</b> <b>theme</b> for this investigation. The introduction summarizes the history of Lamb r s reputation, and details in particular the fluctuations in critical opinion on the question of whether or not he can be considered a Romantic. In chapter one, Lamb's early relationship with Coleridge is described and its effects upon his imaginative development analyzed. The second chapter concerns itself with the damnation imagery rife throughout Lamb's work; what he makes of the theme is compared with its use in other contemporary writings. In chapter three, another characteristic subject of Lamb's, the glorification of childhood, is similarly analyzed and considered in the context of his age. The next three chapters deal primarily with Lamb's criticism. Chapter four illustrates his critical grasp and appreciation of the central Romantic concept of the imagination as an enhancer of consciousness. His strictures against the extreme 'egotistical sublime' aspects of Romanticism are detailed in the following chapter, mainly in relation to his criticisms of Wordsworth. His close involvement with another category of imaginative activity, the sympathetic imagination, is described in chapter six, and claims are made for his innovative function in its development. The final chapter relates the earlier findings to the Essays of Elia and concludes that a study of Lamb's writings may help to correct imbalances in the conventional idea of the spirit of the age. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study that aims to {{understand}} the pre, during and post visit behaviours of theme park visitors. This study took place at Janfusun Fancyworld, which is situated at Gukeng village Yun-Lin County, Taiwan. The park was the first Taiwanese theme park to achieve ISO 9002 and has hosted over 2 million visitors every year almost since its inception over a decade ago. By these criteria Janfusun is considered the leading theme park in Taiwan. Theme parks originally emerged from medieval and travelling fairs, but the success of locations such as Coney Island {{in the late nineteenth}} century introduced the element of exciting rides. At present the definition of a 'theme park' might be said to be an 'amusement park' that possesses a central theme based on history, fiction or other core. However, it is the researcher's own observation that Janfusun focuses more on the installation of hardware facilities, but pays less attention in creating <b>an</b> <b>unifying</b> <b>theme.</b> This situation may have affected the research outcome since Janfusun operates more as an 'amusement park' from a western perspective but markets itself as a 'theme park' within Taiwan, and is consistent with a Taiwanese understanding of the term of being a 'theme park'. The main hypothesis adopted in this study is that satisfaction may be of two types: (1) generic, which relates to general 'push' needs such as those for relaxation, and (2) site specific, which relate to destination attraction features and 'pull' determinants. This thesis argues that the satisfaction of generic motives such as the requirement for relaxation and escape is contingent upon the ability of the attraction to meet the visit motives specific to the attraction. For example, a need for escape would not be met if a theme park visitor found the rides uninspiring, the portrayal of fantasy unconvincing and the food poor. Furthermore, researchers such as Foster (1999) suggest that some destination attributes, while considered important by the tourists, rarely act as an incentive to choose a specific destination, but the absence of these attributes can be a powerful deterrent. Some of the attributes, such as 'accessible toilets' and 'a place to rest', are considered as convenience factors in this thesis. This thesis attempts to understand the relationship of push, pull and convenience factors to the visitors' overall satisfaction. Also, this thesis tries to understand the role of socio-demographic variables in determining overall satisfaction. This thesis also includes a longitudinal study that allows the research to capture the effect of changes to visitors. For example, Janfusun has newly installed an artificial beach and wave feature that serves the social needs of its visitors. This thesis also examines the importance of repeat visitation in determining visitors' motivations and experiences. For example, it was found that visitors with high repeat visits are more aware of the 'new rides' than the first time visitors. Finally the last chapter attempts to answer two key questions, (a) why are the findings of importance to both conceptual literature and management practice, and (b) what might future researchers learn from this thesis. The objectives of this thesis are thus summarised as to: 1. Conduct a longitudinal study in Janfusun. 2. Identify visitors' pre-visit behaviour, which is associated with generic motives and push factors. 3. Identify visitors' during-visit behaviour, which is associated with site-specific features and pull factors. 4. Identify post-visit behaviour, which is associated with satisfaction and loyalty. 5. Identify the causal relationships between pre, during and post visit behaviours and conceptualise a model. 6. Identify the role of convenience factors...|$|E
