5|$|In some cases, yes, I {{think it}} has in terms {{of some of the}} stuff they did in the Middle East {{supporting}} the pro-democracy demonstrators. But a lot of bad things too, unnecessarily harassing people – I would class that as a bad thing. DDOSing the CIA website, stealing customer data and posting it online just for shits and giggles is not <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Penny (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting), Amy (Mayim Bialik) and Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) go for {{afternoon}} tea at a tea parlor {{in an attempt}} to feel more like adults. Once they arrive, they see that only mothers and their children are there; they decide to hit the lobby bar instead. They discuss how they do not feel grown up and how being an adult is not necessarily <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} to the other worlds of the Hainish universe, the relationship between Athshe and the League of Worlds is portrayed as ambiguous. Whereas with planets such as Gethen in The Left Hand of Darkness the integration with the Hainish planets is seen as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> Athshe is seen as changed for the worse both by the loggers and by being taught to kill their own species. The League eventually decides to isolate Athshe and limit all contact with it, a decision shown to have ambiguous overtones.|$|E

5|$|Joe Law of GameFocus {{criticized the}} Rage Gage system, stating {{that it had}} been done better in other games. However he cited the game's overall length <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> as he felt the game had no replay value. Nick Valentino of GameZone praised the game, calling it the best RPG {{to make use of the}} Dragon Ball label, and the game was the perfect {{introduction}} into the franchise. Mike Moehnke of RPGamer cited the games as not being perfect, but was superior to the Super Famicom game Legend of the Super Saiyan. Kat Bailey of 1UP.com felt the game was made with children in mind, stating that the vibrant colors and the fast-paced gameplay would keep kids interested in the game.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of those}} who have {{attempted}} to find an escape from the impulse to power have resorted to forms of quietism or pacifism. One major proponent of such approaches was the philosopher Laozi. From Russell's perspective, such views are incoherent, since they only deny themselves coercive power, but retain an interest in persuading others to their cause; and persuasion is a form of power, for Russell. Moreover, he argues that the love of power can actually be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> For instance, if one feels a certain duty towards their neighbours, they may attempt to attain power to help those neighbours (Russell 1938:215–216). In sum, the focus of any policy should not be on a ban on kinds of power, but rather, on certain kinds of use of power (Russell 1938:221).|$|E
5|$|The combat was {{generally}} well-received, with some reviewers noting {{that it is}} mostly unchanged from the original Knights of the Old Republic. GameSpot compared the combat from the first Knights of the Old Republic to the second, {{saying that it is}}n't well-balanced in both; however, the reviewer wrote that it helps the combat remain spontaneous. GameZone said that the combat is not changed from the first Knights of the Old Republic to the second, but that this is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> since the combat in the original was enjoyable. IGN praised the game's AI, saying that it is easy to control the main character alone without controlling the party members. GameSpy's reviewer, on the other hand, said that he encountered problems with the combat AI that were not present in the original Knights of the Old Republic.|$|E

5|$|While Homer {{longs for}} his wife, Moe comes by the Simpsons' house to declare his {{interest}} in Marge, who turns him down. When Homer comes into the house with flowers he picked for Marge, Moe sees him and jumps out the window. Standing before her in rags, Homer professes his total and utter dependency on Marge, and she tells him {{that that is not}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> but Homer then makes his winning argument: he loves her, he needs her to love him, and can not afford to ever lose her trust again or he will end up dead. Marge is won over and allows Homer to return to the house. The family is glad that he has returned, although Moe is less than thrilled.|$|E
5|$|The second {{considered}} {{application is}} animal agriculture. Cochrane argues that animals possess concrete rights {{not to be}} made to suffer or be killed while being raised for food. The book argues that factory farming inflicts suffering upon the animals used, and this suffering outweighs the cost to humans of not using the method. Killing animals for their flesh is also challenged, and objections that this infringes on human liberty, that many humans would lose their jobs and that flesh-consumption is necessary for human health are all considered and rejected. Milk and egg production may be permissible under certain circumstances, provided animals are not killed or made to suffer, and, equally, animal corpses could be used provided that the animals have died naturally. Three counter arguments are considered. First, Cochrane contends that the fact farmed animals would not exist {{were it not for the}} human desire for their flesh is irrelevant: it is not clear that creating animals is good for them, and, even if it is, doing <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> for an animal will not justify subsequently harming them, just as it would not in a human case. Second, Cochrane considers the fact that some animals are killed by nonhuman predators. He rejects Regan's claim that intervention is not required when killers are not moral agents and the consequentialist claim that interference will do more harm than good, instead suggesting that nonhuman predators need to kill to survive, but humans do not. Third, he considers the fact that animals are killed in the harvesting process. These animals, he suggests, are killed for human survival, but as fewer are killed than would be killed were humans eating meat, they do not possess a concrete right to life. Despite this, political communities must take steps to ensure that fewer animals are killed in harvest.|$|E

25|$|Some {{argue that}} it is {{impossible}} to do the calculation that utilitarianism requires because consequences are inherently unknowable. Daniel Dennett describes this as the Three Mile Island effect.

He suggests that it would have been <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> if plant operators learned lessons that prevented future serious incidents.|$|E
