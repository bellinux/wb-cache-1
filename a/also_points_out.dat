5|$|Kelsey Munro {{reviewed}} {{the book in}} the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, suggesting that it is pessimistic and does not present any false hope. But he says pessimism {{is not the same}} thing as fatalism, and Hamilton believes there is still an urgent need for government intervention to avoid worst-case scenarios by reducing emissions. Munro <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> that some eminent climate scientists, like Princeton University's Michael Oppenheimer, remain optimistic that humanity will act before it is too late.|$|E
5|$|Ram Shankar Bhattacharya, an Indologist, dates the Pune {{version of}} a {{manuscript}} of the text to about the 13th or 14th century CE, and notes that {{this version of the}} Yoga Yajnavalkya quotes verses from Hatha Yoga texts. He <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> that Gargi is mentioned as the wife of Yajnavalkya in the manuscript. However, no other text affirms that Gargi was the wife of Yajnavalkya; rather, Maitreyi and Katyayani are listed as his two wives, leading to the theory that the Pune manuscript is a corrupted and more modern edition of the original text.|$|E
5|$|Parmelly {{is blamed}} for the murders. The agents start to leave Florida, but Mulder soon pulls over. He remains frustrated, since Parmelly was on-duty during only one murder, and {{was not one of}} the three men who knew Perry Simon's {{confidential}} identity. He <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> inconsistencies in the actions of Parmelly and Roque, who was also assumed {{to be part of the}} plot. Mulder believes that Parmelly was not responsible for the deaths, and that Neech had indeed been reincarnated to exact his revenge. However, Scully convinces Mulder that the case is over, and that they should return home. Just then, Brodeur passes them in his car. Looking in his rear view mirror, he sees Neech, who attacks Brodeur and causes his car to crash into a tree, claiming his last victim.|$|E

5|$|The film's {{structure}} {{influenced the}} biographical films Lawrence of Arabia and —which {{begin with the}} subject's death and show their life in flashbacks—as well as Welles's thriller Mr. Arkadin. Rosenbaum sees similarities in the film's plot to Mr. Arkadin, {{as well as the}} theme of nostalgia for loss of innocence throughout Welles's career, beginning with Citizen Kane and including The Magnificent Ambersons, Mr. Arkadin and Chimes at Midnight. Rosenbaum <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> how the film influenced Warren Beatty's Reds. The film depicts the life of Jack Reed through the eyes of Louise Bryant, much as Kane's life is seen through the eyes of Thompson and the people who he interviews. Rosenbaum also compared the romantic montage between Reed and Bryant with the breakfast table montage in Citizen Kane.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately for Brian, {{when his}} novel is released, it is universally panned by {{literary}} critics {{and does not}} sell a single copy. Brian laments that he sacrificed his core beliefs for nothing, but Lois intervenes because he helped ban cannabis (and she <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> how Stewie got to build a nice fort from all of Brian's unsold books). A distraught Quagmire arrives at the household and informs Peter that he is still looking for James and offers a reward of $50. Peter nonchalantly takes the reward, admits that he killed him and slams his door before Quagmire {{has a chance to}} react.|$|E
5|$|Although Germanus's {{name is not}} Anglo-Saxon, Byrhtferth, a {{contemporary}} who wrote the Vita Oswaldi, which contains much information on Germanus, states {{that he was a}} native of Winchester. Germanus accompanied Oscytel, the Archbishop of York, and Oswald of Worcester, on their trip to Rome in about 957, purportedly to collect Oscytel's pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority. This journey, however, has been challenged by the historian Donald Bullough, who argues that no previous archbishops of York had collected their palliums in person. He <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> that this story is only related in the Chronicon Abbatiae Rameseiensis, the chronicle of the Ramsey Abbey. According to the Ramsey story, Oscytel and Oswald returned to England, but Germanus remained on the continent and became a monk at Fleury Abbey in France. Another story has Oswald journeying to Fleury on his own, with Germanus arriving at Fleury after Oswald had been resident at Fleury {{for a number of years}} prior to 958.|$|E

5|$|Michael and Dwight {{meet with}} Jan, {{who is now}} a fairly {{successful}} office manager for a hospital and single mother. After Jan gives Michael a brutal description of why their relationship failed and he watches her play with her daughter Astrid, Michael reveals that he has herpes. He meets with Helene, Pam's mother, who is playing with CeCe at a playground; after an awkward conversation in which she <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> his skewed memory, he insults her and walks off. He meets with Carol while she is conducting an open house. Carol attempts to be polite, but then abruptly points out his faults too. Finally, Michael calls Holly one last time, only to get her voicemail. He leaves her a heartfelt message that what she said hurt him and that when he saw all his other exes, he had not been happy to see any of them, but when he talked to her, he was happy. He says that does not understand why she wants to downplay what they had, but he remembers their relationship perfectly and considers it special. Before hanging up, he awkwardly adds that she should be tested for herpes.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, other historians like Masahiro Yamamoto {{have argued}} that the death {{sentence}} was too severe a penalty for Matsui's crime of mere negligence in failing to stop the massacre. The journalist Richard Minear <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> that Matsui's penalty was disproportionately severe compared to the other convicted defendants. Kuniaki Koiso was found guilty on four counts and Mamoru Shigemitsu was found guilty on five counts, in both cases including one count of negligence, and both were given prison sentences. Matsui, by contrast, was found guilty of only one count of negligence but was sentenced to death. The historian Tokushi Kasahara argues that the prosecution at the IMTFE did not attempt seriously to investigate all those {{who were involved in the}} Nanking Massacre, and instead just decided to make Matsui the sole scapegoat for the whole atrocity.|$|E
5|$|PTV {{becomes a}} huge success, and Brian and Stewie, {{impressed}} by the hits, join in to help Peter expand his television programming, as well as performing their own show Cheeky Bastard sitcom on PTV. Lois is furious about everyone's lust for perverted TV, as she is concerned {{over the issue of}} how children will be influenced by his programming (in the episode's DVD release, Peter and Cleveland, in a parody of Jackass, defecate on top of Lois' car). Brian then tells Lois that parents and legal guardians are the ones who should take full responsibility for what kids watch on TV and <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> that there are much worse influences besides TV. Regardless of that, Lois calls the FCC to have PTV shut down. This prompts Peter, Brian, and Stewie to perform an elaborate musical number about how insane the FCC's regulations are. Despite being impressed with the song, the arriving FCC representatives shut down PTV. When Peter tells the FCC representatives that while they can censor television they can't stop people from being who they are or how they live their lives, they decide to take on the challenge.|$|E

5|$|The second plot of {{the episode}} {{revolves}} around Jerry; when he prepares {{to go to the}} laundromat, Kramer asks him to take his laundry with him. Jerry agrees after some reluctance, insisting that their clothes remain segregated. After retrieving the laundry the following day and returning Kramer's portion, Jerry remembers that he had hidden a large sum of money in his laundry bag, but is unable to find it. The owner of the laundromat (John Capodice), tells him that he did not see the money, but <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> that he is not responsible for valuables. Kramer and Jerry both assume Vic stole the money and Kramer comes {{up with a plan to}} put cement mix in one of Vic's washing machines as revenge. Once they have acted out the plan, Kramer discovers that he had the money all along; and it turns out to be just enough to cover the damage to the washing machine.|$|E
5|$|Public {{sentiment}} {{was against}} Rowan {{in the matter}} of his duel with Chambers. Soon after the duel, friends of Chambers formed a posse and rode toward Rowan's house. Rowan concocted a ruse whereby he dressed a family slave in his coat and hat and sent him riding from the house on horseback. The posse was fooled into thinking the slave was Rowan and gave chase, but the slave escaped and Rowan's life was spared as well. Days later, the owner of the land where the duel had taken place swore out a warrant for Rowan's arrest for murder. Some accounts hold that, as Commonwealth's Attorney, Rowan's friend Felix Grundy would have been responsible for prosecuting the case against Rowan and that Grundy resigned the position to avoid prosecuting his friend. Grundy's biographer, John Roderick Heller, admits that this was possible, although no evidence exists to confirm it. Heller <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> that Grundy was Commonwealth's Attorney not in Nelson County (the location of Bardstown), but in neighboring Washington County at the time. Joseph Hamilton Daveiss and Colonel William Allen served as counsel for Rowan. The judge opined that there was insufficient evidence to send the case to a grand jury, and Rowan was released.|$|E

25|$|Tell <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> the {{significance}} of the octagon surrounding the Latin cross on the disc. According to him, octagon had special importance {{in the context of the}} Carolingian kingdom of Charlemagne the Great. Specifically, the Carolingian Octagon chapel in Aachen was commissioned even before Charlemagne became the first Holy Roman Emperor. Thus, the octagonal shape of the disc seems to indicate its historical connection with the Holy Roman Empire.|$|E
25|$|A {{study in}} wine {{production}} and consumption has shown that tannins, {{in the form of}} proanthocyanidins, have a beneficial effect on vascular health. The study showed that tannins suppressed production of the peptide responsible for hardening arteries. To support their findings, the study <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> that wines from the regions of southwest France and Sardinia are particularly rich in proanthocyanidins, and that these regions also produce populations with longer life spans.|$|E

He <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> that the main themes in the paintings and other artifacts (powerful beasts, risky hunting scenes and the over-sexual representation of women) are to be expected in the fantasies of adolescent males during the Upper Paleolithic.|$|E
25|$|Dobzhansky {{continues}} {{the theme of}} continuity between the laboratory and nature in chapter 4, showing that variations in the structure, arrangement and number of chromosomes occur in both the laboratory and nature. He shows that chromosomal translocation, a rearrangement of parts in chromosomes, accounts for racial differences in Datura stramonium (jimson-weed). Chromosomal inversion, a reversal of a segment, {{is the basis for}} differentiation in Drosophila. He <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> that these effects demonstrate that the chromosome parts are interdependent.|$|E
25|$|MacDonald is {{best known}} for his trilogy that {{analyzes}} Judaism and Jewish culture from the perspective of evolutionary psychology, comprising A People That Shall Dwell Alone (1994), Separation and Its Discontents (1998), and The Culture of Critique (1998). He proposes that Judaism is a group evolutionary strategy to enhance the ability of Jews to out-compete non-Jews for resources. Using the term Jewish ethnocentrism, he argues that Judaism fosters in Jews a series of marked genetic traits, including above-average verbal intelligence and a strong tendency toward collectivist behavior, as manifested in a series of influential intellectual movements. MacDonald repeatedly emphasizes that he does not argue that all Jews in all circumstances display the traits he identifies; for example, his Understanding Jewish Influence argues that neoconservatism is a Jewish intellectual movement, while MacDonald <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> that American Jews generally favor the Democratic Party, not Republicans or conservatives and he <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> that in the 2000 US Presidential Election about 80% of the Jewish vote went to United States Vice President Al Gore, who was campaigning against George W. Bush, whose campaign MacDonald claims was heavily staffed with and influenced by neoconservatives.|$|E
