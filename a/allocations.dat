40|$|Abstract — We {{study the}} {{performance}} of generalized cµ-rule implementation in OFDMA systems, namely bit-based subcarrier <b>allocation</b> and packet-based subchannel <b>allocation.</b> While cµ-rule is asymptotically optimum in continuous-time server <b>allocation,</b> {{it needs to be}} adjusted when applied to discrete-time server <b>allocation</b> in OFDMA systems. Bit-based <b>allocation</b> considers the <b>allocation</b> through bit-based connectivity. Resource wastage is prevented by greedy reassignment in low traffic regime. Packetbased <b>allocation</b> adopts cµ-rule and allocates the servers through multiple-packet rates. The <b>allocation</b> is ordered from the server with lowest connectivity to the server with highest connectivity. Simulation results show that bit-based <b>allocation</b> outperforms packet-based <b>allocation</b> in queue length minimization for small number of users. With increasing number of users, the performance difference becomes smaller and at the certain limit, the packet-based <b>allocation</b> performs better. Furthermore, the packet-based <b>allocation</b> might be better in practical realization due to the lower complexity. I...|$|R
5|$|In {{respect of}} the 2009 {{amendments}} to the NZ ETS, intensity-based allocation was favoured over <b>allocations</b> based on historical emissions by business groups, and representatives of large emitters, by Fonterra and by Federated Farmers.

5|$|Nevertheless, {{there are}} many {{scenarios}} where customized allocators are desirable. Some {{of the most common}} reasons for writing custom allocators include improving performance of <b>allocations</b> by using memory pools, and encapsulating access to different types of memory, like shared memory or garbage-collected memory. In particular, programs with many frequent <b>allocations</b> of small amounts of memory may benefit greatly from specialized allocators, both in terms of running time and memory footprint.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundTypically, little {{consideration}} {{is given to}} the <b>allocation</b> of indirect costs (overheads and capital) to hospital services, compared to the <b>allocation</b> of direct costs. Weighted service <b>allocation</b> is believed to provide the most accurate indirect cost estimation, but the method is time consuming. ObjectiveTo determine whether hourly rate, inpatient day, and marginal mark-up <b>allocation</b> are reliable alternatives for weighted service <b>allocation.</b> MethodsThe cost approaches were compared independently for appendectomy, hip replacement, cataract, and stroke in representative general hospitals in The Netherlands for 2005. ResultsHourly rate <b>allocation</b> and inpatient day <b>allocation</b> produce estimates that are not significantly different from weighted service <b>allocation.</b> ConclusionsHourly rate <b>allocation</b> may be a strong alternative to weighted service <b>allocation</b> for hospital services with a relatively short inpatient stay. The use of inpatient day <b>allocation</b> would likely most closely reflect the indirect cost estimates obtained by the weighted service method...|$|R

40|$|Multiuser Orthogonal {{frequency}} division multiplexing (MU-OFDM) {{is one of}} the promising techniques for future cellular and wireless networks for achieving high downlink capacities. The objective of the next generation cellular and wireless networks, which are based on (MU-OFDM) is to increase the network efficiency by maximizing the total throughput of the system and minimizing the overall transmit power for a given quality of service (QOS). The sum capacity of MU-OFDM is maximized when each subchannel is assigned to the user with the best channel-tonoise ratio for that subchannel. Ever increasing demand for high throughput, low delay and low Outage probability can be met by using Adaptive Resource <b>Allocation</b> in OFDM Technology. In optimal resource <b>allocation</b> algorithms the subcarrier and power <b>allocation</b> should be done simultaneously but it is computationally complex. In order to reduce the complexity of resource <b>allocation</b> algorithms the subcarrier and power <b>allocation</b> is done separately and this is called sub-optimal subcarrier <b>allocation</b> and sub-optimal power <b>allocation.</b> Z. Shen et al. in [9] has given both suboptimal subcarrier <b>allocation</b> and sub-optimal power <b>allocation</b> algorithms. In this paper we have proposed two methods of subcarrier <b>allocation</b> based on subcarrier <b>allocation</b> method in [9], and compared them with subcarrier <b>allocation</b> algorithm of [9]. Comparison is made between subcarrier <b>allocation</b> algorithms only by considering equal power distribution among subcarriers instead of sub-optimal power <b>allocation</b> scheme given in [9].

30|$|The {{resource}} <b>allocation</b> {{problem in}} (10) {{is a mixed}} combinatorial and nonconvex optimization problem. The combinatorial nature comes from the PRB <b>allocation</b> constraints C 1 and C 2. The nonconvexity feature {{is caused by the}} fractional form of the objective function. Besides, the variables are mixed integer. Hence, the problem is very difficult to solve. Therefore, we decouple the resource <b>allocation</b> problem into two sub-problems: PRB (bandwidth) <b>allocation</b> for a given power <b>allocation</b> and power <b>allocation</b> for a given PRB <b>allocation.</b>|$|R

Three Resource <b>Allocation</b> methods are analyzed including a static resource <b>allocation</b> method, a semidynamic resource <b>allocation</b> method, and a dynamic resource <b>allocation</b> method. The last methodology used in this thesis develops a resource <b>allocation</b> method intended to display complex behavior. A Base Case manufacturing simulation is developed to represent a static resource <b>allocation</b> system. A Theory of Constraints manufacturing model using the Theory of Constraints process represents a semi-dynamic resource <b>allocation</b> system. A Complex Adaptive System manufacturing model using autonomous agents represents a dynamic resource <b>allocation</b> system. The systems were analyzed at multiple stress levels for system to system performance, {{as well as for}} complex behavior. Dynamic resource <b>allocation</b> outperformed the semi-dynamic <b>allocation</b> and static <b>allocation</b> systems unilaterally. Some complex behavior was displayed for elements of some models, but as a whole, a trend of increasing complexity did not emerge as the models were analyzed from the Base Case, to Theory of Constraints, to the Complex Adaptive System...|$|R
