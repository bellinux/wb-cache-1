60|$|Huddled in her corner sat Cecile, {{listening}} {{until his}} steps had died {{away on the}} stairs. Then she cast herself prone upon the settle, and {{in a frenzy of}} sobs and tears she vented some of the rage <b>and</b> <b>shame</b> <b>that</b> were distracting her.|$|E

60|$|Indeed, {{his glory}} is veiled, and cannot be seen but as {{discovered}} by the Father (Matt 11:27). It is veiled with flesh, with meanness of descent from the flesh, and with that ignominy <b>and</b> <b>shame</b> <b>that</b> attended him in the flesh; but they that can, in God's light, see through these things, they shall see glory in him; yea, such glory as will draw and pull their hearts unto him.|$|E
60|$|It {{was almost}} in tears, so great was their heart-sickness <b>and</b> <b>shame,</b> <b>that</b> the {{brothers}} walked {{the remainder of}} the way to Joshua's dwelling. In the evening they set out to meet Rosa, bringing her to the village in a fly; and when she had come into the house, and was sitting down with them, they almost forgot their secret anxiety in contemplating her, who knew nothing about it.|$|E

60|$|But Mr. Meredith did no combing down or {{pitching}} into. He {{sat down}} and gathered his small culprits close to him and talked a little to them, tenderly and wisely.

60|$|Lady Selina {{gave him}} the first check. On the morning on which Lord Kilcullen made his offer, she paid her father a solemn visit in his book-room, and told him exactly what she had before told her mother; assured him that Fanny could not be induced, at any rate at present, to receive her cousin as her lover; whispered to him, with unfeigned sorrow <b>and</b> <b>shame,</b> <b>that</b> Fanny was still {{madly in love with}} Lord Ballindine; and begged him to induce her brother to {{postpone}} his offer, at any rate for some months.|$|E
6000|$|But Sir Lamorack did {{not fall}} with his steed; for he voided his saddle with a very {{wonderful}} agility and dexterity, so that he himself kept his feet, although his horse fell as aforesaid. Then he was filled with great rage <b>and</b> <b>shame</b> <b>that</b> {{he had been so}} overthrown before all those who looked upon him; wherefore he immediately drew his sword and cried out aloud: [...] "Come down, Sir Knight, and do battle with me afoot, for though my horse hath failed me because of his weariness, yet you shall find that my body shall not so fail me." ...|$|E

She remembered the words of it, how {{it was to be}} when she had gotten a jo, and that that would be for good and evil. “Will I have gotten my jo now?” she thought with a secret rapture.|$|E
6000|$|It {{is easy to}} say, [...] "I will forget," [...] {{but perhaps}} the hardest task given us is to lock up a natural yearning of the heart, and turn a deaf ear to its plaint, for captive and jailer must inhabit the same small cell. Sylvia was proud, with that pride which is both {{sensitive}} and courageous, which can not only suffer but wring strength from suffering. While she struggled with a grief <b>and</b> <b>shame</b> <b>that</b> aged her with their pain, she asked no help, made no complaint; but when the forbidden passion stretched its arms to her, she thrust it back and turned to pleasure for oblivion.|$|E

50|$|The {{major themes}} in the poems of Mah are his {{experience}} as a doctor and his life abroad in Japan and especially America. The pieces marked by his medical experiences express profound compassion and hope for the ability of love to negate pain. His works dealing with life in foreign countries tend to be more complex in tone; in them he writes of his recollections of his life in Korea and the various conflicting feelings: intense patriotism, love and anger toward his fellow Koreans, <b>and</b> <b>shames</b> <b>that</b> stem from his reflections on his homeland. Both themes ultimately inspire the same compassion for humanity, whether for the suffering or for the uprooted, and attain a universality that has become Ma’s trademark.|$|R
60|$|He then {{proceeded}} to construct an extemporary fireplace of loose stones, and to put together chips and shavings for the fire,--in which work little Mara eagerly assisted; but the fire was crackling and burning cheerily long before Sally appeared with her clams, and so the Captain, {{with a pile of}} hemlock boughs by his side, sat on a stone feeding the fire leisurely from time to time with crackling boughs. Now was the time for Mara to make her inquiries; her heart beat, she knew not why, for she was full of those little timidities <b>and</b> <b>shames</b> <b>that</b> so often embarrass children in their attempts to get at the meanings of things in this great world, where they are such ignorant spectators.|$|R

He said such cruel things I could not bear it, and cried out that I would come to you, for I was quite wild with terror, grief, <b>and</b> <b>shame,</b> <b>that</b> seemed like oil to fire.

60|$|In short, {{unpleasant}} as was my predicament, at best, I saw much {{reason to}} congratulate myself that I {{was on the}} losing side rather than the triumphant one. If, heretofore, I had been none of the warmest of partisans I began now, at this season of peril and adversity, to be pretty acutely sensible with which party my predilections lay; nor was it without something like regret <b>and</b> <b>shame</b> <b>that,</b> according to a reasonable calculation of chances, I saw my own prospect of retaining office {{to be better than}} those of my democratic brethren.

Though she had felt herself {{compelled}} to turn informant against her lover, and by implication against Tetchen, her lover's accomplice, nevertheless she despised herself for what she was doing. She {{did not expect to}} soften her aunt by her conduct, or in any way to mitigate the rigour of her own sufferings. Her clandestine meetings with Ludovic had brought with them so much of pain <b>and</b> <b>shame,</b> <b>that</b> she had resolved almost by instinct to avoid another.

But however I may have been misled, my regret is most sincere for having spread such a rumour; {{and no one can}} be more gratified than I that the report, however I have been induced to credit and give it currency, is a false one, and that Dr. Grahame is still the living pastor of Aberfoil, for the delight and instruction of his brother antiquaries.] ...|$|E

Lord Ivinghoe, a young Guardsman, had shown himself enough disposed to flirt with the pretty little Greek to make the prudent very glad that her home was on the Italian mountains.|$|E
