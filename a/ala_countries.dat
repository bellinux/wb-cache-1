40|$|Often, {{immigration}} {{debates are}} conducted under {{the presumption that}} immigration policies must be justifiable {{only to those who}} already live in the respective <b>country.</b> <b>Alas,</b> reflection on the justifiability of immigration policies to those excluded becomes ever more important in a politically and economically increasingly interconnected world. This study explores two approaches to the normative reflection on immigration at some depth, namely, the idea that restrictive immigration policies are problematic because they are hampering the development of human capabilities, as well as the idea that such policies are problematic because they are at odds with the fact that our planet belongs to humanity collectively. On both of these proposals, less restrictive immigration policies are not merely demanded as one possible way of aiding the poor, but would be required as such. Both of these approaches can be treated within the same framework, the grounds-of-justice framework, which allows us to focus on the idea that states must also be justified to those who do not belong to them. Central to the proposal about immigration that can be made within this approach are ideas of over- and under-use of commonly owned resources and spaces. ...|$|R

He had had a violent and cruel mother, and had, after her death, been bred up by evil-minded courtiers, who absolutely taught him cruel and dissolute amusements in order to prevent him from attending to state affairs. For a time, the exhortations of the good and fearless patriarch, and the influence of his gentle wife Anastasia, had prevailed, and with great vigor and strong principle he had shaken off all the evil habits of his boyhood, and begun, as it seemed, an admirable reign.|$|R

40|$| governments. All {{too often}} formalized, complex {{experimentation}} {{that would normally}} be undertaken under station conditions has just been transferred to village situations. Under such conditions the results have rarely been satisfactory. NGO involvement The realization that greater participation by the producer at all stages {{is the key to}} successful development partly explains the increasing role played by non-government organizations (NGOs) in agricultural development. The term NGO describes a wide range of organizations that differ in ideologies, scale of operation and objectives. Many of the large international development NGOs, such as Action Aid, Christian Aid and Oxfam, are capable of mobilizing considerable resources. As such they can, and do, implement successful agricultural and rural development programmes in many ACP countries. The number of specialized NGOs is also increasing; many are ideologically orientated or address specific issues: women in development, intermediate technologies and agroforestry for example. At {{the other end of the}} scale there are numerous small, national NGOs working effectively with local communities. The Swaziland Farmers Foundation (SFF) is just one example of many that has successfully mobilized local and international funds which, under its supervision, it has channeled through local communities. As with most NGOs the SFF responds to the requests of the community - mostly concerning small-scale irrigation and watershed management - who are expected to contribute not just labour but cash and inputs as well. NGOs have succeeded in achieving a far greater level of community participation in their programmes compared with those run by government organizations. As a result, donor aid is increasingly being channeled through NGOs, with the emphasis on structural adjustment and increasing donor disenchantment with the performance of the public sector. There is, however, growing concern as more funds are being passed through NGOs. Evidence is emerging of less than scrupulous NGOs being established (in many countries there are few restrictions to establishing a NGO) to exploit such funding. A comprehensive review which examines the role of NGOs has recently been undertaken by the Overseas Development Institute (see box). If sustainable development is to be achieved in the longer-term, then greater responsibility for the delivery of inputs and advisory services must fall increasingly upon the producers themselves. National institutions will need to take on a more strategic role. The provision of core services, such as diagnostic facilities, research and the provision of technical expertise will largely remain the mandate of the public sector, as will regulatory controls, public health and the use of macro-economic mechanisms to support national industries. However, in most ACP countries, farmers' organizations have not yet developed to the stage where they can become self-sufficient and government institutions are becoming increasingly ineffective in operating at farm level. Probably the most important development role that NGOs can play is to facilitate the transition of certain services away from the public sector to the private and communal sectors. This could be achieved through identifying local needs, screening for appropriate technology options, testing, disseminating and providing feedback, and lobbying governments on behalf of the rural poor, whilst at the same time promoting the development of appropriate producer organizations. Partners for development Indeed, the strengths and weaknesses of both NGOs and government services would indicate considerable compatibility between the two. In agricultural development, government strength lies with their specialized facilities, technical expertise and links with the wider scientific community; whereas NGOs are capable of taking a holistic approach based on participatory methods determine and address the actual needs farming communities. Government met oafs and programmes are largely inappropriate to small-scale producers, non-participatory approaches are common and poor coordination exits between various departments. Likewise, NGOs have limited capacity for research and weak links with the scientific community and may not be effective at micro-economic level. For instance local NGOs will for sometime, still have rely on the public sector for resources in such areas as training. Clearly, NGOs and government are potential partners - not adversaries - in development. <b>Alas,</b> in many <b>countries</b> the level of mistrust and suspicion between the two remains disappointingly high. If greater complementarily between the state sector and NGOs is to be achieved, then a number of largely institutional issues have to be addressed. A strategic shift in resource allocation between a country's varying sources of innovation (farmers, NGOs, government organizations, development projects and commercial sectors) may required. National agricultural institutions would move away from their traditional research-orientated programmes towards a coordinating role which stimulates the movement of ideas between the various elements of the development process. It is unlikely that any one NGO would possess the resources that are available to the state, and no NGO is likely to be accepted by others as either the representative of the rural poor or of other NGOs; therefore responsibility for any overall strategy for institutional collaboration in agricultural development will fall to the public sector. Donors can help to bring these changes about, but if NGOs and the public sector are to become effective partners in stimulating agricultural development, both will need to show flexibility and commitment. Extension services established since independence have generally failed to live up to expectations. Increases in agricultural production in ACP countries have been achieved largely through the expansion of the cultivated land area and increased [...] ...|$|R
