5|$|Although he {{is mainly}} {{associated}} with the Royal Ballet, MacMillan frequently considered himself <b>an</b> <b>outsider</b> there and felt driven {{to work with other}} companies throughout his career as choreographer. His creations for the Stuttgart Ballet and the Deutsche Opera ballet include some of his most frequently revived works.|$|E
5|$|Harry Connick, Jr. as Dean McCoppin, a beatnik {{artist and}} junkyard owner. Bird felt it {{appropriate}} {{to make the}} character {{a member of the}} beat generation, as they were viewed as mildly threatening to small-town values during that time. <b>An</b> <b>outsider</b> himself, he is among the first to recognize the Giant as no threat.|$|E

5|$|As {{a working-class}} woman, Anning was <b>an</b> <b>outsider</b> to the {{scientific}} community. At the time in Britain women {{were not allowed to}} vote, hold public office, or attend university. The newly formed, but increasingly influential Geological Society of London did not allow women to become members, or even to attend meetings as guests. The only occupations generally open to working-class women were farm labour, domestic service, and work in the newly opening factories.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{around the}} time of U2's second, spiritually charged album, October, a rift was created in the band between Clayton and McGuinness, and the three other band members. Bono, The Edge, and Mullen had joined a Christian group, and were {{questioning}} the compatibility of rock music with their spirituality. However, Clayton, with his more ambiguous religious views, was less concerned, and so was more of <b>an</b> <b>outsider.</b>|$|E
5|$|In his {{writings}} Henson {{referred to his}} two regrets in life. The first {{was that he had}} not been at a public school, a fact to which he ascribed his lifelong feeling of being <b>an</b> <b>outsider.</b> The second regret was {{that he and his wife}} had been unable to have children. They unofficially adopted a succession of poor boys and paid for their education. At least one of them became a priest and was ordained by Henson.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Takechi {{turned from the}} stage to the cinema. Though the {{mainstream}} film industry considered Takechi an amateur and <b>an</b> <b>outsider,</b> {{he would continue to}} produce ground-breaking films sporadically {{for the rest of his}} life. Some of the innovations and trends in Japanese erotic cinema which Takechi's films pioneered include big-budgets and releases, literary and artistic aspirations, fogging, political themes, and theatrical hardcore.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{attempts}} to prove {{life in an}} office is dangerous after Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) berates him {{about the dangers of}} the warehouse. The attempts lead him to the roof of the building, where he tries to show that depression caused by an office can lead to desperate circumstances. Meanwhile, gambling between the other employees of the office leads Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones) to discover that she is still <b>an</b> <b>outsider.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kyle is a third- then fourth-grade {{student who}} {{commonly}} has extraordinary experiences not typical of conventional small-town {{life in his}} fictional hometown of South Park, Colorado. Kyle is distinctive {{as one of the}} few Jewish children on the show, and because of this, he often feels like <b>an</b> <b>outsider</b> amongst the core group of characters. His portrayal in this role is often dealt with satirically, and has elicited both praise and criticism from Jewish viewers.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{notion of}} didactical {{engineering}} has influenced and characterized contemporary research in mathematics education in France {{to an important}} extent. In this paper, we address the following from an insider’s and <b>an</b> <b>outsider’s</b> perspective: (1) the way this notion is theoretically grounded, (2) the kinds of design research practices has it led to and is leading to, and (3) the way {{it relates to the}} design research paradigm. As a conclusion, we highlight similarities and differences between the two perspectives and recommend further discussions to the benefit of both didactical engineering from an insider’s and <b>an</b> <b>outsider’s</b> perspective...|$|R

5|$|Ælfhelm (died 1006) was the ealdorman of Northumbria, in {{practice}} southern Northumbria (the area around York), from about 994 until his death. An ealdorman (or earl) {{was a senior}} nobleman who governed a province—a shire or group of shires—on behalf of the king. Ælfhelm's powerful and wealthy family came from Mercia, a territory and former kingdom incorporating most of central England, and he achieved his position despite being <b>an</b> <b>outsider.</b> Ælfhelm first appears in charters as dux ("ealdorman") in about 994.|$|E
5|$|After the {{suggestion}} {{by the head}} of the Ministry of War Transport Cyril Hurcomb to conduct a joint local hearing chaired by <b>an</b> <b>outsider</b> was turned down by the Government due to much greater means being needed, the Government agreed that a public inquiry should be opened. A public inquiry into the plans was opened in December 1944, with the hearing lasting for three days. The Ministry of Town and Country Planning appointed Hurcomb as the chairman of the inquiry. The Electricity Commissioners appointed George Pepler and C.G. Morley New. The key opponents of the scheme were the City of Durham Preservation Society, chaired by Cyril Alington.|$|E
5|$|Already as a teenager, Sorabji {{took great}} {{interest}} in recent developments in art music—in the work of Schoenberg, Scriabin, Mahler and Debussy, among others—at {{a time when they}} received scant attention in the United Kingdom. This interest, along with his ethnicity, cemented his reputation as <b>an</b> <b>outsider.</b> He and his music had their detractors, but some musicians received his work positively: Frederick Delius, who heard a 1930 radio broadcast of Sorabji playing his own piece Le jardin parfumé: Poem for Piano Solo, sent a letter of admiration to Sorabji; the French–Swiss pianist Alfred Cortot expressed interest in performing Sorabji's piano concertos; and Alban Berg reportedly took an interest in Sorabji's music.|$|E

She finds herself very {{attracted}} to Ted, but maintains other relationships and reminds Ted repeatedly that he has rejected {{the idea of a}} workplace romance with her. She seems to be a bit of <b>an</b> <b>outsider</b> to the corporate culture. Often she demands that Ted consider the horrible ramifications of the company policies or activities. Her relationship with the scientists is strained by her rejection of the weird things they do in the name of science. Despite this, she finds herself increasingly looking at Veronica as a mentor as the series progresses.|$|E
5|$|Capturing one of {{the alien}} troops and {{conducting}} the interrogation reveals vague information about another type of alien called the Outsiders, artificially-created crystalline beings encountered aboard UFOs, that appear to serve as pilots and navigators. Dr. Vahlen then requests that XCOM capture <b>an</b> <b>Outsider</b> for study. Upon capturing {{one of the}}se, the examination reveals that the Outsiders' exotic crystalline structures behave {{in a manner similar}} to antennas, receiving a signal broadcast from a location buried underground on Earth. XCOM dispatches a team to investigate the signal; it is found to be coming from a base that the aliens have secretly established on Earth, where experiments are performed on abducted humans.|$|E
5|$|His parents imbue {{him with}} a strong moral compass during his {{formative}} years and warn him never to use his great strength in anger. However, during kindergarten, Danner nearly kills the school's bully in a one-sided fight after being assaulted by the child. This event brands him as <b>an</b> <b>outsider</b> {{in the eyes of}} the other children. Because they treat him with such abhorrence, his only solace comes in the form of unleashing his powers within the Colorado wilderness (uprooting trees, throwing huge boulders, leaping to the mountain tops, etc.). This stigma eventually wears off, though, and is forgotten by the time Danner enters high school.|$|E

5|$|Hope {{had been}} offered {{a leading role in}} Stanley Kubrick's war film, Full Metal Jacket, when he was offered the role of Gorman. He interacted with the other film's cast and crew, since both were shot near the Battersea Power Station in Nine Elms. The cast who played Colonial Marines (except latecomer Michael Biehn) {{underwent}} several weeks of training with United States Marines without Hope. Director James Cameron said that he wanted Hope separated so he would be seen as <b>an</b> <b>outsider,</b> complementing Gorman's onscreen inexperience.|$|E
5|$|In Retford, MacMillan was {{introduced}} to ballet by a local dance teacher, Jean Thomas. He had already had lessons in Scottish dancing in Dunfermline and tap dancing in Great Yarmouth, and he took to ballet immediately. In 1942 his mother died, which caused him acute and lasting distress. His father was a distant figure, and the boy's only close family relationship was with an elder sister. His obituarist in The Times suggests that {{the feeling of being}} <b>an</b> <b>outsider,</b> displayed in many of MacMillan's ballets, had its roots in his childhood.|$|E
5|$|Other critics even {{in later}} years insisted that the {{character}} of Shylock is that of <b>an</b> <b>outsider</b> separated from society, that the Jewish Shylock represented an older form of justice, meant to be supplanted by the Christian view, represented by Portia, who argued for the prevalence of mercy. Shylock, these critics maintained, must be removed {{in order to allow}} society to attain a Christian form of peace. Hazlitt's view, however, has remained as a valid countervailing concept of the play, one that does not arrive at easy conclusions or take sides readily.|$|E
50|$|Motivational reasons: Considering one’s {{own ability}} to {{understand}} their reasoning as being equivalent to <b>an</b> <b>outsider’s</b> is intimidating and {{a threat to the}} ego and sense of control.
