Grameen converts deposits made in villages into loans for the more needy in the villages (Yunus and Jolis 1998).|$|E

Ecotourism and agriculture, paired with greater investments in education, health, and private enterprise, are key elements of Madagascar's development strategy. Under Ravalomanana, these investments produced substantial economic growth, but the benefits were not evenly spread throughout the population, producing tensions over the increasing cost of living and declining living standards <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> and some segments of the middle class. , the economy has been weakened by the 2009–2013 political crisis, and quality of life remains low {{for the majority of the}} Malagasy population.|$|E

5|$|Robert Dudley was {{a pioneer}} of new industries; {{interested}} in many things from tapestries to mining, he was engaged in the first joint stock companies in English history. The Earl also concerned himself with relieving unemployment <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b> On a personal level, he gave to poor people, petitioners, and prisons on a daily basis. Due to his interests in trade and exploration, {{as well as his}} debts, his contacts with the London city fathers were intense. He was an enthusiastic investor in the Muscovy Company and the Merchant Adventurers. English relations with Morocco were also handled by Leicester. This he did in the manner of his private business affairs, underpinned by a patriotic and missionary zeal (commercially, these relations were loss-making). He took much interest in the careers of John Hawkins and Francis Drake from early on, and was a principal backer of Drake's circumnavigation of the world. Robert and Ambrose Dudley were also the principal patrons of Martin Frobisher's 1576 search for the Northwest Passage. Later Leicester acquired his own ship, the Galleon Leicester, which he employed in a luckless expedition under Edward Fenton, but also under Drake. As much as profit, English seapower was on his mind, and accordingly Leicester became a friend and leading supporter of Dom António, the exiled claimant to the Portuguese throne after 1580.|$|E
