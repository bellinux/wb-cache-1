5|$|The screenplay, {{written by}} Pintilie, {{was based on}} the Petru Dumitriu's novel Cronică de familie ("Family Chronicle"), and in {{particular}} on its chapter Salata ("The Salad"), which is often described as a stand-alone novella.

25|$|Probably Delacroix's best-known painting, Liberty Leading the People is <b>an</b> <b>unforgettable</b> {{image of}} Parisians, having taken up arms, marching forward {{under the banner}} of the tricolour {{representing}} liberty, equality, and fraternity. Although Delacroix was inspired by contemporary events to invoke this romantic image of the spirit of liberty, he seems to be trying to convey the will and character of the people, rather than glorifying the actual event, the 1830 revolution against Charles X, which did little other than bring a different king, Louis-Philippe, to power. The warriors lying dead in the foreground offer poignant counterpoint to the symbolic female figure, who is illuminated triumphantly, as if in a spotlight.|$|E

25|$|Today I have {{experienced}} my hardest combat. But {{at the same}} time it has been my most wonderful experience of comradeship in the air. We were eight Messerschmitts in the midst of an incredible whirling mass of enemy fighters. I flew my 109 for my life. I worked with every gram of energy and by the time we finished I was foaming at the mouth and utterly exhausted. Again and again we had enemy aircraft fighters on our tails. I was forced to dive three or four times, but I pulled up again and rushed back into the turmoil. Once I seemed to have no escape; I had flown my 109 to its limits, but a Spitfire still sat behind me. At the last moment Marseille shot it down, 50 metres from my 109. I dived and pulled up. Seconds later I saw a Spitfire behind Marseille. I took aim at the enemy— I have never aimed so carefully— and he dived down burning. At the end of the combat only Marseille and I were left in the dogfight. Each of us had three kills. At home we climbed out of out planes and were thoroughly exhausted. Marseille had bullet holes in his 109 and I had 11 hits in mine. We embraced each other, but were unable to speak. It was <b>an</b> <b>unforgettable</b> event.|$|E

500|$|<b>An</b> <b>Unforgettable</b> Summer ( [...] ; [...] ) is a 1994 drama film {{directed}} and produced by Lucian Pintilie. A Romanian-French co-production {{based on a}} chapter from a novel by Petru Dumitriu, it stars British actress Kristin Scott Thomas as the Hungarian-born aristocrat Marie-Thérèse Von Debretsy. Her marriage with Romanian Land Forces captain Petre Dumitriu brings her to Southern Dobruja (present-day northeastern Bulgaria), where they settle in 1925. There, she witnesses first-hand the violent clashes between, on one hand, the Greater Romanian administration, and, on the other, komitadji brigands of Macedonian origin and ethnic Bulgarian locals. The film shows her failed attempt to rescue Bulgarians held hostage by the Romanian soldiers, and who are destined for execution. <b>An</b> <b>Unforgettable</b> Summer also stars Claudiu Bleonţ as Captain Dumitriu and Marcel Iureş as Ipsilanti, a general whose unsuccessful attempt to seduce Von Debretsy and the resulting grudge he holds against the couple account for Dumitriu's reassignment.|$|E

500|$|Tronaru {{also points}} out that <b>An</b> <b>Unforgettable</b> Summer stays true to Pintilie's {{condemnation}} of Romanian administrative tradition, with officials displaying [...] "an inveterate stupidity", while J.
