40|$|We have {{investigated}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>waves</b> in a heterostructure {{with a layer}} embedded into a semiconductor providing <b>acoustic</b> <b>waves</b> localization near the layer and electron confinement inside the layer. For layer thicknesses smaller than wavelengths we have obtained and analyzed the dispersion relation for the localized waves. For electrons into the layer we have supposed that parallel transport is semiclassical, while perpendicular electron motion is quantized. For two-dimensional confined electrons interacting with the <b>acoustic</b> <b>waves</b> we have solved the Boltzmann equation in a parallel electric field. The solutions have been found for electron-phonon interaction via deformation potential. The dispersion relation for coupled charge density and <b>acoustic</b> <b>waves</b> has been analyzed.

Excitation of bulk <b>acoustic</b> <b>waves</b> by IDT in the devices on surface <b>acoustic</b> <b>waves</b> leads to the appearance of spurious signals. At the same time excitation of bulk <b>acoustic</b> <b>waves</b> with IDT from the surface of lithium niobate crystals allows creating high frequency acousto-optic deflectors, which makes possible to significantly simplify the technology of their production. Therefore, significant attention is paid to the task of excitation and distribution of bulk <b>acoustic</b> <b>waves</b> with IDT including recent times by the method of simulation of their excitation and distribution. The obtained theoretical results require experimental verification. This paper documents the visualization of acoustic beams excited with IDT from the XY-surface of lithium niobate crystals. The Bragg cells with LiNbO 3 crystals coated with IDT with a different period of electrodes were manufactured for the experimental research of excitation and distribution of bulk <b>acoustic</b> <b>waves.</b> Visualization results have shown that the <b>acoustic</b> <b>waves</b> excited with IDT distribute in both the Fresnel zone and the Fraunhofer zone. The length of these zones is caused by individual elementary emitters of which consists the IDT (by their size). At the same time the far zone for IDT is located at distances much greater than the actual size of the LiNbO 3 crystals. This peculiarity is not always taken into account when calculating diffraction.
