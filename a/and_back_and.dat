5|$|Both sexes reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{one year of}} age. The male mates with the female by swimming close to her with his head lowered and tail raised, continually whistling. If there {{is a group of}} males, they will chase the female in flight until only one drake is left. The female prepares for copulation, which takes place in the water, by lowering her body; the male then bobs his head up and down and mounts the female, taking the feathers {{on the back of her}} head in his mouth. After mating, he raises his head <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> whistles.|$|E

5|$|On January 9, 1980, Paul was {{attacked}} by an 18-year-old guest, Bradley Schlegel, {{at his home in}} Star Island. Schlegel stabbed Paul in the face, chest, arms, <b>and</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> Paul subsequently underwent plastic surgery to repair the wounds. Schlegel was charged with attempted murder, possession of a weapon, and attempted robbery. He initially contended that Paul had made aggressive sexual advances to him, prompting him to stab Paul in self-defense. Schlegel later pleaded no contest to a charge of aggravated battery.|$|E
5|$|The Sulu bleeding-heart {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from most terrestrial doves found on Tawi-Tawi. The emerald dove {{is most likely}} {{to be confused with the}} bleeding-heart, but the emerald dove is distinguished by a larger and whiter shoulder patch, a white supercilium, and dark chestnut underparts. Two bleeding-hearts are kept as pets and may escape on Tawi-Tawi; the Sulu bleeding-heart differs from the Luzon bleeding-heart by not having the Luzon bleeding-heart's purple nape <b>and</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> from the Mindanao bleeding-heart by lacking prominent gray wing-bars and an orange belly.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} co-written by Zack Whedon and supervising {{producer}} J. R. Orci, while producer Brad Anderson {{served as the}} director. The creation of the monster took the crew approximately eleven days – they took molds of guest actor Huff's head <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> created eight sets of dentures {{in order to create}} the special effect of transformation. To create the plane crash set, the crew spent over a week strategically placing around 15,000 pounds worth of plane parts.|$|E

5|$|The maxillary toothrows are {{parallel}} to each other. The molars are bunodont (with the cusps {{higher than the}} connecting crests) and brachyodont (low-crowned) and have the inter-cusp valleys on the labial (outer) sides closed by a cingulum (shelf). The valleys on the labial and lingual (inner) sides of the molars meet at the midlines. Each of the upper molars has three roots—unlike {{in most of the}} closest relatives of Pennatomys, there is no additional labial root on M1. The m1 has four roots—two large roots at the front <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> two smaller ones in the middle. There are three roots under m2, two at the front and one at the back, and two under m3, at the front and back. Upper toothrow length ranges from 5.6 to 6.7mm and lower toothrow length is 5.9 to 7.4mm.|$|E
5|$|The {{tiger shark}} (Galeocerdo cuvier) {{is known to}} prey on the bowmouth guitarfish. The ray is {{protected}} by the thorns on its head <b>and</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> it may ram perceived threats. Parasites documented from this species include the tapeworms Carpobothrium rhinei, Dollfusiella michiae, Nybelinia southwelli, Stoibocephalum arafurense, and Tylocephalum carnpanulatum, the leech Pontobdella macrothela, the trematode Melogonimus rhodanometra, the monogeneans Branchotenthes robinoverstreeti and Monocotyle ancylostomae, and the copepods Nesippus vespa, Pandarus cranchii, and P. smithii. There is a record of a bowmouth guitarfish being cleaned by bluestreak cleaner wrasses (Labroides dimidiatus).|$|E
5|$|The first event, {{the light}} plane, {{requires}} the player {{to follow a}} guide path of orbs, or to fly through rings of orbs, and then land on the runway. In the second event, skydiving, the player jumps from a helicopter at a high altitude and maneuvers by leaning forward <b>and</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> by rotating on a horizontal axis. The player must fall through rings of orbs in the sky before deploying the parachute, and must then attempt to land in a target area made up of concentric circles, with marks indicating the points awarded. The third event sees the player taking control of a rocket belt, which can be controlled with left and right yaw rotation, leaning forward and back to control speed. High {{and low levels of}} thrust allow high speed and finer control, respectively. The player must take off and fly through a series of rings, bars, or other objects before landing in a target area. The objective of the fourth event, hang gliding, is to catch thermal currents (represented by ascending white dots), reach a specified altitude, and then land {{as close as possible to}} the center of a gray square target.|$|E

5|$|The last {{scheduled}} London Transport steam {{passenger train}} on the branch left Chesham at 12.11am on 12 September 1960. 1,917 passengers used {{the line that}} day, in comparison with a typical Sunday usage of around 100. Earlier on 11 September descendants of the Chesham residents who had attended Watkin's original meeting to promote the railway, along with 86-year-old Albert Wilcox who had been present {{at the opening of}} the line, rode the steam shuttle to Chalfont& Latimer <b>and</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> attended a ceremony in Chesham's Council Chamber. (Although the 12.11am service from Chesham on 12 September 1960 was the last scheduled London Transport steam service to use the line, a steam train left Marylebone for Chesham each morning at 3.55am to deliver newspapers, returning as the first passenger train from Chesham at 5.58am. This journey to Marylebone was open to the public but was unadvertised and did not appear in published timetables. This arrangement continued to be operated by steam locomotive until 18 June 1962.) The Ashbury passenger cars, which by now had each covered around , were retired from service. The last steam-powered passenger services on the remaining non-electrified section between Amersham and Aylesbury ran on 9 September 1961. The line between Amersham and Aylesbury was handed over to British Rail, leaving Chesham as the westernmost point of the London Underground network. The goods yard at Chesham was closed in 1966, and a train hauled by a former GWR 5700 Class locomotive removed the track from the goods yard, the last steam service to use the line. On 17 October 1967 the newspaper train service and its return journey to Marylebone, by this time worked by a British Rail diesel multiple unit, was abandoned, leaving the branch exclusively operated by London Transport trains.|$|E
5|$|The {{mandible}} is best {{represented by}} YGSP 32727, {{one of two}} specimens of the unnamed large species of Indraloris. It preserves both {{the right and left}} sides of the dentary, back {{to the level of the}} fourth lower premolars (p4), but is also damaged at the front. The jaw is deep below p4, but rapidly becomes shallower further to the front. The roots of two lower incisors and a much larger canine are preserved; the three roots cluster together, with the canine root above the incisor roots, suggesting that these teeth shared some function. The mental foramen, an opening in the jawbone, is below p4. A root for the deciduous second premolar (dp2) is preserved on both the left and right sides, but the tooth itself is not and it is not possible to determine whether dp2 had one or two roots. The right permanent second premolar (p2) is unerupted, but partially visible; it is a blade-shaped cutting tooth. The p3 bears a single cusp, somewhat anterior to the middle of the tooth, with crests descending from it towards the front <b>and</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> weak cingula on the inner and outer sides. It is supported by two roots, which are close together.|$|E
5|$|The mandible, {{which is}} {{severely}} damaged and lacks the condyloid, coronoid, and angular processes {{at the back}} of the bone, contains the second and third molar and part of the lower incisor, but the first molar is missing. The capsular process of the lower incisor, a slight raising of the mandibular bone at the back end of the incisor, is small. The preserved alveoli, the impressions left by the roots, show that the first molar was supported by large roots at the front <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> a smaller root in between these. The second molar is about square and shows the four main cusps commonly present in rodents: the protoconid, metaconid, hypoconid, and entoconid. A strongly developed mesolophid (a crest) is also present, as in most oryzomyines. The main valley between the cusps, the hypoflexid, is broad and V-shaped. The third molar is as long as the second, but it is narrower and the entoconid is poorly developed. Again, the hypoflexid is broad and V-shaped. The length of the toothrow at the alveoli is 8.7mm. The length of the second molar is 2.5mm and the width is 2.2mm. The third molar has a length of 2.5mm and width of 1.8mm.|$|E
