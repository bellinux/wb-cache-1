5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{auctioning}} permits provides {{the government with}} revenues. These revenues {{could be used to}} fund low-carbon investment, and also fund cuts in distortionary taxes.

Ross Garnaut states that full auctioning will provide greater transparency and accountability and lower implementation and transaction costs as governments retain control over the permit revenue.|$|E

5|$|Health care {{delivery}} in Nigeria is a concurrent {{responsibility of the}} three tiers of government in the country, and the private sector.

The new strategy dramatically increased accessibility through community-based healthcare reform, resulting in more efficient <b>and</b> <b>equitable</b> provision of services.|$|E

Equitable tracing, on the other hand, relies on the claimant having an equitable interest in the property, and can succeed where the property has been mixed with other property.|$|E

5|$|As {{one of the}} two {{principal}} common law courts along with the Common Pleas, the King's Bench's jurisdiction and caseload was significantly challenged by the rise of the Court of Chancery <b>and</b> <b>equitable</b> doctrines in the 15th and 16th centuries. To recover, the King's Bench undertook a scheme of revolutionary reform, creating less expensive, faster and more versatile types of pleading in the form of bills as opposed to the more traditional writs. Although not immediately stemming the tide, in the long term it helped the King's Bench not only recover but increase its workload. While there was a steep decline in business from 1460 to 1540, as the new reforms began to take effect the King's Bench's business was significantly boosted; between 1560 and 1640, it rose tenfold.|$|E
5|$|This section covers {{compliance}} with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA). This act provides for uniform <b>and</b> <b>equitable</b> treatment of persons displaced by a federal programs from their homes, businesses, or farms, including assuring just compensation and assisting in relocation. For example, if {{the construction of a}} highway under a federal program requires the expropriation of homes, the expropriation must be made by either providing fair compensation for that property or providing assistance for, or reimbursement of, relocation expenses incurred by the affected person. The Compliance Supplement suggests verifying that the property acquired is appraised by qualified independent appraisers, the appraisals are examined by a review appraiser to assure acceptability, and that after acceptance, the review appraiser certifies the recommended or approved value of the property for just compensation to the owner.|$|E
5|$|As {{professional}} baseball became increasingly profitable, players frequently raised grievances against owners over issues of control <b>and</b> <b>equitable</b> income distribution. During the major leagues' early decades, players on various teams occasionally attempted strikes, which routinely failed when their jobs were sufficiently threatened. In general, the strict rules of baseball contracts and the reserve clause, which bound players to their teams {{even when their}} contracts had ended, tended to keep the players in check. Motivated by dislike for particularly stingy owner Charles Comiskey and gamblers' payoffs, real and promised, members of the Chicago White Sox conspired to throw the 1919 World Series. The Black Sox Scandal {{led to the formation}} of a new National Commission of baseball that drew the two major leagues closer together. The first major league baseball commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, was elected in 1920. That year also saw the founding of the Negro National League; the first significant Negro league, it would operate until 1931. For part of the 1920s, it was joined by the Eastern Colored League.|$|E

5|$|The Minister can declare any fence or barrier {{surrounding}} {{a part of}} a security area to be a perimeter fence. The Commissioner of Police is permitted to take steps to prevent people from crossing the fence or passing articles over, through or under the fence, including defensive measures that involve or may involve danger to life. If the measures are taken in a place other than on, under or within the perimeter fence, the Commissioner must take precautions – including displaying prominent warning signs – to ensure that people do not accidentally enter the area. If anyone is injured or dies {{as a result of a}} defensive measure, no compensation is payable unless the Minister certifies that it is just <b>and</b> <b>equitable</b> for such compensation to be paid. It is an offence to cross or attempt to cross, or pass or attempt to pass any article over, though or under a perimeter fence except at an authorized entry point; and to damage, attempt to damage or tamper with any fence or any gate or movable barrier at an entry point.|$|E
5|$|With {{the growth}} of bowl games, it became {{difficult}} to determine a national champion in a fair <b>and</b> <b>equitable</b> manner. As conferences became contractually bound to certain bowl games (a situation known as a tie-in), match-ups that guaranteed a consensus national champion became increasingly rare. In 1992, seven conferences and independent Notre Dame formed the Bowl Coalition, which attempted to arrange an annual No.1 versus No.2 matchup based on the final AP poll standings. The Coalition lasted for three years; however, several scheduling issues prevented much success; tie-ins still took precedence in several cases. For example, the Big Eight and SEC champions could never meet, since they were contractually bound to different bowl games. The coalition also excluded the Rose Bowl, arguably the most prestigious game in the nation, and two major conferences—the Pac-10 and Big Ten—meaning that it had limited success. In 1995, the Coalition {{was replaced by the}} Bowl Alliance, which reduced the number of bowl games to host a national championship game to three—the Fiesta, Sugar, and Orange Bowls—and the participating conferences to five—the ACC, SEC, Southwest, Big Eight, and Big East. It was agreed that the No.1 and No.2 ranked teams gave up their prior bowl tie-ins and were guaranteed to meet in the national championship game, which rotated between the three participating bowls. The system still did not include the Big Ten, Pac-10, or the Rose Bowl, and thus still lacked the legitimacy of a true national championship.|$|E
