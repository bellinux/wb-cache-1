5|$|Fielding was {{concerned}} with the audience's reaction to his various scenes. This is internally reflected in {{the actions of the}} character Merital in Love in Several Masques in controlling the behaviour of Helen and that many of his characters believe that they are either actors or are performing on a stage. <b>Also,</b> <b>this</b> is a primary concern of Fielding's when he crafted his Scriblerian plays.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{around the}} year 350 BC, the {{senators}} and the plebeian tribunes began to grow closer. The Senate began giving tribunes more power, and the tribunes began to feel indebted to the Senate. As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators began to routinely secure the office of tribune for {{members of their own}} families. <b>Also,</b> <b>this</b> period saw the enacting of the plebiscitum Ovinium, which transferred the power to appoint new senators from the consuls to the censors. This law also required the censors to appoint any newly elected magistrate to the Senate, which probably resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} number of plebeian senators.|$|E
5|$|During {{construction}} of the Voss Line from Bergen to Voss, there was a proposal to extend the line from Voss to Granvin on the Hardangerfjord. The plans were again taken up to consideration with the {{construction of}} the Bergen Line, but <b>also</b> <b>this</b> time the plans were scrapped. Some people wanted the line to be a tramway and when it was passed by the Parliament of Norway on 12 July 1919; the plans incorporated some elements of a tramway, giving the line a lower standard than the mainline. The railway was to be built electrified, and construction started in 1921. However, {{there was a lack of}} engineers, forcing a slow pace. On 5 November 1923, parliament passed the final plans for the railway, and the pace of construction was accelerated.|$|E
5|$|In 1884 Colonial Parliament passed The Railway Construction Act, which {{authorised}} fifty-nine {{new lines}} to almost {{every corner of}} the colony, and thus became known as the Octopus Act. The proposed lines would serve both new agricultural towns and support suburban land speculation. It was <b>also</b> <b>this</b> decade that the first narrow gauge line was opened from Wangaratta to Whitfield, with three other lines following by 1910. The South Gippsland line was also opened from Dandenong to Leongatha by 1891. However, by the late 1890s the majority of the colony was now covered in railways, {{with the exception of the}} Mallee country in the north west of the colony which saw further line openings, such as the Mildura line in 1903.|$|E

5|$|In 1936, US 322 was {{extended}} into New Jersey, running from a ferry dock on the Delaware River in Bridgeport and continuing east from there through Mullica Hill and Glassboro to Williamstown, where it followed Route 42 to McKee City and U.S. Route 40/Route 48 to Atlantic City. In 1939, {{the portion of}} US 322 between the ferry dock and Route 44 (now U.S. Route 130) was legislated as Route S44, a spur of Route 44, while the route between there and Route 42 in Williamstown was legislated as Route 51. It is <b>also</b> <b>this</b> section between Bridgeport and Williamstown that was not in state highway jurisdiction at the time.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study done}} by Rosamund Weatherall, Heather Joshi and Susan Macran of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 1994, the {{research}} presented suggests that women presented with the double burden have a lower mortality rate than women who are simply housewives. The women who were observed that had part-time jobs had a mortality rate lower than the women with full-time jobs and children. The same study also suggests that women who have young children {{are less likely to}} die than women who have no children or have older children. Although this evidence can not be strictly attributed to the double burden of having children and a career field, it can give a good indication of a trend in society. <b>Also,</b> <b>this</b> study was conducted in multiple countries including England, Wales, and the United States which gives the information presented from the study a more global perspective on the double burden.|$|E
