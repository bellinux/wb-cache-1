It uses a managed registry (providing social and technical infrastructure). It does not assume any specific business model for the provision of identifiers or services and enables other existing services to link to it in defined ways. Several approaches for making identifiers persistent have been proposed. The comparison of persistent identifier approaches is difficult because they are not all doing the same thing. Imprecisely referring to a set of schemes as [...] "identifiers" [...] doesn't mean that they can be compared easily. Other [...] "identifier systems" [...] may be enabling technologies with low barriers to entry, providing an easy to use labeling mechanism that allows anyone to set up a new instance (examples include Persistent Uniform Resource Locator (PURL), URLs, Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs), etc.), but may lack some of the functionality of a registry-controlled scheme and will usually lack accompanying metadata in a controlled scheme. The DOI system does not have this approach and should not be compared directly to such identifier schemes. Various applications using such enabling technologies with added features have been devised that meet some of the features offered by the DOI system for specific sectors (e.g., ARK).|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{works on}} the {{evaluation}} assignment and consolidation problems that often appear in various contexts in academia. The studies of evaluations are dedicated {{to the development of}} techniques that enable decision makers to cope with the increasing complexity of our world. Applications of evaluation assignment can be seen in problems such as the conference paper-reviewer assignment, the research proposal review assignment, the journal impact survey assignment, etc. Here we propose a new variant of assignment problem that to our knowledge has not been addressed yet, which we name as 'the non-dispersed assignment problem for evaluation purposes'. In the problem, the assignees are research papers, manuscripts, proposals, or surveys, and the <b>assigners</b> are peer reviewers or experts. This new variant not only considers the 'expertise matching' feature that requires each assignee is sent to <b>assigners</b> who are 'as expert as possible', but also addresses the 'non-dispersion' feature that facilitate meaningful consolidation of partial rankings of assignees by multiple <b>assigners</b> into a final composite ranking for further decision making. The problem is shown to be strongly NP-Hard. To solve it practically, we formulate it as an Integer Programming (IP) model that has an objective to maximize the sum of the assignment score and evaluation score of candidate assignments. We find that as the problem size grows, the IP model quickly expands to an extent that the ILOG CPLEX Solver can hardly manage. Therefore, two meta-heuristic approaches, Tabu Search (TS) and Genetic algorithm (GA), are proposed. To measure the performance of different algorithms, extensive computational experiments are conducted, showing that while small problem instances can be solved ILOG CPLEX, the tabu search meta-heuristic is ideal for solving instances in the order of magnitude of hundreds of <b>assigners</b> and assignees under realistic problem settings. We next shift our focus on the evaluation consolidation problem by presenting a case study for ranking academic journals for the Information System (IS) area. We demonstrate the flaws of the currently popular approach - the average-score method, and develop a more rigorous model for ranking consolidation, the minimum ranking reversal IP model. An expedient replacement to the average-score method that is based on the group-AHP methodology is also proposed. As the problem is proven to be strongly NP-Hard, we further conduct intensive experiments on the evaluation consolidation problem instances. Empirical hardness model is developed step-by-step by a collection of DOE tools, revealing an important instance feature, the density of consistency, which strongly affects the empirical hardness of problem instances. Tabu search is selected from a collections of meta-heuristics based on experimental results that examine the trade-offs between solution quality and runtime. An empirical hardness model is developed to predict of the run-time distribution of CPLEX and helps algorithm selection between tabu search and CPLEX in a portfolio approach. The portfolio, which is based on the empirical hardness model, is shown to be a stronger ensemble that outperforms all individual algorithms, and can be integrated into a decision support framework in various practical contexts...|$|R

The ‘transitive comparative’ exhibits two special restrictions: the predicate must be one that accepts differential measure phrases, and the measure phrase must be overt. We argue that these facts support an analysis of the syntax of the adjectival projection in which gradable adjectives do not project degree arguments, as typically assumed, but do so only in combination with a covert morpheme l. Building on the proposal that argument DPs in Mandarin require Case, we hypothesize that there are (at least) two case <b>assigners</b> for standards of comparison in Mandarin: the overt morpheme bi and the covert morpheme l found in transitive comparatives...|$|R

50|$|A {{term used}} in government-binding theory for a {{specification}} {{of the types}} of variation that a principle of grammar manifests among different languages. It is suggested that there are no rules of grammar in the traditional sense, but only principles which can take a slightly different form in different languages. For example, a head parameter specifies the positions of heads within phrases (e.g. head-first in English, head-last in Japanese). The adjacency parameter of case theory specifies whether case <b>assigners</b> must be adjacent to their noun phrases (e.g. to the left in English, to the right in Chinese). The pro-drop (or ‘null subject’) parameter determines whether the subject of a clause can be suppressed. Determining the parametric values for given languages is known as parameter-setting. The overall approach has been called the principles and parameters theory (PPT) of universal grammar, and has since come to be applied outside of syntactic contexts, notably in characterizing phonological relations. Later versions of metrical phonology, for example, recognize a series of parameters governing the way metrical feet should be represented, such as quantity sensitivity and directionality.|$|R

We found that rating agencies play a significant role in the below investment grade CMBS market, mainly through their evolving credit assessing methodologies. However, rating agencies' business models and structure of the CMBS rating industry are not considered to have significant impact on subordination level decisions. It is found that most of the variations in the subordination levels can be attributed to non-rating agency factors such as change in CMBS pool compositions, change in CMBS loan structures and increasing scrutiny from the Below Investment Grade buyers. by Pau Chi Hsu.

40|$|This master thesis {{commenced}} in {{the beginning}} of September 2006. It was performed {{as a part of the}} project OPTIVe (Optimized System Integration for Safe Interaction in Vehicles). OPTIVe’s purpose is to investigate, evaluate and demonstrate methods and technical solutions for safe, efficient and cost effective integration of HMI systems in cars. It is a cooperative project between Volvo Car Corporation and Luleå University of Technology among others, which were also the <b>assigners</b> for this thesis. OPTIVe has executed surveys in USA and Sweden about which information instruments the driver desires to have displayed in the automobile and on which display. The purpose with this master thesis was to compile the answers regarding the instrument cluster and analyze which information instruments should be placed in that display. The results would be different design concepts suitable for Sweden and USA and if possible a concept suited for both countries. The result of the survey, when both countries were taken under consideration, was that the users desired to have the warning symbols Low oil pressure, Low fuel level, Parking brake engaged, High motor temperature, Charging system failure, and ABS failure displayed in the instrument cluster. The driver instruments desired were Speedometer, Fuel level and Motor temperature level indicator and no In-vehicle technology instruments. This lead to that four different concepts were designed which were suited for both countries. The first two concepts had a simple and clean design which was further developed into two new concepts with more decorations. When comparing the countries and the genders, instruments and warning symbols that will differ is the Tachometer, Low tire pressure and Engine in need of service. Testing the four concepts in the eye-track lead to discussions about changes and improvements that could be made and also, to a questionnaire handling the speedometer. The new questionnaire was conducted since it was discovered that the pointer of the speedometer in all four concepts was a new idea in this context and the question was if it attracted the drivers or not, if the standard speedometer was more popular, or if a combination of the two was more likely to please. The speedometer questionnaire showed that the idea itself was good but that a combination between the standard speedometer and the modern speedometer was more popular. The combination speedometer will therefore be used in all the concepts. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

40|$|Since {{marketing}} {{could be}} relevant for any organization, even those whose {{primary goal is}} non-economic and especially those who undertake a customer-oriented approach, this master’s thesis will focus on one of its elements: Promotions or marketing communications. The research problem has been formulated as follows: The {{purpose of this study}} is to make an assessment of the marketing communications process of a non-profit organization. The frame of reference, based on a literature review of performed research within the area, will guide this research. The marketing communications process defined involves a message sender and a message receiver. It involves the three major concerns of WHOM to reach, WHAT to say and HOW it should be done. Further, it includes the planning and development of communications. Above all: It includes the connection to the overall strategic direction of the entire organization. To explore and to describe the marketing communications process of a non- profit organization from a managerial perspective, a case study has been conducted at a large Swedish governmental agency – the Swedish National Road Administration (SNRA). Managers of information and communication, working centrally as well as regionally, have been interviewed. To explore the process from the receiver’s perspective, a pilot study has been conducted. A focus group with eleven young people was conducted in the city of Luleå. Their perception of the SNRA was explored, as well as how it communicates with young people. In order to answer the second research question, how the process of other non-profit organizations is different, the Swedish Customs was interviewed. In addition, the planning and development procedure of the Climate campaign was assessed. The government and the Swedish Environmental protection Agency commission it. The findings of this study indicates that the sender of marketing communications, in this case the SNRA, has internal problems as well as problems related to the receiver or target audience. Internally, it is sometimes hard to get hold of the overall picture of what is being communicated. Furthermore, the target audience becomes a second priority when internal <b>assigners</b> must be pleased. Even though things are perceived to improve, the SNRA does not succeed in targeting their segments consistently. The concerns of WHAT, and HOW, rather than WHOM, seem to dominate decision-making. The logical central steps in communications planning, described in theory, are not generally performed that logically by the SNRA. On the other hand, the planning procedure of the Climate campaign makes an example of how it should be performed. Concerning how marketing communications connects to the overall strategic direction, the SNRA has a corporate mission and corporate objectives that can set direction. However, too many managers ask for the main thread. According to this study, there is a gap between corporate strategies and marketing communications. A marketing strategy does not even exist. It might be on its way and all managers welcome its main elements: segmentation, targeting and positioning. The managerial implications suggested from this study do not just involve managers of communication and information. It involves all mangers responsible for carrying out the mission of the SNRA, and especially those responsible for coordinating the marketing mix: the products, the services and the values the SNRA offers. The improvements of the marketing communications process will not only benefit marketing communication. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|Crowdsourcing {{has become}} one of the most popular topics in both academia and {{industry}} in the past few years. By hiring workers online, task <b>assigners</b> can take advantage of the wisdom of the crowd and solve problems that used to only be solvable by experts or that are too hard for automated computer algorithms. Consensus tasks are some of the most common tasks in the crowdsourcing domain, e. g. labeling, classification, pattern recognition, and etc. To solve consensus tasks, a group of workers are hired to report possible outcomes, and their opinions are aggregated to produce a final prediction. When working with consensus tasks, crowd workers’ quality information is always valuable for system designers to find better workers and to devise opinion aggregation approaches that can produce predictions with higher accuracy. Traditional approaches used in many research literatures either assume every worker has a fixed quality, or the worker population as a whole has a fixed quality. They calculate worker quality from historical data, assume it stays as is and use it for estimating existing workers’ future performance and future workers’ starting performance. We argue this is not true, especially for more complicated tasks where workers may need time and experience to fathom the idea and become adequate. We think the learning curve model used in factories and plants to model traditional workers’ productivity and quality can be adopted to work in a crowdsourcing context, where workers quality should improve too as they work on more tasks and become experienced. We modified the hyperbolic learning curve and setup a sleep spindle detection experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk to validate our argument. The results proved our hypothesis that crowd workers do achieve higher quality as they work on more tasks, and different workers have different quality and learning speed. Moreover, our linear regression test shows that hyperbolic learning curve is a good fit to model crowd workers’ learning process. This gives us a more accurate approach to estimate and project crowd workers’ quality. With the help of learning curve model, we design a new dynamic hiring system that can make smart tradeoffs between workers’ current quality and future potential, as well as the accuracy of aggregated prediction and hiring cost. It can take advantage of crowd workers’ quality improvement, find, train, stay with high potential workers, and reduce the number of hired workers when some of the top performers stand out. Our system models the hiring process as a Markov Decision Process, and uses Monte Carlo Planning to find the best hiring path which optimizes the utility of both prediction accuracy and worker training. We compared our proposed hiring mechanism against other common methods such as randomly selecting workers and a bandit based approach which lets all workers work on a small training set first and picks the best performing ones. From results in both sleep spindle detection tasks and simulated tasks, our proposed dynamic hiring system yields a competitive or better performance with significant saving in hiring cost. Moreover, to handle situations where crowd workers may not always be available and they are not free to hire to work on tutorial tasks, we extend our dynamic hiring mechanism to incorporate randomization so the system can choose between utilizing high quality workers and exploring unknown workers. From our simulation tests, the extended hiring system works as expected and can save even more in hiring cost while providing high quality predictions. Our dynamic hiring system especially outperforms traditional hiring approaches when the worker population is mixed where some workers have higher availability or learning speed. Overall, our dynamic hiring system is always able to find and take advantage of high potential workers and make hiring decisions adaptively. Our work opens up a new direction for hiring mechanism design in crowdsourcing settings where the usage of learning curves enable us to distinguish crowd workers and to model them more accurately...|$|R
40|$|The rating {{quality of}} credit rating {{agencies}} (CRAs) attracted substantial attention from researchers after {{the global financial}} crisis. In particular, the potential conflicts of interest of CRAs have been widely criticised. Investors expect CRAs to provide accurate and timely ratings as an evaluation benchmark. However, CRAs collect most of their revenue from bond issuers; thus, they {{have an incentive to}} cater to issuers, resulting in inflated and non-informative ratings. This study examines how incumbent issuer-pay CRAs in China changed their ratings strategy in response to a reform in the credit rating industry. This reform introduces a new independent rating agency, China Credit Rating (CCR), which utilised a combination of public utility and investor-pay business models. CCR receives great support from the government which prevent it from the pressure given by issuers and investors. Meanwhile, CCR collects part of its revenue from subscribers, reducing the possibility of government budget shortage. As a result, CCR tends {{to play a role in}} disciplining incumbent issuer-pay CRAs&rsquo; rating behaviour and further improving ratings&rsquo; information quality. By investigating how incumbent issuer-pay CRAs in China respond to the entry of CCR, this thesis finds that the rating inflation for firms that are also covered by CCR are significantly lower than those not covered by CCR. Moreover, market reaction to rating changes by CRAs on firms covered by CCR is more pronounced after CCR&rsquo;s rating coverage initiation. These results indicate that ratings information quality from CRAs has been improved in the sense that rating inflation is attenuated and ratings are associated with larger market reaction when CCR is present. This result adds empirical evidence to the literature documenting the influence of the introduction of a new rating agency with an alternative business model to issuer-pay rating agencies. This research further shows that the scope of information quality improvement is associated with different information scenarios and the reputation of the rating <b>assigners.</b> Specifically, the information quality improvements are more pronounced for firms facing better investor protection environment (e. g. advanced marketization or better legal rights protection) and for ratings from more reputable CRAs. These results suggest that both internal (i. e. CRAs&rsquo; reputation) and external forces (i. e. investor protection environment) are crucial to attain higher informativeness for CRAs&rsquo; ratings with the presence of CCR. In addition, this study provides primary evidence that certification via reputable CRAs is beneficial to issuers in the bond market in China, with regard to save financing cost. After considering the issuer-reputable CRA match, this thesis finds bonds rated by the most reputable CRAs to be associated with a lower yield spread (higher bond price), revealing the investors&rsquo; recognition of the rating quality of reputable CRAs. This result is consistent with the traditional certification hypothesis and underlying reputational mechanism. This research further finds such benefits are larger for firms with worse investor protection environment or with higher risks. On the other hand, yield premium is significantly lower in the post-CCR period and for firms not covered by CCR. These results illustrate that reputable CRAs play a role of certifying the quality of firms&rsquo; debt securities, and this certification effect is reinforced by the entry of CCR. Overall, this study contributes to a growing body of literature that examines how different business models of CRA affect credit ratings by studying the efficiency of an innovative trial in China, making a supplement to the relevant theoretical models, empirical studies and government proposals. It also complements the study on reputational mechanism of credit rating agencies, calls for investors&rsquo; attention on the different reactions of different issuer-pay CRAs, and emphasizes the importance of investor protection environment construction. This study also supplements the research on certification role of credit rating agencies, and provides a sight for bond issuers and investors when evaluating bonds rated by CRAs with different reputation...|$|R
