500|$|Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal {{called it}} [...] "A first-rate action thriller, a vivid {{evocation}} of urban warfare in Iraq, a penetrating study of heroism and {{a showcase for}} austere technique, terse writing and a trio of brilliant performances." [...] The Toronto Star critic Peter Howell said, [...] "Just when you think the battle of Iraq war dramas has been fought and lost, <b>along</b> <b>comes</b> one that demands to be seen... If you can sit through The Hurt Locker without your heart nearly pounding through your chest, you must be made of granite." [...] Entertainment Weeklys film critic Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the film the rare [...] "A" [...] rating, calling it, [...] "an intense, action-driven war pic, a muscular, efficient standout that simultaneously conveys the feeling of combat from within {{as well as what}} it looks like on the ground. This ain't no war videogame." ...|$|E

2500|$|Both Arista and Elektra {{attempted}} {{to sign the}} band, but in the end, Elektra was chosen, due to its lack of new wave acts, allowing the band to stand out more {{than they would have}} had they signed with the new wave-heavy Arista. David Robinson said of the choice, [...] "Here they had the Eagles and Jackson Browne, and <b>along</b> <b>comes</b> this crazy Boston band who wanted a black-and-white photo collage on their cover." ...|$|E

2500|$|Senior {{leaders at}} several large automakers, {{including}} Nissan and General Motors, {{have stated that}} the Roadster was a catalyst which demonstrated that there is pent-up consumer demand for more efficient vehicles. GM vice-chairman Bob Lutz said in 2007 that the Tesla Roadster inspired him to push GM to develop the Chevrolet Volt, a plug-in hybrid sedan prototype that aims to reverse years of dwindling market share and massive financial losses for America's largest automaker. In an August 2009 edition of The New Yorker, Lutz was quoted as saying, [...] "All the geniuses here at General Motors kept saying lithium-ion technology is 10 years away, and Toyota agreed with us – and boom, <b>along</b> <b>comes</b> Tesla. So I said, 'How come some tiny little California startup, run by guys who know nothing about the car business, can do this, and we can't?' That was the crowbar that helped break up the log jam." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} was filmed on March 30, 2010, in Beverly Hills, California, and was {{directed}} by Ray Kay, director of Bieber's [...] "Baby" [...] video. On the topic of choosing the lead girl, Kingston told MTV News, [...] "I picked the main girl, basically, because Justin is 16 and I'm 20 years old, so {{it had to be}} a girl that fit the both of us, because in the video and song, she's trying to play the both of us. So there had to be a contrast. She fit it perfectly." [...] Additionally, Kingston explained the plot of the video to Rap-Up, commenting, [...] "The video is basically about this girl trying to play both of us and at the end... we end up both at the same place at one time, and she's left with a stupid look on her face." [...] Appearances are made by Bieber's friend, Christian Beadles, as well as rapper Lil Romeo and singer/actress Jasmine Villegas, whose appearance further fuelled media speculation Villegas and Bieber were romantically involved after a previous appearance in his music video for 'Baby'. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News reviewed the video, [...] "Here's the play-by-play: While Kingston and the lady in question are flirting out on the deck, Bieber is chilling inside. But, wait — there she is flirting with Bieber while Kingston is hanging out, wondering where she went. The fickle girl eventually leaves Bieber to chill with Kingston, and then — boom — there she is with Bieber again. And, well, you get it. Of course, the 'eenie-meenie-miny-moe lover' eventually gets caught. While she's chatting up Kingston, <b>along</b> <b>comes</b> Bieber, and her game is blown. The dudes are cool with it. Well, they're not cool with her playing them, but they seem to remain friends despite both going for the same girl." ...|$|E
