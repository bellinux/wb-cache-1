40|$|Palaeosinkhole {{features}} characterise the Maltese islands, {{some of them}} reaching relevant dimensions, {{especially in}} the Island of Gozo. They show varied morphostructures: sub-circular bays, large depressions and rounded buttes or mesas (due to relief inversion) are the resulting geomorphic expressions. A detailed geological and geomorphological study of the palaeosinkholes located in the NW sector of the Island of Gozo {{has been carried out}} with the aim of investigating the evolution of the associated landforms. A field survey and a mapping campaign at a 1 : 5000 -scale, coupled with aerial-photo interpretation, has been carried out and a spatial database has been implemented within a GIS software. Existing evolutionary models have been critically analysed and new models proposed. Thanks to the detailed exploration of the collapse palaeosinkholes, it has been deducted that at a certain stage, selective erosion has become the main factor influencing their geomorphological evolution. Positive reliefs (rounded buttes or mesas) were formed where more resistant terrains were located inside the sinkholes; conversely, depressions and sub-circular bays developed where the sinkholes infill was surrounded by more resistant rocks. Collapse structures {{do not seem to be}} active at present and their activity probably ceased during the Miocene, suggesting that karst subsidence processes are not the only responsible for the final shaping of the above-mentioned subcircular depressions and bays. The Gozitan rounded bays related to the palaeosinkholes have been compared with similar sub-circular coastal landforms located along the southern coast of the Island of Malta. The investigation showed that the latter are not caused or influenced by karst processes, but linked to the <b>attitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>strata</b> and to their different resistance to erosion. The bays analysed in Gozo and Malta are morphologically similar but genetically different, representing a relevant example of equifinality. The Gozitan sinkhole-related landforms have also been compared with those of the Island of Malta, generally much smaller in size, which allowed their different geomorphological evolution to be pointed out...|$|E

While many newer developments are built with green star ratings, retrofitting existing buildings with shared governance structures is sometimes viewed as problematic. This paper explores the use of retrofitting for environmental sustainability within Victoria’s owner corporation environment. Little is known about how the use of privatized governance structures within apartment and townhouse developments adds to the complexity of implementing sustainability measures. This paper investigates the motivations and <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>strata</b> managers and committees of management in relation to the retrofit measures by drawing on the findings of 13 semi-structured interviews with committee members and strata managers. Findings revealed that there was a substantial understanding of the benefits associated with retrofitting buildings for environmental sustainability; however, a range <b>of</b> reasons and <b>attitudes</b> existed within the strata environment that affected the implementation of such measures...|$|R

These rock cliffs have been modeled from coarse to fine-grained, quartz-feldspar sandstones from the Oligocene-Miocene. The morphology of these cliffs is derived from selective erosion.

30|$|In the Puli basin, {{the depths}} of the bedrocks are about 300 ∼ 870 m by the {{microtremor}} array measurements (Fig. 14 (a)) while these are about 300 ∼ 600 m by Huang (2008) (Fig. 14 (b)). The depth of the bedrock is deeper in the central part (e.g. PUL, DAH) of the basin while it is relatively shallower at the edges (e.g. SIN, PIP). The depth of the bedrock gradually increases from the edge {{to the center of the}} basin and the deepest area is near Heng-Chih-Cheng (DAH). Moreover, some sites (SIG and CUF) with deeper bedrocks are found in the northern and eastern parts using the microtremor array measurements (Fig. 14 (a)). We deploy three sites (CUH, NAK and PUL) at the downtown area while the explosion experiment is not easy to survey (Huang, 2008; Fig. 14 (b)). According to the inverted results, we can get the detailed S-wave velocity structures in the study. However, the explosion experiments can clearly describe the <b>stratum</b> and <b>attitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>stratum</b> (e.g. Fig. 13 (b)). Overall, the results from microtremor array measurements and from Huang (2008), regarding the bedrock depths, present similar patterns though there are some differences in detail. The possible reasons causing the discrepancies between these results are due to the differences of the measured sites, the measurement methods and the techniques of data processing used.|$|R

40|$|High {{mortality}} {{conditioned by}} both endogenous and exogenous causes {{is one of}} the challenges of today that will restrict the development of Russian regions and modernization of the economy. The paper presents the results of a multidimensional typological analysis of the subjects of the Russian Federation according to rural cause-of-death patterns. The role and influence of the social factors reducing mortality in different typological groups of Russian regions are examined. The need to apply a regionally differentiated approach in rural mortality reducing social policies is explained. It is shown in the paper that mortality rates and patterns are important indicators of public health mirroring the <b>attitude</b> <b>of</b> the state towards its citizens, {{the quality of life of}} the population, the values and social <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> different population <b>strata,</b> the rate <b>of</b> development of public health services, the availability of hi-tech medical services, the dominant stereotypes of social behavior and the spiritual condition of the society. Mortality rates and patterns both have social grounds: they alter as the society changes, influenced by these changes, and in turn affect the direction, rates and nature of these transformations. Interregional differences in mortality rates and cause-of-death patterns are to a large extent determined by the social conditions in which people live and work. It is explained why social and demographic policies should be integrated to reduce mortality in Russian regions. The regression equations run in this study are evaluated by using the data presented by the Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) in open access on its website. As a result of this study, the most important rural mortality reducing factors are singled out that cannot be ignored when drawing up regional strategies of rural social development and regional health-care modernization plans.

40|$|Underground coal {{extraction}} causes failure and movement <b>of</b> overlying <b>strata,</b> which could also {{result in the}} dislocation of vertical surface boreholes. Investigating the correlation between the dislocation of surface boreholes and the broken <b>of</b> overlying <b>strata</b> is <b>of</b> great significance in deducing the mining-induced dynamic movement <b>of</b> overlying <b>strata,</b> which cannot be seen inside the ‘black box’. Field measurement, laboratory experiment and theoretical analysis were employed to study the mechanism of the mining-induced dislocation of surface boreholes, and its relationship with the movement <b>of</b> overlying <b>strata.</b> Due to different deflection angles <b>of</b> adjacent <b>strata,</b> the horizontal movement <b>of</b> <b>strata</b> varies, and this contributes primarily to the dislocation of borehole wall. As the development <b>of</b> <b>strata</b> movement from the mining level towards surface, the position of borehole dislocation also occurred upwards, and the highest borehole dislocation occurred at the same position <b>of</b> overlying Key <b>Stratum</b> (KS). In other words, when a KS breaks, borehole dislocation will occur and develop from the bottom of this KS until the bottom of an upper KS. These key findings can provide a theoretical basis for deducing the mining-induced movement <b>of</b> overlying <b>strata,</b> determining the KS position and assessing the water conductivity <b>of</b> broken <b>strata...</b>|$|R

40|$|Se presentan los resultados de un estudio paleomagnético de la Formación Matasiete, integrante del Grupo Chubut. Se analizó la estabilidad de las remanencias magnéticas empleando desmagnetización por altas temperaturas y por campos alternos. Estas rocas presentan susceptibilidades magnéticas relativamente altas. Los especímenes estudiados portan componentes viscosas blandas y de bajas temperaturas de desbloqueo cuyas direcciones son estadísticamente coincidentes entre sí y con la dirección que corresponde a un campo dipolar axial y geocéntrico para esa localidad. La remanencia prácticamente desaparece al alcanzar 580 ºC indicando que la magnetita es el {{principal}} portador magnético. En todos los casos se aislaron componentes características con desviaciones angulares máximas The {{results of}} a paleomagnetic study performed over the Matasiete Formation, belonging to the Chubut Group, are presented. Alternating field and thermal demagnetization techniques were employed to analyze {{the stability of the}} magnetic remanence. The studied specimens have relatively high magnetic susceptibilities. They have soft viscous and low unblocking temperature components. These components are statistically coincident {{with each other and with}} the geocentric axial dipole field direction for the locality. The magnetic remanences were removed below 580 ºC, indicating that magnetite is the main remanence carrier. Characteristic remanent magnetization directions were determined by principal component analysis with a maximum angular deviation smaller than 5 º. Given the similar <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> the <b>strata,</b> the fold-tests are indeterminate. When the structural correction is applied, the concentration of characteristic remanent magnetization directions increases. That increase suggests that these remanences are pretectonic. All virtual geomagnetic poles corresponding to the remanent magnetizations have a normal polarity. The paleomagnetic pole calculated in this study for the Matasiete Formation is located at 84. 7 ºS, 161. 2 ºE (n= 34, k= 17. 51, A 95 = 6. 1). That position is statistically equivalent to those of the PPs from Cerro Barcino Formation (112 - 125 Ma) and Los Adobes Formation (112 - 130 Ma), outcropping at Central Patagonia. The coincidence of these paleomagnetic poles supports the Hauterivian?-Barremian-Aptian age assigned to the Matasiete Formation on the base of different fosiliferous associations. As the normal polarity of all virtual geomagnetic poles suggests that these rocks were deposited during the Cretaceous normal superchron, an Aptian age is proposed for the Matasiete Formation...|$|R
