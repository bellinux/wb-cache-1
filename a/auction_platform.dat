The revenue-maximizing mechanism is a scoring auction that works as a crosss-ubsidization device between searchers and advertisers.

The disclosed infor-mation in the market we studied can be naturally separated into high and low quality levels. Not only does providing high-quality infor-mation which accurately reflects product characteristics increase con-sumer demand, but also an increase in the quantity of high-quality information will have a positive marginal effect. On the contrary, in-creasing the amount of low-quality information has almost no effect on demand...|$|R

40|$|Only {{registered}} {{businesses can}} charge and collect taxes on {{goods and services}} made in Taiwan. As auction sites are places where individuals can conduct business activities for profit without paying business taxes, Taiwan’s tax authority has ruled that profit-seeking individuals must register as businesses and pay taxes. However, the anonymity of sellers on Internet <b>auction</b> <b>platforms</b> poses challenges {{to the ability of}} the tax authority to enforce this ruling. This paper examines business tax policy for online auctions in Taiwan and then assesses the prospects of taxing sales on online auctions using a game theory model.

40|$|In online <b>auction</b> <b>platforms,</b> offers {{are listed}} {{side by side}} and may end {{at the same point}} in time. While {{theoretical}} studies predict efficient coordination across auctions, experimental and empirical studies observe efficiency losses, i. e. goods remain unsold. In order to mitigate this coordination failure, we contribute to the literature of auction design by introducing a stochastic deadline in parallel multiple auctions. In these parallel Candle Auctions, several auctions start at the same time but end (separately) due to a stochastic process. We think that the stochastic ending rule decreases the coordination failure because the threat of a sudden termination forces the bidders to coordinate across auctions early in the auction process. Indeed, we find that coordination is less pronounced in parallel Candle Auctions resulting in higher efficiencySimultaneous Auctions, Internet, Auction Design, Experimental Economics...|$|R

I introduce an experimental setup of three sellers and four buyers in an ascending second price auction environment where every seller runs one auction with a homogeneous good and the buyers are confronted with single unit demand. I find that sellers revenue is significantly lower than theory predicts {{due to the fact}} that some auctions did not receive bids whereas other auctions concentrated the bids of all bidders. Moreover, I observe a statistically higher revenue of sellers setting the minimum starting price. Furthermore, my study shows that the buyers submit bids which are significantly lower than the private valuation every buyer receives. Comparing the efficiency of the parallel multiple auction setup to a double auction control experiment, I find a significant lower efficiency in parallel multiple auctions due to the coordination failure of the buyers. simultaneous auctions, internet auctions, market design, electronic business...|$|R

40|$|Internet <b>auction</b> <b>platforms</b> are {{changing}} the face of transactions in many business sectors, including agriculture. We provide one of the first systematic examinations of the differences between internet and in-person auctions in agricultural input markets. A hedonic model estimated with used tractor transactions from Midwestern sellers pooled between eBay and in-person auctions reveals statistically distinct price surfaces for the two auction venues and predicts significantly lower prices for comparable equipment sold on eBay, though this difference is attenuated for tractors fully covered by eBay's buyer protection program and is fully absent for the most frequently traded tractor. An endogenous venue-selection model reveals that larger, more-valuable tractors {{are less likely to be}} offered on eBay, a choice that should enhance seller revenues. Furthermore, sellers in states with more valuable stocks of machinery, more frequent tractor sales, and a lower propensity to use the internet for agricultural marketing are more likely to offer tractors for sale via in-person auctions than on eBay. auctions, electronic commerce, eBay, farm equipment, hedonic models, Marketing, D 44, Q 13,...|$|R

40|$|Online <b>auction</b> <b>platforms</b> like eBay {{provide a}} wide range of auctions {{containing}} substitutable goods. Some of these auctions exhibit parallel elements which means that two or more auctions run side by side for a certain time. Experiments have shown that multiple auctions ending at the same time, result in significantly lower efficiency due to the coordination failure of the buyers. I introduce an experimental setup with three sellers and four buyers in an overlapping multiple second price auction environment, where every seller runs one auction with a homogeneous good and the buyers are confronted with single unit demand. Furthermore, I vary the degree of the overlap between the successive auctions. One main result is that sellers revenue is significantly higher in overlapping multiple auctions than in parallel multiple auctions. Moreover, I observe a lower coordination failure of the buyers in overlapping auctions than in parallel multiple auctions. Due to these results, efficiency in overlapping multiple auctions is higher compared to the efficiency in parallel multiple auctions. internet auctions, cross bidding, market design, electronic business...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of computerized agents has become pervasive in everyday live. In this paper, {{we examine the}} impact of agency on human bidders' affective processes and bidding behavior in an electronic auction environment. In particular, we use skin conductance response and heart rate measurements as proxies for the immediate emotions and overall arousal of human bidders in a lab experiment with human and computerized counterparts. Our results show that computerized agents mitigate the intensity of bidders' immediate emotions in response to discrete auction events, such as submitting a bid and winning or losing an auction, as well as the bidders¿ overall arousal levels during the auction. Moreover, bidding behavior and its relation to overall arousal are affected by agency: whereas overall arousal and bids are negatively correlated when competing against human bidders, this relationship is not observable for computerized agents. In other words, lower levels of agency yield less emotional behavior. The results of our study have implications for the design of electronic <b>auction</b> <b>platforms</b> and markets that include both human and computerized actors...|$|R
40|$|The CareAuction {{intermediary}} {{offers a}} reverse <b>auctioning</b> <b>platform</b> {{to support the}} allocation of individual maternity care patient requests between purchasers of health insurance companies (acting {{on behalf of their}} policy holders) and care providers. Since its introduction in 2005, CareAuction has contributed to a small price drop of maternity care and induced competition on the supply-side of the market. This is a result of increased transparency for both (demand and supply) sides. The quality of the maternity care that is provided is monitored by a newly introduced quality evaluation system, which includes the patient and introduces quality as another competitive factor next to price. Next to CareAuction, other intermediaries are still active in the health care sector, supporting the allocation of care between insurance companies and care providers. Findings indicate that the influence of CareAuction leads to the disintermediation of at least one other intermediary. Theory on electronic intermediaries and market dynamics is used to identify the added values that these two intermediaries (CareAuction and LTZ) create for the purchasers and providers of maternity care {{in the context of the}} maternity care market...|$|R
