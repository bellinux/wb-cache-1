5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Bermuda on August 25, and ultimately discontinued <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> later. Two cruise ships left Bermuda early {{to avoid the}} storm, and another two postponed their scheduled stops there. The threat of the storm, combined {{with a lack of}} passengers due to cruise ship diversions, resulted in the suspension of ferry service. Cristobal ultimately passed well to the northwest of the island, producing breezy conditions and heightened surf.|$|E
5|$|Fertilization by a spermatozoon, when it occurs, {{usually takes}} place in the ampulla, the widest section of the fallopian tubes. A fertilized egg {{immediately}} begins the process of embryogenesis, or development. The developing embryo takes <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> to reach the uterus and another three days to implant into the endometrium. It has usually reached the blastocyst stage at the time of implantation.|$|E
5|$|While Connie was {{meandering}} in {{the western}} Atlantic Ocean, its potential track posed problems for forecasters. On August7, a hurricane warning was issued from North Carolina to Norfolk, Virginia, with a hurricane alert further north to New York City. The Weather Bureau later extended the hurricane warnings to Delaware Breakwater, with storm warnings further northeast to Provincetown, Massachusetts. The alert for North Carolina was up for <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> until Connie moved inland.|$|E

5|$|In 1997 a {{paper was}} {{published}} that hypothesised {{the existence of}} a binary nucleus to fully explain the observed pattern of comet Hale–Bopp's dust emission observed in October 1995. The paper was based on theoretical analysis, and did not claim an observational detection of the proposed satellite nucleus, but estimated that it would have a diameter of about 30km, with the main nucleus being about 70km across, and would orbit in <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> at a distance of about 180km. This analysis was confirmed by observations in 1996 using Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2 of the Hubble Space Telescope which had taken images of the comet that revealed the satellite.|$|E
5|$|Overall, the {{hurricane}} affected 123,320people across Veracruz and Hidalgo, prompting {{the declaration of}} a state of emergency in 112municipalities. The declaration allowed the usage of emergency resources for the affected people. There were a total of six deaths in the country, five of which in Puebla. By <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> after the storm, all schools were reopened. The Mexican government distributed food, water, and construction materials for the areas most affected in Veracruz. Following the storm, about 500power workers were dispatched in Veracruz to restore electricity in the affected areas.|$|E
5|$|By 2007, Songpol Somsri, a Thai {{government}} scientist, had crossbred {{more than}} ninety varieties of durian to create Chantaburi No.1, a cultivar without the characteristic odour. Another hybrid, Chantaburi No. 3, develops the odour <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> after the fruit is picked, which enables an odourless transport yet satisfies consumers who prefer the pungent odour. On 22 May 2012, two other cultivars from Thailand that also lack the usual odour, Long Laplae and Lin Laplae, {{were presented to}} the public by Yothin Samutkhiri, governor of Uttaradit Province from where these cultivars were developed locally, while he announced the dates for the yearly durian fair of Laplae District, and the name giver to both cultivars.|$|E

5|$|Many {{species of}} chaetotonid gastrotrichs {{reproduce}} entirely by parthenogenesis. In these species, the male {{portions of the}} reproductive system are degenerate and non-functional, or, in many cases, entirely absent. Though the eggs have a diameter of less than 50 µm, they are still very large {{in comparison with the}} animals' size. Some species are capable of laying eggs that remain dormant during times of desiccation or low temperatures; these species, however, are also able to produce regular eggs, which hatch in one to four days, when environmental conditions are more favourable. The eggs of all gastrotrichs undergo direct development and hatch into miniature versions of the adult. The young typically reach sexual maturity in <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>days.</b> In the laboratory, Lepidodermella squamatum has lived for up to forty days, producing four or five eggs during the first ten days of life.|$|E
5|$|On August28, or <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> after Katrina {{struck the}} state, President George W. Bush {{declared}} a disaster area for Miami-Dade and Broward counties, which allocated {{federal funding for}} debris removal and other emergency services. Three days later, Monroe County was also declared a disaster areas, and {{on the same day}} the three counties were designated to receive funding for public assistance; this included aid to repair roads and bridges, water control facilities, public buildings, and recreation areas. The declaration was determined after the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) sent 20State Emergency Response Teams {{to determine the extent of}} damage. After Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, President Bush declared a disaster area for seven counties along the Florida panhandle on September6; the counties were Bay, Escambia, Franklin, Gulf, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa, and Walton. In addition, Collier County in southwestern Florida was added to the list of disaster areas.|$|E
5|$|After peak intensity, Gloria {{weakened}} while {{turning to}} the north, moving around {{the western end of}} the ridge, toward a cold front. By September 26, the winds had decreased to 90 mph (150 km/h), just 30 hours after its peak intensity. Later that day, a buoy about 60 mi (100 km) east of the center recorded a wave height of 46.9 ft (14.3 m), which at the time was the highest buoy wave recording in an Atlantic hurricane. While accelerating toward North Carolina, Gloria re-intensified slightly to winds of 105 mph (165 km/h), making it a Category 2 hurricane. At 0530 UTC on September 27, the hurricane struck southern Hatteras Island in the Outer Banks. After weakening further, Gloria passed just east of the Delmarva Peninsula and New Jersey and interacted with a cold front. Its strongest winds remained on {{the eastern edge of the}} circulation, and the storm was gradually losing tropical characteristics. At 1600 UTC on September 27, the hurricane made landfall with a broad and poorly defined center between John F. Kennedy International Airport and Islip, New York, with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) on western Long Island. This was only <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> after Henri struck the same general area as a much weaker tropical storm.|$|E

5|$|Saturn has an {{intrinsic}} magnetic field {{that has a}} simple, symmetric shape – a magnetic dipole. Its strength at the equator – 0.2gauss (20µT) – is approximately one twentieth of that of the field around Jupiter and slightly weaker than Earth's magnetic field. As a result, Saturn's magnetosphere is much smaller than Jupiter's. When Voyager 2 entered the magnetosphere, the solar wind pressure was high and the magnetosphere extended only 19 Saturn radii, or 1.1 million km (712,000mi), although it enlarged within several hours, and remained so for <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>days.</b> Most probably, the magnetic field is generated similarly to that of Jupiter – by currents in the liquid metallic-hydrogen layer called a metallic-hydrogen dynamo. This magnetosphere is efficient at deflecting the solar wind particles from the Sun. The moon Titan orbits within the outer part of Saturn's magnetosphere and contributes plasma from the ionized particles in Titan's outer atmosphere. Saturn's magnetosphere, like Earth's, produces aurorae.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia Emergency Management Agency was {{activated}} on September 15, <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> {{prior to}} Isabel making landfall and entering the state. Officials in Hampton issued the first mandatory evacuation {{in the state}} on September 17, about 35hours prior to landfall. Elevenhours later, a mandatory evacuation was issued for some residents in Chesapeake, Norfolk, and Virginia Beach, with a recommended evacuation for some residents {{in the city of}} Suffolk and Isle of Wight, Northumberland, Richmond, and York counties. Later on September 17 Governor Mark Warner provided authorization for all recommended evacuations to become mandatory. By the time Isabel entered Virginia late on September 18, evacuations were also issued for Accomack County, Chincoteague, Gloucester County, Lancaster County, Mathews County, Newport News, Poquoson, Portsmouth, and Westmoreland County. The zones ordered to evacuate included residents along waterfronts, in areas prone to flooding, potentially affected by storm surge from a Category 2 hurricane, low-lying areas, health care facilities, or islands. The tools officials used to determine the evacuation zones included shelter locations, the SLOSH storm surge model, evacuation maps, and clearance times.|$|E
5|$|Flooding was {{considered}} worst in Puebla, {{and were the}} worst floods in about 400years, according to newspaper reports. A total of 21,342people evacuated their houses to 116shelters, mostly in the state's northern portion. The floods affected 16,511houses and 199schools. In Teziutlán, {{with a population of}} about 50,000, it is estimated the city received nearly half of its annual rainfall in <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>days.</b> Nine entire communities became isolated due to the floods, and the small village of Patla sustained heavy damage after the Necaxa River changed its course closer to the town. Widespread landslides occurred, including over 80 in Teziutlán alone; one mudslide there destroyed 80houses. Some of the landslides occurred along rivers and produced new lakes, but 85% of these broke within the first year. Population growth, primarily in Teziutlán and Zaragoza, occurred in landslide-prone areas along mountains. Along Sierra Norte de Puebla, deforestation contributed to additional landslides. A landslide covered the Zacatepec River near Zempoala, creating a natural dam and a small lake. Mudslides buried at least 16people at a school in Pantepec, and a deforested hill caused a landslide in the Indigenous village of Acalama, which covered up to 170people. Most had fled to a church that was also covered, and it is estimated that only 30people survived in the village. Statewide, 263people were killed, including 107 in Teziutlán who were buried by mudslides, becoming the worst disaster {{in the history of the}} town. In the village of Tetela de Ocampo, 31people died. In Puebla, 30,000people were injured, and 81 municipalities sustained damage, with statewide damage estimated at about $240million (2.1billion pesos).|$|E

25|$|Some {{confusion}} {{was introduced}} when Smith and Allen suggested changing {{the name to}} erythermalgia in order to emphasise the symptoms of painful inflammation and warmth. In their paper they showed {{for the first time}} that when their patients used aspirin, this promptly relieved the burning pain for <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>days.</b> They also suggested a distinction between primary (idiopathic) erythromelalgia and secondary erythromelalgia (due to underlying neurologic, hematologic, or vascular problems).|$|E

25|$|The {{process begins}} by {{harvesting}} the plants, which can weigh 40kg each, extracting the piña, or heart, by {{cutting off the}} plant's leaves and roots. The piñas are then cooked for <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>days,</b> often in pit ovens, which are earthen mounds over pits of hot rocks. This underground roasting gives mezcal its intense and distinctive smoky flavor. They are then crushed and mashed (traditionally by a stone wheel turned by a horse) and then left to ferment in large vats or barrels with water added.|$|E
25|$|The {{life cycle}} of the Australian painted lady lasts around 53 days in the summer. The females lay eggs in {{the centre of the}} leaf of food plants. The eggs are green and hatch in <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>days.</b> As a caterpillar, the Australian painted lady is only active at night, during which its main {{activity}} is feeding. During the day, it hides in a curled leaf or {{at the foot of a}} food plant. The pupa hangs vertically from the underside of the leaf of a food plant, and the duration of the pupal stage is about two weeks.|$|E
