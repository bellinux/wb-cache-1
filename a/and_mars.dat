5|$|Terrestrials: Planets {{that are}} similar to Earth, with bodies largely {{composed}} of rock: Mercury, Venus, Earth <b>and</b> <b>Mars.</b> At 0.055 Earth masses, Mercury is the smallest terrestrial planet (and smallest planet) in the Solar System. Earth is the largest terrestrial planet.|$|E
5|$|The axial tilt of Jupiter is {{relatively}} small: only 3.13°. As a result, {{it does not}} experience significant seasonal changes, in contrast to, for example, Earth <b>and</b> <b>Mars.</b>|$|E
5|$|As Mars {{approaches}} opposition, {{it begins}} {{a period of}} retrograde motion, which means it will appear to move backwards in a looping motion {{with respect to the}} background stars. The duration of this retrograde motion lasts for about 72 days, <b>and</b> <b>Mars</b> reaches its peak luminosity {{in the middle of this}} motion.|$|E

5|$|Notable {{examples}} of river steamboats that were {{constructed by the}} Pittsburgh <b>and</b> <b>Mars</b> Works include the Franklin, the Aetna and the Pennsylvania. Another, christened the Oliver Evans but renamed the Constitution by its eventual owners, was lost along with the eleven crew members when its boiler exploded near Point Coupee, Louisiana. Evans was deeply distressed by the news, although he defended the safety of high-pressure engines and cited any explosions as an extremely rare occurrences.|$|E
5|$|Planets are {{generally}} {{divided into two}} main types: large low-density giant planets, and smaller rocky terrestrials. Under IAU definitions, there are eight planets in the Solar System. In order of increasing distance from the Sun, they are the four terrestrials, Mercury, Venus, Earth, <b>and</b> <b>Mars,</b> then the four giant planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Six of the planets are orbited {{by one or more}} natural satellites.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System is {{subdivided}} {{into the inner}} planets, the asteroid belt, and the outer planets. The inner terrestrial planets consist of Mercury, Venus, Earth, <b>and</b> <b>Mars.</b> The outer gas giant planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Beyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt, and finally the Oort Cloud, which may extend {{as far as a}} light-year.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{technology}} of Augmented Reality (AR) <b>and</b> mobile-Augmented Reality (<b>mAR)</b> in learning activities within tertiary education. We review some of the applications of AR <b>and</b> <b>mAR</b> utilised in education and learning simulations. We propose a framework for utilising educational AR <b>and</b> <b>mAR</b> in higher education. The framework features the occurrence of motivational issues which enhance and stimulate learners' understanding. The paper presents how the use of AR <b>and</b> <b>mAR</b> in higher education can transform the teaching method from instructional to student-centred learning. A description of how {{the use of such}} technologies act as learning resources for student-centred learning and its capability to effect learning outcomes is also described...|$|R
5|$|The Sun {{has eight}} known planets. This {{includes}} four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, <b>and</b> <b>Mars),</b> two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), and two ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). The Solar System also {{has at least}} five dwarf planets, an asteroid belt, numerous comets, {{and a large number}} of icy bodies which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune.|$|E
5|$|Two smaller low-gain antennas {{are also}} present for lower-rate {{communication}} during emergencies and special events, such as launch <b>and</b> <b>Mars</b> Orbit Insertion. These antennas {{do not have}} focusing dishes and can transmit and receive from any direction. They are an important backup system to ensure that MRO can always be reached, even if its main antenna is pointed away from the Earth.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1977 in {{downtown}} New York, punk rock was already ceding its cutting-edge status to the anarchic sound of Teenage Jesus and the Jerks <b>and</b> <b>Mars,</b> spearheads of {{what became known}} as no wave, although several original punk bands continued to perform and new ones emerged on the scene. The Cramps, whose core members were from Sacramento, California by way of Akron, had debuted at CBGB in November 1976, opening for the Dead Boys. They were soon playing regularly at Max's Kansas City. The Misfits formed in nearby New Jersey. Still developing what would become their signature B movie–inspired style, later dubbed horror punk, they made their first appearance at CBGB in April 1977.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the harsh}} environment, several life forms {{have been found}} that can {{withstand}} extreme space conditions for extended periods. Species of lichen carried on the ESA BIOPAN facility survived exposure for ten days in 2007. Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum germinated after being exposed to space for 1.5 years. A strain of bacillus subtilis has survived 559 days when exposed to low-Earth orbit or a simulated martian environment. The lithopanspermia hypothesis suggests that rocks ejected into outer space from life-harboring planets may successfully transport life forms to another habitable world. A conjecture is that just such a scenario occurred early {{in the history of}} the Solar System, with potentially microorganism-bearing rocks being exchanged between Venus, Earth, <b>and</b> <b>Mars.</b>|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field stops its atmosphere from being stripped {{away by the}} solar wind. Venus <b>and</b> <b>Mars</b> do not have {{magnetic field}}s, {{and as a result}} the solar wind is causing their atmospheres to gradually bleed away into space. Coronal mass ejections and similar events blow a magnetic field and huge quantities of material {{from the surface of the}} Sun. The interaction of this magnetic field and material with Earth's magnetic field funnels charged particles into Earth's upper atmosphere, where its interactions create aurorae seen near the magnetic poles.|$|E
5|$|Hannibal and Jupiter {{were sold}} in January 1920 and {{thereafter}} broken up in Italy and Britain, respectively. Illustrious followed her sisters to the breakers in June 1920, being scrapped at Barrow-in-Furness. Caesar was paid off in April 1920 and eventually sold for scrapping in Germany in July 1922. Magnificent <b>and</b> <b>Mars</b> were sold for scrap in May 1921 and broken up at Inverkeithing and Briton Ferry, respectively. Prince George was sold for scrapping in Germany in September, but while en route she ran aground off Camperduin. Victorious was renamed Indus II in 1920 and eventually sold for scrap in December 1922.|$|E

5|$|In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus {{published}} a heliocentric model {{in his work}} De revolutionibus orbium coelestium. This approach placed the Earth in an orbit around the Sun between the circular orbits of Venus <b>and</b> <b>Mars.</b> His model successfully explained why the planets Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were {{on the opposite side}} of the sky from the Sun whenever they were in the middle of their retrograde motions. Copernicus was able to sort the planets into their correct heliocentric order based solely on the period of their orbits about the Sun. His theory gradually gained acceptance among European astronomers, particularly after the publication of the Prutenic Tables by the German astronomer Erasmus Reinhold in 1551, which were computed using the Copernican model.|$|E
5|$|Mariner 9 and Viking allowed better maps of Mars to be {{made using}} the data from these missions, and another major leap forward was the Mars Global Surveyor mission, {{launched}} in 1996 and operated until late 2006, that allowed complete, extremely detailed maps of the Martian topography, magnetic field and surface minerals to be obtained. These maps are available online; for example, at Google Mars. Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter <b>and</b> <b>Mars</b> Express continued exploring with new instruments, and supporting lander missions. NASA provides two online tools: Mars Trek, which provides visualizations of the planet using data from 50 years of exploration, and Experience Curiosity, which simulates traveling on Mars in 3-D with Curiosity.|$|E
5|$|The axial tilt of Neptune is 28.32°, {{which is}} similar to the tilts of Earth (23°) <b>and</b> <b>Mars</b> (25°). As a result, Neptune {{experiences}} similar seasonal changes to Earth. The long orbital period of Neptune means that the seasons last for forty Earth years. Its sidereal rotation period (day) is roughly 16.11hours. Because its axial tilt is comparable to Earth's, the variation in the length of its day over the course of its long year is not any more extreme.|$|E

5|$|The four {{terrestrial}} or inner planets have dense, rocky compositions, {{few or no}} moons, and no ring systems. They {{are composed}} largely of refractory minerals, such as the silicates, which form their crusts and mantles, and metals, such as iron and nickel, which form their cores. Three of the four inner planets (Venus, Earth <b>and</b> <b>Mars)</b> have atmospheres substantial enough to generate weather; all have impact craters and tectonic surface features, such as rift valleys and volcanoes. The term inner planet {{should not be confused}} with inferior planet, which designates those planets that are closer to the Sun than Earth is (i.e. Mercury and Venus).|$|E
5|$|The inner Solar System {{has been}} made the goal of at least four {{unmanned}} programs. The first was Mariner in the 1960s and '70s, which made multiple visits to Venus <b>and</b> <b>Mars</b> and one to Mercury. Probes launched under the Mariner program were also the first to make a planetary flyby (Mariner 2), {{to take the first}} pictures from another planet (Mariner 4), the first planetary orbiter (Mariner 9), and the first to make a gravity assist maneuver (Mariner 10). This is a technique where the satellite takes advantage of the gravity and velocity of planets to reach its destination.|$|E
