It was completed {{towards the end of}} his life, between 1465 and 1470, and is held in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin. It marks a major stylistic advance in contemporary portraiture; the girl is set in an airy, three-dimensional, realistic setting, <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> out at the viewer with a complicated expression that is reserved, yet intelligent and alert.|$|E

5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with Utada entering a warehouse, and lifts a tarp off a hover cycle. As the camera pans away from the bike, Utada sits down and starts the bike. The first verse opens with Utada singing to the camera in a warehouse, whilst intercut scenes have her driving throughout Shibuya, Japan. As the verse progresses, two more clones of Utada appear and sing behind the original Utada. As the chorus starts, the hover cycle starts grinding against the road as she rides through small streets and corners. During the second verse, Utada stops through a city centre as shots of the clones appear on city billboards. She takes of her goggles, <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> at the moon, while close-up of the clone's faces are seen singing to the track.|$|E
5|$|Aslam and Khan confront {{one another}} as the police, having been alerted to Khan's {{location}} by a storekeeper, descend upon Dongri. Shoaib rains down blows and insults upon Aslam, urging him to defend {{himself in front of}} Jasmine. Nevertheless, Aslam, who still feels indebted and bound to Khan, does not fight back until Inspector Awant appears through the gathered crowd - even then, Aslam only pushes Khan away so that Khan is not shot by the officer. Reacting quickly, Khan draws a pistol of his own and shoots Awant before turning his weapon on Jasmine and Aslam. Jasmine, through tears and while holding a bleeding Aslam, tells Khan that he is truly evil and will never have her love. Khan seems to recognize the truth in her words as he drops his weapon <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> at the couple. Just then, more police officers arrive on the scene and open fire on Khan, who, now injured, is dragged away by one of his henchmen. He and Aslam, both alive but bloodied, lock eyes and reach out for another, having finally put aside their differences.|$|E

She tells him that just like {{everyone}} else in her life, he has failed to love only her. She cannot tolerate his feelings for anyone else, even his own son. She inserts needles into his eyes, giggling as she does so. She then cuts off his left foot with piano wire. Shigehiko returns home as Asami begins to cut off Aoyama's other foot, and she chases him upstairs. As she attacks the boy, Aoyama appears to suddenly wake up back in the hotel after he and Asami had sex, and his current ordeal seems to be only a nightmare; Aoyama proposes marriage and Asami accepts. As he falls back asleep in the hotel, he returns to find his son fighting back Asami, who is brandishing mace. Shigehiko kicks her downstairs, breaking her neck. Aoyama tells his son to call the police <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> at the dying Asami, who repeats what she said on one of their dates about her excitement on seeing him again.|$|E

In the opening scenes, as Walter Neff stumbles off the elevator {{on his way to}} his office to record his confession, the vast two-tiered office is empty and dark. With the camera following him, Neff lurches towards the balcony railing overlooking rows and rows of uniform corporate desks. Neff turns left, but the camera continues forward until it reaches the brink <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> down for an anxious moment into a colorless American business purgatory. Here, Pereira is said to have copied an existing office: the corporate headquarters of Paramount Pictures in New York City.|$|E

Voice recorder tests are conducted by Micah the following morning, which reveal demonic grunting when Micah asks if it would like to use a Ouija board. During the fifteenth night, Katie, in an apparent trance, stands beside the bed <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> at Micah for two hours before going outside.

Tim Byron of The Vine said {{the song is}} [...] "effective – the repeated lines {{at the start of the}} verses are catchy". Consequence of Sound's Kevin Barber described the song [...] "Mars sticks to the song’s name and insists that he wouldn’t want to change anything about his particular gal.You believe him, too.

After seeing herself as a goddess in Jerry's painting, Leslie starts responding when people nickname her Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, beauty and sexuality. While speaking to Ben, Tom describes his seduction ritual with women as turning the lights off with the Clapper, a sound-activated electrical light switch, and then putting on music by Boyz II Men, an R vocal group. This was previously demonstrated in the second-season finale [...] "Freddy Spaghetti", when the group's song [...] "On Bended Knee" [...] was playing while Tom has his girlfriend at his apartment.|$|E

[...] The sense of empathy triggers her to channel to Hermie some of her loneliness. She turns on the record player and invites Hermie to dance with her. They kiss and embrace, tears on both their faces. Without speaking, and to the sound only of the waves, they move to the bedroom, where she draws him into bed and gently makes love with him. Afterward, withdrawing again into her world of hurt, Dorothy retires to the porch, leaving Hermie alone in her bedroom. He approaches her on the porch, where she can only quietly say [...] "Good night, Hermie." [...] He leaves, his last image of Dorothy being of her leaning against the railing, as she smokes a cigarette <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> into the night sky.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Perch <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> is a {{maneuver}} where {{a vehicle}} flies to an overhead vantage point {{to provide a}} user with improved tactical information. This may include landing on rooftops, flying from rooftop to rooftop, or to windowsills all while carrying cameras or other intelligence gathering sensors. Miniature rotorcraft are ideal surveillance platforms, especially for perch <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> maneuvers because of their unique ability to take off and land vertically. Minimal vehicle size and weight also greatly enhance portability. Real world environmental influences such as fog, smoke, wind and cluttered or moving landing areas greatly complicate perch <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> maneuvers. This paper describes the application of optic flow and ultrasonic range finding sensors to increase miniature robotic rotorcraft autonomy for perch <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> maneuvers, especially in degraded environments...|$|R
500|$|In {{a review}} of FutureSex/LoveSounds, Ben Williams of New York cited the album's first five tracks, {{including}} [...] "FutureSex/LoveSound", as updating the early 1980s Minneapolis sound: [...] "tense drum machines, high-pitched synth squiggles and staccato funk bass lines". While reviewing the album, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic noted that the first three songs of the album include the word [...] "sex" [...] in their titles, [...] "as if mere repetition of the word will magically conjure a sex vibe, when in truth it has the opposite effect: it makes it seem that Justin is singing about it because he's not getting it." [...] Lucy Davies of BBC Music stated that it is initially [...] "difficult {{to listen to the}} lyrics of the opening tracks and give an objective opinion". She wrote that it is like Timberlake is [...] "trying to find redeemable qualities about some guy who has zero social skills <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> at women on his own from the corner of a bar. Only he seems to have found some similarly unreconstructed creepy friends shouting words of encouragement to his clunky chat-up lines, like Timbaland".|$|E

As he is above the tree, explosions and a cloud of black smoke emerge from the jungle. It confronts him whilst flashing images to him of his past. Mr. Eko stands his ground, despite Charlie telling him to run, <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> at the smoke before it pulls back and disappears. Eko and Charlie then find the plane, inside which Eko finds another corpse which Eko recognizes as Yemi. After taking the cross from Yemi's body, Eko tells Charlie that it is his brother, gives Charlie a Virgin Mary statue [...] "for the one [...] broke" [...] and sets the plane on fire. Charlie asks Eko if he is a priest himself, and as Eko puts the cross around his neck he replies [...] "Yes, I am." [...] The two then recite Psalm 23 from the Old Testament as the plane burns.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Smokin'" [...] was {{directed}} by Peter Gray and also appears on the DVD version of Songbook: The Singles, Vol. 1. The video begins with {{a shot of the}} Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appears {{on the cover of the}} Ice Hockey Hair EP. The logo fades out and the camera pans through a crowd of dark figures wearing berets towards a woman standing behind a long, black table. The woman is wearing a short sleeved black dress and has a blonde bob haircut. Her arms and face are illuminated in the otherwise dark room and she is shown walking backwards down the table, giving coloured cards to each of the figures wearing berets. The woman walks up and down the table observing the crowd as they each use the piece of card they were given to make an origami animal. As each person completes a model animal the woman gives them a new piece of coloured card. Approximately two minutes into the video the woman returns to a central position behind the table and looks down at one of the beret wearers. The camera cuts to show him screwing up a piece of green card into a ball which turns into an origami crane and flies away as he opens his hands. The rest of the figures in berets are shown from behind, bowing their heads before the camera cuts to a close up view of several origami animals on the table. These animals also begin to move, and interact with each other until a large red animal arrives. The camera cuts to a close-up of the red animal's head with smoke shown coming from its nose. The next shot shows the origami animals stationary on the table as the camera pans up to the beret wearers who are looking straight ahead while smoke moves across from the right. The woman walks up and down the table giving the beret wearers new pieces of card as they complete more and more origami animals. As the video draws to an end she rapidly piles up the origami animals into a heap in the middle of the table. When all the animals have been collected into the pile the beret wearers bow their heads and the woman puts her arms around the pile and smiles at the camera. In the final shot the woman places her hands on the table <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> at the camera as the video fades out to show the same Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appeared at the very beginning.|$|E
