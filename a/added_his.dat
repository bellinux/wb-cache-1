5|$|American Samoa held Australia {{scoreless}} for {{the first}} ten minutes of play until Con Boutsianis scored Australia's first goal from a corner kick.

5|$|At the French right flank, General Ferino {{attempted}} {{to push the}} Austrians back, first with a cannonade, followed by an attack through the woods {{on both sides of}} the road between Asch and Stockach. Two columns made two attacks, both of which were repulsed; finally, Ferino <b>added</b> <b>his</b> third column to the assault, which resulted in the Austrian reformation of the line, cannons at the center firing a heavy cannonade. Ferino could not respond because he had run out of artillery ammunition. The French fixed bayonets and charged the village of Wahlwies, successfully taking it, but they were unable to hold it in the night, and subsequently fell back.|$|E

James Harrison forced his first of two fumbles on the Patriots' next drive and the Steelers recovered as Reed <b>added</b> <b>his</b> third field goal of the game—putting the Steelers up 23–10. Gary Russell scored a touchdown after Lawrence Timmons returned an interception 89yards to the Patriots' one-yard line.|$|E

5|$|The former St John the Evangelist's Church {{was listed}} at Grade II on 20 August 1971. It is a Greek Revival-style stucco-clad {{building}} {{of stone and}} brick with a partly hipped roof. The three-bay façade has four Tuscan pilasters beneath a substantial entablature and pediment. The frieze between them has metopes and triglyphs. Work by L.A.

5|$|This was Arsenal's tenth Charity Shield {{appearance}} and Liverpool's ninth.

5|$|At a {{young age}} Saint-Just had shown a fascination with literature, and during his stay at the {{reformatory}} he used his time to begin writing a lengthy poem. He published it anonymously {{more than two years}} later, in May 1789, at the very outbreak of the Revolution. The 21-year-old Saint-Just thereby <b>added</b> <b>his</b> own touch to the social tumult of the times with Organt, poem in twenty cantos. The poem, a medieval epic fantasy, relates the quest of young Antoine Organt. It extols the virtues of primitive man, praising his libertinism and independence while blaming all present-day troubles on modern inequalities of wealth and power. Written in a style mimicking Ariosto, it gave a juvenile foreshadowing of his own political extremism. Spiked with brutal satire and scandalous pornographic episodes, it also made unmistakable attacks upon the monarchy, the nobility, and the Church.|$|E

5|$|Counterfeits and {{spurious}} {{reproductions of}} the 1804 dollar {{have been created}} since numismatists {{became aware of the}} coins' high value. James A. Bolen, a medallist and coin collector who created copies of valuable coins between 1862 and 1869, fabricated an 1804 dollar by altering the last digit in the date of a genuine 1803 example. Although Bolen <b>added</b> <b>his</b> name {{to the edge of the}} coin, other forgers created altered date coins with the intent to deceive. Nineteenth-century stage actor John T. Raymond purchased a specimen of the coin, which was later revealed to be a forgery, for $300. All silver dollars dated between 1800 and 1803 were subject to alteration to 1804 dollars, but 1801 was the date most commonly used for that purpose.|$|E
5|$|Dow {{continued}} to promote prohibition after leaving office, but also <b>added</b> <b>his</b> {{voice to the}} growing chorus advocating the abolition of slavery. Several slaveholding states seceded after the election of Republican presidential candidate Abraham Lincoln, and formed the Confederate States of America; even before {{the outbreak of the}} Civil War, Dow called for the rebellion to be crushed and slavery abolished. He was 57 years old at the outbreak of the war, and determined to stay home and tend to his business and care for his aging father. After the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter, however, Dow felt compelled to join the Union cause. Governor Israel Washburn appointed him Colonel of the 13th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment on November 23, 1861. Many of the officers Dow recruited to the cause were his associates from the prohibition movement.|$|E
5|$|Fownes {{was born}} into a family {{belonging}} to Devon's gentry and led the life of a country squire. In 1747, he married Margaret Luttrell, the heiress of Dunster Castle and <b>added</b> <b>his</b> wife's name to his own to comply with her late father's will. In accordance with the era's laws concerning the property rights of married women, on his marriage he became the legal owner of his wife's property, including not only Dunster Castle, but also the lordships of the manors of Dunster, Heathfield, and Kilton amongst others. The newly named Fownes Luttrell altered the castle considerably, remodelling its interior and park and building the Conygar Tower, a folly in the grounds. Following the death of his wife in 1766 he remarried in 1771.|$|E

5|$|From January 1996 onwards, Ranariddh's {{relations}} with Hun Sen {{began to show}} signs of tension. Hun Sen submitted a government circular to reinstate 7 January as a national holiday, the anniversary of Phnom Penh's liberation from the Khmer Rouge by Vietnamese forces. Ranariddh <b>added</b> <b>his</b> signature to the circular, which incurred the ire of Sihanouk and several FUNCINPEC leaders. A few days later, apparently to tone down dissatisfaction from party members, Ranariddh publicly accused the Army of Vietnam of encroaching into the territories of four Cambodian provinces bordering it. As Widyono saw it, Ranariddh intended to test Hun Sen's response to his accusations, of which the latter chose to remain quiet. During a closed-door FUNCINPEC meeting in the later part of January 1996, party members criticised Hun Sen and the CPP for monopolizing government power, and also chided Ranariddh for being too subservient to Hun Sen.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, while Miller and Colmesnil {{were busy}} with their {{entry in the}} {{competition}} to redesign San Francisco City Hall {{as well as with}} the design of many new hotels, apartments and private homes, Timothy L. Pflueger was given the opportunity to serve as chief architect on a rural church project funded by The Family, a club to which Miller belonged. Pflueger designed Our Lady of the Wayside Church with a main theme of Spanish Mission Revival based on his childhood familiarity with Mission San Francisco de Asís (locally known as Mission Dolores) but <b>added</b> <b>his</b> own personal statement: a striking Georgian main entrance topped by a scrolled pediment. After working with sub-contractor members of The Family on the project, Pflueger joined the club himself. The rural church was declared California Historical Landmark number 909 in 1977.|$|E
5|$|In {{the week}} after the season had finished, Barry Conlon {{was the first to}} sign a new deal keeping him at the club until January 2008, before Kyle Nix and Luke O'Brien signed their season-long contracts. By the end of the week, McCall made his first {{transfer}} of the summer when he signed goalkeeper Jonathan McLaughlin from non-league Harrogate Town. It was not {{until the end of the}} month that he <b>added</b> <b>his</b> second signing, when midfielder Chris Brandon, a former club trainee, joined from Huddersfield Town on a free transfer. Defender Paul Arnison, who had been released by Carlisle United in May, became the club's third summer transfer, when he signed a two-year contract on 18 June 2008. On 30 June 2008, the final day before City would return to pre-season training, City signed a second defender, when Graeme Lee joined on a free transfer from Doncaster Rovers. He also signed a two-year contract.|$|E
