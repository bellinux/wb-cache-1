5|$|In 2005, Faisalabad was reorganised {{as a city}} {{district}} {{composed of}} eight Tehsil municipal administrations (TMAs). The functions of the TMA include preparation of the spatial and land use plans, management of these development plans and exercise of control over land use, land sub-division, land development <b>and</b> <b>zoning</b> by public and private sectors, enforcement of municipal laws, rules and by-laws, provision and management of water, drainage waste and sanitation along with allied municipal services.|$|E

5|$|Subsequently, {{commercial}} development <b>and</b> <b>zoning</b> spread along King Street and its cross streets. After several decades of decline, King Street {{has experienced a}} revival since 2005 following a successful streetscaping project. A popular beer bar that opened that year {{set the tone for}} later establishments, many of them craft beer oriented. Subsequently, the district has become the home of many bars, restaurants, stores, and night clubs, as well as an arts district and two craft breweries to the north. As a result of this growth, the King Street District emerged as Jacksonville's beer hub in the 2010s.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} to {{investigate}} the effects of the combination of deoxynivalenol (DON) <b>and</b> zearalenone (<b>ZON)</b> on pigs. Twenty-four weaning piglets were divided into a control group fed a diet free of mycotoxins and a toxin group fed a diet containing 1 mg/kg DON <b>and</b> 250 µg/kg <b>ZON.</b> The results showed that supplementation of DON <b>and</b> <b>ZON</b> in diets had extensive effects on pigs. More specifically, DON <b>and</b> <b>ZON</b> caused levels of total protein, albumin, and globulin in sera to decrease (p < 0. 05) by 14. 5 %, 6. 5 % and 11. 3 %, respectively, {{and at the same time}} increased (p < 0. 05) the serum enzyme activities of γ-glutamyltransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase by 72. 0 %, 32. 6 % and 36. 6 %, respectively. In addition, DON <b>and</b> <b>ZON</b> decreased (p < 0. 05) the level of anti-classical swine fever antibody titers by 14. 8 %. Real-time PCR showed that DON <b>and</b> <b>ZON</b> caused the mRNA expression levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL- 2, to decrease (p < 0. 05) by 36. 0 %, 29. 0 % and 35. 4 %, respectively. Histopathological studies demonstrated that DON <b>and</b> <b>ZON</b> caused abnormalities in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, uterus, and kidney. The concentrations of DON <b>and</b> <b>ZON</b> used in this study are in line with the published critical values permitted by BML. Our study clearly put the standard and adequacy of safety measures for these toxins into question. The authors suggest that with the increasing availability of cellular and molecular technologies, it is time to revisit the safety standards for toxins in feeds so as to make feeds safer, providing consumers with safer products...|$|R

5|$|Since the 1755 earthquake, Boston and its {{surrounding}} towns have become a major metropolitan area. Much new construction has been built on infill, especially in the Back Bay area, which may be prone to greater shaking and to compaction of the sand and gravel used as fill. Many older buildings in the Boston area are built from stone and brick, {{and are likely to}} collapse completely during a major earthquake. Given this, modern observers have expressed concern about the effects of another quake in such a major city. A 1990 study by the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency estimated potential financial losses at between $4 billion and $5 billion, and potential loss of life in the hundreds. As a consequence, the state has updated building codes <b>and</b> <b>zoning</b> laws to require that new construction and additions in vulnerable areas be built to resist earthquakes.|$|E

40|$|Deoxynivalenol (DON) <b>and</b> {{zearalenone}} (<b>ZON)</b> are mycotoxins frequently {{detected in}} Fusarium -infected cereal grain. Both toxins {{are produced by}} Fusarium culmorum and F. graminearum during the development of Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) disease. We are developing tools {{to allow us to}} simultaneously detect DON <b>and</b> <b>ZON</b> production by Fusarium species. We generated a transgenic F. culmorum strain that expresses fluorescent proteins under the control of promoters of genes that are essential for the biosynthesis of DON (trichodiene synthase; Tri 5) <b>and</b> <b>ZON</b> (a promoter that drives two polyketide synthetases, Zea 1 and Zea 2). We developed a duplex real time PCR assays for the concurrent analysis of Zea 1 and Tri 4 (another gene essential for DON production). We are currently generating a multiplex real time PCR version of this assay to detect Zea 1, Tri 4 and a plant actin (Act 1) gene. This assay can be used to detect DON <b>and</b> <b>ZON</b> producers in grain; Act 1 serves as a positive control plant gene in the reaction. We are also developing a multiplex real time RT-PCR assay to detect Zea 1, Tri 4 and a F. culmorum/F. graminearum beta-tubulin (Btub) gene. Incorporation of the Btub enables normalization of Tri 4 and Zea 1 transcript expression, relative to fungal abundance...|$|R

Preliminary analysis of fungal potential {{for the production of}} DON <b>and</b> <b>ZON</b> were performed by the modified rapid screening method of F i l t e n b o r g et al. (1983). Dynamics of DON <b>and</b> <b>ZON</b> biosynthesis was tested under different condi-tions of isolate cultivation: (i) in a basic liquid semi-synthetic medium with 2 % yeast extract and 15 % sucrose, pH 6. 5 (YES), (ii) in broth with same concentrations of yeast extract and sucrose supplemented with 0. 23 mg/l ZnSO 4 x 5 H 2 O, pH 6. 5 (YESZn) and (iii) on natural solid substrates such as wet sterilized maize and rice kernels.
