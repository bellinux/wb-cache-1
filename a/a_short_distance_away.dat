5|$|A grave found <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>away</b> also {{contained}} jewellery, including a gold pendant, silver brooch, and glass beads. It {{is thought that}} the occupant {{may have had a}} close connection with the woman in the bed burial– perhaps a relative or a lady-in-waiting who was buried with her mistress.|$|E

5|$|Norwich Market (also {{known as}} Norwich Provision Market) is an outdoor market {{consisting}} of around 200stalls in central Norwich, England. Founded {{in the latter}} part of the 11thcentury to supply Norman merchants and settlers moving to the area following the Norman conquest of England, it replaced an earlier market <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>away.</b> It has been in operation on the present site for over 900years.|$|E
5|$|The {{site of the}} observatory, which {{includes}} the Jodrell Bank Visitor Centre and an arboretum, {{is located in the}} civil parish of Lower Withington (the rest being in Goostrey civil parish), near Goostrey and Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, North West England. It is reached from the A535. The telescope can be seen when travelling by train, as the Crewe to Manchester Line passes right by the site, with Goostrey station <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E

50|$|Komodo dragons avoid {{encounters}} with humans. Juveniles are very shy and will flee quickly into a hideout if a human comes closer than about 100 m. Older animals will also retreat from humans from <b>a</b> <b>shorter</b> <b>distance</b> <b>away.</b> If cornered, they will react aggressively by gaping their mouth, hissing, and swinging their tail. If they are disturbed further, they may start an attack and bite. Although there are anecdotes of unprovoked Komodo dragons attacking or preying on humans, {{most of these}} reports are either not reputable or caused by defensive bites. Only a very few cases are truly the result of unprovoked attacks by abnormal individuals, which lost their fear towards humans.|$|R
5|$|Cupid conceals himself, as Theseus and Ariadne {{arrive on}} the island <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>away.</b> Ariadne muses over her disloyalty to her father, but {{declares}} her love for Theseus. She departs to find shelter for the night, after which a fishermen's chorus compares her eyes with the stars of heaven. Theseus, alone with his counsellor, discusses his abandonment of Ariadne, and is advised that this decision is justified, as {{she will not be}} acceptable to the people of Athens as their ruler's consort.|$|E
5|$|Route958 {{was first}} {{designated}} among many regional highways in the 1928 mass renumbering of state highways throughout Pennsylvania. The alignment, however {{was only a}} stub designation, connecting the southern terminus of U.S. Route6 (formerly State Route7) to the borough of Wrightsville, only <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>away.</b> The alignment designed in 1928 only remained intact eight years into 1936, when it was extended northward to its current terminus at the New York state line near Bear Lake, Pennsylvania and Niobe, New York in 1936. The alignment has remained unchanged since the 1936 extension.|$|E
5|$|The lake {{is located}} in the {{approximate}} geographic centre of the city, and is the centrepiece of the capital in accordance with Griffin's original designs. Numerous important institutions, such as the National Gallery, National Museum, National Library, Australian National University and the High Court were built on its shores, and Parliament House is <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>away.</b> Its surrounds, consisting mainly of parklands, are popular with recreational users, particularly in the warmer months. Though swimming in the lake is uncommon, it is used {{for a wide variety of}} other activities, such as rowing, fishing, and sailing.|$|E
50|$|Keikyū Kawasaki Station (Keikyū Kawasaki-eki) is {{a railway}} station in Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan, {{operated}} by the private railway operator Keikyu Corporation.

50|$|Cormoran (sometimes Cormilan, Cormelian, Gormillan, or Gourmaillon) is {{the first}} giant slain by Jack. Cormoran and his wife, the giantess Cormelian, are {{particularly}} associated with St Michael's Mount, apparently an ancient pre-Christian site of worship. According to Cornish legend, the couple were responsible for its construction by carrying granite from the West Penwith Moors to the current location of the Mount. When Cormoran fell asleep from exhaustion, his wife tried to sneak a greenschist slab from <b>a</b> <b>shorter</b> <b>distance</b> <b>away.</b> Cormoran awoke and kicked the stone out of her apron, where it fell to form the island of Chapel Rock. Trecobben, the giant of Trencrom Hill (near St Ives), accidentally killed Cormelian when he threw a hammer over to the Mount for Cormoran's use. The giantess was buried beneath Chapel Rock.|$|R
60|$|Ralph, {{seeing that}} at this point even Bob was willing to admit that there might be some danger in the work he was doing, {{proposed}} to George that they move <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> further <b>away,</b> lest there should be an accident, and the reply he received was not well calculated to soothe his nervousness.|$|R
5|$|The {{notes were}} handed to two {{horsemen}} who were standing by. The Manchester and Salford Yeomanry were stationed just <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>away</b> in Portland Street, and so received their note first. They immediately drew their swords and galloped towards St Peter's Field. One trooper, in a frantic attempt to catch up, knocked down {{a woman in}} Cooper Street, causing {{the death of her}} son when he was thrown from her arms; two-year-old William Fildes was the first casualty of Peterloo.|$|E
5|$|Crawford and Knight {{were taken}} to Wingenund's camp on June 7, where they found nine other prisoners. On June 11, Captain Pipe painted {{the faces of the}} prisoners black, the {{traditional}} sign they were to be executed. The prisoners were marched to the Delaware town on Tymochtee Creek, near the present-day village of Crawford, Ohio. Four prisoners were killed with tomahawks and scalped along the way. When the war party stopped, the seven remaining prisoners were made to sit, with Crawford and Knight <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>away</b> from the others. Delaware women and boys killed the other five with tomahawks, beheading one of them. The boys scalped the victims and slapped the bloody scalps in the faces of Crawford and Knight.|$|E
5|$|Cummings {{explored}} the Richardsonian Romanesque mode {{in several of}} his buildings at Russell Sage. The Paine Mansion at 49 Second Street applied the same style, with arcaded entrance loggia and corner tower, to a home. The brick drugstore annex at 155-157 River Street is a particularly representative commercial example of the style. In 1893 the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago popularized the Classical and Renaissance revivals and Beaux-Arts style. They came to Troy very quickly when Marcus Cummings and his son Frederick designed the Classical Revival county courthouse at 80 Second Street, the third to occupy the site, the following year. <b>A</b> <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>away</b> three years later, the Renaissance Revival Hart Memorial Library was built of Vermont marble, joining the similarly styled 1895 Frear Mansion, also on Second Street.|$|E
50|$|San Luis Obispo {{is home to}} California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly), {{a public}} {{university}} enrolling nearly 26,000 students. The school is just outside city limits and provides on-campus housing for nearly 6,000 freshmen and sophomores. The area is also served by Cuesta College, a community college <b>a</b> <b>short</b> driving <b>distance</b> <b>away.</b>|$|R
50|$|Toast is a tongue-in-cheek {{celebration of}} {{the virtues of the}} wine from the small town of Orbaneja del Castillo. The sonnet was printed {{on the back of the}} menu at a {{restaurant}} in Madrid located <b>a</b> <b>short</b> walking <b>distance</b> <b>away</b> from Primo de Rivera's law office; very possibly the restaurant where he ate lunch.|$|R
50|$|Ashburn Farm holds three {{swimming}} pools, Windmill Pool, Breezyhill Pool, and Summerwood Pool {{and clubs}} throughout its area. There are also many trails and two parks. The Ashburn Regional Library is also {{located in the}} community.

5|$|Investigators {{believed}} the aircraft captain survived {{for a short}} time after the crash. His body was <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>away</b> from his seat and both were a few metres ahead of the wreckage where they had been thrown after the nose of the aircraft was split open in the impact with a large tree. The seat belt had not broken, but it had been undone. The captain's tunic was pulled up over his head as though to protect his face from the heat of the nearby inferno. Investigators believed he survived the crash and undid his seat belt to drag himself away from the fire. His body was not burnt, but autopsy showed both his legs were broken and he died from a fractured skull.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneous {{with their}} attack at Ka-san, UN and North Korean units were {{similarly}} deadlocked <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>away</b> in the Battle of Tabu-dong. In that sector, NK Major Kim Song Jun of the NK 19th Regiment, NK 13th Division had defected to the UN troops on September 1. He {{reported that a}} full-scale North Korean attack was to begin at dusk that day. The NK 13th Division, he said, had just taken in 4,000 replacements, 2,000 of them without weapons, and was now back to a strength of approximately 9,000 men. Upon receiving this intelligence, 1st Cavalry Division commander Major General Hobart R. Gay alerted all of his division's front-line units {{to be prepared for}} the attack. ROK 1st Division commander Major General Paik Sun Yup also braced his men for attack.|$|E
5|$|The Italians {{were under}} the {{impression}} that they were facing three Belgian divisions with South African reinforcements. They also only had about two months' provisions left. Gazzera radioed the Allies in Addis Abeba his intentions to negotiate a surrender with the Belgians. The Belgians were preparing for another assault when at 13:40 two staff cars bearing white flags drove down the mountain. In them were eight Italian generals, a catholic priest and Gazzera's chief of staff. Gilliaert met with them <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>away</b> from Bortai Brook near Gambela. They requested that all hostilities south of the Blue Nile cease and that their army be granted the honours of war. Gilliaert accepted and on 6 July he drove into Saïo to receive the formal surrender of the Italian forces.|$|E
5000|$|This was a large, Gothic estate {{built upon}} the beach near Widow's Hill. It is located <b>a</b> very <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>away</b> from the equally {{impressive}} Collinwood estate {{and a small}} footpath existed connecting the two properties together. A mariner named Captain Cranshaw built the house {{some time in the}} 1800s. (Note: This relates to continuity established by the Marilyn Ross novels.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Arnhem {{bridge was}} not the only Rhine crossing. Had the Market Garden {{planners}} realized that a ferry was available at Driel, the British might have secured that instead of the Arnhem bridge. Being <b>a</b> <b>shorter</b> <b>distance</b> <b>away</b> from their western drop and landing zones, the 1st Parachute Brigade could have concentrated to hold the Oosterbeek heights, instead of one battalion farther away at the road bridge; in this case, Arnhem was [...] "one bridge too many". A contrasting view is that the attack into Arnhem was intended to capture the rail bridge, the pontoon bridge and the road bridge; that the rail bridge was blown in the face of Frost's 2nd Parachute Battalion, the pontoon bridge had been disabled by the removal of several sections and that this left only the road bridge intact, the Heveadorp ferry was no substitute for a bridge.|$|R

5|$|The {{battle was}} fought at the {{location}} of the modern city of San Lorenzo, Santa Fe which is next to the Paraná River, at the point of its widest flow. The west bank of the river was tall and steep, forming a natural obstacle, and ships could only land troops and materials {{on that side of the}} river using man-made paths cut into the side. The battlefield was near one of these paths, shaped like a ladder, after which the terrain was a big plain with scattered bushes. The San Carlos Convent, the main nearby building, was <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>away</b> from the river.|$|E
5|$|William Bryan and {{his wife}} donated land and built a school at nearby Glenore in 1862. The Bryans left a bequest that fully funded the school until 1914, when the state's {{education}} department assumed responsibility for {{the building and the}} teacher's salary. By 1921 56 students were attending. The building had been condemned by 1926 and a new brick school building was built <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>away.</b> Following a direction by Mrs Bryan in her bequest, the school was used at times for religious services, by Methodists and Anglicans. Due to low attendance the school was closed in 1941 and the few remaining pupils continued schooling at Whitemore.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{arrived at}} Maracaibo {{to find the}} city largely deserted, its {{residents}} having been forewarned of his approach by the fortress's troops. He spent three weeks in the city, ransacking and plundering what he could. Privateers searched the surrounding jungle to find the escapees; they, {{and some of the}} remaining occupants, were tortured to find where money or treasure had been hidden. Satisfied he had stolen all he could, he sailed south across Lake Maracaibo, to Gibraltar. The town's occupants refused to surrender, and the fort fired enough of a barrage to ensure Morgan kept his distance. He anchored <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>away</b> and his men landed by canoe and assaulted the town from the landward approach. He met scant resistance, as many of the occupants had fled into the surrounding jungle. He spent five weeks in Gibraltar, and there was again evidence that torture was used to force residents to reveal hidden money and valuables.|$|E
2500|$|The Wharncliffe Viaduct is a brick-built viaduct {{that carries}} the Great Western Main Line railway across the Brent Valley, between Hanwell and Southall, Ealing, UK, at an {{elevation}} of [...] The viaduct, built in 1836–7, was constructed {{for the opening of}} the Great Western Railway (GWR).
