25|$|In {{the fall}} of 2006, IBM {{released}} the QS20 blade module using double Cell BE processors for tremendous performance in certain applications, reaching a peak of 410gigaFLOPS in FP8 quarter precision per module. The QS22 based on the PowerXCell 8i processor {{is used for the}} IBM Roadrunner supercomputer. Mercury and IBM uses the fully utilized Cell processor with eight active SPEs. On April 8, 2008, Fixstars Corporation released a PCI Express <b>accelerator</b> <b>board</b> based on the PowerXCell 8i processor.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} {{commercial}} application of Cell was in Sony's PlayStation 3 game console. Mercury Computer Systems has a dual Cell server, a dual Cell blade configuration, a rugged computer, and a PCI Express <b>accelerator</b> <b>board</b> available in {{different stages of}} production. Toshiba had announced plans to incorporate Cell in high definition television sets, but seems to have abandoned the idea. Exotic features such as the XDR memory subsystem and coherent Element Interconnect Bus (EIB) interconnect appear to position Cell for future applications in the supercomputing space to exploit the Cell processor's prowess in floating point kernels.|$|E

50|$|There is no {{detailed}} information about how many PowerPC <b>accelerator</b> <b>boards</b> Phase5 (and later DCE) sold. According to Ralph Schmidt in an AmigActive article featuring MorphOS, there were about 10,000 people using Phase5 PowerPC <b>accelerator</b> <b>boards.</b> The unofficial PowerUP support page estimates similar figures.|$|R
50|$|AmigaOS 4.0 for Amigas {{equipped}} with PowerUP <b>accelerator</b> <b>boards</b> {{was released in}} November 2007. Version 4.1 was released in August 2008 for AmigaOne systems, and in May 2011 for Amigas {{equipped with}} PowerUP <b>accelerator</b> <b>boards.</b> The most recent release of AmigaOS for all supported platforms is 4.1 update 5. Starting with release 4.1 update 4 there is an Emulation drawer containing official AmigaOS 3.x ROMs (all classic Amiga models including CD32) and relative Workbench files.|$|R
50|$|The {{new version}} is PowerPC-native, finally abandoning the Motorola 68k processor. AmigaOS 4.0 will run on some PowerPC hardware, which {{currently}} only includes A1200, A3000 and A4000 with PowerPC <b>accelerator</b> <b>boards</b> and AmigaOne motherboards. Amiga, Inc.'s distribution policies for AmigaOS 4.0 and any later versions require that for third-party hardware the OS must be bundled with it, {{with the sole}} exception of Amigas with Phase 5 PowerPC <b>accelerator</b> <b>boards,</b> for which the OS will be sold separately.|$|R
50|$|This <b>accelerator</b> <b>board</b> was {{designed}} for Amiga 3000 and Amiga 4000. The <b>accelerator</b> <b>board</b> was famous for its high performance due to its 64 bit wide memory bus and PowerPC 604e processor. According to Phase 5 it could sustain memory transfers up to 68 MB/s on the 68060 and up to 160 MB/s on the 604e.|$|E

50|$|PowerUP kernel is a {{multitasking}} kernel {{developed by}} Ralph Schmidt for Phase5 PowerPC <b>accelerator</b> <b>boards.</b> The kernel ran alongside the AmigaOS where PPC and 68k native software could run parallel.|$|R
50|$|PowerUP boards were dual-processor 68k-PowerPC <b>accelerator</b> <b>boards</b> {{designed}} by Phase5 Digital Products for Amiga computers. They had two different processors working in parallel, sharing the complete address {{space of the}} Amiga computer system.|$|R
40|$|Reconfigurable {{hardware}} {{resources are}} very expensive, and yet can be underutilized. This paper describes a middleware capable of discovering underutilized computing nodes with FPGA-based <b>accelerator</b> <b>boards</b> in a networked environment. Using an extended Job management system (JMS), this middleware permits sharing reconfigurable resources {{at least among}} the members of the same organization. Traditional resources, such as CPU time of loosely coupled workstations can be shared using a variety of existing Job Management Systems (JMSs). We analyzed four of these systems, LSF, Sun Grid Engine / CODINE, PBS Pro, and Condor {{from the point of view}} of their functional characteristics and ease of extension to support reconfigurable hardware. LSF was shown to efficiently address the majority of identified requirements. The general architecture of the extended system was developed, and the exact techniques of extending LSF, CODINE, and PBS Pro to manage FPGA-based <b>accelerator</b> <b>boards</b> were identified. The system architecture was verified experimentally for the specific case of LSF and three types of FPGA <b>accelerator</b> <b>boards.</b> The utilization of FPGA boards was demonstrated to reach up to 86 % in our experimental setting consistin...|$|R

50|$|Phase5 {{implemented}} ELF executables for its PowerUP <b>accelerator</b> <b>boards.</b> It {{was found}} cumbersome {{due to its}} dynamic linking. This format was then adopted as standard by AmigaOS 4.0, MorphOS and AROS. ELF support was added to WarpUp by 3rd party developers and Hyperion Entertainment released number of WarpUp games in ELF format only.|$|R
50|$|Another {{product for}} the Amiga {{platform}} is the WarpOS {{which is a}} multi-tasking kernel for the PowerPC architecture developed by Haage & Partner in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

50|$|The CPU card, called Eltanin, {{was based}} on the Warp Engine Amiga <b>accelerator</b> <b>board.</b> It {{featured}} a 68060 processor with FPU and MMU at 50 MHz and on some special models it used a 68040.|$|E

40|$|Distributed {{reconfigurable}} resources, such as FPGA-based <b>accelerator</b> <b>boards</b> 1 {{are expensive}} and often underutilized.

Traditional resources, such as CPU time of loosely coupled workstations can be shared using a variety of existing distributed computing systems. We analyzed twelve of these systems, and chose five of them, belonging to the class of Job Management Systems with a Central Job Schedular, as most suitable for extension to reconfigurable hardware. These five systems, LSF, CODINE, PBS, Condor, and RES, were further compared based on their functional characteristics and ease of extension. LSF was shown to be superior according to the majority of the 25 identified requirements.

Single-field resolutions were AVR 1 through 9s; interlaced (finishing) resolutions were initially AVR 21-23, with the later improvements of AVR 24 through 27, and the later AVR 70 through 77. AVR12 was a two-field interlaced offline resolution. Additionally, Avid marketed the Media Composer 400 and 800 as offline-only editors.
