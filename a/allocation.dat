5|$|Both clubs {{received}} an <b>allocation</b> of approximately 25,000 tickets, {{fewer than the}} 32,000 received for the semi-finals. The <b>allocation</b> was enough for the 21,000 Stoke City season ticket holders, but not for Manchester City's 36,000 season ticket holders. Consequently, some supporters felt aggrieved {{at the lack of}} tickets, including Stoke City chairman Peter Coates who expressed his disappointment and suggested an <b>allocation</b> in the region of 30,000 for both clubs. Ticket prices for the final exceeded £100 for the first time. The most expensive tickets cost £115, an increase of 22percent on the previous season.

The remaining seats are accounted for by Hampden Park debenture holders, hospitality, sponsors, media and segregation areas. In excess of 1,000 unused debentures were distributed to each club. The <b>allocation</b> was enough to provide for the season ticket holders of each club, with Hearts having 10,000 and Hibs 7,500 approximately, although both clubs anticipated that there would be little or no need for a general public sale. Hearts decided to sell tickets using their loyalty points system, while Hibs connected their <b>allocation</b> to sales of season tickets and memberships. Due to high demand, Hearts tightened the criteria needed for a ticket during the sales process. Regular tickets cost £35 or £28 for adults and £10 for children under 15 years old.|$|E
