5|$|The Legend of Zelda: <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> Between Worlds is an action-adventure game {{presented}} in stereoscopic 3D polygonal graphics, with gameplay predominantly experienced from a top-down perspective. Players control {{a young boy}} named Link, who embarks on an adventure to rescue the Seven Sages and defeat Yuga, the game's primary antagonist. The game is set in two kingdoms—Hyrule and Lorule—both of which bear an open world structure and similar layout, but contrast in style and tone. <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> Between Worlds {{is seen as a}} successor to the 1991 Super Nintendo Entertainment System title , and is similar in many aspects. The worlds of Hyrule and Lorule in <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> Between Worlds are analogous to <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> to the Pasts depiction of Hyrule and the Dark World. A number of items, enemies, and audio tracks featured in <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> to the Past return in <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> Between Worlds.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Link</b> Between Worlds {{features}} original music {{along with}} tracks from <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> to the Past. Ryo Nagamatsu composed and orchestrated new music for <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> Between Worlds, {{and played the}} flute music featured in the game's milk bar. He also composed arrangements and adapted Koji Kondo's original music from <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> to the Past. Nagamatsu wanted to balance arrangements of past music with completely new music to please both old and new players. He began by revisiting old tracks and thinking how he could best adapt them for <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> Between Worlds soundtrack. He was eager to include choral performances {{as a way to}} add tension to the eerie and unpleasant scenes in the game. Nagamatsu performed the vocals and made use of multitrack recording to layer the different vocals tracks. The audio team decided not use a live orchestra for recording the game's music, the primary reason for this was to create optimal sound for the Nintendo 3DS. The reverberations and low-pitch sounds created by a live orchestra were not suitable for the Nintendo 3DS speakers. The majority of the string music was created using a synthesizer, with Toru Minegishi playing guitar on one track.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Link</b> to the Past {{is one of}} {{the best-selling}} SNES games, with 4.61 million units sold worldwide, and has had an {{exceptionally}} long stay on Nintendo Powers top games list (ranking number 2 in Nintendo Power's last issue in December 2012): when the SNES list was finally retired, <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> to the Past had more than five consecutive years in the number one spot. It was re-released as a Player's Choice title in North America, indicating that it has sold a minimum of one million copies there. In the United States, <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> to the Pasts Game Boy Advance version alone sold 1.4 million copies and earned $41 million by August 2006. During the period between January 2000 and August 2006, it was the 8th highest-selling game launched for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS or PlayStation Portable in that country.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the {{existence}} of <b>a</b> <b>linking</b> morpheme is not related to recursion of compounds in the given language, but <b>a</b> <b>linking</b> morpheme does play a role in some ways or the other of recursion. Recursion of compounding is defined as embedding at the edge or in the center of an action or object of an instance of the same type. On the other hand, iteration, is simply unembedded repetition of an action or object (Bisetto 2010). Based on these definitions, it is argued that there are languages with <b>a</b> <b>linking</b> morpheme overtly realized in recursive languages. Second, there are also languages which have genitive compounds with <b>a</b> <b>linking</b> morpheme, although recursive compounds do not have <b>a</b> <b>linking</b> morpheme. On the other hand, there are languages with a genitive compounds and recursive compounds of coordinate VNN or nominal coordinate compounds. In these languages, recursive compounds are not so productive. Finally, Turkish and Greek show {{that the existence of}} <b>a</b> <b>linking</b> morpheme is not related to recursion of compounds. They have <b>a</b> <b>linking</b> morpheme in iterated compounds, but not in recursive compounds. </p...|$|R

5|$|Reviewers {{agreed that}} <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> Between Worlds excelled at {{making use of}} the console's 3D capabilities. However, the game's art {{direction}} was divisive among critics, with some writers expressing dislike for the graphics, and others calling the visuals gorgeous. The game's music composition was complimented; Ryckert called the game's soundtrack {{one of the best}} in gaming, and Veloria thought it was some of the best in the series, praising both the new compositions and the adapted renditions music from <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> to the Past.|$|E

5|$|The {{designers}} {{thought that}} Link's appearance should change when Link entered {{a wall and}} the perspective switched from a top-down view to side view. They chose to make Link a mural {{while he was on}} a wall; this {{led to the creation of}} Yuga, the game's antagonist, a sorcerer that can transform himself and others into paintings. Aonuma mentioned that the idea of Link turning into a mural was inspired by Phantom Ganon jumping into paintings during his encounter in Ocarina of Time. As the game's story takes place long after the events of a <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> to the Past and the player travels between the two worlds of Hyrule and Lorule, the development team chose <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> Between Worlds instead of <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> to the Past 2 for the game's English-language title.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} verify the above notion, we {{modified}} PRAMFS to use <b>a</b> <b>linked</b> list for the free block management. We chose <b>a</b> <b>linked</b> list because of its stability and the least implementation cost. It {{is well known that}} <b>a</b> <b>linked</b> list can be used for the free block management of a file system (Bach 1986). Since our objective for this work is to investigate how the management data structures of file systems affect the memory allocation costs, the implementation cost should be saved. Once we find <b>a</b> <b>linked</b> list works effectively, we should consider other more functional data structures for the free block management, such as the buddy system. The Linux kernel provides the standard operations for basic data structures, and the operations for <b>a</b> <b>linked</b> list are included. We used these operations to add and delete a block to the linked list of the free blocks. The region used for the free block bitmap was removed, and is now used for data blocks.|$|R
