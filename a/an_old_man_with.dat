25|$|Some {{statues of}} Joseph depict his staff as topped with flowers, recalling the non-canonical Protoevangelion's {{account of how}} Mary's spouse was chosen by {{collecting}} the walking sticks of widowers in Palestine, and Joseph's alone bursting into flower, thus identifying him as divinely chosen. The Golden Legend, which derives its account from the much older Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, tells a similar story, although it notes that all marriageable men of the Davidic line and not only widowers were ordered by the High Priest to present their rods at the Temple. Several Eastern Orthodox Nativity icons show Joseph tempted by the Devil (depicted as <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> furled wings) to break off his betrothal, and how he resists that temptation. There are some paintings with him wearing a Jewish hat.|$|E

He then appears first as a handsome man {{and then as a}} beautiful boy.

He is described as tall, black and bristly, and as seeming cruel and fierce.

500|$|In addition, Bramshill House {{was cited}} by the {{historian}} William Page as a possible location for the Legend of the Mistletoe Bough, a ghost story associated with several English country mansions. This legend tells of a bride who supposedly hid in a wooden chest during a game of hide and seek on her wedding night. In the case of Bramshill House, the story has it that this happened at Christmas time, and that the bride was found fifty years later still wearing her wedding dress and with a sprig of mistletoe in her hand; the chest is {{on display in the}} entrance hall. The woman is sometimes identified as John Cope's daughter Anne, who married Hugh Bethell of Yorkshire. An alternative claim is that she was Genevre Orsini, who was married in 1727, and that her ghost came to Bramshill from Italy together with the chest. In his monograph on the house, the Victorian writer Sir William Cope preferred this theory and added that the chest on display was not the original, which had been proved large enough by [...] "a woman of comely proportions" [...] who had tested it by lying down in it, but which had been taken away by Sir Denzil Cope's widow in 1812. The ghost of the bride {{is referred to as the}} White Lady, and she is said by Legg to haunt the Fleur de Lys room. According to Legg, Michael I of Romania asked to be moved to another room during a stay there, in order to not be disturbed by the young woman in white who passed through his bedroom every night. <b>An</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> a grey beard, thought by Legg to be the father or husband of the White Lady, is reported to stare through windows and at the Mistletoe Chest.|$|E
