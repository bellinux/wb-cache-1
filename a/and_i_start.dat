500|$|Lopez later {{confirmed}} {{in an interview}} On Air with Ryan Seacrest, that the completed music video would premiere jointly on season ten of American Idol and on Vevo on March 3,2011. Fans could vote between three alternative endings through Idols official website. Lopez said the idea behind giving fans the choice was {{to give them a}} chance to see what she experienced. [...] "You get to do what I do,... Like, I go in there with my videos <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> editing and picking all the shots I like and the things that I like and what I feel the best kind of feeling for the record is. You guys get to do that. We picked two different ones and we weren't sure." [...] The alternative endings included three varying scenes: in the first, the video ends with a close-up of Lopez's face in the silver lace catsuit; the second ends with a shot of dancers defying gravity on the walls and ceiling, while the final ending ends with a shot of Lopez on the dance floor in her harem pants. The first ending was the one used in the final video.|$|E
2500|$|Wallace {{was known}} for {{stirring}} crowds with his oratory. The Huntsville Times interviewed Bill Jones, Wallace's first press secretary, who recounted [...] "a particularly fiery speech in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1964 that scared even Wallace, [...] angrily shouted to a crowd of 1,000 people that 'little pinkos' were 'running around outside' protesting his visit, and continued, after thunderous applause, saying, 'When you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> marching and demonstrating and carrying signs, we will close every highway in the country.' The audience leaped to its feet {{and headed for the}} exit," [...] Jones said, [...] "It shook Wallace. He quickly moved to calm them down." ...|$|E

50|$|About {{five years}} ago, I {{tried to make}} my life as {{complicated}} as possible. So <b>I</b> <b>started</b> this restaurant, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> this Little Idiot illustrators’ collective, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> a bottled beverage company, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> bought this piece of property upstate. <b>And</b> suddenly <b>I</b> had this very complicated life, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> realized that all the complications that filled my life weren’t making me happy. So I spent the last year basically {{trying to get rid}} of everything.|$|R

2500|$|... {{and more}} of our company were killed. The captain told us to dig in <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> to ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he continued, [...] "we'll go on {{a little}} further. It seems better that I should make what's in my mind quite clear to you. You see, Captain Dampier <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> in a week." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, good gracious!" [...] he {{retorted}} quite sharply, [...] "what rubbish next? As if {{the affairs}} of Europe {{were going to be}} arranged by Providence according to whether you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> for an excursion on a Thursday or a Friday!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "DEAR SIR--One line to {{say that}} your letter has just reached me at my lodging in London. I think I know who sent the strange man to inquire at Allonby. It matters little. Before he finds out his mistake, I shall be at Dumfries. My luggage is packed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> for the North by the next train.|$|E
60|$|I {{pulled open}} the drawer; as I did so, both Miss Trelawny <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> back in amazement.|$|R
25|$|I {{stopped being}} a hippie <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> {{to develop the}} idea of devolution. I got real, real pissed off.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> {{almost out}} of my skin at the {{unexpected}} London accent. It was as if one suddenly found oneself in the Tube.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have I ever broken my word? I {{promise you}} that the day the Scarlet Pimpernel <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> for France, I will send you that {{imprudent}} letter of his by special courier. More than that, I will pledge you the word of France, that the day I lay hands on that meddlesome Englishman, St. Just will be here in England, safe {{in the arms of}} his charming sister." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose they}} are getting on all right," [...] she said. [...] "I have done nothing {{for the last two}} days but try them on. You see, we put them out to three milliners, and they all three seem to reach the same point together, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> after breakfast, and it takes about two hours at each place. You don't know what trouble you have given me by hurrying things on so unreasonably." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{this minute}} a voice, clear and sweet, from a tall {{lady in a}} black veil, says, [...] "Mr. Titmarsh," [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> and murmur an {{ejaculation}} of respectful surprise, as I recognize no less a person than the Right Honorable the Countess of Knightsbridge, taking her tea, breaking up little bits of toast with her slim fingers, and sitting between a Belgian horse-dealer and a German violoncello-player who has a conge after the opera--like any other mortal.|$|E
5000|$|... "I was at {{home with}} my mother <b>and</b> {{suddenly}} <b>I</b> had a vision. I could see inside my mother's body <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> telling her about the organs I could see. Now, I have to switch from my regular vision to what I call medical vision. For {{a fraction of a}} second, I see a colorful picture inside the person <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>start</b> to analyze it." [...] says Demkina ...|$|R
60|$|A fair, slight {{woman in}} a long {{travelling}} cloak brushed past her. She raised her veil, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> at once to my feet. It was Lady Delahaye.|$|R

6000|$|... "Name your snake-juice, you-all--the winner pays!" [...] Daylight {{called out}} loudly to all about him, {{at the same}} time rising from his chair and {{catching}} the Virgin by the arm. [...] "Come on for a reel, you-all dancers. The night's young yet, and it's Helen Breakfast and the mail contract for me in the morning. Here, you-all Rawlins, you--I hereby do take over that same contract, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> for salt water at nine A.M.--savvee? Come on, you-all! Where's that fiddler?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Precisely," [...] cried Tudor, delighted. [...] "You've got the idea. And Berande is {{just the}} place, and this {{is just the}} right time. Miss Lackland will be taking her siesta, and she'll think we are. We've got two hours for it before she wakes. So hurry up and come on. You start out from the Balesuna <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> from the Berande. Those two rivers are the {{boundaries}} of the plantation, aren't they? Very well. The field of the duel will be the plantation. Neither principal must go outside its boundaries. Are you satisfied?" ...|$|E
60|$|To-morrow evening Mrs. Grant <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> for Washington, Pa., {{where we}} will spend a few days, then go to Harrisburgh, Washington, D.C., and toward {{the last of the}} month get around to Elizabeth to spend a few days with you before taking our {{departure}} for Europe. We have not entirely decided whether to take the American line from Philadelphia or the Inman line from New York City. Both have tendered pressing invitations, and both present good accommodations. If we take the former we will sail on the 9th or 16th of May, if the latter on the 19th.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{forced to}} work," [...] Austin replied. [...] "Since Jake <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> the African {{business}} I'm pretty closely occupied. For one thing, he won't write the English letters, and my Spanish clerks can't." ...|$|R
60|$|I hesitated, but {{a glance}} from Lady Angela settled the matter. For another such I would have walked into hell. Ray <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> off together, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{was not long}} before I spoke of the things which were in my mind.|$|R
60|$|He {{broke off}} {{suddenly}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>and</b> looked round, half amazed, half frightened. The continuous {{sound of an}} electric-bell, which {{seemed to come from}} within a few feet of me, was echoing through the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "Melancholy news! Madame Lagarde is dead. Nothing {{is known}} of her son but that he has left England. I have {{found out that he}} is a {{political}} exile. If he has ventured back to France, it is barely possible that I may hear something of him. I have friends at the English embassy in Paris who will help me to make inquiries; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> for the Continent in a day or two. Write to me while I am away, to the care of my father, at 'The Manor House, near Dartford.' He will always know my address abroad, and will forward your letters. For your own sake, remember the warning I gave you this afternoon! Your faithful friend, A. B." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At night, {{sitting here}} between {{the shadows and}} the dull glow of the [...] {{smouldering}} twigs, I sometimes think I hear the tapping I have learnt [...] to listen for, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> from my seat, and softly {{open the door and}} [...] look out. But only the Night stands there. Then I close-to the [...] latch, and she--the living woman--asks me in her purring voice what [...] sound I heard, hiding a smile as she stoops low over her work; and I [...] answer lightly, and, moving towards her, put my arm about her, feeling [...] her softness and her suppleness, and wondering, supposing I held her [...] close to me with one arm while pressing her from me with the other, [...] how long before I should hear the cracking of her bones.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, in this case, {{it seems}} as if you might be of great {{assistance}} to us, and yet not do very much violence to your own feelings. You know as well as I do that the chances are Newcombe or his men are or will be scouring the country to-day for those who shot Hoxie's well. Now, if Dick, Jim <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> out alone, and they see us driving about the country where we presumably have no business, they will follow us, and good-by to our chances of getting settled very soon. But if you and Gurney will take your fishing-tackle, Pete and I will go with you in our double wagon, and while he and I are attending to work, I will show you as good trout fishing as you ever saw." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I took {{a notion}} I wouldn't {{wait for the}} cattle-ship, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> back on a French boat. Thought I'd try it. They live well. But I hoped I should astonish you a little, too. I might as well waited." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 1836. September. Wednesday 21.--Wordsworth <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> in my {{carriage}} for Lowther, crossed Kirkstone to Paterdale, by Ulleswater, {{going through}} the Glenridding Walks,[236] and calling at Hallsteads. We reached the castle time enough before dinner for him {{to give me a}} walk.|$|R
60|$|At last all was ready, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> for town. Papa put me {{in charge}} of a lady of his acquaintance, who was also going to London, and then said good-bye, with many comic {{injunctions}} as to my behaviour in good society.|$|R
6000|$|Some quick {{music is}} inexpressibly mournful. It seems just like one's own feelings--exultation and action, with the remembrance of past sorrow wailing up, yet without bitterness, tender in its shrillness, through the mingled tide of present joy; and the notes seem thoughts--thoughts pure of words; and a spirit seems {{to call to}} me in them and cry, [...] "Hast thou not felt all this?" [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> when I find myself {{answering}} unconsciously, [...] "Yes, yes, I know it all! Surely we {{are a part of}} all we see and hear!" [...] And then, the harmony thickens, and all distinct sound is pressed together and absorbed in a confused paroxysm of delight, where still the female treble and the male bass are distinct for a moment, and then one again--absorbed into each other's being--sweetened and strengthened by each other's melody.

Three {{thousand}} dollars, all mine, from the Government, and Mister Kennan sees that it is paid {{to me by the}} Government and not robbed from me by the men with the guns. Just because I kicked the man in the head who was like a mountain lion! It is fortune. It is America. And I am glad that I have left Italy and come to chop wood on Mister Kennan's ranch. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> this hotel in Glen Ellen with the three thousand dollars. I know there is large money in the hotel business. When I was a little boy, did not my father have a hotel in Napoli? I have now two daughters in high school. Also I own an automobile." ...|$|E
60|$|My dearest Miss Mitford,--I {{this moment}} receive your little note. It makes me very sad and {{apprehensive}} about you, and I would give all this bright sunshine for weeks for one explanatory word which might make me more easy. Arabel speaks of receiving your books--I suppose 'Atherton'--and of having heard from yourself {{a very bad}} account of your state of health. Are you worse, my beloved friend? I have been waiting to hear the solution of our own plans (dependent upon letters from England) in order to write to you; and when I found our journey to London was definitively rendered impossible till next spring, I deferred writing yet again, it was so painful to me {{to say to you}} that our meeting could not take place this year. Now, I receive your little note and write at once to say how sad that makes me. It {{is the first time that}} the expression of your love, my beloved friend, has made me sad, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> as from an omen. On the other hand, the character you write in is so firm and like yourself, that I do hope and trust you are not sensibly worse. Let me hear by a word, if possible, that the change of weather has done you some little good. I understand there has scarcely been any summer in England, and this must necessarily have been adverse to you. A gleam of fine weather would revive you by God's help. Oh, that I could look in your face and say, 'God bless you!' as I feel it. May God bless you, my dear, dear friend.|$|E

"In 2005 I got {{a guitar}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> to just play, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>started</b> to write songs," [...] Afshari stated in an {{interview}} regarding {{the beginning of his}} career. Whilst still at school he fronted the band 'Just Me Again', and performed {{for the first time at}} The Garage in Islington in 2009. After completing his GCSEs, Afshari and his bandmates took a year off studies to focus on music. They supported You Me at Six on their British tour, including a performance at The O2 Arena.|$|R
6000|$|Then a few {{listless}} men gathered round a broker, {{and suddenly}} became intent, while a murmur of interest {{rose through the}} drowsy heat.

6000|$|<b>I</b> had <b>started,</b> on {{entering}} the room, at the skeleton, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> once {{more at the}} dog. The old servant noticed me each time with a sardonic grin.
