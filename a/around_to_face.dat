5|$|In agriculture, the {{increased}} usage of sheep with long-fibred wool allowed a stronger thread to be spun. In addition, the spinning wheel replaced the traditional distaff for spinning wool, tripling production. A less technological refinement that still greatly affected daily {{life was the}} use of buttons as closures for garments, which allowed for better fitting without having to lace clothing on the wearer. Windmills were refined with the creation of the tower mill, allowing {{the upper part of the}} windmill to be spun <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the direction from which the wind was blowing. The blast furnace appeared around 1350 in Sweden, increasing the quantity of iron produced and improving its quality. The first patent law in 1447 in Venice protected the rights of inventors to their inventions.|$|E
5|$|With {{the weather}} worsening, Lütjens {{attempted}} to detach Prinz Eugen at 16:40. The squall was not heavy {{enough to cover}} her withdrawal from Wake-Walker's cruisers, which continued to maintain radar contact. Prinz Eugen was therefore recalled temporarily. The cruiser was successfully detached at 18:14. Bismarck turned <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> Wake-Walker's formation, forcing Suffolk to turn away at high speed. Prince of Wales fired twelve salvos at Bismarck, which responded with nine salvos, none of which hit. The action diverted British attention and permitted Prinz Eugen to slip away.|$|E

5|$|The adult {{stage is}} usually short, its {{function}} only to mate and lay eggs. The genitalia of female flies are rotated to a varying {{degree from the}} position found in other insects. In some flies, this is a temporary rotation during mating, but in others, it is a permanent torsion of the organs that occurs during the pupal stage. This torsion {{may lead to the}} anus being below the genitals, or, in the case of 360° torsion, to the sperm duct being wrapped around the gut and the external organs being in their usual position. When flies mate, the male initially flies on top of the female, facing in the same direction, but then turns <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> in the opposite direction. This forces the male to lie on his back for his genitalia to remain engaged with those of the female, or the torsion of the male genitals allows the male to mate while remaining upright. This leads to flies having more reproduction abilities than most insects, and much quicker. Flies occur in large populations due to their ability to mate effectively and quickly during the mating season.|$|E
25|$|To Upton's right, {{the brigade}} of Col. William S. Truex found {{a gap in}} the Confederate line, between the brigades of Clingman and Brig. Gen. William T. Wofford, through a swampy, brush-filled ravine. As Truex's men charged through the gap, Clingman swung two regiments <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> them, and Anderson sent in Brig. Gen.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the stressed-skin construction, Reggiane introduced several advanced features on the Re.2000, such as a modern structure, which was considerably more advanced than the ones used in Macchi's and other Italian fighters of the time, along with an elliptical wing profile. Overall, the design possessed greater aerodynamic sophistication in comparison to other Italian rivals rivals such as the Fiat G.50 and Macchi C.200. The Re.2000 was furnished with retractable landing gear; the main gear retracted via the Curtiss method, the wheels rotating <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> flat within the wheel wells when retracted. The atypical fairing covered the landing gear's actuation mechanism, while the legs incorporated hydraulic shock absorbers and drag struts to effective absorb loads; pneumatic brakes were also fitted. The tail wheel was both retractable and steerable.|$|E

25|$|Anderson's {{attack was}} poorly coordinated and driven {{back by the}} heavy {{firepower}} of the Union cavalry's Spencer repeating carbines. By 9 a.m. Wright's lead elements arrived at the crossroads, but Wright decided to delay Grant's intended attack until after Smith arrived, which occurred in the afternoon, and the XVIII Corps men began to entrench {{on the right of}} the VI Corps. At 6:30p.m. the attack that Grant had ordered for the morning finally began. Both Wright's and Smith's corps moved forward. Wright's men made little progress south of the Mechanicsville Road, recoiling from heavy fire. North of the road, Brig. Gen. Emory Upton's brigade also met with heavy fire from Brig. Gen. Thomas L. Clingman's brigade and fell back to its starting point. To Upton's right, the brigade of Col. William S. Truex found a gap in the Confederate line through a swampy, brush-filled ravine. As Truex's men charged through the gap, Clingman swung two regiments <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> them, and Anderson sent in Brig. Gen. Eppa Hunton's brigade from his corps reserve. Truex became surrounded on three sides and was forced to withdraw.|$|E
25|$|When a {{young worker}} leaves the nest {{for the first}} time, it will {{generally}} make 2 to 3 'orientation flights' in order to familiarize itself with {{the entrance to the}} colony amidst the surrounding landscape. In the first flight, the worker flies approximately 25nbsp&cm out of the nest at once and then quickly turns <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the entrance. The wasp slowly flies {{back and forth to the}} nest several times, surveying an angle that is approximately 90 degrees, while facing the entrance. Then, the wasp promptly returns to the nest, the whole flight lasting only about one minute or less. Soon after returning from the first flight, the wasp will leave the nest in a similar fashion, but this time ventures out approximately 15 to 20 meters and covers an angle of approximately 280 degrees. Once 2 meters away, V. rufa will fly back and forth repeatedly in a figure-eight pattern, while facing the entrance to the nest. In some cases, after this second flight the wasp will have gathered all of the knowledge necessary to fly off. Other wasps must make a third orientation flight that is like the second one. At first, the worker may miss the entrance to the nest many times; however, after six to twelve trips, the wasp gains its bearings; flights become longer, and reentry into the colony becomes more precise.|$|E

500|$|The {{first stage}} is the Blind Auditions, where artists sing {{in front of}} the judges/coaches. In this round, each coach selects 14 singers for their team. Four coaches, all {{noteworthy}} recording artists, choose teams of contestants through a blind audition process. Each coach has the length of the auditioner's performance (about 90 seconds) to decide if they want the singer on their team. If one of the coaches is satisfied with the voice of an artist, and wants to mentor them for the next stage, they press the [...] "I WANT YOU" [...] button by their chair. This turns the chair <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the stage, and allows the coach to see the artist for the first time after they have sung. This avoids any bias {{on the part of the}} judge/coach because of an artist's characteristics or personality. If two or more coaches want the same singer, the singer chooses their coach. The artist's journey on the show comes to an end if no coach selects them.|$|E
500|$|After a {{military}} bomb-disposal officer reported that Savage's car {{should be treated}} as a suspected bomb, the police handed over control of the operation to the SAS. As soldiers were moving into position to intercept the trio, Savage split from McCann and Farrell and began running south. Two soldiers pursued Savage while two approached McCann and Farrell; as they did so, the pair were said to make threatening movements, as a result of which the soldiers opened fire, shooting them multiple times. As soldiers caught up with Savage, he was alleged to have turned <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> them while reaching into his jacket; he was also shot multiple times. All three were subsequently found to be unarmed, and Savage's car was found to contain no explosives; enquiries resulting from keys found on Farrell led authorities to a second car, containing a large quantity of explosives, in a car park in Spain. Almost two months after the shootings, the documentary [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] was broadcast on British television. Using reconstructions and eyewitness accounts, it presented the possibility that the three IRA members had been unlawfully killed. The documentary proved extremely controversial; several British newspapers described it as [...] "trial by television".|$|E

25|$|From {{the middle}} of the 17th century, almost all new Latin-rite altars were built against a wall or backed by a reredos, with a {{tabernacle}} placed on the altar or inserted into the reredos.

2500|$|According to the {{traditional}} Muslim view, the Qiblah originally faced the Noble Sanctuary in Jerusalem. [...] This Qiblah was used for over 13 years, from 610 CE until 623 CE. Seventeen months after the Islamic prophet Muhammad's 622 CE arrival in Medina – the date is given as 11 February 624 – the Qiblah became oriented towards the Kaaba in Mecca. According to traditional accounts from Muhammad's companions, the change happened very suddenly during the noon prayer in Medina, in a mosque now known as Masjid al-Qiblatayn (Mosque of the Two Qiblahs). Muhammad was leading the prayer when he received revelations from God instructing {{him to take the}} Kaaba as the Qiblah (literally, [...] "Turn then Thy face {{in the direction of the}} sacred Mosque:"). According to {{the traditional}} accounts contained in the hadith and sira, Muhammad, who had been facing Jerusalem, upon receiving this revelation, immediately turned <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> Mecca, and those praying behind him also did so.|$|E
2500|$|On {{systems with}} {{double-ended}} tram cars capable of running in both directions, the trolley pole {{must always be}} pulled behind the car and not pushed, or [...] "dewiring" [...] is very likely, which can cause damage to the overhead wires. At terminus points, the conductor must turn the trolley pole <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the correct direction, pulling it off the wire either with a rope or a pole and walking it {{around to the other}} end. In some cases, two trolley poles are provided, one for each direction: in this case {{it is a matter of}} raising one and lowering the other. Since the operator could raise the pole at one end whilst the conductor lowered the other, this saved time and was much easier for the conductor. Care had to be taken to raise the downed pole first, to eliminate the damage caused by arcing between the pole and wire. In the US, the dual-pole system was the most common arrangement on double-ended vehicles. However, pushing of the pole (called [...] "back-poling" [...] in the US or [...] "spear-poling" [...] in Australia), was quite common where the trams were moving at slow speeds, such as at wye terminals (also known as reversers) and whilst backing into the sheds.|$|E

40|$|On the one hand, India is {{a growing}} economy that needs skilled labour, {{self-employed}} entrepreneurs and employees to tackle its economic and social challenges. On the other hand, India faces high unemployment rates, especially among young people. Graduates from industrial training institutes (ITIs) in particular are often facing difficulties in pursuing self-employment. Entrepreneurship education is an essential element in preparing young people for self-employment. This paper analyses how {{and to what extent}} entrepreneurship education has been conceived and implemented in vocational schools in and <b>around</b> Bangalore <b>to</b> <b>face</b> these challenges. Methodologically the authors use a three-step approach following the theories of a `prescribed', `adopted' or `enacted' curriculum. Qualitative interviews are used for the analysis of the adopted and enacted curriculum. The authors conclude that whereas the prescribed curriculum includes several elements of entrepreneurship education and teacher's understanding is in line with the prescription, the understanding is seldom translated into input in the day-to-day teaching. The plausible reasons for this gap are discussed in this paper...|$|R
