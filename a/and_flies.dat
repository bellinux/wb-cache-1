5|$|Betty instantaneously {{realizes that}} Simon needs magic {{in order to}} survive, so she places him on the magic carpet <b>and</b> <b>flies</b> it to Wizard City. On the way, Death (voiced by Miguel Ferrer) appears to Simon in a vision, {{offering}} his one and only chance of escaping {{the curse of the}} crown. Simon refuses, and Betty attacks and eventually destroys Bella Noche. Simon reverts to Ice King, unaware of what happened. Later, he recounts the events to a captured Muscle Princess, while Betty—who survived the struggle with Bella Noche—watches sadly from a window <b>and</b> <b>flies</b> off on the magic carpet.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a series of}} laboratory experiments in order to investigate {{on the effect of}} lime <b>and</b> <b>fly</b> ash on hydraulic conductivity of sand. The study were conducted on Baldivis Yellow Concrete Sand (The Western Australian sand) with different percentage of lime (% 1, 2 %, 3 %), fly ash (% 5, % 10, % 15) and composition of lime <b>and</b> <b>fly</b> ash. A few researches carried out in this field however, the result of current study revealed an effective role of lime <b>and</b> <b>fly</b> ash in the reduction of hydraulic conductivity of sand. The obtained results illustrated that, in compared with the other results of lime <b>and</b> <b>fly</b> ash specimens the combination of lime <b>and</b> <b>fly</b> ash had a significant reduction in hydraulic conductivity of sand. Hence, it seems that utilization of the combination of lime <b>and</b> <b>fly</b> ash was more effective than use additives alone (i. e., lime <b>and</b> <b>fly</b> ash) ...|$|R

5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} {{is a much}} more approachable bird than the water pipit. If startled, it flies a fairly short distance, close to the ground, before it alights, whereas its {{relative}} is warier <b>and</b> <b>flies</b> some distance before landing again. Eurasian rock pipits are usually solitary, only occasionally forming small flocks.|$|E

As a reward for saving Peach, she kisses Mario on the nose and bakes the cake she had promised. The game ends when Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi and Wario wave goodbye to the player as Lakitu films <b>and</b> <b>flies</b> away. A photo with Peach's cake appears.|$|E
5|$|Emus {{can suffer}} from both {{external}} and internal parasites, but under farmed conditions are more parasite-free than ostriches or rheas. External parasites include the louse Dahlemhornia asymmetrica and various other lice, ticks, mites <b>and</b> <b>flies.</b> Chicks sometimes suffer from intestinal tract infections caused by coccidian protozoa, and the nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis infects the emu {{as well as a}} wide range of other birds, causing haemorrhagic diarrhoea. Other nematodes are found in the trachea and bronchi; Syngamus trachea causing haemorrhagic tracheitis and Cyathostoma variegatum causing serious respiratory problems in juveniles.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} in 1927 by the West Australian botanist Charles Gardner, the species {{was at one}} stage considered a variety of B.sphaerocarpa. Although there are no recognised subspecies or varieties, both lignotuberous and nonlignotuberous forms exist for Banksia violacea. Wasps, ants <b>and</b> <b>flies</b> have been recorded visiting flower spikes. Banksia violacea is classified as Not Threatened under the Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia. Regarded as of little value to floriculture, it is rarely cultivated.|$|E

5|$|Fruit bodies can be parasitized by the molds Sepedonium ampullosporum, S.laevigatum, and S.chalcipori. In Sepedonium infections, a {{white to}} powdery yellow mold covers {{the surface of}} the fruit body. The {{mushrooms}} are a food source and rearing habitat for several insect species, including the fungus gnats Mycetophila fisherae and M.signatoides, <b>and</b> <b>flies</b> such as Pegomya winthemi and species of the genera Sciophila and Mydaea. The cottontail rabbit species Sylvilagus brasiliensis has been recorded feeding on the mushrooms in Costa Rica.|$|E
5|$|In Hans Christian Andersen's {{version of}} the story, a bluebird had been viewing Thumbelina's story since the {{beginning}} and had {{been in love with}} her since. In the end, the bird is heartbroken once Thumbelina marries the flower-fairy prince, <b>and</b> <b>flies</b> off eventually arriving at a small house. There, he tells Thumbelina's story to a man who is implied to be Andersen himself and chronicles the story in a book.|$|E
5|$|Insects, {{including}} beetles, moths, wasps <b>and</b> <b>flies,</b> use the bark, {{leaves and}} flowers {{of the tree}} in various ways. Some feed or hide camouflaged in the skirt of dead leaves, a favourite dry place for weta to hide in winter. Many of the insect companions of C.australis have followed it into the domesticated surroundings of parks and home gardens. If the leaves are left to decay, the soil underneath cabbage trees becomes a black humus that supports a rich array of amphipods, earthworms and millipedes.|$|E

Kate struggles to put on her oxygen mask due to the handcuffs, so she uncuffs herself using the marshal's keys and puts the marshal's oxygen mask on him before attaching her own, {{at which point the}} tail end of the plane suddenly breaks off <b>and</b> <b>flies</b> away.|$|E
5|$|Lepidopterans {{are soft}} bodied, fragile and almost defenseless while the {{immature}} stages move slowly or are immobile, hence all stages {{are exposed to}} predation by birds, small mammals, lizards, amphibians, invertebrate predators (notably parasitoid and parasitic wasps <b>and</b> <b>flies)</b> as well as fungi and bacteria. To combat this, Lepidoptera have developed a number of strategies for defense and protection which include camouflage, aposematism, mimicry, {{and the development of}} threat patterns and displays.|$|E
5|$|Liliaceae {{are subject}} {{to a wide variety}} of {{diseases}} and pests, including insects, such as thrips, aphids, beetles <b>and</b> <b>flies.</b> Also fungi, viruses and vertebrate animals such as mice and deer. An important horticultural and garden pest is the scarlet lily beetle (Japanese red lily beetle, Lilioceris lilii) and other Lilioceris species which attack Fritillaria and Lilium. Lilium species may be food plants for the Cosmia trapezina moth. A major pest of Tulips is the fungus, Botrytis tulipae.|$|E
