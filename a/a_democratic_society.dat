5|$|Ochs's {{managers}} {{during this}} part of his career were Albert Grossman (who also managed Dylan and Peter, Paul, and Mary) followed by Arthur Gorson.

5|$|A key {{distinction}} between the bills of rights of the Commonwealth jurisdictions referred to above and the Singapore Constitution {{is that in the}} latter document, the grounds set out in Article 15(4) for restricting freedom of religion are not expressly subject to any requirement of reasonableness or necessity in <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>society.</b> One may query whether this is sufficient justification for a Singapore court to decline to apply a proportionality analysis to Article 15(4).|$|E

5|$|Helen Shiller {{earned her}} high school diploma in 1965 from Woodstock County School in Vermont, the same {{progressive}} boarding school that Pete Seeger's children attended. Shiller graduated {{with a degree in}} history from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where she was active in the anti-Vietnam war movement and in the Students for <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Society</b> (SDS). In 2005, Shiller graduated from DePaul University's School for New Learning Master's Program, where her focus was public policy.|$|E
5|$|Hand's civil {{instincts}} were at {{odds with}} the duty of a judge to stay aloof from politics. As a judge he respected even bad laws; as a member of society he felt free to question the decisions behind legislation. In his opinion, members of <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>society</b> should be involved in legislative decision-making. He therefore regarded toleration as a prerequisite of civil liberty. In practice, this even meant that those who wish to promote ideas repugnant to the majority should be free to do so, within broad limits.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Power {{enrolled}} at Brandeis as a sociology major and honor student {{at a time}} of anti-Vietnam War protests at the school. She became known for wandering the campus braless and barefoot in an orange-colored smock, for her attendance at Students for <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Society</b> protest rallies and for her involvement in the Brandeis Strike Information Center. She and her room-mate Susan Saxe worked to organize student protests for a committee known as the National Student Strike Force. The two also became acquainted with fellow organizer Stanley Ray Bond, an ex-convict and soldier attending classes at the university on a special program.|$|E

50|$|The {{court also}} argued that in certain {{protected}} areas, such as public education funding, government grants “may {{not be used to}} suppress unpopular expression”. Since both academic expression and artistic expression reached the core of <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>society’s</b> cultural and political vitality, the court found that, similar to education funding, art funding enhanced education neutrality.|$|R
5|$|Democracy {{essentially}} means {{rule of the}} people. To build <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>society</b> and rule, {{there must}} be citizen participation by an informed electorate. The freedom to speak and express is thus crucial {{for the formation of}} public opinion on political questions, and is indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth. In Singapore, the right to freedom of speech and expression is guaranteed to citizens by Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution, though it is subject to many qualifications. Parliament may by law impose restrictions on the right as it considers necessary or expedient {{in the interest of the}} security of Singapore, friendly relations with other countries, public order or morality, and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court, defamation or incitement to any offence.|$|E
5|$|On March 4, 1969 the FSU {{chapter of}} Students for <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Society,</b> an {{unregistered}} university student organization, sought to use university facilities for meetings. The FSU administration, under President Stanley Marshall, subsequently {{decided not to}} allow the SDS the use of university property and obtained a court injunction to bar the group. The result was a protest and mass arrest at bayonet point of some 58 students in an incident later called the Night of the Bayonets. The university Faculty Senate later criticized the administration's response as provoking as an artificial crisis. Another notable event occurred when FSU students massed in protest of student deaths at Kent State University causing classes to be canceled. Approximately 1000 students marched to the ROTC building where they were confronted by police armed with shotguns and carbines. Joining the all-night vigil, Governor Claude Kirk appeared unexpectedly with a wicker chair and spent hours, with little escort or fanfare, on Landis Green discussing politics with protesting students.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, {{the city}} gained a {{reputation}} as an important center for liberal politics. Ann Arbor also became a locus for left-wing activism and anti-Vietnam War movement, {{as well as the}} student movement. The first major meetings of the national left-wing campus group Students for <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Society</b> took place in Ann Arbor in 1960; in 1965, the city was home to the first U.S. teach-in against the Vietnam War. During the ensuing 15 years, many countercultural and New Left enterprises sprang up and developed large constituencies within the city. These influences washed into municipal politics during the early and mid-1970s when three members of the Human Rights Party (HRP) won city council seats on the strength of the student vote. During their time on the council, HRP representatives fought for measures including pioneering antidiscrimination ordinances, measures decriminalizing marijuana possession, and a rent-control ordinance; many of these remain in effect in modified form. Alongside these liberal and left-wing efforts, a small group of conservative institutions were born in Ann Arbor. These include Word of God (established in 1967), a charismatic inter-denominational movement; and the Thomas More Law Center (established in 1999), a religious-conservative advocacy group.|$|E
