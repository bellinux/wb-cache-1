5|$|In 2011, Kalam was criticised {{by civil}} groups over his {{stand on the}} Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant; he {{supported}} {{the establishment of the}} nuclear power plant and was accused of not speaking with the local people. The protesters were hostile to his visit <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> him as a pro-nuclear scientist and were unimpressed by the assurances he provided regarding the safety features of the plant.|$|E
5|$|In their 2004 {{study of}} lynching, Peter Ehrenhaus and A. Susan Owen compare the lynching to a blood sacrifice, arguing Waco {{residents}} {{felt a sense}} of collective righteousness after Washington's death, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> him as the presence of evil in the community. Bernstein compares the public brutality of the lynch mob to the medieval English practice of hanging, drawing, and quartering people convicted of high treason.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{unofficial}} {{responses from}} members of the Bush administration's were very favorable <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> the book as reflecting the success of the 'surge' strategy. However, National Security Adviser Stephen J. Hadley released an official statement on September 5 disputing some of Woodward's interpretations and opinions expressed in the book, though not with his record of the facts.|$|E

5|$|The Manhattan District {{accepted}} that {{wages and salaries}} had to be high enough to allow contractors to hire and retain good workers. It generally allowed wages and salaries to be paid by contractors <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> fit, subject to limits imposed by wartime national wage and price controls intended to limit inflation. Salaries above $9,000 had {{to be approved by}} Patterson and Groves.|$|E
5|$|U.S. diplomats were {{concerned}} that the move {{would be seen as}} a power grab, as Diệm was organising and driving an electoral process in which he was a candidate. The Americans felt that a legislature should be formed first and that the body should oversee the referendum, but Diệm ignored their advice. Ambassador G. Frederick Reinhardt informed Washington that Diệm had no intention of allowing a level playing field for the opposition, and that the foreign press had already made much of Diệm's democratic pronouncements being a facade. The Department of State agreed and opted to avoid trumpeting the referendum as an exercise in democracy for fear of attracting negative reactions to their foreign policy. Nevertheless, U.S. officials in Vietnam were pleased with the referendum, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> it as an opportunity to strengthen South Vietnam and avoid defeat to the communists, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> a republican model as being more robust.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, in {{accordance}} with the political strategy, Minh's junta was reluctant to carry out large-scale offensives, which concerned the Americans, particularly Harkins, Taylor and CIA chief John McCone. While Harkins and Taylor had opposed Diệm's ouster, the junta's policies also disappointed many supporters of the anti-Diệm coup <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> regime change as necessary to their hopes of a more aggressive anti-communist war. For their part, Minh's leadership group believed that a more low-key military approach was needed for their political campaign against the insurgency.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, some of {{the stones}} were used to {{construct}} an outdoor reading terrace adjoining the Helen Crocker Russell Library of Horticulture, part of the Strybing Arboretum and Botanical Gardens in Golden Gate Park. Other stones were used for various purposes around Golden Gate Park and the Japanese Tea Garden, taken unofficially by park workers <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> fit. Some of these {{ended up in the}} park's AIDS Memorial Grove, others on a scent-based flower walkway named Garden of Fragrance.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after taking}} office, McElroy formed a panel to {{investigate}} ABM issues. The panel examined the Army and Air Force projects, {{and found the}} Zeus program considerably more advanced than Wizard. McElroy told the Air Force to stop work on ABM missiles and use Wizard funding {{for the development of}} long-range radars for early warning and raid identification. These were already under development as the BMEWS network. The Army was handed the job of actually shooting down the warheads, and McElroy gave them free hand to develop an ABM system <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> fit, free of any range limitations.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} Nixon's {{election}} as President in November 1968, he asked Chotiner what job he would like, and Chotiner {{indicated that he}} wanted to be chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), but was told that was impossible. However, Mitchell and soon-to-be White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman wished to see Chotiner given a position outside the White House, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> him as a rival. Accordingly, they proposed that Chotiner be made RNC executive director, to wield the real power with the chairman as figurehead. A reluctant Nixon, who was worried about Chotiner's hatchet-man reputation, finally agreed, and Chotiner wrapped up his affairs in California.|$|E

5|$|By late December 1991, {{just over}} a month after victory had been proclaimed in Vukovar, opinion polls found that 64 percent wanted {{to end the war}} {{immediately}} and only 27 percent were willing for it to continue. Milošević and other senior Serbian leaders decided against continuing the fighting, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> it as politically impossible to mobilise more conscripts to fight in Croatia. Desertions from the JNA continued as the well-motivated and increasingly well-equipped Croatian Army became more difficult to counter. By the end of 1991, Serbia's political and military leadership concluded that it would be counter-productive to continue the war. The looming conflict in Bosnia also required that the military resources tied up in Croatia be freed for future use.|$|E
5|$|In 1542, the New Laws {{were issued}} {{with the aim}} of {{protecting}} the indigenous peoples of the Spanish colonies from their overexploitation by the encomenderos. In an effort to enforce the New Laws, a fleet of 27 ships set out from Spain on 19 July 1544, carrying friar Bartolomé de las Casas and his religious followers. Las Casas arrived in Ciudad Real with 16 fellow Dominicans on 12 March 1545. The Dominicans were the first religious order to attempt the evangelisation of the native population. Their arrival meant that the colonists were no longer free to treat the natives <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> fit without the risk of intervention by the religious authorities.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the clergy}} who served under him in Armagh {{recommended}} that the Pope appoint Conwell to head the diocese permanently. Some opposed him, accusing him of being frequently absent from his parish to visit France and Scotland. The British government also objected, favoring Patrick Curtis instead, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> him as more friendly to their interests. The Vatican agreed, and Pope Pius VII appointed Curtis to Armagh, offering Conwell instead a choice of the sees of Philadelphia or Madras; Conwell chose Philadelphia. Now more than 70 years old, he was ordained bishop in London on September 24, 1819, by Bishop William Poynter, the Vicar Apostolic of the London District, assisted by Fathers James Bramston and Joseph Francis Carpue.|$|E

5|$|Mary Dudley {{was one of}} Queen Elizabeth's most {{intimate}} confidantes {{during the early years}} of her reign. Her duties included nursing the Queen through smallpox in 1563 and acting as her mouthpiece towards diplomats. A sister of Elizabeth's favourite, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, she remained always loyal to her family. She was the mother of seven children and accompanied her husband, Sir Henry Sidney, to Ireland and the Welsh Marches. From the 1570s the couple complained repeatedly about their, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> it, niggardly treatment at the Queen's hands. Still one of Elizabeth's favourite ladies, Mary Dudley retired from court life in 1579, suffering from ill health during her last years.|$|E
5|$|Once a {{proclamation}} {{had been}} issued ordering the Army Reserve {{to be called}} out for permanent service, the Crown was legally permitted to order the Army Council to issue directions to embody {{all or part of}} the Territorial Force. If no such order was forthcoming, however, then unless Parliament directed otherwise the Army Council was to issue a direction for the embodiment of the entire Force. If Parliament was not sitting at the time of the proclamation, it was to resume its session within ten days. The Crown was able to issue a proclamation disembodying the whole Force, and until such proclamation was issued the Army Council was permitted to embody or disembody such elements of the Force <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> fit.|$|E
5|$|The Supremes' {{name change}} fueled already present {{rumors of a}} solo career for Ross {{and contributed to the}} {{professional}} and personal dismantling of the group. In fact, Gordy intended to replace Ross with Barbara Randolph as early as the fall of 1966, but changed his mind and instead kept Ross in the group for several more years. Gordy's caution may have been sparked by an incident in early 1966 as the group prepared to make their second appearance at the Copacabana. Angered by erratic behavior from Florence Ballard, Gordy intended to replace her with Marlene Barrow, a member of the Motown in-house singing group the Andantes. However, when club management heard of this change, they threatened to cancel the group's appearance if Ballard was replaced, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> Ballard's banter with her group mates as a major part of their act's success.|$|E

60|$|As {{she said}} those melancholy words, all the lost {{tenderness}} {{returned to her}} voice, and all the lost beauty trembled back into her face. Her eyes rested as lovingly on the blighted, solitary, ill-omened view before us, <b>as</b> if <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> the friendly hills of Cumberland in the dim and threatening sky.|$|R
60|$|As {{she spoke}} {{she seemed to}} be inspired; and her eyes had a far-away look <b>as</b> though <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> {{something}} beyond mortal sight. And then the deep eyes filled up with unshed tears of great emotion. The very soul of the woman seemed to speak in her voice; whilst we who listened sat entranced.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the find}} was {{reported}} under the Portable Antiquities Scheme, {{it was not}} declared treasure under the 1996 Treasure Act because single items of non-precious metal {{are not covered by}} the act. The finder and landowner were thus free to dispose of the helmet <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> fit. The discovery was publicly announced by Christie's in mid-September 2010; the helmet was the centrepiece of its 7 October auction catalogue, featuring on the cover and six more pages. Its value was put at £200,000 – £300,000 ($309,200 – $463,800). The Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery launched an appeal with the aim of purchasing the helmet and making it the focus of a new Roman frontier gallery due to open in 2011. The campaign immediately attracted numerous donations, including £50,000 from an anonymous overseas benefactor who offered the sum if a matching sum could be raised by the public (it was); a £1 million offer from the National Heritage Memorial Fund; a £300,000 pledge from the Headley Trust and the Monument Trust; £200,000 from the Art Fund; and £75,000 from the J Paul Getty Jr Charitable Trust. By the time of the auction three and a half weeks after the campaign had been launched, the museum had raised enough money to support a bid of up to £1.7 million. Behind the scenes, efforts were made to persuade the finder and landowner to agree a private sale with the museum, but these approaches failed.|$|E
5|$|In 1542, the New Laws {{were issued}} {{with the aim}} of {{protecting}} the indigenous peoples of the Spanish colonies from their overexploitation by the encomenderos.

The Dominicans were the first religious order to attempt the evangelisation of the native population. Their arrival meant that the colonists were no longer free to treat the natives <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> fit without the risk of intervention by the religious authorities. The Dominicans soon came into conflict with the established colonists. Colonial opposition to the Dominicans was such that the Dominicans were forced to flee Ciudad Real in fear of their lives. They established themselves nearby in two indigenous villages, the old site of Villa Real de Chiapa and Cinacantlán. From Villa Real, Bartolomé de las Casas and his companions prepared for the evangelisation of all the territory that fell within the Bishopric of Chiapa. The Dominicans promoted the veneration of Santiago Matamoros (St. James the Moor-slayer) as a readily identifiable image of Spanish military superiority. The Dominicans soon saw the need to reestablish themselves in Ciudad Real, and the hostilities with the colonists were calmed. In 1547, the first stone for the new Dominican convent in Ciudad Real was placed.|$|E
5|$|The {{organisational}} {{ability of}} the government agencies charged with overseeing {{the integration of the}} refugees into society was frequently criticised by American officials. In many cases, the individual officials simply made their own decisions and the goal of resettling the northerners without disruption to the existing local economy or social structure was not achieved. In other cases, the northern Catholics formed their own committees and settled and built on areas <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> fit. By the end of September, the shortage of funds and equipment had eased, but their distribution was not organised or coordinated effectively. At the same time, some Viet Minh cadres who stayed in the south after the partition pretended to be refugees and stirred up trouble inside the camps. Aside from disruption by communists, other non-communist movements such as the Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng were strong in areas of central Vietnam, were opponents of Diem and some of them were military personnel. This sometimes caused hindrance in civilian-military cooperation in the resettlement program, as some of Diem's public servants were suspicious of the military's reliability as a working partner.|$|E
