40|$|Astract. The {{purpose of}} this work was to perform a {{chemical}} and mechanical characterization of a preoxidized CoCrMo alumina blasted surface. This is a commonly performed surface treatment used in metal-porcelain systems for dental restorations to remove oxides formed during preoxidation heat treatment from the metal’s surface. CoCrMo dental alloy’s specimens produced by lost wax process were examined in terms of chemical composition using X-Ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS); in terms of mechanical characteristics through the means of a microhardness test {{and in terms of}} surface roughness using a profilometer. It was investigated the chemical composition of various surface conditions: non-preoxidized, preoxidized, ground oxidized surface and sandblasted oxidized surface. After <b>alumina</b> <b>blasting,</b> the oxides level on metal’s surface remained high. <b>Alumina</b> <b>blasting</b> treatment (Ø 110 µm) produced an 84 % increase of CoCrMo surface hardening and an increase in surface roughness (Ra= 0. 58 µm). It was found alumina contaminants on the metal’s surface. Therefore, it was concluded that <b>alumina</b> <b>blasting</b> do not entirely removes the oxide layer formed during preoxidation heat treatment. It produced a chemical and mechanical surface modification that can influence the metal-ceramic bond strength...|$|E
40|$|Context: Bracket {{debonding}} is {{a common}} problem during orthodontic treatment. This type of failure is associated to masticatory forces, poor adhesion, {{and the need for}} repositioning the piece. Aims: The objective of this work was to compare the shear bond strength of debonded brackets that were reconditioned using different protocols (<b>alumina</b> <b>blasting</b> versus hydrofluoric etching). Settings and Design: This was an in vitro experimental study with 45 stainless steel orthodontic brackets. Subjects and Methods: They were randomly divided into three groups: (1) New brackets (n = 15), (2) brackets reconditioned using 10 % hydrofluoric acid for 60 s (n = 15), and (3) brackets reconditioned by aluminum oxide blasting until complete removal of the remaining resin (n = 15). In Groups 2 and 3, the insertion of composite resin proceeded in two stages to simulate a type of bracket failure in which the bonding resin was left at the bracket base. For the shear test, the assembly composed by the metallic support, and specimen was taken to the Instron universal testing machine in which the specimens were loaded using a semicircle-shaped active tip in the region of the bonding interface parallel {{to the surface of the}} bracket at a speed of 0. 5 mm/min. Statistical Analysis Used: The data were subjected to D′Agostino′s normality test to have their distribution checked. Analysis of variance and Tukey′s test (P < 0. 01) were used to compare the findings between groups. Results: The results indicated that Group 1 (new brackets) showed higher bond strength than that obtained for the group treated with hydrofluoric acid (Group 2, P < 0. 01). The bond strength value obtained for the group treated with <b>alumina</b> <b>blasting</b> (Group 3) was statistically similar to those obtained for Groups 1 and 2. Conclusions: The aluminum oxide blasting technique was effective for the reconditioning of orthodontic brackets. Nevertheless, the reconditioning technique using 10 % fluoridric acid for 60 s was not efficient for clinical use...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: It is {{desirable}} that {{the surfaces of}} surgical implants be uncontaminated by foreign materials to avoid untoward tissue reactions, and grit blasting is widely assumed to leave clean metal surfaces. SEM examination and X-ray microanalysis of a recovered 'pure' titanium implant casting that was associated with tissue breakdown revealed embedded particles of alumina. The casting had been cleaned of investment by blasting with alumina grit. Methods: A variety of treatments of cast titanium plates was used: (a) to establish that the observed aluminium {{was due to the}} blasting grit, and (b) to determine whether removal of investment could be achieved effectively by other means. SEM examination and X-ray microanalysis were used. Results: The detected aluminium was associated with embedded fragments identified as coming from the blasting grit. Acid-pickling and mechanical (rotary instrument) trimming produced minimally contaminated surfaces. Conclusions: Whilst unproven, the presence of the alumina is viewed with great concern as a possible causative agent in the observed tissue breakdown and procedures avoiding <b>alumina</b> <b>blasting</b> are recommended as a precautionary measure. © 1995. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

In this work, <b>alumina</b> <b>blasted</b> Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy has been thermally treated and its in vitro biocompatibility has been assessed. Roughness of the blasted alloy was not found significantly altered after heat treatment while chemical surface analysis indicated an increase in stable TiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 oxides. Cell attachment, spreading, cytoskeleton organization as well as cell proliferation, viability, and procollagen I peptide secretion of human primary osteoblasts, impaired on <b>alumina</b> <b>blasted</b> Ti 6 Al 4 V, were found to be greatly enhanced on the thermally oxidized blasted alloy. Other informative markers of the osteoblastic phenotype such as alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, osteoprotegerin, and mineralized nodule formation were evaluated and indicated that osteoblasts responded at the same extent on untreated and thermally treated blasted alloys.

The present investigation {{was carried out}} to evaluate the effects of an experimental surface treatment using etchant and primer on bond strength between a resin composite and Ti– 6 Al– 4 V alloy. MethodsDisk-shaped Ti– 6 Al– 4 V alloy was machine milled, the surface was air abraded with alumina, and the alloy was chemically etched with 5 wt% ammonium hydrogen fluoride (F-etch) for 30 s. A phosphate primer (MDP-primer) {{was applied to the}} bonding area, and then a resin composite, with or without milled-fiber resin composite (FRC), was veneered on the specimen. Shear bond strengths were determined after thermocycling for 20, 000 cycles. Bond strength data were analyzed by means of ANOVA and a multiple comparison test (α= 0. 05). The surface of Ti– 6 Al– 4 V alloy was observed using a scanning electron microscope before and after the etching procedure. ResultsNo-FRC/F-etch/MDP-primer exhibited the highest bond strength (28. 2 MPa), followed by No-FRC/No-etching/MDP-primer (24. 2 MPa), FRC/F-etch/MDP-primer (19. 9 MPa), FRC/No-etching/MDP-primer (17. 8 MPa), No-FRC/No-etching/No-primer (13. 6 MPa), while FRC/No-etching/No-primer (2. 5 MPa) resulted in the lowest value. Microphotographs showed that numerous micro and nano pits were created on the Ti– 6 Al– 4 V alloy surface modified with F-etch. ConclusionsThe bond strength between Ti– 6 Al– 4 V alloy and the veneering resin composite was the highest when the alloy surface was modified with <b>alumina</b> <b>blasting,</b> fluoride etchant, and phosphate primer successively...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Ti-based bulk {{metallic}} glass (BMG) {{is a new}} class of titanium alloys that exhibits excellent properties for biomedical applications. They have high strength, good corrosion resistance, low elastic modulus and satisfactory biocompatibility. Therefore, Ti-based BMG is an excellent alternative material to be used in biomedical application. Titanium alloy with a nominal composition of the Ti 40 Zr 10 Co 36 Pd 14 was synthesized by replacing Cu with Co in a better-known bulk glass forming composition. Coin-shape samples with a diameter of 15 mm and thickness of 1 mm were prepared by arc-melting and casting into copper mold. The coin-shape samples were polished, then followed by blasting with 50 µm and 250 µm average particle sizes of alumina. <b>Alumina</b> <b>blasting</b> caused plastic deformation at the surface and induced change in surface roughness. The larger size of alumina particle, the higher the Ra, Rq and Rt with significant difference. Some abrasive alumina particles were found to be embedded onto the blasted surface. The blasted Ti 40 Zr 10 Co 36 Pd 14 sample showed lower roughness values than those blasted Ti- 6 Al- 4 V samples. This may be because of the higher hardness values of Ti 40 Zr 10 Co 36 Pd 14 sample, when compared to the softer Ti- 6 Al- 4 V samples. The contact angle measurement which demonstrated wettability of all samples did not show significant difference in a tested range of Ra (from 40 to 428 nm) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, viscosities and {{sulphide}} capacities of high <b>alumina</b> <b>blast</b> furnace slags were investigated. The systems investigated were four component CaO-SiO 2 -MgO-Al 2 O 3 quaternary system, CaO-SiO 2 -MgO-Al 2 O 3 -TiO 2 and CaO-SiO 2 -MgO-Al 2 O 3 -CaF 2 quinary systems. Viscosities of high <b>alumina</b> <b>blast</b> furnace slags were experimentally {{determined by the}} rotating cylinder method using Brookfield digital viscometer model LVDV-II+ pro. Experiments were conducted in the temperature range of 1573 - 1873 K. The effects of temperature, basicity, TiO 2, CaF 2 and silica activity of slags on viscosity were studied. Viscosity decreases with basicity for high <b>alumina</b> <b>blast</b> furnace slags with increase in basicity and CaF 2. At higher basicity (~ 0. 8), slag viscosity decreases even with small amount of TiO 2 (~ 2 %) addition in the slag. With increase in silica activity {{in the range of}} 0. 1 to 0. 4,viscosity of slag increases and the increase is steeper below liquidus temperature. Sulphide capacity of the slag was measured using gas-slag equlibria. The liquid slag was equilibrated with Ar-CO-CO 2 -SO 2 gas mixture. The slag systems studied were the same {{as in the case of}} viscosity measurements. Experiments were conducted in the temperature range of 1773 to 1873 K. Effect of temperature, basicity, MgO,TiO 2 and CaF 2 contents of slags on sulphide capacity were studied. As expected, sulphide capacity was found to increase with increase in temperature and basicity. At higher experimental temperature (~ 1873 K) TiO 2 was found to decrease the sulphide capacity of slags. But, at lower temperature, there was no significant effect of TiO 2 on the sulphide capacity. Sulphide capacity increases with increase in MgO content of slag if MgO content is more than 5 %. Based on above experimental data, models were developed for estimation of viscosity and sulphide capacity of blast furnace slags. These models were later on applied for designing the slags for achieving the optimum slag characteristics so that slag volume can be reduced. With the help of these models slag volume was reduced to the extent of 5 - 10 kg per ton hot metal and also silicon content of the hot metal was reduced by around 10 % with some improvement in slag viscosity and sulphide capacity of the slag.

40|$|The {{composition}} and properties of blast furnace slags greatly affect the furnace productivity {{and the quality}} of hot metal produced. Viscosity is an important physical property of slags, strongly influenced by the chemical composition, structure and the temperature. Experimental measurement of slag viscosity requires high temperature equipment and is time consuming. Therefore, chemical parameters are used to identify trends in viscosity as function of chemical composition. Limited information is available for High <b>Alumina</b> <b>Blast</b> Furnace Slags, since much of the open literature deals with Low Alumina Slags, with alumina content less than 15 weight percentage. High Alumina slags (alumina content in the range of 15 % to 30 %) are predominantly encountered in Indian Blast Furnaces. It appears that these slags have higher viscosity and lower sulphide capacity than the low alumina slags. The effect of chemical composition / ionic structure on viscosity has been interpreted in this work, using the chemical parameter of optical basicity. Data reported in the literature have been used, along with the values of liquidus temperature, for high alumina slags. Three slag systems, i. e., CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2, CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 -MgO and CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 -MgO-TiO 2 have been considered in this work. The trends observed are discussed in the paper...|$|R

Impact phenomena between an alumina particle with the mean particle size of 2 µm and a glass substrate has been successfully simulated by smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. From the simulation result, we have deduced that a cubic particle is fractured by an impact, and it is adhered on to the substrate.

The production of glass ceramics from industrial waste such as fly ash, red mud, blast furnace slag gaining more importance now a days because of their availability and low cost. In the present work an attempt has been made to produce glass ceramic with high <b>alumina</b> content using <b>blast</b> furnace slag. Generally alumina is very difficult to melt. To produce base glass for glass ceramic from blast furnace slag, an additional low melting phase which aid in dissolving the alumina can be provided by blast furnace slag. Blast furnace slag is generally produced at the temperature range 1300 oC to 1400 oC. High alumina content glass with alumina percentage as high as 30 % (more alumina content in E-glass) requires melting temperature as high as 1600 oC. Therefore using blast furnace slag as one of the main constituents can help in reducing the melting temperature of the precursor glass prior to glass ceramic production.
