Thus atomistic simulation of membrane {{and in particular}} <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> calculations of its properties is difficult and computationally expensive. Quantum chemical calculations has recently been successfully performed to estimate dipole and quadrupole moments of lipid membranes.|$|E

If {{the resolution of the}} data is better than 1.4 Å (140 pm), direct methods can be used to obtain phase information, by exploiting known phase relationships between certain groups of reflections.|$|E

The album charted in Australia at number 85. Following the addition of new drummer Alex Bent, the band released The Sin and the Sentence in October 2017.|$|E
5|$|In April 1966, Feynman {{delivered}} {{an address}} to the National Science Teachers Association, in which he suggested how students could be made to think like scientists, be open-minded, curious, and especially, to doubt. In the course of the lecture, he gave a definition of science, which he said came about by several stages. The evolution of intelligent life on planet Earth—creatures such as cats that play and learn from experience. The evolution of humans, who came to use language to pass knowledge from one individual to the next, so that the knowledge was not lost when an individual died. Unfortunately, incorrect knowledge could be passed down as well as correct knowledge, so another step was needed. Galileo and others started doubting the truth of what was passed down and to investigate <b>ab</b> <b>initio,</b> from experience, what the true situation was—this was science.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ab</b> <b>initio</b> quantum {{mechanical}} and chemical methods {{may be used}} to calculate the potential energy of a system on the fly, as needed for conformations in a trajectory. This calculation is usually made in the close neighborhood of the reaction coordinate. Although various approximations may be used, these are based on theoretical considerations, not on empirical fitting. <b>Ab</b> <b>initio</b> calculations produce a vast amount of information that is not available from empirical methods, such as density of electronic states or other electronic properties. A significant advantage of using <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> methods is the ability to study reactions that involve breaking or formation of covalent bonds, which correspond to multiple electronic states.|$|E
25|$|Such varying {{molecular}} geometries {{can also}} be computed, at least in principle, by employing <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> quantum chemistry methods that can attain high accuracy for small molecules, although claims that acceptable accuracy can be also achieved for polynuclelotides, and DNA conformations, were recently {{made on the basis}} of vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectral data. Such quantum geometries define an important class of <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> molecular models of DNA which exploration has barely started, especially related to results obtained by VCD in solutions. More detailed comparisons with such <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> quantum computations are in principle obtainable through 2D-FT NMR spectroscopy and relaxation studies of polynucleotide solutions or specifically labeled DNA, as for example with deuterium labels.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{efficient}} <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> computer {{programs such as}} ATMOL, Gaussian, IBMOL, and POLYAYTOM, began {{to be used to}} speed <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> calculations of molecular orbitals. Of these four programs, only Gaussian, now vastly expanded, is still in use, but many other programs are now in use. At the same time, the methods of molecular mechanics, such as MM2 force field, were developed, primarily by Norman Allinger.|$|E

25|$|In some courts, {{violations}} of the stay are treated as void <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> {{as a matter of}} law, although the court may annul the stay to give effect to otherwise void acts. Other courts treat violations as voidable (not necessarily void <b>ab</b> <b>initio).</b> Any violation of the stay may give rise to damages being assessed against the violating party. Non-willful {{violations of}} the stay are often excused without penalty, but willful violators are liable for punitive damages and may also be found to be in contempt of court.|$|E
25|$|A {{structure}} database, , {{was recently}} constructed which contains 3D structural models {{of all human}} G-protein coupled receptors, built by the GPCR-I-TASSER pipeline through homology modeling and <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> structure prediction.|$|E
25|$|In {{a similar}} manner, laws made after {{adoption}} of the Constitution by the Constituent Assembly must be compatible with the constitution, otherwise the laws and amendments will be deemed to be void <b>ab</b> <b>initio.</b>|$|E
25|$|Poing synthesises {{the user}} protein {{in the context}} of these {{distance}} constraints, modelled by springs. Regions {{for which there is no}} template information are modelled by the <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> simplified physics model of Poing.|$|E
25|$|From this theory, {{an attempt}} {{can be made}} to predict the band {{structure}} of a particular material, however most <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> methods for electronic structure calculations fail to predict the observed band gap.|$|E
25|$|If {{a lender}} charges above the lawful {{interest}} rate, a court {{will not allow}} the lender to sue to recover the debt because the interest rate was illegal anyway. In some states (such as New York) such loans are voided <b>ab</b> <b>initio.</b>|$|E
25|$|In many cases, large {{molecular}} {{systems can}} be modeled successfully while avoiding quantum mechanical calculations entirely. Molecular mechanics simulations, for example, use one classical expression for the energy of a compound, for instance the harmonic oscillator. All constants appearing in the equations must be obtained beforehand from experimental data or <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> calculations.|$|E
25|$|The Commission will devise its own {{procedures}} (including for {{consultations with}} the State Government {{as may be}} considered appropriate by the Commission), and may appoint committees, consultants/advisers to assist it. The Commission may {{take into account the}} existing material and reports available on the subject and consider building upon the same rather than attempting to address all the issues <b>ab</b> <b>initio.</b>|$|E
25|$|Even if {{the nuclear}} force is well constrained, a {{significant}} amount of computational power is required to accurately compute the properties of nuclei <b>ab</b> <b>initio.</b> Developments in many-body theory have made this possible for many low mass and relatively stable nuclei, but further improvements in both computational power and mathematical approaches are required before heavy nuclei or highly unstable nuclei can be tackled.|$|E
25|$|While {{carrying}} out a complete <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> (that is, first-principles) modelling is now computationally possible, {{it has not been}} widely applied yet. Thus, a phenomenological model is accepted as being an adequate method of capturing experimental behaviors. The Debye model and the Lorentz model use a first-order and second-order (respectively) lumped system parameter linear representation (such as an RC and an LRC resonant circuit).|$|E
25|$|The waging of {{aggressive}} war by Japan against China in 1937 and beyond violates the peace that was brokered in the Treaty of Shimonoseki. In 1941, with {{the declaration of}} war against Japan, the Chinese government declared this treaty void <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> (never happened in the first place). Therefore, some argue that, with no valid transfer of sovereignty taking place, the sovereignty of Taiwan naturally belongs to China.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} type of <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> {{electronic structure}} calculation is the Hartree–Fock method (HF), {{an extension of}} molecular orbital theory, in which the correlated electron-electron repulsion is not specifically taken into account; only its average effect {{is included in the}} calculation. As the basis set size is increased, the energy and wave function tend towards a limit called the Hartree–Fock limit. Many types of calculations (termed post-Hartree–Fock methods) begin with a Hartree–Fock calculation and subsequently correct for electron-electron repulsion, referred to also as electronic correlation. As these methods are pushed to the limit, they approach the exact solution of the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation. To obtain exact agreement with experiment, it is necessary to include relativistic and spin orbit terms, both of which are far more important for heavy atoms. In all of these approaches, along with choice of method, it is necessary to choose a basis set. This is a set of functions, usually centered on the different atoms in the molecule, which are used to expand the molecular orbitals with the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) molecular orbital method ansatz. <b>Ab</b> <b>initio</b> methods need to define a level of theory (the method) and a basis set.|$|E
25|$|Statutes {{and common}} law rules that are {{declared}} unconstitutional are void <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> (from the beginning) – {{it is as}} if they never existed. This may create a problem as past cases decided {{on the basis of the}} unconstitutional legislation or precedent may be open to re-litigation. To overcome this problem, the Court of Appeal may apply the doctrine of prospective overruling to preserve the state of law prior to the date when the unconstitutional law is overruled.|$|E
25|$|Another {{group led}} by Houk {{suggested}} the methods employed by Rogers and Kistiakowsky was inappropriate, because that comparisons of heats of hydrogenation evaluate not only conjugation effects but also other structural and electronic differences. They obtained -70.6 kcal/mol and -70.4 kcal/mol {{for the first and}} second hydrogenation respectively by <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> calculation, which confirmed Rogers’ data. However, they interpreted the data differently by taking into account the hyperconjugation stabilization. To quantify hyperconjugation effect, they designed the following isodesmic reactions in 1-butyne and 1-butene.|$|E
25|$|Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes {{transcripts}} {{have been}} observed with x-ray crystallography to have a NCIN-capped RNA product {{in addition to being}} observed under in vivo condition. The efficiency of NCIN capping is largely influenced by promoter sequence especially the -35 box and -10 box upstream of the transcription start site. Studies so far have defined the mechanism and structural basis of NCIN mediated capping but the function of these caps are still to be discovered. Recent consensus is that NCIN-mediated <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> capping occurs in all organisms.|$|E
25|$|Computational {{chemical}} {{methods can}} be applied to solid state physics problems. The electronic structure of a crystal is in general described by a band structure, which defines the energies of electron orbitals for each point in the Brillouin zone. <b>Ab</b> <b>initio</b> and semi-empirical calculations yield orbital energies; therefore, they {{can be applied}} to band structure calculations. Since it is time-consuming to calculate the energy for a molecule, it is even more time-consuming to calculate them for the entire list of points in the Brillouin zone.|$|E
25|$|Today, Norway has {{approximately}} 10-15 {{families who}} were formerly recognised as noble by Norwegian kings. These include Anker, Aubert, Falsen, Galtung, Huitfeldt, Knagenhjelm, Løvenskiold, Munthe af Morgenstierne, Treschow, Werenskiold, and the Counts of Wedel-Jarlsberg. In addition, there exist non-noble families who descend patrilineally from {{individuals who had}} personal (non-hereditary) noble status, for example the Paus family and several families of the void <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> office nobility. There is even foreign nobility in Norway, mainly Norwegian families who originate in other countries and who have or had noble status there.|$|E
25|$|The aim {{of another}} ELEMENT-study was {{to monitor the}} {{development}} of general mathematical ability. One finding is that those admitted to a Gymnasium after the fourth grade had showed better mathematical ability than those who stayed in primary school, <b>ab</b> <b>initio.</b> That was true for all social classes. Another finding was that children of all social classes did better {{in the sixth grade}} when they were at a Gymnasium. By the end of the sixth grade, those attending a Gymnasium were two years ahead of those attending a primary school.|$|E
25|$|The {{generation}} of a protein sequence {{is much easier}} than the determination of a protein structure. However, {{the structure of a}} protein gives much more insight in the function of the protein than its sequence. Therefore, a number of methods for the computational prediction of protein structure from its sequence have been developed. <b>Ab</b> <b>initio</b> prediction methods use just the sequence of the protein. Threading and homology modeling methods can build a 3-D model for a protein of unknown structure from experimental structures of evolutionarily-related proteins, called a protein family.|$|E
25|$|It {{will not}} always be {{possible}} to sue under s 2(1), however. If there is no contract, for instance if an agreement was void <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> on the ground of non est factum, {{then it will be}} necessary to sue under Hedley Byrne. Also, the misrepresentation must precede the contract, and is not actionable under s 2(1) even if it is found in the contract subsequently. Lastly, it has been suggested by McKendrick that if s 2(1)'s application leads to draconian consequences, a court may not be willing to enforce it.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} molecular dynamics, {{one potential}} energy surface (usually the ground state) {{is represented in}} the force field. This {{is a consequence of}} the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. In excited states, chemical reactions or when a more accurate representation is needed, electronic behavior can be obtained from first principles by using a quantum mechanical method, such as density functional theory. This is named <b>Ab</b> <b>Initio</b> Molecular Dynamics (AIMD). Due to the cost of treating the electronic degrees of freedom, the computational cost of these simulations is far higher than classical molecular dynamics. This implies that AIMD is limited to smaller systems and shorter times.|$|E
25|$|Density {{functional}} theory (DFT) {{methods are}} often {{considered to be}} <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> methods for determining the molecular electronic structure, {{even though many of}} the most common functionals use parameters derived from empirical data, or from more complex calculations. In DFT, the total energy is expressed in terms of the total one-electron density rather than the wave function. In this type of calculation, there is an approximate Hamiltonian and an approximate expression for the total electron density. DFT methods can be very accurate for little computational cost. Some methods combine the density functional exchange functional with the Hartree–Fock exchange term and are termed hybrid functional methods.|$|E
25|$|The Rochester and Pittsburgh Railroad Company {{was born}} on 29 January 1881 from {{the remains of the}} R The latter had been sold on 20 January for $600,000 to a New York {{syndicate}} of investors led by Walston H Brown. Brown, of Brown, Howard, and Company, had experience in railroad building; his company typified the many financial speculators and investment organizations which dealt in railroad companies and their securities. Another investment company to figure prominently in the BR history was that of Adrian Iselin. <b>Ab</b> <b>initio,</b> these investors planned expansion into the lucrative coal-haulage market. The source of the coal had by this time expanded south through western Pennsylvania into the Beech Tree area between Brockwayville and DuBois.|$|E
25|$|This motivates why wavelet {{transforms}} are {{now being}} adopted for {{a vast number of}} applications, often replacing the conventional Fourier transform. Many areas of physics have seen this paradigm shift, including molecular dynamics, chaos theory, <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> calculations, astrophysics, gravitational wave transient data analysis, density-matrix localisation, seismology, optics, turbulence and quantum mechanics. This change has also occurred in image processing, EEG, EMG, ECG analyses, brain rhythms, DNA analysis, protein analysis, climatology, human sexual response analysis, general signal processing, speech recognition, acoustics, vibration signals, computer graphics, multifractal analysis, and sparse coding. In computer vision and image processing, the notion of scale space representation and Gaussian derivative operators is regarded as a canonical multi-scale representation.|$|E
25|$|Accuracy {{can always}} be {{improved}} with greater computational cost. Significant errors can present themselves in <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> models comprising many electrons, due to the computational cost of full relativistic-inclusive methods. This complicates the study of molecules interacting with high atomic mass unit atoms, such as transitional metals and their catalytic properties. Present algorithms in computational chemistry can routinely calculate the properties of molecules that contain up to about 40 electrons with sufficient accuracy. Errors for energies can be less than a few kJ/mol. For geometries, bond lengths can be predicted within a few picometres and bond angles within 0.5 degrees. The treatment of larger molecules that contain a few dozen electrons is computationally tractable by approximate methods such as density functional theory (DFT).|$|E
25|$|One {{can also}} study {{sufficiently}} simplified models for which computers {{can be used}} to carry out calculations and see if a procedure suggested by perturbation theory may work beyond it. The second concept allows one {{to address the issue of}} defining a relativistic theory <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> without limiting the definition to perturbative expansions. This option is particularly relevant to the issue of describing bound states in QCD. However, to address this issue one needs to overcome certain difficulties that the renormalization group procedures based on the idea of reduction of cutoffs are not capable of easily resolving. To avoid the difficulties, one can employ the similarity renormalization group procedure. Both the difficulties and similarity are explained in the next section.|$|E
25|$|The school began {{replacing}} its Macchis with Pilatus PC-9 turboprop trainers in July 1989, {{the process}} being completed in September 1991. The jets {{continued to be}} operated by Pearce’s No.25 Squadron; some of No.2 FTS’s PC-9s also served temporarily with the squadron as fatigue issues took their toll on the Macchis. As the CT-4A Airtrainers of Point Cook were phased out and No.1 FTS disbanded in 1992–93, all-through flight training on the PC-9 began. Since 2006, No.2 FTS has been {{under the command of}} Air Training Wing, a component of Air Force Training Group, headquartered at RAAF Williams Laverton Base.

25|$|The company {{moved to}} have the case {{dismissed}} and compel arbitration. When that was denied, it petitioned the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal which ruled that arbitration was required because the entire contract had been challenged, not the severable arbitration clause. But then that decision was appealed to the Florida Supreme Court, which reversed {{on the grounds that}} the contract was illegal <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> and thus the arbitration clause was unenforceable. It read Prima Paint to distinguish between void contracts that could never have legal standing, such as the one at issue, and voidable contracts where that result could come to pass later as a result of dispute resolution but where the contract was legal on its face. One justice of that court, Raoul Cantero, dissented, saying that the majority was ignoring the actual language of the FAA.|$|E
