5|$|Another {{model for}} the {{formation}} of Type Ia supernovae involves the merger of two white dwarf stars, with the combined mass momentarily exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit. There is much variation in this type of event, and in many cases there may be no supernova <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>but</b> it is expected that they will have a broader and less luminous light curve than the more normal SN Type Ia.|$|E

5|$|Brian Horrocks was {{the only}} son of Colonel Sir William Horrocks, a doctor in the Royal Army Medical Corps. Born in India, Brian {{returned}} to Britain, where he was educated at Bow School, Durham, later Uppingham School, Rutland, an English public school, and entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in 1913. His score was sixth-lowest of the 167 successful applicants for cadetships—even after the addition of 200 bonus points for an Officer Training Corps (OTC) certificate, which not all the other candidates had. An unpromising student, {{he might not have}} received a commission <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> for the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914.|$|E

5|$|During the 2007 season, the Zero-G Rolls {{were removed}} from the ride and {{replaced}} with banked hills. Robin's hill was installed in March and Batman's in April. Batman's train was painted red so that Robin could use it, because Robin's train was damaged during a previous incident. The Robin side re-opened on April 7 and ran until June 28 when it was closed {{for the rest of the}} year. The Batman side did not operate <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>but</b> three of the five cars from the original Robin train were placed on Batman's maintenance track. Because of all of the problems the coaster had and the numerous failed attempts to fix the coaster, Six Flags decided to cut their financial and technical losses and dismantle the ride.|$|E
5|$|For many years, the {{classification}} of Herrerasaurus was unclear because it was known from very fragmentary remains. It was hypothesized to be a basal theropod, a basal sauropodomorph, a basal saurischian, or not a dinosaur <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> another type of archosaur. However, {{with the discovery of}} an almost complete skeleton and skull in 1988, Herrerasaurus has been classified as either an early theropod or an early saurischian in at least five recent reviews of theropod evolution, with many researchers treating it at least tentatively as the most primitive member of Theropoda.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{of science}} have noted that, while Darwin {{considered}} the ideas in Wallace's paper to be {{essentially the same}} as his own, there were differences. Darwin emphasised competition between individuals of the same species to survive and reproduce, whereas Wallace emphasised environmental pressures on varieties and species forcing them to become adapted to their local conditions, leading populations in different locations to diverge. Some historians, notably Peter J. Bowler, have suggested the possibility that in the paper he mailed to Darwin, Wallace was not discussing selection of individual variations <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> rather group selection. However, Malcolm Kottler has shown that this notion is incorrect and Wallace was indeed discussing individual variations.|$|E

Fermi had {{dismissed}} {{the possibility of}} fission {{on the basis of}} his calculations, but he had not taken into account the binding energy that would appear when a nuclide with an odd number of neutrons absorbed an extra neutron. For Fermi, the news came as a profound embarrassment, as the transuranic elements that he had partly been awarded the Nobel Prize for discovering had not been transuranic elements <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>but</b> fission products. He added a footnote to this effect to his Nobel Prize acceptance speech.|$|E
5|$|Presently Alcibiades {{sailed to}} Tissaphernes with a {{detachment}} of ships. According to Plutarch, the supposed {{purpose of this}} mission was to stop the Persian fleet from coming {{to the aid of}} the Peloponnesians. Thucydides is in agreement with Plutarch that the Persian fleet was at Aspendus and that Alcibiades told the troops he would bring the fleet to their side or prevent it from coming <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>but</b> Thucydides further speculates that the real reason was to flaunt his new position to Tissaphernes and try to gain some real influence over him. According to the historian, Alcibiades had long known that Tissaphernes never meant to bring the fleet at all.|$|E

5|$|The {{immediate}} {{result of}} the battle was inconclusive, both squadrons retiring with one ship damaged apiece. French losses had been heavy, with 15 killed and 20 wounded on Prudente, the latter including Renaud and 22 killed and 62 wounded on Cybèle. One sailor was killed and five wounded on Jean-Bart and no casualties were reported on Courier. By contrast, Centurion had only three men killed and 23 wounded and Diomede none <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>but</b> the damage to Osborne's ship was more problematic; while Renaud could repair and resupply his ships in nearby Port Louis, Centurion {{had to return to}} India, several thousand miles away, to affect repairs. Osborne was thus forced to abandon the blockade, with Centurion sailing to Bombay and Diomede to Madras.|$|E
5|$|The most {{decorated}} Australian Naval unit of World War One, however {{was not a}} ship <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>but</b> the Royal Australian Navy Bridging Train, a land-based unit composed {{mostly of}} reservists which landed at Suvla Bay with the British IX Corps and was responsible for receiving, storing and distributing the supplies, including potable water, of the British troops at Suvla. Due to their position working the piers and landings at Suvla, the Train was the last Australian unit to depart the Gallipoli Peninsula. After Gallipoli, the Train {{was sent to the}} Middle East, where they made a second amphibious landing at the Battle of Magdhaba, before returning to Australia and being disbanded after a series of miscommunications during May 1917.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 the {{evolutionary}} biologist Stephen Jay Gould compared Paley to Voltaire's Doctor Pangloss, {{the man who}} could argue any case (however hopeless). Gould is struck that Paley can claim that even the agonising pain of gallstones or gout could indicate the goodness of a loving God, with the justification that it felt so good when the pain stopped. Gould makes it clear he finds Paley's argument incorrect scientifically, but states that he respects it as a coherent and well-defended philosophy. Gould particularly respects Paley's method of identifying alternative possibilities and then systematically refuting them. Gould notes that Paley envisages a Lamarckist kind of evolution and rebuts it with the observation that men have not lost their nipples through disuse. However, Gould writes, Paley did not manage to think of one more alternative, natural selection, which has no purpose <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> just kills off whatever works less well in every generation.|$|E

5|$|In December 1695 the Spanish colonial {{authorities}} in Mérida received a diplomatic visit {{sent by the}} Aj Kan Ek'. The diplomatic contact had been negotiated by Spanish captain Francisco Hariza y Arruyo, alcalde of Bacalar-at-Chunjujub'. Hariza had sent a Christian Maya ambassador to Nojpetén from Tipuj in April 1695, who arrived {{around the same time}} that the Itza were preparing to defend themselves against a Spanish party entering from Guatemala; nonetheless the emissary was received in peace and despatched back to Hariza with promises of submission to Spain. In August Hariza travelled to Mérida in the company of a group of seven Tipuj natives offering submission to Spain. Four members of this party were not from Tipuj <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>but</b> were Itza diplomats sent incognito from Yalain to discuss possible peaceful contacts with the colonial authorities. The leader of the Itza delegation was AjChan, a nephew of the Itza king. When friar Avendaño was in Mérida in September 1695 between attempts to reach Nojpetén, he met with the Itza–Yalain delegation and was able to give an account of them when he travelled through Yalain after visiting Nojpetén in January 1696. AjChan and his companions returned to Nojpetén in November but did not stay long before leaving for Mérida again.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, Butinov and Knorozov had {{performed}} a {{statistical analysis of}} several rongorongo texts and had concluded that either {{the language of the}} texts was not Polynesian, or that it was written in a condensed telegraphic style, because it contained no glyphs comparable in frequency to Polynesian grammatical particles such as the Rapanui articles te and he or the preposition ki. These findings have since been used to argue that rongorongo is not a writing system <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>but</b> mnemonic proto-writing. However, Butinov and Knorozov had used Barthel's preliminary encoding, which Konstantin Pozdniakov, senior researcher at the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg (until 1996), noted was inappropriate for statistical analysis. The problem, as Butinov and Knorozov, and Barthel himself, had admitted, was that in many cases distinct numerical codes had been assigned to ligatures and allographs, as if these were independent glyphs. The result was that while Barthel's numerical transcription of a text enabled a basic discussion of its contents for the first time, it failed to capture its linguistic structure and actually interfered with inter-text comparison.|$|E
5|$|In the Hanzhong community, {{everyone}} {{was regarded as}} ill in some way. This was because sin caused qi to leave the body, and qi was necessary for life. In order to cure any illness, repentance was a crucial factor in ensuring {{that the loss of}} qi could be staunched. Repentance could be accomplished by spending time in a 'Chamber of Silence,' and reflecting on one's sins, or by beating one's breasts and kowtowing to heaven. Illness could be cured in other ways as well, such as using medicinal herbs and by listening to ritual music. Eating very little was also of extreme importance, and an ideal diet would consist of no food <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>but</b> only of noncorporeal things such as air, which the person could absorb through meditation.|$|E
