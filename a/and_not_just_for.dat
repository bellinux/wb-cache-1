5|$|As {{a tribute}} to his then-pregnant wife, Ilary Blasi, Totti imitated a {{childbirth}} scene by stuffing the ball under his shirt and {{lying on his back}} while his teammates extracted the ball. His current ritual of sucking his thumb after a goal began after his son was born and continued after the birth of his daughter. Blasi has revealed that Totti also sucks his thumb in dedication to her <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> their children. On 11 January 2015, Totti scored twice against Lazio in the Derby della Capitale as Roma came back from 2–0 down; he then took a selfie with Roma fans.|$|E

25|$|For example, in act 1, scene 2, the {{scenario}} is that Jenny and other girls are walking to Mahagonny. The music is surprisingly simple; {{just a simple}} solo with a short chorus and sparse orchestration. The music is not some baroque contrapuntal scheme, {{nor is it a}} Romantic forest of sound; rather, the music is very easy to listen to. This music setting matches with the idea of making music accessible to the public, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> educated artists. The music style also displays influences from popular music. During this time, American jazz was a sensation in Europe; since opera is set in America, {{it is not surprising that}} the tune and the beat have a jazz influence. The orchestration, also includes such non-classical instruments as a saxophone, a decidedly jazz instrument. By using a jazz style in the music, Weill immediately associates the action as happening in America. In addition to making a relatively exotic sound, Weill manages to incorporate the jazz style in the song without making it seem incongruous; the American and European music are seamlessly joined under Weill's hands.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} well {{received}} and was praised by reviewers for its clarity.

500|$|Retrospectively, Kristan Reed of Eurogamer called Another World [...] "one of {{the most}} visionary and memorable games of its time." [...] Reviewing the 15th Anniversary Edition in 2010, Eurogamer's John Walker called it [...] "still utterly beautiful", adding that the game's art style is [...] "just fantastic. Chahi's design is exquisitely simple and {{enormously}} evocative. Built from spare polygons, its paper-craft-like animation conjures the world, the creatures and the threat wonderfully." [...] In a 2014 review of the 3DS version, Bob Mackey of USGamer opined [...] "Another World is definitely an experience every gamer should have— <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> the sake of checking out a historical curiosity. Another World still feels incredibly forward-thinking, almost as if Chahi had developed a game for this decade's indie scene without even realizing it." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{production}} value has been met with positive critical response. Silverman praised the film's animation, stating that [...] "the movie is gorgeous, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> theatrical animation." [...] Silverman also praised the cast, most notably Yuri's voice actors. EGMnow also gave high praise to the animation calling it [...] "beautiful and rich" [...] and said [...] "It is top-of-the-line in artwork, artistic style and coloring. The action sequences, though {{reminiscent of the}} game, are not repetitive nor silly. This {{is a very serious}} movie and it was treated as such." [...] The Fandom Post agreed saying [...] "the feature has some absolutely stunning visuals which create lush and vibrant environments for the characters to live in which adds a wonderful polish to the work." [...] Similar praise was given by Jeffrey Kauffman from Blu-ray.com. Andy Hanley praised the distinctive character designs despite criticizing some aspects from the fight scenes.|$|E
500|$|Although {{all of the}} orphanage's {{residents}} were given a dose of Epsom salts once {{a week in the}} morning, some former residents have given accounts of brutal punishments and mistreatment. One states that because there were 200 boys and only 12 toilets, some would defecate in the urinals, drains, on the grass, or in their pants. As a result, the boys would receive beltings for doing this. Another account by a boy who stayed at the orphanage states that when he arrived there, he was separated from his brother and was given a set of clothes to wear despite having his own. Anyone who did not comply would receive a belting. The boys were issued no underwear and clothes were [...] washed only once a week. Beatings were common, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> punishment; sometimes it may have been more for mental scarring. Other accounts claim there were beatings, and repetitive rape, not only by the staff but also by older boys and the orphanage caretaker. Despite this, some former residents say the nuns were [...] "tough but fair" [...] and they [...] were fed three meals a day. Some even stayed in contact with their caregivers once they left.|$|E
500|$|The album's lead single, [...] "Tango del Pecado", is {{addressed}} {{to the parents of}} Residente's then-girlfriend, former Miss Universe Denise Quiñones, who did not approve of the couple's relationship. [...] He explains that the song expresses how he will still date her regardless of their opinions, and author Ed Morales observes that [...] "It's a calling out of the morality of Latin America. [...] It's just an invitation to turn everything upside-down by embracing the ugly and profane in life and, you know, asking people to go on that journey." [...] "Tango del Pecado" [...] also created controversy due to the repeated chanting of [...] "Súbele el volumen a la música satánica" [...] (turn up the satanic music). [...] Residente asserts that he did not add the line to create a reaction, saying, [...] "I never do something expecting something. I do things because I like them." [...] "El Avión Se Cae" [...] depicts the thoughts of a drunken airplane passenger. In [...] "Pal Norte", Residente discusses the plight of immigrants in the United States. [...] Commenting on the track's lyrical themes, he explained [...] "I had wanted to do that theme because I think it is an important topic. <b>And</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> the immigrants in the United States but all over. It is a song that immigrants can identify with, Dominicans as well as Puerto Ricans. All the people leave one country for another for the same reasons." [...] Although much of the album addresses immigration and moving to different countries, [...] "La Crema" [...] is a celebration of living in Puerto Rico.|$|E

[...] Towards the last few years of the brush war, one-piece suits became more prominent, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> aircrew and vehicle users. [...] Rhodesian camouflage suits commonly took the form of coveralls, but these were probably too hot for the climate and uniform regulations in the field were quite lax. Servicemen often modified their uniforms to shorten the sleeves while others wore privately acquired T-shirts in a bewildering variety of unofficial spinoffs on the army brushstroke. Long camouflage trousers were ignored in favour of drab running shorts. Despite acknowledging that the pattern itself was exceptional, security forces also criticised the fabric's mediocre quality and cited the NATO clothing worn by foreign volunteers as being [...] "far superior".|$|E
