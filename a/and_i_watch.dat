500|$|In January 2006, Cates {{announced}} that actor, comedian, and {{talk show host}} Jon Stewart, who had previously hosted two consecutive Grammy Awards ceremonies in 2001 and 2002, was chosen as host of the 2006 telecast. Cates explained the decision to hire him saying, [...] "My wife <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> him every night. Jon {{is the epitome of}} a perfect host â€” smart, engaging, irreverent and funny." [...] In a statement, Stewart expressed that he was honored to be selected to emcee the program, jokingly adding, [...] "Although, as an avid watcher of the Oscars, I can't help but be a little disappointed with the choice. It appears to be another sad attempt to smoke out Billy Crystal." ...|$|E
6000|$|Oh my boys, {{bending over}} your books, In you is {{trembling}} and fusing The {{creation of a}} new-patterned dream, dream of a [...] generation: <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> to see the Creator, the power that [...] patterns the dream.|$|E
60|$|I've {{tried to}} define it, but what mother's son Could ever yet {{do what he}} knows should be done? My rocket has burst, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> in the air Its fast-fading heart's-blood drop back in despair; Yet one chance is left me, and, if I am quick, I can palm off, before you suspect me, the stick.|$|E
60|$|Then he {{sank back}} {{in one of}} the high-backed chairs <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> him, frightened.|$|R
60|$|There's an {{improved}} Mergenthaler in New York; Paige <b>and</b> Davis <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> it two whole afternoons.|$|R

6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] {{answered}} the Bee with a laugh. [...] "Do you not know, then, {{that this is}} the place where faithless women, or girls who have loved without the leave of the king, are brought to meet their death, and with them their accomplices. Oh! they die here thus each day, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> them die and keep the count of the number of them," [...] and drawing a tally-stick from the thatch of the hut, she took a knife and added a notch to the many that appeared upon it, looking at Nahoon the while with a half-questioning, half-warning gaze.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought it," [...] {{she said}} with a musical laugh, [...] "although at this place I rust and grow dull like an unused sword. Now you would rest. Go--all of you. To-morrow you and I will talk alone. Fear nothing for your safety; you are watched by my slaves <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> my slaves. Until to-morrow, then, farewell. Go now, eat and sleep, as alas we all must do who linger on this ball of earth and cling to a life we should do well to lose. Billali, lead them hence," [...] and she waved her hand to signify that the {{audience}} was ended.|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly so," [...] said John. [...] "And in {{my garden}} I garner up God's gifts; and I select the best, and then {{the best of the}} best, and so on and on; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>watch,</b> oh, so carefully, for {{everything}} hurtful; and I water; and I prune off the dead branches; and enrich the ground. And so I work and work, with God's help of the sunshine and the rain; and at last, when it all comes to what we see to-day, I cannot but feel that God is pleased with me for bringing about the fruition he knew I could accomplish with the material given by what some people call nature and I call God. That is what a garden is for, and in that way it glorifies him." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{got into}} the barn unperceived, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> him climb the ladder to the loft. Then I went indoors to tell them.|$|R
5000|$|... "Could <b>I</b> go out <b>and</b> make a ton {{of money}} in my {{businesses}} and law firm? Sure. But when I'm 70 years old, I look in the mirror <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> this place crumble ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Dear friend, indeed, yes. What {{you would}} say would only agitate and disturb Corisande. Her {{character}} is not yet formed, and its future is perplexing, at least to me," [...] murmured the mother. [...] "She has not the simple nature of her sisters. It is a deeper and more complicated mind, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> its development with fond, but anxious interest." [...] Then, in a lighter tone, she added, [...] "You do not know very much of us. Try to know more. Everybody under this roof views you with regard, {{and you are the}} brother friend of our eldest son. Wherever we are, you will always find a home; but do not touch again upon this subject, at least at present, for it distresses me." [...] And then she took his arm, and pressed it, and by this time they had gained the croquet-ground.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Sir George," [...] {{observed}} the gentleman alluded to, [...] "I do not attribute my respect for your country, in the least, to origin. I endeavour {{to keep myself}} free from all sorts of prejudices. My admiration of England arises from conviction, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> all her movements with the utmost jealousy, {{in order to see}} if I cannot find her tripping, though I feel bound to say I have never yet detected her in a single error. What a very different picture, France--I hope your governess is not within hearing, Miss Eve; it is not her fault; she was born a French woman, and we would not wish to hurt her feelings--but what a different picture France presents! I have watched her narrowly too, these forty years, I may say, and I have never yet found her right; and this, you must allow, is a great deal to be said by one who is thoroughly impartial." ...|$|E
60|$|Long, {{long hours}} did Marble <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> the {{progress}} of our ship that day and the succeeding night, each of us taking our tricks at the wheel, and doing seaman's duty, {{as well as that}} of mate and master. All this time, the vessel was dashing furiously out towards the Atlantic, which she reached ere the morning of the succeeding day. Just before he light returned we were whirled past a large ship that was lying-to, under a single storm-stay-sail, and which I recognised as the frigate that had taken a look at us at our anchorage. The cutter was close at hand, and the fearful manner in which these two strong-handed vessels pitched and lurched, gave me some idea of what must be our situation, should we be compelled to luff to the wind. I supposed they had done so, in order to keep as long as possible, on their cruising ground, near the chops of the Irish channel.|$|E
6000|$|... "For certain {{reasons it}} is not {{necessary}} for me to explain," [...] Mark said, [...] "I went to that place for the first time tonight, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> the play between you and Mr. Emerson." ...|$|R
60|$|I said I was. If the {{question}} had concerned Aztec relics my answer would undoubtedly {{have been the}} same. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> him, dazedly, while he took down a silver porringer from the shallow mantel shelf.|$|R
60|$|GEOFFREY. You {{said you}} couldn't trust Margery, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> her <b>and</b> {{followed}} her into the woods, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> lost her <b>and</b> went on <b>and</b> on till <b>I</b> found the light and the lady, and she says she can make you sleep o' nights.|$|R
60|$|Aug. 20.--Butterflies and butterflies, (taking {{the place}} of the bumble-bees of three months since, who have quite disappear'd,) {{continue}} to flit to and fro, all sorts, white, yellow, brown, purple--now and then some gorgeous fellow flashing lazily by on wings like artists' palettes dabb'd with every color. Over the breast of the pond I notice many white ones, crossing, pursuing their idle capricious flight. Near where I sit grows a tall-stemm'd weed topt with a profusion of rich scarlet blossoms, on which the snowy insects alight and dally, sometimes four or five of them at a time. By-and-by a humming-bird visits the same, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> him coming and going, daintily balancing and shimmering about. These white butterflies give new beautiful contrasts to the pure greens of the August foliage, (we have had some copious rains lately,) and over the glistening bronze of the pond-surface. You can tame even such insects; I have one big and handsome moth down here, knows and comes to me, likes me to hold him up on my extended hand.|$|E
60|$|Several {{weeks of}} {{darkness}} pass after this. For the Moon has gone out. The very dogs are still, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> {{for the first}} light of the dawn before making my way homeward. Again the noise of shuffling feet. The morning call is about to begin, and my night watch is over. 'Allah ho Akbar! Allah ho Akbar!' The east grows gray, and presently saffron; the dawn wind comes up as though the Muezzin had summoned it; and, as one man, the City of Dreadful Night rises from its bed and turns its face towards the dawning day. With return of life comes return of sound. First a low whisper, then a deep bass hum; for {{it must be remembered}} that the entire city is on the house-tops. My eyelids weighed down with the arrears of long deferred sleep, I escape from the Minar through the courtyard and out into the square beyond, where the sleepers have risen, stowed away the bedsteads, and are discussing the morning hookah. The minute's freshness of the air has gone, and it is as hot as at first.|$|E
6000|$|As I have said, {{that part}} of M. Comte's {{writings}} which deals with the philosophy of physical science appeared to me to possess singularly little value, and {{to show that he}} had but the most superficial, and merely second-hand, knowledge of most branches of what is usually understood by science. I do not mean by this merely to say that Comte was behind our present knowledge, or that he was unacquainted with the details of the science of his own day. No one could justly make such defects cause of complaint in a philosophical writer of the past generation. What struck me was his want of apprehension of the great features of science; his strange mistakes as to the merits of his scientific contemporaries; and his ludicrously erroneous notions about the part which some of the scientific doctrines current in his time were destined to play in the future. With these impressions in my mind, no one will be surprised if I acknowledge that, for these sixteen years, it has been a periodical source of irritation to me to find M. Comte put forward as a representative of scientific thought; and to observe that writers whose philosophy had its legitimate parent in Hume, or in themselves, were labelled [...] "Comtists" [...] or [...] "Positivists" [...] by public writers, even in spite of vehement protests to the contrary. It has cost Mr. Mill hard rubbings to get that label off; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> Mr. Spencer, as one regards a good man struggling with adversity, still engaged in eluding its adhesiveness, and ready to tear away skin and all, rather than let it stick. My own turn might come next; and, therefore, when an eminent prelate the other day gave currency and authority to the popular confusion, I took an opportunity of incidentally revindicating Hume's property in the so-called [...] "New Philosophy," [...] and, at the same time, of repudiating Comtism on my own behalf.[13] ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> had saddled <b>and</b> bridled {{the single}} horse which had evidently been {{overlooked}} by the royal household in its flight, and, standing a little {{back in the}} shadow of the stable's interior, Victory <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> the surging throng without.|$|R
60|$|As {{for the man}} himself, my conduct had not {{disturbed}} him in the slightest. I {{was prepared}} for I knew not what violent visitation from this terrible stranger, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> him warily while he considered me with the utmost gravity.|$|R
60|$|Fifanti {{rose and}} set a chair for him, smiling a crooked smile that held more hostility than welcome. None the less did his {{excellency}} pay Madonna Giuliana a thousand compliments as he took his seat, supremely calm and easy in his manner. <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> him closely, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> Giuliana, a queer fresh uneasiness pervading me.|$|R
6000|$|The High-Queen of the Island of Woods {{had died}} in childbirth, and her child was put to nurse {{with a woman who}} lived in a hut of mud and wicker, within the border of the wood. One night the woman sat rocking the cradle, and pondering over the beauty of the child, and praying that the gods might grant him wisdom equal to his beauty. There came a knock at the door, and she got up, not a little wondering, for the nearest {{neighbours}} were in the dun of the High- King a mile away; and the night was now late. 'Who is knocking?' she cried, and a thin voice answered, 'Open! for I am a crone of the grey hawk, and I come from the darkness of the great wood.' In terror she drew back the bolt, and a grey-clad woman, of a great age, and of a height more than human, came in and stood by the head of the cradle. The nurse shrank back against the wall, unable to take her eyes from the woman, for she saw by the gleaming of the firelight that the feathers of the grey hawk were upon her head instead of hair. But the child slept, and the fire danced, for the one was too ignorant and the other too full of gaiety to know what a dreadful being stood there. 'Open!' cried another voice, 'for I am a crone of the grey hawk, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> over his nest {{in the darkness of the}} great wood.' The nurse opened the door again, though her fingers could scarce hold the bolts for trembling, and another grey woman, not less old than the other, and with like feathers instead of hair, came in and stood by the first. In a little, came a third grey woman, and after her a fourth, and then another and another and another, until the hut was full of their immense bodies. They stood a long time in perfect silence and stillness, for they were of those whom the dropping of the sand has never troubled, but at last one muttered in a low thin voice: 'Sisters, I knew him far away by the redness of his heart under his silver skin'; and then another spoke: 'Sisters, I knew him because his heart fluttered like a bird under a net of silver cords '; and then another took up the word: 'Sisters, I knew him because his heart sang like a bird that is happy in a silver cage.' And after that they sang together, those who were nearest rocking the cradle with long wrinkled fingers; and their voices were now tender and caressing, now like the wind blowing in the great wood, and this was their song: ...|$|E
