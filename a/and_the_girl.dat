5|$|Kidd's first choreography on Broadway was for E.Y. Harburg's Finian's Rainbow, a lyrical musical that {{explored}} racial prejudice. Kidd won {{his first}} Tony Award for that play.

Next came Arms <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Girl</b> (1950), directed by Rouben Mamoulian, with Pearl Bailey and Nanette Fabray, also a flop.|$|E

5|$|After seeing Nankiwi in the plane, a {{small group}} of Huaorani decided to make the trip to Palm Beach, and left the {{following}} morning, January 7. On the way, they encountered Nankiwi <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl,</b> returning unescorted. The girl's brother, Nampa, was furious at this, and to defuse the situation and divert attention from himself, Nankiwi claimed that the foreigners had attacked them on the beach, and in their haste to flee, they had been separated from their chaperone. Gikita, {{a senior member of the}} group whose experience with outsiders had taught him that they could not be trusted, recommended that they kill the foreigners. The return of the older woman and her account of the friendliness of the missionaries was not enough to dissuade them, and they soon continued toward the beach.|$|E
5|$|Dale {{has also}} made several film appearances. He {{appeared}} as the Romulan Praetor Hiren in Star Trek Nemesis, a part he got after the actor originally cast fell ill, and had small parts in films such as Hollywood Homicide, After the Sunset, and the minor part of General Ross in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Dale said his script for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was printed on tin foil so {{it was impossible to}} replicate, {{in order to keep the}} film's plot a secret. He appeared in four films released in 2011: A Little Bit of Heaven, Priest, Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Girl</b> with the Dragon Tattoo, having joined late in the film's production.|$|E
5|$|Gautier thought Heine's Wilis and Hugo's fifteen-year-old Spanish {{girl would}} make a good ballet story. His first idea was to present an empty ballroom {{glittering}} with crystal and candlelight. The Wilis would cast a spell over the floor. Giselle and other dancers would enter and whirl through the room, unable to resist the spell to keep them dancing. Giselle would try to keep her lover from partnering other girls. The Queen of the Wilis would enter, lay her cold hand on Giselle's heart <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> would drop dead.|$|E
50|$|The scene changes {{again with}} <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> {{now in a}} city, rain falling heavily. Another large whale breaks through {{although}} this time through a road <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> stop as Lena points toward it. The city becomes bright and clear of rain and airplanes soar in the distance. A plane approaches, driving across <b>the</b> road, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> walk under it. <b>The</b> <b>girls</b> are then back in a rainy scene where their mouths sync with the words sang, but their actions move backward until they freeze. Again in the clear city, a train passes very quickly as <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> approach <b>the</b> track <b>and</b> in slow motion <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> recoil <b>and</b> begin to fall backward. As they hit the pavement, it splashes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> sink into {{it as if it}} were water.|$|R

5|$|The {{historical}} {{evidence suggests that}} Lochner's paintings were well known and widely copied during his lifetime, and remained so until the 16th century. Early examples in ink after his Virgin in Adoration are in the British Museum and École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts. The influence of Lochner's Last Judgement {{can be seen in}} Hans Memling's Gdansk altarpiece, where the gates of Heaven are similar, as is the rendering of the blessed. Albrecht Dürer knew of him before his stay in Cologne, and Van der Weyden saw his paintings during his travel to Italy. The latter's Altar of Saint John is similar to Lochner's Flaying of Bartholomew, especially in the executioner's pose, while his Saint Columba altarpiece includes two motifs from Lochner's Adoration of the Magi triptych; specifically, the king in the central panel {{with his back to the}} viewer, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> in the right hand wing holding a basket containing doves.|$|E
