If circumstances allowed, nearby lead <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> mines would also be objectives. Although the railroad, lead mine, <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> mine were obvious targets, communications sent by General Scammon were in code. Thus, exact details of the plan were known by few.|$|E

5|$|Salt {{may have}} been used for barter in {{connection}} with the obsidian trade in Anatolia in the Neolithic Era. Herodotus described salt trading routes across Libya back in the 5th century BC. In {{the early years of the}} Roman Empire, roads such as the Via Salaria were built for the transportation of salt from the salt pans of Ostia to the capital. Salt was included among funeral offerings found in ancient Egyptian tombs from the third millennium BC, as were salted birds, <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> fish. From about 2800 BC, the Egyptians began exporting salt fish to the Phoenicians in return for Lebanon cedar, glass, and the dye Tyrian purple; the Phoenicians traded Egyptian salt fish <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> from North Africa throughout their Mediterranean trade empire.|$|E

5|$|When {{the second}} {{version of the}} story was {{translated}} into English by Michael Turner and Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper, they made a number of alterations to the text. For instance, Monsieur Tom Hawake, whose name was a pun on tomahawk, was renamed Mr. Maurice Oyle, and the Slift factory was renamed Grynd Corp. Other changes were made to render the story more culturally understandable to an Anglophone readership; whereas the factory originally sold its mix of dogs, cats, and rats as hare pâté—a food uncommon in Britain—the English translation rendered the mix as salami. In another instance, garlic, pepper, <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> were added to the mixture in the French version, but this was changed to mustard, pepper, <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> for the English version, again reflecting British culinary tastes.|$|E

5|$|Acquacotta {{was invented}} in part {{as a means to}} make stale, {{hardened}} bread edible.

Acquacotta was prepared and used to marinate the stale bread, thus softening it.|$|E

5|$|As Gotō's ships {{endeavored}} to escape, Scott's ships tightened their formation {{and then turned}} to pursue the retreating Japanese warships. At 00:06, two torpedoes from Kinugasa barely missed Boise. Boise <b>and</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake City turned on their searchlights to help target the Japanese ships, giving Kinugasas gunners clear targets. At 00:10, two shells from Kinugasa exploded in Boises main ammunition magazine between turrets one and two. The resulting explosion killed almost 100 men and threatened to blow the ship apart. Seawater rushed in through rents in her hull opened by the explosion and helped quench the fire before it could explode the ship's powder magazines. Boise immediately sheered out of the column and retreated from the action. Kinugasa <b>and</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake City exchanged fire with each other, each hitting the other several times, causing minor damage to Kinugasa and damaging one of Salt Lake Citys boilers, reducing her speed.|$|E
