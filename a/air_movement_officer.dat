50|$|In early March 1943, she {{received}} {{an invitation to}} a preliminary interview with an officer of SOE F Section, and on 18 March began her training at Wanborough Manor. On 16 June 1943 she was flown to a location north-east of Angers, in the Loire Valley, in occupied France with fellow-agents Noor Inayat Khan and Cecily Lefort, where they were met by Henri Dericourt, the <b>air</b> <b>movements</b> <b>officer</b> for F section. From there, she made her way to St. Amour where she was assigned to the Acrobat network, led by John Renshaw Starr. Her duties included acting as a courier, delivering messages to other agents and members of the underground in Marseille, Lyon, and Paris. She also helped agent Harry Rée plan the destruction of the Peugeot factory at Sochaux, where tank turrets and aircraft engine parts were made. A month after Rowden's arrival, network leader Starr was arrested. Rowden and wireless operator John Cuthbert Young took refuge with a French family at the village of Clairvaux-les-Lacs, near Lons-le-Saunier. Her papers showed her name as Juliette Therese Rondeau and her field name among fellow agents was Paulette.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the impact of <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> through {{building}} constructions. The method of solution was as follows: First, selection of a common building construction type. A 2 D construction related with common exercise 1 was selected. Second, modeling and simulation of heat and moisture transport of three cases: (1) without <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> through the construction, (2) with dominant <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> from the outside to the interior and (3) vice versa. The used internal and external boundary conditions (i. e. temperature, humidity and wind induced pressures) were based on a typical Dutch climate. Third, evaluation of the results. The paper presents the details of the mentioned method and a discussion of the results. It is concluded that (as expected) the heat characteristic of the studied building construction is only minor affected by <b>air</b> <b>movement.</b> However, <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> might have more impact on the moisture characteristic as presumed so far...|$|R

The research focuses {{on the effect of}} <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> through building constructions. Although the typical <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> inside building constructions is quite small (velocity is of order ~ 10 - 5 m/s), this research shows it might have much more impact on the moisture characteristic as presumed so far. Our results indicate that especially vapor transport is in our case study very sensitive for <b>air</b> <b>movement.</b> As much as 40 % Rh change at the inner surfaces of the building constructions are observed if we take <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> into account. Concerning the simulations tool, it is concluded that the use of the COMSOL Multiphysics software enables and simplifies the research of possible important effects that are not included in other standard heat and moisture simulation tools...|$|R

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>movement</b> {{is one of}} the six main {{variables}} determirzing human thermal comfort; air temperature, relative humidity, mean radiant temperature, metabolic rate, {{and clothing}} insulation are the others. Recently, HVACde sign in;zovations, energy conservation concerns, and new laboratory data on fan cooling and drafts have brought substantial ~tttention to the issue of acceptable levels of <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> in qO’ice environments. Thermal comjort standards for indoor occupancy include <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> limits that are constructed from often conflicting evidence and are frequently difficult to apply. A primary reason is that, while <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> can provide desirable cooling in "warm" conditions, it can also increase the risk of unacceptably cool drafts. The transition zone from desirable cooling to uncomfortable draft is a complicated function of physics, physiology, and human expectation. This work focuses on <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> for cooling in the expected temperature range, 25. 5 °C to 28 [...] 5 °C, of this transition zone. Fifty-four human subjects were given control of the air supply velocity from a desk fan (FAN), a floor-mounted diffuser (FMD). and a desk-mounted diffuser (DMD) single ambient air temperature. The subjects were asked to adjust the <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> as they pleased to make themselves comfortable. These tests encompassed the full temperature range of the "transition zone," 25. 5 °C to 28. 5 °C. Physical measurements of the environment were made and subjective votes collected, including thermal sensation, thermal preference, wor. ’~ area preferences, personal control preferences, and health characteristics.

40|$|In the ASHRAE comfort {{database}} [1], underpinning the North American naturally ventilated adaptive comfort standard [2], {{the mean}} indoor air velocity associated with 90 % thermal acceptability was relatively low, rarely exceeding 0. 3 m/s. Post hoc studies of this database {{showed that the}} main complaint related to <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> was a preference for more <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> [3, 4]. These observations suggest the potential to shift thermal acceptability to even higher operative temperature values, if higher air speeds are available. If that were the case, would it be reasonable to expect temperature and <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> acceptability levels at 90 %? This paper focuses on this question and combines thermal and <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> acceptability percentages {{in order to assess}} occupants. Two field experiments took place in naturally ventilated buildings located on Brazil's North-East. The fundamental feature of this research design is the proximity of the indoor climate observations with corresponding comfort questionnaire responses from the occupants. Almost 90 % thermal acceptability was found within the predictions of the ASHRAE adaptive comfort standard and yet occupants required 'more air velocity'. Minimum air velocity values were found in order to achieve 90 % of thermal and <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> acceptability. From 24 to 27 degrees C the minimum air velocity for thermal and <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> acceptability is 0. 4 m/s: from 27 to 29 degrees C is 0. 41 - 0. 8 m/s, and from 29 to 31 degrees C is > 0. 81 m/s. These results highlight the necessity of combining thermal and <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> acceptability in order to assess occupants' perception of their indoor thermal environment in hot humid climates. 7 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Personalized Ventilation (PV) {{has been}} shown to improve inhaled air quality recently. However, it may lead to dissatisfaction such as draft due to {{personalized}} air applied locally to the facial region, or stuffiness due to inadequate air supply. This study aims to identify some reasons for the dissatisfaction among tropically acclimatized people through a systematically experimental design. In this study 24 subjects were subjected to a series of random facial exposure to local <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> each of 15 minutes duration in a well-controlled indoor air quality chamber. The exposures comprise various combinations of PV supply temperatures (21 to 26 °C), ambient temperatures (23. 5 and 26 °C) and PV air supply velocities (0. 15 to 0. 9 m/s). The study shows that among those who are dissatisfied and preferred less <b>air</b> <b>movement,</b> about 85 % attributed their dissatisfaction to draft or perception of too much <b>air</b> <b>movement.</b> Drying effects contributed only secondarily to the dissatisfaction (less than 10 %). Among those who are dissatisfied and preferred more <b>air</b> <b>movement,</b> more than 70 % attributed the dissatisfaction to insufficient cooling or perception of too little <b>air</b> <b>movement.</b> <b>Air</b> quality accounted for less than 5 % of the dissatisfaction.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis has {{the purpose}} to visualize and document the <b>air</b> <b>movements</b> provided by different ventilation principles in an operating theatre. The visualization {{will be made}} {{as simple as possible}} in a physical model. The model and the documentation should be able to use in educational purposes. The study is based on the two most common systems for airflow, currently used in operating theatres. The first principle is displacement ventilation in which the air is supplied at low velocity along the floor. The second principle is vertical parallel laminar airflow in which the air is compressed like a piston from ceiling to the floor. A review of literature resulted in the choice of size, design, and scale factor for the model, as well as choices of ventilation principles and airflows. When the model was completely built and ready to use the <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> were made visible with smoke. The visualization of the <b>air</b> <b>movements</b> was documented with videos. The series of experiments with vertical parallel airflow give a result of <b>air</b> <b>movements,</b> which looks reasonably the same for the different tested velocities of the supply air. The air is forced down over the operating table, and forming a sterile zone, obtaining the form of a cylinder around and over the table. Between {{the outer edge of the}} sterile zone and the walls the smoke accumulates in air eddies. The experiments with displacement ventilation provides a visualization of the <b>air</b> <b>movements</b> that spreads from the diffusers in the corners to the operating table via the floor, and then rise in a more turbulent pattern of movement towards the exhaust diffuser in the ceiling. The visualization of the two air supply principles in the model leads to the following conclusions: The model is suitable to visualize the <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> arising from the principle of vertical parallel airflow. The visualization of <b>air</b> <b>movements</b> with displacement ventilation will be more realistic if the experiments were made with lowered velocity of the supply air, if the supply air is colder than the air in the operating theatre and if heat sources are placed in the room. The model can be easily understood and used to visualize <b>air</b> <b>movements</b> in an operating theatre. The model can be used to give hospital staff a better idea of the importance of the ventilation in operation theatres. Eddies in the <b>air</b> <b>movements</b> are a problem in all experiments. Less eddies are detected at higher air velocities and with partial exhaust at roof height. To sort out what impact eddies have on protection ventilation requires more studies focusing on this factor. A continued development of the model will make the visualizations of the <b>air</b> <b>movements</b> in the model more realistic...|$|R
