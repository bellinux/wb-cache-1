50|$|He is commemorated in {{the names}} of a number of animals, {{including}} Fischer's lovebird, <b>Agapornis</b> <b>fischeri.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Fischer's lovebird (<b>Agapornis</b> <b>fischeri)</b> {{is a small}} parrot {{species of}} the Agapornis genus. They were {{originally}} discovered in the late 19th century, and were first bred in the United States in 1926. They are named after German explorer Gustav Fischer.|$|E
50|$|The sexes of <b>Agapornis</b> <b>fischeri</b> appear the same, and are {{distinguished}} {{with certainty}} through DNA testing, and less certainly by their habits in perching. Generally, females sit with their legs farther apart than males because the female pelvis is wider.|$|E
50|$|Lovebirds of {{different}} species can mate and produce both sterile and fertile hybrid offspring, for example Agapornis personatus mate with <b>Agapornis</b> <b>fischeri</b> will produce fertile hybrid offspring. These offspring have behaviors of both parents. It is recommended to only place birds {{of the same}} species together, or of the same sex for this reason.|$|E
50|$|Eastern Rwanda, by contrast, {{features}} savanna birds {{such as the}} black-headed gonolek {{and those}} associated with swamps and lakes, including storks and cranes. Further, according to the Avi Base Organization, the globally endangered species are 9 and species introduced are 3 {{out of a total}} of 692 species as of 2012.Balaeniceps rex (shoebill) and <b>Agapornis</b> <b>fischeri</b> (Fischer's lovebird) are also reported.|$|E
50|$|The faunal species {{reported}} are 163 {{species of}} vertebrates, 52 species of reptiles, 56 species of amphibians and 215 fish species. It is {{also reported that}} at high altitudes, endemicity is distinct in 17 species of mammals and 22 species of birds. Lake Tanganyika has 200 species of fish and {{an equal number of}} molluscs. A scientific exploration team of the University of Texas at El Paso found the Bururi long-fingered frog (Cardioglossa cyaneospila) (considered extinct for decades), in December 2011 in the Bururi Forest Nature Reserve, after it was last seen in 1949. Seven important species of fauna reported are Genetta piscivora (aquatic genet), Serinus mozambicus (yellow-fronted canary), Cercopithecus lhoesti (L'hoest's monkey), <b>Agapornis</b> <b>fischeri</b> (Fischer's lovebird), Galago moholi (South African galago), Hyperolius viridiflavus, and Hippopotamus amphibius (hippopotamus).|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} bill {{structure}} on seed preference and handling time in granivorous birds was determined for a long, slender dove bill, a conical finch bill, and a hooked parrot bill using diamond doves (husked seeds prior to ingestion; lovebirds took significantly longer than Java sparrows in handling all seed species. Seed characteristics, {{size and shape}} affected handling time with reference to bill structure. Diamond doves took significantly longer to handle elongate seeds while Java sparrows handled round seeds slowly and Fischer’s lovebirds required similar handling times for all seed species. Java sparrows and Fischer’s lovebirds selected greater proportions of the same seed species, suggesting that birds which husk seeds prefer similar seed species. Seeds were not selected according to nutritional intake rate. Japanese millet was the preferred seed species of Fischer’s lovebirds and Java sparrows, but provided few calories and little protein per unit time. Seed selection was influenced by bill structure, as seeds were selected, amongst others, according to handling time, and handling time was dependent on bill structure. Geopelia cuneata), Java sparrows (Padda oryzivora) and Fisher’s lovebirds (<b>Agapornis</b> <b>fischeri).</b> Four seed species were used during trials: white millet (Panicum miliaceum), red manna (P. maximum), canary seed (Phalaris canariensis) and Japanese millet (Echinochloa frumentacea). Diamond doves handled all seed species significantly faster than sparrows and lovebirds, as they swallow seeds whole. Java sparrows and Fischer’s lovebirds </strong...|$|E
40|$|A six-year-old female Fischer's lovebird (<b>Agapornis</b> <b>fischeri)</b> {{presented}} at necropsy with a cutaneous mass on the neck, 3. 5 cm in diameter, yielding and with blood content. Histopathological findings showed a neoplasm characterized by proliferation of vascular endothelial cells. The histology {{of the mass}} revealed a multinodular, focally infiltrating tumor. Deeper dermal nodules were made of spindle cells forming vascular slits reminiscent of the histology seen in Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). More superficially located dermal nodules consisted of small blood vessels, with histology resembling capillary hemangioma. The spindle cells and capillaries were strongly positive for Vimentin, endothelial cell marker CD 31, and negative for sarcomeric α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Intravascular platelet trapping and Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) -positive hyaline globules were also observed. Differential diagnosis included Kaposi's sarcoma, capillary haemangioma, spindle cell haemangioendothelioma, and epithelioid haemangioendothelioma. Based on morphological and immunohistochemical findings, the tumor was diagnosed as a cutaneous Kaposiform haemangioendothelioma (KHE), a rare, low-grade malignant vascular neoplasm. Other organs showed no abnormalities. PCR amplifications, conducted using Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) -specific primers and degenerate sets of primers designed to detect and characterize members of the Herpesviridae, on DNA extracted from tumor tissue and from whole blood failed to amplify any KSHV-related sequence. Moreover, no specific signal was obtained using primers for detection of psittacine herpesvirus, known {{to be linked to}} Pacheco's disease in parrots. To the best of our knowledge, this unusual case is the third report of KHE in a non-human animal species, the first described in a bird...|$|E
