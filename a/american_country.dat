5|$|Many Belgians {{were highly}} {{critical}} of the magazine due to its connections with Hergé, who was still deemed a collaborator and traitor by many; La Soir and La Cité publicly criticised the decision without referring to him by name while Le Quotidien and Le Drapeau Rouge specifically singled him out for denunciation. Hergé believed that the children's author Jeanne Cappe was behind many of these accusations, and threatened her with a lawsuit. Unhappy with life in Belgium, Hergé made plans to emigrate to Argentina, a nation that was welcoming many Europeans who had supported the defeated Axis powers and which had a thriving comic book scene. Ultimately, he changed his mind, for reasons that have remained unknown; it is possible that he was unable to secure any promise of work in the South <b>American</b> <b>country.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractEven though several Latin <b>American</b> <b>countries</b> {{have shown}} {{recently}} poor economic performance, {{many of them}} have accumulated foreign exchange reserves from 2006 onwards. Conventionally, three reasons are given for international reserves accumulation: (1) payment of short-term debt, (2) payment of at least three months of imports, and (3) protection for an outflow of capital. However, the majority of the Latin <b>American</b> <b>countries</b> meet all three criteria. Why then do some Latin <b>American</b> <b>countries</b> continue to accumulate reserves? Our answer is that for some governments, hoarding might represent a social expression of wealth, following Marx's idea...|$|R

5|$|Williams set out {{the case}} against utilitarianism – a consequentialist {{position}} the simplest version {{of which is that}} actions are right only insofar as they promote the greatest happiness of the greatest number– in Utilitarianism: For and Against (1973) with J. J. C. Smart. One of the book's thought experiments involves Jim, a botanist doing research in a South <b>American</b> <b>country</b> led by a brutal dictator. Jim finds himself in a small town facing 20 captured Indian rebels. The captain who has arrested them says that if Jim will kill one, the others will be released in honour of Jim's status as a guest, but if he does not, they will all be killed. Simple act utilitarianism would favour Jim killing one of the men.|$|E
