This intervention continues until today. The Japanese government focuses on a competitive export market, and tries to ensure a low yen value through a trade surplus. The Plaza Accord of 1985 temporarily changed this situation from its average of ¥239 per US$1 in 1985 to ¥128 in 1988 {{and led to a}} peak value of ¥80 against the U.S. dollar in 1995, effectively increasing the value of Japan’s GDP to almost that of the United States. Since that time, however, the yen has greatly decreased in value.

50|$|If {{there is}} no {{hysteresis}} in unemployment, then for example if the central bank wishes to lower the inflation rate it may shift to a contractionary monetary policy, which if not fully anticipated and believed will temporarily increase the unemployment rate; if the contractionary policy persists, the unemployment rise will eventually disappear as the unemployment rate returns to the natural rate. Then {{the cost of the}} <b>anti-inflation</b> <b>policy</b> will have been temporary unemployment. But if there is hysteresis, the unemployment rise initiated by the contractionary policy will never completely go away, and in this case the cost of the <b>anti-inflation</b> <b>policy</b> will have been permanently higher unemployment, making the policy less likely to have greater benefits than costs.|$|E
5000|$|This {{stagflation}} {{meant that}} both expansionary (anti-recession) and contractionary (<b>anti-inflation)</b> <b>policies</b> {{had to be}} applied simultaneously, a clear impossibility.

5000|$|The {{short-term}} {{effects of}} monetary policy can {{be influenced by}} the degree to which announcements of new policy are deemed credible. In particular, when an <b>anti-inflation</b> <b>policy</b> is announced by a central bank, in the absence of credibility {{in the eyes of the}} public inflationary expectations will not drop, and the short-run effect of the announcement and a subsequent sustained <b>anti-inflation</b> <b>policy</b> is likely to be a combination of somewhat lower inflation and higher unemployment (see Phillips curve#NAIRU and rational expectations). But if the policy announcement is deemed credible, inflationary expectations will drop commensurately with the announced policy intent, and inflation is likely to come down more quickly and without so much of a cost in terms of unemployment.|$|E
50|$|Thus {{there can}} be an {{advantage}} to having the central bank be independent of the political authority, to shield it from the prospect of political pressure to reverse {{the direction of the}} policy. But even with a seemingly independent central bank, a central bank whose hands are not tied to the <b>anti-inflation</b> <b>policy</b> might be deemed as not fully credible; in this case there is an advantage to be had by the central bank being in some way bound to follow through on its policy pronouncements, lending it credibility.|$|E

50|$|However, {{with the}} oil shock of 1973, and the {{economic}} problems of the 1970s, Keynesian economics began {{to fall out of}} favour. During this time, many economies experienced high and rising unemployment, coupled with high and rising inflation, contradicting the Phillips curve's prediction. This stagflation meant that the simultaneous application of expansionary (anti-recession) and contractionary (<b>anti-inflation)</b> <b>policies</b> appeared to be necessary. This dilemma led {{to the end of the}} Keynesian near-consensus of the 1960s, and the rise throughout the 1970s of ideas based upon more classical analysis, including monetarism, supply-side economics, and new classical economics.|$|R
40|$|Most economists {{looking ahead}} to 1970 expect the rate of {{inflation}} to slow as the effects of government 2 ̆ 7 s <b>anti-inflation</b> <b>policies</b> begin to show up in the prices of the goods and services each of us buys and sells. Inflation is defined as a sustained rise in some broad based index of prices, so the effects of the policies designed to slow the current inflation will not become apparent until the indexes show a slower rate of increase. In the less inflationary environment for 1970 that I and others envision, many prices will continue to rise but, on the average, the rise will be smaller than in 1969...|$|R
5000|$|In addition, the {{hysteresis}} hypothesis {{says that}} the NAIRU does not stay the same over time—and can change due to economic policy. A persistently low unemployment rate {{makes it easier for}} those workers who are unemployed for [...] "mismatch" [...] reasons to move to where the jobs are and/or to attain the training necessary for the available vacancies (often by getting those jobs and receiving on-the-job training). On the other hand, high unemployment makes it more difficult for those workers to adjust, while hurting their morale, job-seeking skills, and the value of their work skills. Thus, some economists argue that British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's <b>anti-inflation</b> <b>policies</b> using persistently high unemployment led to higher mismatch or structural unemployment and a higher NAIRU.|$|R

40|$|Although {{even before}} the end of World War II the world was {{preparing}} itself to fight a relapse into stagnation, the harrowing role inflation was to have as a constant in the post-war economic scene was scarcely perceived.

40|$|Inflation at {{the time}} of the 1992 {{election}} was at its lowest level in 20 years. This fact might have been expected to give the incumbent Administration a significant advantage, since most previous research regarding voters’ economic preferences has found that American voters have a strong preference for low inflation and a great willingness to tolerate unemployment to reduce inflation. Thus, the 1992 election results raise the possibility that voter preferences either have changed or were mistakenly estimated earlier.; The author’s goal is to obtain some estimates of the policies and inflation goals that voters deem optimal. He then uses these estimates of voters’ preferred policy outcomes to determine the price that voters are willing to pay to achieve their desired inflation rate. His findings suggest that strong <b>anti-inflation</b> <b>policies</b> are politically quite feasible. Inflation (Finance) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} an aggressive price stabilizing (antiinflation) policy {{on the ability of}} citizens to achieve rational expectations equilibrium (REE) forecasts of inflation. Inflation does not persist when citizens have rational expectations forecasts. In using policy to assist citizens in achieving REE forecasts, policymakers also reduce inflation persistence. An aggressive <b>anti-inflation</b> <b>policy</b> tack consists of (among other things) a willingness to respond more forcefully to deviations from an inflation target. Using an adaptive learning framework, we develop a model that uses a real contracting rigidity in conjunction with an interest rate rule and an IS-curve. The model equilibrium indicates that only an aggressive <b>anti-inflation</b> <b>policy</b> enables citizens to learn the REE inflation forecast. The model also shows that inflation persistence has a negative relationship with policy aggressiveness. We test the model using quarterly inflation data for the period 1960 to 2000. The results indicate that policy becomes aggressive in the early 1980 s. A substantial reduction in inflation persistence follows this change in policy...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the Federal Reserve’s failure to control {{inflation}} during the 1970 s was due to constraints imposed by the political environment.

Alternative explanations, in particular misperceptions of the natural rate of unemployment and misunderstandings of the nature of inflation, do not provide a complete explanation for Fed policy at key turning points during the Great Inflation. Evidence for this explanation of Fed behavior is found in Minutes and Transcripts of FOMC meetings and speeches of Fed chairmen.

40|$|Using {{evidence}} from seven hyperinflationary episodes in four Latin American {{countries in the}} second half of the 1980 s, John Rogers and Ping Wang examine the causes and consequences of high inflation. The article emphasizes four issues: the welfare costs of inflation and real costs of stabilization, the common features of the chronically high inflations experienced in Latin American countries, the main causes of high inflation, and the widely different outcomes of several stabilization programs.; Rogers and Wang find that the welfare costs of even moderate periods of inflation may not be negligible, whereas the adverse macroeconomic effects of stabilization efforts are mostly temporary. The authors show that the spiral-like adjustment of the government budget and monetary growth may result in a high-inflation trap. The main causes of chronically high inflation include continuous fiscal-monetary extension, productivity slowdown, systematic undervaluation of the domestic currency, and diminished credibility of <b>anti-inflation</b> <b>policies.</b> Successful stabilization, in essence, results from budgetary adjustment, market liberalization, and the adoption of a nominal anchor (such as the nominal exchange rate), all of which ensure credibility of the public authorities.

40|$|The U. S. Great Inflation of the 1970 s was {{characterized}} by repeated, failed attempts at disinflation by the Federal Reserve as well as periods of inaction despite rising inflation. Previous research has attributed these failures to policymakers’ “misperceptions” about monetary policy and the macroeconomy. This paper argues instead that the Fed’s behavior during this period can be explained {{as a response to}} political constraints. Members of the Fed understood that a serious attempt to tackle inflation would be unpopular with the public and would generate opposition from Congress and the Executive branch. The result was a commitment to the policy of gradualism, under which the Fed would attempt to reduce inflation with mild policies that would not trigger an outright recession, and premature abandonment of <b>anti-inflation</b> <b>policies</b> {{at the first sign of}} recession. The Fed managed to disinflate successfully under Chairman Volcker only when the political constraints on Fed policy were lifted after 1979, allowing the Fed to abandon the policy of gradualism and knowingly take actions that risked recession. Evidence for this explanation of Fed behavior is found in Minutes and Transcripts of FOMC meetings and speeches of Fed chairmen. ...|$|R

Recent theories of rational voting behavior—Buchanan and Tullock 1 or Riker and Ordeshook 2 are examples—treat votes and voting as the outcome of a rational calculation of marginal costs and benefits. Prosperity, rising real income and increased employment may, in this framework, yield benefits to the individual that can be translated into votes for the party or candidate.

These policies work gradually and are replaced by policies to stimulate the economy, so the candidate or party can boast of prosperity and lower inflation at the next election. The conjecture arises also from casual and impressionistic evidence and from some studies of voting. Perhaps the most widely cited recent example is the Kennedy-Nixon election of 1960 when a small plurality and rising unemployment seemed to support the conjecture...|$|R
40|$|Inflation {{is one of}} main {{problems}} {{appearing in}} contemporary highly developed capitalist economies. Due to low efficiency of implemented <b>anti-inflation</b> <b>policies,</b> the research into the causes, effects and means of fighting inflation is still being carried out. Yet Western studies in that field possess the character of fragmentary explanations and do not grasp {{the very essence of}} the process of the rise in prices. The article is an attempt to look anew, by means of the structural method, at the origin of inflation. The inflation processes in contemporary highly developed capitalist economies are the product of long-term, internal mechanisms functioning in capitalist structure. Socio-economic conditions of economic activity within that structure form the basis for certain disproportions, the sign of which is, inter alia, the inflation. (The structural changes indicated in the article confirm that the rise in prices coincides to a high degree with the transformations in the sector and branch structures of capitalist economies and with the differences in the dynamics of growth of labour efficiency and wages related to those transformations. Inflation processes are also correlated with interventionist policies of contemporary capitalist states.

Previously, Olszewski had placed deep criticism on Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz from the previous two administrations and his controversial Balcerowicz plan, vigorously opposing the minister's shock therapy program. Removing Balcerowicz from the cabinet, Olszewski selected Karol Lutowski, a known critic of shock therapy, as his replacement. [...] With unemployment rising to 11.4 percent and the nation's gross domestic product declining by ten percent {{over the course of}} one year, the Olszewski government faced pressure to amend the unpopular economic plan.

Included in his industrial interventionist policy, the premier also proposed the unification of the nation's economic ministries to coordinate ongoing privatizations, as well as for all industrial and trade policies. When put to a vote, however, the deeply fragmented Sejm rejected Olszewski's reform packages, due to objections that the proposals were overly domineering or were too weak. Over the course of his government, the Sejm proved to be a barrier to any strong reforms.|$|R

The economy studied is one in which the authorities allow free mobility of capital under a crawling-peg exchange-rate regime.

Such a validation implies that higher inflation in China is unfavourable as it causes higher price instability that will reduce the efficiency of price system in allocating resource, hinder economic growth and could even result in economic disorder. This also suggests that a consistent and stable <b>anti-inflation</b> <b>policy</b> that reduces price instability would be preferable in China. ...|$|E
