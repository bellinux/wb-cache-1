50|$|A {{graduated}} payment mortgage loan, {{often referred}} to as GPM, is a mortgage with low initial monthly payments which gradually increase over a specified time frame. These plans are mostly geared towards young people who cannot afford large payments now, but can realistically expect to raise their incomes in the future. For instance a medical student who is just about to finish medical school might not have the financial capability to pay for a mortgage loan, but once he graduates, it is more than probable that he will be earning a high income. It is a form of negative <b>amortization</b> <b>loan.</b>|$|E

New Century reacted to this shock by massively resorting to deferred <b>amortization</b> <b>loan</b> contracts (“interest-only ” loans). We show that these loans were not only riskier, but also that their returns were by design more sensitive to real estate prices than standard con-tracts. New Century was thus financing projects with a high beta on its own survival, as predicted by a standard model of portfolio selection in financial distress.

40|$|Views {{expressed}} do {{not necessarily}} reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System. The current housing crisis has been long and severe. Some areas of the country—particularly California,Florida, and Arizona—have been hit much harder than other areas, such as the Midwest. A less-discussed issue is that home price tiers—high-priced, mid-priced, and lower-priced homes—each responded differently to the mortgage boom and subsequent implosion. Many factors caused the run-up in home prices. Interest rates were at unprecedented lows. Mortgage market innovations, including products such as interest-only <b>loans</b> and negative <b>amortization</b> <b>loans,</b> attracted many additional borrowers. Many first-time buyers rushed to buy a home, hoping to “get in ” before it was too late and homes became even more unaffordable. Also, the ability to finance all, or nearly all, of the purchase price artificially buoyed home prices, as individuals could “afford” more because a lower down payment was required...|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{most other}} adjustable-rate loans, many negative-amortization loans have been advertised with either teaser or artificial, {{introductory}} interest rates {{or with the}} minimum loan payment expressed {{as a percentage of}} the loan amount. For example, a negative-amortization loan is often advertised as featuring [...] "1% interest", or by prominently displaying a 1% number without explaining the F.I.R. This practice has been done by large corporate lenders. This practice has been considered deceptive for two different reasons: most mortgages do not feature teaser rates, so consumers do not look out for them; and, many consumers aren't aware of the negative amortization side effect of only paying 1% of the loan amount per year. In addition, most negative <b>amortization</b> <b>loans</b> contain a clause saying that the payment may not increase more than 7.5% each year, except if the 5-year period is over or if the balance has grown by 15%. Critics say this clause is only there to deceive borrowers into thinking the payment could only jump a small amount, whereas in fact the other two conditions are more likely to occur.|$|R

50|$|The {{estimates}} of Wallison, Calomiris, and Pinto {{are based upon}} analysis of the specific characteristics of the loans. For example, Wallison and Calomiris used 5 factors which, they believe, indicate subprime lending.

5000|$|This {{resulted}} {{in millions of}} people to be unqualified to refinance out of their risky subprime, adjustable rate and negative <b>amortization</b> <b>loans.</b> Many people suffered dramatic payment increases. At the same time, housing prices plummeted due to the [...] "housing correction" [...] That was fueled by record foreclosures. Based on RealtyTrac data, since December 2007 and through June 2010 {{there have been a}} total of 2.36 million U.S. properties repossessed by lenders through foreclosure (REO). In addition there have been 3.48 million default notices and 3.46 million scheduled foreclosure auctions. This major increase of properties on the market decreased home values creating a market with fewer qualified borrowers than homes for sale. When there is less demand the prices drop. Home values were at highly inflated levels prior to this due to historically low interest rates and the steady decline of credit requirements for the homeowner to qualify for a mortgage. Many homeowners found themselves with negative equity meaning the mortgage balance was considerably higher than the market value of the home also known as being [...] "underwater". Many homeowners elected to default voluntarily on their mortgage. Being [...] "underwater" [...] means their home is no longer an asset to them. With all this stacked against them and very few options, the result for many was default and foreclosure or loss mitigation.|$|R

5000|$|From 1934 through 1985, {{the finance}} {{industry}} averaged 13.8% of U.S. domestic corporate profit. Between 1986 and 1999, it averaged 23.5%. From 2000 through 2010, it averaged 32.6%. Some of this increase is doubtless {{due to increased}} efficiency from banking consolidation and innovations in new financial products that benefit consumers. However, if most consumers had refused to accept financial products they did not understand, e.g., negative <b>amortization</b> <b>loans,</b> the finance industry {{would not have been}} as profitable as it has been, and the Late-2000s recession might have been avoided or postponed. Stiglitz argued that the Late-2000s recession was created in part because, [...] "Bankers acted greedily because they had incentives and opportunities to do so". They did this in part by innovating to make consumer financial products like retail banking services and home mortgages as complicated as possible to make it easy for them to charge higher fees. Consumers who shop carefully for financial services typically find better options than the primary offerings of the major banks. However, few consumers think to do that. This explains part of this increase in financial industry profits.

5000|$|Due to the {{unconventional}} requirements of many super jumbo mortgage applicants, {{the popularity of}} unconventional mortgage programs amongst the wealthy is understandable. The popularity in particular of cash flow option ARM loans with super jumbo mortgage applicants is {{due in large part}} to the difference in perception of negative amortization in the context of their primary residence not being an asset but a liability. When home equity is substantial as required by the more stringent LTV requirements of super jumbo mortgage underwriting, negative amortization allows a borrower to extract more of the cash locked in the home's equity than would otherwise be possible, short of selling the property, due to the ability to defer interest above and beyond the Loan To Value stipulated on the note. In a conventional mortgage with principal and interest or interest only amortization, the borrower would be required to take out a second mortgage or line of credit to accomplish the same goal, but CLTV guidelines from most super jumbo lenders preclude the use of most of these products for this purpose. This is not to say that second mortgages and lines of credit are uncommon in super jumbo lending, in fact quite the opposite is true, but [...] "piggyback" [...] or [...] "80/20" [...] transactions which are common in conforming and jumbo loan financing are not as prevalent. Another popular application for the use of negative <b>amortization</b> <b>loans</b> by super jumbo mortgage borrowers is to shift as much of their taxable income to long term capital gains as possible by taking advantage of the lower monthly carrying costs and the ability to make lump sum payments at annual or semi-annual intervals. Super Jumbo Option ARM mortgages are also available in hybrid form, with fixed rate and fixed payment periods of 3, 5, 7 or 10 years, although they are relatively new on the super jumbo mortgage scene and not necessarily available to 8-figure loan amounts ($10 Million and up).|$|R
