[...] The protagonist of the novel is a hermaphrodite named Marion who lives a double life, frequenting literary salons in female dress, then changing from skirt to trousers to attend gay soirées. Barney is Laurette Wells, a salon hostess who spends much of the novel trying to win back an ex-lover loosely based on Renée Vivien. The book's portrayal of her is, at times, harshly critical, but she is the only person whose company Marion enjoys. [...] Marion tells Wells that she is [...] "perverse... dissolute, self-centered, unfair, stubborn, sometimes miserly... a genuine rebel, ever ready to incite others to rebellion.... ou are capable of loving someone just as they are, even a thief—in that lies your only fidelity. [...] <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> my respect." ...|$|E

"When I got it, I {{was pretty}} shocked – I must say it's not {{something}} I'd ever expected – <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{to sit down}} and wonder what the hell you're going to do. But as I've been getting into it in the last few months, then you realise that it's just not the case that you spend lots of money – about one in four of the government dollars – but the issues are just so wide ranging. Yesterday, I was in Alice Springs, talking to people about the difficulties that they're having with Aboriginal alcoholism and violence – the kind of problems that it's bringing – and then you're back into discussions on – race back to Cabinet for discussions on migration and what kind of social security benefits people might get, and then you're talking about age pensions, this morning, on another program about some people's concerns. It's just so big. I'll get interested, don't worry." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mega Man 9 was co-{{developed}} by Capcom and Inti Creates. The latter {{company had}} developed the Mega Man Zero and Mega Man ZX spin-off series and employs many former Capcom members {{who worked on}} previous Mega Man games. The first six games in the original Mega Man series were created for the NES during the late 1980s and early 1990s. A plethora of spin-off series, related games, and compilations were published by Capcom {{as a result of}} the original series' immense popularity. The most recent entries in the main series, Mega Man 8 and Mega Man & Bass, were first released on more advanced home consoles in 1996 and 1998 respectively. Keiji Inafune, a designer, artist, and producer at Capcom, has been involved in most of franchise's development. As early as 2004, Inafune, credited as [...] "Inafking", publicly expressed his desire to make a Mega Man 9 as a [...] "throwback to the super [...] ", but that its creation would highly depend on the input of fans. According to Inafune, the simple fun of a classic Mega Man game [...] "doesn't fit into the grandiose and expansive world that the consumer gaming industry has become, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to make games that match the current expectations". He also believed that pushing for the creation of a Mega Man in the style of the original [...] "would be quickly criticized for things like being simplistic, outdated, or too expensive", thus making it too difficult to develop such games in the current climate.|$|E

You killed a man, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{sentence}} for life. They can't give more than that, and if they were to give less there would be more murders than there are, for every one would think that they could kill at least one person without being punished very heavily for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} is because {{it is easier to}} cut away at the edges, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> they get more off there. Now <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better get your wedge as true, and perfect, and smooth as you can, before you saw it off. It will be a great deal pleasanter to work with a good wedge than with a poor one, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better take pains with it, and make as perfect a one as you can, if you make any." ...|$|R
30|$|One thing I have {{realized}} personally {{for a while}} is that I always loved, may be because I {{grew up in a}} multilingual society where you always knew there are other languages all around <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> to way of opening up of other things. I have a feeling that we, it is easier for us to translate and become something else and understand. But Americans tend to be so unique, language, so just like one language and sound one way.|$|R

"On {{one side}} of a table stands a grave-looking elderly gentleman with the ballot-box before him; on the other side sits a second still more grave, with an open book; in the book is written, each several number, on the margin, and {{opposite}} the number the name of the juror thereby denoted. The first grave gentleman shakes the box, puts in his hand, and takes out a card, from which he reads the number—then the other grave gentleman turns to that number in the book, and pronounces the name of the juror so numbered, whose name and address are then taken down as one of the forty-eight; and this process is repeated forty-eight times... it is said—I say nothing, but it is said—that those two gentlemen know each juror just as well by his number as by his name: and so, when the first takes out a card and finds 253, for example, written on it—if he knows that 253 would vote for the people, and against the Crown, it is said he gives out (as solemn as he looks), not 253, but, say, 255, or some loyal number; and thus a safe man is put on the list. Or, if anyone is standing by, and has an opportunity of seeing the card, he cries 253, and winks, or otherwise telegraphs to this other grave gentleman. Then the onus is upon the man with the book, who has nothing to do but call out a loyal man for the disloyal number, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> safe voters still. They never make the mistake, these elderly gentlemen, of turning out the whole forty-eight all of the right sort there is no need: there is a margin to the extent of twelve: and so they generally leave about nine or ten dubious names amongst the forty-eight. The Crown has afterwards the right to strike off twelve peremptorily, without reason assigned, and always gets rid of the men who would vote for the people.|$|E

6000|$|... 'No. It's {{because you}} are like no one else. <b>You</b> are <b>so</b> good, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> sweet-tempered. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> such a gentle nature, and you are always right.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "The swag--plunder--pieces. It's {{a game of}} grab. We {{must have}} it; but it isn't easy, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>you</b> will <b>have</b> to lend a hand. Come! is it kept in the house?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{the best}} of me. But you can't make me like a lord, or think that a young man ought to wear a silk gown." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>have,</b> friend. Some {{days ago}} the Pearl-Maiden {{departed}} to Tyre {{in charge of}} the captain, Gallus, on her way to Rome. Perhaps you would wish to follow and sell her your onions there." ...|$|E

6000|$|But if {{you want}} the best idea of Cape Horn, get my friend Dana's unmatchable [...] "Two Years Before the Mast." [...] But <b>you</b> can read, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>you</b> must <b>have</b> read it. His {{chapters}} describing Cape Horn must have been written with an icicle.|$|R
6000|$|My Uncle Grafton {{raised his}} hand to protest, but Mr. Carvel continued: [...] "I know you, Grafton, I know you. When a lad it was your habit to lay aside the money I gave <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> pretend <b>you</b> <b>had</b> none." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It is {{the first}} stage. Then you {{encourage}} it, and there comes the trance.

You leave your machine to be worked by another. Hein? But what have unicorns to do with it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How characteristic!" [...] murmured the lawyer, {{reviewing}} {{matters in}} his mind. [...] "I always understood from books that your countrymen {{were in a}} hurry. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> gone forty miles to town and back--before dinner--to get a scarab?

6000|$|... "It does. Your dear {{father died}} a bankrupt.

6000|$|... "Oh! I've {{very little}} to be proud of, really," [...] said Dick, blushing; [...] "anyone could do as much with my fairy things, of which, no doubt, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> heard.

6000|$|... "God grant he {{may come}} safe out of it!" [...] said John. [...] "I'll tell you what, Sydney, though, it is a shame, when I am the gainer: I think your romance went astray; more faith and {{patience}} would have {{waited to see}} the real hero come out, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> missed him and got the ordinary, jog-trot, commonplace fellow instead." ...|$|E

[...] "I am a new-comer here, as you say, and they call it {{eighteen}} years since you left the foot of Graylock.
