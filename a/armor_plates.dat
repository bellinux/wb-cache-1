5|$|Although {{she had not}} {{suffered}} {{anything like}} the damage she had inflicted, Virginia was not completely unscathed. Shots from Cumberland, Congress, and Union troops ashore had riddled her smokestack, reducing her already low speed. Two of her guns were disabled and several <b>armor</b> <b>plates</b> had been loosened. Two of her crew were killed, and more were wounded. One of the wounded was Captain Buchanan, whose left thigh was pierced by a rifle shot.|$|E
5|$|Orthrozanclus reburrus ("Dawn scythe with bristling hair") was {{discovered}} in 2006 and formally described in 2007. This animal had a soft, unarmored underside, but the upward-facing surfaces were armored by: a small shell, near the front end; three zones of <b>armor</b> <b>plates,</b> which fitted close to the body and one of which ran all the way round the animal; 16 to 20 long, upwards-curving spines {{on each side of}} the body. The arrangement of Orthrozanclus′ <b>armor</b> <b>plates</b> is very similar to that of its Burgess Shale contemporary Wiwaxia. Its shell is very similar to one of the two Burgess Shale shell types labelled Oikozetetes; the forward shell of halkieriids, most fossils of which are dated to the Early Cambrian; and those of other Early Cambrian fossils such as Ocruranus and Eohalobia. These similarities suggest that Orthrozanclus was an intermediate form between Wiwaxia and the Halkieriids and that all three of these taxa formed a clade, in other words a group that consists of a common ancestor and all of its descendants. So Orthrozanclus was also drawn into the complex debate about whether Wiwaxia is more closely related to molluscs or to polychaete worms.|$|E

She was refitted from August to December and had her forward hull <b>armor</b> <b>plates</b> replaced by a one-piece cast iron ram. Still in reserve in 1869, Rochambeau was modified with an additional 240 mm pivot gun mounted over the forward end of the casemate and the pine planking underneath the guns in the casemate was replaced by oak.|$|E
5|$|The {{fuselage}} of {{the aircraft}} is built around the cannon. The GAU-8/A is mounted slightly to the port side; the barrel in the firing location is on the starboard side at the 9 o'clock position so it is aligned with the aircraft's centerline. The gun's 5-foot, 11.5-inch (1.816 m) ammunition drum can hold up to 1,350 rounds of 30mm ammunition, but generally holds 1,174 rounds. To protect the GAU-8/A rounds from enemy fire, <b>armor</b> <b>plates</b> of differing thicknesses between the aircraft skin and the drum are designed to detonate incoming shells.|$|E
5|$|After Indiana {{returned}} to active duty, she {{participated in the}} invasion of Hollandia in western New Guinea. The ship then {{returned to}} the central Pacific and bombarded Truk, and subsequently took part in operations off the Marianas Islands. On 19 June 1944 a Japanese torpedo bomber attempted to attack the ship, but Indianas anti-aircraft gunners managed to destroy both the aircraft and the torpedo it had dropped, with no damage to the ship. Shortly thereafter, a second Japanese plane was shot down, but a third managed to crash into the ship. The aircraft disintegrated upon striking the side <b>armor</b> <b>plates</b> and scattered pieces of the plane across the stern. Five men were injured, but the ship suffered only very slight damage.|$|E

5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the lengthy building times of these ships, other countries were able to build dreadnoughts that were superior in protection and armament, {{with the exception of}} the French. Construction was delayed by late deliveries of the 305-millimeter guns and <b>armor</b> <b>plates</b> as well as shortages of labor. The Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912 diverted workers at the shipyards for repairs and maintenance of the ships participating in the war. The Italians imported the raw nickel steel for their armor from America and Britain and processed it into their equivalent of Krupp cemented armor, called Terni cemented, but there were problems with this process and suitable plates took longer to produce than planned.|$|E

5|$|An ironclad is a steam-propelled warship {{protected}} by iron or steel <b>armor</b> <b>plates</b> {{used in the}} early part of the second half of the 19th century. The ironclad was developed as a result of the vulnerability of wooden warships to explosive or incendiary shells. The first ironclad battleship, , was launched by the French Navy in November 1859. The British Admiralty had been considering armored warships since 1856 and prepared a draft design for an armored corvette in 1857; in early 1859 the Royal Navy started building two iron-hulled armored frigates, and by 1861 had made the decision to move to an all-armored battle fleet. After the first clashes of ironclads (both with wooden ships and with one another) took place in 1862 during the American Civil War, it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the unarmored ship of the line as the most powerful warship afloat. This type of ship would come to be very successful in the American Civil War.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the ships}} was {{authorized}} on 30 June 1890 and the contract for Indiana—not including guns and armor—was awarded to William Cramp & Sons in Philadelphia, who offered to build it for $3,020,000. The {{total cost of the}} ship was almost twice as high, approximately $6,000,000. The contract specified the ship had to be built in three years, but slow delivery of <b>armor</b> <b>plates</b> caused a two-year delay. Indianas keel was laid down on 7 May 1891 and she was launched on 28 February 1893, attended by around 10,000 people, including President Benjamin Harrison, several members of his cabinet and the two senators from Indiana. During her fitting-out in early March 1894, the ship undertook a preliminary sea trial to test her speed and machinery. At this point her side armor, guns, turrets and conning tower had not yet been fitted, and her official trials would not take place until October 1895 due to the delays in armor deliveries.|$|E

The {{total cost of the}} ship was almost twice as high, approximately $6,000,000. The contract specified the ship had to be built in three years, but slow delivery of <b>armor</b> <b>plates</b> and guns caused a delay. Her keel was laid down on 25 June 1891 and she was launched two years later on 10 June 1893. The launching ceremony was attended by thousands of people, including Secretary of the Navy Hilary A. Herbert and commander George Dewey. Her preliminary sea trial did not take place until March 1896 because of the delays in armor and gun deliveries. At this point Massachusetts was almost complete, and her official trial was held a month later.|$|E
5|$|Like other ankylosaurids, Ankylosaurus had {{cervical}} half-rings (<b>armor</b> <b>plates</b> on the neck), {{but these}} are only known from fragments, making their exact arrangement uncertain. Carpenter suggested that when seen from above, the plates would have been paired, and created an inverted V-shape across the neck, with the midline gap probably being filled with small ossicles (round bony scutes) to allow for movement. He believed the width of this armor belt was too wide to have fitted solely on the neck, and that it covered {{the base of the}} neck and continued onto the shoulder region. Paleontologists Victoria M. Arbour and Philip J. Currie disagreed with Carpenter's interpretation, and pointed out that the cervical half-ring fragments of specimen AMNH 5895 did not fit together in the way proposed by Carpenter (though this could be due to breakage). They instead suggested that the fragments represented the remains of two cervical half-rings, which formed two semi-circular plates of armor around {{the upper part of the}} neck, as in the closely related Anodontosaurus and Euoplocephalus.|$|E

5|$|Navarin, {{named after}} the Battle of Navarino, was ordered on 24 April 1889 from the Franco-Russian Works and {{construction}} began on 13 July 1889 at their Saint Petersburg shipyard. The ship was laid down on 31 May 1890 and launched on 20 October 1891. She was transferred to Kronstadt in 1893 for fitting out, but did not enter service until June 1896 {{at a cost of}} over nine million rubles. Construction was seriously delayed by problems with the boilers and late deliveries of <b>armor</b> <b>plates,</b> the gun mountings, and other components, compounded by inefficiencies in building. One example of such was that the Russian armor plate company lacked the capacity to make gun port armor for the gun turrets of the required thickness, but the builder somehow lost track of this fact and had to place a rush order with the French company of St. Chamond.|$|E
5|$|The {{skeletal}} reconstruction {{accompanying the}} 1908 description restored the missing parts {{in a fashion}} similar to Stegosaurus, and Brown likened the result to the extinct armored mammal Glyptodon. Contrary to modern depictions, Brown's stegosaur-like reconstruction showed robust forelimbs, a strongly arched back, a pelvis with prongs projecting forwards from the ilium and pubis, {{as well as a}} short, drooping tail without a tail club, which was unknown at the time. Brown also reconstructed the <b>armor</b> <b>plates</b> in parallel rows running down the back; this arrangement was purely hypothetical. Brown's reconstruction became highly influential, and restorations of the animal based on his diagram were published as late as the 1980s. In a 1908 review of Brown's Ankylosaurus description, American paleontologist Samuel Wendell Williston criticised the skeletal reconstruction as being based on too scanty remains, and claimed that Ankylosaurus was merely a synonym of the genus Stegopelta, which Williston had named in 1905. Williston also stated that a skeletal reconstruction of the related Polacanthus by Hungarian paleontologist Franz Nopcsa was a better example of how ankylosaurs would have appeared in life. The claim of synonymy was not accepted by other researchers, and the two genera are now considered distinct.|$|E

25|$|The alveolates {{are a major}} clade of {{unicellular}} eukaryotes of both autotrophic and heterotrophic members. The {{most notable}} shared characteristic {{is the presence of}} cortical (outer-region) alveoli (sacs). These are flattened vesicles (sacs) packed into a continuous layer just under the membrane and supporting it, typically forming a flexible pellicle (thin skin). In dinoflagellates they often form <b>armor</b> <b>plates.</b> Many members contain a red-algal derived plastid. One notable characteristic of this diverse group is the frequent loss of photosynthesis. However, a majority of these heterotrophs continue to process a non-photosynthetic plastid.|$|E
