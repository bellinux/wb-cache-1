40|$|The Chinese Anti-monopoly Law (AML) {{entered into}} force on August 1, 2008 {{and abuse of}} <b>administrative</b> <b>power</b> to {{eliminate}} or restrict competition is prohibited and dealt in Chapter Five of this law. Abuse of <b>administrative</b> <b>power</b> {{is one of the}} most significant ways to eliminate or restrict competition in China. Great concerns had been focused on the rules of abuse of <b>administrative</b> <b>power</b> before the AML was promulgated. However, its progress in practice is slow and experiences difficulties after this law took effect. Little research has been undertaken outside of China on abuse of <b>administrative</b> <b>power</b> to eliminate or restrict competition due to the specific background and situation pertaining in China. Concerning to abuse of <b>administrative</b> <b>power,</b> the AML have close relationships with EU competition law and free movement rules. This thesis aims to provide a critical comparison between the AML, Article 106 TFEU of EU competition law and free movement rules, and draws on the EU’s experience as a source of criticism and guidance in relation to the application of abuse of <b>administrative</b> <b>power</b> to eliminate or restrict competition in the AML. This study first provides a background introduction on the development of the AML and abuse of <b>administrative</b> <b>power</b> to eliminate or restrict competition and analyses the complicated causes of abuse of <b>administrative</b> <b>power</b> in competition through three areas: the history of China’s economic system, economic theory and legislation. The main comparative and critical research are held in Chapters Four and Five which examine the relationships between abuse of <b>administrative</b> <b>power</b> in the AML, Article 106 TFEU and EU free movement rules respectively. In Chapter Six a case study is taken in telecommunications sector. The application of abuse of <b>administrative</b> <b>power</b> provisions of the AML in telecommunications sector is examined through three areas: market access, interconnection and universal services. This thesis concludes by noting that (1) abuse of <b>administrative</b> <b>power</b> to eliminate or restrict competition provisions in the AML should be revised on the content of these provisions and their exemption rules; (2) a dual-structure of controlling abuse of <b>administrative</b> <b>power</b> based on monopolistic conduct and free circulation is held in the AML; (3) the inapplicability of abuse of <b>administrative</b> <b>power</b> provisions in these telecommunications issues requires a revise for abuse of <b>administrative</b> <b>power</b> in the AML. ...|$|R

5|$|Alboin's {{decision}} {{to create a}} duchy and designate a duke were both important innovations; until then, the Lombards had never had dukes or duchies based on a walled town. The innovation adopted was part of Alboin's borrowing of Roman and Ostrogothic administrative models, as in Late Antiquity the comes civitatis (city count) was the main local authority, with full <b>administrative</b> <b>powers</b> in his region. But the shift from count (comes) to duke (dux) and from county (comitatus) to duchy (ducatus) also signalled the progressive militarization of Italy. The selection of a fortified town as the centre for the new duchy was also an important change from the time in Pannonia, for while urbanized settlements had previously been ignored by the Lombards, now a considerable part of the nobility settled itself in Forum Iulii, a pattern that was repeated regularly by the Lombards in their other duchies.|$|E

5|$|Patel and Menon {{backed up}} their {{diplomatic}} efforts by producing treaties {{that were designed}} to be attractive to rulers of princely states. Two key documents were produced. The first was the Standstill Agreement, which confirmed the continuance of the pre-existing agreements and administrative practices. The second was the Instrument of Accession, by which the ruler of the princely state in question agreed to the accession of his kingdom to independent India, granting the latter control over specified subject matters. The nature of the subject matters varied depending on the acceding state. The states which had internal autonomy under the British signed an Instrument of Accession which only ceded three subjects {{to the government of}} India—defence, external affairs, and communications, each defined in accordance with List 1 to Schedule VII of the Government of India Act 1935. Rulers of states which were in effect estates or talukas, where substantial <b>administrative</b> <b>powers</b> were exercised by the Crown, signed a different Instrument of Accession, which vested all residuary powers and jurisdiction in the Government of India. Rulers of states which had an intermediate status signed a third type of Instrument, which preserved the degree of power they had under the British.|$|E
