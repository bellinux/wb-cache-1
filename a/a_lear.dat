2500|$|McGuinn also penned the album's closing track, [...] "2-4-2 Fox Trot (The Lear Jet Song)", {{which was}} an attempt to create an aural {{approximation}} of a flight in <b>a</b> <b>Lear</b> Jet. The song was inspired by the band's friendship with jet manufacturer John Lear and the title is a reference to the registration number of Lear's own personal jet, which was N242FT. The song makes extensive use of aviation sound effects, including an in-cockpit recitation of a pilot's pre-takeoff checklist and the sound of a jet engine starting up. While the song can be regarded as another of The Byrds' quirky album closers, like [...] "Oh! Susannah" [...] and [...] "We'll Meet Again" [...] from their previous albums, Crosby and McGuinn actually took the song very seriously, arguing that it was an innovative attempt at incorporating mechanical sounds into a pop song format.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to suggest the ideal way of <b>a</b> <b>learing</b> group {{required}} in recent adult education, by the method of inquiring of the quality of human relationship in the learning group. Until recently, studies in adult education have tended to place their interests on the process to get scientific knowledge. On the other hand, the network theory has been already appeared in the field of adult education in recent years. The theory tends to consider important the quality of human relationship supporting 'self-reliance of individual', and it shares many parts of my opinion. Historically speaking, the study point in learning theory has been moved from the primitive group theory to the discussion in which stress is laid on the cognition of individual and, moreover, the network theory which integrates the both is, as a new model, being on research. Based on the above point-of-view, this paper tries to present the 'face-to-face network' as a required aspect of <b>a</b> <b>learing</b> group in recent adult education, by analysis and comparison of the theories by Kosaku MIYASAKA, Ikuyo KANEKO, and Kohei HANASAKI...|$|R

2500|$|Lear contributed vocals for a {{cover of}} Giorgio Moroder's 1970s hit [...] "From Here to Eternity", {{recorded}} in 2000 with Eric D. Clark. The song was a minor club success in the USA. In December 2000 Lear's husband, Alain-Philippe, died in an explosive accidental fire at their house in the South of France, which was left in ruins. 20-year-old cat breeder Didier Dieufis was also killed in the fire, {{and a number of}} Dalí's works were lost. In 2001 Lear threw herself back into work and put on an art exhibition in 2001 entitled Not <b>a.</b> <b>Lear,</b> followed by a new album Heart, dedicated to the late husband. The album offered club-friendly tracks like [...] "I Just Wanna Dance Again" [...] and {{a cover of}} [...] "Love Boat", the title song from a cult 1970s TV series of the same name, both issued as singles and featuring remixes by some prominent names in the world of French dance music such as Laurent Wolf and Junior Vasquez.

60|$|The Troilus and Cressida of Shakespeare can {{scarcely}} be classed with his dramas of Greek and Roman history; but it forms an intermediate {{link between the}} fictitious Greek and Roman histories, which we may call legendary dramas, and the proper ancient histories,—that is, between the Pericles or Titus Andronicus, and the Coriolanus or Julius Cæsar. Cymbeline is a congener with Pericles, and distinguished from Lear by not having any declared prominent object. But where shall we class the Timon of Athens? Perhaps immediately below Lear. It is <b>a</b> <b>Lear</b> of the satirical drama; <b>a</b> <b>Lear</b> of domestic or ordinary life;—a local eddy of passion on the high road of society, while all around is the week-day goings on of wind and weather; <b>a</b> <b>Lear,</b> therefore, without its soul-searching flashes, its ear-cleaving thunder-claps, its meteoric splendours,—without the contagion and the fearful sympathies of nature, the fates, the furies, the frenzied elements, dancing in and out, now breaking through and scattering,—now hand in hand with,—the fierce or fantastic group of human passions, crimes, and anguishes, reeling on the unsteady ground, in a wild harmony to the shock and the swell of an earthquake. But my present subject was Troilus and Cressida; and I suppose that, scarcely knowing what to say of it, I by a cunning of instinct ran off to subjects on which I should find it difficult not to say too much, though certain after all that I should still leave the better part unsaid, and the gleaning for others richer than my own harvest.|$|E

60|$|For {{what is the}} use to {{the stage}} of that {{archaeology}} which has so strangely terrified the critics, but that it, and it alone, can give us the architecture and apparel suitable to the time in which {{the action of the}} play passes? It enables us to see a Greek dressed like a Greek, and an Italian like an Italian; to enjoy the arcades of Venice and the balconies of Verona; and, if the play deals with any of the great eras in our country's history, to contemplate the age in its proper attire, and the king in his habit as he lived. And I wonder, by the way, what Lord Lytton would have said some time ago, at the Princess's Theatre, had the curtain risen on his father's Brutus reclining in a Queen Anne chair, attired in a flowing wig and a flowered dressing-gown, a costume which in the last century was considered peculiarly appropriate to an antique Roman! For in those halcyon days of the drama no archaeology troubled the stage, or distressed the critics, and our inartistic grandfathers sat peaceably in a stifling atmosphere of anachronisms, and beheld with the calm complacency of the age of prose an Iachimo in powder and patches, <b>a</b> <b>Lear</b> in lace ruffles, and a Lady Macbeth in a large crinoline. I can understand archaeology being attacked on the ground of its excessive realism, but to attack it as pedantic seems to be very much beside the mark. However, to attack it for any reason is foolish; one might just as well speak disrespectfully of the equator. For archaeology, being a science, is neither good nor bad, but a fact simply. Its value depends entirely on how it is used, and only an artist can use it. We look to the archaeologist for the materials, to the artist for the method.|$|E

6000|$|No {{sooner had}} this great man passed away, and an earnest age with him, and Charles mounted the throne, {{than from the}} darkest {{recesses}} of the stews and the taverns, from the depths within depths of Alsatia or Paris, the whole tribe of dancers, fiddlers, drabs, mimes, stage-players, and playwrights, knowing that their enemy was dead, and their hour of harvest had come, emerged in swarming multitudes--multitudes swelled by the vast tribe of play-goers, who had been counting the hours since a Falstaff had made them laugh, an Ophelia made them weep, and <b>a</b> <b>Lear</b> made them tremble. And had this only issued in {{the revival of the}} drama of Shakspeare and Johnson, few could have had much to say in objection; for that, in general, was as pure as it was powerful. But, alas, besides them there had been a Beaumont, a Fletcher, and a Massinger, with their unutterable abominations. Nay, the king and courtiers had imported from France a taste which required for its gratification a licentiousness still more abandoned, and to be cast, besides, into forms and shapes, as stiff, stately, and elaborate as the material was vile, and were not contented with pollution unless served up in a new, piquant, and unnatural manner. Our poet understood this movement of his time right well, and determined to conform to it. He knew that he could, better than any man living, pander to the popular appetite for the melodramatic, for the grandiloquent, and for the obscene. He knew the taste of Charles, and that he, above all cooks, could dress up a ragout of that putrid perfection which his king relished. And he set himself with his whole might so to do, and for thirty years and more continued his degradation of genius--a degradation unexampled, whether we consider the powers of the writer, the coarseness, quantity, and elaboration of the pollutions he perpetrated, or the length of time in which he was employed, in thus [...] "profaning the God-given strength and marring the lofty line." ...|$|E
60|$|Divine {{service was}} concluded; the Doctor had preached a capital sermon; {{for he had}} been one of the shining lights of his {{university}} until his rich but isolating preferment had apparently closed the great career which it was once supposed awaited him. The accustomed walk on the terrace was completed, and dinner was announced. This meal was always celebrated at Cherbury, where new fashions stole down with a lingering pace, in the great hall itself. An ample table was placed in the centre on a mat of rushes, sheltered by a large screen covered with huge maps of the shire and the neighbouring counties. The Lady Annabel and her good pastor seated themselves at each end of the table, while Venetia, mounted on a high chair, was waited on by Mistress Pauncefort, who never condescended by any chance attention to notice the presence of any other individual but her little charge, on whose chair she just leaned with an air of condescending devotion. The butler stood behind his lady, and two other servants watched the Doctor; rural bodies all, but decked on this day in gorgeous livery coats of blue and silver, which had been made originally for men of very different size and bearing. Simple as was the usual diet at Cherbury the cook was permitted on Sunday full play to her art, which, in the eighteenth century, indulged in the production of dishes more numerous and substantial than our refined tastes could at present tolerate. The Doctor appreciated a good dinner, and his countenance glistened with approbation as he surveyed the ample tureen of potage royal, with a boned duck swimming in its centre. Before him still scowled in death the grim countenance of a huge roast pike, flanked on one side by a leg of mutton à-la-daube, and on the other by the tempting delicacies of bombarded veal. To these succeeded that masterpiece of the culinary art, a grand battalia pie, in which the bodies of chickens, pigeons, and rabbits were embalmed in spices, cocks' combs, and savoury balls, and well bedewed with one of those rich sauces of claret, anchovy, and sweet herbs, in which our great-grandfathers delighted, and which was technically termed <b>a</b> <b>Lear.</b> But the grand essay of skill was the cover of this pasty, whereon the curious cook had contrived to represent all the once-living forms that were now entombed in that gorgeous sepulchre. A Florentine tourte, or tansy, an old English custard, a more refined blamango, and a riband jelly of many colours, offered a pleasant relief after these vaster inventions, and the repast closed with a dish of oyster loaves and a pompetone of larks.|$|E
