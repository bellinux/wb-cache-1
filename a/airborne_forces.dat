5|$|Several modern {{historians have}} also praised the {{operation}} and the improvements that were made for Varsity. G. G. Norton argued that the operation benefited from the lessons learned from previous operations, and Brian Jewell agrees, arguing that the lessons of Market Garden had been learned as the <b>airborne</b> <b>forces</b> were concentrated and quickly dropped, giving the defenders little time to recover. Norton also argues that improvements were made for supporting the airborne troops; he notes {{that a large number}} of artillery pieces were available to cover the landings and that observers were dropped with the <b>airborne</b> <b>forces,</b> thus augmenting the firepower and flexibility of the airborne troops. He also highlights the development of a technique that allowed entire brigades to be landed in tactical groups, giving them greater flexibility. Dropping the <b>airborne</b> <b>forces</b> after the ground forces had breached the Rhine also ensured that the airborne troops would not have to fight for long before being relieved, a major improvement on the manner in which the previous large-scale airborne operation, Market Garden, had been conducted.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} {{thesis is}} {{an examination of}} the establishment and initial development of a British <b>airborne</b> <b>force.</b> Beginning with an examination of airborne development outside the UK up to 1940, it traces the growing British use of air transport as a tool for imperial policing in the inter-war period, and examines why this did not lead to the logical step of creating a dedicated British <b>airborne</b> <b>force.</b> The impact of German airborne operations and the defeat at Dunkirk in 1940 on British attitudes is then analysed, followed by a detailed examination of the mechanics of the establishment of a British <b>airborne</b> <b>force,</b> ending with the British 1 st Parachute Brigade attaining operational status in January 1942...|$|R

5|$|Following the {{appointment}} of General Bernard Montgomery to the command of the 21st Army Group and overall command of all ground forces to land in Normandy, the plan underwent a number of further revisions. On 21 January 1944, a revised Overlord plan was presented to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had been chosen as the Supreme Allied Commander for the invasion. Montgomery's revised plan widened the landing area to include all of the coastline between the River Orne and the eastern coast of the Cotentin Peninsula; five divisions would land on the beaches, and supported by three airborne divisions to land {{on either side of}} the landing areas to secure their flanks and protect the landing troops from counterattack. The British <b>airborne</b> <b>forces</b> were assigned to the eastern flank, and the American <b>airborne</b> <b>forces</b> the west.|$|E
5|$|Lack of an {{available}} <b>airborne</b> division <b>forced</b> the Allies {{to assemble}} {{an ad hoc}} formation, the 1st <b>Airborne</b> Task <b>Force,</b> in Italy on 1July1944.

5|$|On 15 May 1942 {{a special}} {{supplement}} to the London Gazette carried the announcement of 19 decorations; Frost was awarded the Military Cross (MC), Cook the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) and Cox the Military Medal (MM); there were two other DSCs, two Distinguished Service Medals (DSM), one other MC, two further MMs and nine Mentions in Despatches (MiD). Wing Commander Pickard was also subsequently awarded a bar to his Distinguished Service Order, on 26 May. The success of the raid also prompted the War Office to expand the existing British <b>airborne</b> <b>forces,</b> setting up the <b>Airborne</b> <b>Forces</b> Depot and Battle School in Derbyshire in April 1942, and creating the Parachute Regiment as well as converting a number of infantry battalions to airborne battalions in August 1942.|$|E

During the day his hopes would be dashed.|$|E

5|$|One final {{consequence}} of the raid was that the Telecommunications Research Establishment, {{where much of the}} Bruneval equipment was analysed, and British radar systems were designed and tested, was moved further inland from Swanage on the southern coast of England to Malvern to ensure that it was not the target of a reprisal raid by German <b>airborne</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|E
