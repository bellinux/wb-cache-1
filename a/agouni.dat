5000|$|Slimane Azem {{was born}} September 19, 1918 at <b>Agouni</b> Gueghrane, {{a small village}} located on the foothills of Djurdjura. Nothing predestined this son of a poor farmer to a musical career. A rather mediocre student, he had {{a passion for the}} La Fontaine's Fables that would later {{influence}} his writings and compositions. At the age of 11, he became a farm worker for a colonist in Staouéli, a small resort near Algiers (the very beach were the French army landed in 1830). In 1937, he landed at Longwy as part of the Service du travail obligatoire and found work in a steel mill operation before being mobilized during the [...] "Phoney War" [...] in Issoudun. In 1940, he was discharged and went to Paris where he was hired as an assistant electrician in the Paris Métro. In 1942, Slimane was in Paris. The capital fascinated him and yet the work was hard. He was accustomed to life in the village in the great outdoors, but was now confined in tunnels and underground eight hours a day in the metro. Two years later, he underwent deportation by German troops in the Rhineland and remained there until its liberation in 1945, by the Americans.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies showed}} the {{presence}} of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) and membrane-shed microparticles (MPs) in vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques. H&S Science and Biotechnology developed PTCTS, composed by natural particles from medicinal plants (PTC) combined with trans-Sialidase (TS), to combat MPs and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Our aim {{was to determine the}} effects of the different components of PTCTS in a rabbit model of atherosclerosis. Rabbits were fed with high cholesterol diet for 12 weeks and treated during the last 6 weeks with either vehicle, PTC, TS, or PTCTS. Lipid profile and quantification of MPs positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and oxidized LDL antigens were carried out. Aortas and organs were then histologically analyzed. PTCTS reduced circulating MPs positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and oxidized LDL antigens, reduced the plaque area in the abdominal aorta, and caused positive remodeling of the ascendant aorta. PTC caused positive remodeling and reduced plaque area in the abdominal aorta; however, TS had a lipid lowering effect. PTCTS components combined were more effective against atherosclerosis than individual components. Our data reinforce the infectious theory of atherosclerosis and underscore the potential role of circulating MPs. Therefore, the removal of Mycoplasma-derived MPs could be a new therapeutic approach in the treatment of atherosclerosis.

Among the candidate proteins harbored by MPs, we recently showed that morphogen Sonic hedgehog is present in MPs generated from activated/apoptotic human T lymphocytes and corrects endothelial injury through nitric oxide (NO) release (<b>Agouni</b> et al. FASEB J 2007). The present study further investigates whether MPs bearing Shh prevent angiotensin II (Ang II) -induced hypertension and endothelial dysfunction in mice. Male Swiss mice (6 – 8 week old) were subcutaneously implanted with osmotic minipumps delivering Ang II (0. 5 mg/kg per day) or NaCl (0. 9 %, control group). Systolic blood pressure and heart rate were measured daily during 21 consecutive days using tail cuff plethysmography connected to a computerized system (LE 5002 #, BIOSEB). Mice were tained for 7 days. After 7 day of minipump implantation, mice received i. v. injections of MPs (10 μg/mL) or i. p. Sonic Hedgehog receptor antagonist cyclopamine (10 mg/kg per 2 days) during 1 week prior sacrifice. Thoracic aorta was removed, cleaned of connective tissue and cut in rings (3 mm length) and mounted in a myograph to study vascular reactivity. Ang II induced a significant rise in systolic blood pressure without affecting heart rate when compared to control mice. Interestingly, MPs alone did not modify both parameters but reversed Ang II-induced hypertension. Moreover, cyclopamine prevented the effects of MPs on Ang II-induced hypertension, suggesting the involvement of a Sonic Hedgehog-dependent mechanism. In the aorta, MPs alone slightly increased the sensitivity of endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine and completely reversed the impairment of acetylcholine-induced relaxation in aorta from Ang II-infused mice. The improvement of endothelial function induced by MPs was completely prevented by cyclopamine treatment. Moreover, measurement of NO production showed that MPs alone did not modify NO production in aorta, but significantly restored its decrease in Ang II-treated mice. Altogether, these results show that MPs bearing Sonic hedgehog prevent Ang II-induced hypertension and endothelial dysfunction in aorta through a mechanism associated with Sonic hedgehog-induced NO production. These MPs may represent a new therapeutic approach in cardiovascular diseases associated with decreased NO production...|$|E
40|$|Most of {{diabetic}} cardiovascular complications {{are attributed}} to endothelial dysfunction and impaired angiogenesis. Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and oxidative stresses were shown to play {{a pivotal role in}} the development of endothelial dysfunction in diabetes. Hemeoxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) was shown to protect against oxidative stress in diabetes; however, its role in alleviating ER stress-induced endothelial dysfunction remains not fully elucidated. We aim here to test the protective role of HO- 1 against high glucose-mediated ER stress and endothelial dysfunction and understand the underlying mechanisms with special emphasis on oxidative stress, inflammation and cell death. Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) were grown in either physiological or intermittent high concentrations of glucose for 5 days in the presence or absence of Cobalt (III) Protoporphyrin IX chloride (CoPP, HO- 1 inducer) or 4 -Phenyl Butyric Acid (PBA, ER stress inhibitor). Using an integrated cellular and molecular approach, we then assessed ER stress and inflammatory responses, in addition to apoptosis and angiogenic capacity in these cells. Our results show that HO- 1 induction prevented high glucose-mediated increase of mRNA and protein expression of key ER stress markers. Cells incubated with high glucose exhibited high levels of oxidative stress, activation of major inflammatory and apoptotic responses [nuclear factor (NF) -κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) ] and increased rate of apoptosis; however, cells pre-treated with CoPP or PBA were fully protected. In addition, high glucose enhanced caspases 3 and 7 cleavage and activity and augmented cleaved poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) expression whereas HO- 1 induction prevented these effects. Finally, HO- 1 induction and ER stress inhibition prevented high glucose-induced reduction in NO release and impaired the angiogenic capacity of HUVECs, and enhanced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -A expression. Altogether, we show here the critical role of ER stress-mediated cell death in diabetes-induced endothelial dysfunction and impaired angiogenesis and underscore the role of HO- 1 induction as a key therapeutic modulator for ER stress response in ischemic disorders and diabetes. Our results also highlight the complex interplay between ER stress response and oxidative stress.

Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 B (PTP 1 B) expression levels {{as well as other}} genes involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response are increased in adipose tissue of obese, high-fat-diet-fed mice. In this study we investigated if serum and/or adipose tissue RBP 4 protein levels and expression levels of PTP 1 B and other ER stress-response genes are altered in obese and obese/diabetic men resident in northeast Scotland. Methods: We studied three groups of male volunteers: (1) normal/overweight (body mass index [BMI] &lt; 30), (2) obese (BMI &gt; 30), and (3) obese/diabetic (BMI &gt; 30) controlling their diabetes either by diet or the antidiabetic drug metformin. We analyzed their serum and adipose tissue RBP 4 protein levels as well as adipose tissue mRNA expression of PTP 1 B, binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP), activated transcription factor 4 (ATF 4), and glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP 94) alongside other markers of adiposity (percentage body fat, leptin, cholesterol, triglycerides) and insulin resistance (oral glucose tolerance tests, insulin, homeostatic model assessment&ndash;insulin resistance, C-reactive protein, and adiponectin). Results: We found that obese Scottish subjects had significantly higher serum RBP 4 protein levels in comparison to the normal/overweight subjects (P &lt; 0. 01). Serum RBP 4 levels were normalized in obese/diabetic subjects treated with diet or metformin (P &lt; 0. 05). Adipose tissue RBP 4 protein levels were comparable between all three groups of subjects as were serum and adipose transthyretin levels. Adipose tissue PTP 1 B mRNA levels were increased in obese subjects in comparison to normal/overweight subjects (P &lt; 0. 05); however diet and/or metformin treatment did not reverse this effect. Adipose tissue BIP, ATF 4, and GRP 94 expression levels were unchanged in obese and obese/diabetic subjects. Conclusions: Human obesity results in an increase in serum but not adipose tissue RBP 4 protein levels, and these are normalized in obese/diabetic subjects, which exhibit improvements in insulin sensitivity through diet or metformin treatment. However, while adipose tissue PTP 1 B mRNA levels increase in obese Scottish subjects, these remain high in obese/diabetics on diet or metformin treatment.

40|$|L'analyse des eaux pose à nouveau la {{question}} de l'importance des faciès gypso-salifères dans le Trias de la dorsale kabyle du Djurdjura. Cette dernière est un élément de l'orogène alpin périméditerranéen où le Trias est décrit comme étant formé essentiellement de grès et de pélites avec des niveaux marneux et dolomitiques. Dans les régions telliennes, plus méridionales, il est représenté par des formations marno-gypsifères de grande épaisseur (Trias tellien), {{en position}} tectonique constamment anormale. On ne rencontre généralement pas de formations évaporitiques en surface dans le massif du Djurdjura. Les analyses chimiques de la majorité des sources le confirment. Toutefois la source de Tinzert, dont l'impluvium est constitué essentiellement de calcaires montre un cortège d'éléments d'origine évaporitique (fortes teneurs en chlorures, sodium et sulfates et la présence du strontium) et plaide pour la présence de niveaux évaporitiques du Trias, à la base de l'aquifère drainé par cette source. Le rapport Sr 2 +/Ca 2 + (en ‰) de la source de Tinzert (3 1000 mg·l- 1), sodium (> 500 mg·l- 1), sulfates (> 200 mg·l- 1) and potassium (> 25 mg·l- 1). During flood periods, because of dilution and quick conduit flows {{in the upper}} calcareous zones, the water type becomes calcium bicarbonate. During this period, waters flowing out of the spring are traced by the limestone shallow waters (transit of epikarstic waters). On top and upstream from Tinzert, less than 20 metres to the South, Tala <b>Agouni</b> Lansar displays a very different chemical type, calcium bicarbonate. This fact demonstrates that Tinzert sodium chloride content is acquired by water which stays in the deep saturated zone (Figs. 3 et 4), and that longitudinal faults divide the lithological units into segments. Analyses of strontium in waters demonstrate {{that most of the}} springs (ABDESSELAM, 1995) have low Sr 2 + contents (0. 06 - 0. 23 mg·l- 1). Tinzert spring has a much higher content (0. 35 - 1. 83 mg·l- 1; Table 1). The use of the Sr 2 + /Ca 2 + ratio (‰) enabled us to distinguish among aquifers completely developed in limestones, others related to Triassic sandstones and one related to salty layers. The map of Sr 2 + /Ca 2 + ratios indicates that the springs related to Triassic outcrops have the higher values (Fig. 3). According to the Sr 2 + /Ca 2 + ratio (‰), three groups can be distinguished:- springs related to limestones, with no relationship with Triassic formations, have a low Sr 2 +/Ca 2 + ratio (5 ‰) classifies this water into the category of waters originating from the alpine Triassic evaporites (MEYBECK, 1984). This high ratio is coupled with the high sulfate, and especially the chloride and sodium content of these waters. This spring is situated on the trace of a north-east thrust sheet sole that probably includes Triassic in its lower part, which concerns the whole Haïzer massif of about 8 km. The water transit is probably either in the upper thrust sheet, or in the lower one, following the East-West axis lowering of the structure. The springs of the Djurdjura display well-differentiated hydrochemical responses. Several springs that only drain limestone have a standard calcium bicarbonate chemical type (Sr 2 +/Ca 2 + < 1 ‰). Other springs (Sr 2 +/Ca 2 + = 1 - 1. 5 ‰) are characteristic of waters that have flowed in the sandstone and dolomitic Triassic layers, which are observed on the outcrops. Tinzert spring at least, which drains the middle part of the limestone range (Fig. 4, Sr 2 +/Ca 2 += 3 - 8. 77 ‰), is characterised by waters which have transited through the evaporitic Triassic. The waters of Tinzert spring have also high chloride, sodium and sulfate contents. In the Djurdjura, where evaporitic Triassic formations do not generally outcrop, except in very small lenses, an argument can be made for the existence of deep evaporitic Triassic deposits {{on the basis of the}} hydrochemical response of perennial springs...|$|E
