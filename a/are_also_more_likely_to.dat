5|$|A complex {{mixture of}} genetic and {{environmental}} factors influences {{the risk of the}} development of alcoholism. Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence the risk of alcoholism, and may be indicated by a family history of alcoholism. One paper has found that alcohol use at an early age may influence the expression of genes which increase the risk of alcohol dependence. Individuals who have a genetic disposition to alcoholism <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> begin drinking at an earlier age than average. Also, a younger age of onset of drinking is associated with an increased risk of the development of alcoholism, and about 40 percent of alcoholics will drink excessively by their late adolescence. It is not entirely clear whether this association is causal, and some researchers have been known to disagree with this view.|$|E
5|$|A {{scoring system}} to {{evaluate}} material {{is to add}} up the piece values of the material on the board. In chess, when a pawn equals one unit, a bishop or knight is worth three, a rook five and a queen nine. These values are {{a consequence of the}} difference in mobility of the pieces. In bughouse, piece values differ because pieces in reserve essentially have the same mobility as they can be dropped on any vacant square. The pawn relatively gains importance in bughouse chess, as its very limited mobility does not handicap reserve pawns. They can for instance be dropped to block non-contact checks. Pawns can be dropped onto the seventh rank, one step away from promotion, which again adds to their importance. Long-range pieces like the queen or the rook lose relative value, due to the constantly changing pawn structure. They <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be hemmed in. A valuation system, first suggested by FICS-player Gnejs, often applied to bughouse is pawn=1, bishop=knight=rook=2 and queen=4.|$|E
5|$|Northern mockingbirds {{are famous}} for their song repertoires. Studies have shown that males sing songs at the {{beginning}} of breeding season to attract females. Unmated males sing songs in more directions and sing more bouts than mated males. In addition, unmated males perform more flight displays than mated males. The mockingbirds usually nest several times during one breeding season. Depending on the stage of breeding and the mating status, a male mockingbird will vary his song production. The unmated male keeps close track of this change. He sings in one direction when he perceives a chance to lure a female from the nest of the mated male. Unmated males <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> use elevated perches to extend his songs to a further range. Though the mockingbirds are socially monogamous, mated males have been known to sing to attract additional mates.|$|E

2500|$|So far {{research}} has provided {{support for the}} assertion that nature connectedness (at a subjective level) is a reliable predictor of environmental behaviors. For instance, nature relatedness was found to relate to concern for the environment, as people who scored high on nature relatedness <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to belong to environmental organizations, and declare themselves environmentalists.

5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{cultural}} factors that reinforce this practice. These include the child's financial future, her dowry, social ties and social status, prevention of premarital sex, extramarital pregnancy and STIs. The arguments against it include interruption of education and loss of employment prospects, and hence economic status, as well as loss of normal childhood and its emotional maturation and social isolation. Child marriage places the girl in a relationship where she is in a major imbalance of power and perpetuates the gender inequality that contributed to the practice in the first place. Also in the case of minors, there are the issues of human rights, non-consensual sexual activity and forced marriage and a 2016 joint report of the WHO and Inter-Parliamentary Union places the two concepts together as Child, Early and Forced Marriage (CEFM), as did the 2014 Girl Summit (see below). In addition the likely pregnancies at a young age are associated with higher medical risks for both mother and child, multiple pregnancies and less access to care with pregnancy being amongst the leading causes of death amongst girls aged 15–19. Girls married under age <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be the victims of domestic violence.|$|E

Obesity during adolescence has been found to increase mortality rates during adulthood.|$|E
25|$|About 70 {{percent of}} ECT {{patients}} are women. This {{may be due}} to the fact that women are more likely to be diagnosed with depression.

25|$|Older {{people have}} {{different}} requirements from society and government, and frequently have differing values as well, such as for property and pension rights. Older people <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> vote, {{and in many}} countries the young are forbidden from voting. Thus, the aged have comparatively more, or at least different, political influence.|$|E

25|$|While {{agreeable}} {{individuals are}} habitually likely to help others, disagreeable {{people may be}} more likely to cause harm. Researchers have found that low levels of agreeableness are associated with hostile thoughts and aggression in adolescents, as well as poor social adjustment.

25|$|Men {{are more}} likely to binge drink (up to 81 percent of alcohol binges are done by men) than women and men <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> develop alcohol {{dependence}} than women. People who are homozygous for the ALDH2 gene are less likely to binge-drink due to severe adverse effects that occur even with moderate amounts of alcohol consumption.|$|E

25|$|Between 40% and 50% of all {{children}} who develop cerebral palsy were born prematurely.

25|$|Bella moth {{caterpillars}} {{may have}} the ability to recognize other larvae as kin, as larvae are less likely to intrude upon siblings than non-siblings established in seedpods. However, siblings <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be similar in age and fighting ability. Therefore, larvae may not be recognizing kin but may simply be less likely to invade others of the same age and/or fighting ability.|$|E

25|$|In the past, {{mortality}} rates for females in child-bearing age groups {{were higher than}} for males at the same age. This {{is no longer the}} case, and female human life expectancy is considerably higher than that of males. The reasons for this are not entirely certain. Traditional arguments tend to favor sociology-environmental factors: historically, men have generally consumed more tobacco, alcohol and drugs than women in most societies, {{and are more likely to}} die from many associated diseases such as lung cancer, tuberculosis and cirrhosis of the liver. Men <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> die from injuries, whether unintentional (such as occupational, war or car accidents) or intentional (suicide). Men <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> die from most of the leading causes of death (some already stated above) than women. Some of these in the United States include: cancer of the respiratory system, motor vehicle accidents, suicide, cirrhosis of the liver, emphysema, prostate cancer, and coronary heart disease. These far outweigh the female mortality rate from breast cancer and cervical cancer.|$|E
