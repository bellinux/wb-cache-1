5|$|Initially the Order was a knightly brotherhood (Rittersbruderschaft), {{reflecting}} the overlapping religious and military aspects of medieval court life. Saint Hubert was {{the patron saint}} of hunters and knights. The founding of the Order of the Golden Fleece in the early 15th century started a trend in confraternal princely orders. The purpose of these, whether established by monarchs or princes, was to foster loyalty to a sovereign, replacing to the old Chivalric orders developed in the Crusades. Although some historians classify the Order of the Saint Hubert as a confraternal order, during its 600-year-life, its purpose changed as the fortunes <b>and</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dukes of Jülich and Berg and their successors changed.|$|E

25|$|The Labour Party {{originated}} in the late 19th century, meeting the demand for a new political party to represent the interests <b>and</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> urban working class, a demographic which had increased in number, and many of whom only gained suffrage {{with the passage of}} the Representation of the People Act 1884. Some members of the trades union movement became interested in moving into the political field, and after further extensions of the voting franchise in 1867 and 1885, the Liberal Party endorsed some trade-union sponsored candidates. The first Lib–Lab candidate to stand was George Odger in the Southwark by-election of 1870. In addition, several small socialist groups had formed around this time, with the intention of linking the movement to political policies. Among these were the Independent Labour Party, the intellectual and largely middle-class Fabian Society, the Marxist Social Democratic Federation and the Scottish Labour Party.|$|E

500|$|Charles Eaton died in Frankston on 12November 1979. Survived by {{his wife}} and two sons, he was cremated. In {{accordance}} with his wishes, his ashes were scattered near Tennant Creek, site of his 1929 forced landing during the search for the Kookaburra, from an RAAF Caribou on 15April 1981. His name figures prominently in the Northern Territory, commemorated by Lake Eaton in Central Australia, Eaton Place in the Darwin suburb of Karama, Charles Eaton Drive on the approach to Darwin International Airport, and the Charles Moth Eaton Saloon Bar in the Tennant Creek Goldfields Hotel. He is also honoured with a display at the Northern Territory Parliament, and a National Trust memorial at Tennant Creek Airport. At the RAAF's 2003 History Conference, Air Commodore Mark Lax, recalling Eaton's search-and-rescue missions between the wars, commented: [...] "Today, we might think of Eaton perhaps as the pioneer of our contribution to assistance to the civil community—a tradition that continues today. Perhaps I might jog your memory to a more recent series of rescues no less hazardous for all concerned—the amazing location of missing yachtsmen Thierry Dubois, Isabelle Autissier and Tony Bullimore by our P-3s that guided the Navy to their eventual rescue. My observation is that such activities remain vital for our relevance in that we must remain connected, supportive and responsive to the wants <b>and</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Australian community." ...|$|E
