5|$|The game's {{story and}} its ending have been open to much interpretation; the ending was {{purposely}} left vague and unanswered by Playdead. It {{was compared to}} other open-ended books, films and video games, where the viewer is left to interpret what they have read or seen. Some reviews suggested that the game is {{a representation of the}} religious nature of Limbo or purgatory, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> character completes the journey only to end at the same place he started, repeating the same journey when the player starts a new game. Another interpretation suggested the game is the boy's journey through Hell to reach Heaven, or to find closure for his sister's death. Another theory considers that either the boy or his sister or both are dead. Some theories attempted to incorporate details from the game, such as the change in setting <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> travels through the game suggesting the progression of man from child to adult to elder, or the similarities and differences between the final screen of the game where the boy meets a girl and the main menu where what could be human remains stand in their places.|$|E
5|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} begins with Carey, revisiting her youth, wandering {{a high school}} corridor and standing inside a classroom of schoolchildren playing various musical instruments with inter-cutting clips of men playing on drums. Clips of a schoolgirl playing Carey are also shown, with Carey shadowing her movements, and her efforts to catch a schoolboy's attention who in turn persistently ignores her, choosing to mess about {{in the classroom and}} corridors with his friends instead. Towards the end of the video, groups of schoolchildren are shown dancing in the corridor <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> she liked, now an adult, is following Carey around the school and trying to flirt with her, but Carey brushes him off. The official music video has achieved 3.3 million views on YouTube as of June 2017.|$|E

5|$|The player character, a boy scout, has {{approached}} a mansion {{looking for work}} during Bob a Job week. The door is answered by an old man wearing horn-rimmed glasses—the owner of the mansion. The man, a mad scientist, expresses surprise that the boy has managed {{to get past the}} guards and booby traps in the mansion's grounds. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> scout explains the reason for his visit, the scientist collapses, asking for his pills. At this point the game begins. The player must gather the 16 keys needed to unlock the safe and retrieve the scientist's pills before he passes away. During play the boy scout must negotiate the mansion's rooms, avoiding hazards and the mansion's staff, who have been told to protect the inventions within the mansion, using lethal force if necessary. The staff are unaware of the boy scout's purpose and will attack him should they come into contact.|$|E
5|$|It {{begins with}} a shot of Wade's face and the guitar introduction. He then sings {{the first line of}} lyrics, which is {{followed}} by a transition to a boy lying on a bed shirtless. As the video switches between Wade and the boy, it zooms on the bed frame (which has the same face from the album cover) and opens into another area. The boy is then seen walking around the new area looking around until he goes up nearby stairs. While going up the stairs, the video switches between shots of the boy going up the stairs and Wade singing the lyrics. Once up the stairs, the boy looks around and then walks into a bright light that he sees nearby. He walks through the bright archway into a dark room as the video switches to Lifehouse playing the song. After this, it switches to the boy as he looks up and the camera zooms out to reveal that he is in a giant maze. He then walks back where he came from to find that he is in a house with Lifehouse playing on the television. He then jumps off a window sill and appears tiny as he walks up to a book that is bigger than him. It then transitions to Lifehouse playing the song <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> gets up on a chair which slowly transcends into his original bed. The video then zooms out on the boy lying on his bed and then switches to the band. It ends with the boy walking into darkness and Wade's face looking on the floor.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens in}} a deserted, {{destroyed}} school hallway with Lee's character shown {{sitting on the}} ground. As the first verse begins, he slowly begins {{to stand up and}} makes his way through the hallway. The boy then sees a female teacher in a classroom who's stricken with fear and closes the door, realizing that the boy is the cause of the damage. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> makes his way outside the school building, a police car arrives and the teacher rushes outside to tell the policeman about the boy, who then quickly rides a bicycle home to pack his things. While at home, he sees a news report about the incident, causing him to quickly gather his things to flee. Several policemen then appear outside {{the front door of the}} boy's house, while he tries to escape through the back door. The boy realizes that the door is locked so he uses his telekinetic powers to grab the keys from the kitchen bench. The policemen then enter the house to find that the boy has escaped, but find a teddy bear and a plush frog floating in the air. The final scene shows the boy running away from a SWAT team in the woods. The boy is caught by one of the men who pushes him to the ground. The video ends with the boy using his supernatural powers once again to push the men away in a burst of power; this references how the boy destroyed the school in the first place, as he's in the same position he was in at the beginning of the video. The aftermath of the outburst in the end, however, remains unknown.|$|E

25|$|Early {{the next}} morning, Abraham brought Hagar and Ishmael out together. He gave her bread {{and water and}} sent them away. The two wandered in the {{wilderness}} of Beersheba until her bottle of water was completely consumed. In a moment of despair, she burst into tears. After God heard the boy's voice, an angel of the Lord confirmed to Hagar that he would become a great nation. A well of water then appeared so that it saved their lives. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> grew, he became a skilled archer living in the wilderness of Paran. Eventually his mother found a wife for Ishmael from her home country, the land of Egypt.|$|E
25|$|The spoiled and jaded Duchess Josiana, the illegitimate {{daughter}} of King James II, is bored by the dull routine of court. Her fiancé, David Dirry-Moir, {{to whom she}} has been engaged since infancy, tells the Duchess that the only cure for her boredom is Gwynplaine. Josiana attends one of Gwynplaine's performances, and is aroused by the combination of his virile grace and his facial deformity. Gwynplaine is aroused by Josiana's physical beauty and haughty demeanor. Later, {{an agent of the}} royal court arrives at the caravan and compels Gwynplaine to follow him. Gwynplaine is ushered to a dungeon in London, where a physician named Hardquannone is being tortured to death. Hardquannone recognizes Gwynplaine, and identifies him <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> whose abduction and disfigurement Hardquannone arranged twenty-three years earlier. A flashback relates the doctor's story.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of a heart}} condition, Gacy {{was ordered}} to avoid all sports at school. An average student with few friends, he was an {{occasional}} target for bullying by neighborhood children and classmates. He was known to assist the school truant officer and volunteer to run errands for teachers and neighbors. During the fourth grade, Gacy began to experience blackouts. He was occasionally hospitalized because of these seizures, and also in 1957 for a burst appendix. Gacy later estimated that he spent almost {{a year in the}} hospital for these episodes between the ages of 14 and 18, and attributed the decline in his grades to his time out of school. His father suspected the episodes were an effort to gain sympathy and attention; on one occasion, he openly accused his son of faking <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> lay in a hospital bed.|$|E

25|$|Webelos Scouts have {{a choice}} of uniforms: the Cub Scout uniform or the Boy Scout field uniform with blue {{shoulder}} loops. The Webelos cap is green with a plaid panel and the oval Webelos emblem; the plaid is made up of the Cub Scout blue and gold and the Boy Scout red and green. The neckerchief is plaid with the Webelos logo and is worn with the slide with Webelos emblem. The blue Cub Scout belt, using the Webelos belt buckle, is worn with the Cub Scout uniform. Scouts wearing the Boy Scout Uniform may choose to use the Webelos belt buckle with either the blue Cub Scout or the green Boy Scout belt; Cub Scout belt loop recognitions, however, fit only the blue belt. The Webelos den may elect to wear a den emblem in place of the den number; the patches are the same <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boy</b> Scout patrol patches.|$|E
25|$|Then, a {{rainstorm}} strikes the city, threatening {{to cancel the}} game for which Juror 7 has tickets. Juror 4 doubts the boy's alibi of being at the movies, {{because he could not}} recall it in much detail. Juror 8 tests how well Juror 4 remembers previous days, which he does, with difficulty. Juror 2 questions the likelihood that the boy, who was more than half a foot shorter than his father, could have inflicted the downward stab wound found in the body. Next, Jurors 3 and 8 conduct an experiment to see whether a shorter person could stab downwards on a taller person. The experiment proves the possibility, but Juror 5 steps up and demonstrates the correct way to hold and use a switchblade; revealing that anyone skilled with a switchblade, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> would be, would always stab underhanded at an upwards angle against an opponent who was taller than they, as the grip of stabbing downwards would be too awkward and the act of changing hands too time-consuming.|$|E
25|$|The {{next morning}} during roll call, Miklós finds Saul {{and tells him}} that he needs a {{replacement}} body, {{similar to the one}} Saul has taken. The prisoners are then summoned into the crematorium to get back to work, where they discover that Biedermann and his unit have been gassed by the SS. Abraham starts a riot with the other prisoners and they attack the SS guards, starting the rebellion. After managing to escape from the crematorium, Saul retrieves the boy's body and escapes to the woods with Braun and few other prisoners. When they reach a river, Saul finds a chance to bury the body, only to discover that Braun is a fraud when he can't recite the Kaddish. When he hears the guards approaching, Saul tries to carry the body across the river. Unable to manage the current with the added weight, he loses his grasp on the sack and is pulled out of the river by Rabbi Frankel as the body floats away. When the prisoners arrive at a shed in the forest, they start to discuss a plan to join the Polish resistance. Saul notices a young peasant boy peeking into the shed and smiles at him, the only time he is shown with a smile. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> runs away, guards run past {{in the direction of the}} shed.
