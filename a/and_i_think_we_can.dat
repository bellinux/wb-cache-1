500|$|Following {{confirmation}} {{about the}} artist's withdrawal, the journal's Aaron Spencer said local residents are being {{deprived of the}} sculpture's [...] "disturbing fantastical whimsy". In an article called [...] "Let's save the giant baby-faced deer statue!", he wrote: [...] "As we all know, I love this statue. I love it a lot. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> save it. There are lots of places in Portland that could use some beautification, and a little public art {{can go a long}} way." [...] Spencer and a colleague compiled a gallery of images created using Adobe Photoshop to illustrate the sculpture's potential.|$|E
500|$|Brewer told a Channel 5 website writer {{that the}} rain was the biggest {{challenge}} of the night shoot, as it was [...] "beyond freezing". She also revealed that she ran in shoes {{that she had not}} broken in and they made her feet bleed. The actress added [...] "It was incredibly stressful but I guess it was stress in a good way. There were months of preparation involved so that it could run like clockwork. So I guess it was stressful in the sense the emotional stakes were heightened for a two-week period. It was exhausting <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> all say we were happy once it was over. But the final result was worth it." [...] McGregor filmed his final scene out of sequence at the Melbourne studios. He explained that they had already shot Mark's last scene on location, then went back inside to do the studio shots. He revealed [...] "The final thing I filmed was a conversation between Mark and Kyle, where they're saying goodbye. It was a bit sad, but it was basically just these two guys hugging each other – with the cast and crew watching!" ...|$|E
500|$|Susan and Karl were {{childhood}} sweethearts {{who married}} in 1978, before they both graduated from university. Karl has cheated on Susan twice with Sarah Beaumont (Nicola Charles) and Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte) {{and the couple}} have broken up and divorced, but have later reunited and remarried. Woodburne has named the Karl, Susan and Izzy love triangle {{as one of her}} favourite storylines. Woodburne believes that Karl and Susan have a strong connection that is [...] "based upon such a good grounding". Karl and Susan are best friends who enjoy each other's company, share a deep connection and take joy in each other's quirks and ways. Woodburne described them as having a [...] "really solid foundation for a marriage" [...] and she has said that she does not want to see Susan and Karl's relationship break up again. Holy Soap have called Susan and Karl [...] "contenders for the friskiest couple on Ramsay Street". Following their [...] "passionate arguments", the couple enjoy making up together. They have a healthy attraction for each other. Fletcher says he and Woodburne find the scenes [...] "funny". Fletcher said [...] "Karl and Susan every now and again do go through a phase where they become slightly more amorous than in their tougher times and tougher storylines – suffice to say it's not bawdy, but I think the audience will enjoy the fun aspect". Karl and Susan have been caught in the nude together on three occasions; at the beach, in Lou Carpenter's (Tom Oliver) spa and when they went skinny-dipping in the bush. When asked what makes Karl and Susan popular with viewers, Woodburne said [...] "Because I think they're so flawed. There's two things: they make horrendous mistakes, both of them, but they both are coming from a place of well meaning. They're both wanting to try and {{do the right thing and}} be helpful, but so often they get it so terribly wrong, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> all relate to that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rosberg {{was delighted}} {{at his first}} podium finish, and was looking towards {{the rest of the}} year for similar results. [...] "I think we have a solid car to start the season with. I am hoping to have a nice {{development}} through the season <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> have a good year.|$|E
2500|$|CBS News journalist, Bob Schieffer, {{asked about}} the {{allegations}} on Imus in the Morning, stating, [...] "I believe that's a story {{that we will be}} avoiding, because it appears to me that there's absolutely nothing to it ... This seems to be just sort of a staple of modern campaigns, that you got through at least one love child, which turns out not to be a love child. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> all do better than this one." [...] Mickey Kaus, a journalist at Slate, speculated that the lack of mainstream coverage was motivated by a desire not to harm Elizabeth Edwards, who was fighting cancer at the time. Kaus also considered the possibility of news organizations taking a [...] "wait-and-see" [...] attitude, pending the results of the Iowa caucuses.|$|E
2500|$|Not all viewers {{considered}} Willow and Tara's relationship {{a positive}} development. Some fans loyal to Willow reacted angrily as {{she chose to}} be with Tara when Oz made himself available, and they lashed out at Tara and Amber Benson on the fansite message boards. Whedon replied sardonically, [...] "we're going to shift away from this whole lifestyle choice that Willow has made. Just wipe the slate. From now on, Willow {{will no longer be}} a Jew. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> all breathe easier." [...] However, he seriously explained his motivation, writing [...] "My show is about emotion. Love is the most powerful, messy, delightful and dangerous emotion... Willow's in love. I think it's cool." [...] Hannigan was also positive about the way the character and her relationship with Tara was written: [...] "It is not about being controversial or making a statement. I think the show is handling it really nicely. It's about two people who care about each other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] agreed Louise; [...] "we all would. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> {{could turn}} out a very creditable paper--for Millville. But wouldn't it {{cost a lot of}} money?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The fairies, of course, {{you have}} invited? It {{has always been}} usual, in our family, on an {{occasion}} like this; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> have neglected them a little of late." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have put}} up a good fight, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> shall win; but, while you will {{understand}} me better by-and-by what you have offered me almost hurts," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I'm well {{satisfied}} {{to have you}} near me, in an alarm, Chippewa. We've stood by each other once, in troublesome times; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do as much, ag'in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank God;--yes. I {{was looking}} at Brownriggs to-day,--and Ingram's. I don't think we'll sell either. I have a plan, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> pull through without it. It is {{so much easier to}} sell than to buy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing for it {{till the}} river breaks, baron, {{and then a}} dash with La Bijou. St. Vincent, you had better bring your {{blankets}} up and sleep here to-night. We'll need three paddles, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> get McPherson." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I heard a Thrums woman say {{it would}} account for my being called Grizel, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> came to Scotland to look for him, {{but it is so}} long, long ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{might find}} a trail out of the swamp to some plantation," [...] {{suggested}} Harold Bird, [...] "but that would take time, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> ought to be following the launch." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You will {{do nothing}} of the sort. If the Masai come, they come, {{and there is an}} end on it; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> give them a pretty warm greeting. I would not show any man the door for all the Masai in the world.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We mustn't {{go beyond}} the point, Bertie, or we may be dashed against {{the foot of the}} cliff. We will climb up that rock to the left; it is not too steep, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> manage it. From there we shall get a good view of this side of the house and of the {{situation}} in general." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{wait too}} long, Bull," [...] Terence said. [...] "There is a steeper slope behind you. However, I don't {{think they will}} come up very far--not, at least, until they are reinforced. There is another body just starting, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> hold on here until they join the skirmishing line. As soon as they do so, sound the order for the men to fall back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have put}} up a good fight, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> shall win, but, while you will {{understand}} me better by and by, what you have offered me almost hurts," [...] he said.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{this great}} grace and noble virtue should surely {{be in our}} Lord, from whom all graces and virtues come; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> need not look far through the gospels to find it.|$|R

6000|$|His {{love for}} Miss Chaworth, to use Lord Byron's own expression, was [...] "the {{romance of the}} most romantic period of his life," [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> trace the effect of it {{throughout}} the whole course of his writings, coming up every now and then, like some lurking theme which runs through a complicated piece of music, and links it all in a pervading chain of melody.|$|E
60|$|Firstly, to {{reciprocate}} all your cordial and affectionate wishes for the New Year, and {{to express my}} earnest hope that we may go on through many years to come, as we have gone on through many years that are gone. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> say that we doubt whether any two men can have gone on more happily and smoothly, or with greater trust and confidence in one another.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go {{up to the}} top again," [...] Hawtry said, {{climbing}} back to them. [...] "Bring {{down one}} of those spars we brought down, a block, a long rope, and a short one to serve as a guy. Get half-a-dozen more hands. You'd better fix a rope at the top firmly, and use it to steady you as you return. There's a ship ashore just underneath us, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> get down." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{wine was}} excellent, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> all came {{separately}} and secretly {{to the same}} conclusion--that our chance of getting through the evening was intimately connected with our resolution in getting through the bottles.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dan's goose is {{the largest}} and the fattest, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> had better kill him for the [...] .Thanksgiving dinner," [...] Dan heard his father say, three days before Thanksgiving; and Mrs. Hardy had replied: ...|$|R
5000|$|Sony BMG Nashville {{chairman}} Joe Galante {{thought that}} the duo and the label [...] "strayed musically from what the base had been. They have an edge to their sound, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> got a little too soft." ...|$|R
6000|$|I am bent upon {{striking}} at the piratical newspapers {{with the}} sharpest edge I can put upon my small axe, and {{hope in the}} next session of Parliament to stop their entrance into Canada. For the first time within the memory of man, the professors of English literature seem disposed to act together on this question. It {{is a good thing}} to aggravate a scoundrel, if one can do nothing else, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> make them smart a little in this way. [...] .|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not wish}} you to mention this matter to him. I would rather open it to him, myself. We will go on another fishing {{expedition}} together, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> approach it, then, on a more pleasant footing than we could here. He has modelled himself so thoroughly upon me that the matter could only be approached in so intensely a businesslike way, here, that I feel sure we should not arrive at anything like such a satisfactory arrangement as we might do, elsewhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, señor, {{it would}} be {{throwing}} away our lives. They will guess that we shall probably attempt such a thing, and I {{have no doubt that}} they will move away, if they haven't done so already, and hide themselves among other rocks. Then if we dashed forward to the place where they had been, they would pour a volley into us and finish us at once; for if they were lying twenty yards away they ought certainly to hit every one of us, as they have eight shots to fire. At present I have no doubt they are talking, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> safely get back to where we piled up the saddles and bales. We can defend ourselves better there than here. We can then talk matters over quietly." ...|$|E
