5|$|Following Sean's {{birth in}} 1975, Lennon took a hiatus {{from the music}} {{industry}} and became a househusband to care for his infant son.

She has stated that the couple was thinking about going out to dinner after spending several hours in <b>a</b> <b>recording</b> <b>studio,</b> but were returning to their apartment instead, because Lennon wanted to see Sean before he was put to bed. Following the murder, Ono went into complete seclusion for an extended period.|$|E

5|$|In 1975, Pink Floyd {{bought a}} three-storey block of church halls at 35 Britannia Row in Islington, north London.

5|$|Miking a Leslie is also {{important}} in <b>a</b> <b>recording</b> <b>studio,</b> as the choice and positioning of microphones determines the overall recorded sound. A popular recommendation is two Shure SM57s on the horn and a Sennheiser MD421 on the drum. Recording Magazine's Dave Martin suggests a similar setup, with various microphone models used as stereo pairs on the horn but using an Electro-Voice RE20 on the drum instead. Keith Emerson recorded his Leslie using a single mic each on the horn and the drum, but with the covers removed.|$|E

5|$|Watts-Russell {{suggested}} {{it would be}} enjoyable for the Breeders record at a studio in Scotland called the Palladium. It was a house that included <b>a</b> <b>recording</b> <b>studio</b> on the first floor, as well as bedrooms upstairs. The band members sometimes recorded wearing their pajamas, and more than once went to a local pub without changing into regular clothes. The studio was booked for two weeks, but the album itself only took several days to record; during the remaining time, the Breeders recorded a John Peel session, and a television crew filmed a video of the band.|$|E

5|$|In 1975, Pink Floyd {{bought a}} three-storey group of church halls at 35 Britannia Row in Islington and began {{converting}} the building into <b>a</b> <b>recording</b> <b>studio</b> and storage space. In 1976, they recorded their tenth album, Animals, in their newly finished 24-track studio. The concept of Animals originated with Waters, {{loosely based on}} George Orwell's political fable, Animal Farm. The album's lyrics described different classes of society as dogs, pigs, and sheep. Hipgnosis received credit for the packaging of Animals; however, Waters designed the final concept, choosing {{an image of the}} ageing Battersea Power Station, over which they superimposed an image of a pig.|$|E
5|$|Kiedis {{knew that}} the band's sound would inevitably change when Navarro joined. In June 1994, the band entered The Sound Factory, <b>a</b> <b>recording</b> <b>studio</b> in Los Angeles, to record the album. The band {{completed}} a few basic tracks, when Kiedis began having difficulty singing. He had been through a dental procedure in which an addictive sedative, Valium, was used; this caused him to relapse, and he once again became dependent on drugs. Kiedis had slipped from five years of sobriety and began reusing narcotics he'd sworn never to use again. The band took a short break from recording to perform at Woodstock '94, {{which was the first}} show Navarro played with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.|$|E
5|$|Maben was {{concerned}} {{that one of the}} problems with the film was that it was too short. In early 1973, Maben was fly fishing with Waters, and suggested the possibility of improving the film by watching them at work in <b>a</b> <b>recording</b> <b>studio.</b> Subsequently, Maben was invited with a small crew using a single 35mm camera to Abbey Road Studios to film supposed recording sessions of The Dark Side of the Moon, as well as interviews conducted off-camera by Maben, and footage of the band eating and talking at the studio cafeteria. Maben was particularly happy about this footage, feeling it captured the spontaneous humour of the band. This version premiered on 21 August 1974, and ran for 80 minutes.|$|E

5|$|On Sunday morning, April 25, 1999, Roger Troutman was fatally wounded as {{a result}} of an {{apparent}} murder-suicide that was orchestrated by his older brother, Larry. Roger was shot several times in the torso by Larry as he exited <b>a</b> <b>recording</b> <b>studio</b> in Dayton, Ohio. Roger was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital, but died shortly after. Larry's body was found in a car a short distance away from the murder scene. There were no witnesses at the time, and Larry's motive for the murder of Roger remains unclear; however, there were increasingly large troubles over money surrounding Larry who managed the family-run housing company, Troutman Enterprises. The business filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy, owing $400,000 in delinquent taxes. Larry was also possibly angry over Roger firing him as manager for his music career, of which Larry had been for several years.|$|E
5|$|The Independent {{newspaper}} apologised on 21 August 2006, {{writing that}} on 14 June 2006, the paper had wrongly reported Mardas' involvement with Apple Electronics Ltd. They corrected the earlier piece by writing that Mardas {{had not been}} a company employee, but a director and shareholder of Apple Electronics, and was not sacked, but resigned his directorship in May 1971, while still retaining his shareholding, until giving it to Apple Corps some years later. The paper accepted that Mardas ‚Äúdid not claim to have invented electric paint, a flying saucer or <b>a</b> <b>recording</b> <b>studio</b> with a ‚Äòsonic force field‚Äô or cause his employers to waste money on such ideas. We apologise to Mr. Mardas for these errors".|$|E
5|$|The {{competitors}} in the 1984 sale of ATV Music included Charles Koppelman and Marty Bandier's New York-based the Entertainment Co., Virgin Records, New York real estate tycoon Samuel J. LeFrak, and financier Charles Knapp. On November 20, 1984, Jackson sent a bid of $46million to Holmes √† Court. Branca suggested {{the amount of the}} bid after having spent time evaluating the earnings of the catalogue and learning of another bid for $39million. Jackson was only interested in the music copyrights, but the package also included buildings, <b>a</b> <b>recording</b> <b>studio</b> and studio equipment. The two sides signed a non-binding memorandum of mutual interest in December 1984 and Jackson's team began a four-month process of verifying ATV Music's legal documents, financial reports, and every significant composition in the nearly 4000-song catalog.|$|E
