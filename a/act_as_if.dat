5|$|Because {{evolutionary}} naturalism proposes {{an empirical}} account of morality, {{it does not}} require morality to exist objectively; Linville considers the view that this will lead to moral scepticism or antirealism. C. S. Lewis argued that, if evolutionary naturalism is accepted, human morality cannot be described as absolute and objective because moral statements cannot be right or wrong. Despite this, Lewis argued, those who accept evolutionary naturalism still <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> objective moral truths exist, leading Lewis to reject naturalism as incoherent. As an alternative ethical theory, Lewis offered a form of divine command theory which equated God with goodness and treated goodness as an essential part of reality, thus asserting God's existence.|$|E
5|$|Rigmor Mydtskov (1925–2010) was a Danish court {{photographer}} who is remembered both for her portraits of artists performing in Danish theatres {{but also for}} her many portraits of Queen Margrethe {{and other members of}} the Danish royal family. Realizing that people in such positions tend to <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> masked, she sought to portray the person behind the mask, although she often succeeded in maintaining a little of the secrecy. As a portrait photographer, she was gentle, intuitive and confident. Her life's work is a result of a constant, concentrated effort.|$|E
5|$|The book {{identifies}} {{a corporate}} underpinning influencing public opinion {{by way of}} companies which derive profit from the fossil fuel industry. Washington and Cook write that politicians often use weasel words {{as a form of}} spin and propaganda, in order to <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{they are going to do}} something about climate change, while in actuality remaining passive on the issue. The authors go on to identify a greater level of denial— within the wider public itself. They argue that society enables denial of climate science through inaction and resistance to the scientific consensus. The authors conclude that if the public stopped denying climate change, the problem itself could realistically be significantly addressed.|$|E

5|$|It was not Burr, but the Romantic {{poet and}} writer Percy Bysshe Shelley {{who had the}} {{greatest}} impact on Imlay and her sisters' lives. Impressed by Godwin's Political Justice, Shelley wrote to him and the two started corresponding. In 1812, Shelley asked if Imlay, then 18 and the daughter of one of his heroes, Mary Wollstonecraft, could come live with him, his new wife, and her sister. Having never actually met Shelley and being sceptical of his motivations (Shelley had eloped to marry his wife, Harriet), Godwin refused. When Shelley finally came to visit the Godwins, all three girls were enamoured of him, particularly Imlay. Both Shelley and Imlay were interested in discussing radical politics; for example, Shelley liked to <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> class were irrelevant, but she argued that it was significant in daily affairs.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecophilous (ant-loving) {{caterpillars}} of {{the butterfly}} family Lycaenidae (e.g., blues, coppers, or hairstreaks) are herded by the ants, led to feeding {{areas in the}} daytime, and brought inside the ants' nest at night. The caterpillars have a gland which secretes honeydew when the ants massage them. Some caterpillars produce vibrations and sounds that are perceived by the ants. A similar adaptation {{can be seen in}} Grizzled skipper butterflies that emit vibrations by expanding their wings in order to communicate with ants, which are natural predators of these butterflies. Other caterpillars have evolved from ant-loving to ant-eating: these myrmecophagous caterpillars secrete a pheromone that makes the ants <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the caterpillar is one of their own larvae. The caterpillar is then taken into the ant nest where it feeds on the ant larvae.|$|E
5|$|The {{impending}} {{dinner with}} Mr. Burns divides the Simpson household. Homer pragmatically supports Mr. Burns, while Marge and Lisa oppose him. Before the dinner arrives, Mr. Burns's advisers prepare {{the family for}} the event, even giving them pre-written questions to ask in lieu of conversation. Lisa becomes disillusioned by it all, but Marge tells her not to worry. To everyone's surprise, Marge serves Blinky for dinner. Mr. Burns tries to <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it does not bother him, but {{is not able to}} keep from spitting it out. The cameras flash as the bite flies through the air, {{and by the time the}} chunk hits the floor the press is gone and his governatorial campaign dissolves. Bailey wins the election and, despite Mr. Burns saying that Homer's dreams will be unfulfilled for as long as he is alive, the Simpson family happily get together again.|$|E

25|$|Reviewer Dale Arnold of the Baltimore Science Fiction Society {{suggests}} that magic has real political and societal {{impact in the}} Emberverse, {{whether or not it}} is actually the result of supernatural force or merely religious delusions, because the characters <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were real.|$|E

25|$|A {{founding}} {{figure of}} modern entertainment magic was Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin, originally a clockmaker, who opened a magic theatre in Paris in 1845. He transformed his art from one performed at fairs to a performance {{that the public}} paid to see at the theatre. His speciality was constructing mechanical automata that appeared to move and <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> alive. Many of Robert-Houdin's mechanisms for illusion were pirated by his assistant {{and ended up in}} the performances of his rivals, John Henry Anderson and Alexander Herrmann.|$|E

He will also throw the flag when a caller unethically uses the national television audience to promote a stock for self-interest. If a caller rambles on about a stock, Cramer will {{lie down on the}} floor of the set with a pillow and blanket and <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he is going to sleep.|$|E

25|$|Both {{director}} McTiernan and Schwarzenegger lost 25 pounds {{during the}} film. Schwarzenegger's weight loss {{was a professional}} choice. McTiernan lost the weight because he avoided the food in Mexico due to health concerns. Unlike McTiernan, most of {{the cast and crew}} suffered from traveler's diarrhea since the Mexican hotel in which they were living was having problems with the water purification. In an interview, Carl Weathers said the actors would secretly wake up as early as 3:00a.m. to work out before the day's shooting. Weathers also stated that he would <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> his physique was naturally given to him, and would work out only after the other actors were nowhere to be seen.|$|E
25|$|For Unger, society emerges {{not through}} {{compromise}} or the winnowing down of best options, but rather though conflict and struggle {{for control of}} political and material resources. The victors of this struggle come to set the terms of social interaction and transaction, which is then institutionalized through law. This emergent order Unger calls formative context. Under a particular formative context, routines are established and people come to believe and <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> their social words were coherent wholes that are perfectly intelligible and defensible. They {{come to see the}} existing arrangements as necessary. Unger calls this false necessity. In reality, these arrangements are arbitrary and hold together rather tenuously, which leaves them open to resistance and change. This opposition Unger calls negative capability.|$|E
25|$|After the Emperor's death, Prime Minister Li Si, who {{accompanied}} him, became extremely {{worried that the}} news of his death could trigger a general uprising in the Empire. It would take two months for the entourage to reach the capital, {{and it would not}} be possible to stop the uprising. Li Si decided to hide the death of the Emperor, and return to Xianyang. Most of the Imperial entourage accompanying the Emperor were left ignorant of the Emperor's death; only a younger son, Ying Huhai, who was travelling with his father, the eunuch Zhao Gao, Li Si, and five or six favourite eunuchs knew of the death. Li Si also ordered that two carts containing rotten fish be carried immediately before and after the wagon of the Emperor. The idea behind this was to prevent people from noticing the foul smell emanating from the wagon of the Emperor, where his body was starting to decompose severely as it was summertime. They also pulled down the shade so no one could see his face, changed his clothes daily, brought food and when he had to have important conversations, they would <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he wanted to send them a message.|$|E

500|$|Regarding the lyrics, Madonna had commented: [...] "I like innuendo, I like irony, I {{like the}} way things can be taken on {{different}} levels." [...] This statement highlighted the ambiguity of the lyrics of the song, which is hung on the word 'like'. Rooksby interpreted {{the meaning of the}} song in different ways to different people. He said that for women who were really virgins, the song encouraged them to hold their compose before they engaged in their very first sexual act. For sexually experienced girls, the song meant that {{they would be able to}} re-live the feelings of their first sexual encounter all over again. For the boys, the song presented a narcissistic image of them making the girl forget her past encounters and enjoy the sexual <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> for the first time.|$|E
500|$|Richard Dawkins and John Krebs in 1978 {{considered}} whether {{individuals of}} the same species would <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> attempting to deceive each other. They applied a [...] "selfish gene" [...] view of evolution to animals' threat displays to see if it would be in their genes' interests to give dishonest signals. They criticised previous ethologists, such as Nikolaas Tinbergen and Desmond Morris for suggesting that such displays were [...] "for the good of the species". They argued that such communication ought to be viewed as an evolutionary arms race in which signallers evolve to become better at manipulating receivers, while receivers evolve to become more resistant to manipulation. The game theoretical model of the war of attrition similarly suggests that threat displays ought not to convey any reliable information about intentions.|$|E

In the video, Madonna wore a cream colored corset, glistening black boots and styled her hair in platinum blond waves while Timberlake wore mainly denims and a scarf around his neck. Regarding the idea behind the music video, Madonna said that [...] "it was conceptualistic". She explained that the video was shot like a march past; [...] "It's a movement, and we want to take everybody with us."
