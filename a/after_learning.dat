40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study aims to: 1) develop science package of learning activity to promote analytical thinking based on Marzano’s principle with criterion 75 / 75 2) find out effective index, 3) compare learning achievement and analytical thinking between before and <b>after</b> <b>learned</b> through science package, and 4) study learning satisfaction of students who learned by science package to promote analytical thinking based on Marzano’s principle. Participants were Mathayomsaksa 2 students from Ban Kudlao, KhonKaen primary service area, academic year 2014 Research tools consisted of science package, achievement test, analytical thinking test, and learning satisfaction questionnaire. The findings can be reported that: 1) Science package to promote analytical thinking had criterion at 79. 38 / 71. 63 2) Learning activities can be reached 0. 5017 of effective index. 3) Student had learning achievementand analytical thinking scores <b>after</b> <b>learned</b> higher than those before at. 05 of statistical significance. 4) Students had the highest level of <b>learning</b> satisfaction <b>after</b> <b>learned</b> by science package based on Marzano’s principle.
