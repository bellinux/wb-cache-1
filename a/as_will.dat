Wagner later called this the most important event of his life. His personal circumstances certainly made him an easy convert to what he understood to be Schopenhauer's philosophy, a deeply pessimistic view of the human condition. He remained an adherent of Schopenhauer {{for the rest of}} his life.|$|E

At one point during the production, Welles informed Ritt {{that he did not want}} to memorize his lines, requesting instead that they be dubbed afterwards.
