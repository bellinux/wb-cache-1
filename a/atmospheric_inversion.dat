40|$|International audienceThe Indian Ocean (44 ° S– 30 ° N) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the global carbon cycle, yet it remains one of the most poorly sampled ocean regions. Several approaches have been used to estimate net sea–air CO 2 fluxes in this region: interpolated observations, ocean biogeochemical models, <b>atmospheric</b> and ocean <b>inversions.</b> As part of the RECCAP (REgional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes) project, we combine these different approaches to quantify and assess the magnitude and variability in Indian Ocean sea–air CO 2 fluxes between 1990 and 2009. Using all of the models and inversions, the median annual mean sea–air CO 2 uptake of − 0. 37 ± 0. 06 PgC yr − 1 is consistent with the − 0. 24 ± 0. 12 PgC yr− 1 calculated from observations. The fluxes from the southern Indian Ocean (18 – 44 ° S; − 0. 43 ± 0. 07 PgC yr− 1 are similar in magnitude to the annual uptake for the entire Indian Ocean. All models capture the observed pattern of fluxes in the Indian Ocean with the following exceptions: underestimation of upwelling fluxes in the northwestern region (off Oman and Somalia), overestimation in the northeastern region (Bay of Bengal) and underestimation of the CO 2 sink in the subtropical convergence zone. These differences were mainly driven by lack of atmospheric CO 2 data in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>inversions,</b> and poor simulation of monsoonal currents and freshwater discharge in ocean biogeochemical models. Overall, the models and inversions do capture the phase of the observed seasonality for the entire Indian Ocean but overestimate the magnitude. The predicted sea–air CO 2 fluxes by ocean biogeochemical models (OBGMs) respond to seasonal variability with strong phase lags with reference to climatological CO 2 flux, whereas the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>inversions</b> predicted an order of magnitude higher seasonal flux than OBGMs. The simulated interannual variability by the OBGMs is weaker than that found by <b>atmospheric</b> <b>inversions.</b> Prediction of such weak interannual variability in CO 2 fluxes by <b>atmospheric</b> <b>inversions</b> was mainly caused by a lack of atmospheric data in the Indian Ocean.

Fluxes inferred from <b>atmospheric</b> <b>inversions</b> have large variability, whereas those simulated by ocean models have small variability. Part of {{the difference is that}} unlike typical <b>atmospheric</b> <b>inversions,</b> ocean models come with spatial resolution at the sub-basin scale. Here we explore sub-basin-scale spatiotemporal variability in the North Atlantic in one ocean model in order to better understand why the the North Atlantic basin may well contribute very little to the global variability of air-sea CO 2 flux. We made two simulations with a biogeochemical model coupled to a global ocean general circulation model (OGCM), which itself was forced by 55 -year NCEP reanalysis fields. In the first simulation, atmospheric CO 2 was maintained at the preindustrial level (278 ppmv); in the second simulation, atmospheric CO 2 followed the observed increase. Simulated air-sea CO 2 fluxes and associated variables were analysed with a statistical tool known as multichannel singular spectrum analysis (MSSA). We found that the subtropical gyre is not the largest contributor to the overall, basin-wide variability, in contrast to previous suggestions. The subpolar gyre and the inter-gyre region (the transition area between subpolar and subtropical gyres) also contribute with multipolar anomalies at multiple frequencies: these tend to cancel one another in terms of the basin-wide air-sea CO 2 flux. We found a strong correlation between the air-sea CO 2 fluxes and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), but only if one takes into account time lags as does MSSA (maximum r = 0. 64 for lags between 1 and 3 years).

Seven out of the nine models suggest that CO 2 fertilization is the strongest control - with the notable exception of VEGAS, which attributes approximately equally to the three factors. Generally, all models display an enhanced seasonality over the boreal region in response to high-latitude warming, but a negative climate contribution from part of the Northern Hemisphere temperate region, and the net result is a divergence over climate change effect. Six of the nine models show that land use/cover change amplifies the seasonal cycle of global FTA: some are due to forest regrowth, while others are caused by crop expansion or agricultural intensification, as revealed by their divergent spatial patterns. We also discovered a moderate cross-model correlation between FTA amplitude increase and increase in land carbon sink (R 2 Combining double low line g 0. 61).

It is {{important}} to improve estimates of large-scale carbon fluxes over the boreal forest because the responses of this biome to global change may influence the dynamics of atmospheric carbon dioxide in ways that may influence the magnitude of climate change.

The analysis indicates that the TBMs are modeling the spring uptake of CO 2 too early, and that the inversion shows large uncertainty and more dependence on the initial conditions over Europe and Boreal Asia than Boreal North America. This uncertainty is related to the scarcity of data over the continents, and as this problem {{is not likely to be}} solved in the near future, TBMs will need to be developed and improved, as they are likely the best option for understanding the impact of climate variability in these regions. 1...|$|R

It is also shown that the benefit to include the correlations between on-line and off-line state variables is case dependent...|$|R
40|$|Natural methane (CH 4) {{emissions}} from wet ecosystems {{are an important}} part of today's global CH 4 budget. Climate affects the exchange of CH 4 between ecosystems and the atmosphere by influencing CH 4 production, oxidation, and transport in the soil. The net CH 4 exchange depends on ecosystem hydrology, soil and vegetation characteristics. Here, the LPJ-WHyMe global dynamical vegetation model is used to simulate global net CH 4 emissions for different ecosystems: northern peatlands (45 °– 90 ° N), naturally inundated wetlands (60 ° S– 45 ° N), rice agriculture and wet mineral soils. Mineral soils are a potential CH 4 sink, but can also be a source with the direction of the net exchange depending on soil moisture content. The geographical and seasonal distributions are evaluated against multi-dimensional <b>atmospheric</b> <b>inversions</b> for 2003 – 2005, using two independent four-dimensional variational assimilation systems. The <b>atmospheric</b> <b>inversions</b> are constrained by the atmospheric CH 4 observations of the SCIAMACHY satellite instrument and global surface networks. Compared to LPJ-WHyMe the inversions result in a~significant reduction in the {{emissions from}} northern peatlands and suggest that LPJ-WHyMe maximum annual emissions peak about one month late. The inversions do not put strong constraints on the division of sources between inundated wetlands and wet mineral soils in the tropics. Based on the inversion results we diagnose model parameters in LPJ-WHyMe and simulate the surface exchange of CH 4 over the period 1990 – 2008. Over the whole period we infer an increase of global ecosystem CH 4 emissions of + 1. 11 Tg CH 4 yr− 1, not considering potential additional changes in wetland extent. The increase in simulated CH 4 emissions is attributed to enhanced soil respiration resulting from the observed rise in land temperature and in atmospheric carbon dioxide that were used as input. The long-term decline of the atmospheric CH 4 growth rate from 1990 to 2006 cannot be fully explained with the simulated ecosystem emissions. However, these emissions show an increasing trend of + 3. 62 Tg CH 4 yr− 1 over 2005 – 2008 which can partly explain the renewed increase in atmospheric CH 4 concentration during recent years...|$|R
