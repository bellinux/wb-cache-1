50|$|An <b>amorphic</b> <b>allele</b> is {{commonly}} recessive to its wildtype counterpart. It {{is possible for}} an amorph to be dominant if the gene in question is required in two copies to elicit a normal phenotype (i.e. haploinsufficient).|$|E
50|$|A mutant allele that {{produces}} no protein {{is called a}} protein null (shown by western analysis), and one {{that produces}} no RNA is called an RNA null (shown by Northern analysis or by DNA sequencing of a deletion allele). A genetic null or <b>amorphic</b> <b>allele</b> has the same phenotype when homozygous as when heterozygous with a deficiency that disrupts the locus in question. A genetic null allele can be a protein and RNA null, but can also express normal levels of a gene product that is non-functional due to mutation.|$|E
40|$|Modulation of {{reactive}} {{oxygen species}} (ROS) {{plays a key role}} in signal transduction pathways. Selenoproteins act controlling the redox balance of the cell. We have studied how the alteration of the redox balance caused by patufet (selD(ptuf)), a null mutation in the Drosophila melanogaster selenophosphate synthetase 1 (sps 1) gene, which codes for the SelD enzyme of the selenoprotein biosynthesis, affects the Ras/MAPK signalling pathway. The selD(ptuf) mutation dominantly suppresses the phenotypes in the eye and the wing caused by hyperactivation of the Ras/MAPK cassette and the activated forms of the Drosophila EGF receptor (DER) and Sevenless (Sev) receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which signal in the eye and wing, respectively. No dominant interaction is observed with sensitized conditions in the Wnt, Notch, Insulin-Pi 3 K, and DPP signalling pathways. Our current hypothesis is that selenoproteins selectively modulate the Ras/MAPK signalling pathway through their antioxidant function. This is further supported by the fact that a selenoprotein-independent increase in ROS caused by the catalase <b>amorphic</b> Cat(n 1) <b>allele</b> also reduces Ras/MAPK signalling. Here, we present the first evidence for the role of intracellular redox environment in signalling pathways in Drosophila as a whole organism...|$|R
40|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) cause {{oxidative}} stress and aging. The catalase gene {{is a key}} component of the cellular antioxidant defense network. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate catalase gene expression are poorly understood. In this study, we have identi®ed a DNA replication-related element (DRE; 5 ¢-TATCGATA) in the 5 ¢-¯anking region of the Drosophila catalase gene. Gel mobility shift assays revealed that a previously identi®ed factor called DREF (DREbinding factor) binds to the DRE sequence in the Drosophila catalase gene. We used site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro transient transfection assays to establish that expression of the catalase gene is regulated by DREF through the DRE site. To explore the role of DRE/DREF in vivo, we established transgenic ¯ies carrying a catalase±lacZ fusion gene with or without mutation in the DRE. The b-galactosidase expression patterns of these reporter transgenic lines demonstrated that the catalase gene is upregulated by DREF through the DRE sequence. In addition, we observed suppression of the ectopic DREF-induced rough eye phenotype by a catalase <b>amorphic</b> Catn 1 <b>allele,</b> indicating that DREF activity is modulated by the intracellular redox state. These results indicate that the DRE/ DREF system is a key regulator of catalase gene expression and provide evidence of cross-talk between the DRE/DREF system and the antioxidant defense system...|$|R

We have {{transformed}} Drosophila melanogaster with a genomic construct containing the entire wild-type myosin heavy-chain gene, Mhc, together with • 9 kb of flanking DNA on each side. Three independent lines stably express myosin heavy-chain protein (MHC) at approximately wild-type levels.

The MHC produced is functional since it rescues the mutant phenotypes {{of a number}} of different Mhc alleles: the <b>amorphic</b> <b>allele</b> Mhc 1, the indirect flight muscle and jump muscle-specific <b>amorphic</b> <b>allele</b> Mhc 10, and the hypomorphic allele Mhc 2. We show that the Mhc 2 mutation is due to the insertion of a transposable element in an intron of Mhc. Since a reduction in MHC in the indirect flight muscles alters the myosin/actin protein ratio and results in myofibrillar defects, we determined the effects of an increase in the effective copy number of Mhc. The presence of four copies of Mhc results in overabundance of the protein and a flightless phenotype. Electron microscopy reveals concomitant defects in the indirect flight muscles, with excess thick filaments at the periphery of the myofibrils. Further increases in copy number are lethal. These results demonstrate the usefulness and potential of the transgenic system to study myosin function in Drosophila. They also show that overexpression of wild-type protein in muscle may disrupt the function of not only the indirect flight but also other muscles of the organism...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{variation}} {{affecting the}} expressivity of an <b>amorphic</b> <b>allele</b> of the homeotic gene Ultrabithorax, (Ubx(1)) was characterized after 11 generations of introgression into 29 different isofemale lines. Heterozygotes display {{a range of}} haploinsufficient phenotypes, from overlap with wild-type halteres to dramatic transformations such as a 50 % increase in area {{and the presence of}} over 20 bristles on the anterior margin of each haltere. In both the wild-type and mutant genetic backgrounds, there is moderate genetic variance and low environmental variance/developmental asymmetry, as expected of a trait under stabilizing selection pressure. Surprisingly, {{there is little evidence that}} mutant halteres are more variable than wild-type ones, so it is unclear that haltere development is also canalized. The correlation between wild-type and Ubx haltere size is very low, indicating that interactions among modifiers of Ubx are complex, and in some cases sex-specific. The potential quantitative genetic contributions of homeotic genes to appendage morphology are discussed, noting that population-level effects of variation in key regulatory genes may be prevalent and complex but cannot be readily extrapolated to macroevolutionary diversification...|$|E
40|$|The RpII 215 locus encodes {{the large}} subunit of RNA {{polymerase}} II (polII). Three of 22 RpII 215 alleles cause a synergistic enhancement of the mutant phenotype elicited by mutations in the Ultrabithorax (Ubx) locus. We have recovered and analyzed three new mutations that suppress this enhancement. All three mutations {{map to the}} RpII 215 locus. In addition to suppressing the Ubx enhancement of other RpII 215 alleles, two of the new mutations, JH 1 and WJK 2, themselves enhance Ubx. RpII 215 alleles can be placed into three classes based {{on their ability to}} enhance Ubx. Class I alleles, including Ubl, C 4, C 11, JH 1, and WJK 2, enhance Ubx when heterozygous with class II alleles, which include wild-type RpII 215. Class III alleles, which include amorphic alleles, do not enhance Ubx. The third new mutation, WJK 1, is a conditional <b>amorphic</b> <b>allele,</b> which behaves like a class III allele at 29 ° but like a class II allele at 19 °. Another mutant phenotype is caused by certain RpII 215 alleles, including all class I alleles. This phenotype is a synergistic enhancement of a mutant phenotype elicited by mutations at the Delta (Dl) locus. Unlike the enhancement of Ubx, the enhancement of Dl is not dependent upon antagonistic interactions between different classes of RpII 215 alleles...|$|E
40|$|Background: Rho 1 {{is a small}} GTPase of the Ras {{superfamily}} {{that serves}} as the central component in a highly conserved signaling pathway that regulates tissue morphogenesis during development in all animals. Since there is tremendous diversity in the upstream signals that can activate Rho 1 as well as the effector molecules that carry out its functions, it is important to define relevant Rho 1 -interacting genes for each morphogenetic event regulated by this signaling pathway. Previous work from our lab and others has shown that Rho signaling is necessary for the morphogenesis of leg imaginal discs during metamorphosis in Drosophila, although a comprehensive identification of Rho 1 -interacting genes has not been attempted for this process. Methodology/Principal Findings: We characterized an <b>amorphic</b> <b>allele</b> of Rho 1 that displays a poorly penetrant dominant malformed leg phenotype and is capable of being strongly enhanced by Rho 1 -interacting heterozygous mutations. We then used this allele in a second-site noncomplementation screen with the Exelixis collection of molecularly defined deficiencies to identify Rho 1 -interacting genes necessary for leg morphogenesis. In a primary screen of 461 deficiencies collectively uncovering, 50 % of the Drosophila genome, we identified twelve intervals harboring Rho 1 -interacting genes. Through secondary screening we identified six Rho 1 -interacting genes including three that were previously identified (RhoGEF 2, broad, and stubbloid), thereby validating the screen. In addition, we identified Cdc 42, Rheb and Sc 2 as novel Rho 1 -interactin...|$|E
40|$|The l(1) TW- 6 (cs) {{mutation}} is a cold-sensitive recessive {{lethal mutation}} in Drosophila melanogaster, that affects both meiotic and mitotic chromosome segregation. We report {{the isolation of}} three revertants of this mutation. All three revert both the meiotic and mitotic effects {{as well as the}} cold sensitivity, demonstrating that all three phenotypes are due to a single lesion. We further show that these revertants fail to complement an <b>amorphic</b> <b>allele</b> of the nod (no distributive disjunction) locus, which encodes a kinesin-like protein. These experiments demonstrate that l(1) TW- 6 (cs) is an antimorphic allele of nod, and we rename it nod(DTW). Sequencing of the nod locus on a nod(DTW) -bearing chromosome reveals a single base change in the putative ATP-binding region of the motor domain of nod. Recessive, loss-of-function mutations at the nod locus specifically disrupt the segregation of nonexchange chromosomes in female meiosis. We demonstrate that, at 23. 5 °, the meiotic defects in nod(DTW) /+ females are similar to those observed in nod/nod females; that is, the segregation of nonexchange chromosomes is abnormal. However, in nod(DTW) /nod(DTW) females, or in nod(DTW) /+ females at 18 °, we observe a more severe meiotic defect that apparently affects the segregation of both exchange and nonexchange chromosomes. In addition, nod(DTW) homozygotes and hemizygous males have previously been shown to exhibit mitotic defects including somatic chromosome breakage and loss. We propose that the defective protein encoded by the nod(DTW) allele interferes with proper chromosome movement during both meiosis and mitosis, perhaps by binding irreversibly to microtubules...|$|E
