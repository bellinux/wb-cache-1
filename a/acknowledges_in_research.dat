40|$|The role of cognitions {{has been}} widely <b>acknowledged</b> <b>in</b> <b>research,</b> where {{distorted}} thinking is recognized as {{an important factor in}} both the initiation and maintenance of child sexual abuse. More recently, there has been an emergence of data-driven descriptive accounts based on interviews and analysis of texts formed by the child abuser. Researchers currently suggest that sexual offenders' cognitive distortions emerge from underlying causal theories about the nature of themselves, their victims, and the world, where the focus is on identifying the cognitive processes involved in preference to the content of notionally unrelated independent beliefs held by these individuals. The aim of this review is to examine the nature of these cognitive distortions in child sex offenders by analyzing the core constructs of Finkelhor's Precondition Model in comparison to the more recent implicit theories perspective and Pathways model outlined by Ward and colleagues.

40|$|Men's {{intersecting}} identities as {{fathers and}} as perpetrators {{of domestic violence}} are increasingly <b>acknowledged</b> <b>in</b> <b>research</b> and practice and children's social services are referring such men to perpetrator programmes. This paper draws on the evaluation of a newly established voluntary programme for male perpetrators of domestic violence in north-east England to consider how men's involvement with children's social services and fathering roles shaped motivation to engage with a process of change. The evaluation drew on project throughput data and background information on programme participants as well as interviews undertaken with men and their partners. Men who were currently involved with children's social services {{were found to be}} more likely than other programme participants to engage with the programme for more than five sessions. The desire to secure or regain access to their children or to avoid care proceedings was an extrinsic form of motivation that appeared effective in securing men's initial engagement with the programme. However, children could also function as a form of intrinsic motivation with men developing their awareness of the impact of abusive behaviour on children and viewing their participation in the programme as a means of becoming a ‘better father’...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores a futures {{perspective}} for practical theology. Although {{there are some}} examples of a future orientation, a systematic futures perspective has not been developed. Building on futures studies (including predictive studies on foresight and design and architecture studies), the authors propose a methodological model for future-sensitive practical theology, accounting for the probable, possible, and preferable. The model results in three modes in which practical theology can employ a future orientation: utopian, prognostic-adaptive, and designing-creative. 1. INTROUCTION Practical theology is a future-oriented discipline, but this dimension of its character and practice is not always <b>acknowledged</b> <b>in</b> <b>research</b> endeavours. That is the claim we make in this paper. We set out to unpack {{the first half of}} the claim in describing the orientation on the future. Then we will elaborate on the methodological implications by building on the disciplines of futures studies and design/architecture. The motivational argument for arranging this conversation could be found in the strategic nature and character these disciplines have in common with practical theology. Translating notions of this interdisciplinary exchange into the language of practical theology, we finally discuss the challenges an...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{co-occurrence of}} {{substance}} abuse and excessive sexual activities is <b>acknowledged</b> <b>in</b> <b>research</b> and treatment practice. Men seem particularly at risk for developing excessive sexual activities. Excessive sexual activities complicate substance abuse treatment, and clients with such co-occurring difficulties have considerable treatment needs. It is therefore considered important to investigate how male clients who had enacted excessive sexual activities, perceive their excessive sexual activities, and themselves. Design: Interviews were performed with five male clients in substance abuse treatment, who had enacted excessive sexual activities. The interviews concerned the participants’ perception of themselves and how they came to enact excessive sexual activities. The interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Two major themes were identified. One theme concerned overwhelming shame and difficulties to discuss sexuality in treatment. The second theme concerned how perceptions about masculinity had influenced sexual activities. Sexuality was described as an absent topic in their previous and ongoing treatment, and the participants described a need to discuss sexuality. Implications: It seems important that future studies investigate how excessive sexual activities might be identified and handled in treatment. It also seems important to investigate how gender-perceptions might influence excessive sexual activities. As a suggestion, practitioners should address sexuality, shame and perceptions about gender during treatment.

40|$|Background: Insight {{and illness}} {{perception}} are two concepts {{of interest in}} the study of factors related to clinical outcome in patients with psychosis. Insight implies a risk of emotional distress for the patient. Illness perceptions, regardless of their accuracy, might be favorable or not to illness. Literature provides evidence of significant correlates of these factors with clinical outcome, but they are rarely included in a single study. Objectives: 1) assessing insight and illness perception in a sample of Mexican patients who have experienced psychosis and, 2) analyzing how insight and illness perception relate to each other and how they relate to clinical status (i. e., positive, negative, and general psychopathology, depression, and anxiety). Methods: Sixty-one participants (55. 7 % females) were recruited from a public psychiatric hospital; insight and illness perceptions were assessed with the SUMD and the Brief-IPQ, respectively. Clinical status was assessed with the PANSS, CDS and BAI scales. Results: Participants showed good insight, favorable illness perceptions for the cognitive and comprehension dimensions, but unfavorable for the emotional dimension. Clinical status of sample was characterized by mild symptoms. Poor insight related to positive symptoms and general psychopathology. Cognitive and emotional perceptions of illness were significantly associated to most clinical status parameters, whereas comprehension showed no significant results. Conclusions: The study not only replicates the significant association on insight and illness perception with clinical outcome, but shows how their patterns of interactions are different, reinforcing the idea that they are two distinct factors worthy of being habitually <b>acknowledged</b> <b>in</b> <b>research</b> and clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{popularity}} of social information systems {{has been driven}} by their ability to help users manage, organize and share online resources. Though the research exploring the use of tags is relatively new, two things are widely <b>acknowledged</b> <b>in</b> the <b>research</b> community: (a) tags act as a medium for social collaboration, navigation and browsing and (b) an overall stable equilibrium exists among tag patterns due to the social nature of the tagging process. But there is very little agreement on what causes these stable patterns. In this paper, we take an evolutionary perspective to understand the process of tagging to investigate whether tags act as "way finders " or digital pheromones in social tagging systems. We investigate the existence of tag trails based on a semantic similarity measure among existing tags. We found that over 50 % of the resources we evaluated exhibited strong trail patterns. The implications of these patterns for the design and management of social tagging systems is discussed...|$|R

In this paper, a distribution uncertainty is defined, and then an upper expectation regression is proposed, which can describe the relationship between extreme events and relevant covariates under the framework of distribution uncertainty. As there are no classical methods available to estimate the parameters in the upper expectation regression, a two-step penalized maximum least squares procedure is proposed to estimate the mean function and the upper expectation of the error. The resulting estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal in a certain sense. Simulation studies and a real data example are conducted to show that the classical least squares estimation does not work and the penalized maximum least squares performs well...|$|R

EvalBench reduces implementation effort for evaluation features and makes conducting user studies easier.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{presents}} {{a conceptual framework}} for addressing temporal variation in natural risk. Numerous former natural risk analyses and investigations have demonstrated that time and related changes have a crucial influence on risk. For natural hazards, time becomes a factor {{for a number of}} reasons. Using the example of landslides to illustrate this point, it is shown that: 1. landslide history is important in determining probability of occurrence, 2. the significance of catchment variables in explaining landslide susceptibility is dependent on the time scale chosen, 3. the observer's perception of the geosystem's state changes with different time spans, and 4. the system's sensitivity varies with time. Natural hazards are not isolated events but complex features that are connected with the social system. Similarly, elements at risk and their vulnerability are highly dynamic through time, an aspect that is not sufficiently <b>acknowledged</b> <b>in</b> <b>research.</b> Since natural risk is an amalgam of hazard and vulnerability, its temporal behaviour has to be considered as well. Identifying these changes and their underlying processes contributes {{to a better understanding of}} natural risk today and in the future. However, no dynamic models for natural risks are currently available. Dynamic behaviour of factors affecting risk is likely to create increasing connectivity and complexity. This demands a broad approach to natural risk, since the concept of risk encapsulates aspects of many disciplines and has suffered from single-discipline approaches in the past. In New Zealand, dramatic environmental and social change has occurred in a relatively short period of time, graphically demonstrating the temporal variability of the geosystem and the social system. To understand these changes and subsequent interactions between both systems, a holistic perspective is needed. This contribution reviews available frameworks, demonstrates the need for further concepts, and gives research perspectives on a New Zealand example...|$|R
