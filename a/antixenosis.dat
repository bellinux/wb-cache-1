25|$|Among rice cultivars, {{there are}} {{differences}} in the responses to, and recovery from, pest damage. Many rice varieties have been selected for resistance to insect pests. Therefore, particular cultivars are recommended for areas prone to certain pest problems. The genetically based ability of a rice variety to withstand pest attacks is called resistance. Three main types of plant resistance to pests are recognized as nonpreference, antibiosis, and tolerance. Nonpreference (or <b>antixenosis)</b> describes host plants which insects prefer to avoid; antibiosis is where insect survival is reduced after the ingestion of host tissue; and tolerance is the capacity of a plant to produce high yield or retain high quality despite insect infestation.|$|E
50|$|Several {{varieties}} of soybean have demonstrated {{resistance to the}} soybean aphid. Resistance may be conferred by antibiosis, <b>antixenosis,</b> or tolerance. In some instances, such as with the soybean cultivars 'Dowling', 'Jackson', and 'Palmetto', resistance to the soybean aphid results {{from a combination of}} both antibiosis and <b>antixenosis.</b> In the 'Dowling' cultivar, resistance is conferred by a single dominant gene (Rag1). Soybean plants that are resistant to the soybean aphid can cause both reduced fecundity and longevity in soybean aphids. In the case of antibiosis, certain life stages of the soybean aphid may be more susceptible than others. For example, nymphs have higher rates of metabolism than other life stages, ingest more phloem, and are thus exposed to larger quantities of antibiotic compounds. Expression of antibiotic factors in resistant soybean plants that negatively affect soybean aphids has been shown to remain constant throughout the growing season, remaining unaffected by the physiological maturity of the plant. Colonization of resistant soybean cultivars can vary between years depending upon the level of infestation, with resistant plants showing lower levels of resistance in years with significant levels of soybean aphid infestation. Physical characteristics of soybean, such as dense pubescence, have thus far proven incapable of reducing colonization by soybean aphids.|$|E
50|$|Damage to {{the plant}} {{is caused by the}} larvae that, upon hatching, feed on the leaves for almost the {{entirety}} of their developmental cycle. This can be so damaging, that up to 100% of the entire crop can be lost. One method of decreasing this damage is by the use of pesticides. These, however can be detrimental to human health as well as the environment. Another method that is being explored is the use of host plant resistance, which is safer and more sustainable. Resistant crops are becoming increasingly popular as pesticides have quite a few drawbacks. Resistance can be seen as <b>antixenosis,</b> tolerance and antibiosis.|$|E

40|$|One {{hundred and}} thirty-eight rice accessions were {{screened}} for {{resistance to the}} small brown planthopper (SBPH) (Laodelphax striatellus Fallén) by the modified seedbox screening test. Twenty-five rice accessions with different levels of resistance to SBPH were detected, accounting for 18. 1 % of the total accessions, which included 2 highly resistant, 9 resistant and 14 moderately resistant varieties. Compared with indica rice, japonica rice was more susceptible to SBPH. <b>Antixenosis</b> test, antibiosis test and correlation analysis were performed to elucidate the resistance mechanism. The resistant check Rathu Heenati (RHT), highly resistant varieties Mudgo and Kasalath, and resistant variety IR 36 expressed strong <b>antixenosis</b> and antibiosis against SBPH, indicating the close relationship between resistance level and these two resistance mechanisms in the four rice varieties. Antibiosis was the dominant resistance pattern in the resistant varieties Daorenqiao and Yangmaogu due to their high antibiosis but low <b>antixenosis.</b> Dular, ASD 7 and Milyang 23 had relatively strong <b>antixenosis</b> and antibiosis, indicating the two resistance mechanisms were significant in these three varieties. The resistant DV 85 expressed relatively high level of <b>antixenosis</b> but low antibiosis, whereas Zhaiyeqing 8 and Guiyigu conferred only moderate antibiosis and <b>antixenosis</b> to SBPH, suggesting tolerance in these three varieties. Antibiosis and <b>antixenosis</b> governed the resistance to SBPH in the moderately resistant accession 9311. <b>Antixenosis</b> was the main resistance type in V 20 A.

Thrips-resistant cabbage varieties have been developed in breeding programs, but the mechanisms of resistance remain largely unknown. <b>Antixenosis,</b> {{one of the three}} resistance mechanisms, may play a role but no plant trait has been identified as a source of <b>antixenosis.</b> A series of studies were conducted to identify resistance mechanisms in this insect-crop interaction and to seek plant traits that were correlated to resistance. In this first article of the series, the result of studying <b>antixenosis</b> and overall resistance of cabbage and the correlation between <b>antixenosis</b> and light reflectance characteristics are reported.

Varieties also differed in their level of antixenosis; proportional abundance of thrips adults on head-forming leaves was more closely correlated to overall resistance of cabbage than actual thrips numbers. Some of the variables computed from the recorded reflectance spectra of cabbage were correlated to thrips abundance on head-forming leaves only in the first but not in the second year of this study, suggesting that either spectral characteristics do not affect <b>antixenosis</b> or other variables may affect thrips' responses to spectral cues.

40|$|Visual stimuli {{influence}} the orientation behaviour of the sorghum midge, Contarinia sorghicola Coq. (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae). Yellow, {{red and white}} colours are attractive to the midge while blue and black are least attractive. Sorghum panicles covered with blue- or black-coloured bags in a headcage showed maximum midge damage, while the reverse was true for panicles covered with yellow, red, and white coloured bags. Panicles at half-anthesis with viable pollen and receptive stigmata suffered higher damage than those at the pre- and post-anthesis. Physical removal of anthers and stigmata significantly reduced the oviposition by the sorghum midge. Reduced oviposition/adult emergence was also recorded in male sterile sorghum lines (221 9 A and 296 A) or through chemically- (EthreP) (2 -Chloro ethyl-phosphonic acid) induced male sterility in panicles of the sorghum cultivar, Swarna. Chemical stimuli from viable pollen and receptive stigmata and to a limited extent physical stimuli, govern the oviposition behaviour of the sorghum midge. Sorghum cultivars IS 12573 C, S-GIRL-MR 1 and IS 2816 C showed <b>antixenosis</b> to adult midges. However, these cultivars became susceptible under no-choice conditions in the headcage.

In a greenhouse artificial infestation study, we compared the establishment of larvae on potted plants. In laboratory choice and no-choice experiments, we studied the establishment of larvae on plant organs (stalk, sheath, leaf spindle). Study of the feeding behaviour showed that: (1) first to fourth instars are able to feed on stalk, sheath, and leaf spindle, (2) boring into the stalk occurs mostly in the four uppermost internodes, and (3) most young larvae bore through the abaxial surface of leaf sheaths to reach the stalk.

40|$|Emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), is an {{invasive}} {{forest pest}} causing widespread mortality of ash (Fraxinus spp.) in North America. Host resistance {{research and the}} development of resistant hosts offers a promising strategy for the long-term conservation of ash and management of EAB. Manchurian ash (F. mandshurica) shares an evolutionary history with EAB in Asia, resulting in its greater resistance relative to naive North American ashes. In the following studies I investigate <b>antixenosis</b> and antibiosis mechanisms of resistant and susceptible ashes. <b>Antixenosis</b> in Manchurian ash was demonstrated by quantifying substantially lower oviposition on this species relative to North American ashes. The potential underlying mechanisms of <b>antixenosis</b> were addressed by profiling the bark and canopy volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by susceptible black (F. nigra) and resistant Manchurian ashes and major species differences in VOC profiles were demonstrated. 	To address antibiosis, the physiological responses of EAB larvae that had fed on Manchurian, white (F. americana), and green (F. pennsylvanica) ash were quantified. It was found that antioxidant and quinone-protective enzyme activities of larvae feeding on Manchurian ash were substantially higher, suggesting that larvae feeding on Manchurian ash experience relatively high levels of reactive oxygen species and quinone stress. Manchurian ash demonstrated substantially higher activities of defense-associated enzymes and reactions than black ash, especially phenolic-oxidizing enzymes. These results support the conclusions of the larval physiology study that Manchurian ash appears to be able to generates greater amounts of quinone- and ROS-stress in vivo than North American ashes. Lastly, larval performance and bark phenolic chemistry and physiology were compared for Manchurian ash that were experimentally girdled or not. Girdling reduced larval performance by half but bark defenses did not differ by treatment indicating that decreases in larval performance are associated with factors other than a reduction in levels of host defenses. 	It was concluded that Manchurian ash expresses <b>antixenosis,</b> which may be driven by the emission of certain volatiles. Also, that antibiosis appears {{to be related to the}} ability of Manchurian ash to generate an oxidatively stressful diet for larvae and larval success in compromised trees does not stem from a reduction in defense levels...|$|E
30|$|The {{tolerance}} {{mechanism of}} the resistance results showed the {{significant difference in the}} tolerance level among the different BPH resistant lines (CR 2711 – 76, PTB- 33 and Rathu Heenati) and cultivar CR 2711 – 76 with the BPH 31 gene has exhibited a high level of tolerance mechanism (Fig. 2 d). This study explains that CR 2711 – 76 has a broad-spectrum of resistance with antibiosis, <b>antixenosis,</b> and tolerance mechanisms to different BPH populations of the Philippines and BPH biotype 4 of India. It has been well understood that those varieties or cultivars that possess all three kinds of mechanisms of resistance often show broad-spectrum and stable resistance {{for a long period of}} time (Panda and Heinrichs 1983). If the antibiosis and <b>antixenosis</b> mechanisms of resistance genes are overcome by the insect, the tolerance mechanism can work as a second line of defense that may continue to function (Mackenzie 1980). In support, the bioassay results from 2009 to 2014 in India and 2013 – 2015 in the Philippines (~ 7  years) proved that, CR 2711 – 76 is stable resistant cultivar (Additional file 9 : Figure S 9 and Table 1). Hence, CR 2711 – 76 can be considered as a new donor for broad-spectrum resistance to different BPH populations of the Philippines such as Laguna, Isabela, Bicol, and Neuva Ecijia which belongs to three different BPH biotypes, biotype 1, 2 and 3 (Saxena and Barrion 1985) and Indian biotype 4.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the density of trichomes and hydrocarbons associated with the resistance by <b>antixenosis</b> of 42 subsamples of tomato plants from the Horticultural Germplasm Bank of the Universidade Federal de Viçosa (HGB-UFV) to Liriomyza trifolii. These subsamples were studied in addition to 'Santa Clara' cultivar, which {{was used as a}} standard of susceptibility to leafminers. The evaluated characteristics were the number of mined leaflets per plant, mines per plant, trichome density and chemical compounds in the leaves. Differences were detected among the subsamples in the variables studied. We identified 20 peaks in the chromatograms of leaf hexane extract the subsamples tested. The subsamples HGBs - 216, 813, 985, 987, 991, 992, 993, 1532, 1989, 1991, 2048, 2055, 2064, 2068, 2073, 2075, 2089, 2096 and 2097 were selected as sources of resistance to L. trifolii. The resistance mechanism associated to these subsamples was <b>antixenosis.</b> In addition, the low density of trichomes and the chemical compounds in the subsamples can be possible causes of pest resistance...|$|E
40|$|The noctuid pod borer, Helicoverpa armigera, {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pests of pigeonpea, and plant resistance is an important component for minimizing the extent of losses caused by this pest. To develop insect-resistant cultivars, it is important to understand the contributions of different components of resistance, and therefore, we studied the <b>antixenosis</b> mechanism of resistance to H. armigera in a diverse array of pigeonpea genotypes under no-choice, dual-choice, and multi-choice conditions. <b>Antixenosis</b> for oviposition was observed in case of ICPL 187 - 1, ICP 7203 - 1, ICPL 88039, T 21, ICPL 84060, and ICPL 332 under no-choice, dual-choice and multi-choice conditions. However, the number of eggs laid on ICPL 88039, T 21 and ICP 7203 - 1 did not differ significantly from those on ICPL 87 under dual-choice conditions. The susceptible check, ICPL 87 was highly preferred for oviposition. The genotypes ICP 7203 - 1, ICPL 187 - 1, T 21, ICPL 332, and ICPL 84060 can be used as sources of non-preference mechanism of resistance in pigeonpea improvement programs to breed for resistance to H. armigera...|$|E
30|$|IR 64 has {{relatively}} durable {{resistance to}} BPH, {{and it is}} known to carry the major gene Bph 1. However, it {{is reported to have}} better resistance than other varieties carrying Bph 1 and has good field resistance to the pest, exhibiting antiobiosis, <b>antixenosis</b> and tolerance (Cohen et al. 1997). This is partly attributed to its possessing additional QTLs controlling BPH resistance which confer greater durability of the resistance (Alam and Cohen 1998).|$|E
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comSix cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) varieties with different levels of resistance to Mamestra brassicae (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) were investigated {{in order to assess}} whether antibiosis and <b>antixenosis</b> mechanisms are involved in the resistance to this pest or not. Four experiments were conducted to determine the effect of variety and plant ontogeny on larval behaviour, adult oviposition and leaf damages in non-choice and choice tests. Larval survival, time to development and larval weights differed depending on the varieties and plant stages that we tested. At the pre-head stage, larval mortality was higher, larvae died faster, time to pupation was shorter, pupae were lighter and the percentage of viable pupae and growth index (GI) values were lower than larvae reared from plants at the head stage. The commercial hybrid ‘Corazón de buey’ and the local variety named ‘BRS 0535 ’ exhibited antibiosis to M. brassicae as they reduced its survival and growth and delayed its development time. In addition, these varieties were the most resistant after artificial infestation in terms of head foliage consumption and number of larvae per plant. Oviposition tests demonstrated that resistance found in ‘Corazón de buey’ and BRS 0535 could be also based on <b>antixenosis</b> mechanisms as they resulted in fewer egg batches on plants, whereas BRS 0402 could be classified as resistant because M. brassicae larvae showed less preference for it. Thus, resistance to M. brassicae found in cabbage crops {{may be due to the}} joint action of several factors involving antibiosis and <b>antixenosis.</b> We found significant differences in the resistance of BRS 0535 depending on the plant ontogeny as it loses its resistance while developing. Further studies are required to identify the mechanism of antibiotic resistance which is present in this variety at the pre-head stage and the changes that occur in plant defence as it grows.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate bean genotypes for resistance to soybean looper (Chrysodeixis includens). Initially, free-choice tests were carried out with 59 genotypes, divided into three groups according to leaf color intensity (dark green, light green, and medium green), in order to evaluate oviposition preference. Subsequently, 12 genotypes with high potential for resistance were selected, {{as well as two}} susceptible commercial standards. With these genotypes, new tests were performed for oviposition in a greenhouse, besides tests for attractiveness and consumption under laboratory conditions (26 &# 177; 2 &# 186;C, 65 &# 177; 10 % RH, and 14 h light: 10 h dark photophase). In the no-choice test with adults, in the greenhouse, the 'IAC Jabola', Arcelina 1, 'IAC Boreal', 'Flor de Mayo', and 'IAC Formoso' genotypes were the least oviposited, showing antixenosis-type resistance for oviposition. In the free-choice test with larvae, Arcelina 4, 'BRS Horizonte', 'P&# 233;rola', H 96 A 102 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 52, 'IAC Boreal', 'IAC Harmonia', and 'IAC Formoso' were the less consumed genotypes, which indicates <b>antixenosis</b> to feeding. In the no-choice test, all genotypes (except for 'IAPAR 57 ') expressed moderate levels of <b>antixenosis</b> to feeding against C. includens larvae...|$|E
