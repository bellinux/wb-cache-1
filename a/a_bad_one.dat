5|$|The {{choice of}} de Castries {{as the local}} {{commander}} at Điện Biên Phủ was, in retrospect, <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>one.</b> Navarre had picked de Castries, a cavalryman in the 18th-century tradition, because Navarre envisioned Điện Biên Phủ as a mobile battle. Điện Biên Phủ required someone adept at World War I-style trench warfare, something for which de Castries was not suited.|$|E
5|$|In his Commentary on Isaiah (1529), Zwingli {{noted that}} there were three kinds of governments: monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy. He {{expressed}} his preference for aristocracy which is not surprising given his experience with the Zürich council. In the publication, rather than comparing the three forms of government, he gave a defence of aristocracy against a monarchy. He argued that a monarchy would invariably descend to tyranny. A monarchy had inherent weaknesses in that a good ruler could be easily replaced by <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>one</b> or a single ruler could be easily corrupted. An aristocracy with more people involved did not have these disadvantages.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of Trollope's triangles, Mary is not called upon to judge between a good suitor and <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>one,</b> but between two good men. Gilmore {{is presented as a}} sympathetic and admirable character; the reader learns far less about Captain Marrable's character, and is given no reason why Mary should prefer him to his rival. To Trollope, a woman does not necessarily fall in love because of a man's merits; and it is very wrong for a woman to marry where she does not love, regardless of her suitor's worthy qualities.|$|E

25|$|It is {{not until}} {{we get to the}} sphere of the {{separate}} daemonical powers of nature that the opposition between good and evil begins, and the daemonical power is appeased by means of a stubbornness which it finds there congenial to it; the good daemonical power makes happy those in whom it takes up its abode, the bad ruins them; for eudaimonia is the indwelling of a good daemon, the opposite the indwelling of <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E

25|$|The majlis is {{also the}} means to elect a new caliph.

Al-Mawardi also said in emergencies when there is no caliphate and no majlis, the people themselves should create a majlis, select a list of candidates for caliph, then the majlis should select from the list of candidates.|$|E
25|$|Symonds and Gilchrist added {{a steady}} 70 runs before Symonds saw his stumps tumble to a superb Panesar ball. Warne then joined Gilchrist at the crease and put England's bowling to the sword, with a 58 run {{partnership}} in only seven overs, including a four and six {{off the first}} two balls Warne faced. Gilchrist was given out caught behind, although replays indicated the decision was <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>one.</b> Lee joined Warne at 7/317 but departed quickly, and Clark then delivered a sparkling tail-ender innings of 35. Warne's fairy-tale dream of a maiden Test century in his final match ended when he was easily stumped after swinging wildly at a Panesar ball, but he had earned the top-scorer mantle with 71, and England found themselves with a deficit of 102.|$|E
25|$|Oral tales, not {{recorded}} until much later, include the widely reported and possibly mythical one that Livingstone used to beat corpses at funerals with his walking stick {{to make sure}} they were dead and not simply shamming. His wife defended him passionately, claiming he was charitable to the hungry and sick. Her defence is quite plausible: Livingstone was quick-tempered and may have been violent and kind at different times. However, his distribution of food may have been limited to the headmen appointed by him to control the estate workforce rather than general. Her defence was that Livingstone was good master, not <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>one</b> as the commission claimed. The concept of the master-servant relationship was at the heart of colonial society, but this concept was precisely what Chilembwe was fighting with his schools and self-help schemes, and ultimately why Livingstone was killed.|$|E

25|$|In {{advance of}} {{becoming}} {{president of the}} Society of Authors in August 2013, Pullman led a call for authors to be fairly paid for ebook library loans. Under arrangements in force at the time, authors were paid 6p per library loan by the government for physical books, but nothing for ebook loans. In addition, the Society found that publishers had possibly been inadvertently underpaying authors for ebook loans. Altogether, this may have resulted in authors losing up to two-thirds of the income they would have received on the sale and loan of a physical book. Addressing this issue, Pullman said: New media and new forms of buying and lending are all very interesting, {{for all kinds of}} reasons, but one principle remains unchanged: authors must be paid fairly for their work. Any arrangement that doesn't acknowledge that principle is <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>one,</b> and needs to be changed. That is our whole argument.|$|E
25|$|At a later {{election}} Hackett {{was opposed to}} John Madden, and this time lost by only a small margin. In 1882 he resigned his positions at Trinity College and went to Western Australia to become a squatter in the Gascoyne district. His first season was <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>one</b> {{and he decided to}} give up the land. He joined forces with Charles Harper, the proprietor of The West Australian, and very soon his influence on this paper began to be felt. The Western Mail was established in 1885 and both papers became prosperous. In 1887 Hackett became editor of The West Australian and was a strong advocate of responsible government. Western Australia received its constitution in 1890, and Alexander Forrest selected Hackett as the first man to be asked to join the nominee Western Australian Legislative Council. The population of the colony was still under 50,000 but was beginning to rise, and the discovery of gold accelerated this. The newspapers grew with the population and became very valuable properties. Hackett, as editor, was writing a daily leading article, and was also the business manager.|$|E
500|$|The Act was {{considered}} <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>one,</b> since it required a [...] "very conservative investment policy for trustees". The powers given to investment trustees were restrictive and narrow, and the trustees {{were expected to}} go through expensive and complicated procedures to exercise them. The Act was criticised almost immediately for its complexity and outdatedness. A 1997 paper by the Law Commission called it [...] "overly cautious and restrictive", and suggested that some trusts were underperforming {{because of the difficulty}} of complying with the Act's provisions. The Trustee Act 2000 repealed most of the 1961 Act and now serves as the principal piece of guidance on trustee investments.|$|E

The scan revealed no knee ligament damage had occurred and it was estimated he would be injured for a month. He returned to training in November 2010, having {{been out of the}} team injured for almost three months, returning as an 87th-minute substitute in a 3–0 home win over League Two team Rotherham United in an FA Cup first round replay on 17 November. He scored at home for the first time for York with the 85th-minute winner against Forest Green on 22 January 2011, the goal being a drilled shot into the bottom corner.

The severity of the sickness and the shattering of dreams might have broken lesser men but for Rivers in many ways the illness was the making of him. Whilst recovering from the fever, Rivers had formed a friendship with one of his father's speech therapy students, a young Army surgeon. His plan was formed: he would study medicine and apply for training in the Army Medical Department, later to become the Royal Army Medical Corps.|$|E
2500|$|Conversely, Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film two stars out of four, stating {{that it is}} [...] "neither a good movie nor <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>one.</b> It {{features}} actors that we like doing things we wish were more interesting." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times said, [...] "It is {{possible to have a}} good time at RED, but it is not a very good movie. It doesn't really try to be, and given the present state of the Hollywood economy, this may be a wise choice". Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said, [...] "It's not that it doesn't have effective moments, it's that it doesn't have as many as it thinks it does. The film's inescapable air of glib self-satisfaction is not only largely unearned, it's downright irritating".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 19th Century, travel between New York and Philadelphia, then America's two largest cities, was {{difficult}} and expensive. In 1800, a trip {{between the two}} cities could {{take as long as}} eleven hours on a good day and as long as twenty on <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>one.</b> In 1829, eager to reduce the cost and difficulty of travel, began investigating a cross-state canal and railroads. Railroads had already met with success in Britain and several American cities were planning lines of their own. The legislature, amid very aggressive lobbying, decided to build both a canal and a railroad. The canal and the railroad were to be built parallel to each other and controlled by separate companies chartered by the legislature. Each corporation was to give the state $100,000 worth of stock and pay a transit tax levied on cargo and each passenger carried. The corporation chartered to build the canal complicated this arrangement by deciding to also build a railroad. The legislature responded with a so-called [...] "Marriage Act" [...] to combine the two companies.|$|E
