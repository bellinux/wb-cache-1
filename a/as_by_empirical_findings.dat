40|$|International audienceDuring {{the last}} 25 years, Denmark {{is one of}} the European economies where the {{unemployment}} rate has changed the most dramatically. Previously, from 1979 on and up to 1994 it rose far above the EU-average. In 1993 a centre-left government took office, and a major change in economic policies was undertaken both with regard to demand management and labour market reforms. From 1994 to 2002, the official rate of unemployment was reduced from 12 ½ percent to 5 percent. This paper challenges the conventional wisdom put forward by a number of Danish and international observers that the major explanatory factor for this Danish “unemployment miracle” can be solely explained by the 1994 / 1996 labour market reforms reinforcing the existing Danish flexicurity system. To put the analysis into a proper perspective we have chosen to look at the development in employment in a somewhat longer period, because the ‘flexicurity system’ is well established, and {{has been a part of}} the Danish Model, since the 1960 s. Anyhow, it went through a number of changes in the 1980 s and 1990 s which might have improved the labour market performance. Hence, our task with this paper is to investigate to what extent jobs were created by demand management policies or by improved international competitiveness caused by improved labour market adjustment and wage cost moderation. The arguments are supported by a theoretical framework as well <b>as</b> <b>by</b> <b>empirical</b> <b>findings</b> concerning the Danish economy...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{the presentation of}} different operationalisations of components in different models of learning. Special {{emphasis is on the}} empirical verifications of relations between components. Starting from the research of congruence between learning motives and strategies, underlying the general model of school learning that comprises different approaches to learning, we have analyzed the empirical verifications of factor structure of instruments containing the scales of motives and learning strategies corresponding to these motives. Considering the problems in the conceptualization of the achievement approach to learning, we have discussed the ways of operational sing the goal orientations and exploring their role in using learning strategies, especially within the model of the regulation of constructive learning processes. This model has served as the basis for researching learning styles that are the combination {{of a large number of}} components. Complex relations between the components point to the need for further investigation of the constructs involved in various models. We have discussed the findings and implications of the studies of relations between the components involved in different models, especially between learning motives/goals and learning strategies. We have analyzed the role of regulation in the learning process, whose elaboration, <b>as</b> indicated <b>by</b> <b>empirical</b> <b>findings,</b> can contribute to a more precise operationalisation of certain learning components.

40|$|I {{designed}} a cross-sectional prediction study for which forty-nine Australian family mental health carers were recruited as participants. The variables {{used to predict}} the Positive and Negative Experiences of Caregiving were: Identity Coherence and Identity Diffusion; Good and Bad Identity Scales; Positive Interpersonal Relationships; Perceived Locus of Control; and Personal Growth. My study was innovative in that I explored Senses of Identities in family carers and used Personal Construct Psychology as a framework. My use of both the measures, Content Analysis Scales and Modified Rating Repertory Grids was new. Seven case studies were completed. I developed and tested a personal construct model of family mental health caregiving which included the development and testing of a Family Mental Health Caregiving Journey (FMHCJ) assessment tool. Findings supported propositions of the personal construct model. I modified the model <b>as</b> dictated <b>by</b> <b>empirical</b> <b>findings</b> from both predictive tests and case studies. Positive relationship between Identity Coherence and Positive Experiences of Caregiving and between Identity Diffusion and Negative Experiences of Caregiving were found. Positive Interpersonal Relationships were found not to predict Experiences of Caregiving. However, there was a trend for scores to be higher in carer samples when compared to normative samples. Locus of Control did not predict Experiences of Caregiving. Personal Growth significantly predicted Positive Experiences of Caregiving. The implications of the study’s findings and limitations were reported. An implication of the model was {{that it can be}} used as a framework to develop group interventions for family carers. Use of the FMHCJ assessment tool in clinical and research settings was recommended, particularly as a means to attend to the impact mental illness has on carers’ identities.

Second, incomplete insurance combined with either borrowing constraints or transaction costs offers predictions consistent with <b>empirical</b> <b>findings.</b> In addition, the failure of insuring persistent or permanent shocks alone yields empirically reasonable predictions. Third, recent theoretical research has made attempts to endogenize incomplete insurance from first principles. Fourth, incomplete markets may make aggregate shocks distributed disproportionately among agents, thereby having {{a significant impact on}} dynamic allocation and pricing. Finally the theoretical research into incomplete markets triggers a reassessment of welfare implications as to business cycles, economic growth, and financial integration. ...|$|R

Where production is all or nothing, there is a unique subgame-perfect equilibrium: the largest firms exit first (P. Ghemawat and B. Nalebuff [1985]). In this paper, firms continuously adjust capacity. Again, there is a unique subgame-perfect equilibrium.

40|$|Residual {{errors of}} {{hydrological}} models are usually both heteroscedastic and autocorrelated. However, {{only a few}} studies have attempted to explicitly include these two statistical properties into the residual error model and jointly infer them with the hydrological model parameters. This technical note shows that applying autoregressive error models to raw heteroscedastic residuals, as done in some recent studies, can lead to unstable error models with poor predictive performance. This instability can be avoided by applying the autoregressive process to standardized residuals. The theoretical analysis is supported <b>by</b> <b>empirical</b> <b>findings</b> in three hydrologically distinct catchments. The case studies also highlight strong interactions between the parameters of autoregressive residual error models and the water balance parameters of the hydrological model...|$|R

40|$|Singapore’s {{regionalization}} stratagem led to {{the establishment}} of industrial parks in China, India and several South-East Asian countries.
