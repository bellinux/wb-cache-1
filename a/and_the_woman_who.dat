5|$|Whale {{directed}} his final film in 1950, a short subject {{based on the}} William Saroyan one-act play Hello Out There. The film, financed by supermarket heir Huntington Hartford, {{was the story of}} a man in a Texas jail falsely accused of rape <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> cleans the jail. Hartford intended for the short to be part of an anthology film along the lines of Quartet. However, attempts to find appropriate short fiction companion pieces to adapt were unsuccessful and Hello Out There was never commercially released.|$|E
5|$|Carlo Maggi, a Catholic {{acquaintance}} of Momolo's {{who was also}} a retired judge, sent a report of Lepori's refutation to Scazzocchio, who asked Antonelli to pass it on to the Pope. A cover letter attached to Maggi's statement described it as proof that Morisi's story was false. Scazzocchio also forwarded an affidavit from the Mortara family doctor, Pasquale Saragoni, who acknowledged that Edgardo had fallen sick when he was about a year old, but stated that he had never been in danger of dying, and that in any case Morisi had been herself bedridden at the time she was supposed to have baptised the boy. A further report sent from Bologna in October 1858, comprising the statements of eight women and one man, all Catholics, corroborated the doctor's claims about the sicknesses of Edgardo and Morisi respectively, and alleged that the former maid was given to theft and sexual impropriety. Four women, including the servant Anna Facchini <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> had employed Morisi after she left the Mortaras, Elena Pignatti, claimed that Morisi had regularly flirted with Austrian officers and invited them into her employers' homes for sex.|$|E

25|$|The breast {{reduction}} {{performed with}} the free nipple-graft technique transposes the nipple-areola complex (NAC) as a tissue graft without a blood supply, without a skin and glandular pedicle. The therapeutic advantage is the greater volume of breast tissues (glandular, adipose, skin) that can be resected to produce a proportionate breast. The therapeutic disadvantage is a breast without a sensitive nipple-areola complex, and without lactational capability. The medically indicated candidates are: the woman whose health presents {{a high risk of}} ischemia (localized tissue anemia) of the nipple-areola complex, which might cause tissue necrosis; the diabetic woman; the woman who is a tobacco smoker; the woman whose oversized breasts have an approximate NAC-to-IMF measure of 20cm; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> has macromastia, requiring much resecting of the breast tissues.|$|E

The Italians plan on killing Carlito, but he manages to slip out through a secret exit. The Italians pursue him {{throughout}} the city's subway system and into Grand Central Terminal, where they engage in a gunfight. Carlito kills all of his pursuers except Vinnie, who is shot and killed by police attracted by the gunfire. As Carlito runs to catch the train where Gail and Pachanga are waiting for him, he is ambushed by a disguised Benny, who shoots Carlito several times in the abdomen with a silenced gun. Pachanga admits to the dying Carlito that he is now working for Benny, only to be shot as well. Carlito hands a tearful Gail the money and tells her to escape with their unborn child and start a new life elsewhere. As he is wheeled away on a gurney, Carlito stares at a billboard with a Caribbean beach and a picture of a woman. The billboard then comes to life in his mind, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>who</b> is clearly Gail, starts dancing as Carlito slowly dies.|$|E

For there are homes to which you cannot send a male deacon to their women, on account of the heathen, but you may send a deaconess... Also in many other matters the office of a woman deacon is required."

2500|$|Scholasticus then {{introduces}} Hypatia, {{the female}} philosopher of Alexandria <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> became {{a target of}} the Christian anger that was inflamed during the feud. She {{was the daughter of}} Theon and a teacher trained in the philosophical schools of Plato and Plotinus. She was admired by most for her dignity and virtue. Scholasticus writes that Hypatia ultimately fell [...] "victim to the political jealousy which at the time prevailed". Orestes was known to seek her counsel, and a rumor spread among the Christian community of Alexandria blaming her for Orestes's unwillingness to reconcile with Cyril. A mob of Christians gathered, led by a reader (i.e., a minor cleric) named Peter, whom Scholasticus calls a fanatic. They kidnapped Hypatia on her way home and took her to the [...] "Church called Caesareum. They then completely stripped her, and then murdered her with tiles." [...] Socrates Scholasticus was interpreted as saying that, while she was still alive, Hypatia's flesh was torn off , which literally means [...] "with or by oyster shells, potsherds or roof tiles". Afterward, the men proceeded to mutilate her and, finally, burn her limbs. News of Hypatia's murder provoked great public denouncement, not only against Cyril but against the whole Alexandrian Christian community. Scholasticus closes with a lament: [...] "Surely nothing can be farther from the spirit of Christianity than the allowance of massacres, fights, and transactions of that sort." ...|$|E
