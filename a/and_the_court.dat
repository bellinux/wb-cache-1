5|$|As {{a result}} of the Second Dutch War, Charles {{dismissed}} Lord Clarendon, whom he used as a scapegoat for the war. Clarendon fled to France when impeached for high treason (which carried the penalty of death). Power passed to five politicians known collectively by a whimsical acronym as the Cabal—Clifford, Arlington, Buckingham, Ashley (afterwards Earl of Shaftesbury) and Lauderdale. In fact, the Cabal rarely acted in concert, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> was often divided between two factions led by Arlington and Buckingham, with Arlington the more successful.|$|E

5|$|Because Justice Anthony Kennedy did {{not join}} Stevens' opinion as to several parts, largely {{on the grounds of}} {{judicial}} parsimony (that is, having decided that the military commissions had no foundation, the core question of the case was decided <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> did not need to go further), those sections were without a majority in support.|$|E
5|$|Cresswell {{was in a}} rare {{position}} for many reasons. Although she was of common birth, a woman and unmarried, she rose {{to a position of}} high status, running a large business enterprise.

5|$|In 1964, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Reynolds v. Sims that state {{legislative}} seats must be apportioned {{on the principle}} of one man, one vote. A number of state legislatures, including Maryland, had systems based on geography rather than population, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> rules that this violated the 14th Amendment. Disproportionate population growth across Maryland since 1838 meant that the principle of one seat per county gave the voters of some counties, such as those on the eastern shore, disproportionate representation. Other counties, especially those in suburban areas, were underrepresented.|$|E
5|$|Matthias {{dismissed}} his Chief Chancellor Archbishop Szécsi, replacing {{him with}} Stephen Várdai, Archbishop of Kalocsa, and John Vitéz. Both prelates bore {{the title of}} Chief and Secret Chancellor, but Várdai was the actual leader of the Royal Chancery. Around the same time, Matthias united the superior courts of justicethe Court of Royal Special Presence <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Personal Presenceinto one supreme court. The new supreme court diminished {{the authority of the}} traditional courts presided over by the barons and contributed to the professionalization of the administration of justice.

5|$|Monarchs {{and other}} dignitaries were often in {{attendance}} at the cathedral, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> occasionally held session there.
