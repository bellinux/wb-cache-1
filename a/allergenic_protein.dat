40|$|A skin prick {{test was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the skin allergic reaction of piglets caused by <b>allergenic</b> <b>proteins</b> contained in soybean meal. The data accumulated from subcutaneous piglet skin tissue indicated that <b>allergenic</b> <b>proteins</b> contained in soybean meal crude extracts, even in low dosage levels (7 mu g), caused immunological redness and inflammation within 5 min. The dosages above 200 mu g of beta-conglycinin caused inflammation covering a larger area. The glycinin had less of an influence on skin allergenic reaction dosages than beta-conglycinin did. The antibodies used for beta-conglycinin and glycinin subunits did not exhibit cross-recognition to other subunits or Leguminosae members, such as green beans, lupins and red beans. The polyclonal antibodies further indicated that some <b>allergenic</b> <b>proteins</b> were present after examining soybean meal fermented products individually by Aspergillus or Lactobacillus.

Liposomes were reconstituted in size by including trehalose sugar in the formulation.

Gustafsson (2005) Bioinformatics, 21, 39 – 50. First, we developed methods based on support vector machine using amino acid and dipeptide composition and achieved an accuracy of 85. 02 and 84. 00 %, respectively. Second, a motif-based method has been developed using MEME/MAST software that achieved sensitivity of 93. 94 with 33. 34 % specificity.

50|$|Allergic {{reactions}} are hyperactive {{responses of the}} immune system to generally innocuous substances. When immune cells encounter the <b>allergenic</b> <b>protein,</b> IgE antibodies are produced; this is similar to the immune system's reaction to foreign pathogens. The IgE antibodies identify the allergenic proteins as harmful and initiate the allergic reaction. The harmful proteins are those that do not break down due to the strong bonds of the protein. IgE antibodies bind to a receptor {{on the surface of the}} protein, creating a tag, just as a virus or parasite becomes tagged. Why some proteins do not denature and subsequently trigger allergic reactions and hypersensitivity while others do is not entirely clear.|$|E

Several alternate {{strategies for the}} treatment of food allergies are currently under study. Also being explored is the process of eliminating <b>allergenic</b> <b>proteins</b> from crop plants. Legumes are a rich source of protein and are an essential component of the human diet. Unfortunately, legumes, including soybean and peanut, are also common sources of food allergens. Four protein families and superfamilies account for the majority of legume allergens, which include storage proteins of seeds (cupins and prolamins), profilins, and the larger group of pathogenesis-related proteins. Two strategies have been used to produce hypoallergenic legume crops: (1) germplasm lines are screened for the absence or reduced content of specific <b>allergenic</b> <b>proteins</b> and (2) genetic transformation is used to silence native genes encoding <b>allergenic</b> <b>proteins.</b> Both approaches have been successful in producing cultivars of soybeans and peanuts with reduced <b>allergenic</b> <b>proteins.</b> However, it is unknown whether the cultivars are actually hypoallergenic to those with sensitivity.

Therefore, the present study aimed to elucidate the ability of chlorine bleach (NaOCl) to reduce the immunogenicity of the major <b>allergenic</b> <b>protein</b> of Japanese cedar (Cry j 1). Methods: Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay, and skin testing were carried out in 7 individuals. Results: The <b>allergenic</b> <b>protein</b> was undetectable using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining at a sodium hypochlorite/allergenic protein molar ratio of 457.

Buckwheat allergenic proteins with molecu-lar masses of 9, 14, 16 - 18, 19, 22 - 24, 26 and 67 - 70 kDa have been reported.

40|$|Abstract Background Transgenic {{proteins}} {{expressed by}} {{genetically modified food}} crops are evaluated for their potential allergenic properties prior to marketing, among others by identification of short identical amino acid sequences that occur both in the transgenic <b>protein</b> and <b>allergenic</b> <b>proteins.</b> A strategy is proposed, in which the positive outcomes of the sequence comparison with a minimal length of six amino acids are further screened {{for the presence of}} potential linear IgE-epitopes. This double track approach involves the use of literature data on IgE-epitopes and an antigenicity prediction algorithm. Results Thirty-three transgenic proteins have been screened for identities of at least six contiguous amino acids shared with <b>allergenic</b> <b>proteins.</b> Twenty-two transgenic proteins showed positive results of six- or seven-contiguous amino acids length. Only a limited number of identical stretches shared by transgenic proteins (papaya ringspot virus coat protein, acetolactate synthase GH 50, and glyphosate oxidoreductase) and <b>allergenic</b> <b>proteins</b> could be identified as (part of) potential linear epitopes. Conclusion Many transgenic proteins have identical stretches of six or seven amino acids in common with <b>allergenic</b> <b>proteins.</b> Most identical stretches are likely to be false positives. As shown in this study, identical stretches can be further screened for relevance by comparison with linear IgE-binding epitopes described in literature. In the absence of literature data on epitopes, antigenicity prediction by computer aids to select potential antibody binding sites that will need verification of IgE binding by sera binding tests. Finally, the positive outcomes of this approach warrant further clinical testing for potential allergenicity. </p...|$|R
