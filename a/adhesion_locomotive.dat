He built the locomotive Blücher, also a successful flanged-wheel <b>adhesion</b> <b>locomotive.</b> [...] In 1825 he built the locomotive Locomotion for the Stockton and Darlington Railway in the north east of England, which became the first public steam railway in the world in 1825, although it used both horse power and steam power on different runs. In 1829, he built the locomotive Rocket, which entered in and won the Rainhill Trials. This success led to Stephenson establishing his company as the pre-eminent builder of steam locomotives for railways in Great Britain and Ireland, the United States, and much of Europe. The first public railway which used only steam locomotives, all the time, was Liverpool and Manchester Railway, built in 1830.|$|E
50|$|The {{class was}} so named under the Swiss {{locomotive}} and railcar classification system. According to that system, Ge 2/4 denotes a narrow gauge electric <b>adhesion</b> <b>locomotive</b> {{with a total}} of four axles, two of which are drive axles.|$|E

50|$|The Chilean Transandine railway was {{originally}} worked by Kitson-Meyer 0-8-6-0s rack and <b>adhesion</b> <b>locomotives,</b> {{two examples of}} which survive in Chile. The line was electrified in 1927 with Swiss-built electric locomotives.|$|R
5000|$|The EF62s {{were the}} first <b>adhesion</b> <b>locomotives</b> used on the Shinetsu Main Line {{following}} the abandonment of the under-powered ED42 rack-and-pinion locos dating from the 1930s.

According to that system, Ge 2/2 denotes a narrow gauge electric <b>adhesion</b> <b>locomotive</b> {{with a total}} of two axles, both of which are drive axles. There are only two locomotives in the class, and they are numbered 161 and 162.|$|E
50|$|The {{class is}} {{so named because}} it was the first class of {{locomotives}} of the Swiss locomotive and railcar classification type Ge 4/4 to be acquired by the Rhaetian Railway. According to that type designation, Ge 4/4 denotes a narrow gauge electric <b>adhesion</b> <b>locomotive</b> with a total of four axles, all of which are drive axles.|$|E
5000|$|The Dowlais Company's line linking {{their works}} to the Merthyr Tramroad had a maximum {{gradient}} of 1 in 16.5 and considered too steep for locomotives {{to work by}} adhesion alone. In 1832 the Neath Abbey Ironworks supplied a six-wheeled rack and <b>adhesion</b> <b>locomotive</b> weighing 8 tons named [...] "Perseverance" [...] with inclined cylinders and twin chimneys (allowing them to be lowered alongside the boiler {{to pass through the}} tunnel at Plymouth).|$|E
50|$|Sanderson became {{concerned}} at {{the severity of}} the proposed route via Whaley Bridge and over Rushup Edge into the Hope Valley. He suggested another, via Penistone, that would involve less tunnelling, and have gentler gradients which could be worked by <b>adhesion</b> <b>locomotives.</b> After much indecision the project was abandoned, and the Sheffield and Manchester company was wound up.|$|R

50|$|The two {{locomotives}} {{represent a}} {{further development of}} the Ge 4/4 II class of the Rhaetian Railway. They are therefore classified as Ge 4/4 III under the Swiss locomotive and railcar classification system, even though the FO had not previously operated Ge 4/4 type locomotives. According to the Swiss classification system, Ge 4/4 III denotes a third series of narrow gauge electric <b>adhesion</b> <b>locomotives</b> with four axles, {{all of which are}} drive axles.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of improved traction control and adoption of AC traction motors {{has led to}} the {{development of}} high adhesion locomotives. Rollingstock manufacturers have been successful in marketing these high adhesion locomotives to train operators because of the increase in continuous tractive effort these locomotives provide allowing larger trains to be hauled over ruling grades. Some concerns have been held by track infrastructure owners in the Australian rail industry about the rail damage associated with high adhesion locomotives in operation on the tight curves associated with ruling grades. This paper uses vehicle dynamics simulation to determine the wheel rail contact forces of high <b>adhesion</b> <b>locomotive</b> operations on steep grades (up to 1 in 37) and compares the advantages to be gained from the use of distributed power and steering bogie designs to current locomotives and head end trains. The reduction of the available adhesion due to wheelset angle of attack is demonstrated by the simulation...|$|E
50|$|The {{shorter and}} steeper route was selected. While a {{gradient}} of 1 in 20 (5%) is not insurmountable by light trains with orthodox <b>adhesion</b> <b>locomotives,</b> safety and economical considerations {{led to the}} decision to install a rack track on the section up the escarpment between Waterval Onder and Waterval Boven. The rack track was built to the Riggenbach system which was in use on European mountain railways, with the rack laid between the rails.|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{steepness}} of {{the ruling}} gradient of 1 in 19 (reported to be the steepest grade used by <b>adhesion</b> <b>locomotives</b> in Australia) between Campbelltown and Kenny Hill, there were often multiple attempts made at ascending the grade. Passengers would sometimes have to disembark from the train and walk alongside it, leaving their bags on board. When trains could not successfully ascend the hill, the train would be divided and {{the second half of}} train (invariably the part where the passengers were carried) would be left standing on the line until {{the first half of the}} train had been stowed at Campbelltown. Such delays on the line were a source of annoyance and inconvenience for passengers. The main source of income for the line was the coal loader at Narellan and the Dairy Farmers Milk Co-operative depot at Camden. The line closed on 1 January 1963.|$|R

50|$|Puffing Billy is the world's oldest {{surviving}} steam locomotive, {{constructed in}} 1813-14 by engineer William Hedley, enginewright Jonathan Forster and blacksmith Timothy Hackworth for Christopher Blackett, {{the owner of}} Wylam Colliery near Newcastle upon Tyne, in the United Kingdom.

50|$|The Globe was a British {{newspaper}} {{founded in}} 1803 by Christopher Blackett, the coal mining entrepreneur from Wylam Northumberland who commissioned the first commercially useful <b>adhesion</b> steam <b>locomotives</b> in the world. It {{merged with the}} Pall Mall Gazette in 1921. Under the ownership of Robert Torrens during the 1820s it supported radical politics, and had a reputation associating it closely with Jeremy Bentham. By the 1840s it was more mainstream, and received briefings from within the Whig administration. In 1871 it was owned by a Tory group headed by George Cubitt, who brought in George Armstrong as editor. It was controlled shortly before World War I by Max Aitken.|$|R

5000|$|Traction or {{friction}} can {{be reduced}} when the rails are greasy, because of rain, oil or decomposing leaves which compact into a hard slippery lignin coating. Measures against reduced adhesion due to leaves include application of [...] "Sandite" [...] (a gel-sand mix) by special sanding trains, scrubbers and water jets, and long-term management of railside vegetation. On an <b>adhesion</b> railway, most <b>locomotives</b> will have a sand containment vessel, to apply sand onto the track; this is called [...] "sanding".|$|R
5000|$|On an <b>adhesion</b> railway, most <b>locomotives</b> {{will have}} a sand {{containment}} vessel. Properly dried sand can be dropped onto the rail to improve traction under slippery conditions. The sand is most often applied using compressed air via tower, crane, silo or train. When an engine slips, particularly when starting a heavy train, sand applied {{at the front of}} the driving wheels greatly aids in tractive effort causing the train to [...] "lift", or to commence the motion intended by the engine driver.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{visually}} striking features of a steam locomotive is its wheel arrangement which is largely a function of its intended application and purpose. The fundamental principle of design for 19th century steam locomotives was tractive force which relies on <b>adhesion.</b> A switching <b>locomotive</b> for example, is relatively low-powered but with a high starting tractive effort for getting heavy cars rolling quickly. These locomotives are geared to produce high torque but are restricted to low top speeds and have small diameter driving wheels. Switchers are rail analogs to tugboats. For higher speeds, larger boilers were required which in turn {{led to the development}} of lead trucks.|$|R
40|$|The {{traction}} control in modern electric and diesel electric locomotives has allowed rail operators to utilise high traction adhesion levels without undue {{risk of damage}} from uncontrolled wheel spin. At the same time, some locomotive manufacturers have developed passive steering locomotive bogies to reduce wheel rail wear and further improve <b>locomotive</b> <b>adhesion</b> performance on curves. High locomotive traction loads in curving are known to cause the loss of steering performance in passive steering bogies. At present there are few publications on the curving performance of locomotive steering with linkage bogies. The most extreme traction curving cases of low speed and high <b>adhesion</b> for hauling <b>locomotives</b> have not been fully investigated, with effects of coupler forces and cant excess being generally ignored. This paper presents a simulation study for three axle bogie locomotives in pusher and pulling train positions on tight curves. The simulation study uses moderate and high traction adhesion levels of 16. 6 % and 37 % for various rail friction conditions. Curving performance is assessed, showing forced steering bogies to have considerable advantages over self steering bogies. Likewise it is shown that self steering bogies are significantly better than yaw relaxation bogies at improving steering under traction. As the required traction adhesion approaches the rail friction coefficient, steering performance of all bogies degrades and yaw of the bogie frame relative to the track increases. Operation with excess cant and tensile coupler forces are both found to be detrimental to the wear performance of all locomotive bogies, increasing the bogie frame yaw angles. Bogie frame pitching is also found to have significant effect on steering, causing increased performance differences between bogie designs...|$|R
50|$|At the time, John Blenkinsop {{was engaged}} in {{developing}} the rack and pinion system for locomotives, {{as a means of}} overcoming the problem of limited <b>adhesion</b> force of <b>locomotives</b> of the time. As the rack was cast with the edge rails in use, this cannot have been an attractive adaptation. It may have been for that reason that it was not until 1817 that Bentinck arranged to acquire a steam locomotive from George Stephenson. It was a six-wheel design of Killingworth type; the first and last axles were driven by pistons in two vertical cylinders set in the boiler top, and a chain drive working on central sprocket wheels connected all three axles. Photographs of an excellent model, considered to be accurate, are shown in the South Ayrshire Libraries history blog.|$|R
