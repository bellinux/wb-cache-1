40|$|The {{efficacy}} of a fumigant {{is determined by}} <b>the</b> gas concentration <b>and</b> <b>exposure</b> time. Typically, <b>the</b> gas concentration <b>and</b> <b>exposure</b> time are equally important in fumigation efficacy and their relationship is expressed as Ct = k, where C is the concentration, t is <b>the</b> time <b>and</b> k is a constant (Haber’s rule). However, deviation from Haber’s rule, i. e., {{the relative importance of}} time over concentration, has been reported for several stored-product pests, and a modified form (Cn t = k) is used to express the relationship between C and t. This study aimed to determine if this modified form could be applied to phosphine fumigation of the cigarette beetle, Lasioderma serricorne (F.). Adult beetles from six cultures with different phosphine-resistance levels were exposed to phosphine (1 – 2000 ppm) at 25 °C for either 24, 72, 120, or 168 h, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> phosphine concentration necessary to achieve 50 % lethality (LC 50) was calculated. The phosphine concentration (C) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>exposure</b> time (<b>t)</b> relationship at the LC 50 for all six cultures were determined by regression analyses. The equation Cn t = k was a good fit for all the cultures tested, irrespective of phosphine resistance. The results showed the exponent n was less than 1 (0. 51 ≤ n ≤ 0. 71, coefficient of determination 0. 90 – 0. 99), suggesting that time is more important than concentration in toxicity expression of phosphine against L. serricorne. Therefore, extending <b>the</b> <b>exposure</b> time rather than increasing the concentration should be emphasized to manage the future threat of resistance problems with phosphine...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{results have}} been {{obtained}} for mass transfer across liquid-liquid interfaces, utilising a novel Twyman-Green type interferometer and a flowing junction cell. Section One of the thesis is mainly concerned with mass transfer across plane interfaces. The system water-acetic acid-carbon tetrachloride was studied. Two cases were considered depending on the direction of transfer of the solute. In the first case acetic acid transferred from the water phase to the acid free carbon tetrachloride phase. Three initial concentrations of acetic acid in the water phase were used. The recorded interfacial concentrations showed that equilibrium was not established instantaneously. The growth rate of the interfacial concentration was comparatively slow, and was dependent on the initial strength of solute in the concentrated phase. The total amount of mass transfer (Mt) has been obtained {{as a function of}} exposure time <b>and</b> compared with <b>the</b> values of (Mt) calculated from theoretical equations. An empirical equation was developed to express the relationship between Mt <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>exposure</b> time (<b>t).</b> Having established the presence of an inter, facial resistance to mass transfer, {{it was found that the}} resistance was also time dependent. An empirical equation was developed to express the relationship between <b>the</b> interfacial resistance <b>and</b> <b>exposure</b> time. A modified pendant drop method was used to determine the interfacial tension of water-carbon tetrachloride interface for different solute (acetic acid) concentrations. The relationship between interfacial tension and interfacial resistance was established. An important aspect of the present work is that we were able to study the mass transfer process at very short time intervals from its inception. In the second case acetic acid transferred from the carbon tetrachloride phase to acid free water phase. Convective disturbances occurred in the carbon tetrachloride phase. This part of the work demonstrates the importance of the density changes accompanying the change in interfacial concentration. Section Two of the thesis deals with mass transfer to and from stagnant liquid drops. The total mass transfer (Mt), interfacial concentrations and concentration profiles have been obtained as a function of <b>exposure</b> time (<b>t).</b> Using this highly sensitive apparatus it is shown that at low concentrations (3 gm/lit) no eruptions in the drop surface could be detected while the diffusion occurred. At higher concentrations (30 gm/lit) eruptions developed almost instantaneously. This indicates the presence of a critical concentration of acetic acid at which interfacial eruptions occur...|$|R

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Biologically-based {{dose-response}} (BBDR) paradigms incorporate mechanistic {{toxicological data}} in the derivation of quantitative models to estimate risk. Developmental lead (Pb) exposure has been long associated with deficits in intellectual ability. To date, direct estimates of toxicant-induced functional alterations in brain that may underlie cognition have been lacking, obviating the utilization of quantitative modeling for toxicological endpoints of higher brain function. The utility of the long-term potentiation (LTP) model of synaptic plasticity {{in the context of}} Pb-induced cognitive deficits is explored in the present paper. In reviewing physiological and biochemical requirements of LTP that may overlap with cellular mechanisms of Pb toxicity, a neurobiological schema is constructed upon which we can begin to explore the possibility of applying BBDR models in neurotoxicology. Neurotoxicity represents the culmination of a sequence of pharmacokinetic, biochemical, and physiological events in the nervous system that follow <b>the</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>t...</b>|$|R

This study was performed to investigate the impact of UVA exposure on psychological and neuroendocrine parameters. Methods Fifty-three volunteers were separated into 42 individuals who had UVA exposure and 11 individuals who had no UVA <b>exposure.</b> <b>The</b> UVA-exposed volunteers had irradiation sessions six times in a three-week period. All volunteers completed two questionnaires at baseline (T 1) <b>and</b> at <b>the</b> {{end of the study}} (T 3). For the determination of serotonin and melatonin serum levels of all volunteers blood samples were collected at baseline (T 1), after <b>the</b> first UVA <b>exposure</b> (<b>T</b> 2), <b>and</b> at <b>the</b> end of the study after <b>the</b> sixth <b>exposure</b> (<b>T</b> 3). Results UVA-exposed volunteers felt significantly more balanced, less nervous, more strengthened, and more satisfied with their appearance at T 3. By contrast, the controls did not show significant changes of psychological parameters. In comparison to T 1 and T 3, serum serotonin was significantly higher <b>and</b> <b>the</b> serum melatonin was significantly lower for the volunteers exposed to UVA at T 2. Both, for exposed and non-exposed volunteers serotonin and melatonin levels did not significantly differ at T 1 and T 3. Conclusions It remains obscure, whether <b>the</b> <b>exposure</b> to UVA or other components of the treatment were responsible for the psychological benefits observed. The changes of circulating neuroendocrine mediators found after UVA <b>exposure</b> at <b>T</b> 2 may be due to an UVA-induced effect via a cutaneous pathway. Nevertheless, the positive psychological effects observed in our study cannot be attributed to circulating serotonin or melatonin. </p...|$|R

Maternal hyperglycemia during early pregnancy is associated with increased risk of abnormalities in the offspring which are 2 - 5 -fold {{higher than that of}} the normal population. THE AIM OF THE STUDY: Is to evaluate the effect of smoking in pre-pregnancy period of diabetic mothers on fetal development. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty diabetic female rats were randomly distributed in three experimental groups, according to presence or absence of cigarette smoke exposure: group I; twenty diabetic rats exposed to filtered air that serve as negative control group(D), group II; twenty diabetic rats exposed to cigarette smoke before and during pregnancy (DS) and serves as positive control and group III; twenty diabetic rats exposed only to cigarette smoke in pre-pregnancy period (DSPP). Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin and exposure to cigarette smoke for six weeks. At day 21 of pregnancy, rats were killed for maternal biochemical determination and reproductive outcomes, and fetal anomaly analyses.

Chairs: Dr. Catarina Almqvist Malmros, Dr. Thomas Frischer We analysed the incidence of respiratory and atopic symptoms in the whole paediatric population (3 - 14 years-old) of the district of Viadana (Mantua, Northern Italy), who were born to Italian and immigrant parents.
