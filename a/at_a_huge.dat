5|$|The baronial revolt {{was crushed}} between 1266 and 1267, leaving de Clare free to advance north into Glamorgan from his main base in Cardiff. De Clare started to {{construct}} a castle at Caerphilly to control his new gains in 1268. The castle lay in a basin of the Rhymney Valley, alongside the Rhymney River and {{at the heart of}} network of paths and roads, adjacent to a former Roman fort. Work began <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> pace, with ditches cut to form the basic shape of the castle, temporary wooden palisades erected and extensive water defences created by damming a local stream. The walls and internal buildings were built at speed, forming {{the main part of the}} castle. The architect of the castle and the precise cost of the construction are unknown, but modern estimates suggest that it could have cost as much as castles such as Conwy or Caernarfon, perhaps as much as £19,000, a huge sum for the period.|$|E

25|$|Altham {{says that}} CUCC began <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> public area called Parker's Piece but then became tenants at Fenner's in 1846. The club secured the lease of Fenner's in 1873. Francis Fenner {{had been a}} bowler with the Cambridge Town Club (CTC) and had {{acquired}} his land in 1846, perhaps {{for the express purpose}} of leasing it to CUCC. CTC and the subsequent Cambridgeshire CCC also played on Parker's Piece.|$|E

The campaigning for the first plebiscite was launched by Hughes <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> overflow meeting at the Sydney Town Hall where he outlined the Government's proposals.

He spoke with friend and San Francisco Sun-Reporter publisher Carlton Goodlett about his remorse over {{not being able}} to travel to socialist countries such as the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, speculating that he could be Chief Dairyman of the U.S.S.R.

25|$|If {{a single}} person makes and sells donuts and decides to try jalapeño flavoring, they would likely know {{on the same day}} whether their {{decision}} was good or not, based on the reaction of customers. A decision-maker <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> company that makes donuts may not know for many months if such a decision worked out or not, especially if their research or marketing team fails to respond in a timely manner. By that time, the decision-makers may very well have moved on to another division or company and thus see no consequence from their decision. This lack of consequences can lead to poor decisions and cause an upward-sloping average cost curve.|$|E

25|$|Miralles, {{like many}} other postmodern architects, has a {{preference}} for piling on the motifs and ideas: upturned boats, keel shapes, deep window reveals like a castle, crow-steps, prow shapes, diagonal gutters, 'bamboo bundles' and above all the dark granite gun-shape that repeats as an ornamental motif <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> scale. Everywhere broken silhouettes compete for attention, just like the alleyways next door. That's fine, and contextual, but it's quite a meal. As {{a result of the}} complexity, the parliament is really a kind of small city, with much too much to digest in one short three-hour sitting. The Scottish parliament will take time to judge: maybe not 50 years but three or four visits, long enough to absorb all the richness and get used to those jumpy black granite guns, the most arbitrary of several questionable ornaments.|$|E
25|$|As a young man, Davíð Oddsson {{authored}} or co-authored several {{stage and}} TV plays. During {{his days as}} political leader, he also pursued his literary interests, and in 1997 he published {{a collection of short}} stories, Nokkrir góðir dagar án Guðnýjar, which became a best-seller in Iceland. Davíð celebrated his 50th birthday <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> reception in Perlan, paid for by the Independence Party, and his friends published a Festschrift of more than 500 pages to which many Icelandic writers, scholars and politicians contributed papers. In the 1999 parliamentary elections, Davíð's Independence Party retained strong support, despite an attempt by a former government minister of the party, Sverrir Hermannsson, to establish a splinter party: the minister had been appointed director of the National Bank of Iceland and had had to resign because of financial irregularities. In 2002, Davíð published another collection of short stories, Stolið frá höfundi stafrófsins, which was also well received.|$|E
25|$|Kapil {{made his}} Test cricket debut in Faisalabad, Pakistan on 16 October 1978. Although his match figures were unimpressive, the numbers did not convey any measure of Kapil's {{contribution}} in the match. With his speed and bounce, he brought glee to the Indian players as the Pakistani batsmen were startled with bouncers that struck their helmets {{on more than}} one occasion. Kapil also captured his maiden wicket of Sadiq Mohammad with his trademark outswinger. He showcased his all-rounder talent when he scored India's fastest Test half-century off 33 balls and 2 sixes in each of the innings during the 3rd Test match at National Stadium, Karachi, although India lost the match and the series 2–0. In the ensuing series against a visiting West Indies team, he scored his maiden Test century (126) at Feroz Shah Kotla, Delhi in just 124 balls and had a steady bowling performance (17 wickets at 33.00). Ominous signs of Kapil's liking for England showed up in the ensuring series, his first outside the sub-continent. Kapil picked up his first 5-wicket haul and all of England's wickets, although it came <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> cost (48 overs and 146 runs conceded) as England scored a mammoth 633 and won the match comfortably. Kapil finished the series with 16 wickets though his batting haul of 45 runs (Average: 7.5) was unimpressive. His debut in ODI Cricket happened in the earlier tour of Pakistan where his individual performance was ordinary and it stayed the same as both Kapil and India had a poor campaign at the 1979 Cricket World Cup.|$|E

500|$|Croly lists Bushnell, Cleveland Mayor Robert McKisson, {{and former}} Republican state {{chairman}} Charles L. Kurtz as among {{those involved in}} {{what he called a}} conspiracy against Hanna. Kurtz had been defeated in his re-election bid to the chairmanship by Hanna forces at the 1897 Republican state convention, while McKisson had unsuccessfully sought Hanna's support in his first election run in 1895, and according to Hanna biographer William T. Horner, held a grudge as a result. [...] Hanna had also opposed his re-election in the municipal elections held in early 1897, speaking highly of McKisson's opponent to a reporter, and asking the reporter whether it was true that McKisson had secured renomination as mayor through fraud. [...] Despite poor treatment by the Hanna campaign—McKisson had been relegated to obscure rallies, except when called upon to introduce the candidate <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> Cleveland event, and the Hanna supporters had sought to remove McKisson men from election positions—McKisson had publicly supported Hanna for senator, making several speeches on the night before election day urging Republicans to vote the straight party ticket. [...] Nevertheless, sample ballots were sent to Cleveland voters, telling them how best to cast their ballots so as to minimize Hanna's chances, and Warken speculated that these had to come from McKisson, as the only person with motive and opportunity.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1962, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev {{was persuaded}} {{by the idea}} of {{countering}} the US's growing lead in developing and deploying strategic missiles by placing Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba, despite the misgivings of the Soviet Ambassador in Havana, Alexandr Ivanovich Alexeyev, who argued that Castro would not accept the deployment of the missiles. Khrushchev faced a strategic situation in which the US was perceived to have a [...] "splendid first strike" [...] capability that put the Soviet Union <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> disadvantage. In 1962, the Soviets had only 20 ICBMs capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the US from inside the Soviet Union.

Despite the media labelling her one of the favourites to win, the song was placed sixth. It was later remixed and used in a promotional campaign in Macedonia for the Škoda Octavia.
