5|$|When the 2013 festival {{began in}} Park City, Utah, the secrecy <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> continued. The festival's website only {{identified}} the setting as a theme park. Nan Chalat-Noaker, {{critic for the}} Park Record, recalls that the festival and even the film's publicist were unwilling to share further details about the film, but strongly urged critics to see it. In her review, she declined to identify {{the setting of the}} film by name, although she dropped broad hints, out of fear it would alert Disney's lawyers. The premiere, on the festival's first night, was not fully attended; when word got out to the attendees, all the other shows were effectively sold out.|$|E

500|$|Fincher was {{concerned}} that bands experienced in writing film scores {{would be unable to}} tie the movie's themes together, so he sought a band which had never recorded for film. He pursued Radiohead, but ultimately chose the breakbeat producing duo Dust Brothers to score the film. The duo created a post-modern score that included drum loops, electronic scratches, and computerized samples. Dust Brothers performer Michael Simpson explained the setup: [...] "Fincher wanted to break new ground with everything <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> and a nontraditional score helped achieve that." [...] The film's climax and end credits feature the song [...] "Where Is My Mind?" [...] by the Pixies.|$|E

[...] The Stage said she was [...] "out of her league" [...] while The Times wrote that she [...] "can act a bit" [...] and The Guardian said she [...] "holds the stage with ease." [...] In December 2014, the free-to-play video game app Lindsay Lohan’s The Price of Fame was released for the iOS and Android operating systems. Polygon said it was [...] "funny, trashy and surprisingly self-aware" [...] while Vulture called it [...] "a crappy knockoff of [...]" [...] In May 2015, a judge ended Lohan's probation after she completed the community service that resulted from her 2012 reckless driving, making {{it the first time}} in nearly 8 years that she was probation free.

500|$|Yankovic was {{inspired}} to write the song after he heard The Kinks' song [...] "Lola" [...] while driving in his car one day. He noted, [...] "I was driving a rent-a-car through Florida when the song 'Lola' came on the radio, and it got me thinking about how much fun I had doing 'Yoda' [...] where I took a then-current topic and combined it with a classic rock tune." [...] He soon {{turned his attention to}} the film Jurassic Park—about a park on a fictional island, where geneticists have succeeded in cloning dinosaurs. The film is based on the 1990 novel of the same name by Michael Crichton—which had just come out and was already a blockbuster success. Yankovic decided to write a parody <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> and considered various songs that he could spoof. Eventually, he decided to parody the 1968 hit single [...] "MacArthur Park", which was performed by Richard Harris. Yankovic approached the original song's writer, Jimmy Webb, who agreed to the idea. In fact, Webb was so amused by the parody that he later penned a letter to Yankovic that read, [...] "Well, [...] oughta [...] bury that song once and for all!" [...] In addition, Yankovic received permission from Crichton and director Steven Spielberg to produce the track.|$|E
500|$|Fox was in {{negotiations}} to star as Jennifer Check since {{the film was}} announced in 2007, and was officially cast in October 2007. Fox said the reason she agreed to the role was her love for the script. [...] "I think what I loved <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> is it's so unapologetic and how completely inappropriate it is at all times," [...] she said. [...] "That was my favorite part about the script and about the character. It's fun {{to be able to}} say the shit that she got to say and get away with it and how people find it charming." [...] Asked how acting in a film like this is different from acting in Transformers, Fox said [...] "there's [...] distractions, like there's no robots to distract you from whatever performance I do give. So, if it's terrible, you're gonna fucking know that it's really terrible". She said despite this aspect of the business being intimidating, she enjoyed portraying the character. [...] "I wasn't really sure what I was doing," [...] said Fox. [...] "I was just trying to have fun with it and I felt like I was able to make fun of my own image as to how some people might perceive Megan Fox to be. I was just sort of flying freely and I hope some of it works." [...] To prepare for her role as a living-dead teenager, Fox dropped to a near-frail 97 pounds and stayed out of the sun to keep her skin pale. In balancing out the film's horror with humor, she said she relied heavily on Diablo Cody's script and Karyn Kusama's direction to pull it off, stating, [...] "I have a very specific sense of humor, things that I think are funny aren't going to fly with middle America. It's going to eliminate some of the audience, so you need someone there to tell you you can't do that." ...|$|E
