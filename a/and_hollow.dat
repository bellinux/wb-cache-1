5|$|Agouti {{species are}} one of the few animal groups that can break open the large {{capsules}} of the Brazil nut fruit. Too many seeds are inside to be consumed in one meal, so the agouti carries some off and caches them. This helps dispersal of the seeds as any that the agouti fails to retrieve are distant from the parent tree when they germinate. Other nut-bearing trees tend to bear a glut of fruits in the autumn. These are too numerous to be eaten in one meal and squirrels gather and store the surplus in crevices <b>and</b> <b>hollow</b> trees. In desert regions, seeds are often available only for short periods. The kangaroo rat collects all it can find and stores them in larder chambers in its burrow.|$|E
5|$|Flaming arrows {{required}} the shooter to get {{quite close to}} their desired target and most will have extinguished themselves before reaching the target. In response, another form of fire arrow was developed which consisted of curved metal bars connecting a tip <b>and</b> <b>hollow</b> end for the shaft. The resulting cage was filled with hot coals or other solid object which could be fired from a much stronger bow or ballista without fear of extinguishing and {{would be used to}} ignite straw or thatch roofs from a safer distance.|$|E
5|$|The game is set after Kingdom Hearts II {{and follows}} {{the story of}} Jiminy Cricket, Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy in Disney Castle. In the game, players {{progress}} {{through a series of}} levels which are virtual representations of worlds contained within the digitized version of Jiminy's journal from the first Kingdom Hearts game, and are arranged according to the order in which Sora visited the worlds originally in Kingdom Hearts. These virtual worlds are based on various locales from many Disney animated films as well as original worlds seen in {{the first game of the}} series, including Destiny Islands, Traverse Town, Wonderland in Alice in Wonderland, Olympus Coliseum in Hercules, Agrabah in Aladdin <b>and</b> <b>Hollow</b> Bastion. Castle Oblivion also appears as the game's final level.|$|E

5|$|The octopus is bilaterally {{symmetrical}} {{along its}} dorso-ventral axis; {{the head and}} foot are {{at one end of}} an elongated body and function as the anterior (front) of the animal. The head includes the mouth and brain. The foot has evolved into a set of flexible, prehensile appendages, known as arms, that surround the mouth and are attached to each other near their base by a webbed structure. The arms can be described based on side and sequence position (such as L1, R1, L2, R2) and divided into four pairs. The bulbous <b>and</b> <b>hollow</b> mantle is fused {{to the back of the}} head and is known as the visceral hump; it contains most of the vital organs. The mantle cavity has muscular walls and contains the gills; it is connected to the exterior by a funnel or siphon. The mouth of an octopus, located underneath the arms, has a sharp hard beak.|$|E
5|$|The work {{of makeup}} artist Phil Leakey in {{transforming}} Richard Wordsworth's Carroon into the mutating creature {{was a key}} contribution {{to the effectiveness of}} the film. Val Guest, Anthony Hinds and Leakey all agreed that the makeup should make Carroon appear pitiful rather than ugly. Leakey placed a light above the actor in the makeup chair and then worked on accentuating the shadows cast by his eyebrows, nose, chin and cheekbones. The makeup was a liquid rubber solution mixed with glycerine to give the impression of sweat. Leakey's job was made easier by Wordsworth's natural high cheekbones <b>and</b> <b>hollow</b> temples and he also worked closely with cinematographer Walter J. Harvey to ensure the lighting in each shot emphasised Wordsworth's features. Leakey also created Carroon's mutating arm. The hand was created from a cast of the hand of an arthritis victim, enlarged and exaggerated by Leakey. The rest of the arm was built up using latex and rubber and, inside, had a series of plastic tubes through which fluid was pumped to give the effect of the arm swelling. A large sponge-rubber prosthetic was used for a brief scene in the zoo showing Carroon's mutation had advanced further. The shrivelled corpses of Carroon's victims, glimpsed {{from time to time in}} the film, were also made by Leakey.|$|E

He wore a white sash over an ultramarine costume, had large wild eyes <b>and</b> <b>hollow</b> cheeks under a turban topped with a spray of feathers, bulging thighs, immaculate tights. This was already Nijinsky in Firebird.|$|E
25|$|As loose-fill insulation: Exfoliated {{vermiculite}} {{treated with}} a water repellent is used to fill the pores and cavities of masonry construction <b>and</b> <b>hollow</b> blockwork to enhance fire ratings (e.g. Underwriters Laboratories Wall and Partition designs), thermal insulation, and acoustic performance. Expanded vermiculite has also been used as thermal insulation in the attics and walls of houses and in water heaters, fire safes, stoves, furnaces, and refrigerators.|$|E
25|$|In 1945, {{using the}} results of {{critical}} mass experiments, Los Alamos technicians fabricated and assembled components for four bombs: the Trinity Gadget, Little Boy, Fat Man, and an unused spare Fat Man. After the war, those who could, including Oppenheimer, returned to university teaching positions. Those who remained worked on levitated <b>and</b> <b>hollow</b> pits and conducted weapon effects tests such as Crossroads Able and Baker at Bikini Atoll in 1946.|$|E

Todd Sinclair, a senior official with Ring of Honor, received much of his professional knowledge and referee training from McCarthy <b>and</b> <b>Hollow</b> while a student there.|$|E
25|$|The {{hurdy-gurdy}} is a {{stringed instrument}} that produces sound by a hand crank-turned, rosined wheel rubbing against the strings. The wheel functions {{much like a}} violin bow, and single notes played on the instrument sound {{similar to those of}} a violin. Melodies are played on a keyboard that presses tangentssmall wedges, typically made of woodagainst {{one or more of the}} strings to change their pitch. Like most other acoustic stringed instruments, it has a sound board <b>and</b> <b>hollow</b> cavity to make the vibration of the strings audible.|$|E

25|$|The Noroton Cove {{settlement}} {{included a}} sawmill {{built by a}} dam on the Noroton River (a large stream and now the Darien-Stamford border) just north of where Interstate 95 crosses over the river. A small shipyard was founded {{on the shore of}} Holly Pond near where the present site of the Darien YMCA. A local blacksmith, Nathaniel Pond, owned a home built in about 1696 in Saltbox style at the corner of what is now the Boston Post Road <b>and</b> <b>Hollow</b> Tree Ridge Road. It is now the oldest house in town.|$|E
25|$|The fangs, {{which are}} {{enlarged}} <b>and</b> <b>hollow,</b> {{are the first}} two teeth on each maxillary bone. Usually only one fang is in place on each side at any time. The maxilla is intermediate in both length and mobility between typical colubrids (long, less mobile) and viperids (very short, highly mobile). When the mouth is closed, the fangs fit into grooved slots in the buccal floor and usually below {{the front edge of}} the eye and are angled backwards; some elapids (Acanthophis, taipan, mamba, and king cobra) have long fangs on quite mobile maxillae and can make fast strikes.|$|E
25|$|Manufacturing this trap is an {{incredible}} act in itself. The workers construct the traps on the stems of the plant, basically by making a raised <b>and</b> <b>hollow</b> platform on {{one section of the}} stem. The structure itself simply looks like a part of the plant, as if it grew in width slightly. The ants will also make small holes in this platform which are slightly wider than their own bodies. The individual workers will hide in these holes underneath the surface, invisible to their prey from the outside. They will position their heads outwards from the plant with mandibles open, waiting for prey.|$|E

50|$|When {{the tree}} was nearing 500 years of age, it was struck by lightning; the {{resulting}} fire burned slowly through the center <b>and</b> <b>hollowed</b> the tree out. The local Abbot Du Detroit and the village priest, Father Du Cerceau, claimed that the lighting striking <b>and</b> <b>hollowing</b> {{the tree was}} an event that had happened with holy purpose. So they built a place of pilgrimage devoted to the Virgin Mary in the hollow. In later years, the chapel above was added, as was the staircase.|$|R
