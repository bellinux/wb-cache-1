In his first chapter, The Jew and the Mission of Israel, he makes a distinction between Jews who are of the Jewish religion, Hebrews who are of the Jewish race, and Israelites who are a member of the Jewish community or nationality. The Mission of the Jews is the main justification of the survival of the Jews (i.e. the religion), to be [...] "priests and a holy nation", which is a purely religious vocation. To avoid assimilation all Jews who want Jewry to survive must be Zionists. The following four chapters give a history of different forms of Zionism, usually as to how it relates to England. Starting with messianic Zionism which is often millenarian and played a role in Oliver Cromwell’s resettlement of the Jews in England. He then looks at British advocates for Zionism, largely Christian, who he points out didn’t usually envision a Jewish state. In a chapter titled Practical Zionism he gives a history of the previous 200 years of Jewish settlement in Palestine. Political Zionism looks at Theodor Hertzl and the Zionist organisation, and makes the point that Political Zionism which needs a Jewish state is ultimately assimilationist. The following five chapters look at recent British involvement in Palestine, starting with the Balfour Declaration and finishing shortly after the White Paper of 1939. It is clear that his sympathies lie with practical Zionists (those who would settle in Palestine), but not political Zionists (who wanted a Jewish state). Whenever he talks of Jewish immigration to Palestine, he links it to the ‘economic <b>absorbtive</b> capacity’ of the country.|$|E

40|$|Metabolic {{disturbances}} are well-known, {{but sometimes}} neglected immediate consequences or late sequelae following urinary diversion (UD) using bowel segments. Whereas subclinical disturbances {{appear to be}} quite common, clinically relevant metabolic complications, however, are rare. Exclusion of bowel segments for UD results in loss of absorptive surface for its physiological function. Previous studies demonstrated {{that at least some}} of the <b>absorbtive</b> and secreting properties of the bowel are preserved when exposed to urine. For each bowel segment typical consequences and complications have been reported. The use of ileal and/or colonic segments may result in hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis which can be prevented if prophylactic treatment with alkali supplementation is started early. The resection of ileal segments may be responsible for malabsorption of vitamin B 12 and bile acids with subsequent neurological and hematological late sequelae as well as potential worsening of the patient’s bowel habits. Hence, careful patient and procedure selection, meticulous long-term follow-up and prophylactic treatment of subclinical acidosis is of paramount importance in the prevention of true metabolic complications. <br/...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to a study of {{possible}} scaling laws, and their logarithmic corrections, occurring in deep inelastic electropion production. Both the exclusive and semiexclusive processes are considered. Scaling laws, originally motivated from PCAC and current algebra considerations are examined, first {{in the framework of}} the parton model and QCD peturbation theory and then from the more formal perspective of the operator product expansion and asymptotic freedom, (as expressed through the renormalization group). We emphasize that these processes allow scaling to be probed for the full amplitude rather than just its <b>absorbtive</b> part (as is the case in the conventional structure functions). Because of this {{it is not possible to}} give a formal derivation of scaling for deep inelastic electropion production processes even if one believes that they are unambiguously sensitive to the light cone behavior of the operator product. The origin of this is shown to be related to its behavior near x ≈ 0. Investigations, both theoretical and experimental, of these processes is therefore strongly encouraged...|$|E
40|$|From some low {{frequency}} scattering investigations in radar, {{it is suggested}} that interrogating the target with 2 ̆ 2 ramp 2 ̆ 2 function has distinct advantages. This 2 ̆ 2 ramp 2 ̆ 2 function is a ramp in amplitude, not frequency. The returning echo is predicted to exhibit directly in the time domain, information of the cross-sectional area of a target as the ramp passes the target. From this information, one can infer size, volume, and orientation of the target. The theory for this interpretation is based on the physical optics approximation. This approximation is commonly used in acoustic and elastic wave scattering when the boundary conditions are approximate. The concepts can be 2 ̆ 2 verified 2 ̆ 2 by exact scattering theories for back-scatter from hard spheres (acoustic) and spherical voids (elastic). Our calculation for these two cases do show that their returning could show cross-sectional information. A proposed system to launch and receive ramp pulses will be discussed.

The {{effect of}} food {{restriction}} (FR) on the kidney cortex lysosomes prepared by rate and isopycnic zonal centrifugation was studied in rats with passive Heymann glomerulonephritis (PHN). FR reduced ttie renal mass by 41 %, but {{the capacity for}} handling of labelled endocytosed proteins by the lysosomes was not different from fed PHN rats. While PHN with heavy proteinuria increased the recovery of lysosomal enzymes in the large lysosomes located in the proximal tubule, no changes were observed in FR-PHN rats in spite of significant proteinuria. The density of the small lysosomes was significantly shifted/reduced (from 1, 200 and 1, 235 g/ml to 1, 185 and 1, 225 g/ml, respectively) in both fed and FR-PHN rats, suggesting that the handling of extra loads of protein may enhance the <b>absorbtive</b> function of small lysosomes found in {{the lower part of}} the nephron. FR reduced the mechanical fragility of lysosomes in the kidney cortex of PHN-rats. The highly increased urinary excretion of lysosomal enzymes in fed PHN rats was not observed in FR-PHN rats. As a conclusion, FR reduces both the fragility of lysosomes and the proportion of digestive enzymes in fragile lysosomes. These lysosomal enzymes may be of pathogenic importance in PHN causing cell damage when liberated from disrupted lysosomes...|$|E
40|$|NHERF 1 /EBP 50, an adaptor {{molecule}} that {{interacts with}} β-catenin, YAP, and PTEN, has been recently {{implicated in the}} progression of various human malignancies, including colorectal cancer. We report here that NHERF 1 acts as a tumor suppressor in vivo for intestinal adenoma development. NHERF 1 is highly expressed at the apical membrane of mucosa intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and serosa mesothelial cells. NHERF 1 -deficient mice show overall longer small intestine and colon that most likely {{could be attributed to}} a combination of defects, including altered apical brush border of <b>absorbtive</b> IECs and increased number of secretory IECs. NHERF 1 deficiency in ApcMin/+ mice resulted in significantly shorter animal survival due to markedly increased tumor burden. This resulted from a moderate increase of the overall tumor density, more pronounced in females than males, and a massive {{increase in the number of}} large adenomas in both genders. The analysis of possible pathways controlling tumor size showed upregulation of Wnt-β-catenin pathway, higher expression of unphosphorylated YAP, and prominent nuclear expression of cyclin D 1 in NHERF 1 -deficient tumors. Similar YAP changes, with relative decrease of phosphorylated YAP and increase of nuclear YAP expression, were observed as early as the adenoma stages in the progression of human colorectal cancer. This study discusses a complex role of NHERF 1 for intestinal morphology and presents indisputable evidence for its in vivo tumor suppressor function upstream of Wnt-β-catenin and Hippo-YAP pathways...|$|E
40|$|During {{a severe}} {{hemolytic}} process, circulating free hemoglobin readily {{passes through the}} renal glomeruli. Filtered hemoglobin is extensively {{taken up by the}} cells of the proximal tubule (1, 2). When the <b>absorbtive</b> capacity of these cells is exceeded, hemoglobinuria ensues. The permeability of glomeruli, and presumably of other capillaries, for hemoglobin is considerably greater than for albumin, a protein of similar mol wt (3). Recent information concerning the structural and physical properties of the hemoglobin molecule offers a possible explanation. Hemoglobin is a tetramer consisting of two pairs of unlike chains (a~ 3 ~). The molecule dissociates reversibly into two symmetrical dimers: a~ 2 ~ 2 aft. Under physiologic conditions of pH and ionic strength, a 100 mg/ 100 ml solution of human oxyhemoglobin is about one-fourth in the form of dimers, as calculated from a recently derived equilibrium constant (4). The reversible dissociation of hemoglobin into dimers, each with a mol wt of about 32, 000, suggests the possibility that it is this form that so readily penetrates glomeruli. The extent of dissociation is known to be affected by several conditions: (a) It is enhanced by dilution; (b) hemoglobins of various species differ widely in their tendency to form dimers (5, 6); (c) Simon and Konigsberg have recently studied the physical and chemical properties of hemoglobin that was reacted with the sulfhydryl reagent bis(N-maleimidomethyl) ether (BME) (7).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{experiments}} in chapters II, III and IV was to evaluate the potential for Cu-peptide absorption through the di- and tri-peptide transporter, PepT 1. For each experiment, intestinal tissue was mounted in modified Ussing chambers and total ion flux was measured. Mucosal and serosal buffer Cu concentrations, as well as tissue Cu concentrations were also measured to evaluate the <b>absorbtive</b> capacity between Cu sources. The study in chapter II was designed to determine if absorption from Cu proteinate could be reduced {{in the presence of}} PepT 1 inhibitors. Results demonstrated that Cu absorption from Cu proteinate was decreased when PepT 1 was blocked, while no effect of PepT 1 inhibitors on Cu absorption from CuSO 4 were observed. Overall, more Cu from Cu proteinate was found in the intestinal tissue post copper challenge. In chapter III, a study was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} decreasing the nutrient density of the diet on copper and nutrient absorption in ileal tissue of broilers. As indicated by change in short circuit current, the reduced nutrient diet, increased for glucose, Cu (Cu proteinate and CuSO 4) and for the di-peptide (Gly-Sar). None of the parameters measured indicated differences in Cu absorption between sources. In Chapter IV, a more purified Cu source was used to demonstrate the ability of Cu Triglycine to be absorbed through PepT 1. The PepT 1 inhibitor Valine-Lysine was able to reduce Cu-triglycine absorption into intestinal tissue, deomonstrating the capacity of Cu to be absorbed as a Cu peptide chelate, which was not found for CuSO 4 or Cu-tetraglycine. However, PepT 1 inhibitors quinapril and aminomethylbenzoic acid were not effective inhibitors of Cu absorption from Cu-tryglycine. Current findings suggest species variation for organic and inorganic transport of Cu. There is also evidence to support larger length peptide bound Cu (Cu proteinate) and Cu-tryglycine transport through the di- and tri-peptide transporter, PepT 1. ...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{influence}} of feeding a probiotic bacterium (Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415) on physiological parameters regarding transport functions (absorption and secretion) and barrier effects in the piglet jejunum was investigated. The conventional Ussing-chamber technique was used to study the effects on the absorptive and secretory properties of the epithelia. The sows were fed with the probiotic bacterium starting day 91. ante partum. Possible differences between the probiotic-fed and the control group were assayed by examining changes in transport rates after the different substances {{were added to the}} buffer solution. To study the absorptive attributes, a carbohydrate (glucose) and an amino acid (glutamine) were added in different concentrations. The changes in short circuit current (ISC) were observed and compared. Mannitol fluxes were used to assay differences in paracellular permeability. By adding different concentrations of PGE 2, a substance which induces chloride secretion, the secretory attributes were tested. For further analyses, the changes in short circuit current (= &# 916; ISC) were statistically examined and compared. 1. The probiotic-fed groups show a tendency toward a higher response of ISC after adding glutamine. These figures are statistically not significant. 2. The differences after adding PGE 2 showed a tendency of the probiotic-fed groups to lower values (except the age group 28 days). However, this was statistically not significant. A dose-dependant protection of the probiotic against chloride secretion could not be seen. 3. The group of probiotic-fed piglets aged 14 days showed significantly higher values after adding glucose in different concentrations. All other probiotic-fed groups also revealed higher <b>absorbtive</b> capacity than the control groups, although these differences were not significant. 4. No tendency could be found in the investigation of paracellular permeability using mannitol. Only the group of probiotic-fed animals aged 28 days showed significantly lower values than animals of the same age in the control group. Consistent with the hypothesis that mannitol fluxes are correlated to tissue permeability, the appendant resistance was also higher in that group. 5. The results of this investigation show a large variation. 6. The present work leads {{to the conclusion that the}} probiotic bacterium Enterococcus faecium can have a positive effect on the intestinal mechanisms, particularly in the critical phase of weaning. The severity of diarrhoeas commonly associated with these age groups could be reduced. 7. The tendency of the probiotic-fed groups to show higher absorption rates could have a positive effect on zoo technical parameters such as gain of weight and facilitate the feed changeover in the critical phase of weaning...|$|E
40|$|The Scottish Referendum of September 2014 was {{the setting}} for {{arguments}} regarding Scotland?s strengths and weaknesses, and projections of what could happen in different scenarios. Areas of debate included those on Scotland?s scientific performance and how to harness innovation to increase its competitiveness in the global economy. It encouraged {{a high degree of}} public engagement and prompted the three main political parties in London to promise enhanced devolution of powers and fiscal autonomy if Scotland decided to stay part of the UK. This paper outlines the perception of Scotland as a strong scientific and innovative society, and will outline the images of Scotland as a region and nation both distinct from England in culture and attitude, and as a participant in the knowledge economy. It will summarise the strengths and weaknesses perceived and measured in its science and innovation systems, briefly recount policy initiatives to improve them, and outline the main arguments made by the Scottish Government in 2014 regarding how enhanced autonomy could lead to a more innovative and prosperous Scotland. The science system has been strengthened during the 2000 s as devolution brought a set of new and expanded funding streams in conjunction with existing UK-based institutions. There are questions, however, about the relationship between the science base and Scotland?s innovation system, and the lack of coherent policy to address that ?disconnect?. The questions are related to the impact that enhanced autonomy may have on the absorptive and innovation capacities of Scottish business, with a particular focus on the potential impact of increased autonomy on: (i) <b>absorbtive</b> capacity, (ii) the organisations that support Scottish businesses in their innovative activities, R&D, technology transfer, commercialisation and finance, and (iii) on Scotland?s economy in terms of diversity of industry, specialisation and resilience. Beginning with the concept of imagined community, the paper first traces key background elements of the Scottish science system, and the relationship between science and innovation. Then, it details the present situation regarding Scotland?s science base, mapping the institutions that exist to integrate Scottish science policy. It shows that the science system already operates with some autonomy {{from the rest of the}} UK. This is followed by an analysis of the tenuous level of connection between science and innovation. The paper will outline the different concerns and opinions of the business and policy communities regarding Scotland?s innovation system, and it will summarise the questions being posed by different stakeholders regarding proposed independence and its possible impact on the Scottish Innovation System. Finally, it presents a summary of the future prospects for science and innovation and an evidenced argument for a less science-led policy led by a focus on new and transformed industrial sectors...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2012 Yıllar boyunca salonlarda akustik, dikdörtgen tipli salon şemalarında ve kaynak olarak klasik müzik kullanılarak incelenmiştir. Fakat günümüzde farklı müzik türleri için de uygun akustik ortamın sağlandığı salonlar inşa edilmektedir. İnşa edilen bu salonlar farklı plan şemalarından oluşabilmektedir. Bu şemaların ana karakterleri sahne yerleşimine ve izleyicilerin konumlanışına göre değişmektedir. Sahnenin kenarda olduğu klasik plan şeması, en uygun müzik koşulu gibi gözükse de, seyircinin sahneye uzaklığının artması gibi bazı sorunlara neden olmaktadır. Ayrıca sahne kabuğunun ayrı olması müzisyen ile seyircinin bulunduğu akustik çevreyi farklılaştırmaktadır. Salon içerisinde yansımaların homojen olarak dağılması gerekmektedir. Sahnenin ortada olduğu arena tipli salonlarda ise seyirci ile sahne etkileşiminin artmasına rağmen, sahnenin ve dolayısıyla müzisyenlerin yeterli yansıma alamaması gibi sorunlar açığa çıkmaktadır. İlk bölümde salon tasarımı için uyulması gereken tasarım kriterlerine değinilmiştir. Çalışmanın ikinci bölümünde salon değerlendirmesi yapılırken genel olarak kullanılan nesnel ve öznel değerler tanımlanmıştır. Aynı zamanda en önemli parametre olan müzik eylemi ve enstrümanların frekans değerleri ile ilgili bilgiler verilmiştir. Bu bilgilere göre klasik müzik dışındaki pop, caz gibi diğer müzik türlerine uygun akustik çevrenin tasarımı da tartışılmıştır. Çalışmanın üçüncü bölümünde, tasarlanan bir salonun özellikleri ODEON simülasyon yöntemi ile değerlendirilmiş, nesnel ve öznel değerler açısından irdelenmiştir. Üzerinde çalışılan ana salon şemasının plan, kesit şeması, malzeme kabulleri ve malzeme uygulama detayları bu bölümde verilmiştir. Kabuller ikinci bölümde belirtilen tasarım kriterlerine göre yapılmıştır. Simülasyonda kullanılacak olan alıcı ve kaynak noktalarının konumları, özellikleri bu bölümde yer almaktadır. Çalışmanın dördüncü bölümünde ise tavan, duvar, yansıtıcı panel gibi fiziksel tasarım parametreleri kontrollü olarak değiştirilerek farklar bulunmaya çalışılmıştır. Karşılaştırmalar çınlama, erken yansıma, geç yansıma, noktasal dağılım, bütünlük gibi değerlendirmelerin yapıldığı nesnel parametreler üzerinden yapılmıştır. Karşılaştırmalar seyirciler açısından yapılmakla beraber sahnede konumlandırılan ayrı bir alıcı ile performansçılar açısından da yapılmıştır. Alıcı noktaları bazında incelenen salon aynı zamanda parter bazında da irdelenmiştir.

Over the years, the {{acoustic}} of halls has analyzed in rectangular shape halls with classical {{music as a}} source. However, today, different type of halls can be built, which provide proper conditions not only for classical music, but also for popular music such as jazz, pop, Latin music. These different types vary according to stage and audience situation. The plan scheme, which the stage {{is located in the}} side, seems to be the best type for halls, but with the enlargement of hall, the audience starts to become wider to the stage. Also when the stage has another ceiling and rear walls, it has different acoustic conditions from the audience hall. This conditions seperate the musician from the hall. When the stage is in the middle, the warmth and spaciousness increase due to the close connection between source and receiver. Also musician and audience share the same acoustic conditions. However, when the stage is in the middle, the lack of walls near the stage and audience, which provide beneficial reflections, cause weak situation for the stage and audience. In the first section, the general purpose and the method of the study have explained. In the second section, {{the acoustic}}al parameters and the instruments’ frequency spectrums have explained. There are subjective and objective acoustic parameters. The reverberation time, early decay time, sound strength, clarity, eraly lateral, late lateral sound strength and support are main musical parameteres. Early reflections mostly creates appereant sound with which effects the first impression and spaciousness. Late reclections are mostly important for the envelopement. Every instrument have different rising and decreasing sound curves. There are some criteria to design a halll such as material combination, room shape, room volume. To make the material design, {{it is important to have}} the suitible reverberation time according to type of performance, hall volume. After deciding the reverberation time, the bass and treble ratio of the hall should be decided. Material combination efects the low frequency and high frequency distribution in the hall. When the low frequency distribution is too much the music in hall sounds without brightness. On the other side when the high frequency distribution is too muchs, the hall will loose its warmth. In every type of music, it has own tempo, frequency spectrum and instrument combination. The hall is also discussed which type of music can be performed in. There are three main musical genre which are classical music, jazz music, popular music (pop, rock etc). The classical music and jazz music have close instrumentation but different tempo and melody. But rock music is very different from classical with its low frequency instruments such as drum. The ideal acoutic design is distrubute the low frequency much. But the rock music has too much low frequency which dıstrubs the audience in a hall suitable for classical music. The hall which rock music is performed in should be <b>absorbtive</b> in low frequencies. xxii In the third section the information of hall, which designed for the study, has given. The plan and section scheme of the hall designed according to acoustical design criteria. The sight lines, audience number, reflection surfaces are important to evaluate the plan scheme. The material decisions are given according to hall volume, reverberation time and the bass – treble ratio. Because the stage locates in the middle, the stage walls should have maximum reflection as the side walls in the hall. The back side of the hall should be more absorbing to control the sound. To analyse the audience situation the receiver points are placed in every audience platform in the hall. The reciever - source positions and properties are given in this section. The source provides white sound which gives equal sound power in every one - third oktav frequency band. Receivers are omni receiver which collects reflections from every direction. In the fourth section, the physical design parameters have changed in computer based simulation program ODEON Combined 10. 0, to make a compare in order to have the numerical information about effects of these parameters. To analyze the effect of ceiling form, the plan scheme, material choices stayed constant and different type of ceiling forms are evaluated in the simulation. The ceiling forms veried from straight to convex and to concave form. Mostly in arena type of halls the suspended ceiling reflectors are used in order to increase the beneficial reflections to the stage. But the shape, dimension and the height of the reflector effects the quality of the stage acoustics. In the second comparison different type of reflectors with different dimensions are simulated. The dimesions of the reflector should be enough to contrubute the distribution of reflections especially to the back side of the hall. The dimension of the reflector also should be enough big to reflect the low frequency reflections. When the hight of the reflector lower than the optimum height, the sound is stuck between the stage and the reflector which causes lack of reflection in the back side of the hall. In this chapter the sound rays are showed distributing from the source until it is absorbed by the hall. The simulations are analysed for both audience and the performer. The side walls are another acoustical design parameter which provides envelopement and spaciousness. Due to the location of the stage, the platforms are located as wineyard to provide reflection to the stage and front platform. So that the side walls form and hight are important for the acoustical surronding. When the surface is convex it becomes more diffuser, which makes the sound distribution more homogen. In the third comparison the side walls between the stage and the platforms are designed in two different forms which are straight and convex. The height of the side walls are also important for lateral reflections. As the height of the side walls increase the acoustical quality of the front platforms increase. On the other hand due to the increased height of the side wall, the back platforms got further from the stage which causes bad acoustical surrounding. Also the hall is simulated with a symphony orchestra which has 80 musical instruments such as violin group, chello group, brass group, string group, wood wind, percusion group. In the fifth section, the evaluation of receiver values and the average values in different type of halls have compared with the optimum values. The objective parameters such as reverberation time, early decay time, early lateral reflections, late lateral reflections, support, ensemble, sound strength are copmpared in each type of halls. When the ceiling forms are discussed the most effective ceiling form is the convex form which has optimum height. If the convex celing form is too low, it prevents the reflections to reach the back side of the hall. To improve the reflections xxiii coming to stage the reflectors are analyzed and the optimum reflector is the seperate one which improves the reflections and doesn’t prevent the reflections reach the back side of the hall. Especially reflections coming from side wall are important to create envelopement for the audience. So that the convex form of the side walls are more effective then the straight side walls. The convex form let the reflections reach the back side of the hall. The convex form of the walls provides diffusion in order to have homogen sound distribution. The increasing the height of the side walls increase the early and late lateral reflections for the lower platforms but decreases the early - late lateral reflections and sound stength. When the orchestra has used in the simulation, the hall parameters provide the optimum values. The study has foucsed on the design effects on acoustical surrounding. Both the audience and performers are effected from these design decisions. Arena type of halls can have difficulties on having reflection especially for the stage conditions. On the other hand, it provides strong connections between stage and the audience. Differenet form of architectural design elements of the hall have compared with each other and with the optimum objective parameters such as reverberation time (RT), early decay time (EDT), early lateral reflections (LF 80), sound strength (G), Late lateral sound strength (LG 80), time center (TS) and support for the stage conditions. These subjective parameters calculates reflections and direct sound coming from the source and give results in every frequency band. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
