5|$|In {{the wake}} of the airstrike, Diệm became hostile towards the <b>American</b> <b>presence</b> in South Vietnam. Diệm claimed that the American media was seeking to bring him down and he {{introduced}} new restrictions on press freedom and political association. The media speculated that the United States would use the incident to justify the deployment of combat troops to South Vietnam in the event the U.S. remained circumspect. Domestically, the incident was reported to have increased plotting against Diệm by his officers.|$|E

5|$|Duc had {{years of}} {{experience}} in France, which had given him a good feel of how the French might be thinking and what their relations with Francophile members of the ARVN might resemble. He used this to concoct some plausible sounding and incriminating documents for Mậu. They purported to show that three prominent members of the junta: Generals Minh, Kim and Don had been bought by French agents and were on the brink of declaring South Vietnam's neutrality and signing a peace deal to end the war with the North. Some of the documents were leaked to elements of the <b>American</b> <b>presence</b> in Saigon and were {{brought to the attention of}} some senior American officials.|$|E

The protesters are opposed to the <b>American</b> military <b>presence</b> citing various concerns over sexual assaults and the environmental impact of the base.

5|$|Diem {{appointed}} Bui Van Luong—a {{family friend}} and devout Catholic—as {{the head of}} COMIGAL, the government resettlement agency. COMIGAL worked {{in cooperation with the}} United States Operations Mission, the non-military wing of the <b>American</b> <b>presence</b> and the Military Assistance Advisory Group. Although COMIGAL was purely dedicated to refugee issues, there was a constant turnover of public servants through their staff, and the benefits of continuity did not materialize. After only a few months in the job, Luong was replaced by Pham Van Huyen on December 7, 1954. COMIGAL were supplemented by American Catholic aid agencies and an advisory group from Michigan State University, where Diem had stayed while in self-imposed exile in the early 1950s. There were three phases in the resettlement program. With more than 4,000new arrivals per day, the northerners were housed in Saigon and Vũng Tàu in 42 makeshift reception centers. These consisted of existing schools, vacated French barracks, churches and tent cities on the grounds of Tan Son Nhut Air Base and Phú Thọ Racecourse. These could not be used indefinitely as the grounds needed to be used for their preexisting purpose, and furthermore, such ad hoc areas were vulnerable to outbreaks of fire and disease.|$|E

In exchange for 85,000 acres (344 square kilometers) of land, they paid about 1,250 dollars in goods. The Rombout Patent which formally granted the land to Francis Rombout and Gulian Verplanck was issued by King James II of England on October 17, 1685. After Gulian Verplanck's death, his estate was eventually divided among his heirs.|$|R

25|$|The late 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries saw {{a number of}} canals built. The success of the Erie Canal in the United States and the {{collapse}} of the Spanish Empire in Latin America led to a surge of American interest in building an interoceanic canal. Beginning in 1826, US officials began negotiations with New Granada (present-day Colombia and Panama), hoping to gain a concession for the building of a canal. Jealous of their newly obtained independence and fearing that they would be dominated by an <b>American</b> <b>presence,</b> New Granadan officials declined American offers. The new nation was politically unstable, and Panama rebelled several times during the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|The Taos Mountain Trail was the {{historic}} pathway for trade and business exchanges between agrarian Taos (New Mexico) and the Great Plains (Colorado) from pre-history (1100 A.D.) through the Spanish Colonial period {{and into the}} time of the European and <b>American</b> <b>presence.</b> The Taos Mountain Trail, between northern New Mexico and southern Colorado, connected the high mountain traders and their trading partners north and south of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Also called the Trapper's Trail, the pathway was only wide enough for people on foot or horses in single file, but it shortened a trip from Taos to the plains farther north from nearly two weeks to three days in good weather. The Taos Mountain Trail was also known as the Sangre de Cristo Trail and the Aztec Trail.|$|E
25|$|By {{this time}} the Ford {{administration}} had also begun planning a complete evacuation of the <b>American</b> <b>presence.</b> The planning was complicated by practical, legal, and strategic concerns. The administration was divided on how swift the evacuations should be. The Pentagon sought to evacuate as fast as possible, to avoid the risk of casualties or other accidents. The U.S Ambassador to South Vietnam, Graham Martin, was technically the field commander for any evacuation since evacuations {{are part of the}} purview of the State Department. Martin drew the ire of many in the Pentagon by wishing to keep the evacuation process as quiet and orderly as possible. His desire for this was to prevent total chaos and to deflect the real possibility of South Vietnamese turning against Americans and to keep all-out bloodshed from occurring.|$|E

25|$|The Vietnam War hastened the {{modernisation}} and Westernisation of Thai society. The <b>American</b> <b>presence</b> and {{the exposure}} to Western culture that came with it {{had an effect on}} almost every aspect of Thai life. Before the late 1960s, full access to Western culture was limited to a highly educated elite in society, but the Vietnam War brought the outside world face to face with large segments of the Thai society as never before. With US dollars pumping up the economy, the service, transportation, and construction industries grew phenomenally as did drug abuse and prostitution. The traditional rural family unit was broken down as more and more rural Thais moved to the city to find new jobs. This led to a clash of cultures as Thais were exposed to Western ideas about fashion, music, values, and moral standards.|$|E

The Eskridge car crash caused an uproar in Okinawa due to the raw emotion in the Okinawan population after the rape incident, the fact the Marines refused to hand over Eskridge, and continued opposition to the <b>American</b> <b>presence</b> in Japan.|$|E
