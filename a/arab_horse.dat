5|$|The Kathiawari {{is closely}} related to the Marwari breed from the Marwar region of Rajasthan, which borders with {{northern}} Gujarat. Genetic diversity analysis groups the two breeds, while the other four Indian horse breeds – the Bhutia, the Manipuri, the Spiti and the Zaniskari – form a distinct and separate group. The Kathiawari and the Marwari are also phenotypically similar; in particular, they have the same unusual in-curved ears. The Kathiawari is not as tall as the Marwari, and has a smaller thoracic circumference; it is most commonly chestnut, while the Marwari is usually black. Kathiawaris tend to have slight facial differences from the Marwari. The Kathiawari also resembles the <b>Arab</b> <b>horse,</b> which contributed significantly during the development of the breed.|$|E

The Morgan horse is one such breed, being in part descended from Welsh Cobs left behind by British forces {{after the end of the}} American Revolutionary War. They are crossed with Arab horses to produce riding horses, and with Thoroughbreds to produce jumpers, hunters, and eventers. Welsh mares have also been used to breed polo ponies that were agile and nimble. The Welsh Pony was used to create the Welara, a cross-breed of the Welsh and the <b>Arab</b> <b>horse,</b> which has been registered in America as a separate breed since 1981.|$|E

500|$|The Arabian or <b>Arab</b> <b>horse</b> ( [...] , DMG ḥiṣān ʿarabī) is a {{breed of}} horse that {{originated}} on the Arabian Peninsula. With a distinctive head shape and high tail carriage, the Arabian {{is one of}} the most easily recognizable horse breeds in the world. It is also one of the oldest breeds, with archaeological evidence of horses in the Middle East that resemble modern Arabians dating back 4,500years. Throughout history, Arabian horses have spread around the world by both war and trade, used to improve other breeds by adding speed, refinement, endurance, and strong bone. Today, Arabian bloodlines are found in almost every modern breed of riding horse.|$|E

Such was his concern for his horses that he had them humanely destroyed rather than have them commandeered by the British army {{at the start of the}} First World War. After the war he was able to return to his horses, and wrote an authoritative book, The Horse, as Comrade and Friend, published in 1920.

40|$|Genetic and {{phenotypic}} {{parameters for}} {{age at first}} start (AFS) and performance traits were estimated for Polish Thoroughbred and <b>Arab</b> <b>horses</b> using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) with an animal model. The traits representing a horse’s racing performance were log of earnings (EA) and square root of number of starts (NS). Separate analyses per first racing season and whole career were carried out. The first racing season comprised 1 759 Thoroughbreds and 1 026 <b>Arab</b> <b>horses.</b> The racing results of whole racing career were available for 1 319 Thoroughbreds and 815 <b>Arab</b> <b>horses.</b> The model accounted for fixed effects of birth year, month of birth, sex and trainer. The average of AFS of Thoroughbreds was 933. 2 days for first racing season and 935. 1 for whole career. The same AFS was observed at first season and whole career (about 1 199 days) in <b>Arab</b> <b>horses.</b> Heritability estimates for AFS were rather low (0. 15 - 0. 21). All genetic correlations for <b>Arab</b> <b>horses</b> between age and performance traits varied from moderate to high (from − 0. 25 to − 0. 85). For whole career of Thoroughbreds, the genetic correlations had opposite signs compared to those observed in Arabs. Genetic correlation between AFS and EA in first racing season was very low in Thoroughbreds (− 0. 07), whereas high between AFS and NS (− 1); the corresponding values for <b>Arab</b> <b>horses</b> were − 0. 25 and − 0. 76. The opposite signs of phenotypic and genetic correlations (0. 16 vs − 1 and − 0. 24 vs 1 in first season and whole career, respectively) between AFS and NS in Thoroughbreds were observed. Phenotypic correlations between AFS and performance traits were close to zero for whole career while were rather low and moderate (− 0. 22 and − 0. 37) for first season in <b>Arab</b> <b>horses.</b> Delay of the first start of Thoroughbreds is favourable {{from the point of}} view of future racing performance in whole career and has no effect on earnings in the first racing season. <b>Arab</b> <b>horses</b> beginning their career at a young age are start frequently and earn more money then those beginning their career later...|$|R

40|$|Background: Because of the {{economic}} importance of the <b>Arab</b> race <b>horses</b> and also the role of Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora spp. in abortion and reproductive failure of these animals, we decided to perform this study. Objectives: We designed this study to investigate the seroprevalence of anti-Toxoplasma gondii and anti-Neospora spp. antibodies in <b>Arab</b> <b>horses</b> from 12 cities of Khuzestan province in southwest of Iran. Materials and Methods: From October 2009 to March 2011, a total of 235 blood samples were collected from jugular veins of <b>Arab</b> <b>horses</b> of different ages and genders from 12 cities of Khuzestan province. All the sera were tested for anti-Toxoplasma antibodies using the modified agglutination test (MAT) {{and the existence of}} anti-Neospora antibodies were tested using N-MAT for Neospora spp. Results: According to the MAT results, antibodies to T. gondii were found in 114 (48. 5 %) of 235 sera with titers of 1 : 20 in 84, 1 : 40 in 19, 1 : 80 in four, 1 : 160 in four, and 1 : 320 in three horses. According to the N-MAT results, antibodies to Neospora spp. were found in 47 (20 %) of 235 sera with titers of 1 : 40 in 39, 1 : 80 in five, and 1 : 160 in three horses. We did not observe any statistically significant differences regarding age groups and genders between seropositive and seronegative horses for Neospora spp. using chi-square (chi(2)) test, but it seemed that anti-Toxoplasma antibodies were more prevalent in older horses (>= 10 years old). Conclusions: The results indicated that <b>Arab</b> <b>horses</b> are exposed to these parasites in southwest of Iran. Further research is required to determine the genomic structures of these parasites in <b>Arab</b> <b>horses</b> in southwest of Iran...|$|R

60|$|The steward next {{approached}} {{to take his}} leave, but in doing so, had nearly met with a fatal accident. It had been the pleasure of Raoul, who was in his own disposition cross-grained, and in person rheumatic, to accommodate himself with an old <b>Arab</b> <b>horse,</b> which had been kept {{for the sake of}} the breed, as lean, and almost as lame as himself, and with a temper as vicious as that of a fiend. Betwixt the rider and the horse was a constant misunderstanding, testified on Raoul's part by oaths, rough checks with the curb, and severe digging with the spurs, which Mahound (so paganishly was the horse named) answered by plunging, bounding, and endeavouring by all expedients to unseat his rider, as well as striking and lashing out furiously at whatever else approached him. It was thought by many of the household, that Raoul preferred this vicious cross-tempered animal upon all occasions when he travelled in company with his wife, in order to take advantage by the chance, that amongst the various kicks, plunges, gambades, lashings out, and other eccentricities of Mahound, his heels might come in contact with Dame Gillian's ribs. And now, when as the important steward spurred up his palfrey to kiss his young lady's hand, and to take his leave, it seemed to the bystanders as if Raoul so managed his bridle and spur, that Mahound jerked out his hoofs at the same moment, one of which coming in contact with the steward's thigh, would have splintered it like a rotten reed, had the parties been a couple of inches nearer to each other. As it was, the steward sustained considerable damage; and they that observed the grin upon Raoul's vinegar countenance entertained little doubt, that Mahound's heels then and there avenged certain nods, and winks, and wreathed smiles, which had passed betwixt the gold-chained functionary and the coquettish tirewoman, since the party left the castle.|$|E
6000|$|With {{racehorses}} {{selection for}} swiftness has been followed methodically, and our horses now easily surpass their progenitors. The increased size and different {{appearance of the}} English racehorse led a good observer in India to ask," [...] Could any one in this year of 1856, looking at our racehorses, conceive {{that they were the}} result of the union of the <b>Arab</b> <b>horse</b> and the African mare?" [...] (20/72. 'The India Sporting Review' volume 2 page 181; 'The Stud Farm' by Cecil page 58.) This change has, it is probable, been largely effected through unconscious selection, that is, by the general wish to breed as fine horses as possible in each generation, combined with training and high feeding, but without any intention to give to them their present appearance. According to Youatt (20/73. 'The Horse' page 22.), the introduction in Oliver Cromwell's time of three celebrated Eastern stallions speedily affected the English breed; [...] "so that Lord Harleigh, one of the old school, complained that the great horse was fast disappearing." [...] This is an excellent proof how carefully selection must have been attended to; for without such care, all traces of so small an infusion of Eastern blood would soon have been absorbed and lost. Notwithstanding that the climate of England has never been esteemed particularly favourable to the horse, yet long-continued selection, both methodical and unconscious, together with that practised by the Arabs during a still longer and earlier period, has ended in giving us the best breed of horses in the world. Macaulay (20/74. 'History of England' volume 1 page 316.) remarks, [...] "Two men whose authority on such subjects was held in great esteem, the Duke of Newcastle and Sir John Fenwick, pronounced that the meanest hack ever imported from Tangier would produce a finer progeny than could be expected from the best sire of our native breed. They would not readily have believed that a time would come when the princes and nobles of neighbouring lands would be as eager to obtain horses from England as ever the English had been to obtain horses from Barbary." ...|$|E
