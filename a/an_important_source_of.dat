5|$|The {{red maple}} is a {{used as a}} food source by several forms of wildlife. Elk and white-tailed deer in {{particular}} use the current season's growth of red maple as <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> winter food. Several Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) utilize the leaves as food; see List of Lepidoptera that feed on maples.|$|E
5|$|A study {{conducted}} in 1999 for the City of Portland by researchers from Portland State University found that Johnson Creek had marginal conditions for macroinvertebrates, <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> food for {{fish and other}} aquatic life. The study compared differences in these life forms and in water chemistry from two urban streams, Johnson Creek and Tryon Creek in southwest Portland, with two nearby rural streams and found that benthic communities in the urban streams were degraded compared to the regional reference creeks.|$|E

5|$|C. c. coronoides, the {{nominate}} or eastern subspecies, {{is found}} across most of eastern Australia. Its range is also {{highly correlated with}} the presence of sheep. This is thought to be because of the frequency of dead animals, which can be <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> food. Ornithologist Ian Rowley held that the eastern subspecies was expanding eastwards before European colonisation, and that this suggested it was of younger origin than the western subspecies, which appears static. The advent of agriculture facilitated further spread.|$|E
5|$|Capybaras are farmed {{for meat}} and skins in South America. The meat is {{considered}} unsuitable {{to eat in}} some areas, while in other areas it is considered <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> protein. In parts of South America, especially in Venezuela, capybara meat is popular during Lent and Holy Week as the Catholic Church previously issued special dispensation {{to allow it to}} be eaten while other meats are generally forbidden.|$|E
5|$|Cowpeas {{thrive in}} poor dry conditions, growing well in soils up to 85% sand. This makes them a {{particularly}} important crop in arid, semi-desert regions where not many other crops will grow. As well as <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> food for humans in poor arid regions the crop {{can also be}} used as feed for livestock. Its nitrogen fixing ability means that as well as functioning as a sole-crop, the cowpea can be effectively intercropped with sorghum, millet, maize, cassava or cotton.|$|E

5|$|Ebrey {{argues that}} {{although}} most of Emperor Wu's fiscal policies were repealed during Eastern Han, their damage to the merchant class and the subsequent laissez-faire policies of Eastern Han allowed the wealthiest landowners to dominate society, ensuring that China's economy would remain firmly agrarian-based for centuries. The Eastern Han central government lost <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> revenue by relinquishing its salt and iron industries and purchasing its armies' swords and shields from private manufacturers. However, this loss of revenue was often compensated by higher taxes levied on the merchants.|$|E
5|$|In {{economic}} terms, {{the late}} 1880s were {{a period of}} growth in the Orange Free State. Agriculture picked up, and the railway system became <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> income as well. Reitz was instrumental in the modernisation of farming, propagating new techniques and a scientific approach to the prevention of plagues. Here Reitz showed himself the agriculturalist and model farmer his father had been before him.|$|E

While on a diplomatic mission to Pope Clement X, he died of illness in Rome {{in the summer of}} 1674 and was buried at the Sant'Andrea delle Fratte basilica in the city.

Because their construction makes them especially difficult to clean, certain pieces of equipment are of much greater significance in this connection than others. In butter plants the churns are <b>a</b> particularly <b>important</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> organisms and, moreover, this contamination occurs subsequent to the pasteurization of the cream so {{that none of the}} organisms added by it are destroyed...|$|R

It served as a valuable lubricant, was used to oil wooden tools and utensils such as the coolamon, and was mixed with ochre to make the traditional paint for ceremonial body adornment.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> {{renewable}} energy and its technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar {{depending on how}} they capture and distribute solar energy or convert it into solar power.

Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light-dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air.|$|E
5|$|Later in the century, the {{production}} declined due to competition from imported European glass-ware. However, {{the products of}} Hebron continued to be sold, particularly among the poorer populace, particularly by travelling Jewish traders from the city. At the World Fair of 1873 in Vienna, Hebron was represented with glass ornaments. A report from the French consul in 1886 suggests that glass-making remained <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> income for Hebron with four factories making 60,000 francs per annum.|$|E

5|$|Nitrogen is {{the most}} common pure element in the earth, making up 78.1% of the entire volume of the atmosphere. Despite this, it is not very {{abundant}} in Earth's crust, making up only 19parts per million of this, on par with niobium, gallium, and lithium. The only important nitrogen minerals are nitre (potassium nitrate, saltpetre) and sodanitre (sodium nitrate, Chilean saltpetre). However, these have not been <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> nitrates since the 1920s, when the industrial synthesis of ammonia and nitric acid became common.|$|E
5|$|Ringed seals {{were once}} the main food staple for the Inuit. They are still an {{important}} food {{source for the}} people of Nunavut and are also hunted and eaten in Alaska. Seal meat is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> food for residents of small coastal communities. The seal blubber is used to make seal oil, which is marketed as a fish oil supplement. In 2001, two percent of Canada's raw seal oil was processed and sold in Canadian health stores.|$|E
5|$|Since 1916, the 18 {{counties}} {{where the}} O lands are located have received payments from the United States government as {{compensation for the}} loss of timber and tax revenue, beginning as a 50% share of timber revenue on those lands but changing over the years as timber production decreased.
