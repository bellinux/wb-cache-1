5|$|Droseraregia {{is often}} {{described}} as being a difficult species to cultivate, though modern reports on its cultivation have indicated which conditions have led to success for some. For optimal growth, D.regia appears to require good soil drainage and sufficient light levels, and prefers cooler temperatures. Cool nights and warm days have been reported to induce vigorous growth. <b>Asexual</b> <b>propagation</b> is frequently achieved through small root cuttings instead of leaf cuttings, which tend to rot before roots can form. Seed germination occurs as early as 10 days to 3 or 4 weeks with fresh seed, faster than many other Drosera species. Germination is phanerocotylar (non-glandular cotyledons exposed, free from seed coverings), with the first true leaves being alternate in arrangement.|$|E
25|$|Organism cloning (also called {{reproductive}} cloning) {{refers to}} the procedure of creating a new multicellular organism, genetically identical to another. In essence this form of cloning is an asexual method of reproduction, where fertilization or inter-gamete contact does not take place. Asexual reproduction is a naturally occurring phenomenon in many species, including most plants (see vegetative reproduction) and some insects. Scientists have made some major achievements with cloning, including the asexual reproduction of sheep and cows. There {{is a lot of}} ethical debate over whether or not cloning should be used.

500|$|The root {{systems of}} most Drosera are often only weakly developed. Serving mainly to absorb water and to anchor {{the plant to}} the ground, the roots are {{relatively}} useless for nutrient uptake. A few South African species use their roots for water and food storage. Some species have wiry root systems that remain during frosts if the stem dies. Some species, such as D. adelae and D. hamiltonii, use their roots for <b>asexual</b> <b>propagation,</b> by sprouting plantlets along their length. Some Australian species form underground corms for this purpose, which also serve to allow the plants to survive dry summers. The roots of pygmy sundews are often extremely long in proportion to their size, with a 1-cm (0.4-in) plant extending roots over [...] beneath the soil surface. Some pygmy sundews, such as D. lasiantha and D. scorpioides, also form adventitious roots as supports.

60|$|In animals the {{phenomena}} of <b>asexual</b> <b>propagation</b> are so obscure, that at present we cannot {{be said to}} know much about them; but if we turn to that mode of perpetuation which results from the sexual process, then we find variation a perfectly constant occurrence, to a certain extent; and, indeed, I think that {{a certain amount of}} variation from the primitive stock is the necessary result of the method of sexual propagation itself; for, inasmuch as the thing propagated proceeds from two organisms of different sexes and different makes and temperaments, and as the offspring is to be either of one sex or the other, it is quite clear that it cannot be an exact diagonal of the two, or it would be of no sex at all; it cannot be an exact intermediate form between that of each of its parents--it must deviate to one side or the other. You do not find that the male follows the precise type of the male parent, nor does the female always inherit the precise characteristics of the mother,--there is always a proportion of the female character in the male offspring, and of the male character in the female offspring. That must be quite plain to all of you who have looked at all attentively on your own children or those of your neighbours; you will have noticed how very often it may happen that the son shall exhibit the maternal type of character, or the daughter possess the characteristics of the father's family. There are all sorts of intermixtures and intermediate conditions between the two, where complexion, or beauty, or fifty other different peculiarities belonging to either side of the house, are reproduced in other members of the same family. Indeed, it is sometimes to be remarked in this kind of variation, that the variety belongs, strictly speaking, to neither of the immediate parents; you will see a child in a family who is not like either its father or its mother; but some old person who knew its grandfather or grandmother, or, it may be, an uncle, or, perhaps, even a more distant relative, will see a great similarity between the child and one of these. In this way it constantly happens that the characteristic of some previous member of the family comes out and is reproduced and recognised in the most unexpected manner.|$|E

Ninety phenotypically diverse EAHB cultivars were genotyped at 100 SSR microsatellite markers to investigate population genetic diversity, the correlation of genetic variability with morphological classes, and evolutionary origins since introduction to Africa. Population-level statistics were compared to those for plantain (AAB) and dessert (AAA) cultivars representing other M. acuminata subgroups. EAHBs displayed minimal genetic variation and are largely genetically uniform, irrespective of whether they were derived from the distinct Ugandan or Kenyan germplasm collections.

As a substitute, Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi) and then hybrids between European and Japanese larches have been preferred in these regions together with Siberian larches in northern Scandinavia. Results from intensive provenances testing (as early as in the 1940 s) have been the corner stone on which breeding programmes have developed both at the intra- (mostly in Central and Eastern Europe) and inter-specific (mostly in North-Western Europe) levels. Inter-specific hybridization is probably the most emblematic and promising breeding strategy for larch, taking benefit of both species trait complementarity, hybrid vigour (heterosis) and hybrid homeostasis. While seed orchards are now the main source for dissemination of genetic progress for European larch, mass-production of hybrid larch remains problematic either through sexual (hybridization seed orchard) or <b>asexual</b> (vegetative <b>propagation</b> by cutting) ways and still impedes large deployment of hybrids in Europe.

40|$|Introduction: Potential almond {{rootstock}} {{and thus}} main genetic {{sources for the}} breeding of its new rootstocks are almond itself, peach and plum, and these species cross-breeds Almond {{is a source of}} resistance to limestone and to drought because of its roots, which reach deep layers of soil; it is also more resistant than peach to Na and Bo. <b>Asexual</b> or vegetative <b>propagation</b> is a hereditable characteristic and this paper is a review of sources available on this character for almond rootstock breeding. The bibliographic reference regarding this species, vegetative propagation is very poor. Stem cutting is considered the most simple and economical method of propagation. It is important, particularly in horticulture for mass production of improved material within a short time and to perpetuate the characteristics of the parent plant. Materials and Methods: In this study the effects of different concentrations of indole- 3 - butyric acid (IBA) and medium type on rooting of hardwood stem cuttings of two rootstocks natural hybrids of almond × peach and the clone of G. F. 677 (as control) was investigated in plastic greenhouse with bottom heat, In this research 4 levels of IBA (0. 3000, 6000 and 9000 mg/l) and three levels of bed (perlait, cocopeat and, mixtures of 2 perlite + 1 cocopeat) on rooting of hardwood cuttings of two almond × peach natural hybrids and control was used in a split plot based on a randomized complete blocks design with three replications.

40|$|Climate {{is a major}} {{determinant}} of crop productivity. Besides its direct impact on plant growth it has a major effect on the prevalence and incidence of plant diseases. The sensitivity of pathogens to climate is pronounced. While the local climate determines the general pattern of prevailing pathogen populations, specific weather conditions are important drivers in distinct phases of the life cycles of pathogens such as dormancy and survival, <b>asexual</b> or sexual <b>propagation,</b> and infection and colonization of host plants. Knowledge about the impact of weather variables on pathogens and diseases is an important part in predictive crop protection strategies. There is considerable data available from the past 30 to 40 years on climate-disease relationships, which have been used to develop weather-based forecasting models with the aim of predicting epidemic severity to maximise economic use of pesticides. A large number of such models have been constructed for specific diseases to help farmers and advisers in making their decisions about crop protection to save unnecessary sprays. Such weather-based disease forecast models {{can also be used to}} simulate epidemic severity and/or the geographic spread of a particular pathogen under future climatic change scenarios. However, there are some important constraints in making climate change-disease projections, the first resulting from the large variability and uncertainty of current climate prediction models themselves. Further complicating factors arise from the fact that climate not only affects pathogen or pest populations directly but also induces changes in the crop production systems and cropping techniques (soil tillage, irrigation, sowing dates, cultivars, crop species) that indirectly alter the prevalence of pathogens or pests. It is difficult to separate direct from indirect climate effects. Climate change effects can be exemplified with major pathogens of oilseed rape. Greater mean temperatures may be associated with spread of phoma stem canker further north and altered temporal pattern of the fungal life cycle and disease stages in the UK. There is also some indication that sclerotinia stem rot, after mild winter conditions, may perform a pre-seasonal sclerotial stage. In addition, root infection has occurred more frequently with yet unknown relation to recent climate shifts. Yield losses from ascospore infections at early flowering stages may increase compared to late infections. Soil-borne diseases will specifically be affected by altered temperature profiles in the soils. After mild winters, V. longisporum caused greater yield losses in Germany. Clubroot has recently become a serious threat in Germany, but its relationship to recent climatic changes is still unknown. Research is needed to improve and combine climate and disease prediction models to provide a realistic forecast of disease risks associated with climate change. As climate models are likely to continue to lack sufficient accuracy, thorough surveillance of disease epidemics will be more crucial than ever before, in order to detect changes and adaptation in pathogen (and pest) populations and to establish the appropriate crop protection systems early enoug...|$|R
40|$|Toxoplasma gondii is a {{single-celled}} parasite infecting a {{wide range}} of birds and mammals worldwide. In these warm-blooded animals, it usually causes no symptoms but can cause neurological, ocular, and reproductive problems, especially if the immune system is compromised or if a mammal becomes infected while pregnant. Seroprevalence in some Inuit communities is much higher than in other parts of North America. Inuit are thought to be exposed through handling and consumption of Arctic wildlife. As T. gondii are known to produce oocysts in the intestines of felids, and wild and domestic felids are rare in the tundra regions of the Arctic, there are other transmission mechanisms occurring. Previous work has demonstrated that migratory birds are a potential source for introduction of toxoplasmosis, and that Arctic foxes are likely infected through carnivory. The aim of this research was, first, to determine major routes of transmission of T. gondii in a terrestrial Arctic ecosystem at Karrak Lake in the Queen Maud Gulf Bird Sanctuary, Nunavut, in Arctic foxes and Arctic-nesting geese. We also compared molecular and serological techniques used to detect and characterize T. gondii. Finally, reindeer were experimentally infected to determine effects and tissue distribution of the parasite. This work will address important food safety and public health aspects by looking for T. gondii in two key species, geese and caribou, which are important food sources in northern communities. Caribou populations are declining throughout the Arctic. Knowing what effects this parasite can have on caribou gives us information on whether it causes health problems or not. As for Arctic foxes, looking into seroprevalence and mode of transmission will help us understand how this parasite persists in this particular ecosystem. We hypothesize that T. gondii is maintained via vertical transmission (i. e., female foxes to the pups), in addition to transmission by carnivory. To test this hypothesis, and to determine if any changes in serostatus occurred throughout multiple years, we collected and tested blood samples from live-trapped adult and juvenile Arctic foxes. Samples were analyzed in laboratories by serological methods (Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Test (IFAT), Modified Agglutination Test (MAT)) developed and improved previously. We also tested wild goose samples serologically, using filter papers, thoracic fluids and fluids from frozen hearts, and via 2 different methods of DNA extraction followed by PCR for a 529 bp repeating segment. The magnetic capture technique allowed use of up to 100 g of tissues compared to ≤ 25 mg with traditional DNA extraction methods, thus increasing the chance to find true positives in heart and brain samples. Finally, we investigated the pathology and tissue distribution of T. gondii in experimentally infected reindeer to determine which tissues pose the greatest risk for human exposure. Our work suggests that T. gondii is present in newborn Arctic foxes, supporting the hypothesis of vertical transmission. We also proposed that subsequent litters can be infected congenitally, not just litters of females infected {{for the first time in}} pregnancy, which are pregnant females without T. gondii antibodies at the moment of infection. This can have important implications regarding reproductive success. Changes in serostatus in adult Arctic foxes throughout the years were also noticed, with a higher rate of exposure and seroconversion in mature foxes, as well as a shift of serostatus from positive to negative in an older fox. These findings give us a better understanding of how the parasite can be transmitted and maintained in a terrestrial Arctic ecosystem. Magnetic capture succeeded in detecting higher levels of T. gondii in reindeer tissues than traditional DNA extraction, suggesting the use of this technique when large amount of tissues are available. Toxoplasma gondii was not detected in wild goose tissues (i. e., brain, heart) following conventional PCR and sequencing, possibly due to low infection rates in Ross’s and Lesser Snow Geese, and low sensitivity of the conventional PCR. Antibodies against T. gondii were found serologically in both goose species using body fluids, but not following a chloroform clean-up centrifugation on the samples used to remove fat particles. The quality of samples at the time of serological testing as well as the type of samples (body fluids instead of serum) could explain the negative results after using the chloroform centrifugation. We successfully performed MAT for the first time in the field, suggesting that the use of this technique in remote field areas and northern communities is feasible. Finally, T. gondii was successfully detected in commonly consumed muscles of experimentally infected reindeer. This result gives us important insight on a potential mechanism for food-borne transmission of T. gondii in northern communities and raises concern regarding the safety of caribou meat in naturally infected animals. Subtle behavioral changes were observed in reindeer after infection, as well as respiratory problems in one animal. Numerous studies have demonstrated that T. gondii is capable of vertical transmission in a variety of hosts, including humans. High prevalences of the parasite in host populations that are geographically isolated from definitive felid hosts, as is the case in arctic fox populations, are intriguing scenarios to explore the importance of vertical transmission. It may also help to explain the extent of genetic diversity and the relative roles of sexual recombination (oocysts) vs clonal <b>propagation</b> (<b>asexual</b> reproduction). Moreover, using seroprevalence studies, Arctic foxes can be used as sentinels for T. gondii in this specific ecosystem. This research will provide information about how Arctic peoples become exposed through important food sources (i. e., geese and caribou) and the health effects of toxoplasmosis in threatened wildlife. We need more information on the significance of food-borne routes of transmission of T. gondii in the North in order to implement culturally appropriate and effective local prevention measures...|$|R
