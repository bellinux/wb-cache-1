40|$|Ta {{films were}} {{sputtered}} onto a glass substrate with thicknesses from 500 [*]Å to 1500 [*]Å under the following conditions: (a) <b>as-deposited</b> films were maintained {{at room temperature}} (RT), (b) films were postannealed at TA= 150 °C for 1 [*]h, and (c) films were postannealed at TA= 250 °C for 1 [*]h. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results revealed that the Ta films had a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure. Postannealing conditions and thicker Ta films exhibited a stronger Ta (110) crystallization than <b>as-deposited</b> and thinner films. The nanoindention results revealed that Ta thin films are sensitive to mean grain size, including a valuable hardness (H) and Young’s modulus (E). High nanomechanical properties of <b>as-deposited</b> and thinner films can be investigated by grain refinement, {{which is consistent with}} the Hall-Petch effect. The surface energy of <b>as-deposited</b> Ta films was higher than that in postannealing treatments. The adhesion of <b>as-deposited</b> Ta films was stronger than postannealing treatments because of crystalline degree effect. The maximal H and E and the optimal adhesion of an <b>as-deposited</b> 500 -Å-thick Ta film were 15. 6 [*]GPa, 180 [*]GPa, and 51. 56 [*]mJ/mm 2, respectively, suggesting that a 500 -Å-thick Ta thin film can be used in seed and protective layer applications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The fabrication, {{physical}} and electrochemical properties of copper silicon alloy film were systematically studied and the optimized preparation conditions were obtained.

The {{thickness of the}} films was 200 nm, measured with a quartz crystal thickness monitor in the growth chamber. X-rays diffraction (XRD) {{was used to determine}} the structure of the films.

40|$|Thin {{films of}} {{tantalum}} oxide were formed on quartz and silicon (111) substrates kept {{at room temperature}} (303 [*]K) by reactive sputtering of tantalum target {{in the presence of}} mixture of oxygen and argon gases. The <b>as-deposited</b> films were annealed in air for an hour in the temperature range 673 – 873 [*]K. The films were characterized by studying structural, dielectric, electrical, and optical properties. The <b>as-deposited</b> films were amorphous in nature. As the annealing temperature increased to 673 [*]K, the films were transformed into polycrystalline. Electrical characteristics of <b>as-deposited</b> and annealed Ta 2 O 5 thin films were compared. The thermal annealing reduced the leakage current density and increased the dielectric constant. The optical transmittance of the films increased with the increase of annealing temperature. The <b>as-deposited</b> films showed the optical band gap of 4. 38 [*]eV. It increased to 4. 44 [*]eV with the increase of annealing temperature to 873 [*]K. The <b>as-deposited</b> films showed the low value (1. 89) of refractive index and it increased to 2. 15 when annealed at 873 [*]K. The increase of refractive index with annealing temperature was due to the increase in the packing density and crystallinity of the films...|$|E
40|$|Tin-oxide and {{graphene}} (TG) composites were fabricated {{using the}} Electrostatic Spray Deposition (ESD) technique, and tested as anode materials for Li-ion batteries. The electrochemical {{performance of the}} <b>as-deposited</b> TG composites were compared to heat-treated TG composites along with pure tin-oxide films. The heat-treated composites exhibited superior specific capacity and energy density than both the <b>as-deposited</b> TG composites and tin oxide samples. At the 70 th cycle, the specific capacities of the <b>as-deposited</b> and post heat-treated samples were 534 and 737 mA·h/g, respectively, and the corresponding energy densities of the <b>as-deposited</b> and heat-treated composites were 1240 and 1760 W·h/kg, respectively. This improvement in the electrochemical performance of the TG composite anodes {{as compared to the}} pure tin oxide samples is attributed to the synergy between tin oxide and graphene, which increases the electrical conductivity of tin oxide and helps alleviate volumetric changes in tin-oxide during cycling...|$|E
40|$|Spray Forming is an {{advanced}} materials processing technology that transforms molten metal into a near-net-shape solid by depositing atomized droplets onto a substrate. Depending on the application, the spray-formed material {{may be used}} in the <b>as-deposited</b> condition or it may undergo post-deposition processing. Regardless, the density of the <b>as-deposited</b> material is an important issue. Porosity is detrimental because it can significantly reduce strength, toughness, hardness and other properties. While it is not feasible to achieve fully-dense material in the <b>as-deposited</b> state, density greater than 99 % of theoretical density is possible if the atomization and impact conditions are optimized. Thermal conditions at the deposit surface and droplet impact angle are key processing parameters that influence the density of the material. This paper examines the factors that contribute to porosity formation during spray forming and illustrates that very high <b>as-deposited</b> density is achieved by optimizing processing parameters...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} CdTe thin films were {{deposited}} by close-spaced sublimation (CSS) in an oxygen ambient {{and the influence}} of oxygen on the properties of <b>as-deposited</b> and chlorine activated CdTe microstructures were investigated. FE-SEM imaging of ion-polished cross sections of the <b>as-deposited</b> CdTe-layers revealed a significant change from a block-like to a columnar microstructure with increasing oxygen concentration in the gas flux. After the chlorine activation step at 440 °C the oxygen free sample shows a strong sulfur diffusion whereas samples with low oxygen inlet show a suppressed diffusion. Due to the enlarged amount of grain boundaries in the <b>as-deposited</b> microstructure the sulfur diffusion became stronger again with increasing oxygen concentration...|$|E

The local distortion is analyzed {{in terms of}} three contributions: static, phonon, and an extra, temperature-dependent, polaron term. The polaron distortion is very small for the <b>as-deposited</b> sample and increases with the annealing temperature. In contrast, the static distortion in the samples decreases with the annealing temperature. Although the local structure of the <b>as-deposited</b> sample shows very little temperature dependence, the change in resistivity with temperature is the largest of these three thin film samples. The <b>as-deposited</b> sample also has the highest magnetoresistance (MR), which indicates some other mechanism may {{also contribute to the}} transport properties of CMR samples. We also discuss the relationship between local distortion and the magnetization of the sample. Comment: 11 pages of Preprint format, 8 figures in one tar fil...|$|E
40|$|Nickel-oxide-based films exhibiting {{antibacterial}} activity against both Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus atrophaeus) have been fabricated by electrodeposition from aqueous solutions. However, after annealing of the films, no {{antibacterial activity}} has been observed. <b>As-deposited</b> films {{were found to}} consist of a mixture of nickel-oxide hydroxide and nickel hydroxide, while annealing resulted in {{the conversion of the}} films into pure NiO. Also, annealed films exhibited no production of H 2 O 2, unlike <b>as-deposited</b> films. Thus, antibacterial activity of <b>as-deposited</b> films is related to the presence of nickel-oxide hydroxide/nickel hydroxide which results in the production of reactive oxygen species and antibacterial activity. © 2009 Elsevier B.
