2500|$|The [...] was {{produced}} from 1971 to 1990. It featured an undersquare [...] bore and [...] stroke; it was otherwise {{similar to the}} 199 and 232. This engine is considered reliable, inexpensive, and torquey.

This engine also found some use in farm/industrial applications such as the International Harvester 4000 swather.|$|E

Shown standing upright, small anthropomorphic figurines are carved in high relief around the chest and arms. Coir bindings along the <b>arm</b> <b>cover</b> remains of a cloth and feathers that would have once been worn by the deity.

Only one other similar figure from the George Ortiz collection is known.|$|E

50|$|On April 2, 2011, as {{the damaged}} DenLiner returns, Shocker initiates its mass {{extermination}} as Kamen Rider OOO fights them off before seeing the train. Assuming Tajadol Combo, Kamen Rider OOO takes Mitsuru to safety as Kotaro, Momotaros, and Ankh {{jump out of}} the train as it explodes. Losing his OOO Driver in the explosion, Eiji realizes that the DenLiner crew have failed in their mission and the train's destruction means the event cannot be undone. Soon after, Eiji and Kotaro are captured as Ankh and Momotaros (reduced to a floating left <b>arm)</b> <b>cover</b> everyone's escape. Arriving at the kids' spare hideout, the group soon find Teddy in his Macheteddy form as a grave marker along with a time capsule.

Surrounded by Shocker soldiers, Momotaros takes over Shingo's body and uses the Macheteddy to keep them busy while Hina and the children run off with the OOO Driver. However, M-Ankh is captured as well and is taken with Eiji and Kotaro for public execution.|$|E

5000|$|Penfield {{referred}} to his creations as [...] "grotesque creatures" [...] due to their strange-looking proportions. For example, the sensory nerves arriving from the hands terminate over {{large areas of the}} brain, resulting {{in the hands of the}} homunculus being correspondingly large. In contrast, the nerves emanating from the torso or <b>arms</b> <b>cover</b> a much smaller area, thus the torso and arms of the homunculus look comparatively small and weak.|$|R
5000|$|This is also {{sometimes}} known as Rubbergate (from the expressions [...] "rubber check" [...] (bounced check) and [...] "Watergate)".

Behind him, the body and straps of a portable shrine are just visible. Heroes and their foes disguising themselves as pilgrims is a popular kabuki motif.

2500|$|The pose is {{reminiscent}} of several earlier works by Rembrandt, including an etching from 1639, Self-Portrait Leaning on a Stone Sill, and a painted self-portrait of 1640, now in the National Gallery in London. Both earlier pieces have been viewed as referential to the Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione (Louvre) by Raphael, as well as A Man with a Quilted Sleeve [...] by Titian (NG, London), then wrongly {{thought to be a}} portrait of Ludovico Ariosto, which Rembrandt had seen in Amsterdam.
