40|$|Thesis (MTech(Public Management)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2006 One of the {{challenges}} facing the South African community is the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The epidemic not only disrupts the economy but one of its emerging impacts is through {{the children who are}} left orphaned. The challenge has come at a time when economic circumstances are making it difficult for extended families to lend a helping hand to children who are orphaned as a result of HIV/AIDS. The children left behind are usually left on their own or are absorbed through care <b>and</b> <b>support</b> centres which are being becoming popular. The challenge of these care <b>and</b> <b>support</b> centres has come at a time when an increase in abuse by the personnel of care <b>and</b> <b>support</b> centres has emerged internationally. Communities can no longer {{turn a blind eye to}} the atrocities that are being experienced by the children within these centres. This challenge is double edged as communities feel isolated by the care <b>and</b> <b>support</b> centres which are based within their communities. The challenge is how communities can breach the gap between children within care <b>and</b> <b>support</b> centres <b>and</b> children who are left on their own. The care <b>and</b> <b>support</b> centres available for HIV/AIDS orphans in Khayelitsha are predominantly run by foreign donors, which limit community participation. This has led to the isolation of community members <b>and</b> care <b>and</b> <b>support</b> centre staff <b>and</b> the core problem of this study will address the evaluation of the care <b>and</b> <b>support</b> centres. Questions such as what happens to children's properties after their parents' death, and do they belong in care <b>and</b> <b>support</b> centres or within their communities arise. These are the areas which will be scrutinized in the study. Areas in which this thesis will attempt to provide insights and make concrete recommendations. Simultaneously with the extensive exploration of care <b>and</b> <b>support</b> centres available for HIV/AIDS orphans theories include the : • Available care <b>and</b> <b>support</b> centres • Community participation within care <b>and</b> <b>support</b> centres • The concept of "ubuntu' in relation to family existence It is hoped that the focus on the care <b>and</b> <b>support</b> centres available for HIV/AIDS orphans will make some contribution to effective care <b>and</b> <b>support</b> centres in this areas, thereby increasing community participation which in turn will revive the concept of ubuntu within communities. Finally, recommendations such as the direct involvement of community members is required to attain which services the care <b>and</b> <b>support</b> centres can offer to the community and how the community play an active role within care <b>and</b> <b>support</b> centres will be offered in this thesis, as informed by the survey results, to effectively manage care <b>and</b> <b>support</b> centres for HIV/AIDS orphans in Khayelitsha...|$|R
