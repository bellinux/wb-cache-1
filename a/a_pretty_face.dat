500|$|Zeta-Jones' first {{release of}} 1999 was the heist film Entrapment, {{in which she}} starred {{opposite}} Sean Connery as a seductive insurance agent {{on the lookout for}} an art thief. Despite a negative critical reception, the film was a commercial success; Janet Maslin of The New York Times thought that the film provided Zeta-Jones a platform to [...] "show off her slithery skills", and Desson Howe of The Washington Post called on viewers to appreciate the sex appeal she brought to the role. Later that year, Zeta-Jones appeared alongside Liam Neeson and Lili Taylor in The Haunting, a remake of the 1963 film of the same name about a team of paranormal experts who look into strange occurrences in an ill-fated mansion. The horror feature received generally poor reviews but found a significant worldwide audience. In a scathing review, the critic Mick LaSalle wrote that [...] "Zeta-Jones seems less an actress and more <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>face,</b> and not an interesting one at that".|$|E

500|$|Dismayed {{at being}} typecast as the token pretty girl in British films, Zeta-Jones {{relocated}} to Los Angeles. She remarked, [...] "There {{was all this}} fuss about who I was and wasn't dating. I was <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>face</b> and a big bust and nothing else. People in the business believed what they read about me. So I decided to move away and start again." [...] She believed that the anonymity she faced in America helped her get roles on merit and not due to her public image. She earned the part of Sala, the hench-woman to the villainous Drax (Treat Williams) in the superhero film The Phantom (1996), starring Billy Zane in the titular role. A reviewer for Variety considered Zeta-Jones to be a standout in her part, but the film received a negative critical reception and earned little at the box office. The CBS television miniseries Titanic (1996), however, was better received. Starring opposite Peter Gallagher and George C. Scott, she portrayed the lead role of Isabella Paradine, a young mother engaged in an extramarital affair on the [...]|$|E
500|$|In {{the period}} drama The Girl of Your Dreams (La niña de tus ojos), Cruz portrayed Macarena Granada, a singer {{who is in}} an on-and-off {{relationship}} with Antonio Resines's character, Blas. They {{are part of a}} Francoist film troupe that travels from Spain during the Spanish Civil War to Nazi Germany for a joint production with UFA. Cruz's performance in the film was praised by film critics, with Jonathan Holloland of Variety magazine writing [...] "if confirmation is still needed that Cruz is an actress first and <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>face</b> second, then here it is". A writer for Film4 commented that [...] "Cruz herself is the inevitable focus of the film" [...] but noted that overall the film [...] "looks great". Cruz's role as Macerna has been viewed as her [...] "largest role to date". For her performance, Cruz received a Goya Award and Spanish Actors' Union Award, and was nominated for a European Film Award. In 1999, Cruz worked with Almodóvar again in All About My Mother, playing Sister María Rosa Sanz, a pregnant nun with AIDS. The film received favorable reviews, and was commercially successful, grossing over $67million worldwide, although it performed better at the box office internationally than domestically.|$|E
500|$|On February 12, 2012, Lil' Wayne {{said that}} Christina Milian had joined Young Money, and will release her fourth album through Young Money Entertainment. The next day, a song titled [...] "Mr. Valentine" [...] leaked onto the internet. Milian told Carson Daly on 97.1 AMP Radio. [...] "Yeah, I've signed with Young Money. It was pretty awesome. This weekend {{we had a}} big party, a big YMCMB party, and Drake was {{performing}} and we were all up on the stage and Wayne got up there and he announced it himself. And so I was kind of surprised and I was like, 'Oh my gosh, this is awesome!'" [...] Milian is currently recording her fourth album. [...] "We're just getting started on it," [...] she said. [...] "I've already halfway gotten there and when my mom and I went to Wayne and we played him some of the music, off the second song, he was like, 'I love it. Let's do this deal.' I have some music that's already going to be on it and the second half I'm working with them now. [...] When they did a little background check, they saw even the songwriting, {{all that kind of stuff}} adds on top of, alright, she's an actress, she's <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>face,</b> she can actually sing, but not to mention she's a songwriter. I thought that was cool that they even saw that. [...] They all get on each other's records, so all I have to do is be home with everybody and we'll just do lots of features." ...|$|E

Klepacki has declared pop music as having become the [...] "largest farce in music history—soul-less, mechanical, and only {{made for the}} sole purpose of making the fastest dollar possible, with more emphasis on imagery than the music." [...] He's also criticized lip-synching and the repackaging of music genre through different labels—such as Nu metal for rock music and Neo soul for soul music. He believes that signing a deal does not guarantee profits, and would rather keep his day job as audio director. These sentiments were echoed in a special feature on the band Home Cookin' in 2000—Klepacki said the group wanted to [...] "work with a label, not for them." [...] Stating that he would not compromise his work for popularity, he believes that [...] "the only artists that have any longevity are the ones that pioneer a movement—not follow one." [...] He enjoys working independently, as he does not have to [...] "change...music for the sake of pop radio." [...] He champions the internet as a medium through which creative and original artists can be found. Klepacki believes it is the preferred avenue for music when compared to radio airplay—where one hears [...] "the exact same songs 3 months at a time." [...] When interviewed about file-sharing, he expressed mixed emotions. Holding that compact discs are [...] "just too damn expensive", Klepacki believes that a few dollars' reduction in price would [...] "deter people from downloading for free." [...] Conversely, he notes that artists—who [...] "don't get as much money as you think"—need to be compensated for their work. His favorite artists by decade, starting with the 1960s, are Sly and the Family Stone, Graham Central Station, Metallica, Home Cookin', and Bob Schneider.|$|E
500|$|Pfeiffer {{has long}} been {{referred}} to {{as one of the most}} beautiful actresses in Hollywood, a designation The Daily Telegraph Mick Brown considers to be both [...] "a defining characteristic in her acting career" [...] and [...] "a curse". Pfeiffer initially struggled to convince casting agents and directors to take her seriously as an actress because they perceived her as little more than <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>face</b> during the early stages of her career. Pfeiffer's acting abilities continued to be overshadowed by her beauty even several years after her breakout performance in Scarface (1983); she responded by pursuing roles in which being blond is not a requirement. The Daily Beast Elizabeth Kaye recognized Pfeiffer among Hollywood's rare [...] "beautiful women" [...] who trust that it is possible to be physically beautiful and serious simultaneously. Kaye believes that the actress achieves this feat by [...] "grafting the sensibility of a modern woman onto the glamour of a '30s icon"; Rolling Stones Gerri Hirshey agreed that Pfeiffer's roles combine [...] "Nineties guts and Thirties glamour." [...] For Interview magazine, Peter Stone described Pfeiffer as a [...] "Blond, sultry, and ethereal" [...] actress with an [...] "unforgettable" [...] face. Nisha Lilia Diu, another The Daily Telegraph contributor, opined, [...] "It's not that she looks younger than she is – she doesn't particularly – it's the symmetry of her bone structure, the flashing aquamarine eyes and those lips, the top one so much fuller than the bottom. It's the kind of beauty you find yourself involuntarily taking a moment to marvel at mid-conversation." [...] At least two of Pfeiffer's films, Stardust (2007) and Chéri (2009), in which she plays a 5, 000 year old witch obsessed with beauty and a courtesan fading into obscurity, respectively, explore themes of beautiful women struggling with the idea of aging. Pfeiffer personally identified with the topic of [...] "our obsession with youth and the ludicrous degrees to which women will go to reclaim it" [...] portrayed in the films. Pfeiffer claims to not want to appear younger than she is and has yet to undergo plastic surgery, although she admits she would [...] "never say never" [...] to the procedure. Dismissing the claim that she is [...] "drop dead gorgeous", insisting that she is only [...] "conventionally pretty". Pfeiffer has been famously self-deprecating about her own appearance, comparing herself to Howard the Duck.|$|E
500|$|Teetotal and a non-smoker, O'Hara {{rejected}} the Hollywood party lifestyle, and was relatively moderate in her personal grooming. In her earlier career {{she refused to}} appear to smoke and drink on screen, {{and it was only}} later that she relented to avoid being out of a job. O'Hara was considered to be prudish in Hollywood. Malone wrote that [...] "her attitude towards sex bordered on puritanical at times, which wasn't what one expected from a sex symbol". When asked why she would not pose for scantily clad photographs O'Hara remarked: [...] "I come from a very strict family, and I can't do some of the things other actresses can because my folks in Dublin would think I turned out bad", and in 1948 she stated that she wouldn't be photographed in a bathing suit [...] "Because I don't think I looked like Lana Turner in a bathing suit, frankly. O'Hara later commented that [...] "I'm not prudish but my training was strict". She believed that her squeaky-clean lifestyle took its toll on her career. She once said, [...] "I'm a helpless victim of a Hollywood whispering campaign. Because I don't let the producer and director kiss me every morning or let them paw me they have spread around town that I am not a woman, that I am a cold piece of marble statuary" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't throw myself on the casting couch, and I know that cost me parts. I wasn't going to play the whore. That wasn't me". She vented her frustration on not being given edgier roles in an interview with The Los Angeles Times, saying [...] "Producers look at <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>face</b> and think: 'She must have got this far on her looks'. Then comes along a girl with a plain face and they think, 'She must be a great actress, she isn't pretty'. So they give her the glamour treatment and the pretty girl gets left behind". O'Hara believed that she missed out on a number of roles in some of the classic black and white films because she aesthetically pictured so well in Technicolor productions. Such was her natural beauty that {{she was one of the}} few actresses in Hollywood during her career to not undergo cosmetic surgery, though she had one crooked tooth which she refused to part with.|$|E

2500|$|In 1978, Lear {{continued}} her line of disco hits with Sweet Revenge, an album that {{opens with a}} concept medley about a Faustian fairy tale of a girl who sells her soul to the devil for fame and fortune and in her eventual revenge over the devil's offer finds true love. The first single from Sweet Revenge, [...] "Follow Me", powered by Lear's characteristic deep and recitative voice and {{the theme of the}} devil, was an instant smash hit. It reached the Top 3 in the West German singles chart as well as Top 10 in many European countries, and has been Lear's signature tune ever since. The Sweet Revenge album was certified gold in West Germany, France, Italy and Belgium and went on to sell in excess of four million copies, spawning further European hit singles [...] "Gold" [...] and [...] "Run Baby Run" [...] from the concept medley, as well as [...] "Enigma (Give a Bit of Mmh to Me)". Lear took part in three Italian productions in 1978: a war-time parody Zio Adolfo in arte Führer, a softporn documentary movie Follie di notte, directed by Joe D'Amato, and a six-episode controversial TV show Stryx. Later in 1978 Lear and Monn teamed up for Never Trust <b>a</b> <b>Pretty</b> <b>Face.</b> The album featured a variety of genre exercises like the dance version of a war-time classic [...] "Lili Marleen", the interpersonal ballad [...] "The Sphinx", the cabaret-esque [...] "Miroir", futuristic tracks [...] "Black Holes" [...] and [...] "Intellectually", as well as the hit disco single [...] "Fashion Pack (Studio 54)". In 1979, Amanda had her first art exhibition in Paris and on 13 March in Las Vegas married bisexual French aristocrat Alain-Philippe Malagnac d'Argens de Villèle, the former lover and then adopted son of a diplomat and controversial gay novelist Roger Peyrefitte. The couple had first met late in 1978 at a fashionable Parisian discothèque Le Palace, a French equivalent of Studio 54. Dalí and his wife Gala both strongly disapproved of this relationship and even attempted to persuade Lear to have the marriage annulled. As a consequence of this, and also the time taken up by Lear's successful career in music and television, she and her mentor began drifting apart. They still sporadically kept in touch via letters and telephone through the early and mid-1980s, especially after Gala's death in 1982. Lear visited Dalí one last time at Púbol, Spain a few years before the painter himself died.|$|E

60|$|When {{she threw}} off her veil and hat, you saw <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> enough <b>face,</b> now flushed and {{disturbed}} by some unusual emotion, and restless, large eyes with discontent marring their brightness.

However, I don't think that young lady is of the sort to care about a coward, and if she asks any questions, as I dare say she will, after what I have said, she will find that the story is a true one. What <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> little thing she is! I did not see <b>a</b> <b>prettier</b> <b>face</b> all the time I was at home.
