5|$|In {{addition}} to Sappho's accomplishments, literary historian Jeannette Howard Foster includes the Book of Ruth, and ancient mythological tradition <b>as</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> lesbianism in classical literature. Greek {{stories of the}} heavens often included a female figure whose virtue and virginity were unspoiled, who pursued more masculine interests, and who {{was followed by a}} dedicated group of maidens. Foster cites Camilla and Diana, Artemis and Callisto, and Iphis and Ianthe <b>as</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> female mythological figures who showed remarkable devotion to each other, or defied gender expectations. The Greeks are also given credit with spreading the story of a mythological race of women warriors named Amazons. En-hedu-ana, a priestess in Ancient Iraq who dedicated herself to the Sumerian goddess Inanna, has the distinction of signing the oldest-surviving signed poetry in history. She characterized herself as Inanna's spouse.|$|E

5|$|The {{architecture}} of Leeds, {{a city and}} metropolitan borough in West Yorkshire, England, encompasses {{a wide range of}} architectural styles and notable buildings. As with most northern industrial centres, much of Leeds' prominent architecture is of the Victorian era. However, the City of Leeds also contains buildings from as early as the Middle Ages such as Kirkstall Abbey, one of Britain's best preserved ruined Cistercian monasteries, as well <b>as</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> 20th century industrial architecture, particularly in the districts of Hunslet and Holbeck.|$|E
5|$|Bede wrote Ecgbert {{a letter}} dealing with monastic {{issues as well}} as the {{problems}} of large dioceses. The letter, written in 734, became known as the Epistola ad Ecgberhtum episcopum. Bede urged Ecgbert to study Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care, and held up Aidan and Cuthbert <b>as</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> model bishops. The main thrust of Bede's letter was to urge Ecgbert to reform his church to more closely resemble Gregory the Great's original plan for it. Bede's admonition to divide up dioceses fell on deaf ears, as Egbert did not break up his large diocese. The suffragans continued to be limited to the bishops of Hexham, Lindisfarne, and Whithorn.|$|E
5|$|During February and March 1942, the RAAF formed four {{transport}} units: Nos.33, 34, 35 and 36Squadrons. No.36 Squadron {{was established}} on 11March at RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, {{under the control}} of Southern Area Command. Its initial strength was twenty-six personnel and one Douglas DC-2. This was gradually built up to a force of six DC-2s, as well <b>as</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> various de Havilland types including the DH.84 Dragon, DH.86 Express, DH.89 Dragon Rapide, and Tiger Moth. Tasked with transport operations throughout Australia and to Port Moresby, New Guinea, the squadron relocated to Essendon, Victoria, on 17July. One of the DC-2s crashed at Seven Mile Aerodrome, Port Moresby, on 14September; all aboard were killed. The squadron was transferred to Townsville, Queensland, on 11December 1942. During 1943, it maintained detachments at Essendon and in New Guinea, and began re-equipping with twelve Douglas C-47 Dakotas.|$|E

5|$|Hilda Ellis Davidson counts Þorgerðr and Irpa <b>as</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> {{guardian}} goddesses in Germanic paganism, {{and compares}} their roles {{to that of}} the dísir and valkyries. Davidson says that if Helgi is the mythical founder of Hålogaland, it would explain Þorgerðr's last name ("bride of Helgi") and that, subsequently, she would be the wife of each ruler of the kingdom in turn. Substantially the same argument has been advanced by McKinnell. Davidson compares this role to accounts of kings or leaders being granted entry into Valhalla in the Viking Age, that the idea of a guardian goddess welcoming kings was essentially an aristocratic concept, and that a tradition such as this could explain noble valkyries welcoming dead kings into the after life, using the poem Hákonarmál as an example.|$|E
5|$|Hoysala {{architecture}} is the building style developed {{under the rule}} of the Hoysala Empire between the 11th and 14th centuries, in the region known today as Karnataka, a state of India. Hoysala influence was at its peak in the 13th century, when it dominated the Southern Deccan Plateau region. Large and small temples built during this era remain <b>as</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> the Hoysala architectural style, including the Chennakesava Temple at Belur, the Hoysaleswara Temple at Halebidu, and the Kesava Temple at Somanathapura. Other examples of Hoysala craftsmanship are the temples at Belavadi, Amruthapura, Hosaholalu, Mosale, Arasikere, Basaralu, Kikkeri and Nuggehalli. Study of the Hoysala architectural style has revealed a negligible Indo-Aryan influence while the impact of Southern Indian style is more distinct.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle Ages, Proba and {{her work}} were praised <b>as</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> scholarship. Petrarch implicitly {{referenced}} De laudibus Christi in a letter discussing female geniuses, and in 1374 Giovanni Boccaccio included Proba in his biographical collection of historical and mythological women entitled De mulieribus claris. In 1474, the poem was published by the Swiss printer Michael Wenssler, which likely made Proba the first female author to have had her work reproduced by a printing press. During the Renaissance, Cento Vergilianus de laudibus Christi was printed many times (for instance, Italian scholar Filippo Ermini lists seven incunabula and fourteen 16th-century editions of the poem), and Proba's poem was openly admired by thinkers like John Colet and Maffeo Vegio.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the major}} {{applications}} of sintered silicon nitride is in automobile industry as a material for engine parts. Those include, in diesel engines, glowplugs for faster start-up; precombustion chambers (swirl chambers) for lower emissions, faster start-up and lower noise; turbocharger for reduced engine lag and emissions. In spark-ignition engines, silicon nitride is used for rocker arm pads for lower wear, turbocharger for lower inertia and less engine lag, and in exhaust gas control valves for increased acceleration. <b>As</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> production levels, there is an estimated more than 300,000 sintered silicon nitride turbochargers made annually.|$|E
5|$|Plasmid {{stabilising}} toxin-antitoxin {{systems have}} been used <b>as</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> selfish DNA {{as part of the}} gene centered view of evolution. It has been theorised that toxin-antitoxin loci serve only to maintain their own DNA, {{at the expense of the}} host organism. Other theories propose the systems have evolved to increase the fitness of plasmids in competition with other plasmids. Thus, the toxin-antitoxin system confers an advantage to the host DNA by eliminating competing plasmids in cell progeny. This theory was corroborated through computer modelling. This does not, however, explain the presence of toxin-antitoxin systems on chromosomes.|$|E

SN 2006jc, some 77 million light years away in UGC 4904, in the constellation Lynx, also underwent a supernova impostor brightening in 2004, followed by a magnitude 13.8 type Ib supernova, first seen on 9 October 2006.
