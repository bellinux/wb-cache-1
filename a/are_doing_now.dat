2500|$|Jordan kept a diary {{during his}} service in France. [...] On March 1, 1918, {{five days before}} he was killed, Jordan wrote in his diary: [...] "I do not {{want you to think}} for a moment that I am taking this thing entirely light-mindedly. [...] No, not at all, but my {{attitude}} is this: Do the best you can and know how and then keep on smiling." [...] On March 2, 1918, he made his last entry: [...] "This fighting [...] we <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>now</b> is the real thing. [...] A man gets to be quite a fatalist in this game. [...] If somehow or other they get me -— all well and good. If not —- still better. But somehow I feel safe." ...|$|E
2500|$|The debate {{likewise}} covered {{an upcoming}} {{vote on the}} use of coercive interrogation methods on enemy combatants. Allen stated that he had not yet made a decision on how to vote, but stated [...] "Now, the key {{in all of this is}} I don’t want to stop these interrogations. I’m not for torture, I’m not for waterboarding, but some of these techniques have been very helpful to us, whether they are sleep deprivation, or whether there’s loud music. And I need to be absolutely certain that what the interrogations — interrogators <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>now</b> — which is completely fine as far as I’m concerned, protecting Americans — will not be harmed by the proposal." [...] Webb expressed that this was an issue close to him as a former soldier, but also stated that he did not believe interrogations should be ended completely. Webb however reaffirmed his concerns that if the U.S. abandons the Geneva Convention its soldiers will suffer abroad.|$|E
2500|$|Three {{years after}} the {{documentary}} that made them famous, a different documentary crew revisits the office {{to see what the}} staff members <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>now.</b> After being made redundant from Wernham Hogg, David Brent (Ricky Gervais) is now a travelling salesman who, following a failed single release of a cover of [...] "If You Don't Know Me By Now," [...] leeches off what little fame he has in a series of demeaning nightclub appearances alongside a crowd of minor celebrities. Dawn Tinsley (Lucy Davis) lives in Florida, trapped in a miserable existence with fiancé Lee (Joel Beckett), who is bouncing from job to job as they live with his sister rent-free and hidden from immigration authorities. In the office, Gareth Keenan (Mackenzie Crook) is now the general manager and Tim Canterbury (Martin Freeman) is still trapped in a job he hates with an obnoxious, pregnant desk-mate Anne (Elizabeth Berrington). Despite leaving Wernham Hogg three years ago, Brent still visits the office to see the staff and [...] "keep up the morale". This does not sit well with Gareth or David's former boss Neil Godwin (Patrick Baladi), and it appears to the viewer that Brent misses his old job. When the programme makers offer to fly Dawn and Lee back for the office Christmas party, along with the appearance of David Brent, the scene is set for a reunion.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2013, {{statements}} made by Morsi in 2010, gained wide attention in the Western media, following a report in Forbes magazine on 11 January that criticized big media outlets for having ignored it. In videos posted by MEMRI, Morsi had declared [...] "The Zionists {{have no right to}} the land of Palestine. There is no place for them on the land of Palestine. What they took before 1947–48 constitutes plunder, and what they <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>now</b> is a continuation of this plundering. By no means do we recognize their Green Line. The land of Palestine belongs to the Palestinians, not to the Zionists." [...] In September 2010, calling the Israelis [...] "blood-suckers", [...] "warmongers" [...] and [...] "descendants of apes and pigs", Morsi said [...] "These futile [...] negotiations are {{a waste of time and}} opportunities. The Zionists buy time and gain more opportunities, as the Palestinians, the Arabs, and the Muslims lose time and opportunities, and they get nothing out of it. We can see how this dream has dissipated. This dream has always been an illusion... This [...] Authority was created by the Zionist and American enemies for the sole purpose of opposing the will of the Palestinian people and its interests." [...] White House spokesman Jay Carney tried to downplay Morsi's remarks, saying that U.S. policy is focused on actions, not words. Morsi later contended that his remarks were [...] "taken out of context", and his exchange with a delegation headed by John McCain was made public: ...|$|E
