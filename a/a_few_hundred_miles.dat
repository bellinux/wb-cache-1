5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September 17. It moved across the shear-ridden Atlantic Ocean without development, and remained disorganized until reaching the western Caribbean Sea on September 26. There, the wave situated itself beneath an upper-level anticyclone, allowing for favorable upper-level outflow and for deep convection to develop. On the September 27, a low pressure area developed while the system was located <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> to the east of the Yucatán Peninsula. The system continued to organize, and nearly developed into a tropical depression before moving ashore on the Yucatán Peninsula on September 29.|$|E

It was upgraded to a tropical storm late that evening. This marked the third time that the 'P' name {{had been used to}} name an Atlantic storm since alphabetical naming began in 1950. The previous times were for Pablo in 1995 and Peter in 2003. In subsequent seasons, 'P' names would be given to Paloma in 2008, Paula in 2010, Philippe in 2011, and Patty in 2012.|$|E
5|$|On September 21, a {{tropical}} wave – a trough of relatively low atmospheric pressure – began moving slowly westward {{from the west}} coast of Africa, passing near the Cape Verde islands on September 23. Though the wave was disorganized, a low-level circulation developed on September 24 <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> to the southwest of Cape Verde. Steady organization ensued, including the development of convection into curved bands around the system. Though it lacked a well-defined center, the system organized enough to be classified Tropical Depression Sixteen on September 25 while located about 920mi (1,480km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde Islands.|$|E

5|$|An area of squally {{weather was}} first noted <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> {{east of the}} Lesser Antilles on September 18. The {{convective}} area organized into a tropical depression near the north coast of Hispaniola on September 20. After moving west-northwestward for a day, it turned northeastward, where upper level winds were very favorable and steering currents were very weak. On September 22 Gracie was named as a tropical depression before it developed into Tropical Storm Gracie, followed by reaching hurricane strength later that night. It turned to the east on September 25, and turned back west to west-northwest on September 27 as a stable anticyclone built in to its north.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Aletta was a weak but {{destructive}} {{tropical storm}} that killed 308people while meandering {{off the coast}} of Central America in May 1982. An area of disturbed weather developed into a tropical depression on May20, and into a tropical storm around noon on May21. The cyclone turned northeast, reaching its peak as a strong tropical storm on May23. Aletta meandered and gradually weakened, dissipating <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> southwest of Acapulco on May29. Moisture from the tropical system spread over Honduras and Nicaragua, causing flooding. Throughout the two countries, 308people were killed and total damage was at $457million (1982USD). In the aftermath of the storm, many programs provided relief to the victims of Aletta.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{cloudiness}} and rainshowers developed {{several hundred}} miles east-southeast of Bermuda on August 25, likely {{in association with}} a low-level disturbance that formed along a cold front. For several days, it moved southwestward, and, while located on the southwestern end of an upper-level trough {{to the north of}} Puerto Rico, deep convection throughout the system increased. The system tracked westward, and initially remained disorganized while surface pressures remained high. The system turned to a northwest drift, and began to slowly organize on August 30 while located <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> northeast of the Bahamas. A broad low-pressure area developed on August 31 though convection remained disorganized as winds of 20 to 25mph (32 to 40km/h) were reported in squalls. Conditions remained favorable for continued organization, and convection increased and persisted across the system. The system developed into Tropical Depression Five on September 1 after developing a low-level circulation while located about 140miles (225km) east of Daytona Beach, Florida.|$|E

40|$|Most {{existing}} {{economic analyses}} of optimal groundwater management use single-cell aquifer models, which assume that an aquifer responds uniformly and instantly to groundwater pumping. In this paper, we develop an economic model of groundwater management that explicitly incorporates spatial dynamic groundwater flow equations. Calibration of our model to published economic studies of specific aquifers demonstrates that existing studies generally incorrectly estimate {{the magnitude of}} the groundwater pumping externality relative to spatially explicit models. In particular, for large aquifers with surface areas of thousands of square miles, the marginal pumping externality predicted by single-cell models may be orders of magnitude less than that predicted by a spatially explicit model, even at large distances from a pumping well. Conversely, for small aquifers with areas of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> square <b>miles</b> or less, single-cell models reasonably approximate the pumping externality. Application of single-cell models to inappropriate settings may result in misleading policy implications due to understatement of the magnitude and spatial nature of the groundwater externality.

5000|$|In 1902, Lewis {{delivered}} {{an address}} on race relations to {{a gathering of}} Amherst College alumni. Lewis called race the [...] "transcendent problem" [...] facing the country, referring to the recent Spanish-American War, the disfranchisement {{of blacks in the}} South by new state constitutions, and the imposition of Jim Crow, which deprived blacks of civil rights, in his remarks: Yesterday the United States waged a war for humanity when tyranny and oppression had grown intolerable. … Only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundreds</b> of <b>miles</b> south of us are 10,000,000 people who are deprived of their rights, who are practically in a state of serfdom.

5|$|At 12:00UTC on September4, the NHC {{downgraded}} Fred to {{a tropical}} depression as its wind circulation waned; though its winds briefly picked {{back up to}} tropical storm force the next day, Fred continued as a depression with minimal convection throughout the remainder of its existence. Concurrently, a deep-altitude disturbance <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> east of Bermuda began to erode {{the southern edge of}} the high-pressure ridge that Fred had circumnavigated for most of its journey. This changed the steering pattern in the region, turning the depression abruptly to the north on September6. Over the next hours, Fred became increasingly diffuse because of its progressively worsening surroundings. It officially lost its status as a tropical cyclone at 18:00UTC, degenerating into a trough 1,210mi (1,945km) southwest of the Azores and later merging with a frontal boundary nearby.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War, new U.S. Air Force bases were {{constructed}} {{along the northern}} border of the continental U.S.; their most direct route to the Soviet Union was through the Arctic Circle. These sites were high-importance strategic bases for hosting long-range missiles and aircraft. In 1947, the New England Division of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers chose a site in northeastern Maine, within both the Limestone Township and Caswell Plantation. The remote site consisted mostly of dense forest, shallow marshes, and wild blueberry bogs, on a slight plateau over the town, which helped keep it above the fog most of the time. Only {{a small part of}} the base was suitable for farming, so there was little impact on Aroostook County's agricultural community. Additionally, Loring was not far from sources of materials for runway, taxiway, and parking apron construction. The most important benefit of the site was that it was <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> closer than any other base to potential targets in Europe.|$|E
5|$|On May24, a {{tropical}} wave emerged off the western coast of Africa. The wave entered the eastern Pacific around June6 and shower and thunderstorm activity began to increase shortly thereafter. A broad {{area of low pressure}} formed <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> south of Acapulco, Mexico two days later. Following satellite {{evidence of a}} well-defined circulation and organized convective activity, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the disturbance to {{a tropical}} depression at 1200UTC on June11. After attaining winds of 35mph (55km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1004mb (hPa; 29.65inHg), the depression began to traverse cooler waters and much more stable air. This caused all associated convection to fade away, and the depression degenerated to a non-convective remnant low at 0000UTC on June13. The remnant low continued northwest until dissipation by 0600UTC on June15.|$|E
50|$|Oceanic {{dolphins}} {{range in}} size from the 5.6 ft-long and 110 lbs kg Maui's dolphin to the 31 ft and 11 ST killer whale, the largest known dolphin. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism; the males are larger than females. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. Though not quite as flexible as seals, some dolphins can travel at 34.5 mph. Most delphinids primarily eat fish, along with a smaller number of squid and small crustaceans, but some species specialise in eating squid, or, {{in the case of the}} killer whale, also eat marine mammals and birds. All, however, are purely carnivorous. They typically have between 100 and 200 teeth, although <b>a</b> <b>few</b> species have considerably fewer. Delphinids travel in large pods, which may number a thousand individuals in some species. Each pod forages over a range of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> dozen to <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> square <b>miles.</b> Some pods have a loose social structure, with individuals frequently joining or leaving, but others seem to be more permanent, perhaps dominated by a male and a harem of females. Individuals communicate by sound, producing low-frequency whistles, and also produce high-frequency broadband clicks of 80-220 kHz, which are primarily used for echolocation. Gestation lasts from 10 to 18 months, and results in the birth of a single calf. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep warm in the cold water.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{indicator}} of speeds and distance {{as seen in}} the BSGverse is that during and after the Cylon attack Galactica and other ships are in radio communication with each other as are the various planets without signifgant delay. Adama asks if they are with voice range of Colonial One to speak with Apollo. This means they can’t be more than roughly 186,000 miles apart. Radio waves travel {{at the speed of light}} - 3 x 108 m/s. We know that Galactica is able to communicate with Apollo and Colonial One as well as Caprica and other vessels in the area. Colonial One is with <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hours of Caprica as then by necessity is Galactica. This would seem to suggest that the Galactica and Colonial One are within at least 500,000 miles of Caprica otherwise there would a signifgant time delay in communications. At 500,000 miles there would be a 3 second delay for a radio signal to reach a ship. Sense Laura Roslin appears to talk in real time to cabinet members, as does Adama to Apollo in real time, they must be relative close proximity of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> thousand <b>miles.</b> [...] If we accept this and Colonial One is 1-2 hours from Caprica as stated in pilot then it has to travel at least 500,000mph-250,000mph (804,671kph-402,336kph; 138-69 miles/sec), or 0.07419% the speed of light. However, given that Colonial ships are said to be capable of traveing at relativistic speeds, any speeds slower than 99% light are an absolute possibility. Another very real reason for traveling at significantly less than relativistic speeds are numerous. One of the most signifgant is fuel expenditure. The closer a vessel approaches light speed the greater it's mass increases as dictated by E=mc2 and thus directly related so does it's fuel expenditure. In the original 1978 series Commander Cane in [...] "Living Legend" [...] tells Adama that it will take roughly half his fuel to get the Pegasus to light speed. And second and most pratical, it would be simply insane to travel any faster than half a percent the speed of light in a star system full of asteroids, comets, junk, satellites, other ships, ETC. Objects as small as micro-meteors would be lethal at even fractions of a fraction of relativistic speeds. The time to detect and evade an object in such relative close proximity at near light speeds is literally none existent. And an FTL jump from inside a star system is just as insane for the same reasons. This is highlighted in the pilot part 1 when Colonel Tye says to Commander Adama [...] "You don't want to do this." [...] Adama replies, [...] "I know". Tye responds, [...] "Because no sane man would.", Adama replies, [...] "No choice. Colonel Tye begin preparations for a hyper-light jump." [...] Referring to Adama's decision to execute a FTL jump from inside the Helios alpha system to the Ragnar munitions anchorage orbiting the Helios Delta system. A truly last ditch effort that could very likely end in disaster.|$|R

5|$|On October4, a {{tropical}} wave exited {{the west coast}} of Africa with a large associated circulation. Unfavorable wind shear prevented any development, and the wave continued westward, entering the Caribbean Sea on October11. Two days later, the wave axis encountered a pre-existing low pressure area in the southwest Caribbean. It quickly developed a well-defined circulation, becoming {{a tropical}} depression on October14 off the east coast of Nicaragua. Due to an upper-level low in the Gulf of Mexico, the system tracked to the northwest, brushing Central America in its path. The depression developed banding features as the pressure gradually dropped, and intensified into Tropical Storm Lili at around 0600UTC on October16. During this time, the storm executed a small cyclonic loop while <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> north of the Swan Islands. By early on October17, Lili had attained hurricane status while it was turning to the north.|$|E
5|$|On September26, a {{very large}} extratropical area of low {{pressure}} developed along a quasi-stationary frontal system <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> west of the Azores. The low intensified into the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 80mph (130km/h) at 12:00UTC on September27. Over the following days, the low began to lose its frontal features and began to transition into a subtropical cyclone as it traveled in a general westward direction. By September29, the low had developed sufficient convection and was declared Subtropical Storm Laura. Upon being upgraded, cold cloud tops began to wrap around the center of Laura and consolidate near the center of circulation. The convection organized around the center quickly and a satellite pass over the storm revealed that it could be intensifying. A later satellite pass disregarded the possibility of intensification as the intensity was confirmed to be at 60mph (95km/h). The overall structure of Laura remained subtropical but there were indications that it was acquiring tropical characteristics.|$|E

Schirra noted that the sheer amount of cloud coverage, worldwide, could provide problems for future activity of this kind; however, Africa, and the south-western United States, were perfectly clear.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on September16 with copious convection. It tracked westward, developing into Tropical Depression Twelve on September21 while located <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> west of Cape Verde. Without intensifying further, the depression turned northward, due to a weakness caused by the deepening of a 200 mbar cut-off low near the Iberian Peninsula. Under {{the influence of a}} building high pressure area, the depression turned to a northwest and later westward drift. It into Tropical Storm Josephine on September24, although increased wind shear from a trough weakened the storm back to a tropical depression on September26. It remained weak for several days, gradually turning to the north due to a weak trough over the northwestern Atlantic. On October1, another high pressure area halted its northward movement, causing Josephine to turn to the east. That day, it re-intensified into a tropical storm as it began to execute a small cyclonic loop. An approaching trough caused Josephine to accelerate north-northeastward, and with favorable conditions it intensified into a hurricane on October5, after existing nearly two weeks.|$|E
5|$|The final {{tropical}} cyclone of the 2010 season developed from a tropical wave that moved off Africa on October24.

The cyclone turned northwest after formation {{while continuing to}} intensify, moving over Barbados by 09:00UTC on October30 with winds of 70mph (110km/h); as such, Tomas became the latest storm in a calendar year to strike the Windward Islands. The system reached hurricane intensity three hours later, and by 20:00UTC, attained its peak winds of 100mph (160km/h) while moving across St. Lucia. After moving into the Caribbean, {{a sharp increase in}} wind shear and dry air entrainment caused Tomas to dramatically weaken, and the storm fell to a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on November3. Fluctuating atmospheric conditions allowed Tomas to strengthen and oscillate between a tropical storm and hurricane as it curved through the Windward Passage and into the Atlantic.
