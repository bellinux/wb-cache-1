5|$|An example {{may be a}} {{local school}} system in the United States. It {{receives}} <b>a</b> <b>grant</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> its local state government to support a new special education initiative, another grant {{from the federal government}} for a school lunch program, and an annuity to award teachers working on research projects. At periodic intervals, the school system needs to generate a report to the state about the special education program, a report to a federal agency about the school lunch program, and a report to another authority about the research program. Each of these programs has its own unique reporting requirements, so the school system needs a method to separately identify the related revenues and expenditures. This is done by establishing separate funds, each with its own chart of accounts.|$|E
