Concerned by Stacey telling people her secrets, he wonders if she has ceased taking medication for her bipolar disorder.

As her reputation grew, her working and travel conditions improved. She sometimes had the use of the private railroad car of Jane Stanford, a sympathizer whose husband owned a major railroad. While lobbying and preparing for the annual suffrage conventions in Washington, she was provided with a free suite of rooms in the Riggs Hotel, whose owners supported her work.|$|E
25|$|In August 1999, Kusanagi again {{released}} a farewell appearance, the photobook Jun, and a calendar {{for the year}} 2000. Two years later, with Playboy photographer, Kim Mizuno, Kusanagi produced an 80-page, hardcover volume entitled Dangerous Curve which was released in April 2001. In her diary she expressed disappointment that she felt her career had failed. It {{could be due to}} a combination of bad business decisions, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had passed her prime so quickly. Another retirement from public life {{during the first half of}} the 2000s followed, during which time the Alice Japan, Atlas21 and MAX-A labels released several compilations of scenes from Kusanagi's previous work, as well as re-issues of the original videos.|$|E

He is mollified somewhat by the treasure he finds in the sorceresses' cottage, but his rage returns when, after returning to the People's Palace, he spots his guide. After killing the guide, he is briefly jailed but escapes, using the voice in his mind to make the D'Haran guards do his bidding, and resolves to locate Richard Rahl.|$|E

25|$|Three {{important}} aspects of Máté's life at this time were to affect her later life and work. Firstly, she discovered her aptitude for story-telling, and often used this skill at school. Secondly, Máté formed a close friendship with a beautiful Jewish girl, Maria, who, with her raven hair, white skin and red lips, became linked in Máté's vivid imagination, alternately with Snow White and the female heroines of the Bible. It was through her association with Maria, whose family disappeared in 1938, that Máté was personally confronted with Aryan racism. The families of the two girls shared a connection with the Viennese Opera. A passionate love of song and dance was to remain with Máté all her life and influence the rhythm of her poetry. The third important aspect of this time was {{the death of her}} beloved uncle, who she nursed through his last illness, doing her homework at his desk by his bedside. This event brought her to a sudden realisation of the reality of death, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> herself would die. This was later to become an aspect of her poetry.|$|E
500|$|The {{propaganda}} {{that followed}} greatly accentuated her beauty, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{was associated with}} Loyalists (although her family was primarily active in serving the Patriot cause) undermined British claims of protection for Loyalists. [...] Burgoyne's inability to punish the alleged killers also undermined British assertions {{that they were more}} civilized in their conduct of the war; the dissemination of this propaganda contributed to the success of Patriot recruiting drives in New York for several years.|$|E

However, Stroud interpreted Simone's sudden disappearance, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had left behind her wedding ring, as an indication of a desire for a divorce.

She would later align herself more publicly with the movement, sampling [...] "We should all be feminists", a speech delivered by Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie at a TEDx talk in April 2013, in her song [...] "Flawless", released later that year. In 2014 she performed live at the MTV Video Awards in front a giant backdrop reading [...] "FEMINIST." [...] She has also contributed to the Ban Bossy campaign, which uses television and social media to encourage leadership in girls. Following Beyoncé's public identification as a feminist, the sexualized nature of her performances <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> championed her marriage was questioned.|$|E
500|$|Margaret's fashion style—often {{described}} as unconventional and extravagant—and her musical endeavors, {{are the subject}} of wide media coverage in Poland. The singer has created her own original style, which has been commended by several fashion experts, praising Margaret for her distinctness and versatility. The stylist Basia Richard (who worked with Selena Gomez, Hilary Duff and Irina Shayk) is impressed by Margaret's ability to do [...] "something completely different from everyone else" [...] and has named her one of the best-dressed Polish stars. Marcin Brzeziński of Viva! magazine expressed his admiration for Margaret's approach to fashion <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has no limits, whilst Dorota Wróblewska, the Polish stylist and fashion show producer, noted that the singer is not afraid of criticism and likes to surprise with her fashion choices. Margaret has won two Polish Glamour magazine Awards for Glamour Woman of the Year and Fashion Icon.|$|E
500|$|Mandela {{was very}} {{self-conscious}} {{about being a}} man and regularly made references to manhood. He was heterosexual, and biographer Fatima Meer {{said that he was}} [...] "easily tempted" [...] by women. Another biographer, Martin Meredith, characterised him as being [...] "by nature a romantic", highlighting that he had relationships with various women. Mandela was married three times, fathered six children, and had seventeen grandchildren and at least seventeen great-grandchildren. He could be stern and demanding of his children, although he was more affectionate with his grandchildren. His first marriage was to Evelyn Ntoko Mase in October 1944; they divorced after 13 years in 1957 under the multiple strains of his adultery and constant absences, devotion to revolutionary agitation, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was a Jehovah's Witness, a religion requiring political neutrality. Mandela's second wife was the social worker Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, although they divorced in 1995. Mandela married his third wife, Graça Machel, on his 80th birthday in 1998.|$|E

500|$|According to Casting Crowns' lead vocalist Mark Hall, {{the concept}} for Come to the Well is the song [...] "The Well". Hall wrote the song {{based on the}} Biblical story of [...] "woman at the well <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was {{standing}} there talking to Jesus about water and Jesus was talking to her about water, but they weren't {{talking about the same}} water". Hall noted that, in his life, [...] "when I come to Jesus, I've already got my well figured out, I've already got what I think is going to sustain me, I just need him to sprinkle some magic Jesus dust on it and make it work. We have our wells figured and we want Jesus to fix our wells, but our wells are really holes in the ground". Hall argued that instead of using that approach, Christians should [...] "start with Jesus, then we go to the world", and said that approach is what the album is about. In writing the album, Hall worked with outside songwriters Steven Curtis Chapman, Matthew West, and Tom Douglas on several tracks; he received writing credit on eleven out of the album's twelve tracks, the exception being [...] "Face Down", which was penned by Hector Cervantes and Marc Byrd.|$|E
500|$|David's mother Gail McIntyre (Helen Worth) {{is shocked}} to learn the {{identity}} of his mystery fiancée, and disapproves of Kylie. The pair repeatedly clash in scenes that serve as comic relief. Gail dislikes Kylie because she [...] "knows her type", <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is related to Becky does not bode well. Lane said that Gail's reaction was understandable because Kylie is not the epitome of [...] "the perfect daughter-in-law." [...] She added that because Gail is so possessive of David, [...] "it doesn't {{bode well for the}} future." [...] Shepherd added that they are [...] "the match made in hell" [...] and revealed that David lets her do as she pleases because he is in love with her. He later said that David appeared obsessed and shared the similar dynamic he had with previous girlfriend Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan). He concluded: [...] "I think he's keener on her than she is on him." [...] David fools Kylie into believing he owns a salon. Lane explained [...] "Kylie sees an opportunity for a better life, but not in a money-grubbing, scheming way. She does love David, and she's not doing anything wrong." [...] Kylie sees the situation as an [...] "added bonus". After Kylie finds out the truth, the pair {{come up with a plan}} to [...] "wheedle" [...] his grandmother Audrey Roberts' (Sue Nicholls) salon off her.|$|E
500|$|George O'Malley is {{introduced}} {{as a fellow}} surgical intern to Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers); the five of them working under Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson). O'Malley and Stevens move in with Meredith, for whom he has romantic feelings but did not express them due to his fear of rejection <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{and one of the}} attendings Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) had a mutual interest in one another. On the first day of internship, O'Malley is selected by chief of cardiothoracic surgery Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington) as the first intern to perform surgery. He freezes in the operating room, and is mocked by his peers, and earns the nickname [...] "007" [...] because of almost killing a patient in such a simple operation (referring to James Bond's [...] "licence to kill"). O'Malley dates nurse Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback), breaking up with her when he contracts syphilis from her, which she in turn contracted from Karev. His friendship with Karev is further strained when the two become trapped in an elevator with a patient who begins to bleed out. Karev freezes, and O'Malley is able to save the patient single-handedly. He goes on to admit his feelings to Meredith, and the two have a one-night stand. When Meredith tells him that sleeping together was a mistake, O'Malley begins avoiding her and starts dating orthopedic surgeon Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez).|$|E

500|$|... "Keep It Together" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Mark C. Taylor, author of Nots: Religion and Postmodernism, felt that [...] "Keep It Together" [...] was a [...] "striking instance of her repeated invocation of family values". He believed that Madonna's fascination for family {{was reflected in}} the song. Carol Benz, {{one of the authors of}} The Madonna Connection, believed that the song was successful in asserting the necessity of family ties. J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of [...] described the track as [...] "an uptempo romp about the trials and tribulations, and the joys of having a family." [...] Martha Bayles, author of Hole In Our Soul, felt that [...] "Keep It Together" [...] failed to become an anthem for emotional commitment, because of the funk nature of the song. Madonna, Unauthorizeds writer Christopher Anderson proclaimed the track as a worthy number-one single, and complimented the song's theme of allegiance to one's family, despite the turmoil and dissensions that occur. Lucy O'Brien, author of Madonna: Like an Icon, described it as an [...] "upbeat meditation on sibling power" [...] and believed that the purpose behind the song was to present a homey image of brothers and sisters happy and together, and Madonna's need to restore bonds and relationships that had become fraught or distant in her life then. Hadley Freeman from The Guardian described [...] "Keep It Together" [...] as [...] "amazing, purely for being Madonna's take on Sister Sledge's 'We Are Family', a concept no one foresaw, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> later disowned various members of her family gives it, shall we say, an interesting tinge of irony." ...|$|E
500|$|Jim Sterling of The Escapist {{wrote that}} Zero's portrayal, {{especially}} her sexual empowerment <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had dominance over the male characters, was [...] "refreshing". Capsule Computers' Travis Bruno commented that Zero is [...] "largely the villain of the series", {{but that he}} {{felt the need to}} see her journey through to its end. Ron Duwell of Techno Buffalo, while commenting {{on the quality of the}} design of the characters, claimed that Zero was [...] "the best looking of the bunch with her acrobatic kicks and sword slashes being pulled off without a hitch." [...] Geoff Thew of Hardcore Gamer complimented the character, calling her actions, attitudes and language [...] "a nicely self-contained example of how [...] plays with juxtaposition." [...] Mike Splechta of GameZone agreed, stating [...] "the character designs were fantastic. I loved Zero's look in particular; her white flowy dress only serves as a contrast to her violent behavior since it gets drenched in blood the more you tear enemies apart with her weapons." [...] RPGFans Derek Heemsbergen referred to Zero as [...] "foul-mouthed butcher", although he was generally positive about her story and her interactions with Mikhail and the disciples, calling the latter [...] "strange and often hilarious". Andrew Barker, in an analysis of the game for RPGFan, referred to her as [...] "violence personified", noting how the game gradually justified her actions. She was also noted, alongside One, as being the only Intoner who had no real need for a disciple. In a final note, he said that he only felt comfortable with Zero during the game's fourth branch, where her motives were revealed. Anime News Network's Todd Ciolek described her as a conscious mockery of standard action-game protagonists, referring to her as [...] "murderous, foul-mouthed, impulsive, abusive, and all but impossible to like." ...|$|E
500|$|Lady Gaga Presents the Monster Ball Tour: At Madison Square Garden {{was filmed}} at Madison Square Garden in Gaga's {{hometown}} of New York City, the two-hour special {{was directed by}} the singer's choreographer Laurieann Gibson and produced by HBO, with the first broadcast on the channel on May 7, 2011, a day after Gaga's last date of The Monster Ball Tour. The channel had released a trailer for the special in YouTube and a poster in their website, which showed Gaga with her characteristic pyrotechnic bra emitting sparks. According to Billboard, the special was watched by 1.2million viewers. The special received critical acclaim. On review aggregate website Metacritic, the special holds a rating of 81 out of 100 based on four critic reviews, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald wrote, [...] "etween the orgy of visuals—stripper strobes, androgynous dancers and a very loose, X-rated 'Wizard of Oz' theme—we get some great song and dance numbers: 'Poker Face', 'Paparazzi' and 'Bad Romance'. These are amazing hits, club-thumping tracks that define joy and sadness for a generation of suburban teens and the urban disenfranchised." [...] However, {{he felt that the}} show's non-concert content was not genuine, and found the special to be similar to Madonna's 1991 documentary [...] The A.V. Clubs Genevieve Koski gave the special a B+ rating, claiming that Gaga [...] "proves that she is a performer" [...] and that [...] "she puts on a show", though she felt that the concert was overly emotional and artistically ambitious, and that Gaga's on-stage banter was slightly annoying. Koski also compared the special to the Madonna documentary. Linda Stassi from New York Post was also positive in her assessment of the concert special. She complimented the behind the scenes footage, the costumes and the dancing and the pyrotechnics of the show, describing it as [...] "a concert that would make Madonna’s shows look like run-of-the-mill dinner theater." [...] A review in website Idolator described Gaga as [...] "ringleader of her own circus — in complete control of her little monsters". It went on to appreciate Gaga's vocals <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did not lip-synch, as well as the hurried costume changes, while commending the [...] "raw" [...] nature of the show.|$|E
