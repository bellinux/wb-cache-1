40|$|The {{selective}} serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (FLX) {{is widely}} prescribed for depression and anxiety-related disorders. On the other hand, enhanced serotonergic transmission {{is known to}} be classically related to anxiety. In this study, the effects of acute (5. 0 mg/kg) and chronic (5. 0 mg/kg, 22 days) FLX were investigated in both food-deprived and non-deprived rats tested in the elevated plus-maze. Significant main effects of the three factors (drug, food condition and <b>administration</b> <b>regimen)</b> were observed, but no interaction between them. The administration of either acute or chronic FLX resulted in an anxiogenic effect, as detected by a significant reduction in the percentage of time spent in the open arms and in the percentage of open arm entries. Food deprivation yielded an anxiolytic-like profile, probably related to changes in locomotor activity. The <b>administration</b> <b>regimen</b> resulted in an anxiolytic profile in chronically treated rats, as would be expected after 22 days of regular handling. The anxiogenic action of acute FLX is consistent with both its neurochemical and clinical profile. The discrepancy between the anxiogenic profile of chronic FLX and its therapeutic uses is discussed in terms of possible differences between the type of anxiety that is measured in the plus-maze and the types of human anxiety that are alleviated by fluoxetine...|$|E

DESIGN [...] An open pilot study. SETTING [...] District general hospital. PATIENTS [...] 33 suitable consecutive patients presenting within six hours of the onset of symptoms who satisfied the electrocardiographic criteria for acute myocardial infarction. INTERVENTIONS [...] Two intravenous boluses of 35 mg alteplase, 30 minutes apart. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Angiographic coronary patency at 90 minutes and 24 hours. Plasma alteplase concentration-time profile and pharmacokinetic analysis. RESULTS [...] Coronary patency at 90 minutes: 26 of 30 arteries (87 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 74 - 99 %). Coronary patency at 24 hours: 24 of 29 arteries (83 %, CI 69 - 97 %). Mean (SD) plasma tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) concentration reached 4434. 8 (2117. 8) and 4233. 3 (2217. 5) ng/ml within 10 minutes of each bolus and fell to 425. 8 (288. 3) ng/ml between boluses. The estimated peak concentrations at two minutes after boluses were 12, 389 (8580) ng/ml and 10, 811 (6802) ng/ml.

40|$|Histochemical and MRI {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that MS (multiple sclerosis) patients have abnormal deposition of iron in both gray and white matter structures. Data is emerging indicating that this iron could partake in pathogenesis by various mechanisms, e. g., promoting the production of reactive oxygen species and enhancing the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Iron chelation therapy could be a viable strategy to block iron-related pathological events or it can confer cellular protection by stabilizing hypoxia inducible factor 1 α, a transcription factor that normally responds to hypoxic conditions. Iron chelation has been shown to protect against disease progression and/or limit iron accumulation in some neurological disorders or their experimental models. Data from studies that administered a chelator to animals with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model of MS, support the rationale for examining this treatment approach in MS. Preliminary clinical studies have been performed in MS patients using deferoxamine. Although some side effects were observed, the large majority of patients were able to tolerate the arduous <b>administration</b> <b>regimen,</b> i. e., 6 – 8 h of subcutaneous infusion, and all side effects resolved upon discontinuation of treatment. Importantly, these preliminary studies did not identify a disqualifying event for this experimental approach. More recently developed chelators, deferasirox and deferiprone, are more desirable for possible use in MS given their oral administration, and importantly, deferiprone can cross the blood–brain barrier. However, experiences from other conditions indicate that the potential for adverse events during chelation therapy necessitates close patient monitoring and a carefully considered <b>administration</b> <b>regimen...</b>|$|E

Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling was {{used to describe the}} pharmacokinetics and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships on urinary sodium/potassium ratio for each drug. A one-compartment model was used to describe fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone pharmacokinetics. Mean plasma half-life was 1. 40  h (95 %CI [0. 80; 2. 10]) for fludrocortisone and 2. 10  h (95 %CI [1. 78; 2. 40]) for hydrocortisone. Clearance was 40. 8  L/h (95 %CI [33. 6; 48]) for fludrocortisone and 30  L/h (95 %CI [25. 3; 34. 7]) for hydrocortisone. An indirect response model was used to describe effects on urinary sodium/potassium ratio. Fludrocortisone plasma concentrations showed a wider inter-individual dispersion than hydrocortisone plasma concentrations. Urinary sodium/potassium ratio variability was also higher with fludrocortisone as compared to hydrocortisone. The plasma concentration of drug producing 50 % of maximal inhibition of urinary sodium/potassium (IC 50) was about 200 times lower for fludrocortisone (0. 08  μg/L, 95 %CI [0. 035; 0. 125]) than for hydrocortisone (16. 7  μg/L, 95 %CI [10. 5; 22. 9]).

30|$|The use of {{corticosteroids}} as a {{means of}} diminishing the inflammatory response to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has become a standard of practice in many institutions (Jonas 2004). <b>Administration</b> <b>regimens</b> vary since clear evidence of benefit or superiority of a particular timing remains elusive. However the administration of one dose of corticosteroid in pump prime is a standard of practice at many centres and is the preferred timing described in many studies (Hauser et al. 1998). In a survey of 36 international centres 97 % of respondents used steroids in some cases and of these 83 % used a single dose (Checcia et al. 2005). Since corticosteroids require approximately 2  hours for RNA transcription, and longer for maximal effects, administration in the pump prime may be too late to reduce the inflammatory response triggered by exposure to extracorporeal circulation (Ito et al. 1992; Xu et al. 1995).|$|R

The objective {{of this study was to}} elicit patient preferences for a comprehensive profile of attributes associated with chemotherapies for breast cancer. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 121 patients with stage I-IV breast cancer who completed an internet-based conjoint survey that assessed the following attributes: ten grade III/IV toxicities, survival advantage, and <b>administration</b> <b>regimen.</b> Literature and expert input were used to identify descriptions for each attribute and respective levels (eg, different risks of toxicities).

Results: Of the twelve attributes, survival was the most important; specifically, a survival advantage of 3 months versus no survival advantage was most influential in the perceived value of chemotherapy. Among toxicities, the differences in the risks of neutropenia with hospitalization, diarrhea, nausea, and fatigue had the most impact on preferences; the risk differences of myalgia, stomatitis, and hand-foot syndrome had the least.

The efficacy of the two formulations was similar. The improved tolerability associated with prolonged-release metformin probably arises from the tablet design, which releases metformin into the upper intestine by diffusion from a dual hydrophilic polymer matrix (GelShield diffusion system). This provides slower, smoother and longer drug delivery, without an initial rapid rise in plasma metformin.

Conclusions. Primary care providers must continually reevaluate and simplify medication regimens for dependent elderly persons in the care of family members, and the family caregivers must be given adequate training and access t...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} nephro- and neurotoxicity of colistin methanesulfonate (CMS) {{was investigated}} with rats during 7 days of intravenous <b>administration</b> in <b>regimens</b> mimicking twice- and once-daily dosing of a clinically relevant dose for humans. Histological examination revealed more-severe renal lesions with the regimen corresponding to once-daily dosing, {{indicating that the}} potential for renal toxicity may be greater with extended-interval dosing.

40|$|The {{analgesic}} action of intramuscularly injected buprenorphine, methadone, flunixin meglumine and xylazine was examined in sheep, using algesimetry {{based on a}} leg withdrawal response to an electrical stimulus. No analgesic response was detected for buprenorphine, methadone or flunixin meglumine. Only the alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonist, xylazine, produced an analgesic response. The current required to elicit a response increased by 170 % (4. 5 +/- 0. 43 mA to 12. 23 +/- 1. 14 mA; mean +/- SE) after a dose of 0. 05 mg/kg xylazine; by 180 % (4. 73 +/- 0. 3 mA to 13. 28 +/- 2. 35 mA) after 0. 1 mg/kg and by 510 % (4. 52 +/- 0. 29 mA to 27. 63 +/- 3. 89 mA) after 0. 2 mg/kg. Intramuscular xylazine {{appears to be an}} effective analgesic agent for acute pain in the sheep and further investigation into ideal <b>administration</b> <b>regimens</b> and dosage may provide more detailed information on relationships between dose, analgesic and sedative effects. The findings also suggest that some common analgesic agents, and opioids in particular, may be ineffective for the management of acute pain in sheep and that any analgesic should be administered only {{on the basis of its}} proven efficacy in that species...|$|R
