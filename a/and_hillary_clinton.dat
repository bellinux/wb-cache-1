5|$|Kirchner {{did not run}} for a {{reelection in}} the 2007 presidential elections. His wife, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, ran instead.

Cristina Kirchner was elected, and Néstor Kirchner became First Gentleman. He remained highly influential during his wife's term, supervising the economy and leading the PJ. Their marriage has been {{compared with those of}} Juan and Eva Perón and Bill <b>and</b> <b>Hillary</b> <b>Clinton.</b>|$|E
5|$|McCain {{clinched}} enough delegates for {{the nomination}} and his focus shifted toward the general election, while Barack Obama <b>and</b> <b>Hillary</b> <b>Clinton</b> fought a prolonged battle for the Democratic nomination.

5|$|In 2000, he {{competed for}} the Democratic {{nomination}} for the New York State Senate 57th District against incumbent Al Coppola and Samuel A. Herbert. Coppola {{was endorsed by}} Buffalo Mayor Anthony Masiello. Brown won the September 2000 primary by a wide 18% margin. However, Coppola remained {{on the ballot in}} the general election on the Conservative Party of New York, Working Families Party and Green Party lines. The Republican Party nominee was the politically inexperienced Harrison R. Woolworth. Although Brown began the race without organized political support, he earned endorsements from many veteran non-Western New York politicians such as H. Carl McCall, Andrew Cuomo, <b>and</b> <b>Hillary</b> <b>Clinton.</b>|$|E
5|$|President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama {{attended}} 10 official inaugural balls {{during the}} evening of January 20, 2009. Barack Obama wore a new tuxedo made by Hart Schaffner Marx, a Chicago-based menswear company. He also wore a white bow tie, instead of the conventional black. Traditionalists considered this a fashion faux pas, as a white tie is conventionally only worn with a white waistcoat and tails. Michelle Obama wore a white, one-shouldered, sleeveless gown designed by 26-year-old NewYork-based designer JasonWu, breaking with the recent practice set by former first ladies Laura Bush <b>and</b> <b>Hillary</b> <b>Clinton,</b> who showcased designers from their hometowns.|$|E
5|$|The Obamas' daughters {{attended}} the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, a private school. As {{a member of}} the school's board, Michelle fought to maintain diversity in the school when other board members connected with the University of Chicago tried to reserve more slots for children of the university faculty. This resulted in a plan to expand the school. Malia and Sasha attended Sidwell Friends School in Washington, after also considering Georgetown Day School. Michelle stated in an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that they do not intend to have any more children. The Obamas have received advice from past first ladies Laura Bush, Rosalynn Carter <b>and</b> <b>Hillary</b> <b>Clinton</b> about raising children in the White House. Marian Robinson, Michelle's mother, moved into the White House to assist with child care.|$|E

5|$|She began a {{four-year}} term on 10 December 2007, facing challenges including: inflation, poor public security, international credibility, a faulty energy infrastructure, and protests from the agricultural sectors over {{an increase of}} nearly 30% on export taxes. Kirchner was the second female president of Argentina, after Isabel Martínez de Perón but, unlike Perón, {{was elected to the}} office, whereas Isabel Perón was elected Juan Perón's vice president, and automatically assumed the presidency on his death. The transition from Néstor Kirchner to Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was also the first time a democratic head of state was replaced by their spouse without the death of either. He remained highly influential during his wife's term, supervising the economy and leading the PJ. Their marriage has been compared with those of Juan and Eva Perón and Bill <b>and</b> <b>Hillary</b> <b>Clinton.</b> Media observers suspected that Mr. Kirchner stepped down as president to circumvent the term limit, swapping roles with his wife.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by David Fincher and was written by Beau Willimon, who has served as an aide to Charles Schumer, Howard Dean <b>and</b> <b>Hillary</b> <b>Clinton.</b> Independent studio Media Rights Capital purchased the rights to House of Cards, with the intent on creating a series. Netflix agreed to contribute an undisclosed fixed fee to production costs in March 2011. As he was completing his work on The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Fincher {{was introduced to the}} original miniseries by his agent and sought to develop a series with Eric Roth. House of Cards was pitched to several cable networks, including HBO, AMC and Showtime. Netflix, interested in launching their own original programming, outbid the networks, picking the series up for 26 episodes, totaling two seasons. Netflix was the only bidder that was interested in purchasing the rights without seeing a completed pilot. Thus, the show was not forced into manipulating story arcs introduced in the pilot to create artificial cliffhangers.|$|E
