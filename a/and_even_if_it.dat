5|$|Ironside {{arrived at}} British General Headquarters at 06:00am on 20 May, {{the same day}} that {{continental}} communications between France and Belgium was cut. When Ironside made his proposals known to Gort, Gort replied such an attack was impossible. Seven of his nine divisions were engaged on the Scheldt <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was possible to withdraw them, it would create a gap between the Belgians and British which the enemy could exploit and encircle the former. The BEF had been marching and fighting for nine days and was now running short of ammunition. The main effort had to be made by the French to the south.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{formulation}} of Kant's ethics is the categorical imperative, {{from which he}} derived four further formulations. Kant made a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is one we must obey {{if we want to}} satisfy our desires: 'go to the doctor' is a hypothetical imperative because we are only obliged to obey it if we want to get well. A categorical imperative binds us regardless of our desires: everyone has a duty to not lie, regardless of circumstances <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> is in our interest to do so. These imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason, rather than contingent facts about an agent. Unlike hypothetical imperatives, which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we owe duties to, we cannot opt out of the categorical imperative because we cannot opt out of being rational agents. We owe a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents; therefore, rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times.|$|E
5|$|The second {{considered}} {{application is}} animal agriculture. Cochrane argues that animals possess concrete rights {{not to be}} made to suffer or be killed while being raised for food. The book argues that factory farming inflicts suffering upon the animals used, and this suffering outweighs the cost to humans of not using the method. Killing animals for their flesh is also challenged, and objections that this infringes on human liberty, that many humans would lose their jobs and that flesh-consumption is necessary for human health are all considered and rejected. Milk and egg production may be permissible under certain circumstances, provided animals are not killed or made to suffer, and, equally, animal corpses could be used provided that the animals have died naturally. Three counter arguments are considered. First, Cochrane contends that the fact farmed animals would not exist {{were it not for the}} human desire for their flesh is irrelevant: it is not clear that creating animals is good for them, <b>and,</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> is, doing a good thing for an animal will not justify subsequently harming them, just as it would not in a human case. Second, Cochrane considers the fact that some animals are killed by nonhuman predators. He rejects Regan's claim that intervention is not required when killers are not moral agents and the consequentialist claim that interference will do more harm than good, instead suggesting that nonhuman predators need to kill to survive, but humans do not. Third, he considers the fact that animals are killed in the harvesting process. These animals, he suggests, are killed for human survival, but as fewer are killed than would be killed were humans eating meat, they do not possess a concrete right to life. Despite this, political communities must take steps to ensure that fewer animals are killed in harvest.|$|E

25|$|As {{the area}} lacked many {{industries}} at the time, supplies {{were difficult to}} acquire. This was made more difficult when the Hudson’s Bay Company’s Doctor John McLoughlin denied the shipbuilders the ability to purchase supplies from Fort Vancouver. McLoughlin refused, claiming {{that he did not}} think the boat would be seaworthy <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was able to set sail that the owners may attempt piracy with the ship. Therefore, the builders covertly procured supplies elsewhere, mainly through buying from other settlers. Additionally, the Methodist Mission’s blacksmith Josiah Lamberson Parrish would make metal spikes needed for the ship, plus Thomas J. Hubbard also made spikes for the ship.|$|E
25|$|The crater {{must have}} {{originally}} been deep, {{with a high}} mountainous rim and towering central peak. Over time the crater floor has relaxed to the spherical shape of the Tethyan surface, and the crater's rim and central peak have collapsed (similar relaxation is apparent on Jupiter's moons Callisto and Ganymede). This indicates {{that at the time}} of the Odysseus impact, Tethys must have been sufficiently warm and malleable to allow the topography to collapse; its interior may have even been liquid. If Tethys had been colder and more brittle at the time of impact, the moon might have been shattered, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> survived the impact, the topography of the crater would have retained its shape, similarly to the crater Herschel on Mimas.|$|E
25|$|The Government of India {{is aware}} of the plight of higher {{education}} sector and has been trying to bring reforms, however, 15 bills are still awaiting discussion and approval in the Parliament. One of the most talked about bill is Foreign Universities Bill, which is supposed to facilitate entry of foreign universities to establish campuses in India. The bill is still under discussion <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> gets passed, its feasibility and effectiveness is questionable as it misses the context, diversity and segment of international foreign institutions interested in India. One of the approaches to make internationalisation of Indian higher education effective is to develop a coherent and comprehensive policy which aims at infusing excellence, bringing institutional diversity and aids in capacity building.|$|E

25|$|A {{major issue}} {{at all levels}} was whether the department's written Internet policy, or Duke's {{practice}} of just collecting the overage fee, was the operating reality of the OPD workplace. If it was the former, Quon had no reasonable expectation of privacy for his pager messages. The city and department argued that Duke could not set or amend policy so {{what he said was}} irrelevant. <b>And</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was, it did not matter since the pager messages could be disclosed under the California Public Records Act. The plaintiffs argued that since Duke was the officer in charge of the contract with Arch, and the policy change that covered the pagers was never communicated in any definitive way, his assurance that he would not read Quon's messages if he reimbursed the city was all that mattered.|$|E
25|$|Following the operation, China and Russia {{criticized the}} U.S. operation. The {{destruction}} of USA-193 came {{just weeks after}} Russia had drafted a new treaty to ban space weapons which was backed by China at a UN-sponsored forum. This treaty would ban the use of weapons against satellites or other spacecraft. This prompted the Russians to accuse the United States of using the hydrazine gas as a cover-up to test an anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon. They claimed that several countries’ satellites which used toxic fuel have crashed into the Earth {{in the past but}} never warranted such “extraordinary measures”. Furthering this notion, others have speculated that the toxic gas would have likely not survived re-entry regardless, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had that the risk would be extremely small. These speculations have led many to believe that Operation Burnt Frost was in response to China’s ASAT test on 11 January, 2007 and to fear this would begin another “space race”.|$|E
25|$|The Byzantines had slowly been {{creeping}} eastward towards Armenia in {{the final}} decade of the 10th century. Emperor Basil II's numerous victories against the Arabs and internal Arab struggles helped clear a path towards the Caucasus. Constantinople's official policy was that no Christian ruler is equal to or independent of the Byzantine emperor, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was at time masked with diplomatic compromises, the empire's ultimate goal was the complete annexation of the Armenian realms. By {{the middle of the}} 10th century, the Byzantine Empire lay along the full length of the western border of Armenia. Taron was the first Armenian region annexed by the Byzantine Empire. In a certain sense, the Byzantines considered the Bagratuni princes of Taron as their vassals, for they had consistently accepted titles, such as that of strategos, and stipends from Constantinople. With the death of Ashot Bagratuni of Taron in 967 (not to be confused with Ashot III), his sons Gregory and Bagrat were not able to withstand the pressure from the empire, which annexed their principality outright and converted it to a theme.|$|E

25|$|Von Janowski {{showed up}} at the New Carlisle Hotel at 06:30 asking for a room with a bath. The son of the hotel manager, Earle Annett Jr., noticed that the {{stranger}} seemed preoccupied and quickly noticed some inconsistencies in his story. The man said he took the bus that morning before walking to the hotel, but the bus was not going through New Carlisle that day, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had, it would have dropped him off at the hotel. Annett also noticed that he spoke English with a Parisian accent, his clothing had European styling, and that he paid for his cigarettes with an obsolete Canadian dollar bill that had not been in circulation for quite some time. The stranger also had a strange smell on him; he was using Belgian matches that did not carry the Canadian government seal that was applied to matchbooks at the time. Less than three hours after his arrival and before Annett could confirm his suspicions, the stranger paid his bill and {{made his way to the}} train station where he had a coffee while waiting for the next train.|$|E
500|$|The PTC {{called on}} the United States Department of Justice and the Judiciary Committees of both houses of Congress to {{investigate}} whether MTV violated child pornography laws in casting teenaged actors in Skins, a remake of the British TV series of the same name.

Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly loved [...] "Jacksonville", believing it to be a [...] "tremendously moving, startling episode" [...] and [...] "one of [...] finest hours". AOL TV writer Jane Boursaw particularly praised the scene of Olivia trying to comfort her younger self, and then confronting Walter over it.
