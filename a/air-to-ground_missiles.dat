5|$|The Phantom {{is a large}} fighter with a {{top speed}} of over Mach2.2. It can carry more than 18,000 pounds (8,400kg) of weapons on nine {{external}} hardpoints, including air-to-air missiles, <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>missiles,</b> and various bombs. The F-4, like other interceptors of its time, was designed without an internal cannon. Later models incorporated an M61 Vulcan rotary cannon. Beginning in 1959, it set 15 world records for in-flight performance, including an absolute speed record, and an absolute altitude record.|$|E
5|$|For {{the light}} attack role, the RAH-66 {{was to be}} {{furnished}} with various armaments. It was equipped with a single 20mm three-barrel XM301 Gatling gun, which was fixed underneath the nose section. In addition, the RAH-66 was capable of internally carrying a maximum of six AGM-114 Hellfire <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>missiles</b> or up to twelve AIM-92 Stinger air-to-air missiles, which would be evenly divided between a pair of retractable weapons pylons. Beyond the internal munitions stowage, the Comanche could also carry up to four Hellfire missiles or a maximum of eight Stinger missiles externally, set upon on each of its stub wings; however, operations performing with any armaments mounted externally would unavoidably resulted in a reduction {{of the effectiveness of}} the rotorcraft's stealth technologies.|$|E
5|$|Early F-16s {{could be}} armed {{with up to}} six AIM-9 Sidewinder heat-seeking {{short-range}} air-to-air missiles (AAM) by employing rail launchers on each wingtip, as well as radar guided AIM-7 Sparrow medium-range AAMs in a weapons mix. More recent versions support the AIM-120 AMRAAM. The aircraft can carry various other AAMs, {{a wide variety of}} <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>missiles,</b> rockets or bombs; electronic countermeasures (ECM), navigation, targeting or weapons pods; and fuel tanks on 9 hardpoints – six under the wings, two on wingtips, and one under the fuselage. Two other locations under the fuselage are available for sensor or radar pods. The F-16 carries a 20 mm (0.787 in) M61A1 Vulcan cannon for close range aerial combat and strafing. The 20mm cannon is mounted inside the fuselage {{to the left of the}} cockpit.|$|E

25|$|During late 1981, it {{was soon}} clear that the modern Mirage F-1s and the Soviet MiG-25s were {{effective}} against the Iranians. The IQAF began to use their new Eastern weaponry which included Tu-22KD/KDP bombers, equipped with Kh-22M/MP <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>missiles,</b> MiG-25s equipped with Kh-23 <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>missiles</b> as well as Kh-25 and Kh-58 anti-radar missiles and also MiG-23BNs, equipped with Kh-29L/T missiles. In 1983, to satisfy the Iraqis waiting for their upgraded Exocet-capable Mirage F-1EQ5s, Super Etendards were leased to Iraq. The Iranian oil tanker fleet (see Tanker War) and gunboats suffered severe damage at {{the hand of the}} 5 Super Etendards equipped with Exocet anti-ship missiles. One of these was lost during their 20-month combat use and 4 returned to the Aeronavale in 1985.|$|E

25|$|In September 2012, ground {{tests for}} the first {{production}} Rudra were completed. It featured a turret gun, rockets, air-to-air missiles and could carry <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>missiles</b> like the anti-tank helicopter-launched Nag. HAL was awarded with a combined order of 76 Rudras for the Indian army, the primary customer, and the Indian air force. It was reported that the weapons platforms and avionics of HAL Rudra and the under-development Light Combat Helicopter would be the same.|$|E
25|$|The MC-27J is a {{development}} of the C-27J for multi-mission purposes, including command and control, communications (ISR/ISTAR), and fire support operations. In the fire support role, the MC-27J can integrate <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>missiles</b> and precision-guided munitions, {{as well as an}} optionally equipped 30mm gun can be installed and rapidly uninstalled when not required. It features systems to carry out intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance (ISTAR) missions, as well as a defensive aids suite. In July 2012, Alenia Aermacchi announced its intention to offer an upgrade program for existing C-27Js to the MC-27J configuration in the future. The MC-27J is being developed as an Alenia Aermacchi-Orbital private venture.|$|E
25|$|The Tiger ARH (Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter) is {{the version}} {{ordered by the}} Australian Army to replace its OH-58 Kiowas and UH-1 Iroquois-based 'Bushranger' gunships. The Tiger ARH is a {{modified}} and upgraded version of the Tiger HAP with upgraded MTR390 engines {{as well as a}} laser designator incorporated in the Strix sight for the firing of Hellfire II <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>missiles.</b> Instead of SNEB unguided rockets, the ARH will use 70mm (2.75in) rockets from Belgian developer, Forges de Zeebrugge (FZ). Twenty-two of the variant were ordered in December 2001. Most of the helicopters will be operated by the 1st Aviation Regiment based at Robertson Barracks in Darwin. The helicopter was shipped to Australia in part form and locally assembled at Brisbane Airport by Australia Aerospace.|$|E

500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was to be}} powered by two General Electric F412-D5F2 turbofan engines, each producing about [...] of thrust. It was designed to carry precision guided weapons internally, up to two AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missiles, two AGM-88 HARM <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>missiles</b> and a complement of air-to-ground ordnance, including unguided or precision-guided bombs, could be carried in an internal weapons bay. It has been claimed that the A-12 was {{to be capable of}} delivering nuclear weapons held in its internal weapons bay as well. [...] The A-12 was to have a weapons load of [...]|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the USAF was {{gradually}} changing the anticipated F-105 mission from nuclear interdiction to conventional bombing. The Look Alike upgrades increased the aircraft's capacity {{from four to}} 16 conventional [...] bombs on underwing and fuselage centerline hardpoints and added the equipment to launch AGM-12 Bullpup <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>missiles.</b> In June 1961, an F-105D delivered [...] of conventional bombs during a USAF test—at the time a record for a single-engine aircraft with a payload three times heavier than American four-engine heavy bombers of World War II such as the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and the Consolidated B-24 Liberator, though aerial refueling would be required for long missions. One of the F-105Ds was named Memphis Belle II after the famed World War II B-17.|$|E
500|$|The Gripen is {{compatible}} {{with a number of}} different armaments, beyond the aircraft's single 27mm Mauser BK-27 cannon (omitted on the two-seat variants), including air-to-air missiles such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder, <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>missiles</b> such as the AGM-65 Maverick, and anti-ship missiles such as the RBS-15. In 2010, the Swedish Air Force's Gripen fleet completed the MS19 upgrade process, enabling compatibility with a range of weapons, including the long-range MBDA Meteor missile, the short-range IRIS-T missile and the GBU-49 laser-guided bomb. Speaking on the Gripen's selection of armaments, Saab's campaign director for India Edvard de la Motte stated that: [...] "If you buy Gripen, select where you want your weapons from. [...] Israel, Sweden, Europe, US… South America. [...] It's up to the customer".|$|E
50|$|In June 1959, whilst {{operating}} from NAS Mayport, the squadron conducted the first operational firing of the Bullpup <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>missile</b> in the Atlantic Fleet.|$|R

50|$|The {{final version}} of the C-101, the C-101DD was {{demonstrated}} by CASA in 1985, featuring vastly improved avionics and the capability to carry the AGM-65 Maverick <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>missile,</b> but failed to attract any orders.|$|R
2500|$|Mark IV: This {{version is}} to have a French Nexter 20mm turret gun, Belgian 70mm rockets, and MBDA air-to-air and <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>missiles,</b> such as the {{anti-tank}} Helina missile. [...] All these systems have been tested individually.|$|E
2500|$|The Kh-25/Kh-25M ( [...] ; NATO:AS-10 'Karen) is {{a family}} of Soviet {{lightweight}} <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>missiles</b> with a modular range of guidance systems {{and a range of}} 10km. The anti-radar variant (Kh-25MP) is known to NATO as the AS-12 ' and has a range up to 40km. Designed by Zvezda-Strela, the Kh-25 is derived from the laser-guided version of their Kh-23 Grom (AS-7 'Kerry'). It has now been succeeded by the Kh-38 family, but the Kh-25 remains in widespread use.|$|E
2500|$|The main bays {{can also}} {{accommodate}} <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>missiles</b> {{such as the}} Kh-38M, as well as multiple [...] KAB-250 or [...] KAB-500 precision guided bombs. The aircraft {{is also expected to}} carry further developed and modified variants of Kh-35UE (AS-20 [...] "Kayak") anti-ship missile and Kh-58UShK (AS-11 [...] "Kilter") anti-radiation missile. For missions that do not require stealth, the Su-57 can carry stores on its six external hardpoints. Su-57 chief designer Alexander Davydenko has said that there is a possibility of the installation of BrahMos supersonic cruise missile on the Su-57 and its FGFA derivative; only one or two such missiles may be carried due to heavy weight of the BrahMos.|$|E
50|$|A Mk II {{version was}} planned, but was {{canceled}} {{in favor of}} the more advanced Mk III. LAMPS III added the capabilities to use anti-ship missile systems (like the AGM-119 Penguin <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>missile)</b> and night vision capability.|$|R
50|$|The Joint <b>Air-to-Ground</b> <b>Missile</b> (JAGM) is a U.S. {{military}} {{program to}} develop an air-to-surface missile to replace the current air-launched BGM-71 TOW, AGM-114 Hellfire and AGM-65 Maverick missiles. The US Army, Navy and Marine Corps plan to buy thousands of JAGMs.|$|R
50|$|CH-4 {{is capable}} of firing <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>missile</b> from {{altitude}} of 5,000 meters, therefore the aircraft can stay outside of effective range of most anti-aircraft guns. It also allow CH-4 {{to be able to}} fire from a position that provides wider viewing area.|$|R
2500|$|The {{program has}} {{expanded}} beyond a trainer concept {{to include the}} TA-50 light attack aircraft and the FA-50 light combat aircraft, similar to the multirole KF-16. [...] The TA-50 variant is a more heavily armed version of the T-50 trainer, intended for lead-in fighter training and light attack roles. It is equipped with the Elta EL/M-2032 fire control radar. The TA-50 is designed to operate as a full-fledged combat platform for precision-guided weapons, air-to-air missiles, and <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>missiles.</b> The TA-50 can mount additional utility pods for reconnaissance, targeting assistance, and electronic warfare. [...] Reconnaissance and electronic warfare variants are also being developed, designated as RA-50 and EA-50.|$|E
2500|$|French nuclear deterrence, (formerly {{known as}} [...] "Force de Frappe"), relies on {{complete}} independence. The current French nuclear force {{consists of four}} Triomphant class submarines equipped with submarine-launched ballistic missiles. In addition to the submarine fleet, {{it is estimated that}} France has about 60 ASMP medium-range <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>missiles</b> with nuclear warheads, of which around 50 are deployed by the Air Force using the Mirage 2000N long-range nuclear strike aircraft, while around 10 are deployed by the French Navy's Super Étendard Modernisé (SEM) attack aircraft, which operate from the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle. The new Rafale F3 aircraft will gradually replace all Mirage 2000N and SEM in the nuclear strike role with the improved ASMP-A missile with a nuclear warhead.|$|E
2500|$|April 8, 1970: The Israeli Air Force {{carries out}} bombing raids against targets {{identified}} as Egyptian military installations. A group of military bases about 30 {{kilometers from the}} Suez Canal is bombed. However, in what becomes known as the Bahr el-Baqar incident, Israeli F4 Phantom II fighter jets attack a single-floor school in the Egyptian town of Bahr el-Baqar, after it was mistaken for a military installation. The school is hit by five bombs and two <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>missiles,</b> killing 46 schoolchildren and injuring over 50. This incident put a definite end to the campaign, and the Israelis instead then concentrate upon Canal-side installations. The respite gives the Egyptians time to reconstruct its SAM batteries closer to the canal. [...] Soviet flown MiG fighters provide the necessary air cover. Soviet pilots also begin approaching IAF aircraft during April 1970, but Israeli pilots have orders not to engage these aircraft, and break off whenever Soviet-piloted MiGs appear.|$|E
50|$|The Joint <b>Air-to-Ground</b> <b>Missile</b> (JAGM) {{program is}} a {{follow-on}} from the unsuccessful AGM-169 Joint Common Missile program that was cancelled due to budget cuts.
