60|$|Captain MacWhirr, unprepared, took a run {{and brought}} himself {{up with a}} jerk by an <b>awning</b> <b>stanchion.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Every {{day that}} {{passed over the}} Sofala {{appeared}} to Sterne simply crammed full with proofs--with incontrovertible proofs. At night, when off duty, he would steal out of his cabin in pyjamas (for more proofs) and stand a full hour, perhaps, on his bare feet below the bridge, as absolutely motionless as the <b>awning</b> <b>stanchion</b> in its deck socket near by. On the stretches of easy navigation it is not usual for a coasting captain to remain on deck all {{the time of his}} watch. The Serang keeps it for him as a matter of custom; in open water, on a straight course, he is usually trusted to look after the ship by himself. But this old man seemed incapable of remaining quietly down below. No doubt he could not sleep. And no wonder. This was also a proof. Suddenly in the silence of the ship panting upon the still, dark sea, Sterne would hear a low voice above him exclaiming nervously-- ...|$|E
60|$|A {{little man}} with a red face framed in white {{whiskers}} waved a gold-laced cap above the rail in the waist of the yacht. Lingard raised his arm in return. Further aft, under the white awnings, he could see two men and a woman. One {{of the men and}} the lady were in blue. The other man, who seemed very tall and stood with his arm entwined round an <b>awning</b> <b>stanchion</b> above his head, was clad in white. Lingard saw them plainly. They looked at the brig through binoculars, turned their faces to one another, moved their lips, seemed surprised. A large dog put his forepaws on the rail, and, lifting up his big, black head, sent out three loud and plaintive barks, then dropped down out of sight. A sudden stir and an appearance of excitement amongst all hands on board the yacht was caused by their perceiving that the boat towing astern of the stranger was their own second gig.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Massy, {{with his}} ear {{against the door}} of Jack's cabin, listened {{critically}} to a deep stertorous breathing within. This was a dead-drunk sleep. The bout was over: tranquilized on that score, he too went in, and with slow wriggles {{got out of his}} old tweed jacket. It was a garment with many pockets, which he used to put on at odd times of the day, being subject to sudden chilly fits, and when he felt warmed he would take it off and hang it about anywhere all over the ship. It would be seen swinging on belaying-pins, thrown over the heads of winches, suspended on people's very door-handles for that matter. Was he not the owner? But his favorite place was a hook on a wooden <b>awning</b> <b>stanchion</b> on the bridge, almost against the binnacle. He had even in the early days more than one tussle on that point with Captain Whalley, who desired the bridge to be kept tidy. He had been overawed then. Of late, though, {{he had been able to}} defy his partner with impunity. Captain Whalley never seemed to notice anything now. As to the Malays, in their awe of that scowling man not one of the crew would dream of laying a hand on the thing, no matter where or what it swung from.|$|E
