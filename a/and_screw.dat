25|$|Precisely {{when the}} Chaplin Distiller was {{installed}} on Xantho {{is open to}} conjecture. It is known that from 1864 to 1870, Xantho operated out of Wick, West Sussex and was permitted to take excursions to sea. It is possible that this apparatus was installed {{during this period of}} time. It is more feasible however that this device was installed at a later date as part of the major refurbishing programme implemented by the metal merchant Robert Stewart, who, in 1871, completely and radically re-engineered the ship, replacing the original side paddlewheel steam propulsion with a new marine fire tube boiler <b>and</b> <b>screw</b> propulsion, utilising a secondhand Horizontal Trunk Engine designed by John Penn and Son.|$|E

In order to attract more business, Roach tried reducing the entry cost of purchase by offering to buy shares in the ships he sold, taking a corresponding ratio of their future earnings as part payment for their construction.

Purple drank has been considered to be a major influence in the making of and listening to chopped <b>and</b> <b>screwed</b> music due to its perceived effect of slowing the brain down, giving slow, mellow music its appeal. DJ Screw, however, repeatedly denounced the claim that one has to use purple drank to enjoy <b>screwed</b> <b>and</b> chopped music. <b>Screw,</b> a known user of purple drank, said he came up with chopped <b>and</b> <b>screwed</b> music when high on marijuana.|$|R
