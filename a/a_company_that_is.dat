25|$|Much {{contention}} {{surrounds the}} issue of fair trade products becoming a part of large companies.

The ethics of buying fair trade from <b>a</b> <b>company</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not committed to the cause are questionable; these products are only making a small dent in a big company even though these companies' products account for a significant portion of global fair trade.|$|E

500|$|PepsiCo's {{acquisition}} {{was seen}} by some analysts {{as a means for}} the company to increase its soft drinks sales. PepsiCo chairman D. Wayne Calloway denied that soft drink preference was a factor in the KFC takeover. KFC management had previously given franchisees the freedom to sell any soft drinks they wanted, but PepsiCo stated that it hoped it could convince them to stock Pepsi products. Before the takeover, only 1,000 of the 6,500 KFC outlets sold Pepsi Cola, and PepsiCo switched 1,800 company-owned stores to their own soft drinks with immediate effect. The purchase of KFC by PepsiCo led to some fast food competitors switching from Pepsi to Coca-Cola. One of the first to switch was Wendy's, whose chairman, Robert Barney, stated, [...] " [...] interests are now in conflict with Wendy's and we will not support <b>a</b> <b>company</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> trying to make our customers its customers." [...] Burger King, which had switched from Coca-Cola to PepsiCo in 1983, returned to Coca-Cola in 1990, citing the growth of the PepsiCo chains as a [...] "large factor" [...] in the switch. By 1998, the majority of KFC franchisees had agreed to stock PepsiCo soft drink products.|$|E

[...] <b>A</b> <b>company</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> required to register under the '33 act must create a registration statement, which includes a prospectus, with copious information about the security, the company, the business, including audited financial statements.

2500|$|United Kingdom {{insolvency}} law regulates {{companies in the}} United Kingdom which are unable to repay their debts. While UK bankruptcy law concerns the rules for natural persons, the term insolvency is generally used for companies formed under the Companies Act 2006. [...] "Insolvency" [...] means being unable to pay debts. Since the Cork Report of 1982, the modern policy of UK {{insolvency law}} has been to attempt to rescue <b>a</b> <b>company</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> in difficulty, to minimise losses and fairly distribute the burdens between the community, employees, creditors and other stakeholders that result from enterprise failure. If a company cannot be saved it is [...] "liquidated", so that the assets are sold off to repay creditors according to their priority. The main sources of law include the Insolvency Act 1986, the Insolvency Rules 1986, the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986, the Employment Rights Act 1996 Part XII, the Insolvency Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 and case law.
