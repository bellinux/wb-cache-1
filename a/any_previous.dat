5|$|He {{took this}} {{development}} {{to a new}} level with his 1953 orchestral work Réveil des oiseaux—its material consists almost entirely of the birdsong one might hear between midnight and noon in the Jura. From this period onwards, Messiaen incorporated birdsong into all of his compositions and composed several works for which birds provide both the title and subject matter (for example the collection of thirteen pieces for piano Catalogue d'oiseaux completed in 1958, and La fauvette des jardins of 1971). Paul Griffiths observed that Messiaen was a more conscientious ornithologist than <b>any</b> <b>previous</b> composer, and a more musical observer of birdsong than <b>any</b> <b>previous</b> ornithologist.|$|E

5|$|After {{the start}} of the civil war in 1983, a number of poets and fiction writers became active, {{focusing}} on subjects such as death, destruction, and rape. Such writings have no parallels in <b>any</b> <b>previous</b> Tamil literature.

Alston retired with more than 2,000 career wins and managed NL All-Star teams to seven victories. He was selected as Manager of the Year six times.|$|E

5|$|More recent investigations, mainly {{based on}} {{original}} medical {{reports from the}} period of the pandemic, found that the viral infection itself was not more aggressive than <b>any</b> <b>previous</b> influenza, but that the special circumstances (malnourishment, overcrowded medical camps and hospitals, poor hygiene) promoted bacterial superinfection that killed most of the victims typically after a somewhat prolonged death bed.|$|E
5|$|Several {{million years}} ago, {{a species of}} small African ape gained the ability to stand upright.

By comparison, the Great Oxygenation Event, produced by the proliferation of algae during the Siderian period, required about 300million years to culminate.|$|E
