5|$|In birds, {{the main}} arteries taking blood {{away from the}} heart {{originate}} from the right <b>aortic</b> arch (or pharyngeal arch), unlike in the mammals where the left <b>aortic</b> arch forms {{this part of the}} aorta. The postcava receives blood from the limbs via the renal portal system. Unlike in mammals, the circulating red blood cells in birds retain their nucleus.|$|E
5|$|When the {{atrioventricular}} valves (tricuspid and mitral) are open, during {{blood flow}} to the ventricles, the <b>aortic</b> and pulmonary valves are closed to prevent backflow into the ventricles. When the ventricular pressure is greater than the atrial pressure the tricuspid and mitral valves will shut. When the ventricles contract the pressure forces the <b>aortic</b> and pulmonary valves open. As the ventricles relax, the <b>aortic</b> and pulmonary valves will close in response to decreased pressure.|$|E

5|$|Gygax {{was married}} twice and had six children. In 2004, Gygax {{suffered}} two strokes, narrowly avoided a subsequent heart attack, was then diagnosed with an abdominal <b>aortic</b> aneurysm, {{and died in}} March 2008.|$|E
5|$|Pulmonary stenosis: Narrowing of the {{pulmonary}} artery as it exits the heart. Other cardiac abnormalities may be present, including <b>aortic</b> stenosis, or mitral valve prolapse.|$|E
5|$|The left {{ventricle}} is much thicker {{as compared with}} the right, due to the greater force needed to pump blood to the entire body. Like the right ventricle, the left also has trabeculae carneae, but there is no moderator band. The {{left ventricle}} pumps blood to the body through the <b>aortic</b> valve and into the aorta. Two small openings above the <b>aortic</b> valve carry blood to the heart itself, the left main coronary artery and the right coronary artery.|$|E
5|$|To {{function}} in gas exchange, lungs required a blood supply. In cartilaginous fishes and teleosts, the heart lies {{low in the}} body and pumps blood forward through the ventral aorta, which splits up in a series of paired <b>aortic</b> arches, each corresponding to a gill arch. The <b>aortic</b> arches then merge above the gills to form a dorsal aorta supplying the body with oxygenated blood. In lungfishes, bowfin and bichirs, the swim bladder is supplied with blood by paired pulmonary arteries branching off from the hindmost (6th) <b>aortic</b> arch. The same basic pattern is found in the lungfish Protopterus and in terrestrial salamanders, and was probably the pattern found in the tetrapods' immediate ancestors as well as the first tetrapods. In most other bony fishes the swim bladder is supplied with blood by the dorsal aorta.|$|E

25|$|The {{prevalence}} of <b>aortic</b> root dilatation ranges from 8.8 to 42% {{in patients with}} Turner syndrome. Even if not every <b>aortic</b> root dilatation necessarily goes on to an <b>aortic</b> dissection (circumferential or transverse tear of the intima), complications such as dissection, <b>aortic</b> rupture resulting in death may occur. The natural history of <b>aortic</b> root dilatation is still unknown, but it is linked to <b>aortic</b> dissection and rupture, which has a high mortality rate.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} the cause of <b>aortic</b> insufficiency, is often due to the <b>aortic</b> root {{dilation}} (annuloaortic ectasia), which is idiopathic in over 80% of cases, but otherwise may result from aging, syphilitic aortitis, osteogenesis imperfecta, <b>aortic</b> dissection, Behçet's disease, reactive arthritis and systemic hypertension. <b>Aortic</b> root dilation {{is the most common}} cause of <b>aortic</b> insufficiency in developed countries. Additionally, <b>aortic</b> insufficiency has been linked to the use of some medications, specifically medications containing fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine isomers and dopamine agonists. Other potential causes that affect the valve directly include Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. In acute cases of <b>aortic</b> insufficiency, the main causes are infective endocarditis, <b>aortic</b> dissection or trauma.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aortic</b> {{dissection}} {{may be a}} late sequela {{of cardiac}} surgery. About 18% of individuals who present with an acute <b>aortic</b> dissection {{have a history of}} open-heart surgery. Individuals who have undergone <b>aortic</b> valve replacement for <b>aortic</b> insufficiency are at particularly high risk because <b>aortic</b> insufficiency causes increased blood flow in the ascending aorta. This can cause dilatation and weakening of the walls of the ascending aorta.|$|E
25|$|Turner {{syndrome}} {{also increases}} the risk of <b>aortic</b> dissection, by <b>aortic</b> root dilatation.|$|E
25|$|The human {{arterial}} system originates {{from the}} <b>aortic</b> arches {{and from the}} dorsal aortae starting from week 4 of embryonic life. The first and second <b>aortic</b> arches regress and forms only the maxillary arteries and stapedial arteries respectively. The arterial system itself arises from <b>aortic</b> arches 3, 4 and 6 (<b>aortic</b> arch 5 completely regresses).|$|E
25|$|A {{bicuspid}} <b>aortic</b> valve (a type of congenital {{heart disease}} involving the <b>aortic</b> valve) is found in 7–14% of individuals who have an <b>aortic</b> dissection. These individuals are prone to dissection in the ascending aorta. The risk of dissection in individuals with bicuspid <b>aortic</b> valve is not associated with the degree of stenosis of the valve.|$|E
25|$|Multiple causes {{exist for}} AI {{in the setting}} of {{ascending}} <b>aortic</b> dissection. The dissection may dilate the annulus of the <b>aortic</b> valve, so that the leaflets of the valve cannot coapt. Another mechanism is that the dissection may extend into the <b>aortic</b> root and detach the <b>aortic</b> valve leaflets. The third mechanism is that if there was an extensive intimal tear, the intimal flap may prolapse into the LV outflow tract, causing intimal intussusception into the <b>aortic</b> valve preventing proper valve closure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aortic</b> {{dissection}} affects 1 to 2% {{of patients}} with Turner syndrome. As a result, any <b>aortic</b> root dilatation should be seriously taken into account, as {{it could become a}} fatal <b>aortic</b> dissection. Routine surveillance is highly recommended.|$|E
25|$|People with an <b>aortic</b> {{dissection}} {{often have}} a history of high blood pressure; the blood pressure is quite variable at presentation with acute <b>aortic</b> dissection, and tends to be higher in individuals with a distal dissection. In individuals with a proximal <b>aortic</b> dissection, 36% present with hypertension, while 25% present with hypotension. Proximal <b>aortic</b> dissections tend to be more associated with weakening of the vascular wall due to cystic medial degeneration. In those who present with distal <b>aortic</b> dissections, 70% present with high blood pressure, while 4% present with low blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|John Ritter, died September 11, 2003 of a misdiagnosed {{thoracic}} <b>aortic</b> dissection (<b>aortic</b> aneurysm).|$|E
25|$|In {{an acute}} dissection, {{treatment}} choice {{depends on its}} location. For Stanford type A (ascending <b>aortic)</b> dissection, surgical management is superior to medical management. For uncomplicated Stanford type B (distal <b>aortic)</b> dissections (including abdominal <b>aortic</b> dissections), medical management is preferred over surgical.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aortic</b> {{insufficiency}} (AI) {{occurs in}} half to two-thirds of ascending <b>aortic</b> dissections, and {{the murmur of}} <b>aortic</b> insufficiency is audible in about 32% of proximal dissections. The intensity (loudness) of the murmur {{is dependent on the}} blood pressure and may be inaudible in the event of hypotension.|$|E
25|$|Pericarditis is a {{frequent}} cardiac manifestation. Chronic <b>aortic</b> regurgitation due to <b>aortic</b> root disease may also be seen.|$|E
25|$|Establishing the {{incidence}} of <b>aortic</b> dissection has been difficult because many cases are only diagnosed after death (which may {{have been attributed to}} another cause), and is often initially misdiagnosed. <b>Aortic</b> dissection affects an estimated 2.0–3.5 people per every 100,000 every year. Studies from Sweden suggest that {{the incidence}} of <b>aortic</b> dissection may be rising. Men are more commonly affected than women: 65% of all people with <b>aortic</b> dissection are male. The mean age at diagnosis is 63 years. In females before the age of 40, half of all <b>aortic</b> dissections occur during pregnancy (typically in the third trimester or early postpartum period).|$|E
25|$|<b>Aortic</b> {{dissection}} {{is associated}} with hypertension (high blood pressure) and many connective tissue disorders. Vasculitis (inflammation of an artery) is rarely associated with <b>aortic</b> dissection. It can also {{be the result of}} chest trauma. About 72 to 80% of individuals who present with an <b>aortic</b> dissection have a previous history of hypertension.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aortic</b> {{insufficiency}} (AI), {{also known}} as <b>aortic</b> regurgitation (AR), is the leaking of the <b>aortic</b> valve of the heart that causes blood to flow in the reverse direction during ventricular diastole, from the aorta into the left ventricle. As a consequence, the cardiac muscle is forced to work harder than normal.|$|E
25|$|Regurgitation {{through the}} <b>aortic</b> valve, if marked, is {{sometimes}} audible to a practiced ear {{with a high}} quality, especially electronically amplified, stethoscope. Generally, {{this is a very}} rarely heard murmur, even though <b>aortic</b> valve regurgitation is not so rare. <b>Aortic</b> regurgitation, though obvious using echocardiography visualization, usually does not produce an audible murmur.|$|E
25|$|Cardiovascular malformations (typically {{bicuspid}} <b>aortic</b> valve, coarctation of the aorta, {{and some}} other left-sided cardiac malformations) and hypertension predispose to <b>aortic</b> dilatation and dissection in the general population. Indeed, these same risk factors are found in more than 90% of patients with Turner syndrome who develop <b>aortic</b> dilatation. Only {{a small number of}} patients (around 10%) have no apparent predisposing risk factors. The risk of hypertension is increased three-fold in patients with Turner syndrome. Because of its relation to <b>aortic</b> dissection, blood pressure must be regularly monitored and hypertension should be treated aggressively with an aim to keep blood pressure below 140/80 mmHg. As with the other cardiovascular malformations, complications of <b>aortic</b> dilatation is commonly associated with 45,X karyotype.|$|E
25|$|Surgery for <b>aortic</b> {{dissection}} {{was first}} introduced and developed by Michael E. DeBakey, Denton Cooley, and Oscar Creech, cardiac surgeons associated with the Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, in 1954. DeBakey developed <b>aortic</b> dissection himself at age 97 in 2005, and underwent surgery in 2006. Endovascular treatment of <b>aortic</b> dissection {{was developed in the}} 1990s.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{role that}} these risk factors {{play in the}} process leading to rupture is unclear. <b>Aortic</b> root {{dilatation}} {{is thought to be}} due to a mesenchymal defect as pathological evidence of cystic medial necrosis has been found by several studies. The association between a similar defect and <b>aortic</b> dilatation is well established in such conditions such as Marfan syndrome. Also, abnormalities in other mesenchymal tissues (bone matrix and lymphatic vessels) suggests a similar primary mesenchymal defect in patients with Turner syndrome. However, no evidence suggests that patients with Turner syndrome have a significantly higher risk of <b>aortic</b> dilatation and dissection in absence of predisposing factors. So, the risk of <b>aortic</b> dissection in Turner syndrome appears to be a consequence of structural cardiovascular malformations and hemodynamic risk factors rather than a reflection of an inherent abnormality in connective tissue. The natural history of <b>aortic</b> root dilatation is unknown, but because of its lethal potential, this <b>aortic</b> abnormality needs to be carefully followed.|$|E
25|$|Acute <b>aortic</b> {{insufficiency}} In acute AI, {{as may be}} {{seen with}} acute perforation of the <b>aortic</b> valve due to endocarditis, {{there will be a}} sudden increase in the volume of blood in the left ventricle. The ventricle is unable to deal with the sudden change in volume. The filling pressure of the left ventricle will increase. This causes pressure in the left atrium to rise, and the individual will develop pulmonary edema. Severe acute <b>aortic</b> insufficiency is considered a medical emergency. There is a high mortality rate if the individual does not undergo immediate surgery for <b>aortic</b> valve replacement.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} examination {{of an individual}} with <b>aortic</b> insufficiency involves auscultation of the heart to listen for the murmur of <b>aortic</b> insufficiency and the S3 heart sound (S3 gallop correlates with development of LV dysfunction). The murmur of chronic <b>aortic</b> insufficiency is typically described as early diastolic and decrescendo, which is best heard in the third left intercostal space and may radiate along the left sternal border.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} {{surgical}} repair of type A dissections is that ascending <b>aortic</b> dissections often involve the <b>aortic</b> valve, which, having lost its suspensory support, telescopes {{down into the}} <b>aortic</b> root, resulting in <b>aortic</b> incompetence. The valve must be resuspended {{in order to be}} reseated, as well as to repair or prevent coronary artery injury. Also, the area of dissection is removed and replaced with a Dacron graft to prevent further dissection from occurring. However, type B dissections are not improved, from a mortality point of view, by the operation, unless leaking, rupture, or compromise to other organs, e.g. kidneys, occurs.|$|E
25|$|Without treatment, {{the sleep}} {{deprivation}} {{and lack of}} oxygen caused by sleep apnea increases health risks such as cardiovascular disease, <b>aortic</b> disease (e.g. <b>aortic</b> aneurysm), high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes, clinical depression, weight gain and obesity.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of <b>aortic</b> dissections originate with an intimal tear in either the ascending aorta (65%), the <b>aortic</b> arch (10%), or just distal to the ligamentum arteriosum in the descending thoracic aorta (20%).|$|E
25|$|If {{there is}} a {{significant}} difference in the pressure from one arm to the other, that may indicate a narrowing (for example, due to <b>aortic</b> coarctation, <b>aortic</b> dissection, thrombosis or embolism) of an artery.|$|E
25|$|If {{there is}} {{increased}} stroke {{volume of the}} left ventricle due to volume overload, an ejection systolic 'flow' murmur may also be present when auscultating the same <b>aortic</b> area. Unless there is concomitant <b>aortic</b> valve stenosis, the murmur should not start with an ejection click.There may also be an Austin Flint murmur, a soft mid-diastolic rumble heard at the apical area, it appears when regurgitant jet from the severe <b>aortic</b> insufficiency renders partial closure of the anterior mitral leaflet.Peripheral physical signs of <b>aortic</b> insufficiency {{are related to the}} high pulse pressure and the rapid decrease in blood pressure during diastole due to blood returning to the heart from the aorta through the incompetent <b>aortic</b> valve, although the usefulness of some of the eponymous signs has been questioned: Phonocardiograms detect AI by having electric voltage mimic the sounds the heart makes.|$|E
25|$|Two {{studies have}} {{suggested}} <b>aortic</b> dilatation in Turner syndrome, typically involving {{the root of the}} ascending aorta and occasionally extending through the <b>aortic</b> arch to the descending aorta, or at the site of previous coarctation of the aorta repair.|$|E
