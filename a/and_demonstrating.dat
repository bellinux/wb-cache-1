5|$|In the 1940s, Gandhi pooled {{ideas with}} some Muslim leaders who sought {{religious}} harmony like him, and opposed the proposed partition of British India into India and Pakistan. For example, his close friend Badshah Khan {{suggested that they}} should work towards opening Hindu temples for Muslim prayers, and Islamic mosques for Hindu prayers, to bring the two religious groups closer. Gandhi accepted this and began having Muslim prayers read in Hindu temples to play his part, {{but was unable to}} get Hindu prayers read in mosques. The Hindu nationalist groups objected and began confronting Gandhi for this one-sided practice, by shouting <b>and</b> <b>demonstrating</b> inside the Hindu temples, {{in the last years of}} his life.|$|E
5|$|On 8 September 2011 Trafalgar Square staged International Paralympic Day, {{hosted by}} Rick Edwards, Ade Adepitan and Iwan Thomas, to {{coincide}} with a visit to London by representatives of the IPC. The event celebrated the Paralympic Games, showcasing <b>and</b> <b>demonstrating</b> the 20 sports that would feature during the Games (with some sessions also made inclusive to people with hearing disabilities). It also featured appearances by Paralympic athletes Oscar Pistorius, Ellie Simmonds and Sascha Kindred, and the unveiling of a bronze statue of Pistorius by Ben Dearnley. British Prime Minister David Cameron and London's mayor Boris Johnson also appeared. Two days later on 10 September, supermarket chain Sainsbury's and Channel 4 presented Sainsbury's Super Saturday, a family event at Clapham Common. The event featured showcases of Paralympic sports, and a concert featuring pop music acts including Nicola Roberts, Olly Murs, The Wanted, Will Young, Pixie Lott, Dappy, Sugababes, The Saturdays, Chipmunk and Taio Cruz.|$|E

5|$|Smetana's {{visit to}} Liszt at Weimar {{in the summer}} of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a {{material}} reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (RichardIII, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces <b>and</b> <b>demonstrating</b> the latest musical concepts.|$|E
5|$|Compared to neurotypical children, {{those with}} ADHD {{generally}} demonstrate greater impulsivity by being influenced by reward immediacy and quality more {{than by the}} frequency of reward and effort to obtain it. However, researchers have empirically shown that these impulsive behavior patterns can be changed through {{the implementation of a}} simple self-control training procedure in which reinforcer immediacy competes with the frequency, quantity or saliency of the reward, and the delay is gradually increased. One study demonstrated that any verbal activity while waiting for reinforcement increases delay to gratification in participants with ADHD. In another study, 3 children diagnosed with ADHD <b>and</b> <b>demonstrating</b> impulsivity were trained to prefer reward rate and saliency more than immediacy through manipulation {{of the quality of the}} reinforcers and by systematically increasing the delay with a changing-criterion design. Post-assessment of the children illustrated that self-control can transfer to untrained dimensions of reinforcement; such as an increase in quality over immediacy preference due to direct training resulting in an increase in quantity over immediacy preference.|$|E
5|$|In 1707 a deed {{was found}} among the ancient files of York County, Maine, near where Wheelwright had brought his flock to settle in Wells. The deed, dated 17 May 1629, showed Wheelwright as being one of several {{recipients}} of land from the Indian sagamores of southern New Hampshire, and a signer of the document. The deed thus implied that Wheelwright was present in New England in 1629, {{even though he was}} known to be the vicar of Bilsby in Lincolnshire at the time. While many historians declared the deed to be a forgery, Charles H. Bell, in his biography of Wheelwright in 1876, presented the case that the deed could be legitimate. It was known that as the vicar of Bilsby, Wheelwright was required to send a transcript of the parish registers to a central repository once a year, and this was done in March. However, of the several transcripts found with Wheelwright's signature attached, the one for March 1629 could not be found, leaving the door wide open to the possibility that Wheelwright had come to New England during this time frame and then returned to England. Sometime after Bell published his book on Wheelwright, the missing transcript was found, proving almost conclusively that Wheelwright had never left England during his ministry at Bilsby, <b>and</b> <b>demonstrating</b> with certainty that the deed of 1629 was a forgery. Sometime before his death, Governor Bell acknowledged the sequence of events and that the deed was an ingenious fabrication, and stated this in an undated letter to the New England Historical and Genealogical Society.|$|E

5|$|Overall, {{while the}} {{armoured}} units {{that were involved}} in operations overseas acquitted themselves well, despite significant investment {{in the development of}} tank forces, they ultimately played a limited role in the Australian war effort. Three armoured divisions capable of independent operations were formed during World War II, but none were deployed outside Australia. Many individual units later fought against the Japanese in the Pacific, although only in regimental strength. Despite initial delays in receiving adequate equipment a considerable force had subsequently been developed, although it was not until late 1942 that the first units saw action in support of the infantry in New Guinea. Yet the need to quickly deploy units following the rapid Japanese advance {{and the nature of the}} terrain in the South West Pacific Area in which the bulk of Australian forces would fight meant they were unable to be deployed as a formation. Meanwhile, as the threat of invasion passed the need for large armoured formations had lessened, and the divisions had been broken up between mid-1943 and 1944 with only one operational brigade remaining by the end of the war. However, despite using tanks that were obsolete by the standards of the war in Europe the contribution of the Australian Armoured Corps to the success of later campaigns was significant, lessening casualties among the infantry <b>and</b> <b>demonstrating</b> the role of tanks in jungle operations. The Matilda proved the most successful tank used in jungle fighting by the Australian Army, achieving immediate success following its deployment to New Guinea in 1943 due to its heavy armour, manoeuvrability in close terrain, and the effectiveness of its 2-pounder against Japanese bunkers. This was possible due to the limited number of effective antitank weapons deployed by the Japanese in the areas where the Matilda was used, while the terrain was conducive to it being operated alongside infantryâ€”in the role for which the Matilda had originally been designed.|$|E
