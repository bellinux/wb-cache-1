40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. This paper {{examines}} investors' anticipation of bidder <b>and</b> <b>target</b> merger candidacy <b>and</b> if investor anticipations about candidacy affect {{the distribution of}} value between bidder <b>and</b> <b>target</b> firm shareholders. We find that bidder firms can be predicted more accurately than target firms. To investigate how merger announcement period returns are distributed among bidder <b>and</b> <b>target</b> shareholders, we control for different degrees of predictability in bidder <b>and</b> <b>target</b> selection <b>and</b> find {{that the difference between}} bidder <b>and</b> <b>target</b> firm three-day cumulative abnormal returns around a merger announcement decreases significantly. Thus, the evidence supports the hypothesis that the asymmetry in investor anticipations about merger candidacy causes disparity in bidder <b>and</b> <b>target</b> firm announcement period abnormal returns...|$|R

5|$|All of {{the warring}} parties were {{responsible}} for widespread violations {{of the laws of}} war, as civilians were caught in the ensuing crossfire. Insurgents reportedly deployed militants and established strongholds in heavily populated neighborhoods, launched mortar rounds from residential areas, <b>and</b> <b>targeted</b> public and private individuals for assassination and violence. TFG forces alleged to have failed to efficaciously warn civilians in combat zones, impeded relief efforts, plundered property, in some instances engaged in murder and violence, and mistreated detainees during mass arrests. According to HRW, the implicated TFG forces included military, police and intelligence personnel, as well as the private guards of senior TFG officials. Victims were often unable to identify TFG personnel, and confused militiamen aligned with TFG officials with TFG police officers and other state security personnel.|$|E
5|$|During 1934 {{and early}} 1935, all feature films {{released}} in the Dutch East Indies had been produced by The Teng Chun, based on Chinese mythology or martial arts, <b>and</b> <b>targeted</b> at low-class audiences, generally ethnic Chinese. This situation {{was created by the}} Great Depression, which had led to the Dutch East Indies government collecting higher taxes, advertisers asking for more money, and cinemas selling tickets at lower prices; this ensured that there was a very low profit margin for local films. During this period cinemas in the country mainly showed Hollywood productions.|$|E
5|$|Hu {{remained}} with Union {{and directed the}} company's next production, Soeara Berbisa, with peranakan sound technician Boen Kin Nam serving as assistant director. Written by Djojopranoto, the work followed two young men who compete {{for the love of}} a woman before learning that they are long-lost brothers. Djoewita had left the company at this point, and the studio hired Raden Soekarno for the leading role of this late 1941 release. The company's final completed production, Mega Mendoeng, was directed by Boen and announced soon after shooting for Soeara Berbisa had begun. This film, a romance starring Soekarno and new find Sofiati, was released in early 1942. In producing both films, Union emphasised realism <b>and</b> <b>targeted</b> educated audiences.|$|E

40|$|The {{presentation}} of a subset of studied items as retrieval cues can have detrimental effects on recall of the remaining (target) items. In three experiments, we examined whether such part-list cuing impairment depends on the similarity between cue <b>and</b> <b>target</b> items. Item similarity was manipulated by making use of pre-experimental semantic similarities between cue <b>and</b> <b>target</b> items (Experiment 1 and 2), or was episodically induced through a similarity-encoding task, in which {{participants were asked to}} interrelate cue <b>and</b> <b>target</b> items in a meaningful way (Experiment 3). In all three experiments, reliable part-list cuing impairment arose when the similarity between cues <b>and</b> <b>targets</b> was low, but no impairment was found when the similarity between cues <b>and</b> <b>targets</b> was high. Inhibitory as well as noninhibitory explanations of the findings are discussed...|$|R
5|$|In 1997, TouchWave was {{a privately}} held, venture-backed startup company in Palo Alto, California, with future {{entrepreneur}} Oliver Muoto as its marketing director. Co-founded by CEO Bo Larsson, Jeff Snider, David F. Wittenkamp, and Jesper Stroe, TouchWave released its first product, WebSwitch, in 1997. WebSwitch, a Web-based phone switch, provided telephony over IP <b>and</b> <b>targeted</b> small to medium-sized businesses and branch networks of larger organizations. The WebSwitch {{was designed to}} deliver significantly lower costs for communications, ease of management and administration and offered services on a single IP-based network platform. The timing of TouchWave's late 1997 release of its phone switch product matched Level 3's development of its first softswitch, a method to connect calls from one phone line to another without a need to use traditional hardware.|$|E
5|$|In December 2015, it was {{announced}} that a research team from University of Sydney had found a previously unseen ensemble of buried towers built and demolished during the construction of Angkor Wat, as well as massive structure of unknown purpose on its south side and wooden fortifications. The findings also include evidence of low-density residential occupation in the region, with a road grid, ponds and mounds. These indicate that the temple precinct, bounded by moat and wall, may not have been used exclusively by the priestly elite, as was previously thought. The team used LiDAR, ground-penetrating radar <b>and</b> <b>targeted</b> excavation to map Angkor Wat.|$|E

Democrats had overwhelming super-majorities in Congress, and passage of the bill at first seemed assured. Minton's support of the bill helped him earn the position of Senate majority whip, allowing him to more effectively push for its passage.

5|$|The film reignited {{the debate}} over the nature of the Terran society in Heinlein's world, and several critics accused Verhoeven of {{creating}} a fascist universe. Others, and Verhoeven himself, have stated that the film was intended to be ironic, and to critique fascism. The film has also been described as criticizing the jingoism of U.S. foreign policy, the military industrial complex, and the society in the film, which elevates violence over sensitivity. It received several negative critical reviews, reviewers suggesting that it was unsophisticated <b>and</b> <b>targeted</b> a juvenile audience, although some scholars and critics have also supported its description as satirical. The absence of the powered armor technology drew criticism from fans. The success of the film's endeavor to critique the ideology of the novel has been disputed.|$|E
