Blundell, in Library Journal, finds Angelou's poetry {{lacking in}} {{comparison}} to her prose, and states, [...] "The reader is jarred by stilted, 'poetic' language and stilted, sing-song, school-girlish rhyme". [...] She finds the best poems in Shaker <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> structured like blues music. [...] Mary S. Cosgrove, in Horn Book Magazine, calls the poems in Shaker [...] "a lyrical outpouring of seasoned feelings from the heart and mind", and calls Angelou [...] "musical, rhythmical, and enchanting". [...] J.T. Keefe, in World Literature Today, says about Shaker": [...] "Deceptively light and graceful, Maya Angelou's poems are lyrical, emotional, melancholy". [...] Keefe compares Angelou's poems to music, especially the music of French singer Édith Piaf, and also states, [...] "These poems are full of shining hurt as, like curving scimitars, they skillfully pierce the hearts of their readers".|$|E

In {{his review of}} The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season, DVD Verdict's Mac McEntire wrote that, while he prefers [...] "down-to-Earth" [...] episodes, the more [...] "outrageous" [...] episodes like [...] "Skinner's Sense of Snow" [...] <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> [...] "standouts". He added that the episode [...] "provides a lot of solid 'cool kids versus dorky adults' comedy", and that the setpiece was {{the best part of}} the episode. Matt Haigh of Den of Geek described the episode as [...] "gold", and considers it to be one of the season's best episodes. The staff of The Journal, while reviewing The Simpsons - Christmas 2 DVD set, described the episode as [...] "memorable", and John McMurtrie of the San Francisco Chronicle cited it as [...] "great". Elizabeth Skipper, another reviewer for DVD Verdict, wrote that most episodes that center around Skinner are [...] "a sure thing", and that [...] "Skinner's Sense of Snow" [...] is no exception. Both Aaron Beierle and Jason Bailey of DVD Talk argued that [...] "Skinner's Sense of Snow" [...] is one of the best episodes of the season. On the other hand, giving the episode a mixed review, Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide described the episode as [...] "mediocre". Although he found the children's revolt against Skinner amusing, he argued that the premise was not used to its full potential. He concluded his review by calling it [...] "a fairly average program".|$|E

[...] Although the work was {{originally}} estimated to cost just over $200,000, the [...] "friend" [...] later put a lien on the house for more than $500,000 and took {{the owners of the}} house to court. Mike and the crew take the house down brick by brick and stud by stud to save the family from shoddy work done under the previous contract, then design an eco-friendly home and construct it on the site. This episode is notable for employing over 100 companies and 30 months of construction work (demolition having started sometime in Season 5, and construction during Season 6) - to date the most extensive work on the show, in terms of materials, manpower, and time.

2500|$|The California wine {{regions that}} seem to favor {{producing}} premium quality Chardonnay <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> most influenced, climatically, by coastal fogs that can slow the ripening of the grape and give it more time to develop its flavors. The regions of Alexander Valley, Los Carneros, Santa Maria Valley, Russian River Valley, {{and other parts of}} Sonoma County have shown success in producing wines that reflect more Burgundian styles. Other regions often associated with Chardonnay include Napa Valley, Monterey County, and Santa Barbara County. The California Central Valley is home to many mass-produced Chardonnay brands, as well as box and jug wine production. While the exact style of the wine varies by producer, some of the terroir characteristics associated with California Chardonnay include [...] "flinty" [...] notes with the Russian River Valley and mango and guava from Monterey. A large portion of the Californian sparkling wine industry uses Chardonnay grapes from Carneros, Alexander, and Russian River valleys, with these areas attracting the attention of Champagne producers such as Bollinger, Louis Roederer, Moët et Chandon, and the Taittinger family, which have opened up wineries in last few decades.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} {{recurring}} themes within Lynch's work, leading film critics Le Blanc and Odell {{to state that}} [...] "his films are so packed with motifs, recurrent characters, images, compositions and techniques that you could view his entire output as one large jigsaw puzzle of ideas". One of the key themes that they noted was the usage of dreams and dreamlike imagery and structure within his works, something they related to the [...] "surrealist ethos" [...] of relying [...] "on the subconscious to provide visual drive". This {{can be seen in}} John Merrick's dream of his mother in The Elephant Man, Agent Cooper's dreams of the red room in Twin Peaks and the [...] "dreamlike logic" [...] of the narrative found in Eraserhead, Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire. Discussing his attitude to dreams, Lynch has stated that [...] "Waking dreams <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> important, the ones that come when I'm quietly sitting in a chair, letting my mind wander. When you sleep, you don't control your dream. I like to dive into a dream world that I've made or discovered; a world I choose... right there is the power of cinema." [...] His films are known for their use of magic realism.|$|E

2500|$|Originally {{published}} as The Secret Ascension by Tor Books in 1987 (but subsequently reprinted with the author's preferred title), {{this work is}} an homage to writer Philip K. Dick, a pastiche of his style, and includes an alternate reality version of Dick as a character. [...] The novel {{is set in a}} world in which Richard Milrose Nixon, in his fourth term as president, holds fascistic control over America, and the science fiction works of Philip K. Dick remain unpublished, distributed underground as samizdat, while his realist fiction titles <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> celebrated as masterpieces. Author and reviewer Orson Scott Card writes that [...] "the climax is not just an inward epiphany for a character… he world changes in wonderful strange ways, and the audience can read the book passionately, with sweating fingers, eager to see what happens next, yet reluctant to leave the present moment. Imagine: A writer who is already one of the best, taking risks and finding ways to be better." [...] Card does take Bishop to task for the author's characterization of Richard Nixon, calling it a [...] "caricature" [...] and a [...] "stock character of a madman." [...] Locus reviewer Tom Whitmore calls the book [...] "a masterful pastiche" [...] and [...] "…the closest thing to a classic Dick sf novel anyone has ever done." [...] Gerald Jonas in the New York Times writes [...] "Mr. Bishop is a solid, serious writer whose reach (in his previous work) has always seemed to me to exceed his grasp. Here, he catches some of Dick's fire, especially in the early chapters… Then a lot happens very quickly (as in some of Dick's own novels), and the satire, which should hold things together, turns predictable. But…the ending (starring Philip K. Dick) approaches sublimity." [...] The novel was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1989.|$|E
