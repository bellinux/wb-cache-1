5|$|More recently, in 2002, Alfred Smyth {{has argued}} that the Life is a forgery by Byrhtferth, basing his case {{primarily}} on an analysis of Byrhtferth's and Asser's Latin vocabulary. Byrhtferth's motive, according to Smyth, is to lend Alfred's prestige to the Benedictine monastic reform movement of the late tenth century. However, the argument has not been found persuasive, and few historians harbour doubts about the <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work.|$|E

William Seabrook's The Magic Island made connections between religion and history and was considered a beautiful book by Carpentier.|$|E

5|$|The Hippocratic Oath, {{a seminal}} {{document}} on {{the ethics of}} medical practice, was attributed to Hippocrates in antiquity although new information shows {{it may have been}} written after his death. This is probably the most famous document of the Hippocratic Corpus. Recently the <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> document's author has come under scrutiny. While the Oath is rarely used in its original form today, it serves as a foundation for other, similar oaths and laws that define good medical practice and morals.

5|$|The <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> casket letters {{has been}} the source of much {{controversy}} among historians. It is impossible now to prove either way. The originals, written in French, were probably destroyed in 1584 by Mary's son. The surviving copies, in French or translated into English, do not form a complete set. There are incomplete printed transcriptions in English, Scots, French, and Latin from the 1570s. Other documents scrutinised included Bothwell's divorce from Jean Gordon. Moray had sent a messenger in September to Dunbar to get a copy of the proceedings from the town's registers.|$|E

A Buddhist pagoda was built under Chinese influence by the Pallava king and the town was frequented by Buddhist travelers. Thirumangai Azhwar, the 9th century vaishnavite saint poet, is believed to have stolen the golden Buddha statue to fund the Ranganathaswamy Temple at Srirangam; the <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theory is questionable.|$|E

5|$|The first {{attestation}} of the Latin term {{is attributed}} to a charter of Duke Trpimir from the year 852.

5|$|The {{relief is}} {{displayed}} in the British Museum in London, which has dated it between 1800 and 1750BCE. It originates from southern Mesopotamia, but the exact find-site is unknown. Apart from its distinctive iconography, the piece is noted for its high relief and relatively large size, which suggest that it {{was used as a}} cult relief, making it a very rare survival from the period. However, whether it represents Lilitu, Inanna/Ishtar, or Ereshkigal is under debate. The <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> object has been questioned from its first appearance in the 1930s, but opinion has generally moved in its favour over the subsequent decades.|$|E

It was a further departure from the religious or classical themes of earlier works because it depicted contemporary events with ordinary and unheroic figures. Both the choice of subject matter and the heightened manner in which the dramatic moment is depicted are typical of Romantic painting—strong indications {{of the extent to which}} Géricault had moved from the prevalent Neoclassical movement.|$|E

5|$|After Smith's death, Emma Smith {{quickly became}} alienated from Brigham Young {{and the church}} leadership. Young, whom Emma feared and despised, was {{suspicious}} of her desire to preserve the family's assets from inclusion {{with those of the}} church, and thought she would be even more troublesome because she openly opposed plural marriage. When most Latter Day Saints moved west, she stayed in Nauvoo, married a non-Mormon, Major Lewis C. Bidamon, and withdrew from religion until 1860, when she affiliated with the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, first headed by her son, Joseph Smith III.
