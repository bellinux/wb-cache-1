5|$|An <b>atmospheric</b> <b>probe</b> was {{released}} from the spacecraft in July 1995, entering the planet's atmosphere on December 7, 1995. After a high-g descent into the Jovian atmosphere, the probe discarded the remains of its heat shield, and it parachuted through 150km of the atmosphere, collecting data for 57.6minutes, before being crushed by the pressure and temperature to which it was subjected (about 22 times Earth normal, at a temperature of 153°C). It would have melted thereafter, and possibly vaporized. The Galileo orbiter itself experienced a more rapid version of the same fate when it was deliberately steered into the planet on September 21, 2003 at a speed of over 50km/s, in order to avoid any possibility of it crashing into and contaminating Europa.|$|E
5|$|The Galileo {{spacecraft}} was {{the first}} to have entered orbit around Jupiter, arriving in 1995 and studying the planet until 2003. During this period Galileo gathered a large amount of information about the Jovian system, making close approaches to all of the four large Galilean moons and finding evidence for thin atmospheres on three of them, as well as the possibility of liquid water beneath their surfaces. It also discovered a magnetic field around Ganymede. As it approached Jupiter, it also witnessed the impact of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9. In December 1995, it sent an <b>atmospheric</b> <b>probe</b> into the Jovian atmosphere, so far the only craft to do so.|$|E
5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to orbit Jupiter was the Galileo orbiter, which went into orbit around Jupiter on December 7, 1995. It orbited the planet for over seven years, making 35 orbits {{before it was}} destroyed during a controlled impact with Jupiter on September 21, 2003. During this period, it gathered {{a large amount of}} information about the Jovian system; the amount of information was not as great as intended because the deployment of its high-gain radio transmitting antenna failed. The major events during the eight-year study included multiple flybys of all of the Galilean moons, as well as Amalthea (the first probe to do so). It also witnessed the impact of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 as it approached Jupiter in 1994 and the sending of an <b>atmospheric</b> <b>probe</b> into the Jovian atmosphere in December 1995.|$|E

25|$|Galileo {{arrived at}} Jupiter on December 7, 1995, after a six-year journey from Earth during which it used gravity assists with Venus and Earth to boost its orbit out to Jupiter. Shortly before Galileos Jupiter Orbit Insertion maneuver, the {{spacecraft}} performed the only targeted flyby of Io of its nominal mission. High-resolution images were originally planned during the encounter, but {{problems with the}} spacecraft's tape recorder, used to save data taken during encounters for later playback to Earth, required the elimination of high-data-rate observations from the flyby schedule to ensure the safe recording of Galileo <b>atmospheric</b> <b>probe</b> data. The encounter did yield significant results from lower data rate experiments. Analysis of the Doppler shift of Galileos radio signal showed that Io is differentiated with a large iron core, similar to that found in the rocky planets of the inner Solar System. Magnetometer data from the encounter, combined {{with the discovery of}} an iron core, suggested that Io might have a magnetic field.|$|E

25|$|Planning for {{the next}} NASA mission to Jupiter began in 1977, just as the two Voyager probes were launched. Rather than {{performing}} a flyby of the Jupiter system like all the missions preceding it, the Galileo spacecraft would orbit Jupiter to perform close-up observations of the planet and its many moons, including Io, as well as deliver a Jovian <b>atmospheric</b> <b>probe.</b> Originally scheduled to be launched via the Space Shuttle in 1982, delays resulting from development issues with the shuttle and upper-stage motor pushed the launch back, and in 1986 the Challenger disaster delayed Galileo's launch even further. Finally, on October 18, 1989, Galileo began its journey aboard the shuttle Atlantis. En route to Jupiter, the high-gain antenna, folded up like an umbrella to allow the spacecraft to fit in the shuttle cargo bay, failed to open completely. For {{the rest of the}} mission, data from the spacecraft would have to be transmitted back to Earth at a much lower data rate using the low-gain antenna. Despite this setback, data compression algorithms uploaded to Galileo allowed it to complete most of its science goals at Jupiter.|$|E

The Galileo orbiter itself experienced a more rapid version of the same fate when it was deliberately steered into the planet on September 21, 2003 at a speed of over 50km/s to avoid any possibility of it crashing into and possibly contaminating Europa, a moon which has been hypothesized to have the possibility of harboring life.|$|E

In 1994, Galileo was perfectly positioned to watch the fragments of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 crash into Jupiter, whereas terrestrial telescopes had to wait to see the impact sites as they rotated into view. After releasing its <b>atmospheric</b> <b>probe</b> on July 13, 1995, the Galileo orbiter became the first man-made satellite of Jupiter at 01:16UTC on December 8, 1995, after it fired its main engine to enter a 198-day parking orbit.|$|E
