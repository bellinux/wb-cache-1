50|$|Reflexive self-structuring {{separates}} organizations {{from other}} groupings {{such as a}} crowd or mob. The self-structuring process is deliberately carried out through communication among role-holders and groups. Communication regarding self-structuring is recursive and dialogic in nature. It concerns the control, design, and documentation of an organization's relations, norms, processes, and entities. Communication of formal structure predetermines work routines rather than allowing them to emerge and controls the collaboration and membership-negotiation processes. Physical examples of <b>organizational</b> self-structuring include <b>a</b> charter, <b>organizational</b> <b>chart,</b> and policy manual.|$|R

We consider solutions for both zero-state and low-state cases, where such devices are organized in a tree structure T.

Of growing importance are a number of secondary positions, including teachers' advisory councils, curriculum coordinators, and intersublect instructional teams.

Third, the arrangement of the areas revealed a layout that closely resembled the actual layout of the cerebral cortex, namely an orderly progression from anterior to posterior. And fourth, the layout of the cortical areas in the tree conformed to principles of efficient, compact layout of components proposed by Cherniak. Since the tree was derived {{on the basis of the}} strength of neural correlations, these results document an orderly relation between functional interactions and layout, i. e. between structure and function...|$|R
