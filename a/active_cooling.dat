5|$|The F-22 was {{designed}} to be highly difficult to detect and track by radar. Measures to reduce radar cross-section include airframe shaping such as alignment of edges, fixed-geometry serpentine inlets that prevent line-of-sight of the engine faces from any exterior view, use of radar-absorbent material (RAM), and attention to detail such as hinges and pilot helmets that could provide a radar return. The F-22 was also designed to have decreased radio emissions, infrared signature and acoustic signature as well as reduced visibility to the naked eye. The aircraft's flat thrust-vectoring nozzle reduces infrared emissions to mitigate the threat of infrared homing ("heat seeking") surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles. Additional measures to reduce the infrared signature include special paint and <b>active</b> <b>cooling</b> of leading edges to manage the heat buildup from supersonic flight.|$|E

During the last decade, magnetic fields have been discovered and mapped for many types of <b>active</b> <b>cool</b> stars using spectropolarimetric data.

500|$|The show {{began with}} a gothic cathedral setting, which was {{developed}} by Tait Towers, a production management company. They used ScreenWorks 10mm video screens [...] with an integrated <b>active</b> <b>cooling</b> system designed to dissipate captured heat from LED tiles. The main screens could move up and down, thus creating a moving cathedral setting and steps. Onstage several dancers wearing buddhist and Christian monks' robes swung a giant thurible back and forth, as it burnt incense and appeared to cleanse the venue. The Kalakan Trio then appeared dressed in religious robes with huge head dresses, chanting excerpts from [...] "Lekhah Dodi", as the backdrop screens showed a huge cross with the letters MDNA. The religious chants eventually morph into chants of Madonna's name, as the two main backdrop screens split open to reveal a giant confessional, covered by a scrim at the front. Madonna was present inside kneeling down and praying, while the confessional was lowered to the stage with the song's opening monologue in the background. The singer was decked in a gold crown with a black veil, a tight black shirt with a leopard-printed bra peeking out from the top, leather arm bands and black skinny jeans and black high-heel boots. Madonna pretended to smash and break through the glass window of the confessional with a large rifle and proceeded to perform the song accompanied by a troupe of shirtless dancers wearing high heels, doing a choreography similar to the song's music video. The song was arranged to include musical elements of [...] "Material Girl" [...] (1985) and [...] "Give It 2 Me" [...] (2008). Moving blocks and contortionist dancers dressed up as gargoyles were also present in the performance. [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] ended with Madonna grabbing another rifle and pretending to shoot at the crowd, giving way to the second performance of the show, [...] "Revolver". The performance of the song at the November 19–20, 2012 shows in Miami, at the American Airlines Arena, were recorded and released in Madonna's fourth live album, MDNA World Tour.|$|E

To mitigate the heat problem, <b>active</b> <b>cooling</b> systems were installed in the 1970s, tapping the fire mains (fire suppression water systems) to use seawater circulating through water lines within the deflector panel. However, the water cooling system adds more complexity and failure points, and requires additional maintenance. The most recent method tried by the United States Navy for solving the heat problem was introduced in 2008 with USS George H.W. Bush which uses heavy-duty metal panels covered in heat-dissipating ceramic tiles similar to those used on the Space Shuttle. The tiled panels can be changed quickly and easily—the ship carries a large replacement supply. Without active water lines, the passively-tiled deflector is expected to require much less maintenance.|$|E

Also, while the Moon's surface does get very hot at lunar noon, every Apollo landing was made shortly after lunar sunrise at the landing site; the Moon's day is about 29½ Earth days long, meaning that one Moon day (dawn to dusk) lasts nearly fifteen Earth days.
