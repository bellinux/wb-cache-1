500|$|No {{lingering}} {{about was}} allowed, no gossiping {{with the other}} actors; the women’s dressing-rooms were {{on one side of}} the stage, the men's on the other, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> not actually playing we had to mount at once our respective narrow staircases– sheep rigorously separated from the goats! [...] Once, when my mother came to see me in London, expecting to find me dwelling in haunts of gilded luxury, and far down the road to perdition, I took her behind the scenes and showed her the arrangements for the actors and actresses, conventual in their austerity. ... I think there never was a theatre run on lines of such strict propriety; no breath of scandal ever touched it in all the twenty years of my experience. [...] Gilbert would suffer no loose word or gesture either behind the stage or on it, and watched over us young women like a dragon.|$|E

500|$|On May 28, 2003, {{the first}} {{performance}} of Wicked {{was held at}} the Curran Theatre in San Francisco, as the start of SHN pre-Broadway tryouts. After officially opening on June 10, 2003, it ran there for the month and finished on June 29, 2003. Audience reaction was mostly positive and although critics tended to compliment the aesthetic and spectacle of the show, they disparaged the state of its book, score, and choreography. Dennis Harvey of Variety commented positively of the [...] "sleekly directed", [...] "snazzily designed" [...] and [...] "smartly cast" [...] production yet still disapproved of its [...] "mediocre" [...] book, [...] "trite" [...] lyrics and [...] "largely generic" [...] music while Karen D'Souza of the San Jose Mercury News wrote that [...] "Style over substance is the real theme in this Emerald City." [...] Noting mixed response, the creative team started making extensive changes, tweaking it before its transfer to Broadway. Winnie Holzman stated, [...] "Stephen [...] wisely had insisted on having three months to rewrite in-between the time we closed in San Francisco <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> to go back into rehearsals in New York. That was crucial; that was the thing that made the biggest difference {{in the life of the}} show. That time is what made the show work." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since the band's early days, Dizzy Mizz Lizzy {{have been}} using the photo of a young [...] "dizzy" [...] girl as mascot, which {{has been used in}} varying ways. Christensen explains: [...] "The photo is from around 1920. It depicts the older sister of my {{grandmother}} on mother's side. She died around the age of 12–14 of tuberculosis. Her real name is Vera. There are two or three copies of the photo in my family. I have one hanging in my apartment. The same photo hung in my home, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> searching for a cover for our first release (the 1993 promo), we felt it was a great idea to use the picture of her as a sort of mascot or logo." [...] On their demo's cover, the photograph was colored with fluorescent colors. Danish designer MandOverBord subsequently used the picture for the band's eponymous debut album and singles, coloring the girl with more natural colors but also adding red laser beams coming from her eyes. The 2002 compilation album The Best of Dizzy Mizz Lizzy superimposed the mascot over the cover art from the band's second album, Rotator. During the band's 2009 reunion, the mascot was used in promotional material and on stage, and appeared in a duotone black and white portrayal {{on the front of the}} 2010 Dizzcography box set, which contained all previous albums of which the artwork (including the mascot) were completely redrawn because the original designs had not been saved. The live DVD Live in Concert 2010 features a black and white rendering of the original photo amidst text in a theater poster design. After the band reunited in 2014, the mascot was again used, this time in the form of an anaglyph 3D rendering for promotional material, on stage, and the cover art of the 2016 studio album Forward in Reverse and its singles.|$|E
