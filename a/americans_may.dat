5|$|California native Chris Carter {{was given}} the {{opportunity}} to produce new shows for the Fox network in the early 1990s. Tired of the comedies he had been working on for Walt Disney Pictures, a report that 3.7 million <b>Americans</b> <b>may</b> have been abducted by aliens, the Watergate scandal and the 1970s horror series , triggered the idea for The X-Files. He wrote the pilot episode in 1992.|$|E
5|$|SV40 {{was found}} to be present in stocks of the {{injected}} form of the polio vaccine (IPV) in use between 1955 and 1963. It is not found in the OPV form. Over 98 million Americans received one or more doses of polio vaccine between 1955 and 1963 when a proportion of vaccine was contaminated with SV40; {{it has been estimated that}} 10–30 million <b>Americans</b> <b>may</b> have received a dose of vaccine contaminated with SV40. Later analysis suggested that vaccines produced by the former Soviet bloc countries until 1980, and used in the USSR, China, Japan, and several African countries, may have been contaminated; meaning hundreds of millions more may have been exposed to SV40.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{have shown}} a true {{association}} between history of chronic kidney disease in first- or second-degree relatives, and risk of disease. In addition, African <b>Americans</b> <b>may</b> have higher serum levels of human leukocyte antigens (HLA). High HLA concentrations can contribute to increased systemic inflammation, which indirectly may lead to heightened susceptibility for developing kidney disease. Lack of nocturnal reduction in blood pressure among groups of African Americans is also offered as an explanation, which lends further credence to a genetic cause of CKD racial disparities.|$|E
25|$|The {{topic of}} who is a MacNeil can be a {{complicated}} one. By convention, anyone descended from a member of Clan MacNeil can claim membership. Because {{of the history of}} slavery in the United States and the Caribbean, however, many African <b>Americans</b> <b>may</b> bear a MacNeil surname. Because it was not uncommon for a female slave to bear her slave-master's child, several African American MacNeils may have legitimate descent from a MacNeil, however such descent can rarely be proven, and most African American MacNeils remain uninvolved with clan activities and do not claim descent from the clan. Generally speaking, Caucasians with MacNeil surnames number between 40,000 and 80,000 worldwide.|$|E

25|$|It {{may be more}} {{appropriate}} to use for e.g. folate, since approximately 90 percent of North <b>Americans</b> <b>may</b> actually suffer more or less from folate deficiency, but only the 2.5 percent that have the lowest levels will fall below the standard reference range. In this case, the actual folate ranges for optimal health are substantially higher than the standard reference ranges. Vitamin D has a similar tendency. In contrast, for e.g. uric acid, having a level not exceeding the standard reference range still does not exclude the risk of getting gout or kidney stones. Furthermore, for most toxins, the standard reference range is generally lower than the level of toxic effect.|$|E
25|$|The Settlement of the Americas coastal {{migration}} hypothesis {{suggests that}} the first North <b>Americans</b> <b>may</b> have been here as the oldest human remains known from Alaska or Canada are from On Your Knees Cave. Anthropologists have found striking parallels between the myths, rituals, and dwelling types of the Koryaks—inhabitants of the Kamchatka Peninsula—and those of the Native peoples of America's Northwest Coast. At this time the island was {{twice as large as}} today. There is strong genetic evidence for these early people having an origin there. The Koryaks were a matrilinear seafaring people hunting whales and other marine mammals. Their god was Kujkynnjaku, the Raven. Most of the Raven myths {{are similar to those of}} the Koryak.|$|E
25|$|Interracial {{marriage}} among Filipinos is common, as {{they have}} {{the largest number of}} interracial marriages among Asian immigrant groups in California, only Japanese Americans have a higher rate nationally. Compared to other Asian Americans, Filipinos Americans {{are more likely to have}} a Hispanic spouse. Statistically, Filipino American women are more likely to marry outside of their ethnicity (38.9 percent) than Filipino American men (17.6 percent); other Asian American populations have lower rates of marrying outside of their race than both Filipino American men and women. Between 2008 and 2010, 48 percent of Filipino American marriages were with non-Asians. It is also noted that 21.8 percent of Filipino Americans are multiracial, second among Asian Americans. Depending on their parentage, multiracial Filipino <b>Americans</b> <b>may</b> refer to themselves as Mestizo, Tsinoy, Blackapino, and Mexipino.|$|E

25|$|Although <b>Americans</b> <b>may</b> favor one {{immigration}} policy over another, perceptions {{of government and}} officials' ability to implement these policies is consistently negative. In November 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama announced a set of executive actions which could extend at least temporary legal status to {{nearly half of the}} illegal immigrants in the United States. The Republican majority in the new Congress as 2015 is challenging these actions. Although some Republican senators did vote for the reform bill of 2013 Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013, Obama's executive steps are not in accord with the overall stated policy position of the Republican Party. On February 16, 2015, a federal district court judge issued a temporary injunction against the Deferred Action for Parental Accountability program (one of the November 20, 2014 deferred action measures). The Justice Department has appealed the injunction.|$|E
500|$|California native Chris Carter {{was given}} the {{opportunity}} to produce new shows for the Fox network in the early 1990s. Tired of the comedies he had been working on for Walt Disney Pictures, inspired by a report that 3.7 million <b>Americans</b> <b>may</b> have been abducted by aliens, and recalling memories of Watergate and the 1970s horror series , Carter {{came up with the idea}} for The X-Files and wrote the pilot episode himself in 1992. He initially struggled over the untested concept—executives wanted a love interest for Scully—and casting. The network wanted either a more established or a [...] "taller, leggier, blonder and breastier" [...] actress for Scully than the 24-year-old Gillian Anderson, a theater veteran with minor film experience, who Carter felt was the only choice after auditions.|$|E

Overall the average American, age 25 or older, made roughly $32,000 per year, does not have a college degree, has been, is, or will be married as well as divorced at least once during his or her lifetime, lives {{in his or her own}} home in a suburban setting, and holds a white-collar office job.|$|R

5|$|In {{terms of}} social class the average <b>American</b> <b>may</b> be {{referred}} to as being either a member of the middle or working class. The discrepancy is largely the result of differing class models and definitions of what constitutes a member of the middle class. Currently the vast majority of Americans self-identify as middle class, yet some experts in the field such Michael Zweig of Stony Brook University or Dennis Gilbert of Cornell University have brought forth different theories. As most Americans are neither professionals nor managers and lack college degrees the average <b>American</b> <b>may</b> be described as being either or both, lower middle and working class.|$|R
