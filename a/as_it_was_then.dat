5|$|The restorations {{completed}} in 1971 made the structure {{wind and water}} tight, added extra windows and installed fresh glazing, but <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> abandoned again, weather elements exacerbated by vandalism led to further structural deterioration. The castle was in a ruinous condition in 2013 and unfit for habitation.|$|E

In contrast to this original Jewry, we are presented with Süss, the elegant financial adviser to the Court, the clever politician in short, the Jew in disguise.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Holmes (1890–1965) {{was born}} in England and became Regius Professor of Geology at the University of Edinburgh in 1943. His magnum opus was Principles of Physical Geology, first {{published}} in 1944, in which he proposed the idea that slow moving convection currents in the Earth's mantle created 'continental drift' <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> called. He also pioneered the discipline of geochronology. He {{lived long enough to}} see the theory of plate tectonics become widely accepted, and he is {{regarded as one of the}} most influential geologists of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|In 907 Chester was refortified {{against the}} threat from the Vikings, and shortly {{afterwards}} the minster was founded or refounded, and Werburgh's remains were transferred there from Hanbury, probably by Æthelflæd, Lady of the Mercians. The collegiate church, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>then,</b> was restored in 1057 by Leofric, Earl of Mercia and Lady Godiva. This church was razed to the ground around 1090, with the secular canons evicted, and no known trace of it remains.|$|E

5|$|The superb fairy-wren {{breeding}} male {{is used as}} {{an emblem}} by the Bird Observation & Conservation Australia. On 12 August 1999, a superb fairywren was mistakenly illustrated for an Australia Post 45c pre-stamped envelope meant to depict a splendid fairywren. Called the blue wren <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> known, it had previously featured on a 2s.5d. stamp, released in 1964, which was discontinued {{with the advent of}} decimal currency.|$|E
5|$|By 1912, the Cardiff Football Ground, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> known, had a {{new south}} stand and {{temporary}} stands on the north, east and west ends of the ground. The south stand was covered, while the north terrace was initially without a roof. The improvements were partly funded by the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU). The opening ceremony took place on 5 October 1912, with a match between Newport RFC and Cardiff RFC. The new ground was opened by Lord Ninian Crichton-Stuart. This new development increased the ground capacity to 43,000 and much improved the facilities at the ground compared to the earlier stands.|$|E

5|$|Cambridge Castle was one {{of three}} castles built across the east of England in late 1068 by William the Conqueror in the {{aftermath}} of his northern campaign to capture York. Cambridge, or Grantabridge <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> known, was on the old Roman route from London to York and was both strategically significant and at risk of rebellion. The initial building work was conducted by Picot, the high sheriff, who later founded a priory beside the castle. The castle was built in a motte and bailey design, within the existing town, and 27 houses had to be destroyed to make space for it.|$|E
5|$|Disagreement {{exists as}} to whether Attalea should be {{considered}} a single genus, or a group of related genera. In their 1996 Field Guide to the Palms of the Americas, Andrew Henderson, Gloria Galeano and Rodrigo Bernal combined all the species in the subtribe Attaleinae (<b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> defined) into a single genus, Attalea. In his 1999 Taxonomic Treatment of Palm Subtribe Attaleinae, American botanist Sidney F. Glassman divided the group into five genera—a more narrowly defined Attalea, Orbignya, Maximiliana, Scheelea and Ynesa. Rafäel Govaerts and John Dransfield recognised a single genus in their 2005 World Checklist of Palms, and Jean-Christophe Pintaud continued this usage in his 2008 review of the genus.|$|E
5|$|Flerovium is {{currently}} the heaviest element to have had its chemistry experimentally investigated, although the chemical investigations have so far not led to a conclusive result. Two experiments were performed in April–May 2007 in a joint FLNR-PSI collaboration aiming to study the chemistry of copernicium. The first experiment involved the reaction 242Pu(48Ca,3n)287Fl and the second the reaction 244Pu(48Ca,4n)288Fl: these reactions produce short-lived flerovium isotopes whose copernicium daughters would then be studied. The adsorption properties of the resultant atoms on a gold surface were {{compared with those of}} radon, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> expected that copernicium's full-shell electron configuration would lead to noble-gas like behaviour. Noble gases interact with metal surfaces very weakly, which is uncharacteristic of metals.|$|E

5|$|Gilpin Gorst {{bought the}} estate in 1815 at public auction, {{and his son}} sold it to Thomas Usborne in 1824. When London Bridge was {{replaced}} in 1826, Usborne bought pieces of the stone balustrades, which date to 1209, and erected them behind the White House around the Buffalo Lawn. The estate changed ownership more times, but these families did not maintain the property and it fell into disrepair by 1900. Reverend Cranshaw, a local resident, bought the estate in 1911 and was the last owner prior to the Boy Scout Association, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> known.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Waterfall Gully {{was first}} {{explored}} by European {{settlers in the}} early-to-mid-19th century, and quickly became a popular location for tourists and picnickers. The government chose to retain control over portions of Waterfall Gully until 1884, when they agreed to place the land {{under the auspices of}} the City of Burnside. 28 years later the government took back the management of the southern part of Waterfall Gully, designating it as South Australia's first National Pleasure Resort. Today this area remains under State Government control, and in 1972 the Waterfall Gully Reserve, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> known, became part of the larger Cleland Conservation Park.|$|E
5|$|In July 1816, Mary Shelley and Percy Bysshe Shelley {{toured the}} Alps and visited Chamouni (<b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> known), {{as well as}} the Mer de Glace and the Bossons Glacier. They jointly {{published}} their accounts and letters in a work entitled: History of a Six Weeks' Tour through a part of France, Switzerland, Germany, and Holland; with Letters Descriptive of a Sail Round the Lake of Geneva and of the Glaciers of Chamouni. The book concludes with Mont Blanc, a 144-line poem by Percy Shelley, written whilst in Chamonix and which was inspired by the river Arve, the snow-covered summits, the chaotic glaciers and the forests that he experienced during their visit.|$|E

5|$|Stone and Parker {{worked closely}} with Obsidian on the project, {{sometimes}} having two-to-three hour meetings over four consecutive days. They worked with Obsidian until {{two weeks before the}} game was shipped. Their involvement extended beyond creative input; their company initially financed the game, believing that a game based on the controversial television show would struggle to receive financial support from publishers without them placing restrictions on the content to make it more marketable. The initial funding was intended to allow Obsidian to develop enough of the game to show a more complete concept to potential publishers. In December 2011, THQ announced that they would work with Obsidian on South Park: The Game, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> known. This partnership developed into a publishing arrangement after South Park owner Viacom, having grown wary of video games, cut its funding. Obsidian was aware when it signed with THQ that the latter was experiencing financial difficulties.|$|E
5|$|This town {{fell into}} the hands of the British in 1781 after the two naval battles between British and French fleets were fought off the coast of Negapatam, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> known: the first in 1758 as part of the Seven Years' War and the second in 1782 as part of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War. The town was taken by the British from the Dutch in 1781 (who had been {{formally}} brought into the war in 1780). When the Dutch and British reached a peace agreement in 1784, Nagapattinam was formally ceded to the British. 277 villages, with Nagore as the headquarters, were handed over to the East India Company.|$|E
5|$|Alcohol has a {{long history}} of use and misuse {{throughout}} recorded history. Biblical, Egyptian and Babylonian sources record the history of abuse and dependence on alcohol. In some ancient cultures alcohol was worshiped and in others, its abuse was condemned. Excessive alcohol misuse and drunkenness were recognized as causing social problems even thousands of years ago. However, the defining of habitual drunkenness <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> known as and its adverse consequences were not well established medically until the 18th century. In 1647 a Greek monk named Agapios was the first to document that chronic alcohol misuse was associated with toxicity to the nervous system and body which resulted in a range of medical disorders such as seizures, paralysis, and internal bleeding. In 1920 the effects of alcohol abuse and chronic drunkenness led to the failed prohibition of alcohol being considered and eventually enforced briefly in America. In 2005 alcohol dependence and abuse was estimated to cost the US economy approximately 220 billion dollars per year, more than cancer and obesity.|$|E
