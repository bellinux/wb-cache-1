5|$|Black American Sign Language (BASL) or Black Sign Variation (BSV) is a dialect of American Sign Language (ASL) {{used most}} {{commonly}} by deaf African Americans in the United States.

Today, BASL is still used by signers in the South despite public schools having been legally desegregated since 1954.|$|E
