5000|$|The {{alternating}} {{magnetic flux}} {{set up by}} the growler passes through the windings of the <b>armature</b> <b>coil,</b> generating an alternating voltage in the coil. A short in the coil creates a closed circuit that will act like the secondary coil of a transformer, with the growler acting like the primary coil. This will induce an alternating current in the shorted armature that will in turn cause an alternating magnetic field to encircle the shorted <b>armature</b> <b>coil.</b> A flat, broad, flexible piece of metal containing iron is used to detect the magnetic field generated by a shorted armature. A hacksaw blade is commonly used as a feeler. The alternating magnetic field induced by a shorted armature is strong at the surface of the armature, and when the feeler is lightly touched to the iron core of an armature winding, small currents are induced in the feeler that generate a third alternating magnetic field surrounding the feeler.|$|E
50|$|By August 1955, Japan Science and Industry Co., Ltd. was {{established}} as {{a joint venture with}} a major toy manufacturer, and an automatic <b>armature</b> <b>coil</b> winding apparatus was developed, thereby expanding production capacity to 30,000 motors per day. The machines were exceptionally loud but resulted in lower prices and cheaper toys for the children of Japan. But in September 1957, American newspapers reported that lead based paints were used on some toys imported from Japan. The Japanese toy industry was hit by a sharp drop in demand. The Mabuchi brothers, however, seized on this development as an opportunity to break away from their exclusive relationship with the toy manufacturer.|$|E
5000|$|A simple DC motor has a {{stationary}} set of magnets in the stator and an armature {{with one or}} more windings of insulated wire wrapped around a soft iron core that concentrates the magnetic field. The windings usually have multiple turns around the core, and in large motors there can be several parallel current paths. The ends of the wire winding are connected to a commutator. The commutator allows each <b>armature</b> <b>coil</b> to be energized in turn and connects the rotating coils with the external power supply through brushes. (Brushless DC motors have electronics that switch the DC current to each coil on and off and have no brushes.) ...|$|E
50|$|An {{automatic}} {{voltage control}} device controls the field current to keep output voltage constant. If the output voltage from the stationary <b>armature</b> <b>coils</b> drops {{due to an}} increase in demand, more current is fed into the rotating field coils through the voltage regulator (VR).

5000|$|Practical commutators have {{at least}} three contact segments, to prevent a [...] "dead" [...] spot where two brushes {{simultaneously}} bridge only two commutator segments.

With the remaining rotor arms, a motor can produce sufficient torque to begin spinning the rotor, and a generator can provide useful power to an external circuit.|$|E
50|$|In the {{simplest}} case, the stator has four poles {{and the field}} coils and armature windings are arranged alternately around the stator between the poles. The field magnets are arranged with their poles opposing each other, i.e. one armature is between the two North poles, one between the two South. The rotor is a simple toothed disc of magnetic, but unmagnetized, iron. As it rotates between poles, it links the flux between {{a single pair of}} opposing poles. The magnetic circuit of the stator is thus a pair of triangles, each containing a field, an armature and a shared path through the rotor. Flux passes in each circuit from one field and through one armature. As the rotor turns, the other triangular path is formed, switching the flux from one pair of field and armature to the other and also reversing the direction of the flux in the <b>armature</b> <b>coil.</b> It is this reversal of flux that produces the alternating emf.|$|E

40|$|In hybrid {{excitation}} machines (HEMs), {{there are}} two main flux sources which are permanent magnet (PM) and field excitation coil (FEC). These HEMs have better features when compared with interior permanent magnet synchronous machines (IPMSM) used in conventional hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Since all flux sources including PM, FEC and armature coils are located on stator core, the rotor becomes a single piece structure similar with switch reluctance machine (SRM). The combined flux generated by PM and FEC established more excitation fluxes that are required to produce much higher torque of the motor. In addition, variable DC FEC can control the flux capabilities of the motor, thus the machine can be applied for high-speed motor drive system. In this paper, the initial design of single-phase 8 S- 4 P inner-rotor HEFSM is presented.
