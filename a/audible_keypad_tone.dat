5000|$|Incidental music {{during the}} show is {{typically}} {{a variation of the}} show's theme, which in turn was inspired by music from the film Get Shorty. There are dozens of variations of the theme played throughout, crossing all genres of music, including the <b>keypad</b> <b>tones</b> in [...] "Mission: Poachable" [...] and nearly every incidence where a countdown of ten seconds is used. New music is composed for each episode by Patrick Belden of Belden Music and Sound. Brown met Belden while working on other projects before Brown's culinary training.|$|R

40|$|VoiceXML [1], the Voice Extensible Markup Language is {{used for}} {{creating}} audio dialogs that feature synthesized speech, digitized audio, recognition of spoken and DTMF, recording spoken input, telephony and mixed interactive conversations. Its goal is to bring the advantages of web based development and content delivery to interactive voice response applications and to voice browse the web. Like HTML, VoiceXML is also a Web-based markup language for representing human-computer dialogs. But while HTML assumes a graphical web browser, VoiceXML assumes a voice browser with audio output (Computer-synthesized and/or recorded), and audio input (voice and/or <b>keypad</b> <b>tones).</b> The VoiceXML interpreter {{is an integral part}} of the voice browsers that run on specialized voice gateway nodes that are connected both to the public switched telephone networks and to the internet. Though many Vendors have developed their own VoiceXML interpreters, the lack of any good open source VoiceXML Interpreter is the motivation behind this project...|$|R
40|$|This GSM {{controlled}} electrical loads {{is designed}} using the Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) feature. The system {{is powered by}} 5 volts dc power supply. The system has three electrical loads in which any load could be up to 2. 2 KVA. The heart {{of the system is}} the DTMF chip that converts <b>keypad</b> <b>tones</b> from a phone into binary. The circuit has two electrical wires; the first is connected to the load supply while the other is connected to a mobile phone within the circuit. A resident phone from any location connects to the mobile phone in order to control the loads, using its keypads to switch on and off the loads. Relays via transistors are connected to its output terminals and they will turn on and off the electrical loads depending on the number that is pressed on the resident phone. When a digital 1 is received by the transistor, it will get saturated, short-circuit the collector and emitter thereby switching on the relay...|$|R
50|$|The Nokia 8810 weighs 118 g {{with the}} {{standard}} battery and 98 g with the lithium battery. Its dimensions are 107×46×18 mm. The phone contains a few extra features: a clock, an alarm, and the popular game Snake. The phone is able to display any of 32 different languages. Vibration is an option for alerting the user to an event, for example receiving a text or reaching the time of an alarm. The 8810 is able {{to be used with}} Carbon Copy 5.0, which is a remote access program used for controlling a computer via a dial-up modem connection. Like all Nokia phone models, the 8810 has the option to change the 'profile'. This means that the user can select the volume and melody for tones such as the message tone, the ringing <b>tone</b> and the <b>keypad</b> <b>tone,</b> to name a few. There are also security features available on the Nokia 8810, such as a PIN code request and a call barring service.|$|R
50|$|These forcing {{functions}} {{are being used}} in the service industry as well. Call centers concerned with credit card fraud and friendly fraud are using agent-assisted automation to prevent the agent from seeing or hearing the credit card information so that it cannot be stolen. The customer punches the information into their phone <b>keypad,</b> the <b>tones</b> are masked to the agent and are not visible in the customer relationship management software.|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{technology}} in telecommunication field is the technology which is need by human being; for instance, Hand phone technology (HP). Hand phone (HP) is {{one kind of}} movement telephone that uses cell technology as the communication access. As the result, someone is easily communicated with others wherever he is. The function of HP is not only used as voice communication device but also used as long distance controller device, and usually did by <b>keypad</b> <b>tones</b> sending system (DTMF tones) in doing contact and press the keypad buttons through hand phone. The purpose of making this device is that to control the tension of electricity especially dc tension in 12 levels setting {{that is going to}} be ups and downs step by step so that the societies or industries that are need long distance controller know and use the development of technology by using device that is almost have by all community. To control this device, the writer uses MCU AT 89 C 51 minimum system acts as the brain of other series inside...|$|R
50|$|Autovon was {{replaced}} {{in the early}} 1990s by the Defense Switched Network; much of its infrastructure is now dismantled. Amateur radio equipment continues to be manufactured with 16-key DTMF <b>keypads,</b> keeping extra <b>tones</b> available for on-air use to control remote apparatus such as radio repeater stations. These tone pairs (labelled A, B, C, D) are rarely used.|$|R
5000|$|The MicroTAC, {{released}} by Motorola on April 25, 1989, was the smallest and lightest phone {{available at the}} time. Upon its release, it made headlines across the world. The phone was released as the [...] "MicroTAC Pocket Cellular Telephone." [...] The first MicroTACs were known as the Motorola 9800X, {{a continuation of the}} numerical name Motorola gave their phones in the 1980s. The MicroTAC was designed to fit into a shirt pocket. These very rare phones featured a black plastic housing and a red 8-character dot-matrix LED display, which was able to show more information than the display of its predecessor, the Motorola DynaTAC 8000X. However, dot-matrix displays of the time were still quite limited by today's standards. The inside of the flip piece had the [...] "Motorola" [...] logo on a diagonal, above thin blue diagonal lines. The badge on the front flip had a raised metallic Motorola logo, and [...] "Micro T.A.C" [...] in small blue letters above the display. The [...] "micro" [...] sized phone measured as long as over 9 in long when open and weighed in 12.3 oz with the slim battery. The phone incorporated a built-in alpha-numeric phone book as one of the many standard features. A numerically organized menu allowed the user to select options for phone operations. Some of the many options included security codes, two phone number operations, a charge rate and currency calculator, secretarial memory scratchpads, hands-free operation, <b>keypad</b> <b>tones,</b> memory protection, phone number and name storage, as well as cellular system operation options.|$|R
40|$|Direction Assistance is an {{interactive}} program that provides spoken directions for automobile travel within the Boston area. The program has a telephone interface which uses touch <b>tone</b> <b>keypad</b> input and synthetic speech output. Routes are both short and easily followed. The directions {{are given in}} fluent English. The program has successfully directed newcomers through Boston. This paper tells how we built Direction Assistance, with emphasis on how the available databases are and are not useful for this application. It also talks about automatic generation of route descriptions, and compares our work to that of others. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{precursor}} for {{the modern}} home loan banking services were the distance banking services over electronic media from the early 1980s. The term 'online' became popular in the late 1980s and referred {{to the use of}} a terminal, keyboard and TV (or monitor) to access the banking system using a phone line. 'Home banking' can also refer to the use of a numeric <b>keypad</b> to send <b>tones</b> down a phone line with instructions to the bank. Online services started in New York in 1981 when four of the city's major banks (Citibank, Chase Manhattan, Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover) offered home banking services. using the videotex system. Because of the commercial failure of videotex these banking services never became popular except in France where the use of videotex (Minitel) was subsidised by the telecom provider and the UK, where the Prestel system was used.|$|R
