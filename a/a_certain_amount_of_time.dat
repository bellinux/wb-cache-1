5|$|Additional game modes are {{available}} to the player in The Age of Kings. One mode, random map, generates a map from one of several randomly chosen map generating scripts, with players starting in the Dark Age with a Town Center, three villagers (or more depending on civilization), and a scout unit. The game can be won through military conquest, by constructing a special building known as a Wonder and keeping it standing for <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> or by obtaining control of all relics on the map for a set amount of time. Deathmatch mode allows players to begin with large amounts of resources, creating a focus on military dominance, while in the regicide mode each player is given a king unit, winning by killing {{all of the other}} monarchs.|$|E
5|$|Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries {{information}} about a protein sequence to the ribosomes, the protein synthesis factories in the cell. It is coded so that every three nucleotides (a codon) corresponds to one amino acid. In eukaryotic cells, once precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) has been transcribed from DNA, it is processed to mature mRNA. This removes its introns—non-coding sections of the pre-mRNA. The mRNA is then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is bound to ribosomes and translated into its corresponding protein form {{with the help of}} tRNA. In prokaryotic cells, which do not have nucleus and cytoplasm compartments, mRNA can bind to ribosomes while it is being transcribed from DNA. After <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> the message degrades into its component nucleotides with the assistance of ribonucleases.|$|E
5|$|NHL 17 was {{released}} for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles on September 13, 2016 in North America and September 15 in Europe. Pre-orders of any {{edition of the}} game came with a special EASHL equipment bundle {{as well as a}} unique goal celebration, imitating the one from NHL '94. The Deluxe and Super Deluxe editions came with extra gold packs for the Hockey Ultimate Team mode, delivered weekly for <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> with the Super Deluxe edition offering more packs than the Deluxe. Pre-orders made through the Xbox Games Store came with a free month of EA Access. A large update for the game {{was released}} to coincide with its launch. The update brought in several new features, items and options, while also fixing certain issues and bugs.|$|E

5|$|Several {{types of}} incense clock have been found, {{the most common}} forms include the incense stick and incense seal. An incense stick clock was an incense stick with calibrations; most were elaborate, {{sometimes}} having threads, with weights attached, at even intervals. The weights would drop onto a platter or gong below, signifying that <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> had elapsed. Some incense clocks were held in elegant trays; open-bottomed trays were also used, to allow the weights to be used together with the decorative tray. Sticks of incense with different scents were also used, so that the hours were marked by a change in fragrance. The incense sticks could be straight or spiraled; the spiraled ones were longer, and were therefore intended {{for long periods of}} use, and often hung from the roofs of homes and temples.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the {{developers}} planned to only upgrade the graphics and tweak the gameplay. However, as development was {{getting closer to}} completion, Capcom started making more substantial changes in the game. For example, the inventory was expanded so that players could carry a standard item like Jill's lock picking, while defense items, which were initially {{not going to be}} separated from the main inventory, were introduced to make the game a bit easier than the original Resident Evil. The developers originally planned to make all enemies invisible but the idea was ultimately discarded because it would have made the remake very different from the original game. However, they designed the zombies so that they could come back to life <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> after they are killed. The developers also added new areas for the player to explore, changed most of the puzzle designs, and included a new control scheme called Type C where players move their characters by pressing the R button of the GameCube controller and steer them with the analog stick. Another addition is the subplot involving the character Lisa Trevor, which was cut from the original game. Instead of using adjectives to describe difficulty levels, Mikami deliberately decided to have unique questions so that the player would pick the hard one.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{heads-up display}} simulates {{the inside of}} Samus' helmet, and {{features}} a radar, map, ammunition gauge and health meter. The player can change visors to enable new abilities such as X-ray vision, collecting information on many items, creatures and enemies, and interfacing with certain mechanisms such as force fields and elevators. Corruption also includes a hint system that periodically displays on-screen instructions and navigation assistance. The game also has {{the addition of the}} Hypermode, a feature in which health is drained to give temporary invincibility and more powerful attacks. After <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> the player will enter Corrupt Hypermode, and if not stopped leads to a non-standard game over due to Samus being overtaken by Phazon. Another new feature is the Command Visor, which allows Samus to summon remotely her gunship from a suitable landing site to save the game, or travel to another destination quickly. During the progress of the game, new abilities can be obtained to allow it to perform aerial attacks against enemy targets and transport heavy objects.|$|E

The registration expired and McDonald’s discovered two fast food restaurants in South Africa were trading under the name MacDonalds. Moreover, a businessman had applied to register the McDonald’s name.|$|E
25|$|Competitive surfing is a {{comparison}} sport. Riders, competing in pairs or small groups, are allocated <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to ride waves and display their prowess and {{mastery of the}} craft. Competitors are then judged according to how competently the wave is ridden, including the level of difficulty, as well as frequency of maneuvers.

25|$|Carburizing is {{a process}} used to case-harden steel with a carbon content between 0.1 and 0.3 wt% C. In this process steel is {{introduced}} to a carbon rich environment and elevated temperatures for <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> and then quenched so that the carbon is locked in the structure; one of the simpler procedures is repeatedly to heat a part with an acetylene torch set with a fuel-rich flame and quench it in a carbon-rich fluid such as oil.|$|E

25|$|In Chinese folk {{religions}} {{as well as}} {{the aforementioned}} faiths, people often eat vegan on the 1st and 15th of the month, {{as well as the}} eve of Chinese New Year. Some nonreligious people do this as well. This is similar to the Christian practice of lent and not eating meat on Friday. The percentage of people permanently being pure vegetarian is about the same as the modern English-speaking world, but this percentage has not really changed for a very long time. Many people eat vegan for <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> in order {{to make up for the}} belief that they have sinned.|$|E
25|$|After a cloud, for instance, {{has started}} {{its way to}} {{becoming}} a lightning generator, atmospheric water vapor acts as a substance (or insulator) that decreases the ability of the cloud to discharge its electrical energy. Over <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> if the cloud continues to generate and store more static electricity, the barrier that was created by the atmospheric water vapor will ultimately break down from the stored electrical potential energy. This energy will be released to a locally, oppositely charged region in the form of lightning. The strength of each discharge {{is directly related to the}} atmospheric permittivity, capacitance, and the source's charge generating ability.|$|E
25|$|Billy's levels {{involve a}} degree of stealth. Unlike Ray, Billy can move totally silently whilst in sneak mode, and can hide in bushes and shadows. When he does so, he is hidden from enemy sight, and his {{character}} icon on the HUD is blacked out to show he cannot be seen. Often, {{even if he is}} seen, if he can hide quickly enough, he will escape permanent detection. Both Billy and Ray can also ride horses during the game, from which they can shoot, jump large distances and enter gallop mode. Gallop mode can only be maintained for <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> however, before the horse becomes tired.|$|E

25|$|The Artistic Freedom Voucher (AFV) {{introduced}} by Dean Baker {{is a way}} for consumers to support “creative and artistic work.” In this system, each consumer would have a refundable tax credit of $100 to give to any artist of creative work. To restrict fraud, the artists must register with the government. The voucher prohibits any artist that receives the benefits from copyrighting their material for a certain length of time. Consumers can obtain music for <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> easily and the consumer decides which artists receive the $100. The money can either be given to one artist or to many, the distribution is up to the consumer.|$|E
25|$|Research {{published}} in 2016 by Mathieu Ossendrijver based on tablets {{found in the}} British Museum provides evidence that the Babylonians {{even went so far}} as to have a concept of objects in an abstract mathematical space. The tablets date from between 350 and 50 B.C.E., revealing that the Babylonians understood and used geometry even earlier than previously thought. Ossendrijver showed that the Babylonians used a method for estimating the area under a curve by drawing a trapezoid underneath, a technique previously believed to have originated in 14th century Europe. This method of estimation allowed them to, for example, find the distance Jupiter had traveled in <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fractionation regimens are individualised between {{different}} radiation therapy centers and even between individual doctors. In North America, Australia, and Europe, the typical fractionation schedule for adults is 1.8 to 2Gy per day, {{five days a}} week. In some cancer types, prolongation of the fraction schedule over too long can allow for the tumor to begin repopulating, and for these tumor types, including head-and-neck and cervical squamous cell cancers, radiation treatment is preferably completed within <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> For children, a typical fraction size may be 1.5 to 1.8Gy per day, as smaller fraction sizes are associated with reduced incidence and severity of late-onset side effects in normal tissues.|$|E
