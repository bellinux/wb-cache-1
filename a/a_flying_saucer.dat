5|$|The Independent {{newspaper}} apologised on 21 August 2006, {{writing that}} on 14 June 2006, the paper had wrongly reported Mardas' involvement with Apple Electronics Ltd. They corrected the earlier piece by writing that Mardas {{had not been}} a company employee, but a director and shareholder of Apple Electronics, and was not sacked, but resigned his directorship in May 1971, while still retaining his shareholding, until giving it to Apple Corps some years later. The paper accepted that Mardas “did not claim to have invented electric paint, <b>a</b> <b>flying</b> <b>saucer</b> or a recording studio with a ‘sonic force field’ or cause his employers to waste money on such ideas. We apologise to Mr. Mardas for these errors".|$|E

25|$|The 10th-century Japanese narrative, The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, can be {{considered}} an early example of proto-science fiction.

She is later taken back to the Moon by her real extraterrestrial family. A manuscript illustration depicts a disc-shaped flying object similar to <b>a</b> <b>flying</b> <b>saucer.</b>|$|E

When later interviewed by James McDonald, the photographers and another witness confirmed the story. Cooper said military authorities then picked up the film and neither he nor the photographers ever heard what happened to it. The incident was also reported in a few newspapers, such as the Los Angeles Times. The official explanation was that the photographers had filmed a weather balloon distorted by hot desert air.|$|E

25|$|After the event, Mr. William and Donna Smith, {{investigators}} {{associated with}} Civilian Saucer Investigation, LA, obtained {{a number of}} accounts from witnesses {{who claimed to have}} experienced a similar or related phenomena.

The encounter reportedly affected the daughter so badly that she was confined to Clarksburg Hospital for three weeks. They also gathered a statement from the mother of Eugene Lemon, in which she said that, at the approximate time of the crash, her house had been violently shaken and her radio had cut out for 45 minutes, and a report from the director of the local Board of Education in which he claimed to have seen <b>a</b> <b>flying</b> <b>saucer</b> taking off at 6:30a.m. on September13 (the morning after the creature was sighted).|$|E
25|$|Britain's {{most famous}} spy, James Bond, {{generally}} spends {{little time in}} London, other than to receive his orders from his boss 'M'. However, some of the films do feature locations in the city. These include On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) (#1 in U.S.) in which George Lazenby as Bond visits the College of Arms and For Your Eyes Only (1981) (#1 in U.S.), in which Roger Moore experiences a hair-raising helicopter flight over the Docklands area. In the more recent Pierce Brosnan films, the Secret Service's headquarters are identified as being the new MI6 building on the River Thames at Vauxhall. The 1999 film The World Is Not Enough (#1 in U.S.) opens with an extended boat chase from the MI6 building down the river to the Millennium Dome, while in Die Another Day (2002) (#1 in U.S.) Bond visits a secret base in a disused Underground station, and makes a rare trip to his club Blades. Also in the 2012 Bond movie Skyfall (#1 in U.S.), Bond spends more time in London. First while he visits M's house {{to get back to}} service. Then to new underground office of MI6, then to the Art Gallery to meet the new Quartermaster. After returning from Shanghai also, Bond spends time in London before going to Scotland. He chases Silva in London Tube and other areas in London. Also at the end of Movie, Bond sees London from his office terrace. The 1967 version of Casino Royale makes extensive use of London locations, including 10 Downing Street, Whitehall, Trafalgar Square (with Nelson's Column replaced by <b>a</b> <b>flying</b> <b>saucer)</b> as well as the Changing of the Guard outside Buckingham Palace.|$|E

In his lyrics CCR frontman John Fogerty lyrics imagine how different sectors of society would respond, with Hollywood turning the event into an epic film, The Vatican declaring it as Christ's return, then-vice president Spiro Agnew proposing a tariff on all things Martian, and Governor Reagan suspecting a communist conspiracy. Singer John Fogerty wrote about his inspiration for the song's spectacle and its Reagan reference in his 2015 memoir, saying, [...] "Walter Cronkite and Eric Sevareid are in there, big newscasters at the time.
