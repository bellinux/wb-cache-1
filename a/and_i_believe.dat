5|$|I {{spend my}} time out in the open, on the shingle beach {{when the weather is}} bad or the fishing boats go out, or I go into the {{countryside}} which is very beautiful here, that I find perhaps still more charming in winter than in summer and, naturally I work all the time, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that this year I am going to do some serious things.|$|E
25|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> in {{the communion}} of Saints.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes--I did; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> Chad too. It {{would have}} been odious and unmannerly--as well as quite perverse--if I hadn't. What {{interest}} have you in deceiving me?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{told him}} that Jerry <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had not been {{interfered}} with on the streets, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> he could go where he pleased, provided it was not too near the encampments.|$|R
6000|$|... "But all my life. Mother said to me: 'There is {{one thing}} in {{marriage}} that is always dreadful, {{but you have to}} bear it.' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> it." ...|$|R
25|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> in one Gnostic and Catholic Church of Light, Life, Love and Liberty, the Word {{of whose}} Law is THELEMA.|$|E
25|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> in one Earth, the Mother of us all, {{and in one}} Womb wherein all men are begotten, and wherein {{they shall}} rest, Mystery of Mystery, in Her name BABALON.|$|E
25|$|I {{was born}} Jewish and so I remain, {{even if that}} is {{unacceptable}} for many. For me, the vocation of Israel is bringing light to the goyim. That is my hope <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that Christianity is the means for achieving it.|$|E
60|$|MRS. H. Yes! I {{was only}} joking. And you swore that, {{as long as}} there was breath in your body, it should never come. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> you.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>believed</b> {{nothing of}} that part; but <b>I</b> <b>believed,</b> as it was, that {{whatever}} was done, Amy had done it; and that, in short, Amy {{had made her}} away; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> it the more, because Amy came no more near me, but confirmed her guilt by her absence.|$|R
6000|$|Partner was honest. [...] "Yes, once. He was old <b>and</b> sick <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> {{it better}} to put {{him out of his}} {{suffering}} than to let him drag on." ...|$|R
25|$|To put {{artifacts}} {{in their proper}} context I consider it most important {{to pay attention to}} the chronological sequence, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that the old idea of first stone, then copper, and finally iron, appears to be ever more firmly established as far as Scandinavia is concerned.|$|E
25|$|Researcher and {{composer}} Miguel Angel Martin {{writes in his}} book Del Folclor llanero (Folklore from the eastern plains) from 1978:"I believe the tiple was brought {{to us from the}} Canary Islands <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> the first tiples were made at the settlements of Tamara, Morcote, Pauto and Tame in the Casanare".|$|E
25|$|The opening Test at Brisbane has {{a history}} of having {{important}} psychological effects on the teams. The four England teams before ours had all lost there. Even Len Hutton's eventually victorious side went down there by an innings. We drew the match <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> this was the turning point of our tour. Nobody expected us to come out of it with our pride intact.|$|E
60|$|She slipped {{closer to}} me then, with that soft sinuousness of a woman, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> she might have kissed me had I not held back, toying with my happiness.|$|R
60|$|In {{the fairy}} tale the beast {{suddenly}} drops his skin and is a prince, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> it seemed to Babbie that some such change had come over this man, her plaything.|$|R
60|$|She was, as in my uneducated way I have observed, very {{beautiful}} women almost always to be, so composed, that her composure gave great weight {{to what she}} said, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> it.|$|R
25|$|As {{the miners}} work only {{six in the}} twenty-four hours in the mines, and as the barrenness of the soil affords little scope for {{agricultural}} pursuits, they have of course abundance of time for reading: <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> they generally employ it to good purpose; {{for many of them}} can converse upon historical, scientific, and theological points so as to astonish a stranger; and even on political questions, they express their opinions with great acuteness and accuracy.|$|E
25|$|I am {{neither a}} prophet, nor {{the son of}} a prophet, yet I will venture to predict that in five years we shall make the journey hence to Quebec and Montreal, and home through Portland and St. John, by rail; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that many in this room will live to hear the whistle of the steam engine in the passes of the Rocky Mountains, and to make the journey from Halifax to the Pacific in five or six days.|$|E
25|$|I {{have the}} {{greatest}} consideration for the goals which are pursued by the physicists of the latest generation which go {{under the name of}} quantum mechanics, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that this theory represents a profound level of truth, but I also believe that the restriction to laws of a statistical nature {{will turn out to be}} transitory....Without doubt quantum mechanics has grasped an important fragment of the truth and will be a paragon for all future fundamental theories, for the fact that it must be deducible as a limiting case from such foundations, just as electrostatics is deducible from Maxwell's equations of the electromagnetic field or as thermodynamics is deducible from statistical mechanics.|$|E
60|$|Sergeant Corney {{had used}} a good many words in {{replying}} to my short question, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> he had done so to the end that I might not fully understand what he meant.|$|R
5000|$|Tippin's last {{release for}} Lyric Street {{was a single}} {{entitled}} [...] "Come Friday", which was slated to be included on an album entitled <b>I</b> <b>Believed.</b> The single peaked at No. 42 on the country charts, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Believed</b> was not released; by 2005, he had exited Lyric Street.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I {{said under}} bad influence. I was told so; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> {{it at the}} time. I hope it's not true, Marmaduke. If it is not, I beg your pardon with all my heart." ...|$|R
25|$|I {{must tell}} you that in Mauritania, freedom is total: freedom of thought, {{equality}} – of all men and women of Mauritania... in all cases, especially with this government, this is in the past. There are probably former relationships – slavery relationships and familial relationships from old days and of the older generations, maybe, or descendants who wish to continue to be in relationships with descendants of their old masters, for familial reasons, or out of affinity, and maybe also for economic interests. But (slavery) is something that is totally finished. All people are free in Mauritania and this phenomenon no longer exists. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that I can tell you that no one profits from this commerce.|$|E
500|$|... "Walter <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that {{education}} {{is the foundation of}} a democratic society. When asked what motivates his philanthropic work, my husband has responded with a very powerful statement: 'I regard my philanthropic work as an investment in the future of America. It is the most effective way I can serve my country and help to ensure its benefits for the next generation.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Ishii {{said he was}} {{a member}} of the Unification Church [...] "just like a Catholic is a member of the Catholic Church <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> Rev.

6000|$|If Darius {{had been}} captured, {{then it was}} in the [...] "stone house" [...] he must be confined, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> our search would be at an end if we could look into every portion of that building.|$|R
60|$|Jacob's eyes twinkled with {{satisfaction}} {{when he heard}} this proposition, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> he was thinking that if we lay in hiding a full day {{in front of the}} fortification, he might have opportunity to learn something concerning his father.|$|R
500|$|As {{the player}} {{representative}} for the Washington Capitals during the 2012 NHL-NHLPA CBA negotiations, Laich stated {{in support of the}} National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) that, [...] "At some point you have to dig your heels in and fight. If we don’t this time, then what happens next? Appeasement only makes the aggressor more aggressive, and the players really understand that. We believe in our cause and our leadership <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> we’re more unified this time and ready for a fight." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2011, President Michel Martelly of Haiti awarded Clinton {{with the}} National Order of Honour and Merit {{to the rank}} of Grand Cross [...] "for his various {{initiatives}} in Haiti and especially his high contribution to the reconstruction of the country after the earthquake of January 12, 2010". Clinton declared at the ceremony that [...] "in the United States of America, I really don't believe former American presidents need awards anymore, but I am very honored by this one, I love Haiti, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> in its promise".|$|E
500|$|In {{the course}} of my journeys, I observe that I receive upon an average two-thirds {{counterfeit}} halfpence for change at toll-gates, etc. <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> the evil is daily increasing, as the spurious money is carried into circulation by the lowest class of manufacturers, who pay with it the principal part of the wages of the poor people they employ. [...] They purchase from the subterraneous coiners 36 shillings'-worth of copper (in nominal value) for 20 shillings, so that the profit derived from the cheating is very large.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{tried to}} make me believe you cared for me, by {{everything}} you could do. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> did <b>believe</b> you then; <b>and</b> yes, <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> you afterwards, when I didn't know what to believe. You were the one true {{thing in the world}} to me. But it seems that you didn't believe it yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ingleby winced, {{but there}} was still no {{wavering}} in his eyes. [...] "I do not know," [...] he said. [...] "You are the most beautiful woman <b>I</b> ever met, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>I</b> did. Most likely your beauty and all that you stood for dazzled me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> lost my head. It may have been that--I do not know--for if I had really loved you I should, perhaps, have forgiven you everything." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{can well}} be {{supposed}} that we held our peace {{as we approached}} the point and heard the cries of the sentinels on the shore, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> of a verity that we could not put the skiff aground without being halted.|$|R
