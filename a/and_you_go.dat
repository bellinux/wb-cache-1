With a game, the fourth, fifth, sixth, 80th, 100 millionth time you've seen that joke it becomes not funny, then you lose faith in it, {{and then you}} {{question}} it, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> round this emotional circle...We've always liked fresh-baked stuff a little better but, with a video game, it doesn't work that way. But the game isn't just a collection of funny South Park scenes, hopefully it's more than that.|$|E

500|$|... {{was about}} how when my grandma was {{standing}} over my grandfather {{while he was}} dying. There was this moment where I felt like he had sort of {{looked at her and}} reckoned that he had won in life. Like, 'I'm a champion. We won. Our love made us a winner.' They were married 60 years. I thought about that idea, that the glorious moment of your life is when you decide that it's okay to go, you don’t have any more words to say, more business, more mountains to climb. You're on the cliff, you tip your hat to yourself <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>go.</b> That’s what it was for me in that moment when I witnessed it." ...|$|E

500|$|She {{just sort}} of sits there with her {{cigarette}} and her hair, and she would pull stuff— these very disparate elements— and put them together into this ensemble, and you'd go, [...] "Come on, Pat, you can't wear that with that." [...] She'd say, [...] "Eh, just try it on." [...] So you'd put it on, and {{not only did it}} work, but it works on so many different levels— and it allows you to figure out who the guy is. Those outfits achieve exactly what I was trying to achieve. There's flamboyance, there's real risk-taking, but when I walk into the room, it's not flashy. It's actually very subtle. You look at it <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>go,</b> [...] "That shirt, that tie, that jacket, that vest? What?" [...] But it works.|$|E
500|$|Simpson {{looked to}} herself for {{inspiration}} when writing [...] "Little Miss Obsessive", which chronicles the [...] "ostensibly aural dance" [...] {{of a couple}} [...] "who break up to make up – and like it". Of the song's concept, Simpson commented: [...] "It's what we can all become in a relationship sometimes. We put our foot in our mouths and we wish we didn't — 'No, I didn't mean to say it. I take it back. I take it back.'" [...] According to Simpson, the song [...] "kind of relates to the last album , but it grew with the new record. And every girl has gone through that situation. You put your foot in your mouth <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>go,</b> 'Wait, why did I do that?' We're on our phones writing and texting too much!" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1973, {{while still}} grieving {{the loss of}} her daughter, Rice took a {{previously}} written short story and turned it into her first novel, the bestselling Interview with the Vampire. She based her vampires on Gloria Holden's character in Dracula's Daughter: [...] "It established to me what vampires were—these elegant, tragic, sensitive people. I was really just going with that feeling when writing Interview With the Vampire. I didn't do a lot of research." [...] After completing the novel and following many rejections from publishers, Rice developed obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). She became obsessed with germs, thinking that she contaminated everything she touched, engaged in frequent and obsessive hand washing and obsessively checked locks on windows and doors. Of this period, Rice says, [...] "What you see when you're in that state is every single flaw in our hygiene and you can't control it <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> crazy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are exhibiting {{symptoms}} of infidelity," [...] she declared. [...] "Your flirtation with Naida this afternoon was most pronounced, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> {{out of your}} way to ask her to dine to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{whole lot}} better off," [...] Bertie sneered. [...] "You've got labour down and gouged it every time you got a chance, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> {{out of your way}} to make chances." ...|$|R

500|$|At Warren's first Banking Committee {{hearing in}} February 2013, she pressed several banking {{regulators}} to answer {{when they had}} last taken a Wall Street bank to trial and stated, [...] "I'm really concerned that 'too big to fail' has become 'too big for trial'." [...] Videos of Warren's questioning became popular on the Internet, amassing {{more than one million}} views in a matter of days. At a Banking Committee hearing in March, Warren asked Treasury Department officials why criminal charges were not brought against HSBC for its money laundering practices. With her questions being continually dodged, Warren compared money laundering to drug possession, saying: [...] "If you're caught with an ounce of cocaine, the chances are good you're going to go to jail... But evidently, if you launder nearly a billion dollars for drug cartels and violate our international sanctions, your company pays a fine <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> home and sleep in your own bed at night." ...|$|E
500|$|After leaving Fez, {{the band}} {{recorded}} in Hanover Quay Studios in Dublin, Platinum Sound Recording Studios in New York City, and Olympic Studios in London. Steve Lillywhite {{was brought in}} to produce a few tracks during these subsequent sessions. In pre-release interviews, U2 compared the extent of their expected shift in musical style to that of Achtung Baby. The band scaled back these experimental pursuits, however; Mullen,Jr. noted, [...] "at a certain stage, reality hits, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>go,</b> 'What are we gonna do with this stuff?' Are we going to release this sort of meandering experimentation, or are we gonna knock some songs out of this?" [...] Bono shared this opinion, stating, [...] "We went so far out on the Sufi singing and the sort of ecstatic-music front, that we had to ground it and find a counterpoint." [...] Eno commented that many of [...] "the more contemplative and sonically adventurous songs" [...] had been dropped, attributing the lack of African-inspired music to its sounding [...] "synthetic" [...] and unconvincing when paired with other songs.|$|E
2500|$|... "I'll {{often hear}} things, melodies <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> {{to do them}} on piano and you can't. There are {{things that you can}} do where you can sing an {{overtone}} over the drone. It's amazing and its a bit like a voice. I'm looking at the theories of soundwaves and extending the range." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} Ida, taking it, [...] "I remember. It was in {{the long}} drift, five years ago, on a windy afternoon, when my hat blew over the hedge <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> to fetch it." ...|$|R

2500|$|The T0 axiom {{is special}} {{in that it}} can be not only added to a {{property}} (so that completely regular plus T0 is Tychonoff) but also subtracted from a property (so that Hausdorff minus T0 is R1), in a fairly precise sense; see Kolmogorov quotient for more information. When applied to the separation axioms, this leads to the relationships in the table to the left below. In this table, you go from the right side to the left side by adding the requirement of T0, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> from the left side to the right side by removing that requirement, using the Kolmogorov quotient operation. (The names in parentheses given {{on the left side of}} this table are generally ambiguous or at least less well known; but they are used in the diagram below.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Tinderbox {{would be}} later hailed by Jean-Benoît Dunckel of Air. He {{selected}} Tinderbox for his [...] "5 albums forever" [...] list, saying, [...] "They played so well together; I saw them in concert and I never forgot that moment". Billy Howerdel of A Perfect Circle rated {{it as his}} all-time favourite album [...] Howerdel described it as [...] "one of the spookiest records I've ever heard. Some of the songs on there have such a dense atmosphere. Sometimes when I'm stuck, I'll listen to that. It's like sometimes when you have no inspiration <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> out {{and look at the}} moon, that's kind of what that record is for me". Jenny Lee Lindberg [...] of Warpaint cited the band among her influences, as well as the song [...] "Umbrella", initially included in the track listing of the 1986 CD version. She said: [...] "This is a song that my husband and I bonded over – we’d definitely heard it individually before, but one day we were just playing the album and that song stopped us in our tracks… played it on repeat for the whole night. I understand why some people can hear a little Siouxsie in what we do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gartside's {{change in}} beliefs {{directly}} affected {{the music and}} particularly the lyrics of Songs to Remember. In one interview with NME in October 1981 he told the paper, [...] "The politics have moved from an essentialist and reductionist position in which we believed in a history of science which could {{make sense of the}} future to one that realized that what you've got is needs, demands, and desires, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> out and you fight for them. Which means that your music will at points be indexed fairly clearly to Politics with a big 'P' and at other points will cut across it completely." [...] In another interview with The Face the following year Gartside said, [...] "My loss has been political conviction, the idea of a correct understanding of the past, present and future (Marxism). I've always been obsessively concerned that my understanding of political truth should be scientifically grounded. Many songs [...] are about what happens when the anchor points of political, moral or religious understanding fall away." [...] For example, he stated that the track [...] "Faithless" [...] was about [...] "how living without faith brings you both happiness and sadness. I've never had any religion, except maybe politics, although I am interested in having some means of achieving social order and progress." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{son of the}} earth! <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> to Cambridge--are {{reported}} to have gone in for the thing, or phantom, called the tripos, and taken a first class! [...] . Did you ever look out the word [...] "prophetes" [...] in Liddell and Scott?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What a disgraceful scene!" [...] said Lady Lufton. [...] "To {{those who}} {{remember}} {{the good old}} man {{who was in the}} diocese before him it is perfectly shocking. He confirmed <b>you,</b> Ludovic, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> ought to remember him. It was over at Barchester, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>and</b> lunched with him afterwards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good,' {{said the}} Bishop. 'You're a great man, Wilson. You {{can make a}} small {{selection}} of those biscuits, <b>and</b> if <b>you</b> bag all the sugar ones I'll slay <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> then <b>you</b> can <b>go</b> quietly downstairs, and rejoin your sorrowing friends. <b>And</b> don't <b>you</b> <b>go</b> telling them what I've been saying.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Richie {{said that}} about halfway through the reveal episode, Alfie [...] "resigns himself {{to the fact that}} it's over between Kat and Alfie, there is no going back", and said that Neilson said halfway through the 15-minute scene that Alfie would be thinking, [...] "I {{understand}} you've done this with somebody... We can get over this... What do you mean... it's been going on for months? We can get over it, because I know you don't love him... What, you love this guy? It's someone we know? Someone in the pub...?", and said that Alfie needs to know who it is for his own peace of mind, though [...] "his whole life just crumbles in his hands". Richie said that viewers would be surprised by the final reveal, stating that [...] "it's really interesting about how we play the Branning card as to which one of them it is. The way it's worded, you believe it's one brother in particular and then that all changes <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>go,</b> 'oh it's him!' Because we make people believe it's another Branning—the way its worded, the way I face up to one of them. The audience will all think it's one person in particular, but then I throw a curve ball and it all kicks off. It's great." [...] Richie said that Alfie cannot understand why Kat is having an affair with Derek, which [...] "makes him sick". He also stated that viewers would find out in January 2013 why Kat had the affair with the person she did. He said: [...] "It's an ongoing story, which is really interesting, to see why Kat was with Alfie and why she went for this bloke because they both offer her different things." [...] Richie speculated that the reason Kat had an affair with Derek is [...] "because Derek is the total polar opposite of Alfie" [...] and Kat is [...] "attracted to danger", which is not like Alfie, and Kat is [...] "used to danger, she's used to excitement. What she got from Alfie was the fairytale, what she wanted was the nightmare". However, the reasons for Kat having the affair were never explained on screen.|$|E

Then I was on the shelf <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> over my head. That's all I knew, until Stannard joined me and took control." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Though I couldn't {{resist the}} temptation to tease you, I quite agree with the Sentinel," [...] she resumed. [...] "It really was a very gallant rescue, <b>and</b> I suppose <b>you</b> know I {{recognize}} my debt to you. I was a little too startled to speak about it when you brought my father home, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> away so fast." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will," [...] she {{answered}} triumphantly. [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>went</b> out this evening I thought that as baby was asleep I would {{see where you}} were going to so mysteriously without telling me. So I ran out <b>and</b> followed behind <b>you.</b> You stopped at the place where the road forks, looked round at the bonfires, and then said, 'Damn it, I'll go!' <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> quickly up the left-hand road. Then I stood and watched you." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Go {{to dress}} {{or you will}} be late for dinner," [...] he said still rather sternly, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>went.</b> But when <b>you</b> had <b>gone</b> <b>and</b> after we had been {{announced}} to him, he smiled and added something which I will not repeat to you even now. I think it was about what you did on the Annexation day of which the story had come to him.|$|R
