5000|$|Kitty Morgan of Cincinnati Magazine {{wrote that}} the Hamilton County and state governments were [...] "unsympathetic" [...] to the {{attempted}} incorporation. The manager of the Wright <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>Plant,</b> located on land that Lincoln Heights residents wished to incorporate, also filed an objection {{because he did not}} want the factory to be in a majority black municipality. The communities of Woodlawn, and then Evendale incorporated even though Lincoln Heights' application kept being delayed. They respectively took the western and eastern portions of territory {{that was supposed to be}} in Lincoln Heights, the latter of which contained the <b>aeronautical</b> <b>plant.</b> The persons trying to establish Lincoln Heights failed to successfully challenge the Evendale incorporation in court.|$|E

50|$|During World War I Manly was an {{advisor to}} the British War Office. He also earned about 40 patents in variable-speed {{hydraulic}} drives. In 1919 {{he was president of}} the Society of Automotive Engineers (now SAE International). Following his tenure he did additional engineering research on engines. The Manly Memorial Medal is an annual award given by the SAE for the best paper on <b>aeronautical</b> power <b>plants.</b>|$|R
50|$|Initially, Steinmesch {{worked on}} {{government}} {{projects for the}} City Plan Commission, U.S. Engineers, and U.S. Airforce's <b>Aeronautical</b> Chart <b>Plant</b> in St. Louis. In San Francisco, she worked for the Western Division of USO Building Services in as Associate Building Director during World War II. Later she worked on residential projects for Arts and Crafts architect Henry Higby Gutterson(1884-1954), San Francisco's Redevelopment Agency, and established her own Pasadena office in 1953.|$|R
50|$|Just {{prior to}} World War II, the firm handled a top-secret {{matter for the}} government: the siting of the Wright <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>Plant</b> on what is now General Electric in Evendale. This {{facility}} would employ 20,000 by 1942 and manufacture the aircraft engines responsible {{for much of the}} bombing during the war. Dinsmore & Shohl attorneys handled the massive title work involving hundreds of parcels, all in total secrecy.|$|E
5000|$|Morgan {{wrote that}} the [...] "halcyon days" [...] of Lincoln Heights were the post-World War II period through the 1960s. At that time of {{incorporation}} {{it was the only}} black municipality north of the Mason-Dixon line, prompting Governor of New York Thomas E. Dewey to establish a tour of Lincoln Heights, inviting New York City residents to participate. In the mid-20th century many Lincoln Heights residents worked at the Wright <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>Plant</b> and a nearby chemical plant.|$|E
50|$|The first {{portion of}} the {{expressway}} was built in 1941 - during World War II - to serve the Wright <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>plant</b> in Lockland. It was initially planned to run from Paddock Road (State Route 4) in Carthage north to Cincinnati-Dayton Road (then U.S. Route 25) near Maud, but was only built — almost completely along the old canal — between Galbraith Road and Glendale-Milford Road (then State Route 126. A short extension was built south to Towne Street in Elmwood Place in the late 1940s.|$|E

50|$|Officers {{and civilians}} of the Survey saw service in North Africa, Europe, and the Pacific {{and in the}} defense of North America and its waters, serving as {{artillery}} surveyors, hydrographers, amphibious engineers, beachmasters (i.e., directors of disembarkation), instructors at service schools, and {{in a wide range of}} technical positions. Coast and Geodetic Survey personnel also worked as reconnaissance surveyors for a worldwide aeronautical charting effort, and a Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps officer was the first commanding officer of the Army Air Forces <b>Aeronautical</b> Chart <b>Plant</b> at St. Louis, Missouri. Coast and Geodetic Survey civilians who remained in the United States during the war produced over 100 million maps and charts for the Allied forces. Three Coast and Geodetic Survey officers and eleven members of the agency who had joined other services were killed during the war.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the early}} 1970s the {{squadron}} {{got a few}} more new G-2 aircraft, which were flying with American-made T-33s, which {{have come to the}} squadron from various sides in middle of 1971. In December 1972 the four new ground-attack J-21 Jastreb aircraft came from the SOKO factory at Mostar. In that period pilots of the squadron had about 80 to 4 flight hours. By the 1972 the squadron has received Utva 66 for training of pilots from Reserve Officers School. In 1975 the squadron flew aircraft for the Libyan Air Force for the first time, from Mostar, via Dubrovnik, Brindisi, Palermo and Tripol to Misurata. In 1977 squadron had made five flights to Libya, receiving awards from SOKO factory. In 1977 eight TT-33A aircraft were bought from France and converted at <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>Plant</b> [...] "Zmaj" [...] for pulling the targets. They were used until 1983.|$|E
5000|$|In 1982 the {{squadron}} received the first G-4 Super Galeb aircraft known extended party of prototypes. From six G-4s four were converted at <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>Plant</b> [...] "Zmaj" [...] for pulling the targets, so known under designation N-62T, while other two aircraft were in standard trainer/light attack configuration, {{like the rest}} of the produced Super Galebs. In September 1983, all six G-4 aircraft were relocated to Skopski Petrovac Air Base where they have formed Mixed Aviation Group together with seven Orao aircraft from 353rd Reconnaissance Aviation Squadron of 97th Aviation Brigade. Group was formed to demonstrate these two aircraft types in combat at Joint exercise [...] "Jedinstvo-83". In 1984 pilots of squadron had flown eight G-2 aircraft to Libya from Mostar in formation with Yak-40. Six Super Galeb aircraft from 525th Squadron with six G-4s from 229th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Squadron participated at May Day 1985 parade by flying in formation. By the end of 1986, {{the squadron}} was reinforced with four new G-4s, what has a strong impulse to the development of a squadron, due the first Super Galebs from extended party of prototypes were not armed with cannons and rockets, as they were presented on [...] "Jedinstvo-83" [...] exercise.|$|E
5000|$|From 1941 to 1943, the Curtiss <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>plant</b> in Lockland, Ohio {{produced}} {{aircraft engines}} under wartime contract destined for installation in U.S. Army Air Forces aircraft. [...] Wright officials at Lockland insisted on high engine production levels, {{resulting in a}} significant percentage of engines that did not meet Army Air Forces (AAF) inspection standards. These defective engines were nevertheless approved by inspectors for shipment and installation in U.S. military aircraft. After investigation, it was later revealed that Wright company officials at Lockland had conspired with civilian technical advisers and Army inspection officers to approve substandard or defective aircraft engines for military use. [...] Army Air Forces technical adviser Charles W. Bond was dismissed by the Army in 1943 for [...] "gross irregularities in inspection procedure." [...] Bond would later testify that he had been [...] "wined and dined" [...] by Wright company officials; one of those occasions was the night before Bond fired four AAF engine inspectors another AAF inspector had described as [...] "troublemakers." [...] In 1944, three Army officers, Lt. Col. Frank Constantine Greulich of Detroit, former chief inspection officer for the material command, Major Walter A. Ryan of Detroit, former central states inspection officer, and Major William Bruckmann, a former Cincinnati brewer and resident Army inspections officer at the Wright plant in Lockland were charged with neglect of duty, conspiracy, and giving false testimony in a general court martial. [...] All three men were later convicted of neglect of duty. [...] The story of defective engines had reached investigators working for Sen. Harry Truman's congressional investigative board, the Truman Commission, after several Wright aircraft assembly workers informed on the company; they would later testify under oath before Congress. [...] Arthur Miller's play All My Sons is based on this incident.|$|E
50|$|When the United States entered World War II in December 1941, the Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps again {{suspended}} its peacetime {{activities to}} support the war effort, often seeing front-line service. Over half of all Coast and Geodetic Survey officers were transferred to the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, or United States Army Air Forces, seeing duty in North Africa, Europe, the Pacific, and {{in the defense of}} North America as artillery surveyors, hydrographers, amphibious engineers, beachmasters (directors of disembarkation), instructors at service schools, and {{in a wide variety of}} technical positions. They also served as reconnaissance surveyors for a worldwide aeronautical charting effort, and a Coast and Geodetic Survey officer was the first commanding officer of the Army Air Forces <b>Aeronautical</b> Chart <b>Plant</b> at St. Louis, Missouri. Three officers who remained in Coast and Geodetic Survey service were killed during the war, as were eleven other Survey personnel.|$|R
5000|$|The second chapter {{concerns}} Hachiro Kishu, {{a helicopter}} pilot whose dream {{has been the}} thrill of flying {{and the challenge of}} aerial combat. Stuck to flying recon and traffic patrol on board a Fa-330 gyroglider, Kishu gets his chance when the Metropolitan Polices Aerial Squadron (首都圏上空) is issued a new state-of-the-art assault helicopter prototype (Fa-666 [...] "Jagdhund") and he has been assigned to fly it. Meanwhile, outside Metropolitan Police Public Security Division agents are tracking down a mole within the Metropolitan Police, but before they can arrest him and his accomplices, the Kerberos 9th Platoon [...] "Schweißhund" [...] raids an accomplices house, killing much of the cell, but the mole escapes. When the M.P. Public Security Division agents inform their director Bunmei Muroto, while they have not identified the mole, they uncovered a plot to sabotage the Special Armed Garrisons upcoming aerial demonstration. However, in order to avenge his men who had their mission ruined by the Kerberos, Muroto does not inform the M.P. Defense Divisions ("Capital Area Security Police Agency" [...] in the English adaptation) director Isao Aniya and allows the parade to go on. The Sect mole, revealed to be aircraft mechanic within the <b>Aeronautical</b> Experiments Platoon, <b>plants</b> a bomb on board the Jagdhund prototype, which explodes during the aerial demonstration. Kishu can only watch in horror as his dream falls to the ground.|$|R
