2500|$|Taylor {{had already}} had an {{excellent}} game while being covered by Waters, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was matched up against second stringer Mark Washington, Kilmer sensed a huge opportunity to break the game open. On their next drive, he completed four passes, the last a 45-yard touchdown bomb to Taylor on the second play of the fourth quarter, increasing Washington's lead to 17–3. [...] The Redskins then dominated {{the rest of the}} game, scoring with field goals from Knight on each of their next three drives to make the final score 26–3.|$|E
2500|$|The news of Kitchener's {{death was}} {{received}} with shock {{all over the}} British Empire. A man in Yorkshire committed suicide at the news; a sergeant on the Western Front was heard to exclaim [...] "Now we’ve lost the war. Now we’ve lost the war"; and a nurse wrote home to her family that she knew Britain would win as long as Kitchener lived <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was gone: [...] "How awful it is – a far worse blow than many German victories. So {{long as he was}} with us we knew even if things were gloomy that his guiding hand was at the helm." [...] The King wrote in his diary: [...] "It is indeed a heavy blow to me and a great loss to the nation and the allies." [...] He ordered army officers to wear black armbands for a week.|$|E

6000|$|SIR PETER. Heyday--what's {{the mystery}} now? while he {{appeared}} an incorrigible Rake, you would give your hand {{to no one}} else <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>He's</b> likely to reform I'll warrant You won't have him! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's it!' {{observed}} Mr. Sikes, approvingly; 'women {{can always}} {{put things in}} fewest words.--Except when it's blowing up; and then they lengthens it out. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> thoroughly up to it, let's have some supper, and get a snooze before starting.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{knew when}} [...] "his time was up," [...] as the natives phrased it, {{he would know}} when to redeem his promise to Muriel.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; it {{was poor}} Sam, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is dead I'm {{the only one}} who saw Long Jim there. Do you know if they have found Sam's body?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And,</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{wore his}} own head again, one of the prettiest of the young princesses willingly agreed to marry him; so the wedding {{ceremony}} was performed amidst great rejoicing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, now, Sarah, this is business, you see," [...] {{he argued}} plaintively. [...] "I've been lookin' for a likely man this long while, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> shown up {{it seems to}} me I got a right to give him the hang of what happened." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> somehow, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{had acted}} like this, he was {{surprised}} at himself.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Hedge Fund Homeboys", for {{the first}} time, Beckett starts to soften up for Castle by joking with him about all the schools <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was kicked out of}} <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> become famous, they all claim him as an alumnus. Additionally, Beckett is {{starting}} to be able to 'read' Castle to know some of his 'looks'.|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen, Richard. Your anger {{makes you}} forget many things. Remember {{that he is}} a {{dangerous}} man, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> knows you are in London he holds your liberty, perhaps your life, in his hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It was {{exceedingly}} unfortunate,' said Albinia, {{trying to}} repress her vexation; 'but Gilbert {{must learn to}} have resolution to guard himself. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is come to ask your forgiveness, will you not grant it to him?' ...|$|E
60|$|The act of {{the little}} rat-faced sailor in killing one of his comrades had aroused a strong dislike in Tarzan, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> saw him quarreling with the fine-looking young man his {{animosity}} was still further stirred.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an episode}} of Six Feet Under, the {{character}} Margaret Chenowith says, {{in a conversation with}} her daughter Brenda, [...] "You’ve spent 32 years being your little brother's nursemaid to avoid having any emotional life of your own. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> been put away, you’re gonna have to face your own demons, and, sweetheart, they're legion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Does he?" [...] {{retorted}} Haney. [...] "Well, {{you say to}} {{the governor}} that Mart Haney was a gambler and saloon-keeper during the other 'war,' <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> a mine-owner, with money to hire a regiment of deppyties, his heart is with the red-neckers--just where it was. Owning a paying mine has not changed me heart to a stone." ...|$|R
60|$|In a flash de Vere {{realised}} {{that she}} hadn't known <b>that</b> <b>he</b> didn't know <b>and</b> knew <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> knew.|$|R
6000|$|... 1. 5. The pure spirit shall flow, &c. The spirit {{which once}} was the vital or mental essence--the soul--of Adonais {{came from the}} Eternal Soul, <b>and,</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is dead, is re-absorbed into the Eternal Soul: as such, it is imperishable.|$|E
60|$|Deering {{thought the}} plan good. Neilson was a gambler, but his word went; in fact, Deering {{imagined}} it sometimes {{went with the}} police. Neilson knew the half-world, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had undertaken an awkward job strange helpers would be put to work.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{you must}} {{promise not to}} turn against me. I have {{undergone}} a great deal already about that place.

50|$|The English-language lyrics, {{written by}} Herbert Kretzmer, tell {{of a man}} {{reflecting}} on his life. He recounts how he had wasted his youth on self-centered pursuits, <b>and</b> <b>that,</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is older, {{he will not be}} able to do all <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had planned; this implies <b>that</b> <b>he</b> may be close to his impending death.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile backstage, Nat {{instructed}} Rosalina {{on how to}} {{play his}} new song, [...] "Girl Of My Dreams". Nat and the band come out on to the stage, and tell the audience to give {{a round of applause}} for the Honey Bunnies and the LA Surfers; nobody cheers at all. Then, Nat introduces the song, which is dedicated to a “very special person” (i.e. Rosalina) and notes <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wrote this when he was in pain <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> happy, he can actually enjoy it. The band performs the song, [...] "Girl Of My Dreams [...] " [...] and win the battle of the bands.|$|R
5000|$|Groves also {{reflected}} on the rivalry that day: [...] "We don't need to be friends—I've got friends. ... There's a rivalry when you're going to box <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> no longer a fighter that rivalry isn't there. ... He's a tough man to beat. Sometimes you think you've got him {{and a bit of}} controversy gets in the way and sometimes you're boxing really well, you're in full control, and then one punch and it can change a fight." ...|$|R
60|$|So far {{his action}} in the matter had been a mere boyish freak; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> saw it was likely to become an affair of grave importance, {{involving}} {{the lives of many}} persons, he determined to have nothing further to do with it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did you not hear? Oh, I had forgotten: it came {{in after}} you left the Station. Yes, it's all right: Eric has got his commission; <b>and,</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has {{arranged}} matters with Muriel, he has business in town that must be seen to at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I have. You {{know well}} all that I {{have got to}} tell you. I loved you before he ever saw you; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has gone, I love you better than I ever did. Dear Lily!" [...] and he put {{out his hand to}} her.|$|E
6000|$|... "They do, indeed; and Bob {{has got to}} be {{so large}} <b>and</b> heavy, <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> quite frightens me, sometimes. Do you not think he grows wonderfully like papa?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Possibly," [...] replied Isobel, [...] "for {{our views}} varied upon most points. While {{he was alive}} I gave way to his, to my great loss <b>and</b> sorrow. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is dead I follow my own." ...|$|R
50|$|He is {{what follows}} {{in the hole}} left behind by Iron Man once Tony Stark leaves the world stage. Tony hasn't been around to protect the regular {{interests}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might have during his time running Stark Industries or running S.H.I.E.L.D. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> back, he's {{made it clear he}} doesn't want {{to get back into the}} geo-political side of things necessarily. Detroit Steel is what happens in <b>that</b> absence. <b>He</b> is a sort of Blackwater-meets-NASCAR corporate-sponsored armored enhanced guy available for hire to the highest bidder for whatever cause around the round. Basically, Iron Man's worst nightmare of what he could become. An absolute perversion of everything he is.|$|R
60|$|She had {{not known}} Burke very well, but she had always looked upon him as a fine, manly sailor; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had come to her, she was {{conscious}} of the family feeling which he had spoken of, {{and she was very}} glad to see him.|$|E
60|$|Yes, he {{had always}} hated me; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> knew I was Dora's {{discarded}} lover, he hated me worse than ever. He had got up and taken a bottle from the medicine-chest, I felt certain, and put something else instead of my quinine inside my paper.|$|E
6000|$|He seemed nervous lest, in thus {{announcing his}} intentions, {{he should be}} setting his granddaughter a bad example; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> came to the point, his way of putting the {{suggestion}} that, if she didn't like it, she could live by herself and lump it, was delicate in the extreme.' ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Merrick {{left the}} office in a rather humbled and testy mood. He disliked to ask favors at any time <b>and</b> <b>now</b> felt <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had confided himself to the mercy of this callous aristocrat and met with a {{distinct}} rebuff.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are other}} gentlemen here," [...] said Lambert, {{speaking}} with more firmness <b>and</b> decision <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> encountered inimical glances and {{felt as if}} somehow {{he was on his}} trial before all these people, [...] "and I am not rich enough to afford the luxury of gambling." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{the last}} of the woman-baiters had passed by <b>now,</b> <b>and,</b> {{conscious}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was really behind time, Felix hurried on....|$|R
