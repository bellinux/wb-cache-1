25|$|The primary {{signalling}} {{system is a}} fixed-block cab {{signalling system}} called HKT which transmits data to the trains through low-bandwidth <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>induction</b> <b>loops</b> between the rails. Different frequency combinations encode different target speeds; when a train enters a block with a lower target speed than its current speed it will initiate service braking until the two match. This allows blocks to be much shorter than the full-speed braking distance, but as the braking profile is encoded in the transmitted target speed it only works where all trains have similar braking characteristics.|$|R
5000|$|An {{increasingly}} common application is for providing hearing aid-compatible [...] "assistive listening" [...] telecoil. In this application a loop or series of loops {{is used to}} provide an <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> oscillating magnetic field {{in an area where}} a hearing aid user may be present. Many hearing aids contain a telecoil which allows the user to receive and hear the magnetic field and remove the normal audio signal provided from the hearing aid microphone site. These loops are often referred to as a hearing <b>loop</b> or audio <b>induction</b> <b>loop.</b>|$|R

50|$|An <b>induction</b> or {{inductive}} <b>loop</b> is an electromagnetic communication or {{detection system}} {{which uses a}} moving magnet to induce an electric current in a nearby wire. <b>Induction</b> <b>loops</b> are used for transmission and reception of communication signals, or for detection of metal objects in metal detectors or vehicle presence indicators.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{reproduction}} of audio signals, the signal components of a selected <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> range (1) of an audio signal are concentrated in a narrower <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> range (II). This is achieved by detecting first signal components in the first <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> range (I), generating second signal components in the second <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> range (II), and controlling the amplitude of the second signal components {{in response to the}} amplitude of the first signal components. As a result, dedicated transducers may be used which are particularly efficient in the narrower frequency range. The original frequency range (I) may contain the lower frequency signal components (bass components) of the audio signal...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} the <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> of {{narrow-band}} noise signals with a sinusoidal ITD fluctuation was investigated. To examine this, a subjective experiment was carried out using a match to sample method and stimuli delivered over headphones.

2500|$|Telecoils or T-coils (from [...] "Telephone Coils") {{are small}} devices {{installed}} in hearing aids or cochlear implants. An Audio <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> generates an electromagnetic field {{that can be}} detected by T-coils, allowing audio sources to be directly connected to a hearing aid. The T-coil is intended to help the wearer filter out background noise. They {{can be used with}} telephones, FM systems (with neck <b>loops),</b> and <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> systems (also called [...] "hearing loops") that transmit sound to hearing aids from public address systems and TVs. In the UK and the Nordic countries, hearing loops are widely used in churches, shops, railway stations, and other public places. In the U.S.A., telecoils and hearing loops are gradually becoming more common.

50|$|The {{original}} <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> {{system was}} installed in the Lawns (a hall of residence at Hull University) as a third year project by engineering students. By 1983 the system was fully operational. To cut costs, the students used Coca-Cola bottles as insulation. As a result, by 1993, the <b>loop</b> <b>induction</b> system was no longer functional. In 1994, the engineering team carried out a comprehensive survey {{of the system and}} were able to partially restore it to several of the Lawns halls, as well as fitting a new transmitter to Ferens Hall. The <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> system was abandoned in 1997 after the award of the LPAM licence.|$|R

50|$|The {{station was}} {{originally}} broadcast from a {{landing in the}} Electrical Engineering Department and carried by <b>induction</b> <b>loops</b> {{in all of the}} campus residences. A year after launch the station moved the current studios in Norwood house but still retained the <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> transmitters, which were updated and expanded as new residences were built on campus. Over the years loudspeakers playing URB were added to the campus laundrettes and the students' union coffee shop. In summer 1994 renovations to the Westwood blocks severed the wires to the loops there and after that URB 963 could only be heard in Eastwood, Wessex and Norwood. On 8 February 2001 at 14:49 1449AM URB launched as a low powered AM service covering the whole campus and the remaining <b>induction</b> <b>loops</b> on 963 were switched off. The addition of online and mobile streaming has also given the station a significant boost.|$|R

50|$|The <b>audio</b> <b>frequencies</b> (20 Hz to 15 kHz), often {{referred}} to as the sum channel, would contain the sum of the left front plus left back signals in the left channel and the sum of the right front plus the right back signals in the right channel. In other words, when observing the <b>audio</b> <b>frequencies</b> only, the record appeared to have an ordinary stereo recording.|$|R
25|$|The {{audio quality}} in the airband {{is limited by the}} RF {{bandwidth}} used. In the newer channel spacing scheme, the largest bandwidth of an airband channel might be limited to 8.33kHz, so the highest possible <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> is 4.165kHz. In the 25kHz channel spacing scheme, an upper <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> of 12.5kHz would be theoretically possible. However, most airband voice transmissions never actually reach these limits. Usually, the whole transmission is contained within a 6kHz to 8kHz bandwidth, corresponding to an upper <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> of 3kHz to 4kHz. This frequency, while low compared {{to the top of the}} human hearing range, is sufficient to convey speech. Different aircraft, control towers and other users transmit with different bandwidths and audio characteristics.|$|R
5000|$|URN was {{established}} from the University's Radio Broadcasting Club, who, {{in the late}} 1970s had an hour's slot on BBC Radio Nottingham. The station set up its first studio in the Cherry Tree buildings in 1978 and [...] "University Radio Nottingham" [...] started broadcasting to Hugh Stewart Hall and Cripps Hall of residence on 963 kHz (312m) in November 1979. Additional <b>induction</b> <b>loops</b> were set up {{over the next few}} years in other halls on campus.

5000|$|In the <b>audio</b> <b>{{frequency}}</b> range (below 1-100 kHz), [...] "1/f" [...] noise becomes dominant, which rises like 1/f. Thus, valves {{with low}} noise at high frequency {{do not necessarily}} have low noise in the <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> range. For special low-noise <b>audio</b> valves, the <b>frequency</b> at which 1/f noise takes over is reduced as far as possible, maybe to something like a kilohertz. It can be reduced by choosing very pure materials for the cathode nickel, and running the valve at an optimized (generally low) anode current.|$|R
