5|$|Mobile device {{forensics}} is a sub-branch {{of digital}} forensics relating to recovery of digital evidence or data from <b>a</b> <b>mobile</b> device. It differs from Computer forensics in that <b>a</b> <b>mobile</b> device {{will have an}} inbuilt communication system (e.g. GSM) and, usually, proprietary storage mechanisms. Investigations usually focus on simple data such as call data and communications (SMS/Email) rather than in-depth recovery of deleted data. SMS data from <b>a</b> <b>mobile</b> device investigation helped to exonerate Patrick Lumumba {{in the murder of}} Meredith Kercher.|$|E

5|$|However, it {{is highly}} {{unlikely}} that single-story structures such as mobile homes can have a substantial effect on tornado development or evolution. More people are killed in trailer parks because mobile homes are less able to withstand high winds than permanent structures. Winds which can demolish or roll <b>a</b> <b>mobile</b> home may only cause roof damage to a typical one- or two-family permanent residence. Another likely contributing factor to the continued propagation of this myth is confirmation bias: whenever a new instance of a tornado hitting <b>a</b> <b>mobile</b> home park occurs, media outlets report on it more extensively, ignoring damage to the surrounding area which may not have produced as many casualties.|$|E
