There are many factors {{to be considered}} for each job assignment: sailors' preferences (detailing), commands' requirements (placement) and the numerous policies that affect both sailors and commands, manning priority levels etc. Often this process is fraught with subjectivities, as each resultant job assignment will vary, depending on the detailer making the assignment. It is therefore timely to explore another way of doing business: a 2 - sided matching process that considers sailors' preferences and commands' requirements and assigns sailors to jobs in an equitable and fair manner.

40|$|Data envelopment {{analysis}} (DEA) is a non-parametric {{method for}} measuring the relative efficiency {{of a set of}} decision making units using multiple precise inputs to produce multiple precise outputs. Several extensions to DEA have been made for the case of imprecise data, as well as to improve the robustness of the assessment for these cases. Prevailing robust DEA (RDEA) models are based on mirrored interval DEA models, including two distinct production possibility sets (PPS). However, this approach renders the distance measures incommensurate and violates the standard assumptions for the interpretation of distance measures as efficiency scores. We propose a modified RDEA (MRDEA) model with a unified PPS to overcome the present problem in RDEA. Based on a flexible formulation for the number of variables perturbed, MRDEA calculates the empirical distribution for the interval efficiency for the case of a random number of variables affected. The MRDEA approach also decreases the computational complexity of the RDEA model, as well as significantly increases the discriminatory power of the model without <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> <b>requirements.</b> The properties of the method are demonstrated for four different numerical instances...|$|E

GSP {{does not have}} other sources of overhead or <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> common in {{routing protocol}}s, such as routing packets, geographical information, addressing or explicit route computation. Because of its simple functionality, GSP is a candidate routing protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks.

Complementing GSP implies creating additional protocols that make use of GSP particular characteristics in order to improve performance without additional overhead. The research analyzes the performance of GSP with different topologies, number of hops from source to destination and node densities, and presents one alternative protocol to complement GSP decreasing idle listening, number of duplicate packets in the network and overall energy consumption.

40|$|Household {{consumption}} and expenditure surveys (HCES) are multipurpose surveys that are routinely conducted {{to collect data}} on household food {{consumption and}} availability in more than 120 countries. HCES are increasingly being used to calculate proxy estimates of food consumption, nutrient intakes, and nutrition status, often at the individual level. Rarely, however, do they collect information on meal participation, despite growing evidence that it is an increasingly important and variable component of the quantity of food consumed or available in a household. This paper explores the significance of adjusting for meal participation in making inferences about apparent food consumption and nutrient intakes. It focuses on two distinct sets of <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> for enhancing the reliability and precision of measures of food consumption: (1) individual household members’ and household guests’ meal-eating behaviors, and (2) the number and apparent nutritional significance of meals. While the most comprehensive and precise accounting of intakes of individual food consumption and nutrients requires both types of information, the magnitude of the changes required in HCES questionnaires to capture them is likely to be prohibitive. Consequently, for many HCES, a “second best” approach may be the most effective method, {{at least in the short}} term. The paper empirically explores some of the relatively few HCES that currently attempt to capture some of these information requirements. In addition, it assesses their value-added to prioritize the global agenda for strengthening HCES measurement of food consumption in support of more evidence-based nutrition policy making.

We report that although the liver-specific a 1 -antitrypsin (a 1 AT) gene remains silent despite reactivation of the HNF 4 /HNF 1 a pathway in the M 29 cells, the frequency of activation of an integrated a 1 AT-APRT transgene is increased 1000 -fold in response to these transcription factors. The human a 1 AT locus (introduced via chromosome transfer) also remained silent on these cells, despite HNF 4 and HNF 1 a expression.
