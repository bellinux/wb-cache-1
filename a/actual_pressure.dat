Its barometric pressure recording of 946 mbar (27.96inches) is the most intense from any Atlantic hurricane in June, although Hurricane Audrey in 1957 ties this intensity. Alex is thus tied for the most intense June Atlantic hurricane on record overall. However, as Audrey's pressure was estimated, Audrey's <b>actual</b> <b>pressure</b> might be as low as 925 mbar.|$|E

The Bourdon tube gauge, in which the pressure straightens an oval-section coiled tube of brass or bronze connected to a pointer, was introduced in 1849 and quickly gained acceptance, and is still used today. Some locomotives have an additional pressure gauge in the steam chest. This helps the driver avoid wheel-slip at startup, by warning if the regulator opening is too great.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the stress}} rupture {{reliability}} of Carbon/Epoxy Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels (COPVs) is examined utilizing the classic Phoenix model and {{accounting for the}} differences between the design and the <b>actual</b> burst <b>pressure,</b> and the liner contribution effects. Stress rupture life primarily depends upon the fiber stress ratio which is defined as the ratio of stress in fibers at the maximum expected operating <b>pressure</b> to <b>actual</b> delivered fiber strength. The actual delivered fiber strength is calculated using the <b>actual</b> burst <b>pressures</b> of vessels established through burst tests. However, during the design phase the <b>actual</b> burst <b>pressure</b> is generally not known and to estimate the reliability of the vessels calculations are usually performed based upon the design burst pressure only. Since the design burst is lower than the actual burst, this process yields a much higher value for the stress ratio and consequently a conservative estimate for the reliability. Other complications arise {{due to the fact that}} the <b>actual</b> burst <b>pressure</b> and the liner contributions have inherent variability and therefore must be treated as random variables in order to compute the stress rupture reliability. Furthermore, the model parameters, which have to be established based on stress rupture tests of subscale vessels or coupons, have significant variability as well due to limited available data and hence must be properly accounted for. In this work an assessment of reliability of COPVs including both parameter uncertainties and physical variability inherent in liner and overwrap material behavior is made and estimates are provided in terms of degree of uncertainty in the <b>actual</b> burst <b>pressure</b> and the liner load sharing...|$|R

60|$|There {{was once}} a time when New England groaned under the <b>actual</b> <b>pressure</b> of heavier wrongs than those {{threatened}} ones which brought on the Revolution. James II, the bigoted successor of Charles the Voluptuous, had annulled the charters of all the colonies, and sent a harsh and unprincipled soldier to take away our liberties and endanger our religion. The administration of Sir Edmund Andros lacked scarcely a single characteristic of tyranny: a Governor and Council, holding office from the King, and wholly independent of the country; laws made and taxes levied without concurrence of the people immediate or by their representatives; the rights of private citizens violated, and the titles of all landed property declared void; the voice of complaint stifled by restrictions on the press; and, finally, disaffection overawed by the first band of mercenary troops that ever marched on our free soil. For two years our ancestors were kept in sullen submission by that filial love which had invariably secured their allegiance to the mother country, whether its head chanced to be a Parliament, Protector, or Popish Monarch. Till these evil times, however, such allegiance had been merely nominal, and the colonists had ruled themselves, enjoying far more freedom than is even yet the privilege of the native subjects of Great Britain.|$|E
60|$|The Author of {{the above}} note--having, in justice to the Spaniards, spoken with great plainness and freedom--feels it {{necessary}} to add a few words, {{that it may not}} thence be concluded that he is insensible to Sir J. Moore's claims upon his respect. Perhaps--if Sir J.M. could himself have given us his commentary upon these letters, and have restricted the extension of such passages as (from want of vigilance in making distinctions or laxity of language) are at variance with concessions made elsewhere--they would have been found not more to differ from the reports of other intelligent and less prejudiced observers, than we might have expected from the circumstances under which they were written. Sir J.M. has himself told us (in a letter published since the above note was written) that he thinks the Spaniards 'a fine people;' and that acknowledgement, from a soldier, cannot be supposed to exclude courage; nor, from a Briton, some zeal for national independence. We are therefore to conclude that, when Sir J.M. pronounces opinions on 'the Spaniards' not to be reconciled with this and other passages, he speaks--not of the Spanish people--but of the Spanish government. And, even for what may still remain charged uncandidly upon the people, the writer does not forget that there are infinite apologies to be found in Sir J. Moore's situation: the earliest of these letters were written under great anxiety and disturbance of mind from the anticipation of calamity;--and the latter (which are the most severe) under the <b>actual</b> <b>pressure</b> of calamity; and calamity of that sort which would be the most painful to the feelings of a gallant soldier, and most likely to vitiate his judgment with respect to those who had in part (however innocently) occasioned it. There may be pleaded also for him--that want of leisure which would make it difficult to compare the different accounts he received, and to draw the right inferences from them. But then these apologies for his want of fidelity--are also reasons before-hand for suspecting it: and there are now (May 18th) to be added to these reasons, and their confirmations in the letters themselves, fresh proofs in the present state of Gallicia, as manifested by the late re-capture of Vigo, and the movements of the Marquis de la Romana; all which, from Sir J. Moore's account of the temper in that province, we might have confidently pronounced impossible. We must therefore remember that what in him were simply mis-statements--are now, when repeated with our better information, calumnies; and calumnies so much the less to be excused in us, as we have already (in our conduct towards Spain) given her other and no light matter of complaint against ourselves.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the subjective magnitudes of pressure perceived by a subject who used an ischial containment socket that was self-reported as 2 ̆ 2 comfortable, 2 ̆ 2 and to examine the relationships between perceived <b>pressures</b> and <b>actual</b> <b>pressures.</b> A Borg scale of subjective pressure magnitude (Borg G. Borg 2 ̆ 7 s Perceived Exertion and Pain Scales. Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics, 1998) was used to obtain quantitative estimates of the pressures. The subject was asked to identify for different regions of the socket the phases of gait during which maximum and minimum pressures were experienced and their subjective magnitudes. <b>Actual</b> <b>pressures</b> were measured using the F-Socket pressure sensing system (Tekscan, Inc., South Boston, MA). Most of the subjective magnitudes reported during gait (temporal) for maximum and minimum perceived pressures in the muscle compartments of the socket tended to be consistent with the actual maximum and minimum pressures. Detection of the phases of gait during which maximum and minimum pressures occurred was correct more frequently (temporal changes in pressure during gait) than the detection of differences in pressure between adjacent compartments during a single phase of gait (spatial differences in pressure). In the regions of high pressure, such as Scarpa 2 ̆ 7 s triangle, the ischium, the adductor longus tendon, and the gluteal fold, the subjective identification of phases of gait during which maximum and minimum pressures occurred were less consistent with measured pressures. The manner of loading of the mechanoreceptors (uniform versus a clamping mode of pressure) could explain the differences in perception of the subjective magnitudes of pressure and the apparent underlying psychophysical relationships for different regions of the socket and limb. It was concluded that in a comfortable socket, pressures are not uniform during gait and pressures are not uniform over all regions of the socket. Pressures experienced during static loading cannot be relied upon to indicate what the range of pressures will be and how the socket will feel during gait. Subjective magnitudes may not accurately reflect <b>actual</b> <b>pressures</b> in some regions of the socket. Additional research should be conducted on the relationship between mode of pressure loading (circumferential versus clamping) and perception of pressure, as well as the possible influence of quasi-hydrostatic loading on pressure sensation...|$|R
60|$|The {{character}} of this female suggests a train of thought which will form as natural an Introduction to her story, {{as most of the}} Prefaces to Gay's Fables, or the tales of Prior; besides that, the general soundness of the moral may excuse any want of present applicability. We will not look for a living resemblance of Mrs. Hutchinson, though the search might not be altogether fruitless. But there are portentous indications, changes gradually taking place in the habits and feelings of the gentle sex, which seem to threaten our posterity with many of those public women, whereof one was a burden too grievous for our fathers. The press, however, is now the medium through which feminine ambition chiefly manifests itself; and we will not anticipate the period (trusting to be gone hence ere it arrive) when fair orators shall be as numerous as the fair authors of our own day. The hastiest glance may show how much of the texture and body of cisatlantic literature is the work of those slender fingers from which only a light and fanciful embroidery has heretofore been required, that might sparkle upon the garment without enfeebling the web. Woman's intellect should never give the tone to that of man; and even her morality is not exactly the material for masculine virtue. A false liberality, which mistakes the strong division-lines of Nature for arbitrary distinctions, and a courtesy, which might polish criticism, but should never soften it, have done their best to add a girlish feebleness to the tottering infancy of our literature. The evil {{is likely to be a}} growing one. As yet, the great body of American women are a domestic race; but when a continuance of ill-judged incitements shall have turned their hearts away from the fireside, there are obvious circumstances which will render female pens more numerous and more prolific than those of men, though but equally encouraged; and (limited, of course, by the scanty support of the public, but increasing indefinitely within those limits) the ink-stained Amazons will expel their rivals by <b>actual</b> <b>pressure,</b> and petticoats wave triumphantly over all the field. But, allowing that such forebodings are slightly exaggerated, is it good for woman's self that the path of feverish hope, of tremulous success, of bitter and ignominious disappointment, should be left wide open to her? Is the prize worth her having, if she win it? Fame does not increase the peculiar respect which men pay to female excellence, and there is a delicacy (even in rude bosoms, where few would think to find it) that perceives, or fancies, a sort of impropriety in the display of woman's natal mind to the gaze of the world, with indications by which its inmost secrets may be searched out. In fine, criticism should examine with a stricter, instead of a more indulgent eye, the merits of females at its bar, because they are to justify themselves for an irregularity which men do not commit in appearing there; and woman, when she feels the impulse of genius like a command of Heaven within her, should be aware that she is relinquishing a part of the loveliness of her sex, and obey the inward voice with sorrowing reluctance, like the Arabian maid who bewailed the gift of prophecy. Hinting thus imperfectly at sentiments which may be developed on a future occasion, we proceed to consider the celebrated subject of this sketch.|$|E

The test was based on simultaneous measurement on the same arm with the test device and standard zero or random zero sphygmomanometer in 100 patients. The difference between the blood pressure values measured by the test device and by the standard device was calculated in each case, and a relationship between this difference and the <b>actual</b> blood <b>pressure</b> of the patient was analysed. <b>Actual</b> blood <b>pressure</b> was considered as the average of the blood pressure measured by the test and that by the standard device. Regarding the diastolic values, the mean difference between the values obtained by the test device and the standard zero sphygmomanometer was - 3. 8 +/- 7. 55 mm Hg (p > 0. 05), and that between the test device and the random zero sphygmomanometer was - 0. 1 +/- 6. 05 mm Hg (p > 0. 05). This differences did not reach statistical significance. Regarding the systolic values, the difference showed significant positive correlation with the <b>actual</b> blood <b>pressure</b> level of the patient, meaning that at higher blood pressure values the difference between the data gained by the test and standard device is greater than at lower <b>actual</b> blood <b>pressure</b> levels.
