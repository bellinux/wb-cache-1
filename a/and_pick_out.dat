They groom in greeting, when waking up, when settling in for sleep, {{between mother and}} infant, in juvenile relations, and for sexual advances. Unlike anthropoid primates, who part the fur with the hands <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> particles with the fingers or mouth, lemurs groom with their tongue and scraping with their toothcomb. Despite the differences in technique, lemurs groom with the same frequency and {{for the same reasons}} as anthropoids.|$|E

[...] Noticing the {{direction}} and strength of the wind, Fauconberg ordered all Yorkist archers to step forward and unleash a volley of their arrows from what would be the standard maximum range of their longbows. With the wind behind them, the Yorkist missiles travelled farther than usual, plunging deep into the masses of soldiers on the hill slope. The response from the Lancastrian archers was ineffective as the heavy wind blew snow in their faces. They found it difficult to judge the range <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> their targets and their arrows fell short of the Yorkist ranks; Fauconberg had ordered his men to retreat after loosing one volley, thus avoiding any casualties.

Smith brought in braces and a tweed jacket; Holman believed that the tweed jacket was [...] "a bit old for him" [...] but showed that he was a [...] "professor and student at the same time" [...] and gave him [...] "that quality that the Doctor's still learning, but also has some authority". Smith suggested a bow tie, which Holman and others did not approve of, but once he had put it on they decided they had the costume. Smith stated he was inspired by the Second Doctor's costume after watching The Tomb of the Cybermen. Other influences included the [...] "element of a professor" [...] and [...] "big, dusty boots like Indiana Jones".

Gugerty’s group also showed, in a sentence comprehension study, that ClearType boosted reading speed by 5 percent and comprehension by 2 percent.

[...] Cinematographer Roger Deakins, discussing his use of zoom lenses, commented, [...] "I would find it quite exciting to shoot a film with a zoom lens if it was that observational, roving kind of look that Robert Altman was known for.

In contrast, discriminating an object from all others can be done by just ascribing some predicate to it that does not apply to the others. <b>Picking</b> <b>out</b> an object does not even seem to require to distinguish it from all others.
