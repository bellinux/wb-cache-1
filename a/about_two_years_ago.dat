In June 2009, he joined Dundee United on a free transfer, signing a two-year deal with the Scottish Premier League club. Dundee United manager Craig Levein stated [...] "I am excited about the signing and I am sure he will develop into a real talent. Jennison is a player I've known about and admired for some time and up to <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> I would have said {{he was one of the}} brightest prospects in the country. He is a player who will not only excite the fans with his direct, quick running at defences, but he will also add pace to the team and strengthen our options going forward". Myrie-Williams made his Dundee United debut on 22 August 2009, coming on as an 88th-minute substitute in a 0–0 draw at St Mirren.

He scored his first competitive goal for Dundee United in a 3–2 home win against St Mirren on 5 December 2009, scoring the club's third with a neat finish. He was on the scoresheet again in January 2010, scoring in a game against St Johnstone, Myrie-Williams' goal gave Dundee United the lead after trailing 2–0 at half-time, although the game ended 3–3.
