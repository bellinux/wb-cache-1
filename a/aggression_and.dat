5|$|Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a {{genre of}} rock music that {{developed}} in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with <b>aggression</b> <b>and</b> machismo.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} show the {{differences}} between communication styles, Rosenberg started to use two animals.

The herbivorous Giraffe on the other hand, represented his NVC strategy. The Giraffe was chosen as symbol for NVC as its long neck is supposed to show the clear-sighted speaker, being aware of his fellow speakers' reactions; and because the Giraffe has a large heart, representing the compassionate side of NVC. In his courses he tended to use these animals {{in order to make the}} differences in communication clearer to the audience.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to compare the levels of anger <b>and</b> <b>aggression</b> between male <b>and</b> female Police Academy {{students}} (N= 106) and male university students (N= 100), using 2 psychometric anger instruments; Novaco Anger Scale- 1998 -S (NAS- 1998 -S) <b>and</b> <b>Aggression</b> Questionnaire-S (AQ-S). Another aim was to examine if there was a difference in anger <b>and</b> <b>aggression</b> between male <b>and</b> female Police Academy students. Questionnaires were handed out to Police Academy students in Växjö and the result was compared to university students from a previous study by Lindqvist, Dåderman & Hellström (2003). Analyses using a series of Independent sample t-tests showed a significantly lower level of anger <b>and</b> <b>aggression</b> in the Police Academy sample. There were no significant difference in anger <b>and</b> <b>aggression</b> between males <b>and</b> females with the exception of two subscales of the NAS- 1998 -S and AQ-S; females scored significantly higher on NAS Arousal and males scored significantly higher on AQ Physical aggression...|$|R

5|$|The {{success of}} meat ants {{depends on what}} {{resource}} they are dealing with. In one study, the removal of meat ants allowed the successful foraging of Iridomyrmex ants at carbohydrate sources, but not for protein baits. The success of the ants also did not increase with mealworm baits, suggesting that competition does not always occur between meat ants and other species, and factors, such as food preference, may be involved. In contrast with camponotines and some myrmicines, both of their success was affected at numerous food sources with meat ants present. Camponotines exhibit no <b>aggression</b> <b>and</b> cannot defend themselves.|$|E
5|$|According to Theravada commentaries, {{there are}} five {{requisite}} factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be both an act of killing and to be karmically negative. These are: (1) {{the presence of a}} living being, human or animal; (2) the knowledge that the being is a living being; (3) the intent to kill; (4) the act of killing by some means; and (5) the resulting death. Some Buddhists have argued on this basis that the act of killing is complicated, and its ethicization is predicated upon intent. Some have argued that in defensive postures, for example, the primary intention of a soldier is not to kill, but to defend against <b>aggression,</b> <b>and</b> the act of killing in that situation would have minimal negative karmic repercussions.|$|E

5|$|An {{observational}} study by Logan {{demonstrates that the}} female is continuously {{evaluating the quality of}} the male and his territory. The assessment is usually triggered by the arrival of a new male in a neighboring territory {{at the beginning of a}} new breeding season. In those cases, the mated female is constantly seen flying over both the original and the new male’s territory, evaluating the qualities of both territories and exchanging calls with both males. The social mate displays aggressive behaviors towards the female, while the new male shows less <b>aggression</b> <b>and</b> sings softer songs. At the same time, both the mated male and the new male will fly over other territories to attract other females as well. Divorce, mate switching and extra-pair matings do occur in northern mockingbirds.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, {{after two}} years in the largely rural diocese of Hereford, Henson {{returned}} to Durham as its bishop. The industrial north-east of England, including County Durham, was badly affected by an economic depression. Henson was opposed to strikes, trade unions and socialism, and for a time his forthright expression of his views made him unpopular in the diocese. His opinions about some Church matters changed radically during his career: at first a strong advocate of the Church of England's continued establishment as the country's official church, he came to believe that politicians could not be trusted to legislate properly on ecclesiastical matters, and he espoused the cause of disestablishment. He campaigned against efforts to introduce prohibition, exploitation of foreign workers by British companies, and fascist and Nazi <b>aggression,</b> <b>and</b> supported reform of the divorce laws, a controversial revision of the Book of Common Prayer and ecumenism.|$|E
5|$|In a 1649 treaty the Dutch had {{pledged to}} defend Denmark against unprovoked <b>aggression,</b> <b>and</b> from a Swedish {{point of view}} it was {{essential}} to establish naval supremacy in Øresund to keep the Dutch out should they decide {{to intervene in the}} conflict. Kronborg Castle sat near the narrowest part of Øresund, a sound only four kilometres wide, which gave the castle a supreme strategic importance. Frederick III had appointed the colonel Poul Beenfeldt commander of the castle and ordered him to defend it at all costs. Should he fail in that, Kronborg was to be blown up to prevent the Swedes from using it.|$|E

5|$|Military {{planners}} in Paris {{understood that}} the northern Rhine Valley, the south-western German territories, and Switzerland were strategically important {{for the defense of}} the Republic. The Swiss passes commanded access to northern Italy; consequently, the army that held those passes could move troops to and from northern and southern theaters quickly. The river was a formidable barrier to what the French perceived as Austrian <b>aggression,</b> <b>and</b> the state that controlled its crossings controlled the river itself. Finally, control of the Upper Danube would allow France to move its troops from Italy to the North Sea, or any point in between, offering immense strategic value.|$|E
5|$|Most Iridomyrmex {{species are}} {{aggressive}} ants that will attack anything which attacks or disturbs their nests or trails they forage on. This is noticeable with particular member {{species of the}} I. purpureus species group, where they will pour out of their nest and attack and kill all intruders. Even smaller species show similar behaviours to these ants and will also swarm out of their nests to bite and spray iridomyrmecin, a defensive chemical found in the genus. Because of their large numbers, <b>aggression,</b> <b>and</b> activeness, Iridomyrmex ants are ecologically dominant in Australia, and several species are known to obtain exclusive possession to food sources and prevent other insects from using them. These ants will also affect foraging behaviours of other ant nests living nearby due to how active they are and their large numbers.|$|E
5|$|Reported neuropsychiatric manifestations are anxiety, depression, {{a reduced}} display of {{emotions}} (blunted affect), egocentrism, <b>aggression,</b> <b>and</b> compulsive behavior, {{the latter of}} which can cause or worsen addictions, including alcoholism, gambling, and hypersexuality. Difficulties in recognizing other people's negative expressions have also been observed. The prevalence of these symptoms is highly variable between studies, with estimated rates for lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders between 33% and 76%. For many sufferers and their families, these symptoms {{are among the most}} distressing aspects of the disease, often affecting daily functioning and constituting reason for institutionalization. Suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts are more common than in the general population. Often individuals have reduced awareness of chorea, cognitive and emotional impairments.|$|E
