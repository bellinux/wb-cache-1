60|$|Paul Ruttledge. Well, good-bye, Thomas; I don't suppose I'll see you again. Use all I have; {{spend it}} on your children; I'll never want it. [To the others.] <b>Will</b> you come <b>and</b> <b>join</b> <b>us?</b> We <b>will</b> find rags for you all.

I <b>will</b> be waiting for you about two miles off the land, and will show a light to seaward so that you will know where to find me. Then we can talk matters over, and you can get back to the other side again before morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Harris, this is ver', ver' pleasant. I {{had almost}} {{forgotten}} you were coming," [...] Mother said, languidly.... Harris {{could not know}} that the distinguished pedestrian, actor, impresario, and capitalist, Mr. Seth Appleby, had spent two hours and seventeen minutes in training the unwilling Mother to deliver this speech.

Would you like to wash up <b>and</b> <b>join</b> <b>us?</b> Seth dear, <b>will</b> you ring for Lena and have her take dear Harris's bag to his room?
