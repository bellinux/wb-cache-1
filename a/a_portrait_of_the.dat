5|$|On 7 January 1904 Joyce {{attempted}} to publish <b>A</b> <b>Portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Artist, an essay-story dealing with aesthetics, {{only to have}} it rejected by the free-thinking magazine Dana. He decided, on his twenty-second birthday, to revise the story into a novel he called Stephen Hero. It was a fictional rendering of Joyce's youth, but he eventually grew frustrated with its direction and abandoned this work. It was never published in this form, but years later, in Trieste, Joyce completely rewrote it as <b>A</b> <b>Portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Artist as a Young Man. The unfinished Stephen Hero was published after his death.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Artist as a Young Man is {{a nearly}} {{complete}} rewrite {{of the abandoned}} novel Stephen Hero. Joyce attempted to burn the original manuscript {{in a fit of}} rage during an argument with Nora, though to his subsequent relief it was rescued by his sister. A Künstlerroman, Portrait is a heavily autobiographical coming-of-age novel depicting the childhood and adolescence of protagonist Stephen Dedalus and his gradual growth into artistic self-consciousness. Some hints of the techniques Joyce frequently employed in later works, such as stream of consciousness, interior monologue, and references to a character's psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings are evident throughout this novel.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 Christiaan Schuckman {{discovered}} {{a set of}} signed plates in Madrid that {{can be attributed to}} the engraver of the First Folio portrait. These plates bear Droeshout's signature and are stylistically similar to his portrait of Shakespeare. (They include <b>a</b> <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> priest and writer Franciso de la Peña that has a striking resemblance to the English poet). On the evidence of these plates, which were made between 1635 and 1639, Schuckman attributed the portrait of Shakespeare to the younger Martin and suggested that the engraver had converted to Catholicism and emigrated to Spain in 1635, where he continued to work.|$|E
5|$|In Pseudo-Kodinos' work, the Domestic of the Schools ranks 31st in the {{imperial}} hierarchy, between the mystikos and the Grand Drungary of the Fleet.

5|$|Stela 4 is {{dated to}} AD 396, {{during the reign}} of Yax Nuun Ayiin after the {{intrusion}} of Teotihuacan in the Maya area. The stela displays a mix of Maya and Teotihuacan qualities, and deities from both cultures. It has <b>a</b> <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king with the Underworld Jaguar God under one arm and the Mexican Tlaloc under the other. His helmet is a simplified version of the Teotihuacan War Serpent. Unusually for Maya sculpture, but typically for Teotihuacan, Yax Nuun Ayiin is depicted with a frontal face, rather than in profile.|$|E

5|$|The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel {{written by}} American author F. Scott Fitzgerald that follows {{a cast of}} {{characters}} living in the fictional town of West Egg on prosperous Long Island {{in the summer of}} 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald's magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating <b>a</b> <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties that {{has been described as a}} cautionary tale regarding the American Dream.|$|E
5|$|Triptych, May–June 1973 is a {{triptych}} {{completed in}} 1973 by the Irish-born artist Francis Bacon (1909–1992). The oil-on-canvas was painted {{in memory of}} Bacon's lover George Dyer, who committed suicide {{on the eve of}} the artist's retrospective at Paris's Grand Palais on 24 October 1971. The triptych is <b>a</b> <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moments before Dyer's death from an overdose of pills in their hotel room. Bacon was haunted and preoccupied by Dyer's loss for the remaining years of his life and painted many works based on both the actual suicide and the events of its aftermath. He admitted to friends that he never fully recovered, describing the 1973 triptych as an exorcism of his feelings of loss and guilt.|$|E
5|$|Although a court roll of 1389 {{mentions}} two gardens, {{there is}} no record of where these were sited, nor is there any record of when the terraces were constructed. The basic layout as known today was certainly in place by about 1730, {{as can be seen in}} <b>a</b> <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house from that period. Later in the 18th century, the space behind the great pilastered wall was infilled to make the top terrace, which has wide views across the valley to the Mendip Hills beyond. The Octagon, a garden pavilion, was built about the same time, as was the more rustic summer house which faces it down the long grassy walk of the Pretty Terrace. Further modifications involved facing the lower retaining wall with rosy pink bricks, which were also used to build a double flight of steps below the Octagon. The garden is still largely in its 18th-century form, though small ponds and fountains were added in the 19th century and the once open hillside behind is now thickly wooded. A single rose arbour remained from the Edwardian garden but was on the verge of collapse when it was replaced with a new one in 2009, marking 300 years of the Elton family's presence at Clevedon Court.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-14th century Book of Offices of Pseudo-Kodinos, the prōtostratōr is {{the fifth}} highest non-imperial office (eighth overall), coming after the megas doux and before the megas logothetes. Its {{insignia}} of office {{were similar to those}} of the megas doux, i.e. a rich silk kabbadion tunic, a golden-red skiadion hat decorated with embroideries in the klapoton style, without veil, or a domed skaranikon hat, again in red and gold and decorated with golden wire, with <b>a</b> <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emperor standing in front, and another of him enthroned in the rear. Only his staff of office (dikanikion) differed, with only the topmost carved knots in gold, and the rest in silver. The knobs in the staff remained gold, bordered with silver braid. According to Pseudo-Kodinos, the prōtostratōr retained some functions, mostly ceremonial, echoing his origin as a stable master: he carried the emperor's sword, he led the emperor's horse when he left the palace, although the actual responsibility for the emperor's horses now rested with the komēs tōn basilikōn hippōn ("count of the imperial horses"). In war, the prōtostratōr was responsible for the irregulars ("those who have neither order nor their own banner") and scouts who preceded the army.|$|E
5|$|Phan Quang Đán {{joined the}} {{rebellion}} and acted as the rebels' spokesman. The most prominent political critic of Diệm, Đán had been disqualified from the 1959 legislative election after winning his seat by {{a ratio of}} 6:1 despite Diệm having organised votestacking against him. He cited political mismanagement of {{the war against the}} Viet Cong and the government's refusal to broaden its political base as the reason for the revolt. Đán spoke on Radio Vietnam and staged a media conference during which a rebel paratrooper pulled <b>a</b> <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> president from the wall, ripped it and stamped on it. In the meantime, Thuy went about organising a coalition of political parties to take over post-Diệm. He had already lined up the VNQDĐ, Đại Việt, and the Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài religious movements, and was seeking more collaborators.|$|E
5|$|Several {{portraits of}} Octavius survive. Five portraits of him alone {{and one with}} his brother Alfred are housed in the Royal Collection of the United Kingdom. The first is the more famous {{painting}} by Thomas Gainsborough in 1782, {{which is part of}} a series of paintings of the younger royal children. The second one is after the 1782 portrait by Gainsborough (see above) and is dated to about 1782 or 1784. The third portrait is by Benjamin West and was painted shortly before Octavius's death. Furthermore, among these five portraits, there are two enamels, both after Gainsborough's 1782 portrait; one is by William Bone and the other one is by an anonymous master. The sixth and last portrait represents the apotheosis of Octavius and Alfred (see above) and was painted by West. Another portrait, this time of Queen Charlotte, features Octavius. Painted in 1779 by West, this is both <b>a</b> <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Queen and her children, who are featured in the background. Prince Octavius is at the centre of the group, wearing baby clothes and riding in a little phaeton. He is pulled along by Prince Ernest and pushed by Prince Adolphus.|$|E
