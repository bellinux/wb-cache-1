This occurs partly because random {{mutations}} {{arise in the}} genome of an individual organism, and offspring can inherit such mutations.

The environment of a genome includes the molecular biology in the cell, other cells, other individuals, populations, species, as well as the <b>abiotic</b> <b>environment.</b> Individuals with certain variants of the trait may survive and reproduce more than individuals with other, less successful, variants; therefore, the population evolves.

25|$|After {{being exposed}} to air and water, {{oxidation}} of metal sulfides (often pyrite, which is iron-sulfide) within the surrounding rock and overburden generates acidity. Colonies of bacteria and archaea greatly accelerate the decomposition of metal ions, although the reactions also occur in an <b>abiotic</b> <b>environment.</b> These microbes, called extremophiles {{for their ability to}} survive in harsh conditions, occur naturally in the rock, but limited water and oxygen supplies usually keep their numbers low. Special extremophiles known as Acidophiles especially favor the low pH levels of abandoned mines. In particular, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is a key contributor to pyrite oxidation.|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of competitive ability of invasive plant species is generally {{studied in the}} context of adaptive responses to novel biotic environments (enemy release) in introduced ranges. However, invasive plants may also respond to novel <b>abiotic</b> <b>environments.</b> Here we studied differences in competitive ability between Chromolaena odorata plants of populations from nonnative versus native ranges, considering biogeographical differences in both biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>environments.</b> An intraspecific competition experiment was conducted at two nutrient levels in a common garden. In both low and high nutrient treatments, C. odorata plants from nonnative ranges showed consistently lower root to shoot ratios than did plants from native ranges grown in both monoculture and competition. In the low nutrient treatment, C. odorata plants from nonnative ranges showed significantly lower competitive ability (competition-driven decreases in plant height and biomass were more), which was associated with their lower root to shoot ratios and higher total leaf phenolic content (defense trait). In the high nutrient treatment, C. odorata plants from nonnative ranges showed lower leaf toughness and cellulosic contents (defense traits) but similar competitive ability compared with plants from native ranges, which was also associated with their lower root to shoot ratios. Our results indicate that genetically based shifts in biomass allocation (responses to <b>abiotic</b> <b>environments)</b> also influence competitive abilities of invasive plants, and provide a first potential mechanism for th...|$|R

50|$|From {{one year}} to another, {{ecosystems}} experience variation in their biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>environments.</b> A drought, an especially cold winter and a pest outbreak all constitute short-term variability in environmental conditions. Animal populations vary from year to year, building up during resource-rich periods and crashing as they overshoot their food supply. These changes play out in changes in NPP, decomposition rates, and other ecosystem processes. Longer-term changes also shape ecosystem processes—the forests of eastern North America still show legacies of cultivation which ceased 200 years ago, while methane production in eastern Siberian lakes is controlled by organic matter which accumulated during the Pleistocene.|$|R

2500|$|It can be {{understood}} as a situation in which a species' interactions with its biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>environment</b> seem to indicate a history of coevolution, when in actuality the relevant traits evolved in response to a different set of biotic and abiotic conditions. [...] The simplest form of ecological fitting is resource tracking, in which an organism continues to exploit the same resources, but in a new host or environment. In this framework, the organism occupies a multidimensional operative environment defined by the conditions in which it can persist, similar to the idea of the Hutchinsonian niche. [...] In this case, a species can colonize new environments (e.g. an area with the same temperature and water regime) and/or form new species interactions (e.g. a parasite infecting a new host) which can lead to the misinterpretation of the relationship as coevolution, although the organism has not evolved and is continuing to exploit the same resources it always has. The more strict definition of ecological fitting requires that a species encounter an environment or host outside of its original operative environment and obtain realized fitness based on traits developed in previous environments that are now co-opted for a new purpose. [...] This strict form of ecological fitting can also be expressed either as colonization of new habitat or the formation of new species interactions.|$|E

Understanding the complex nature of plant–microbe interactions can potentially offer new strategies to enhance plant productivity in an environmentally friendly manner. As brieﬂy reviewed here,the emerging area of multi-species transcriptomics holds the promise to provide knowledge on how this can be achieved.

The properties used are shared specific enzymatic activity, shared enzymatic function without substrate specificity, shared coenzymes, and shared functional family.

40|$|Plants {{frequently}} suffer {{attack from}} herbivores and microbial pathogens, and have evolved a complex array of defence mechanisms to resist defoliation and disease. These include both preformed defences, ranging from structural features to stores of toxic secondary metabolites, and inducible defences, which are activated only after an attack is detected. It {{is well known}} that plant defences against pests and pathogens are commonly affected by environmental conditions, but the mechanisms by which responses to the biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>environments</b> interact are only poorly understood. In this review, we consider the impact of light on plant defence, in terms of both plant life histories and rapid scale molecular responses to biotic attack. We bring together evidence that illustrates that light not only modulates defence responses via its influence on biochemistry and plant development but, in some cases, is essential for the development of resistance. We suggest that the interaction between the light environment and plant defence is multifaceted, and extends across different temporal and biological scales...|$|R

Throughout we use the central result that the fitness (reproductive) value of information can never be negative to highlight conceptual inconsistencies in the ecological literature on information use. Information processing is central to many biological phenomena. This is often self-evident for processes underlying adaptive behaviour, particularly those involved with adjusting to local ecological conditions (Dall et al. 2005 a). However, for many developmental and physiological processes their roles in processing information are less obvious.

40|$|Adaptation to {{divergent}} environments creates {{and maintains}} biological diversity, {{but we know}} little {{about the importance of}} different agents of ecological divergence. Coevolution in obligate mutualisms has been hypothesized to drive divergence, but this contention has rarely been tested against alternative ecological explanations. Here, we use a well-established example of coevolution in an obligate pollination mutualism, Yucca brevifolia and its two pollinating yucca moths, to test the hypothesis that divergence in this system is the result of mutualists adapting to different <b>abiotic</b> <b>environments</b> as opposed to coevolution between mutualists. • We used a combination of principal component analyses and ecological niche modeling to determine whether varieties of Y. brevifolia associated with different pollinators specialize on different environments. • Yucca brevifolia occupies a diverse range of climates. When the two varieties can disperse to similar environments, they occupy similar habitats. • This suggests that the two varieties have not specialized on distinct habitats. In turn, this suggests that nonclimatic factors, such as the biotic interaction between Y. brevifolia and its pollinators, are responsible for evolutionary divergence in this system.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of organisms is crucially {{dependent on the}} {{evolution of}} intraspecific variation. Its interactions with selective agents in the biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>environments</b> underlie many processes, such as intraspecific competition, resource partitioning and, eventually, species formation. Nevertheless, comparative models of trait evolution neither allow explicit testing of hypotheses related to the evolution of intraspecific variation nor do they simultaneously estimate rates of trait evolution by accounting for both trait mean and variance. Here, we present a model of phenotypic trait evolution using a hierarchical Bayesian approach that simultaneously incorporates interspecific and intraspecific variation. We assume that species-specific trait means evolve under a simple Brownian motion process, whereas species-specific trait variances are modeled with Brownian or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. After evaluating the power of the method through simulations, we examine whether life-history traits impact evolution of intraspecific variation in the Eriogonoideae (buckwheat family, Polygonaceae). Our model is readily extendible to more complex scenarios of the evolution of inter- and intraspecific variation and presents a step toward more comprehensive comparative models for macroevolutionary studies...|$|R
40|$|Subtilases (SBTs) are serine peptidases {{that are}} found in all three domains of life. As {{compared}} with homologs in other Eucarya, plant SBTs are {{more closely related to}} archaeal and bacterial SBTs, with which they share many biochemical and structural features. However, in the course of evolution, functional diversification led to the acquisition of novel, plant-specific functions, resulting in the present-day complexity of the plant SBT family. SBTs are much more numerous in plants than in any other organism, and include enzymes involved in general proteolysis as well as highly specific processing proteases. Most SBTs are targeted to the cell wall, where they contribute to the control of growth and development by regulating the properties of the cell wall and the activity of extracellular signaling molecules. Plant SBTs affect all stages of the life cycle as they contribute to embryogenesis, seed development and germination, cuticle formation and epidermal patterning, vascular development, programmed cell death, organ abscission, senescence, and plant responses to their biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>environments.</b> In this article we provide a comprehensive picture of SBT structure and function in plants...|$|R

Species interact in three ways: competition, predation and mutualism. Competition typically results in a double negative—that is both species lose in the interaction.
