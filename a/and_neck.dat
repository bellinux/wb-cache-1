5|$|The adult plumage is {{a uniform}} black, with the {{exception}} of a frill of white feathers nearly surrounding the base of the neck and, especially in the male, large patches or bands of white on the wings which do not appear until the completion of the bird's first moulting. The head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> are red to blackish-red and have few feathers. The head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> are meticulously kept clean by the bird, and their baldness is an adaptation for hygiene, allowing the skin to be exposed to the sterilizing effects of dehydration and ultraviolet light at high altitudes. The crown of the head is flattened. In the male, the head is crowned with a dark red caruncle or comb, while the skin of his neck lies in folds, forming a wattle. The skin of the head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> is capable of flushing noticeably in response to emotional state, which serves to communicate between individuals. Juveniles have a grayish-brown general coloration, blackish head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> skin, and a brown ruff.|$|E

40|$|The {{shortening}} {{and extension}} of mechanically layered ductile rock generates folds and pinch-and-swell structures (also {{referred to as}} necks or continuous boudins), which result from mechanical instabilities termed folding <b>and</b> <b>necking,</b> respectively. Folding <b>and</b> <b>necking</b> are the preferred deformation modes in layered rock because the corresponding mechanical work involved is less than that associated with a homogeneous deformation. The effective viscosity of a layered rock decreases during folding <b>and</b> <b>necking,</b> even when all material parameters remain constant. This mechanical softening due to viscosity decrease is solely the result of fold and pinch-and-swell structure development and is hence termed structural softening (or geometric weakening). Folding <b>and</b> <b>necking</b> occur over {{the whole range of}} geological scales, from microscopic up to the size of lithospheric plates. Lithospheric folding <b>and</b> <b>necking</b> are evidence for significant deformation of continental plates, which contradicts the rigid-plate paradigm of plate tectonics. We review here some theoretical and experimental results on folding <b>and</b> <b>necking,</b> including the lithospheric scale, together with a short historical overview of research on folding <b>and</b> <b>necking.</b> We focus on theoretical studies and analytical solutions that provide the best insight into the fundamental parameters controlling folding <b>and</b> <b>necking,</b> although they invariably involve simplifications. To first order, the two essential parameters to quantify folding <b>and</b> <b>necking</b> are the dominant wavelength and the corresponding maximal amplification rate. This review also includes a short overview of experimental studies, a discussion of recent developments involving mainly numerical models, a presentation of some practical applications of theoretical results, and a summary of similarities and differences between folding <b>and</b> <b>necking...</b>|$|R

40|$|There is {{a strong}} {{interest}} in accurately modelling the radiative properties of soot aggregates (also known as black carbon particles) emitted from combustion systems and fires to gain improved understanding of the role of black carbon to global warming. This study conducted a systematic investigation of the effects of overlapping <b>and</b> <b>necking</b> between neighbouring primary particles on the radiative properties of soot aggregates using the discrete dipole approximation. The degrees of overlapping <b>and</b> <b>necking</b> are quantified by the overlapping <b>and</b> <b>necking</b> parameters. Realistic soot aggregates were generated numerically by constructing overlapping <b>and</b> <b>necking</b> to fractal aggregates formed by point-touch primary particles simulated using a diffusion-limited cluster aggregation algorithm. Radiative properties (differential scattering, absorption, total scattering, specific extinction, asymmetry factor and single scattering albedo) were calculated using the experimentally measured soot refractive index over the spectral range of 266 - 1064. nm for 9 combinations of the overlapping <b>and</b> <b>necking</b> parameters. Overlapping <b>and</b> <b>necking</b> affect significantly the absorption and scattering properties of soot aggregates, especially in the near UV spectrum due to the enhanced multiple scattering effects within an aggregate. By using correctly modified aggregate properties (fractal dimension, prefactor, primary particle radius, and the number of primary particle) and by accounting for the effects of multiple scattering, the simple Rayleigh-Debye-Gans theory for fractal aggregates can reproduce reasonably accurate radiative properties of realistic soot aggregates.

5|$|In {{order to}} support the robust head, the neck of Hatzegopteryx was likely {{strongly}} muscled. On the occipital bones, the nuchal lines, which serve as muscular attachments, are very well-developed and bear prominent scars. These conceivably supported the transversospinalis muscles, which aid in extension and flexion of the head <b>and</b> <b>neck.</b> Likewise, the opisthotic process, neural spines, and zygapophyses all {{appeared to have been}} large and robust (with the latter bearing many pits and edges that likely represent muscle scars), and the basioccipital tuberosities were long; these all serve as points of attachment for various muscles of the head <b>and</b> <b>neck.</b> Although not entirely unmuscled, the neck of Arambourgiania probably would not have been as extensively muscled as that of Hatzegopteryx.|$|E
5|$|Living in colonies {{results in}} {{a high level of}} social {{interaction}} between birds, which has led to a large repertoire of visual, as well as vocal, displays. These behaviours peak early in the breeding period, and colonies particularly quieten when the male macaroni penguins are at sea. Agonistic displays are those which are intended to confront or drive off or, alternatively, appease and avoid conflict with other individuals. Macaroni penguins, particularly those on adjacent nests, may engage in 'bill-jousting'; birds lock bills and wrestle, each trying to unseat the other, as well as batter with flippers and peck or strike its opponent's nape. Submissive displays include the 'slender walk', where birds move through the colony with feathers flattened, flippers moved {{to the front of the}} body, and head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> hunched, and general hunching of head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> when incubating or standing at the nest.|$|E

5|$|Onions {{suffer from}} a number of plant disorders. The most serious for the home {{gardener}} are likely to be the onion fly, stem and bulb eelworm, white rot, <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> rot.

Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasant-smelling slime. Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants.
