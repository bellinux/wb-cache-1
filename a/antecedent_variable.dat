40|$|ABSTRACT—Mediating {{variables}} {{continue to}} play an im-portant role in psychological theory and research. A me-diating variable transmits the effect of an <b>antecedent</b> <b>variable</b> on to a dependent variable, thereby providing more detailed understanding of relations among variables. Methods to assess mediation have been an active area of research {{for the last two}} decades. This paper describes the current state of methods to investigate mediating variables. KEYWORDS—mediation, indirect effect, statistical methods Mediating variables have been ubiquitous throughout the history of psychology because they are used to explain how or why two variables are related.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that various factors can {{influence}} noncompliance, including task novelty, rate of presentation, and task preference. This study examined the impact of selected <b>antecedent</b> <b>variables</b> on noncompliance in an outpatient clinic setting. In two experiments involving 6 typically developing children, the consequences for noncompliance remained constant. During Experiment 1, demands that included noncontingent access to adult attention were contrasted with the same demands that did not include attention within a multielement design. In Experiment 2, demands were altered by decreasing the difficulty or amount of work or providing access to attention. In both experiments, results indicated idiosyncratic responses to the manipulated variables, with decreases in noncompliance observed following introduction of one or more <b>antecedent</b> <b>variables</b> with 5 of the 6 participants. These results suggested that noncompliance can be reduced via changes in <b>antecedent</b> <b>variables,</b> including adding potential positive reinforcers to the task situation, and {{that it is possible to}} probe variables that alter noncompliance in an outpatient clinic setting...|$|R

Significant cross-national differences were also observed for the levels of PSO and URT. Although budget tightness was significantly related to PSO, this was not the case for URT. This has led to the suggestion that URT may be less dependent on levels of budget tightness and may have become an 'institutionalised' practice within audit firms.

This study aimed to investigate factors that affect QOL in MS. A large national sample of Australians with MS (n = 1848) generated from the Australian Multiple Sclerosis Longitudinal Study completed a survey addressing disease duration and severity, self-efficacy, depression, perceived stress, social support, QOL, and self-management. We tested a model of self-help in which <b>antecedent</b> <b>variables</b> are influenced by mediating variables, which in turn affects outcome variables. In the current study, the <b>antecedent</b> <b>variables</b> were disease duration and disease severity; the mediating variables were self-efficacy, depression, perceived stress, and social support; and the outcome variables were QOL and self-management. We also tested the hypothesis that disease severity, depression, and perceived stress would correlate inversely with QOL and potential for self-management, whereas self-efficacy and perceived level of social support would correlate positively with QOL and potential for self-management. The {{results indicated that the}} <b>antecedent</b> <b>variables</b> did not correlate with the mediating variables, with one exception: a negative correlation was found between disease severity and social support.

We extend social exchange theory to include perceptions of the total job situation and develop a model that positions job satisfaction as a mediator of the relationships between various internal and external <b>antecedent</b> <b>variables,</b> and three volitional workplace behaviours: citizenship behaviours, counterproductive workplace behaviours, and job withdrawal. The fit of a fully mediated model is good and all four classes of antecedents (dispositions, workplace events, job characteristics, job opportunities) contributed uniquely to the prediction of satisfaction. Job satisfaction is also shown to mediate most antecedent-consequence relationships, although two important exceptions are evident. A direct link from pro-social disposition to OCBs, and a direct link and one from anti-social disposition to counterproductivity, suggest that job satisfaction does not fully moderate the relationships between dispositions and contextual behaviours...|$|R

40|$|Unemployment varies {{strongly}} {{between countries}} with comparable economic structure. Some economists {{have tried to}} explain these differences with institutional differences in the labour market. Instead, this paper focuses on a model with multiple equilibria so that the same socioeconomic structure can give rise to different levels of unemployment. Unemployed workers' search efficiency are modelled within an equilibrium search model and lay behind these results. In the model learned helplessness causes a pro-cyclical behavior of the aggregate search efficiency, {{also known as the}} discouraged worker effect. The model can distinguish between locally stable and unstable labour market equilibria. The analysis shows that if a shock in an <b>antecedent</b> <b>variable</b> brings unemployment above the unstable equilibrium, the economy will eventually stabilize in a state with an even higher level of unemployment. However, a shock that brings the variable back at its initial level will not be enough to bring unemployment back at the lower equilibrium. Hence, the model also offers an explanation of why unemployment seems to move more easily up than down.
