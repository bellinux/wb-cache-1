A mechanically aerated stirred system with baffles was used, containing different microbial suspensions in water. Data was collected for suspensions of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the fungus Aspergillus niger, and correlations were drawn between the ratio of effective power applied to aerated systems (Pg) and non-aerated systems (Po) and the dimensionless aeration number (Na).

40|$|A {{study was}} made of the pumping {{capacity}} of pitched blade impellers (two, three, four, five and six blade pitched blade impellers with pitch angles α = 35 ° and 45 °) coaxially located in a cylindrical pilot plant vessel with cylindrical draught tube provided with a standard dished bottom. The draught tube was equipped with four equally spaced radial baffles above the impeller pumping liquid upwards towards the liquid surface. In all investigated cases the liquid aspect ratio H/T = 1. 2 - 1. 5, the draught tube / vessel diameter ratios DT /T = 0. 2 and 0. 4 and the impeller / draught tube diameter ratio D/DT = 0. 875. The pumping capacity of the impeller was calculated from the radial profile of the axial component of the mean velocity in the draught tube below the impeller at such an axial distance from the impeller that the rotor does not affect the vorticity of the flow. The mean velocity was measured using a laser Doppler anemometer with forward scatter mode in a transparent draught tube and a transparent vessel of diameter T = 400 mm. Two series of experiments were performed, both of them under a turbulent regime of flow of the agitated liquid. First, the optimum height of the dished bottom was sought, and then the dependences of the dimensionless flow rate criterion and the impeller power number on the number of impeller blades were determined for both pitch angles tested under conditions of optimum ratio HT /DT. It follows from the results of the experiments that the optimum ratio HT /DT = 0. 25 when the cross sectional areas of the horizontal flow around the bottom and the vertical inflow to the draught tube are the same. For all the tested pitched blade impellers the impeller power number when α = 45 ° exceeds the value of this quantity when pitch angle α  =   35 °, while the flow rate number when α = 35 ° exceeds this quantity when α = 45 °. On the other hand, the absolute values of the impeller power number when the draught tube was introduced correspond fairly well to the dimensionless impeller power input measured in a system without a draught tube. However, the absolute values of the flow rate number found in the former system are significantly lower than the dimensionless impeller pumping capacity determined in the latter system.

40|$|Despite its {{importance}} in chemical industries, {{there are few}} works which studies anchor type impellers and {{only a fraction of}} the works investigate these systems under a computational approach. The great majority refers to turbine impellers, specially Rushton turbines, under turbulent flow. Anchor impellers are used specially for highly viscous flow, typical of polymer reactions. The viscosity is normally in the range 1000 - 10000 cp. Since this range of viscosity describe highly viscous flows, the reactions for anchor <b>agitated</b> <b>systems</b> are normally carried out under laminar flow. This work presents a detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach to study the behaviour of stirred vessels using anchor impellers. The axial plane of the tank, which is being modelled, is divided into small control volumes, which collectively is referred to as the mesh, or grid. In each of these cells the momentum balance, energy and mass conservation, which describes the model, are rewritten algebraically using the finite volumes method to relate such variables as velocity, pressure and temperature to values in neighbouring cells. The equations are then solved numerically, and the results yield the flow corresponding to the model. Since the geometry of a vessel with anchor impellers strictly calls for a three dimensional method, an approximation is made to account for the effect of the blades (Kuncewics, 1992). The main objective of this work is to give a detailed description of the flow generated by this axial impeller with a view to indicate ways in which the design and operation of these systems can be improved...|$|R

Microcarriers enable {{the culture of}} anchorage-dependent cells in stirred-tank bioreactors. However, no robust, transferable methodology for microcarrier selection exists, with studies providing little or no reason explaining why a microcarrier was employed. We systematically evaluated 13 microcarriers for human bone marrow-derived MSC (hBM-MSCs) expansion from three donors to establish a reproducible and transferable methodology for microcarrier selection. Monolayer studies demonstrated input cell line variability with respect to growth kinetics and metabolite flux. HBM-MSC 1 underwent more cumulative population doublings over three passages in comparison to hBM-MSC 2 and hBM-MSC 3. In 100 mL spinner flasks, agitated conditions were significantly better than static conditions, irrespective of donor, and relative microcarrier performance was identical where the same microcarriers outperformed others with respect to growth kinetics and metabolite flux. Relative growth kinetics between donor cells on the microcarriers {{were the same as}} the monolayer study. Plastic microcarriers were selected as the optimal microcarrier for hBM-MSC expansion.

The applicability of a prototyped, small-scale, continuously wave-induced <b>agitated</b> <b>system</b> for intensification of anchorage-dependent CP 5 chondrocytes proliferation outside and inside three-dimensional poly(lactic acid) (PLA) scaffolds has been discussed. Fibrous PLA-based constructs have been inoculated with CP 5 cells and then maintained in two independent incubation systems: (i) non-agitated conditions and (ii) culture with wave-induced agitation. Significantly higher values of the volumetric glucose consumption rate have been noted for the system with the wave-induced agitation.

Results of the proceeded experiments and their analysis clearly exhibited the feasibility of the culture system supported with continuously wave-induced agitation for robust proliferation of the CP 5 chondrocytes on PLA-based structures.

While it is focused on heap bioleaching, it has applications to stirred tank bioleaching operations. Industrial heap bioleaching offers opportunities for processing of low grade ores but poses process operational challenges. These challenges include ineffective heap inoculation, a lag period before effective leaching commences and poor heap performance.

Current literature regarding microbial attachment to sulfide minerals is limited to pure culture studies using iron oxidising mesophiles, and the use of sulfide mineral concentrates. In a heap environment, mineral dissolution is accelerated through the presence of a mixed consortium of microbial species; with the contribution of each not yet fully understood.

Its uniqueness lies {{in its ability to}} operate in two modes: aeration or simply blending (mixing) by just reversing the direction of rotation.

The flow pattern and the velocity field measurements inside the agitated tank were performed by both the Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) and the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) techniques for the single phase (Mixing) mode and for the two phases (Aeration) mode. The oxygen mass transfer occurs both in the water bulk and in the spray above water surface and has been independently investigated. Different configurations and operational conditions were tested during the experimental part in order to interpret phenomenon effect of the draft tube and RTP propeller, rotational speed, turbine blades submergence and else on the flow field and the oxygen mass transfer in the <b>agitated</b> <b>system</b> that produced mainly by a cone shape turbine. The experimental part dealing with hydrodynamics and flow field shows that the down-pumping operation mode with the draft tube has the most convenient results in the mixing mode with respect to turbulent flow field and mixing time. Whilst for the up-pumping aeration mode the hydrodynamics experimental results show the whole system configuration is the most convenient with regarded to mean velocities, turbulent flow intensity and mixing time. For the oxygen mass transfer experimental part, it is found that the highest standard liquid bulk aeration efficiency is achieved (SAEb = 2. 65 kgO 2 kw- 1 h- 1) when the whole system configuration is used.

Preliminary experiments were first carried out in a small scale single stage mixer-settler unit operating with the 20 TBPOK 0. 05 M nitric acid uranyl nitrate system. This work was followed by measurements of drop size distribution in <b>agitated</b> liquid-liquid <b>systems</b> in 6 and 9 inches baffled and a 20 cm side square tank using six-flat bladed turbine type impellers. The drop size measurement technique employed fiber optic probes and photography. The liquid-liquid systems used for the measurements were methyl-iso-butyl ketonewater cyclohexanewater and 20 TBPOK 0. 05 nitric acid. The volumetric fractions were 0. 10 0. 15 and 0. 20 Impeller speeds varied from 300 to 500 r. p. m. A correlation of the mean drop size for the cylindrical and square vessels under both batch and continuous conditions were established...|$|R

40|$|Measurements of {{impeller}} speed, {{power consumption}} and gas holdup were combined with visual {{observations of the}} extent of gas dispersion and particle suspension in three phase systems for a wide size range of fully baffled, agitated vessels (tank diameters from 0. 29 to 1. 83 m). Several common impeller geometries were examined and a minimum mixing condition with regard to gas dispersion was specified for each type. Where the impeller had previously been characterized (e. g. the six-bladed disc turbine) in gas-liquid systems, this minimum condition coincided with those generally accepted in the literature. The minimum mixing condition with regard to particle suspension was taken to be when no particle remained at rest on the base for more than one to two seconds. A system was defined as efficiently mixed when both gas dispersion and particle suspension criteria were. simultaneously satisfied for the minimum power input. The effect of well-suspended particles on the gas-liquid hydrodynamics in the vessel was negligible, but if large quantities of particles were settled out on the vessel base, gas dispersion was affected. On the other hand, aeration had an adverse influence on particle suspension, and increased impeller speeds and powers were necessary to maintain the particles in the just-suspended state if the system was sparged with gas. Consequently the result of aerating a system which was operating at the ungassed just-suspended condition was sedimentation of the solids. The severity of this sedimentation was dependent on impeller geometry, and at one extreme could result in complete sedimentation of all the solids for a very small change in operating conditions. A qualitative method is presented which gives an indication of the likely extent of sedimentation. Of the impellers investigated, the disc turbine and mixed flow impeller pumping upwards are shown to provide the most stable and efficient operation at high gas rates. A tentative procedure for designing a disc turbine <b>agitated</b> <b>system</b> is proposed and is supported by data collected over the whole vessel size range. A novel theoretical approach to estimating gas-liquid mass transfer coefficients is utilised to produce data which support the use of disc turbines and mixed flow impellers pumping upwards as the most efficient impellers in a three phase system...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reports the}} results of some {{laboratory}} investigations concerning the mud-water phosphorus relationship of some Northern Wisconsin and Upper Michigan bog lake muds as influenced by lime, acid, and mechanical agitation. Calcium carbonate added to the water phase of mud-water systems reduced the amount of soluble phosphorus from 8. 0 to 0. 8 parts per billion. The lime formed a thin crust at the mud-water interface, while the original pH of the bottom material prevailed {{at a depth of}} one-fourth inch below the mud surface. Agitation of the mud cores by stirring resulted in complete lime penetration throughout a three-inch core. Experimental apparatus in which it is possible to obtain a 12 °C tempcraturc differential for stratifying water is described. Radioactive ordinary superphosphate fertilizer was placed at various depths below the mud surface, and the percentage as well as the amount of phosphorus released to the water was indicated to bc very small with virtually no phosphorus released from depths greater than one-fourth inch below the mud surface. Agitation by stirring of the muds resulted in approximately twice the concentrations of soluble phosphorus in the water phase of the <b>agitated</b> <b>systems</b> as compared to the undisturbed systems. The most effective means of releasing fcrtilizcr phosphorus placed one-fourth inch below the mud surface was found to be the acidification of previously limed mud-water systems. The mechanism of phosphorus suppression by the addition of calcium compounds to mud water systems is suggested to bc adsorption of phosphate ions onto th. e surface of the cal-cium particles in a similar manner as that described by Boischot et al. Large quantities of phosphorus are con-sistently found deposited in lake muds, but often the quantities of soluble phosphorus found in the waters are very small. If a mechanism could be discovered to increase the release of the phosphorus from the bot-tom muds so that it could contribute to the production of algae, and hcncc fish, it would be a valuable contribution.

40|$|Suspension of solids in {{mechanically}} agitated vessels {{is important}} industrially for many solid-liquid {{processes such as}} dissolution and leaching. This becomes especially important for process intensification in agitated vessels which involves processing high solids concentration slurry {{for the purpose of}} increased throughput per unit volume without major changes in the geometry of the existing infrastructure. To achieve the off-bottom suspension of high concentration slurry, impeller speed and power draw need to be increased substantially but there is no guarantee this will lead to improved solid-liquid mass transfer. Solid-liquid mass transfer in an agitated vessel has been studied extensively during the last few decades but the knowledge is limited to low solids concentration systems. Mass transfer in systems with high solids loading is not fully understood yet. Also, there have been very few attempts to investigate the effects of active particles mass fraction on solid-liquid mass transfer in agitated vessels. This study investigates the effects of solids loading and the concentration of active particles on solid-liquid mass transfer in an <b>agitated</b> dissolution <b>system...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{sorption}} {{of three}} metal ions, namely, copper, nickel and lead onto {{sphagnum peat moss}} has been studied using an <b>agitated</b> batch sorber <b>system.</b> The equilibrium isotherms were determined and kinetic runs were performed over a range of concentrations for each metal ion. A film-pore diffusion mass transfer model has been developed based on a single effective diffusion coefficient for each system. Error analysis of the experimental and theoretical data indicated relatively large errors at low initial metal ion concentrations. Therefore the model was modified to introduce a surface coverage concentration dependent effective diffusivity to account for a contribution from surface diffusion. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|The Vanyukov Process is a {{nonferrous}} bath smelter incorporating side {{injection of}} the blast into a slag-matte emulsion. Used primarily for the smelting of copper and nickel sulphide ores, a claimed advantage over other commercial nonferrous smelters is the phenomena of coalescence of matte droplets in the bath. The subsequent increase {{in the rate of}} phase separation step is thought to lead to an increase in the overall efficiency of the process. The study of coalescence and breakage of dispersed phases in agitated emulsions has concentrated primarily upon mechanically stirred systems, where dispersed and continuous phases are approximately the same density. Gas <b>agitated</b> <b>systems</b> are less well reported and studies into coalescence in the Vanyukov process are the least published. The technique of cold modelling has been utilised by a range of researchers to address fluid flow issues, particularly in the steel industry. The methods are equally applicable to studies into nonferrous systems, and this was the experimental technique used in this study. A 1 / 6 scale model using an aqueous/paraffin oil analogue was adopted to represent a tuyere section from a Vanyukov Reactor. Digital cameras and image analysis was used {{in the study of the}} relationship between gas flow rates and mean droplet diameters. The effect of tuyere diameter on droplet diameters was also assessed. Analysis of droplet dispersions indicated that the use of digital camera technology was acceptable, however the technical specification of the camera had a significant bearing upon results generated. Of the two cameras utilised, both showed the same trend between gas flow rate and mean droplet diameter. However, the camera with improved feamres of high resolution and S-VHS signal processing, produced clearer images allowing more accurate measurement of droplets. In particular, droplets in the range 50 to l(X) |Lim could be measured, improving the accuracy of the results obtained. The results indicate that a relationship between gas flow rate and droplet size exists. It was observed that a maximum droplet size is obtained with a gas flow rate of 961 /min, which equates to 430 Nm^/m^/h in a full scale Vanyukov reactor. For flow rates lower than this value, coalescence is less likely to occur, and for flow rates increasing from 96 to 140 1 /min, a steadily decreasing mean droplet diameter is observed. No relationship was found between tuyere diameter and mean droplet diameter, over the gas flow rates and diameters studied...|$|R
