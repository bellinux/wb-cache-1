40|$|A non-antibiotic based {{selection}} system using l-lysine as selection agent and the lysine racemase (lyr) as selectable marker gene for plant transformation {{was established in}} this study. l-lysine was toxic to plants, and converted by Lyr into d-lysine which would subsequently {{be used by the}} transgenic plants as nitrogen source. Transgenic tobacco and Arabidopsis plants were successfully recovered on l-lysine medium at efficiencies of 23 and 2. 4 %, respectively. Phenotypic characterization of transgenic plants clearly revealed the expression of normal growth and developmental characteristics as that of wild-type plants, suggesting no pleiotropic effects associated with the lyr gene. The specific activity of Lyr in transgenic tobacco plants selected on l-lysine ranged from 0. 77 to 1. 06 mU/mg protein, whereas no activity was virtually detectable in the wild-type plants. In addition, the composition of the free amino acids, except aspartic acid, was not affected by the expression of the lyr gene in the transgenic tobacco plants suggesting very limited interference with endogenous amino acid metabolism. Interestingly, our findings also suggested that the plant <b>aspartate</b> <b>kinases</b> may possess an ability to distinguish the enantiomers of lysine for feedback regulation.

50|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of threonine {{is regulated}} via allosteric regulation of its precursor, homoserine, by structurally altering the enzyme homoserine dehydrogenase. This reaction occurs at a key branch {{point in the}} pathway, with the substrate homoserine serving as the precursor for the biosynthesis of lysine, methionine, threonin and isoleucine. High levels of threonine result in low levels of homoserine synthesis. The synthesis of <b>aspartate</b> <b>kinase</b> (AK), which catalyzes the phosphorylation of aspartate and initiates its conversion into other amino acids, is feed-back inhibited by lysine, isoleucine, and threonine, which prevents the synthesis of the amino acids derived from aspartate.

50|$|Lysine is {{synthesized}} from aspartate via the diaminopimelate (DAP) pathway. The initial {{two stages}} of the DAP pathway are catalyzed by aspartokinase and aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase and {{play a key role}} in the biosynthesis of lysine, threonine and methionine. There are two bifunctional aspartokinase/homoserine dehydrogenases, ThrA and MetL, in addition to a monofunctional aspartokinase, LysC. Transcription of aspartokinase genes is regulated by concentrations of the subsequently produced amino acids, lysine, threonine and methionine. The higher these amino acids concentrations, the less the gene is transcribed. ThrA and LysC are also feed-back inhibited by threonine and lysine. Finally, DAP decarboxylase LysA mediates the last step of the lysine synthesis and is common for all studied bacterial species. The formation of <b>aspartate</b> <b>kinase</b> (AK), which catalyzes the phosphorylation of aspartate and initiates its conversion into other amino acids, is also inhibited by both lysine and threonine, which prevents the formation of the amino acids derived from aspartate. Additionally, high lysine concentrations inhibit the activity of dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHPS). So, in addition to inhibiting the first enzyme of the aspartate families biosynthetic pathway, lysine also inhibits the activity of the first enzyme after the branch point, i.e. the enzyme that is specific for lysine’s own synthesis.|$|E
40|$|International audiencePlant monofunctional <b>{{aspartate}}</b> <b>kinase</b> {{is unique}} among all aspartate kinases, showing synergistic inhibition by lysine and S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM). The Arabidopsis genome contains three genes for monofunctional aspartate kinases. We show that <b>aspartate</b> <b>kinase</b> 2 and <b>aspartate</b> <b>kinase</b> 3 are inhibited only by lysine, and that <b>aspartate</b> <b>kinase</b> 1 is inhibited in a synergistic manner by lysine and SAM. In {{the absence of}} SAM, <b>aspartate</b> <b>kinase</b> 1 displayed low apparent affinity for lysine compared to <b>aspartate</b> <b>kinase</b> 2 and <b>aspartate</b> <b>kinase</b> 3. In the presence of SAM, the apparent affinity of <b>aspartate</b> <b>kinase</b> 1 for lysine increased considerably, with K(0. 5) values for lysine inhibition {{similar to those of}} <b>aspartate</b> <b>kinase</b> 2 and <b>aspartate</b> <b>kinase</b> 3. For all three enzymes, the inhibition resulted from an increase in the apparent K(m) values for the substrates ATP and aspartate. The mechanism of <b>aspartate</b> <b>kinase</b> 1 synergistic inhibition was characterized. Inhibition by lysine alone was fast, whereas synergistic inhibition by lysine plus SAM was very slow. SAM by itself had no effect on the enzyme activity, in accordance with equilibrium binding analyses indicating that SAM binding to <b>aspartate</b> <b>kinase</b> 1 requires prior binding of lysine. The three-dimensional structure of the <b>aspartate</b> <b>kinase</b> 1 -Lys-SAM complex has been solved [Mas-Droux C, Curien G, Robert-Genthon M, Laurencin M, Ferrer JL & Dumas R (2006) Plant Cell 18, 1681 - 1692]. Taken together, the data suggest that, upon binding to the inactive <b>aspartate</b> <b>kinase</b> 1 -Lys complex, SAM promotes a slow conformational transition leading to formation of a stable <b>aspartate</b> <b>kinase</b> 1 -Lys-SAM complex. The increase in <b>aspartate</b> <b>kinase</b> 1 apparent affinity for lysine in the presence of SAM thus results from the displacement of the unfavorable equilibrium between <b>aspartate</b> <b>kinase</b> 1 and <b>aspartate</b> <b>kinase</b> 1 -Lys towards the inactive form...|$|E

We did not find a significant difference in total activity of dihydrodipicolinate synthase, HSDH, and Lys ketoglutarate reductase between these inbreds, and the feedback inhibition properties of HSDH and dihyrodipicolinate synthase by Lys and/or Thr were similar. The most significant difference we found between Oh 545 o 2 and Oh 51 Ao 2 is feedback inhibition of AK by Lys but not Thr. AK activity in Oh 545 o 2 is less sensitive to Lys inhibition than that in Oh 51 Ao 2, with a Lys I 50 twice that of Oh 51 Ao 2.

Spectrophotometric and chemical methods measured parameters specific to myocardial infarction presented a significant accumulation of lipid peroxidase, reduction of glutathione and increased of reduced lactate dehydrogenase levels were observed while the cardiac marker enzymes creatinine <b>kinase,</b> <b>aspartate</b> aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. None of these parameters changed significantly with rosiglitazone treatment (6 and 12 mg kg - 1) when compared to the group that was only treated with isoproterenol. Present results suggest that rosiglitazone does not potentiate the cardiac toxicity of isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats. These findings strengthen the notion that rosiglitazone has a lower risk of myocardial infarction than previously reported...|$|R
40|$|The {{levels of}} {{activity}} of some enzymes involved in oxidative metabolism have been determined in left ventricular tissue from spontaneously hypertensive rats {{compared with those}} in normotensive controls. Levels of pyruvate kinase were increased about 1. 3 fold indicative of elevated glycolytic activity. Similarly, enhanced levels of lactate dehydrogenase were found, consistent with a requirement for increased oxidation of cytosolically-generated NADH. In addition a more active malate-aspartate shuttle, which in heart provides the major route for transfer of reducing equivalents to the mitochondria, was suggested by elevated levels of the cytosolic isoenzyme of aspartate aminotransferase; malate dehydrogenase did not increase but the activity of this enzyme is very high and unlikely to be rate-limiting in the shuttle. The levels of expression of mRNAs for three of these enzymes (pyruvate <b>kinase,</b> <b>aspartate</b> aminotransferase and malate dehydrogenase) were also determined and correlated well with the extent of change, if any, in the changes in enzymatic activity. Thus it seems that one response to development of hypertension in rats {{is an increase in}} expression of the genes for certain key enzymes involved in oxidative metabolism...|$|R
