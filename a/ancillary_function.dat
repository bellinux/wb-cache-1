25|$|In the {{economic}} and technological circumstances of the time such an entrepôt (or to use the Dutch term: stapelmarkt) fulfilled important functions. The word has connotations of a duty-free port, but in an economic sense, a stapelmarkt {{was a place where}} commodities were temporarily physically stocked for future reexport. This was viable because of a legal monopoly for stockpiling a single commodity (wool), granted by a political ruler (like the staple ports designated by the kings of England in medieval times), but also more generally because of technical and economic reasons that still give certain advantages to a spoke-hub distribution paradigm. An important <b>ancillary</b> <b>function</b> of such a physical stock of commodities is that it makes it easier for merchants to even out supply fluctuations, and hence to control price gyrations in thin and volatile markets. Finally, where a physical market forms, market information can more easily be gathered. This was actually the most important economic function of a stapelmarkt in the primitive circumstances of the late 16th century.|$|E

30|$|Generally, {{when the}} {{frequency}} regulation is considered {{as an additional}} function of the energy storage scheme, it would pose additional constraints {{on the design of}} the control strategy. The authors of [10] propose the use of batteries in parked electric vehicles (EV) to contribute to the grid frequency regulation, an <b>ancillary</b> <b>function</b> similar to that offered by the dual-BESS scheme. The grid connection is to charge up the EV batteries within a specified time. As such, the EV should be readily charged within a duration set by the customer, whereas in [3], the committed dispatch power of the dual-BESS shall be guaranteed. Apart from the similarity on the constraints when treating frequency regulation as an <b>ancillary</b> <b>function,</b> the EV scheme takes the form of distributed energy storage control: thus, the optimization of the vehicle owner benefits distinguishes the EV operational strategy from that of the dual-BESS scheme.|$|E

30|$|The {{frequency}} regulation <b>ancillary</b> <b>function</b> of the dual-BESS scheme [3] {{has been}} proposed in this paper. It makes use of the fast-response characteristic of BESS for primary frequency control, to match with the control of conventional generators in which their ramping up/down rates are physically constrained.

30|$|In {{addition}} to the primary message and connect functions described above, some ancillary functions were separately coded that could occur in conjunction with any primary function. For example, a participant may have responded to another’s concern, “Whoa, that is a difficult situation!” followed by an opinion about how to address the concern. The primary connect function of such a message is “provide opinion”; to also capture that emotional support was offered, we separately coded the <b>ancillary</b> <b>function,</b> “community building.” Community building included all messages coded as “celebrate,” “friendship,” “thank,” and “emotional support,” {{as well as other}} types of messages that included such expressions even if not their main function.|$|E

40|$|Belinda Cannone : The {{eclipse of}} baroque {{music in the}} early 19 th Century. This article {{analyses}} the ideas behind writings celebrating the demise of baroque music, {{which began in the}} mid- 1 8 th Century. During the first two decades of the 19 th Century, the term "French music" only applied to music composed before Gluck, who was considered to represent the beginning of a movement to perfect music. Lully and Rameau, who were no longer played, were accused of bad taste and of demoting music and harmony to an <b>ancillary</b> <b>function.</b> The history of music was therefore presented in terms of a break with the early 18 th Century, whose French music is only referred to in terms of errors and depravity.

The procedure uses mid-point estimates of the calibrated ages in combination with the central distributional range as the basis for estimating the fixed relationship between age and depth. Further, it combines the variability of the calibrated age at individual layers (within-object variance) with estimation of the variability of the calibrated age distribution as a whole between the layers standardized by the fixed effect (between-object variance). These components of random variability can be considered independent, and hence the uncertainty of the estimated fixed relationship between age and depth can be estimated by combining the two random variables. The procedure follows the logic of mixed-effects models, but with prior information about the expected variance within each dated object...|$|E

40|$|The {{semi-autonomous}} {{inspection and}} servicing of the Space Station's major thermal, electrical, mechanical subsystems are critical needs for the {{safe and reliable}} operation of the station. A conceptual design is presented of a self-intelligent, small and highly mobile robotic platform. Equipped with suitable inspection sensors (cameras, ammonia detectors, etc.), this system's primary mission is to perform routine, autonomous inspection of the Station's primary subsystems. Typical tasks include detection of leaks from thermal fluid or refueling lines, as well as detection of micro-meteroid damage to the primary structure. Equipped with stereo cameras and a dexterous manipulator, simple teleoperator repairs and small On-orbit Replacement Unit (ORU) changeout can also be accomplished. More difficult robotic repairs would be left to the larger, more sophisticated Mobile Remote Manipulator System (MRMS). An <b>ancillary</b> <b>function</b> is to ferry crew members and equipment around the station.

40|$|Distributed {{generation}} (DG) {{is deeply}} changing the existing distribution networks which become very sophisticated and complex incorporating both active and passive equipment. The simplification of their management {{can be obtained}} assuming a structure with small networks, namely, microgrids, reproducing, in a smaller scale, the structure of large networks including production, transmission, and distribution of the electrical energy. Power converters in distributed generation systems carry on some different ancillary functions as, for example, grid synchronization, islanding detection, fault ride through, and so on. In view of an optimal utilization of the generated electrical power, fault tolerant operation is to {{be considered as a}} suitable <b>ancillary</b> <b>function</b> for the next future. This paper presents a complete modeling of fault tolerant inverters able to simulate the main fault type occurrence and a control algorithm for fault tolerant converters suitable for microgrids. After the model description, formulated in terms of healthy device and leg binary variables, and the illustration of the fault tolerant control strategy, the paper shows how the control preserves power quality when the converter works in the linear range. The effectiveness of the proposed approach and control is shown through computer simulations and experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Fragmentation in {{healthcare}} {{has led to}} a desire to align and integrate care processes horizontally. The concept of value-based healthcare has been introduced, suggesting a maximized value creation to occur when optimal conditions are created for selected patient segments, integrating all activities that jointly determine the success in meeting a set of patient needs. While targeting specialized segments {{has been shown to be}} beneficial, theories of diversification suggests that an increased scope may be an even more efficient approach to improve performance. By sharing resources and capabilities across several specialized units, coordination and knowledge sharing of a hospital’s ancillary services becomes important.   In this study, we examine how an <b>ancillary</b> service <b>function,</b> providing resources and capabilities that are shared across specialized units, can be organized to ensure contribution to the overarching goal of maximizing value for patients. This is done through a qualitative case study of the Karolinska University Laboratory – an <b>ancillary</b> service <b>function</b> of the Karolinska University Hospital. It is concluded that an <b>ancillary</b> service <b>function</b> can, in a diversified context, facilitate and support the value creation around medical conditions by developing a comprehensive structure for knowledge management and sharing, both externally towards medical conditions and internally within the <b>ancillary</b> service <b>function.</b> If structured properly, clear benefits, such as economies of scale, scope and knowledge spillovers, can be achieved by separating sharable resources from the patient flows...|$|R
