25|$|The {{government}} {{continued to}} view rural education as <b>an</b> <b>agenda</b> <b>that</b> could be relatively free from bureaucratic backlog and general stagnation. However, {{in some cases}} lack of financing balanced the gains made by rural education institutes of India. Some ideas failed to find acceptability among India's poor and investments made by the government sometimes yielded little results. Today, government rural schools remain poorly funded and understaffed. Several foundations, such as the Rural Development Foundation (Hyderabad), actively build high-quality rural schools, {{but the number of}} students served is small.|$|E

Chávez also utilized his charisma and flamboyant public speaking stylenoted for its abundance of colloquialisms and ribald manneron the campaign trail to help win the trust and favor of a primarily poor and working class following.|$|E

25|$|The Fascist {{government}} {{endorsed a}} stringent education policy in Italy aiming at eliminating illiteracy, {{which was a}} serious problem in Italy at the time, as well as improving the allegiance of Italians to the state. To reduce drop-outs, the government changed the minimum age of leaving school from twelve to fourteen and strictly enforced attendance. The Fascist government's first minister of education from 1922 to 1924 Giovanni Gentile recommended that education policy should focus on indoctrination of students into Fascism and to educate youth to respect and be obedient to authority. In 1929, education policy took a major step towards being completely {{taken over by the}} agenda of indoctrination. In that year, the Fascist government took control of the authorization of all textbooks, all secondary school teachers were required to take an oath of loyalty to Fascism and children began to be taught that they owed the same loyalty to Fascism as they did to God. In 1933, all university teachers were required to be members of the National Fascist Party. From the 1930s to 1940s, Italy's education focused on the history of Italy displaying Italy as a force of civilization during the Roman era, displaying the rebirth of Italian nationalism and the struggle for Italian independence and unity during the Risorgimento. In the late 1930s, the Fascist government copied Nazi Germany's education system on the issue of physical fitness and began <b>an</b> <b>agenda</b> <b>that</b> demanded that Italians become physically healthy.|$|E

Over 18,000 policemen lost their jobs for irregularities in their hiring, and 25 Indian Police Service officers were suspended for their involvement in corruption while recruiting the constables. Mayawati instituted reforms to introduce transparency into the recruiting process, including posting the results of selection exams online.|$|E

Hanson claimed that responsibility for declining racial relations often rested with Barack Obama, whom Hanson suggested had deliberately inflamed racial tensions between whites and blacks, with a series of gratuitous and racially charged commentaries, dating from the 2008 campaign to editorializing about the Trayvon Martin killing case, as a way of securing the votes of black Americans for the Democrats. Hanson faulted Obama for having [...] "...systematically adopted a rhetoric and <b>an</b> <b>agenda</b> <b>that</b> is predicated on dividing up the country according to tribal grievances, in hopes of recalibrating various factions into a majority grievance culture. In large part, he has succeeded politically. But in doing so he has nearly torn the country apart.

40|$|The {{argument}} {{developed in}} this paper is that a resilient economy requires <b>a</b> growth <b>agenda</b> <b>that</b> is underpinned by a balanced industrial mix, the development and adoption of new knowledge or technological platforms, and risk taking in radical and incremental innovations {{as well as in}} soft and hard innovations. In other words, it is desirable to promote a sustainable and endogenous way to ‘reset’ the economy – borrowing the phrase from this study by Florida – by endorsing <b>a</b> growth <b>agenda</b> <b>that</b> includes also creative and cultural industries. It will further be argued <b>that</b> <b>a</b> policy <b>agenda</b> for the EU's economic growth takes little account of the opportunities and potential of creative and cultural industries, favouring hard technologies and services. A growing literature is starting to highlight the innovation capacity of cultural and creative industries as they intersect the innovation processes of other manufacturing and services sectors with innovative and creative outputs. The indecision of EU policy-makers on how to take advantage of creative and cultural industries for the delivery of a Smart Europe – as part of the Europe 2020 agenda – translates into a lack of commitment to such industries and indeed to <b>a</b> clear cohesion <b>agenda.</b> We make <b>a</b> strong case for EU policy-making to break the deadlock and clearly spell out <b>a</b> policy <b>agenda</b> <b>that</b> has <b>an</b> effective spatial dimension and that directly interfaces with its innovation policy...|$|R
