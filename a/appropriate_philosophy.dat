40|$|Military {{doctrine}} {{is one of}} the conceptual components of war. Its raison d’être is that of a force multiplier. It enables a smaller force to take on and defeat a larger force in battle. This article’s departure point is the aphorism of Sir Julian Corbett, who described doctrine as ‘the soul of warfare’. The second dimension to creating a force multiplier effect is forging doctrine with an <b>appropriate</b> command <b>philosophy.</b> The challenge for commanders is how, in unique circumstances, to formulate, disseminate and apply an appropriate doctrine and combine it with a relevant command philosophy. This can only be achieved by policy-makers and senior commanders successfully answering the Clausewitzian question: what kind of conflict are they involved in? Once an answer has been provided, a synthesis of these two factors can be developed and applied. Doctrine has implications for all three levels of war. Tactically, doctrine does two things: first, it helps to create a tempo of operations; second, it develops a transitory quality that will produce operational effect, and ultimately facilitate the pursuit of strategic objectives. Its function is to provide both training and instruction. At the operational level instruction and understanding are critical functions. Third, at the strategic level it provides understanding and direction. Using John Gooch’s six components of doctrine, it will be argued that there is a lacunae in the theory of doctrine as these components can manifest themselves in very different ways at the three levels of war. They can in turn affect the transitory quality of tactical operations. Doctrine is pivotal to success in war. Without doctrine and the <b>appropriate</b> command <b>philosophy</b> military operations cannot be successfully concluded against an active and determined foe. ...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{companies}} are continuously seeking {{to create and}} sustain competitive advantages to improve their performance and strength their market position. Lean philosophy has allowed organisations to confront the current and future challenges to many industries. Lean focuses on identifying and eliminating waste throughout a product or service value stream, extending not only within the organisation but also along the company’s supply chain network. The competitiveness in the UK biomass energy market has increased the pressure on players to improve their performance by developing successful projects faster. Based on the above statement, this study will adopt Lean Philosophy to analyse the management of biomass power projects in the UK with the following purposes: 1. To map the current origination and development phases of biomass projects and identify the key deliverables; 2. To identify current wastes in a biomass project and propose actions to mitigate them; 3. To evaluate the current origination and development processes and identify possible redesign and critically evaluate the benefits that the company can expect from it. The conclusion of this research indicates that Lean is an <b>appropriate</b> <b>philosophy</b> to analyse the management of biomass power plant projects. The analysis of the project suggests that the elimination of wastes leads to process improvements, thus reducing the project lead time...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to set down the rationale for a separate Science & Technology (S&T) Program within every national deep-geological-isolation program.

Such a Program, separately funded and with a dedicated staff (separate from the ''mainline'' activities to develop the repository, the surface facilities, and the transportation system), can devote itself exclusively to the development and management of a long-term science and technology program.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, the UK {{government}} has sought to assist more effectively small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) -sector firms {{through the creation of}} Training and Enterprise Councils and Business Links. These organisations undertake assessment of client satisfaction. Most of their measurement tools, however, do not permit determination of the factors which are key influencers of client attitudes. Research on customer behaviour both in industrial markets and in service environments has caused some academics to posit that, in many situations, the application of traditional transactional-market-research tools is often ineffective. Accordingly, they propose that satisfaction measurement should encompass the influence of a relationship-management orientation because the processes designed to build long-term customer loyalty may be a more <b>appropriate</b> <b>philosophy</b> through which to gain understanding of SME-sector attitudes to services delivered by suppliers. The aim, therefore, is to examine the relevance of applying a relationship-management research tool to assess client satisfaction in small-business-advisory scenarios. Interviews with advisors and owner/managers have been used to construct a qualitative model of factors influencing the client - advisor relationship. The implications of the study are discussed in relation to the future operation of not-for-profit support agencies seeking to optimise the effectiveness of service provision.

40|$|AbstractThe author {{analyzes}} {{the correlation between}} the development of society and philosophy of education. The goal {{of this article is to}} demonstrate that social development is more clearly shaped when the process of education is given an <b>appropriate</b> <b>philosophy,</b> which means the presence of a sense-making and goal-setting strategy (paradigm, “religion”) of the evolution of society. The example of a number of the world's leading countries confirms the value of such correlation. Even when in a crisis, these countries adapt to the modern world's dynamics (globalization, informatization, etc.) with higher speed if they possess an adequate education philosophy. These leading countries’ philosophy of education is underlain by the thesis: the quality of education defines the quality of life. This outcome can be achieved by drawing on such values as freedom, creativity, partnership, and trust. World university rankings show that the most successful universities aim at achieving this outcome and rely on these basic values regardless of all the modern transformations. The author comes to the conclusion that Russia, represented by its leaders and its government, should, given its desire to join the ranks of the world's leading countries, should instate substantial indicators of quality of life for its citizens, as well as strive to generate an education philosophy of similar nature and actively introduce it in the process of education in the first place...|$|E
40|$|The area of 14 - 19 {{education}} and training was a significant priority for the Labour Government of Tony Blair and New Labour. Reforms such as the 14 - 19 White Paper (Feb 2005) were seen as key to this government’s ‘third term’ agenda. This research has at its heart the desire to identify the true drivers for 14 - 19 {{education and}} training reform, and critically analyse the results against alternative ‘aims’ of education. Much of current policy for this phase of education mentions the economic imperative of providing young people with the skills which both they and businesses need {{to compete in the}} global economy. This research intends to question the fact that economic goals appear to be inexorably entwined with this area of education, and analyse if this is an <b>appropriate</b> <b>philosophy</b> on which to base reform of the 14 - 19 phase. To achieve this, document analysis was used to identify the drivers for education reform contained within five policy documents in an attempt to understand the goals of New Labour’s 14 - 19 {{education and training}} reform policy between May 1997 and February 2005. The conclusions which came from this analysis point to a consistency in the 14 - 19 reform programme of New Labour around the theme of the economy, with much of the content of the reforms focusing on adapting the phase in order to promote economic objectives. It is argued that by accepting economic objectives as a basis for educational reform, New Labour confused the influence of the economy for an educational aim...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a growing {{interest}} in the use of partnering in construction. Central to any successful partnering arrangement is the change in cultural and behavioural characteristics towards mutual trust and understanding. According to Schein, cultural and behavioural characteristics can be shaped and reflected by proper leadership.

This involves understanding, interpreting, explaining and mapping complex human behaviour. Therefore {{it is very important to}} comprehend and implement a suitable research methodology to carefully extract appropriate information. This paper justifies the social constructionism stance and case study approach for the leadership study as the response to address complex relationships challenges of behaviour and culture in construction partnering projects. For this purpose, the nested approach is used, highlighting the main facets of the arguments to justify the selection of <b>appropriate</b> research <b>philosophy</b> and research approach...|$|R

40|$|Time, {{cost and}} quality are the prime {{objectives}} of any project. Unfortunately, today’s project management {{does not always}} ensure the realisation of these objectives.

The present study establishes a methodology for achieving success in implementing projects using a business process re-engineering (BPR) framework.

Process re-engineering emerges as a most critical area for immediate attention.

40|$|Within {{the last}} decade, {{continuous}} quality improvement (CQI) has been embraced by higher education management. An {{important component of}} the quality philosophy is to institute training for everyone: faculty, administrators, staff and students—in order to achieve a cultural transformation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify and describe the implementation characteristics of CQI training programs and to determine whether or not and to what degree relationships exist between these characteristics and training program effectiveness, as perceived by selected individuals at two- and four-year colleges in the United States. A survey instrument was designed to elicit the perceptions of both the chief administrators and those quality professionals who are charged with the training process as they relate to specific implementation characteristics such as training content needed to convey the <b>appropriate</b> <b>philosophy,</b> program implementation processes, and the perceived effectiveness of the respondents' quality training program. A 21 -item questionnaire was used to gather the data from a sample of 524 individuals at two- and four-year colleges in the United States. The dependent variables in the study related to items addressing program effectiveness based on four types of program evaluation, and the independent variables related to specific implementation characteristics. Spearman correlation matrices were executed to test the relationships between and among implementation characteristics and between the four levels of evaluation. Multiple regression analyses were computed to determine which and to what extent implementation characteristics accounted for variation in each of the four measures of effectiveness. Analyses revealed that using a variety of philosophies, tools and content segments, providing training in quality awareness, team leadership, management and leadership, and assessment, using internal trainers, and the extent of staff and faculty support accounted for the largest proportions of variance.

40|$|This thesis takes {{seriously the}} {{proposition}} that existentialism is a lived philosophy. While Descartes' proof {{for the existence of}} God initially sparked my interest in philosophy, the insights of existentialism have allowed me to <b>appropriate</b> <b>philosophy</b> as a way of life. I apply the insights of Kierkegaard's writings to my spiritual and philosophy development. Philosophy is personal, and Kierkegaard's writings deal with the development of the person in his aesthetic, ethical and religious dimensions. Philosophy is a struggle, and this thesis, reveals the existential struggle of the individual in despair. The thesis argues that authentic faith actually entails faith. The existential believer has this faith whereas the religious believer does not. The subjectively reflective existential believer recognizes that a leap of faith is needed; anything else, is just historical, speculative knowledge. The existential believer or, the Knight of Faith, realizes that a leap of faith is needed to become open in inwardness to receive the condition to understand the paradoxes that faith presents. I will present Kierkegaard's "Analogy of a House" which is in essence, the backbone of his philosophy. I will discuss the challenge of moving from one floor to the next. More specifically, I will discuss the anxiety that is felt in the very moment of the transition from the first floor to the second floor. I will outline eight paradoxes that must me resolved in order for the individual to continue on his journey to {{the top floor of the}} house. I will argue that Kierkegaard's example of Abraham as a Knight of Faith is incorrect, that Abraham was in fact not a Knight of Faith. I will also argue that we should find our own exemplars in our own lives by looking for Knight of Faith traits in people we know and then trying to emulate those people. I will also discuss Unamuno's "paradoxical faith" and argue that this kind of faith is a strong alternative to those who find that Kierkegaard's existential faith is not a possibility...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} five months anthropological {{fieldwork}} conducted in Frobisher Bay, Baffin Island, from August {{till the end}} of September, 1971. It is divided into two parts. The first four chapters are mainly descriptive {{with the exception of the}} theoretical orientation presented in Chapter I. The remaining chapters are analytical. [...] Chronologically, the researcher's first impressions of Frobisher Bay, the field strategy and the theoretical perspective for the analysis of the data is presented in Chapter I. The professional, transient Euro-Canadians, and in particular the elementary school teachers, are the focus of the researcher's attention. Their view of their social reality, the ways in which they define their social and educational situation, and the manner in which they perceive the Eskimo community are presented as a case study of the broader phenomenon of civil servants in the Canadian Arctic. The data are presented within the framework of symbolic interactionist theory as developed by George Herbert Mead and other sociologists. Blumer's (1969) statement of the present position of this orientation on the study of human society and human conduct is outlined. [...] In Chapters II and III the growth and development of Frobisher Bay from a small, American airbase in 1942 to the present major civilian, administrative center in the Eastern Arctic is described, as well as the history and present make-up of the Eskimo and Euro-Canadian population. This is set within the context of the historical process of culture-contact in the Baffin region from the time of the discovery of Frobisher Bay by Sir Martin Frobisher in 1576, The whaling and fur industries, the activities of the Church of England missionaries and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police are described. Life styles of the present Frobisher Bay population of approximately twenty-three hundred people are compared. Data are given regarding the socio-cultural background, employment, housing, recreation, and social interaction of the two sectors of the population. [...] In Chapter IV a short historical account of formal education in the Canadian Arctic and in Frobisher Bay specifically is presented. I outline the present educational structure and facilities and some of the findings of recent anthropological research on cross-cultural education. Focussing on the Baffin region and Frobisher Bay respectively, the Northwest Territories' Department of Education policies and programs are investigated. Data on the 1970 / 71 school year are given in Tables 4 to 18. They contain information on the staff and pupils of the elementary schools: national background, age, sex and marital status, training and teaching experience of the teachers; pupil enrollment in Frobisher Bay from 1955 to 1971, grade and age distribution during the 1970 / 71 school year, as well as school attendance figures. This material is analyzed in comparison with Hobart's (1970) data on elementary education in ten Western Arctic communities. [...] Chapter V consists of a presentation of definitions of social situations, often perceived as "problems" by Euro-Canadian residents in Frobisher Bay. It appears that many of them are situational in nature, derived from or arising out of the ambiguous situation which the Canadian North presents to many of its Euro-Canadian residents, especially transient professionals. Much of this information is transmitted through gossip. Although some of this may seem trivial and superficial at first glance, my argument is that much of the gossip is an expression of peoples' feelings about living in the North. Many feel that they have to justify their reasons for being in Frobisher Bay and the role they are playing. They also frequently evaluate and conjecture about other peoples' reasons. These reasons are described in three main categories: financial, professional, and personal reasons. [...] In this section of the thesis Euro-Canadians' perceptions of "Eskimo problems" are also discussed. These are often related to values and opinions regarding benefits or detrimental effects of the welfare system, including its influences on the Eskimo sense of identity, self-esteem, and responsibility. Such perceptions divide the Euro-Canadians into assimilationists and integrationists, with blatant racism and radical reformism at the extremes of the continuum. Distinctions are made between old-timers and newcomers. Local perceptions of "escapists" and "drifters," "idealists" or "Peace Corps types" are discussed. As an example of professional attitudes and affiliation with different service agencies, the minutes of the Coordinating Committee on Social Problems are considered. [...] Chapter VI contains definitions of educational situations, also often perceived as "problems" by the teachers of the Sir Martin Frobisher elementary school. The heterogeneity of this group in terms of background, training, and experience in the North and elsewhere leads to conflicting opinions regarding definitions of the Frobisher Bay school situation. The physical spread of the school, the relative social isolation of some of the teachers, and the various types of classes taught by them (integrated, segregated, and token-integrated) adds to the overt and covert disagreement among the teachers about the <b>appropriate</b> <b>philosophy</b> and goals of education in the North and the desired daily classroom practices. Two professional occasions, the Teachers Orientation sessions, and the Curriculum Workshop brought out many of the teachers' feelings, particularly in relation to the New Northern Curriculum, which is being introduced by Yellowknife's Department of Education. [...] There seemed to be consensus, however, among many of the teachers with regard to their general definition of the situation: a lack of relevant, useful information to help solve educational problems in the classroom. Many teachers relate this lack of information to a failure in communication: 1) little or no communication with and guidance from the regional education office; 2) a lack of informal help and interest from the Principal; 3) a lack of sharing of ideas among the teachers themselves; and 4) a complete lack of information regarding the community, especially the Eskimo residents. Since the teachers perceived official channels of communication on the local level as insufficiently open, and information received on the two professional occasions as ambiguous and contradictory to the social reality of Frobisher Bay as they perceived it, they were forced to rely on informal channels of communication: gossip with other Euro-Canadians in the settlement. I present the argument that most Euro-Canadians have only limited and professionally specialized knowledge of the Eskimo community and that therefore much of the information received by the teachers may well give them a distorted view of that community. [...] In Chapter VII I analyze the material of the two preceding chapters in relation to the theoretical perspective on gossip provided by Allport and Postman (1947), Paine (1967) and Shibutani (1966; 1967). Giving specific examples, I present the thesis that gossip in Frobisher Bay is inherently different from that treated in most traditional anthropological literature. I note that Frobisher Bay gossip is a mechanism of informal communication used by small, local groups in crisis situations in an attempt to reduce perceived ambiguity. The situational necessity for gossip and its nature and function, arise out of the fluid character of the settlement's social structure. In such situations previously accepted norms of behavior become inadequate. Emergency action of some kind is required. Furthermore, the felt ambiguity in connection with the perceived lack of information requires special social mechanisms to provide incoming employees with the necessary information for the adequate fulfillment of their jobs and the arrangement of their social lives. At the same time, old-timers assert and protect their vested interests in occupational and social spheres. Gossip is one way of handling this type of situation. [...] In Chapter VIII I attempt to pull together some of the main threads which run through the preceding discussion. The various observations and concepts presented are put in the context of the colonial situation existing in the Canadian North, which, as defined by Memmi (1967), is the most ambiguous situation possible for those confronted with its inherent contradictions. Local perceptions of insufficient and/or ambiguous information, isolation, stagnation, mediocrity and high turnover of personnel are treated with reference to this colonial situation. Memmi's distinction between colonials, colonizers, and colonialists draws attention to the ambiguity of the colonial situation and the kind of moral choices Euro-Canadians are forced to make when in the North. It is my view that many civil servants in the North, including teachers, because of their structural affiliation with the dominant social system, are unable to live in the North as colonials. Their ethical convictions as educated, middle-class professionals prevent them, on the whole, from becoming colonialists. As colonizers, then, they are required to cope with the frustrating, ambiguous situation as "reluctant imperialists" employed by institutions whose goals and practices often conflict and which they cannot fully support and condone...|$|E

An inclusive disjunction is, when explained, more appropriate. Functionalism is <b>appropriate.</b> Thomas Nagel’s <b>philosophy</b> on first person ontology can still be maintained. Quantum and complexity theories’ hypothesis on consciousness is more compatible with freedom of decision than classical theories. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Is it <b>appropriate</b> for <b>philosophy</b> {{to borrow}} from science {{theoretical}} concepts or to invoke experimental evidence {{in order to do}} its explanatory work? One central argument for a positive answer is that rational explanation in general has a holistic character. Such holism applies both to the inferential procedures taken to be valid and to the beliefs taken to be true. Discussions of the notion of reflective equilibrium have developed during the last decades these two central themes. 1) The principle of reflective equilibrium as described by Nelson Goodman (Goodman, 1965) shows that the process through which our forms of inference are justified is virtuously circular: particular deductive inferences are justified by valid general rules that are themselves justified {{by the fact that they}} allow valid inferences. 2) What holds for inference can be generalized to the whole explanatory process. John Rawls (1974) offered a wider picture of reflective equilibrium, including not only the inferential part of the justificatory process, but the substantial part as well: our inferences constrain and are constrained by all the semantic, epistemological, metaphysical and psychological knowledge available. What holds for justification in general seems to hold a fortiori fo...|$|R
30|$|Before {{beginning}} {{the analysis of}} the novel, let me briefly summarize the theory of guṇas and how Ghosh applies it to suit his purpose in his novel. Since Ghosh has a close relationship with his birthplace – Bengal – and is influenced by the Vaiṣṇava schools of the Vedanta tradition, which are prominent in this region, the perspective of guṇas that will be focused on here is that discussed in the Bhagavad-gītā. In fact, throughout the novel, there are other references to Kṛṣṇa, which reinforce the writer’s relationship with the Vaiṣṇava thought. However, {{it is important not to}} forget that as a postcolonial writer, Ghosh has a specific agenda and, in order to critically deal with themes such as colonialism, Western reason, and science, he also critically <b>appropriates</b> Hindu <b>philosophy.</b> By appropriation, I mean selection and transformation of the theory of guṇas. In the same way that Ghosh weaves Indian popular and classical cultures with Western elements in The Circle of Reason, he exercises liberty in the application of the theory of guṇas. Therefore, the following overview of the guṇas reflects more a way to understand how the three guṇas were appropriated by Ghosh than a strict reading of a single philosophical school.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors examine the new public {{management}} (NPM) philosophy influencing the organisational {{environment in which}} child protection social workers are located. NPM prioritises outputs through policies, such as results based accountability (RBA) predicated on the expectation that responsibility to achieve designated programme outcomes is sheeted to the agency and its workers. Ongoing funding depends on programme results. NPM ideology assumes that workers and managers in agencies tasked with delivering care and protection services are {{able to control the}} variables influencing outputs which contribute to outcomes. The authors will analyse four key aspects of NPM thinking (RBA, outputs, outcomes and key performance indicators) and explore their organisational consequences. The influence on social work practice of information and communications technology (ICT), on which NPM depends, is also considered. The paper is not an ideologically based rejection of NPM, but rather an assessment of its consequences for care and protection practice. The authors call for a return to the centrality of relationally based social work processes embodied in common factors (CF) practice, such as the therapeutic alliance. We argue that CF approaches offer a contrasting and more <b>appropriate</b> practice <b>philosophy</b> than NPM thinking while still enabling achievable, multifaceted organisational benefits...|$|R

By applying <b>appropriate</b> business <b>philosophy</b> (in line with the shape and the specific characteristics of sport organizations) the management seeks to achieve its objectives, particularly sportingones, which are the basis for all other (business) goals of the organization. Kaizen, as a modern business philosophy, was said by its founder (Masaki Imai) to be a continuous work on {{how to be a}} better man. Simply saying 'better' is not a precise definition. Kaizen is primarily a daily and continuous improvement. When it comes to sports organizations, one can also talk about the realistic possibilities for the application of kaizen philosophy in their business processes and activities. Seeing as in business organizations the kaizen system requires involvement of all employees (of course, respecting the specific position, role and responsibilities of individuals in the organizational set up) it is quite logical that the sports organization and this approach may be completely acceptable. Essentially the paper, deals with the explication of the determinants of Kaizen as a business philosophy and its possible applicability to sports organizations; as well as a possible model for creating organizational change in them...|$|R
