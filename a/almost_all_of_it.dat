5|$|Although {{the seeds}} of both {{proactive}} government repression against the Puerto Rican independence movement had been planted before the Grito de Lares, and its aftermath only guaranteed the surge of autonomism as a political alternative in the island, the level of cultural and social development of a collective Puerto Rican conscience was almost {{a direct consequence of}} the event. To put it simply, if there is any nationalistic sentiment in Puerto Rico in the present day, <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> {{can be traced back to}} Betances and his political work.|$|E
5|$|In 1276, {{following}} their great {{victory over the}} Lombard triarchs of Negroponte at the Battle of Demetrias, the Byzantines renewed their offensive in Euboea. Licario attacked his native Karystos, seat of the southern triarchy, and took it, after a long siege, in the same year. For this success, he was rewarded by Michael VIII with the whole island as a fief, and a noble Greek wife with a rich dowry. In turn, Licario pledged to provide 200 knights to the Emperor. Gradually, Licario reduced the Latin strongholds on the island, until, by 1278, he had seized <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> except for the capital, the city of Negroponte (Chalkis).|$|E

5|$|Kennedy's role as {{a liberal}} lion in the Senate {{came to the fore}} in 1995, when the Republican Revolution took control and {{legislation}} intending to fulfill the Contract with America was coming from Newt Gingrich's House of Representatives. Many Democrats in the Senate and the country overall felt depressed but Kennedy rallied forces to combat the Republicans. By the beginning of 1996, the Republicans had overreached; most of the Contract had failed to pass the Senate and the Democrats could once again move forward with legislation, <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> coming out of Kennedy's staff.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of his {{business}} career, Romney and his wife had a net worth of between $190 and $250million, including their retirement account, worth between $20 and $100million. Most of that wealth has been held in blind trusts since 2003, some of it offshore. An additional blind trust, valued at $100million in 2012, exists in the name of their children. In 2010, Romney and his wife received about $22million in income, <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> from investments such as dividends, capital gains, and carried interest; and they paid about $3million in federal income taxes, for an effective tax rate of 14percent. For the years 1990–2010, their effective federal tax rates were above 13percent with an average rate of about 20percent.|$|E
5|$|Parliamentary {{enclosures}} {{accounted for}} about 4.5 million acres {{of what had been}} open fields, not counting the enclosure of common land and wild 'waste'. In 1700 roughly half England's arable land was already enclosed; {{by the end of the}} enclosure process, <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was. The revolution in the landscape began in about 1750, affecting about 3,000 parishes, especially in the English midlands. Between 1760 and 1800 there were 1,479 enclosure acts, covering 2.5 million acres; another 1.5 million acres were enclosed by 1844, by more than a thousand further acts. Some counties such as Kent, Essex and Devon were little affected, having largely been enclosed much earlier, often directly from forest or moorland. Many miles of new straight hedgerows were laid to mark out the newly enclosed fields of the midlands; in some areas such as Derbyshire, straight limestone walls were used instead. Many straight new roads were created at the same time. Farmhouses remained in the old villages at first, but new red-brick Victorian ones were often built in the middle of their now enclosed land in due course.|$|E

25|$|Although {{there is}} more {{evidence}} {{in the form of}} texts and wall reliefs for this battle than for any other battle in the Ancient Near East, <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is from an Egyptian perspective. Indeed, the first scholarly report on the battle, by James Henry Breasted in 1903, praised the sources that allowed the reconstruction of the battle with certainty. However, some historians argue that the battle was a draw at best and that Egyptian influence over Amurru and Qadesh seems to have been lost forever.|$|E
25|$|The {{residents}} of Port Royal generally resented {{the military and}} civilian occupiers, who exhibited racist superiority in varying degrees of overtness. Joy—when on April 13, 1862, General David Hunter proclaimed slavery abolished in Georgia, South Carolina, and Alabama—turned to sorrow when on May 12 Union soldiers arrived to draft all able-bodied black men thus liberated. Hunter kept his regiment even after Lincoln reversed this tri-state emancipation proclamation; but disbanded <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> when unable to draw payroll from the War Department. Black farmers preferred to grow vegetables and catch fish, whereas the missionaries (and other whites on the islands) encouraged monoculture of cotton as a cash crop. In the thinking of the latter, civilization would be advanced by incorporating blacks into the consumer economy dominated by Northern manufacturing.|$|E

About 120 people from Jalsindhi and surrounding villages came to the screening, and for <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> them <b>it</b> was the first time they had seen a moving image.|$|R
25|$|Considerable {{work has}} been {{published}} {{on the evolution of}} ant dulosis and <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> has at least some empirical evidence to defend its positions. Notably, that nearly all raiding ant species have is an adaptation of their mandibles that make them big or piercing or both. It makes sense that the very thing that enables an ant to be a better raider causes that same ant to become dependent on others; the parasite loses the use of its mandibles for actual work. On this and other evidence, it has been proposed that predation is the precursor to slavery. It has also been suggested that colony multiplication by adoption and budding followed by temporary parasitism can lead to dulosis. While observations indicate that colony multiplication can lead to temporary parasitism, it is apparently very questionable that temporary parasitism leads to dulosis.|$|E
500|$|PopMatters {{named it}} the best album of 2010 in its year-end list. MTV and Entertainment Weekly placed it at number eight on their lists of the 20 Best Albums of 2010. The Guardian ranked the album number one on its list of 2010's top 40 albums, stating in {{conclusion}} [...] "No other album this year seems so alive with possibility. Monáe is young and fearless enough to try anything, gifted enough to pull <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> off, and large-hearted {{enough to make it}} feel like a communal experience: Us rather than Me". The ArchAndroid was voted the fourth-best album in The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 2010. Five songs from the album were included in the poll's singles list, including [...] "Tightrope" [...] (number two), [...] "Cold War" [...] (number 22), [...] "Wondaland", [...] "Locked Inside", and [...] "Sir Greendown" [...] (all tied for number 549).|$|E
500|$|In 1643 {{a general}} {{obligation}} was imposed on Oxford colleges {{to support the}} Royalist cause in the English Civil War. The King called for Oriel's plate, and <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was given, the total weighing [...] of gilt, and [...] of [...] "white" [...] plate. In the same year the College was assessed at £1 of the weekly sum of £40 charged on the colleges and halls for the fortification of the city. When the Oxford Parliament was assembled during the Civil War in 1644, Oriel housed the Executive Committee of the Privy Council, Parliament being held at neighbouring Christ Church. Following {{the defeat of the}} Royalist cause, the University was scrutinised by the Parliamentarians, and five of the eighteen Oriel Fellows were removed. The Visitors, on their own authority, elected Fellows between 1648 and October 1652, when without reference to the Commissioners, John Washbourne was chosen; the autonomy of the College in this respect seems to have been restored.|$|E

500|$|The {{hurricane}} hit {{land near}} Majahual on the Quintana Roo {{coast of the}} Yucatán Peninsula at 0830UTC on August21. Wind gusts of 200mph (320km/h) were reported. The state's tourist cities of Cancún and Cozumel were spared {{the worst of the}} storm, but it wreaked havoc in the state capital Chetumal, some 40mi (65km) south of landfall, causing significant flooding. Communication with the Mayan communities near the landfall location was initially difficult, but the town of Majahual, which had a population of 200, was [...] "almost flattened" [...] by the storm. Storm surge and high winds severely damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings and had the strength to crumple steel girders. About 15,000families were left homeless, primarily in small villages around Quintana Roo. At the Costa Maya cruise port, waves tore away portions of the concrete docks and destroyed the boardwalk. The damage made the port unsuitable for cruise ships, effectively freezing the region's tourism industry until they could be repaired. The hurricane's winds damaged 2.3million ha (5.7 million acres) of jungle, <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> in Quintana Roo, Yucatán, and Campeche.|$|E
500|$|In {{the post-war}} period Scotland {{continued}} to produce important architects, including James Stirling (1926–92), who with James Gowan (1923–) designed the Flats at Ham Common, London (1955–58), considered a landmark {{in the development}} of modernist, brutalist residential planning, which would have a profound impact in Scotland. Their later work, <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> outside Scotland, would be highly influential on an international scale. The post-war desire for urban regeneration would focus on the tower block, championed in Glasgow by David Gibson, convener of the city housing committee. Projects like the brutalist Red Road Flats originally offered hope of a new beginning and an escape from the overcrowded nineteenth-century tenements of the city, but lacked a sufficient infrastructure and soon deteriorated. Robert Matthew (1906–75) and Basil Spence (1907–76) were responsible for redeveloping the Gorbals in Glasgow, for demolitions at the University of Edinburgh and the stark rebuilding typified by the David Hume Tower (1960–63). Another solution adopted in Scotland was the building of new towns like Glenrothes (1948) and Cumbernauld (1956), designed to take excess population from the cities. Cumbernauld was praised for its architecture when first built, but the uncompleted centre and the layout of the town in general, were receiving heavy criticism by the twenty-first century: its modernist architecture described by one resident as [...] "the lego fantasy of an unhappy child".|$|E
500|$|The FIA {{planned to}} [...] "put <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> into a {{charitable}} foundation which will {{then have the}} resources to undertake important work on improving safety in motor sport and in road safety", and thus the FIA Foundation was created in 2001. In addition, the FIA continued to receive an annual dividend from the deal, Mosley stated: [...] "Over the totality of the contract, and on an annual basis, the sum we have accepted represents billions of dollars. Looked at from that point of view, it is a huge amount of money." [...] Lovell compares the figure to extend the rights to 100 years to the £600million KirchGruppe paid for the rights to the 2002 Football World Cup and the £1.1billion British Sky Broadcasting paid for a three-year package of English Premier League football. The figure was not entirely comparable however due to the dispute over who actually owned Formula One. Before the settlement with the EU Commission was reached, Mosley feared that the FIA was losing control over the sport following a heated argument with Ecclestone in Paris. Ecclestone argued that he had built Formula One into the entity that it was and the FIA only had rights to designate the event as official. Ecclestone threatened to [...] "do a scorched earth" [...] if another party were to gain control of the commercial side of Formula One. Mosley came up with the solution in order for the FIA to retain its sporting management role and Ecclestone to retain his commercial role.|$|E
40|$|The {{promise of}} {{business}} performance improvement ismillions of US dollars in annual cost savings andproduct quality improvements. The {{risk is that}} even a company that dramatically improves its efficiency and product quality can fail miserably.

Improving the performance <b>of</b> the <b>IT</b> organization can accelerate the business to greater performance. That is the promise <b>of</b> improving <b>IT</b> performance. The risk when the IT organization does not deliver is that the whole organization suffers, losing assets, sales, customers and momentum, or even goes under. Improving and sustaining business performance requires resources. These are indirect, overhead or risk mitigation costs and show up on the business’s income statement as overhead. The IT organization represents a significant part of this overhead. With constant pressure to decrease overhead, the IT organization represents an attractive target for cost reduction. At the same time, <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>IT’s</b> operational and maintenance costs sustain performance and mitigate risks.
