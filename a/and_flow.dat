Three—the Milk and Saint Lawrence rivers and the Red River of the North—{{begin in the}} United States <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> into Canada. Of these, only the Milk River crosses the international border twice, leaving and then re-entering the United States. Two rivers, the Colorado and the Rio Grande, begin in the United States <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> into or form a border with Mexico. In addition, the drainage basins of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers extend into Canada, and the basin of the Gila River extends into Mexico.|$|E

5|$|After the {{shakeout}} of {{the casting}} it is inspected for defects. The most common defects are misruns and cold shuts. These defects {{can be caused}} by cold dies, low metal temperature, dirty metal, lack of venting, or too much lubricant. Other possible defects are gas porosity, shrinkage porosity, hot tears, <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> marks. Flow marks are marks left {{on the surface of the}} casting due to poor gating, sharp corners, or excessive lubricant.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the nineteenth century, the works of Sir Walter Scott were best-sellers in France. His novels {{captured}} the ebb <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> of society, and he demonstrated the far-reaching impact of major historical changes. A slew of authors in France attempted to replicate Scott's success, but their works were isolated from one another and divorced from their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|Bath {{was charged}} with {{responsibility}} for the hot springs in a Royal Charter of 1591 granted by Elizabeth I. This duty has now passed to Bath and North East Somerset Council, who carry out monitoring of pressure, temperature <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> rates. The thermal waters contain sodium, calcium, chloride and sulphate ions in high concentrations.|$|E
5|$|Demographically weakened, the Mongols {{were not}} able to exert their rule over remote domains in their empire, who began to revolt once the plague broke out. These revolts {{disrupted}} the production of goods <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> of trade, which ended the Pax Mongolica.|$|E

5|$|During the ice ages of {{the last}} two million years the Tibetan plateau and the Himalayas have been covered by the {{expanded}} polar ice cap several times. As the ice moved it eroded the rock, filling the river canyons with gravel. In some sections the rivers have cut through the gravel <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> swiftly over bedrock, and in some areas large boulders have fallen into the rivers and formed rapids.|$|E
5|$|This formula neglects the {{cracking}} pressure required to open both {{first and second}} stages of the regulator, and pressure drop due to flow restrictions in the regulator, {{both of which are}} variable depending on the design and adjustment of the regulator, <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> rate, which depends on the breathing pattern of the diver and the gas in use. These factors are not easily estimated, so the calculated value for breathing duration will be more than the real value.|$|E
5|$|As {{military}} governor, Johnson {{sought to}} eliminate rebel {{influence in the}} state. He demanded loyalty oaths from public officials, and shut down all newspapers owned by Confederate sympathizers. Much of eastern Tennessee remained in Confederate hands, and the ebb <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> of war during 1862 sometimes brought Confederate control again close to Nashville. However, the Confederates allowed his wife and family {{to pass through the}} lines to join him. Johnson undertook the defense of Nashville as best he could, though the city was continually harassed by cavalry raids led by General Nathan Bedford Forrest. Relief from Union regulars did not come until William S. Rosecrans defeated the Confederates at Murfreesboro in early 1863. Much of eastern Tennessee was captured later that year.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} development, {{multiple}} {{members of}} staff voiced dissatisfaction with the final product. Ito and Suzuki felt that the portrayals of the Law and Chaos Heroes were imbalanced, with the Chaos Hero being too emotional and the Law Hero being unsympathetic. They also saw the demon fusion system as too difficult for players to master. Okada, while commenting on what improvements would {{be made for the}} next game, stated that there were too many useless items in the game. Niino felt that the game's pacing <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> needed to be addressed, as after naming the characters, the player immediately is prompted to divide their status points.|$|E

He then moved to the United States, where {{he earned a}} master's degree from the University of Southern California's Interactive Media Division. While there he created Cloud <b>and</b> <b>Flow,</b> and met fellow student Kellee Santiago. After a brief period at Maxis working on Spore, he founded Thatgamecompany with Santiago and became the company's creative director. The company signed a three-game deal with Sony Computer Entertainment, and has sold Flow, Flower, and Journey through the PlayStation Network.|$|E
5|$|De Lucía {{was widely}} {{considered}} to be the world's premier flamenco guitarist and by many to be Spain's greatest musical export. He had a revolutionary influence on flamenco music both as a composer and otherwise. His influence on flamenco guitar has been compared with that of Andrés Segovia's on classical guitar. His album Fuente y Caudal (Fountain <b>and</b> <b>Flow)</b> has been cited by many to have changed the world of flamenco guitar beyond traditional flamenco culture. Along with Enrique Morente and Camarón de la Isla, de Lucía was the first artist to break away from traditional flamenco and form what is now known as nuevo flamenco. As a composer, de Lucía was the first Spanish artist to mix jazz with Andalusian music in a more or less systematic way. This includes, but is not limited to, his collaborations with Di Meola, McLaughlin, and Pedro Iturralde.|$|E

5|$|HeliumII is a superfluid, {{a quantum}} {{mechanical}} state (see: macroscopic quantum phenomena) of matter with strange properties. For example, when it flows through capillaries {{as thin as}} 10−7 to 10−8m it has no measurable viscosity. However, when measurements were done between two moving discs, a viscosity {{comparable to that of}} gaseous helium was observed. Current theory explains this using the two-fluid model for helium II. In this model, liquid helium below the lambda point is viewed as containing a proportion of helium atoms in a ground state, which are superfluid <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> with exactly zero viscosity, and a proportion of helium atoms in an excited state, which behave more like an ordinary fluid.|$|E
5|$|Rivers {{and streams}} in the Colorado basin were once home to 49 species of native fish, of which 42 were endemic. Engineering {{projects}} and river regulation {{have led to}} the extinction of four species and severe declines in the populations of 40 species. Bonytail chub, razorback sucker, Colorado pikeminnow, and humpback chub are among those considered the most at risk; all are unique to the Colorado River system and well adapted to the river's natural silty conditions <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> variations. Clear, cold water released by dams has significantly changed characteristics of habitat for these and other Colorado River basin fishes. A further 40 species that occur in the river today, notably the brown trout, were introduced during the 19th and 20thcenturies, mainly for sport fishing.|$|E
5|$|The {{north coast}} is gently {{shelving}} with low cliffs and {{long stretches of}} sandy beach, some sections of which, especially in the northwest, are muddy. The principal coastal feature is Bridgwater Bay, and the only important harbour is at the mouths of the Parrett. The main rivers in Somerset rise in the hills <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> northwards and westwards into the Bristol Channel; these are the Axe, Brue, Parrett and its tributaries, and Exe. The source of the River Axe is at Wookey Hole Caves in the Mendip Hills. It flows through a ravine and then west through the village of Wookey. It splits into two parts which subsequently recombine, and flows across the moors, through Lower Weare and {{to the south of}} Loxton. It passes between Uphill Cliff and Brean Down and reaches the sea at Weston Bay; it forms the northern boundary of the county.|$|E
5000|$|... 2. Another {{tributary}} {{is formed}} by the stream originating at Illikkal kallu near Thalanadu <b>and</b> <b>flowing</b> through Mankombu <b>and</b> Vakakkadu and the stream originating in the Melukavu hills <b>and</b> <b>flowing</b> through Edamaruku. These two streams join together at Randattumunni at Edamaruku <b>and</b> <b>flows</b> south-eastwards <b>and</b> joins with Teekoy River at Ettonnil Kadavu near Kalathukadavu <b>and</b> <b>flows</b> southward to enter the northern side of Erattupetta (meaning a confluence of two streams). At Erattupetta it joins south of Aruvithura the third tributary, Poonjar, which enters the southern side of Erattupetta. Aruvithura forane Church is a famous church that is situated on the left bank of Meenachil river at Erattupetta.|$|R

5|$|Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, several {{projects}} went {{underway to}} improve the city water available to the tenants of Four Seasons Mall. Nearby Northwood Lake {{was included in the}} projects; as several channels between the lake and the mall had eroded. The channels affected in the projects provided water to nearly 285 acres of land in Plymouth. Several initiatives such as ponding, stream restoration, <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> restriction were considered {{to improve the}} quality of the water. In mid 2015, all of the improvement projects were finalized following two years of channel work.|$|E
5|$|Two {{or three}} feet of snow may turn into less than a foot of ice. The weight above makes deeper layers of ice thin <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> outwards. Ice is lost {{at the edges of}} the glacier to icebergs, or to summer melting, and the overall shape of the glacier does not change much with time. The outward flow can distort the layers, so it is {{desirable}} to drill deep ice cores at places where there is very little flow. These can be located using maps of the flow lines.|$|E
5|$|Until the mid-eighteenth {{century the}} Old London Bridge {{was the only}} {{crossing}} on the Thames in London. It was damaged in a major fire in 1633, but in the fire of 1666 this damage acted as a fire break and prevented the flames from further damaging the bridge and crossing to {{the south side of}} the Thames. With its 19 narrow arches, it impeded river traffic <b>and</b> <b>flow.</b> Central piers were removed to create a wider navigational span. Widening and the removal of its houses was completed in 1763, but it remained relatively narrow and needed continual and expensive repairs. In the early nineteenth century it was decided to replace the bridge with a new construction. New London Bridge was opened in 1831 and survived until it was replaced in 1972. It was then transported and reconstructed in Lake Havasu City, Arizona.|$|E
