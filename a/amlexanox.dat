5000|$|Reduced {{expression}} of this protein has {{been implicated in}} cardiomyopathies, and left ventricular assist device-based therapy does not restore S100A1 levels in patients. S100A1 has shown promise as an early diagnostic biomarker for acute myocardial ischemia, presenting with a distinct timecourse in human plasma following an ischemic event relative to traditional markers creatine kinase, CKMB and troponin I. This injury-released, extracellular pool of S100A1 was investigated in neonatal murine cardiomyocytes and was shown to prevent apoptosis via an ERK1/2-dependent pathway, suggesting that the release of S100A1 from injured cells is an intrinsic survival mechanism for viable myocardium. [...] S100 has also shown promise as a biomarker for uncontrolled hyperoxic reoxygenation during cardiopulmonary bypass in infants with cyanotic heart disease and in adults. S100A1 gene transfer to engineered heart tissue was shown to augment contractile performance of the tissue implants, suggesting that S100A1 may be effective in facilitating cardiac tissue replacement therapy in heart failure patients. However, the clinical efficacy of this strategy remains to be determined.In addition, multiple drugs, including Pentamidine, <b>Amlexanox,</b> Olopatadine, Cromolyn, and Propanolol, are known to bind to S100A1, although their affinities are often in the mid-micromolar range.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Amlexanox</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} as a 5 percent topical oral paste {{for the treatment of}} patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) in most European countries. However, it is not yet available in China and has not been generally accepted in clinical treatment. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the effectiveness of <b>amlexanox</b> oral adhesive pellicles in the treatment of minor recurrent aphthous ulcers, and compare the results with those of <b>amlexanox</b> oral adhesive tablets in order to analyse the difference between the two dosage forms of <b>amlexanox.</b> Methods We performed a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel, multicenter clinical study. A total of 216 patients with minor recurrent aphthous ulcers (MiRAU) were recruited and randomized to <b>amlexanox</b> pellicles or placebo pellicles. Pellicles were consecutively applied four times per day, for five days. The size and pain level of ulcers were measured and recorded on treatment days 0, 4 and 6. Finally, the results were compared with those of our previous 104 cases treated with <b>amlexanox</b> tablets. Results <b>Amlexanox</b> oral adhesive pellicles significantly reduced ulcer size (P= 0. 017 for day 4, P= 0. 038 for day 6) and alleviated ulcer pain (P= 0. 021 for day 4, P= 0. 036 for day 6). No significant difference was observed in the treatment effectiveness between the pellicle and tablet form of <b>amlexanox.</b> Conclusions <b>Amlexanox</b> oral adhesive pellicles are as effective and safe as <b>amlexanox</b> oral adhesive tablets in the treatment of MiRAU for this Chinese cohort. However, pellicles seem to be more comfortable to use when compared with the dosage form of tablets. Therefore, in clinical practice, <b>amlexanox</b> oral adhesive pellicles may be a better choice for RAS patients. Trials registration Nederlands Trial Register NTR 1727. </p...|$|E

Materials and Methods: The present study was conducted on 100 patients diagnosed to have recurrent minor aphthous ulcers of which, 50 patients were advised to apply 5 % <b>amlexanox</b> oral paste directly on the ulcer 4 times a day for 6 days and the other 50 patients were given placebo paste for the same duration. The baseline parameters were recorded on the first visit which includes ulcer size, pain, erythema and exudation. Efficacy and safety evaluations were made on the 4 th day and 6 th day. In total 30 patients with increased frequency of ulcers were advised to use 5 % <b>amlexanox</b> paste for one whole year and the number of ulcers per month was recorded to evaluate any decrease in the recurrence rate. Results: Male patients dominated the study with 73 males and 27 females. The mean age of the total sample was 26. 6 years. The <b>amlexanox</b> group showed marked reduction in ulcer size (P < 0. 001), significant reduction in the visual analog scale scores of pain (P < 0. 001), significant lower scores of erythema and exudation (P < 0. 001) when compared to the placebo group on the 6 th day of follow-up.

Since the physiological function of Hsp 90 is not yet fully understood, the development of specific antagonists might open new lines of investigation on the role of Hsp 90. In an effort to discover Hsp 90 antagonists, we screened many drugs and found that the anti-allergic drugs DSCG (disodium cromoglycate) and <b>amlexanox</b> target Hsp 90. Both drugs were found to bind directly wild-type Hsp 90 via the N- and C-terminal domains. Both drugs strongly suppressed the in vitro chaperone activity of native Hsp 90 towards citrate synthase at 1. 5 - 3. 0 microM. <b>Amlexanox</b> suppressed C-terminal chaperone activity in vitro, but not N-terminal chaperone activity, and inhibited the association of cohort proteins, such as cyclophilin 40 and Hsp-organizing protein, to the C-terminal domain of Hsp 90.

40|$|Abstract Background Nonsense {{mutations}} are at {{the origin}} of many cancers and inherited genetic diseases. The consequence of nonsense mutations is often the absence of mutant gene expression due to the activation of an mRNA surveillance mechanism called nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD).

Methods Using a dedicated screening system, we sought molecules capable to block NMD. Additionally, 3 cell lines derived from patient cells and harboring a nonsense mutation were used to study {{the effect of the}} selected molecule on the level of nonsense-containing mRNAs and the synthesis of proteins from these mutant mRNAs.

All of these drugs, which have different structures but similar function, scarcely bound to calmodulin in bovine lung extract, but bound to {{the same kinds of}} calcium-binding proteins, such as the 10 -kDa proteins isolated in this study, calcyphosine and annexins I-V. The 10 -kDa proteins obtained on three drug-coupled resins and on phenyl-Sepharose were analysed by reversed-phase HPLC. It was found that two characteristic 10 -kDa proteins, one polar and one less polar, were bound with all three drugs, although S 100 A 2 (S 100 L), of the S 100 family, was bound with phenyl-Sepharose. The cDNA and deduced amino acid sequence proved our major polar protein to be identical with the calcium-binding protein in bovine amniotic fluid (CAAF 1, S 100 A 12). The cDNA and deduced amino acid sequence of the less-polar protein shared 95 % homology with human and mouse S 100 A 13.

In this study, we examined the possibility that the interaction of olopatadine with S 100 A 12 inhibits the proinflammatory effects of S 100 A 12. Pretreatment of olopatadine with S 100 A 12 reduced migration of THP- 1, a monocyte cell line, induced by S 100 A 12 alone, but did not affect recombinant human regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) -induced migration. <b>Amlexanox,</b> which also binds to S 100 A 12, inhibited the THP- 1 migration induced by S 100 A 12.

40|$|AbstractProtein {{translocation}} {{between different}} subcellular compartments might {{play a significant}} role in various signal transduction pathways. The S 100 family is comprised of the multifunctional, small, acidic proteins, some of which translocate in the form of vesicle-like structures upon increase in intracellular Ca 2 + levels. Previously, cells were fixed before and after calcium activation in order to examine the possible relocation of S 100 proteins. In this study, we were able to track the real-time translocation. We compared the localization of endogenous S 100 A 11 to that of the S 100 A 11 -green fluorescent protein. The application of thapsigargin, an agent increasing intracellular Ca 2 + levels, resulted in the relocation of the S 100 A 11. In contrast, addition of EGTA, which specifically binds Ca 2 +, either inhibited the ongoing process of translocation or prevented its induction. Since translocation was not affected by treatment with brefeldin A, it appears that S 100 A 11 relocates in an endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi-independent pathway. Furthermore, the depolymerization of actin filaments by <b>amlexanox</b> did not affect the capacity of S 100 A 11 to translocate. However, the time course treatment with demecolcine, which depolymerizes tubulin filaments, resulted in cease of translocation, suggesting that the tubulin network is required for this process...|$|E

Although biochemical evidence suggests that the formation of a multiprotein complex containing S 100 A 13 and Synaptotagmin (Syt) 1 is important for the release of FGF 1, it is unclear where this intracellular complex is assembled. As a result, we employed real-time analysis using confocal fluorescence microscopy to study the spatio-temporal aspects of this nonclassical export pathway and demonstrate that heat shock stimulates the redistribution of FGF 1 from a diffuse cytosolic pattern to a locale near the inner surface of the plasma membrane where it colocalized with S 100 A 13 and Syt 1. In addition, coexpression of dominant-negative mutant forms of S 100 A 13 and Syt 1, which both repress the release of FGF 1, failed to inhibit the stress-induced peripheral redistribution of intracellular FGF 1. However, <b>amlexanox,</b> a compound that is known to attenuate actin stress fiber formation and FGF 1 release, was able to repress this process.

Accordingly, overexpression and constitutive activation of NF-kappa B have also been shown in melanoma, however, the role of IKK epsilon in this cancer type has not been investigated so far. Thus, we determined IKK epsilon expression in malignant melanoma cells {{and we were able to}} show a significant overexpression of IKKe in tumour cells in comparison to melanocytes. Inhibition of IKK epsilon either by shRNA or the pharmacological inhibitor <b>amlexanox</b> resulted in reduced cell proliferation associated with a cell cycle block in the G 1 -phase. Functional analysis indicated that NF-kappa B, Akt 1 and MAPK pathways might be involved in the IKK epsilon-mediated effects. In vivo, we applied a mouse melanoma skin cancer model to assess tumour growth and melanoma-associated pain in IKK epsilon knockout mice as well as C 57 BL/ 6 mice after inoculation with IKK epsilon-negative cells. In Has knockout mice, tumour growth was not altered as compared to IKK epsilon wild type mice. However, melanoma associated pain was strongly suppressed accompanied by a reduced mRNA expression of a number of pain-relevant genes.

Although both FGF 1 and S 100 A 13 are Cu 2 +-binding proteins, the role of Cu 2 +, {{as well as that}} of Ca 2 +, in non-classical release, remains to be clarified. In the present study we examined the requirements of both metal ions for the interaction between these two proteins. The addition of Ca 2 + significantly increased the ka value, while decreasing the KD value, for the interaction between Strep-tagII-S 100 A 13 and GST-FGF 1; both values were obtained by use of a quartz crystal microbalance, a real-time mass-measuring device. The EC 50 of Ca 2 + to enhance the interaction was 10. 11 μM. Although the addition of Cu 2 + alone had no effect, it caused a marked potentiation of the Ca 2 +-enhanced interaction. The EC 50 of Cu 2 + for the potentiation was 50. 45 nM. On the other hand, the EC 50 of Ca 2 + and the KD values were decreased from 11. 69 to 2. 07 μM and 0. 75 to 0. 38 × 10 − 7 M, respectively, by the addition of 200 nM Cu 2 +. The Cu 2 +-induced potentiation of this interaction was abolished by <b>amlexanox,</b> which inhibits non-classical release of FGF 1. All of these findings suggest that synergistic effects of Ca 2 + and Cu 2 + play a key role in the interaction between FGF 1 and S 100 A 13, which is the initial step in non-classical release of FGF 1...|$|E
40|$|G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) {{are often}} {{described}} as ‘gate-keepers’ of the eukaryotic cell and their roles primarily involve translating extra-cellular stimuli via G protein coupling and intracellular signalling to govern various physiological responses. These functional parameters are wide ranging and include the modulation of visual sensory organs, to the control of vasoreactivity and heart rate. Importantly, their flexible architecture can facilitate small molecule interaction within a ‘binding-pocket’ and GPCR research often focuses on this relationship to identify and design novel and effective ligands to manipulate GPCR activation and signalling. GPR 35 is a poorly characterised, Class A GPCR and despite reports of two potential endogenous activators; kynurenic acid (KYNA) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in recent years, it is still widely acknowledged as an ‘orphaned’ GPCR. This is reflected by the propensity of its ligands, both endogenous and synthetic, to demonstrate extreme species orthologue-selective properties. Despite this, investigators have highlighted various roles for GPR 35 relating to pain, inflammation, hypertension and heart failure, and investigations have suggested that activation of GPR 35 leads to a selective coupling of Gα 13, a G-protein understood to mediate Rho A and ROCK 1 / 2 signalling. However, a lack of functional ligand pairs has hampered further research to examine a role for GPR 35 and subsequent Gα 13 signalling in these disease models. In this study, we have characterised a series of highly-potent, synthetic ligands at human, rat and mouse orthologues of GPR 35, revealing that GPR 35 agonist, pamoic acid and antagonists, CID- 2745687 and ML- 145, are highly potent and selective for the human orthologue of GPR 35. This has provided us {{with the opportunity to}} assess a functional role for GPR 35 within a cardiovascular disease setting using functional ligand pairs in cells of a human origin, for the first time. Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration and proliferation are central to neointima formation in vein graft failure. Despite a detailed understanding of VSMC migration and proliferation mechanisms, there are no pharmacological interventions which effectively prevent vein graft failure through intimal occlusion. In this study, we demonstrated that primary vascular cells expressed robustly detectable levels of GPR 35, and these were comparable to those demonstrated in the colon, which has been previously reported to highly express GPR 35. Human GPR 35 is potently activated by the selective agonist pamoic acid and reference ligand zaprinast and blocked by antagonists CID- 2745687 and ML- 145. Following exposure of VSMC to pamoic acid or zaprinast, cell migration was enhanced and these effects were blocked by co-incubation with CID- 2745687 or ML- 145. Pamoic acid induced HSV SMC migration was also blocked in the presence of two distinct Rho A pathway inhibitors, Y- 16 and Y- 27632. Activation of this pathway was also reflected by remodelling of the cytoskeletal architecture in HSV SMCs to significantly elongate the cell and promote a contractile, migratory phenotype following pamoic acid stimulation and this effect was also blocked following co-administration with either antagonist. Additionally, we also demonstrated that following exposure to pamoic acid or zaprinast, human saphenous vein endothelial cell (HSV EC) integrity and proliferation were significantly improved and this was blocked following co-administration with either antagonist, suggesting a protective role for GPR 35 in the vascular endothelium. Results from a previous study demonstrated that lack of GPR 35 expression resulted in an elevation in systolic blood pressure (SBP) by up to 37. 5 mmHg in mice. The recent identification of mast-cell stabilising compounds as highly potent agonists at GPR 35 provided the opportunity to pharmacologically target GPR 35 within a rodent model of hypertension. Therefore, we also aimed to test if pharmacological manipulation of GPR 35 via stimulation with the novel, rodent selective agonist <b>amlexanox,</b> modulated blood pressure and end-organ related damage in 6 - 12 weeks of age stroke prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSPs). Radiotelemetry acquisition of haemodynamic properties highlighted that pharmacological agonism of GPR 35 exacerbated hypertension and end-organ damage in the SHRSP and this was evident following an elevation in SBP by 20 mmHg throughout the trial. Moreover, quantification of heart mass and cardiomyocyte size revealed that GPR 35 agonism induced cardiac hypertrophy. Collagen staining revealed enhanced renal fibrosis in both the interstitial and perivascular regions of the kidney from <b>amlexanox</b> treated animals, compared to vehicle controls. Additionally, large vessel myography highlighted that endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation was reduced by 20...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} implicated an {{inflammatory}} link between obesity and type 2 diabetes. We applied a multidisciplinary approach spanning from in vivo animal physiology to in vitro cell culture and biochemistry {{to address the}} role of obesity-related inflammation in adipose tissue. The inhibitor of κB kinase β (IKKβ) has previously been linked to insulin resistance. High-fat diet dramatically increased protein and kinase activity levels of the two noncanonical IKK family members, IKKε and TBK 1, in adipose tissue. Genetic ablation of IKKε or pharmacologic inhibition of IKKε and TBK 1, using the selective protein kinase inhibitor <b>amlexanox,</b> resulted in many metabolic improvements, including reduced weight gain in mice on a high fat diet. The improvements in IKKε knockout and amlexanox-treated mice on a high fat diet were correlated with increased energy expenditure, core body temperature, adipogenesis, and the proton uncoupling protein, UCP 1 protein levels in adipose tissue. Studies with 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes elucidated the mechanism by which IKKε and TBK 1 regulate cAMP and β-adrenergic signaling in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. Expression of IKKε in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes decreased UCP 1 expression in response to β-adrenergic stimulation. The rate of lipolysis, levels of cAMP, and phosphorylation of PKA substrates such as hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) were also diminished in response to isoproterenol or forskolin by overexpression of IKKε or TBK 1 in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. IKKε and TBK 1 are induced by inflammatory stimuli, such as tumor necrosis α (TNFα) and Poly(I:C), and blockade of these kinases reversed the diminution of β-adrenergic signaling, cAMP, and lipolysis. The reduction of cAMP levels in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes expressing IKKε or TBK 1 was reversed by the phosphodiesterase 3 B inhibitor, zardaverine. IKKε and TBK 1 were found to bind to and phosphorylate PDE 3 B at serine 318, resulting in its activation and 14 - 3 - 3 β binding. These studies suggest that reduced cAMP production through phosphorylation and activation of PDE 3 B by IKKε and TBK 1 is responsible for mediating the effects of IKKε and TBK 1 in adipocytes...|$|E
40|$|Cancer is {{the second}} {{leading cause of death}} in the USA and it is {{expected}} to surpass heart diseases making it important to understand the underlying mechanisms of cancer. The efforts to target single signaling molecule showed little success in increasing the patient survival and it can be due to increased compensation for cell survival by alternative pathway activations. Hence comprehensive understanding of the alternative signaling pathways may help us treat cancer better. Chronic inflammation is attributed to increased risk of cancer and emerging studies show the growing importance of both canonical and non-canonical IκB kinases such as IKKα, IKKβ, IKBKE and TBK 1 in human cancer pathogenesis. Initially identified as activator of NFκB pathway, IKBKE was shown to play an important oncogenic role by regulating multiple pathways downstream. Although IKBKE is implicated in tumorigenesis for over a decade, therapeutic targeting of this pathway has been a challenge. Recently, <b>amlexanox</b> and CYT 387, which are in clinical trials for Type II diabetes and myeloproliferative disorders respectively, were identified as potential IKBKE inhibitors. In this study, we uncovered specific novel mechanisms of activation of IKBKE in tumor cells and the outcomes of targeting IKBKE pathway. Oncogenic mutations are a cause of several human malignancies. Mutations in EGFR are observed in 15 % of non-small cell lung cancer patients. While cells expressing these mutations respond better to the first generation TKIs, patients become resistant to these inhibitors due to secondary mutations in EGFR. These mutations were shown to make EGFR constitutively active {{even in the absence of}} ligands. Direct targeting of EGFR with secondary mutations has been challenging as EGFR acquires novel mutations upon inhibitor treatment, which confer resistance to the EGFR-TKIs. Hence, it is important to improve our knowledge of the downstream signaling pathways of EGFR. Although PI 3 K, MEK signaling are well established, mutant EGFR was shown to activate several novel signaling pathways such as miRNA processing and autophagy that are implicated in resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Here, we show that IKBKE acts downstream of mutant EGFR to activate the NFκB and AKT pathways. In addition, we show that mutant EGFR but not wildtype EGFR can directly phosphorylate IKBKE at Tyrosine 153 and Tyrosine 179 residues that are important for activation of IKBKE kinase. We also found that the IKBKE/TBK 1 inhibitor <b>Amlexanox</b> exhibits increased efficacy in inhibiting cell viability in NSCLC cells with activating EGFR mutations. Furthermore, we also found that IKBKE inhibitors activate the MAPK pathway, and EGFR-TKI resistant NSCLCs exhibit enhanced response to co-treatment with IKBKE inhibitors and MEK inhibitors. Similar to lung cancer, pancreatic cancer is a challenging disease due to lack of direct inhibitors of the KRas mutations that are observed in more than 95 % of pancreatic cancer patients. IKBKE/TBK 1 pathway is important for KRas signaling, but the efficacy of IKBKE inhibitors in pancreatic cancers is not well studied. Here, we show that IKBKE is an important target in pancreatic cancers that regulates pancreatic cell viability, cell migration and cancer stem cells. Importantly, we provide mechanistic insights into the effects of IKBKE inhibitors on specific signaling pathways. We found that IKBKE inhibition results in significantly increased expression of RTKs, such as ErbB 3 and IGF 1 -R, which increases ERK 1 / 2 activation. Our findings provide support for novel combination strategies for pancreatic cancer. Metastasis is a poor prognostic factor for ovarian cancer. Although patients with early stage ovarian cancer with no distal metastasis exhibit a 70 % 5 -year survival rate, Stage IV patients with distal metastasis exhibit only 20 % 5 -year survival rate. Hence, ongoing efforts are aimed at targeting the pathways that regulate metastasis in ovarian cancers. IKBKE is upregulated in ovarian cancer patients, and IKBKE expression is known to regulate the expression of several genes important for cell motility in ovarian cancers. IKBKE is also implicated in chemo-resistance in ovarian cancer, and siRNA knockdown of IKBKE increases sensitivity towards chemotherapy. However, the mechanistic role of IKBKE in chemo-resistance in ovarian cancer is not known. EphA 2 is another well studied oncogene in ovarian cancer as 70 % of ovarian cancer patients exhibit elevated levels of EphA 2. By activating Focal Adhesion Kinases (FAK), EphA 2 can induce metastasis in ovarian cancers. In this study, we show that the clinical PARP inhibitor Olaparib (AZD 2281) activates IKBKE by EphA 2 -mediated tyrosine phosphorylation. We also found that phosphorylation of EphA 2 or IKBKE expression can be used as a biomarker for olaparib resistance. Together, these studies have shed light on novel mechanisms of regulation of IKBKE and their importance in therapy resistance. These observations form a strong pre-clinical proof-of-concept to study the inhibitors further in the clinic...|$|E
40|$|G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are an {{important}} source of drug targets with diverse therapeutic applications. Orphan GPCRs, which have unknown endogenous ligands or physiological functions, represent a pool of potential therapeutic targets that could provide novel or improved treatments {{for a wide range of}} diseases. G protein-coupled receptor 35 (GPR 35) is an orphan receptor that has been associated with several diseases and physiological processes, including gastrointenstinal disease, pain transduction, inflammation and cardiovascular disease. However, the precise function of GPR 35 in these processes is yet to be elucidated. Cardiovascular disease, including hypertension and heart failure, remains a large global disease burden, suggesting that current treatments are inadequate and that novel insights might be beneficial. Therefore, the role of GPR 35 in cardiovascular disease was investigated in order to assess its potential as a therapeutic target. To provide insight into the potential mechanisms of GPR 35 actions in the cardiovascular system, GPR 35 signalling was investigated in detail in vitro. Agonist-dependent phosphorylation was observed at five sites in the GPR 35 C‑terminal tail, which differentially influenced β‑arrestin recruitment. Both agonist-dependent phosphorylation and β‑arrestin‑ 1 / 2, but not Gα 12 / 13, were essential for agonist-induced internalisation of GPR 35, {{an important}} process in the desensitisation of the G protein-mediated response. Conversely, agonist-induced reorganisation of the actin cytoskeleton was dependent on Gα 12 / 13, but not phosphorylation or β‑arrestin. To assess the role of GPR 35 in cardiovascular disease, its actions were investigated in three in vivo models. A GPR 35 knockout mouse had no abnormal cardiovascular phenotype under basal conditions, with no detectable differences in blood pressure, cardiac function, vascular reactivity or end-organ morphology compared with the wild type background strain. However, GPR 35 knockout mice were resistant to hypertension and cardiac dysfunction induced by 2 ‑week infusion of angiotensin II. Furthermore, administration of the GPR 35 agonist <b>amlexanox</b> exacerbated both hypertension and end-organ damage in the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat. These findings demonstrate a pathological role for GPR 35 in the development of hypertension and its associated end-organ damage. It is likely that this is a result of Gα 13 -mediated effects of GPR 35 on the actin cytoskeleton in cardiovascular tissues, although this requires further investigation in primary cell models. These studies suggest that antagonism of GPR 35 could be a novel therapeutic strategy to treat hypertension and/or heart failure. The findings must now be validated by antagonising GPR 35 in in vivo disease models, in order to evaluate the therapeutic value of this strategy...|$|E
