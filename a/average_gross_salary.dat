40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{the problems and}} prospects of identification and assessment for achieving the final Lithuania's success of the integration into European Monetary Union since 1 st of January, 2015. So the main aim {{of this paper is}} to assess the possibilities of Lithuania fully integrate by predicting the inflation rate changes since 2014 in 6 month period. Methods of scientific literature analysis, information grouping, comparison, and generalization and detail techniques were used. One of the most effective measure, that helped Slovenia to control the inflation and finally adopt the euro, was the macro-economic model SLOPOL 6. It is a tool for forecasting macroeconomic developments over the short and medium run and for evaluating alternative policies aiming at influencing the business cycle, at stabilizing inflation. According to an econometric model, the most important variables that can affect the inflation rate is the <b>average</b> monthly <b>gross</b> <b>salary,</b> level of production capacity and national currency exchange rate, expressed in the largest export partner country‘s currency. The research results show that there is high probability that convergence criteria for inflation will be fulfilled, but there is a risk that inflation may be uncontrolled. Assuming that in period of January and June, 2014 the <b>average</b> <b>gross</b> wage and labour levels of production capability will grow at the same pace as in period of January and June, 2013 since January- April, 2014 the inflation level would increase to 1. 8 percent. To high growth of inflation is possible in this case, if during 3 months the <b>average</b> <b>gross</b> wage and level of production capabilities increase by 3 percent each, respectively, the <b>average</b> <b>gross</b> wage from 2305. 3 LTL up to 2386 LTL, the level of production capabilities from 73, 5 up to 76. - 7 percent.

The main goal of the dissertation was {{to find out whether}} the number of carried out transactions as an indicator of actual sales on the property market was in line with the indicators of property market such as average price per square meter of apartments, economic growth, GNP per capita, inflation, unemployment rate, efficient interest rate of property loans and <b>average</b> <b>gross</b> <b>salary</b> in Slovenia. The conclusion indicates that the global crisis fully influenced global and local property markets. Drops of balloon that popped with a mortgage crisis in the United States caused collapse of dynamics of house and other properties market prices around the whole world. Even the Slovene market wasn't spared; the price of apartments started to be reduced, but a bit later than in the United States. It turned out that changes in amount of actual sales are most dependent on changes in rate of economic growth, which is connected with both inflation and unemployment. Dissertation is analyzing the Slovene property market on state and regional level from the point of global crises on the Slovene property market. A correlation is analyzed between the average price per square meter of apartments and number of actual sales in Slovenia. The results show that number of transactions in housing market and actual sales are influenced (in average) only by economic growth; neither the price of apartments nor a fall of prices of loans have a statistically characteristic influence. ...|$|E
