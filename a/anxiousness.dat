25|$|Sexual {{dysfunction}} {{is especially}} common {{among people who}} have anxiety disorders. Ordinary <b>anxiousness</b> can obviously cause erectile dysfunction in men without psychiatric problems, but clinically diagnosable disorders such as panic disorder commonly cause avoidance of intercourse and premature ejaculation. Pain during intercourse is often a comorbidity of anxiety disorders among women.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{when the}} id impulses (e.g., {{desire to have}} sexual {{relations}} with a stranger) conflict with the superego (e.g., belief in societal conventions of not having sex with unknown persons), unsatisfied feelings of <b>anxiousness</b> or feelings of anxiety come to the surface. To reduce these unpleasant feelings, the ego might use defence mechanisms (conscious or unconscious blockage of the id impulses).|$|E
25|$|There are {{different}} views {{as to which}} personality dimensions are more central in regard to psychopathy. Besides dimensions described elsewhere in this article, studies have linked psychopathy to alternative dimensions such as antagonism (high), conscientiousness (low) and <b>anxiousness</b> (low, or sometimes high). Psychopathy has also been linked to high psychoticism—a theorized dimension referring to tough, aggressive or hostile tendencies. Aspects of this that appear associated with psychopathy are lack of socialization and responsibility, impulsivity, sensation-seeking (in some cases), and aggression.|$|E
500|$|They made a promo {{under this}} name with the tracks [...] "Come Share the View" [...] and [...] "Forest Fire" [...] and then {{uploaded}} {{them onto the}} internet, making the songs available to listen to on BBC Radio 1's Onemusic Unsigned. A review of the songs reads [...] "The Pride keep things subliminally lo-fi. Refreshingly simple and restrained, [...] "Come Share The View" [...] is a lesson in welding hypnotic soundscapes with white noise while showing allegiance to the school of slo-mo on [...] "Forest Fire"". The band then took its music offline to create mystery and <b>anxiousness</b> and ensure that more [...] "A" [...] representatives came to see them perform.|$|E
500|$|The episode guest starred Marcus York, as the [...] "no-nonsense" [...] {{building}} {{manager for the}} Scranton business park. York described his character as [...] "just trying to do his job". York recalls being nervous during filming, and [...] "drawing a blank" [...] on his lines during the first 'run-through', because of his <b>anxiousness</b> around the cast members, but soon Marcus [...] "smoothed-out". John Krasinski said that the van scene was his favorite to shoot, and that it [...] "will {{go down in history}} as one of the most fun moments I’ve ever been a part of". After his portrayal of the character, York received several positive fan letters, who praised his performance as the straight man in a hectic work environment.|$|E

[...] Since forgiveness requires one to discard any desire for revenge, a vengeful personality tends to not offer forgiveness and {{may continue to}} harbor feelings of vengeance long after the transgression occurred.|$|E
2500|$|Kenneth Turan {{called the}} film [...] "a {{complete}} success" [...] and the actors' performances [...] "superb," [...] including Chris Tucker in an [...] "irresistible" [...] supporting turn. Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer called the film [...] "a transcendent endeavor, from its exhilaratingly smart screenplay... to the unexpected and moving turns {{of its two}} leads." [...] Ricardo Baca of The Denver Post praised how the movie managed to maintain [...] "the laughs, giddy <b>anxiousness</b> and warm butterflies from the trailer" [...] for its entire length. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called it [...] "one of the year's best movies. It's crazy good." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Austrian field marshal's <b>anxiousness</b> is best {{explained}} by {{a letter he}} received from Emperor Francis I of Austria on 29 January. Francis wrote, [...] "We must not forget that the enemy can, from the South of France, move against our left, where the allies have few men, {{and that it is}} very necessary to hold strongly the road [...] which, in case of a check, would serve for retreat". Napoleon wanted Augereau to advance toward Chalon-sur-Saône to carry out the threat that Francis feared. On 21 February, Napoleon sent Augereau a letter urging the marshal to, [...] "pull on his boots of 1793". The emperor wrote, [...] "Count Bubna has no more than 10,000 miserable troops with which to oppose you, which will disappear like a fog before the sun".|$|E
2500|$|People with anxious-preoccupied {{attachment}} type tend {{to agree}} with the following statements: [...] "I want to be completely emotionally intimate with others, but I often find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like", and [...] "I am uncomfortable being without close relationships, but I sometimes worry that others don't value me as much as I value them." [...] People with this style of attachment seek high levels of intimacy, approval, and responsiveness from their attachment figure. They sometimes value intimacy {{to such an extent that}} they become overly dependent on the attachment figure. Compared to securely attached people, people who are anxious or preoccupied with attachment tend to have less positive views about themselves. They may feel a sense of <b>anxiousness</b> that only recedes when in contact with the attachment figure. They often doubt their worth as a person and blame themselves for the attachment figure's lack of responsiveness. People who are anxious or preoccupied with attachment may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, emotional dysregulation (ED), worry, and impulsiveness in their relationships.|$|E

"Of a surety, {{when we were}} at Milan, {{we heard}} tell of a certain person of whom was demanded payment of a debt, with {{production}} of his deceased father's acknowledgment, which debt, unknown to the son, the father had paid, whereupon the man began to be very sorrowful, and to marvel that his father while dying did not tell him what he owed when he also made his will. Then in this exceeding <b>anxiousness</b> of his, his said father appeared {{to him in a}} dream, and made known to him where was the counter acknowledgment by which that acknowledgment was cancelled. Which when the young man had found and showed, he not only rebutted the wrongful claim of a false debt, but also got back his father's note of hand, which the father had not got back when the money was paid.|$|E

It was the air and attitude of a Montoni! What could more plainly speak the gloomy workings of a mind not wholly dead to every sense of humanity, in its fearful review of past scenes of guilt? Unhappy man! And the <b>anxiousness</b> of her spirits directed her eyes towards his figure so repeatedly, as to catch Miss Tilney's notice.

60|$|His Grace {{had thought}} {{so much of}} her feelings, that he had quite {{forgotten}} his own, or worn them out. Her Ladyship, too, was perhaps a little disappointed at the unexpected reconciliation. When we have screwed our courage up to the sticking point, we like not to be baulked. Both, too, perhaps--we go on perhapsing--both, too, we repeat, perhaps, could not help mutually viewing each other {{as the cause of}} much mutual care and mutual <b>anxiousness.</b> Both, too, perhaps, were a little tired, but without knowing it. The most curious thing, and which would have augured worst to a calm judge, was, that they silently seemed to agree not to understand that any alteration had really taken place between them, which, we think, was a bad sign: because a lover's quarrel, we all know, like a storm in summer, portends a renewal of warm weather or ardent feelings; and a lady is never so well seated in her admirer's heart as when those betters are interchanged which express so much, and those explanations entered upon which explain so little.|$|E
