40|$|Abstract: The {{scheduling}} problem {{addressed in this}} paper concerns a manufacturer who produces a variety of product types and operates in a make-to-order environment. Each customer order consists of known quantities of the different product types, and must be delivered as <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>shipment.</b> Periodically the manufacturer schedules the accumulated and unscheduled customer orders. Instances of this problem occur across industries in manufacturing {{as well as in}} service environments. In this paper we show that the problem of minimizing the weighted sum of customer order delivery times is unary NP-hard. We characterize the optimal schedule, solve several special cases of the problem, derive tight lower bounds, and propose several heuristic solutions. We report the results of a set of computational experiments to evaluate the lower bounding procedures and the heuristics, and t...|$|R

A critical issue in supply chain scheduling is the coordination of decisions within the chain.

30|$|As a next step, a line-back {{analysis}} was conducted to assign PIs {{for each of the}} process modules. By doing so, only PIs were selected which are relevant for each single module. Relevance is decided by {{the question of whether the}} <b>single</b> module has <b>an</b> influence on achieving a higher performance in the overarching context of this PI. For example, reflecting the right quantity of parts within one shipment is relevant during the reception of goods where it is suggested as a PI. Line-back, during truck registration, the correct quantity of parts within <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>shipment</b> can neither be influenced, nor checked: this PI is therefore not monitored for truck registration. On the other hand, following the process further line-back, this PI is again suggested for the supplier. This allows assigning to each process module only PIs that can be influenced and avoids overloading responsibles with PIs.|$|R

30|$|The {{change in}} CO 2 {{emissions}} on <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>shipment</b> basis is between − 37.8 and + 54.8  %. The average is + 4.2  %. For 1.85  % {{of the round}} trip shipments, traffic congestion leads to a reduction of the CO 2 volume emitted and for 98.15  % to an increase. CO 2 reductions of about 30  % are observed when a ‘Rigid 20 – 26  tons’ vehicle {{is used in the}} free-flow situation with a low load factor and, due to a reduction of the number of customers in the round trip as a consequence of travel time increases, a ‘Rigid 7.5 – 12  tons’ vehicle is used under normal conditions. This observation indicates the major importance of choosing the right vehicle to move the shipments. Moreover, there are slight CO 2 reductions (below 1  %) for about 0.13  % of all delivery shipments because for these shipments the itinerary is shorter in the normal situation where congested roads are avoided than in the free-flow case.|$|R

The objective is to minimize the total cost minus the revenue: the cost is due to inventory, transportation to the manufacturer, and scrapping items not returned, while the revenue is due to the refund from the manufacturer. We consider two operational strategies: sta-tic and dynamic. Under the static strategy a shipment is made to the manufacturer at a predetermined time regardless of the number of items returned, whereas under the dynamic strategy such decisions are made adaptively depending on the number of items actually re-turned. Numerical studies are performed to gain managerial insights as well as compare the performance of the static and the dynamic approaches...|$|R

Transloading concerns the mechanics of transport, while transshipment is essentially a legal term addressing how the shipment originates and is destined. Consider a load of grain that is transloaded at an elevator, where it is combined with grain from other farms and thus leaves on the train as a distinct shipment from that in which it arrived. It thus cannot {{be said to be}} transshipped. Or consider a package shipped through a package delivery service or the mails: it may change shipping mode several times along the trip, but since it is (from an external point of view) conveyed as <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>shipment</b> regardless of how it is conveyed or what else travels with it on the legs of its journey, it is not considered to be transshipped. Conversely, a load on a truck can be taken in one (legal) shipment to an intermediate point and then to its ultimate destination without ever leaving the truck. If this is specified as two shipments, then the goods are transshipped, but no transloading has taken place.|$|R

In these global supply chains, products emerging from Central Europe also play an increasingly important role today.

40|$|Although {{the supply}} chain {{management}} literature is extensive, the benefits and challenges of coordinated decision making within supply chain scheduling models have not been studied. We consider a variety of scheduling, batching, and delivery problems that arise in an arborescent supply chain where a supplier makes deliveries to several manufacturers, who also make deliveries to customers. The objective is to minimize the overall scheduling and delivery cost, using several classical scheduling objectives. This is achieved by scheduling the jobs and forming them into batches, {{each of which is}} delivered to the next downstream stage as <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>shipment.</b> For each problem, we either derive an efficient dynamic programming algorithm that minimizes the total cost of the supplier or that of the manufacturer, or we demonstrate that this problem is intractable. The total system cost minimization problem of a supplier and manufacturer who make cooperative decisions is also considered. We demonstrate that cooperation between a supplier and a manufacturer may reduce the total system cost by at least 20 %, or 25 %, or by up to 100 %, depending upon the scheduling objective. Finally, we identify incentives and mechanisms for this cooperation, thereby demonstrating that our work has practical implications for improving the efficiency of supply chains. <br/...|$|R

To begin with, any mail from America to Dawson City was sent to Juneau in South-east Alaska before being sent through Dawson and then down the Yukon to Circle City. From here it was then distributed by the US Post Office back up to Dawson. The huge distances involved resulted in delays of several months and frequently the loss of protective envelopes and their addresses. The second problem was in Dawson itself, which initially lacked a post office and therefore relied on two stores and a saloon to act as informal delivery points. The NWMP were tasked to run the mail system by October 1897, but they were ill-trained to do so. Up to 5,700 letters might arrive in <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>shipment,</b> all of which had to be collected in person from the post office.

Postage stamps, like paper in general, were scarce and rationed to two per customer. By 1899, trained postal staff took over mail delivery and relieved the NWMP of this task.|$|R
40|$|In the globalised world, {{international}} borders {{ought to}} be mere lines on the map. But {{recent studies have shown}} that informal trade barriers still exist, and inhibit trade, particularly so in the developing countries. This can arise due to a host of factors such as complex customs procedures, which sometimes change, and capacity constraints, given limited facilities and/or corruption at the border. However, non-tariff barriers of various sorts and structural impediments are less obvious and perhaps more interesting, but also much more difficult to measure directly. In this context, this paper attempts to quantify the relevant costs resulting from informal barriers that impinge upon trade between India and Bangladesh through the land customs stations (LCSs) at Petrapole (West Bengal) and Benapole (Bangladesh). The study is based on primary data collated through surveys conducted in West Bengal. Our estimates show that the aggregate delay pertaining to all the phases of exports turns out to be approximately four days for <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>shipment.</b> It also shows that the additional transaction costs in terms of delays and speed money incurred by the Indian exporters during trading with Bangladesh is about 10 per cent of shipment value. The present study has shown that informal barriers/para-tariff in India-Bangladesh trade are already high and further trade liberalisation without improving the infrastructure would be counterproductive. The paper ends with feasible policy recommendations to make trade between India and Bangladesh more vibrant. ...|$|R
