5|$|Penrose tilings, {{which use}} two {{different}} quadrilaterals, {{are the best}} known example of tiles that forcibly create non-periodic patterns. They belong to a general class of <b>aperiodic</b> tilings, which use tiles that cannot tessellate periodically. The recursive process of substitution tiling is a method of generating <b>aperiodic</b> tilings. One class that can be generated {{in this way is}} the rep-tiles; these tilings have surprising self-replicating properties. Pinwheel tilings are non-periodic, using a rep-tile construction; the tiles appear in infinitely many orientations. It might be thought that a non-periodic pattern would be entirely without symmetry, but this is not so. <b>Aperiodic</b> tilings, while lacking in translational symmetry, do have symmetries of other types, by infinite repetition of any bounded patch of the tiling and in certain finite groups of rotations or reflections of those patches. A substitution rule, such as can be used to generate some Penrose patterns using assemblies of tiles called rhombs, illustrates scaling symmetry. A Fibonacci word can be used to build an <b>aperiodic</b> tiling, and to study quasicrystals, which are structures with <b>aperiodic</b> order.|$|E
5|$|Although the Pythagorean tiling {{is itself}} {{periodic}} (it has a square lattice of translational symmetries) its cross sections {{can be used}} to generate one-dimensional <b>aperiodic</b> sequences.|$|E
5|$|Penrose tilings {{are simple}} {{examples}} of <b>aperiodic</b> tilings {{of the plane}}. A tiling is a covering of the plane by tiles with no overlaps or gaps; the tiles normally have {{a finite number of}} shapes, called prototiles, and a set of prototiles is said to admit a tiling or tile the plane if there is a tiling of the plane using only tiles congruent to these prototiles. The most familiar tilings (e.g., by squares or triangles) are periodic: a perfect copy of the tiling can be obtained by translating all of the tiles by a fixed distance in a given direction. Such a translation is called a period of the tiling; more informally, this means that a finite region of the tiling repeats itself in periodic intervals. If a tiling has no periods it is said to be non-periodic. A set of prototiles is said to be <b>aperiodic</b> if it tiles the plane but every such tiling is non-periodic; tilings by <b>aperiodic</b> sets of prototiles are called <b>aperiodic</b> tilings.|$|E
5|$|The first Penrose tiling (tiling P1 below) is an <b>aperiodic</b> set of six prototiles, {{introduced}} by Roger Penrose in a 1974 paper, {{but it is}} based on pentagons rather than squares. Any attempt to tile the plane with regular pentagons necessarily leaves gaps, but Johannes Kepler showed, in his 1619 work Harmonices Mundi, that these gaps can be filled using pentagrams (star polygons), decagons and related shapes. Traces of these ideas can also be found in the work of Albrecht Dürer. Acknowledging inspiration from Kepler, Penrose found matching rules (which can be imposed by decorations of the edges) for these shapes, obtaining an <b>aperiodic</b> set. His tiling {{can be viewed as a}} completion of Kepler's finite Aa pattern.|$|E
5|$|Structural DNA nanotechnology, {{sometimes}} abbreviated as SDN, {{focuses on}} synthesizing and characterizing nucleic acid complexes and materials where the assembly has a static, equilibrium endpoint. The nucleic acid double helix has a robust, defined three-dimensional geometry {{that makes it}} possible to predict and design the structures of more complicated nucleic acid complexes. Many such structures have been created, including two- and three-dimensional structures, and periodic, <b>aperiodic,</b> and discrete structures.|$|E
5|$|The color {{matching}} required in a tiling by Wang dominoes {{can easily be}} achieved by modifying {{the edges of the}} tiles like jigsaw puzzle pieces so that they can fit together only as prescribed by the edge colorings. Raphael Robinson, in a 1971 paper which simplified Berger's techniques and undecidability proof, used this technique to obtain an <b>aperiodic</b> set of just six prototiles.|$|E
5|$|This tiling has four-way {{rotational}} symmetry around {{each of its}} squares. When {{the ratio of the}} side lengths of the two squares is an irrational number such as the golden ratio, its cross-sections form <b>aperiodic</b> sequences with a similar recursive structure to the Fibonacci word. Generalizations of this tiling to three dimensions have also been studied.|$|E
5|$|Wang's student Robert Berger {{proved that}} the Domino Problem was {{undecidable}} (so Wang's conjecture was incorrect) in his 1964 thesis, and obtained an <b>aperiodic</b> set of 20426 Wang dominoes. He also described a reduction to 104 such prototiles; the latter did not appear in his published monograph, but in 1968, Donald Knuth detailed a modification of Berger's set requiring only 92 dominoes.|$|E
5|$|A Penrose tiling is {{an example}} of non-periodic tiling {{generated}} by an <b>aperiodic</b> set of prototiles. Penrose tilings are named after mathematician and physicist Sir Roger Penrose, who investigated these sets in the 1970s. The aperiodicity of prototiles implies that a shifted copy of a tiling will never match the original. A Penrose tiling may be constructed so as to exhibit both reflection symmetry and fivefold rotational symmetry, as in the diagram at the right.|$|E
25|$|The <b>aperiodic</b> Penrose tilings can be {{generated}} not only by an <b>aperiodic</b> set of prototiles, but also by a substitution and by a cut-and-project method. After the discovery of quasicrystals <b>aperiodic</b> tilings become studied intensively by physicists and mathematicians. The cut-and-project method of N.G. deBruijn for Penrose tilings eventually {{turned out to be}} an instance of the theory of Meyer sets. Today there is a large amount of literature on <b>aperiodic</b> tilings.|$|E
25|$|The term <b>aperiodic</b> {{has been}} used {{in a wide variety of}} ways in the {{mathematical}} literature on tilings (and in other mathematical fields as well, such as dynamical systems or graph theory, with altogether different meanings). With respect to tilings the term <b>aperiodic</b> was sometimes used synonymously with the term non-periodic. A non-periodic tiling is simply one that is not fixed by any non-trivial translation. Sometimes the term described - implicitly or explicitly - a tiling generated by an <b>aperiodic</b> set of prototiles. Frequently the term <b>aperiodic</b> was just used vaguely to describe the structures under consideration, referring to physical <b>aperiodic</b> solids, namely quasicrystals, or to something non-periodic with some kind of global order.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aperiodic</b> tilings were {{considered}} as mathematical artefacts until 1984, when physicist Dan Shechtman announced {{the discovery of}} a phase of an aluminium-manganese alloy which produced a sharp diffractogram with an unambiguous fivefold symmetry – so {{it had to be a}} crystalline substance with icosahedral symmetry. In 1975 Robert Ammann had already extended the Penrose construction to a three-dimensional icosahedral equivalent. In such cases the term 'tiling' is taken to mean 'filling the space'. Photonic devices are currently built as aperiodical sequences of different layers, being thus <b>aperiodic</b> in one direction and periodic in the other two. Quasicrystal structures of Cd-Te appear to consist of atomic layers in which the atoms are arranged in a planar <b>aperiodic</b> pattern. Sometimes an energetical minimum or a maximum of entropy occur for such <b>aperiodic</b> structures. Steinhardt has shown that Gummelt's overlapping decagons allow the application of an extremal principle and thus provide the link between the mathematics of <b>aperiodic</b> tiling and the structure of quasicrystals. Faraday waves have been observed to form large patches of <b>aperiodic</b> patterns. The physics of this discovery has revived the interest in incommensurate structures and frequencies suggesting to link <b>aperiodic</b> tilings with interference phenomena.|$|E
25|$|There {{are a few}} {{constructions of}} <b>aperiodic</b> tilings known. Some constructions are based on {{infinite}} families of <b>aperiodic</b> sets of tiles. Those constructions which have been found are mostly constructed in a few ways, primarily by forcing some sort of non-periodic hierarchical structure. Despite this, the undecidability of the Domino Problem ensures {{that there must be}} infinitely many distinct principles of construction, and that in fact, there exist <b>aperiodic</b> sets of tiles for which there can be no proof of their aperiodicity.|$|E
25|$|Several {{methods for}} {{constructing}} <b>aperiodic</b> tilings are known.|$|E
25|$|The Penrose tilings are {{the best-known}} {{examples}} of <b>aperiodic</b> tilings.|$|E
25|$|Only a few {{different}} kinds of constructions have been found. Notably, Jarkko Kari gave an <b>aperiodic</b> set of Wang tiles based on multiplications by 2 or 2/3 of real numbers encoded by lines of tiles (the encoding is related to Sturmian sequences made as the differences of consecutive elements of Beatty sequences), with the aperiodicity mainly relying {{on the fact that}} 2n/3m is never equal to 1 for any positive integers n and m. This method was later adapted by Goodman-Strauss to give a strongly <b>aperiodic</b> set of tiles in the hyperbolic plane. Shahar Mozes has found many alternative constructions of <b>aperiodic</b> sets of tiles, some in more exotic settings; for example in semi-simple Lie Groups. Block and Weinberger used homological methods to construct <b>aperiodic</b> sets of tiles for all non-amenable manifolds. Joshua Socolar also gave another way to enforce aperiodicity, in terms of alternating condition. This generally leads to much smaller tile sets than the one derived from substitutions.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the tiles}} shown below force the chair {{substitution}} structure to emerge, {{and so are}} themselves <b>aperiodic.</b>|$|E
25|$|A Markov chain {{with more}} than one state and just one out-going {{transition}} per state is either not irreducible or not <b>aperiodic,</b> hence cannot be ergodic.|$|E
25|$|This idea — {{of finding}} sets of tiles {{that can only}} admit {{hierarchical}} structures — {{has been used in}} the construction of most known <b>aperiodic</b> sets of tiles to date.|$|E
25|$|Fibonacci based constructions are {{currently}} used to model physical systems with <b>aperiodic</b> order such as quasicrystals. Crystal growth techniques {{have been used}} to grow Fibonacci layered crystals and study their light scattering properties.|$|E
25|$|For many well-behaved tilings (e.g. {{substitution}} tilings with finitely {{many local}} patterns) holds: if a tiling is non-periodic and repetitive (i.e. the each patch occurs uniformly dense throughout the tiling) {{then it is}} <b>aperiodic.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{even smaller}} set of six <b>aperiodic</b> tiles (based on Wang tiles) was {{discovered}} by Raphael M. Robinson in 1971. Roger Penrose discovered three more sets in 1973 and 1974, {{reducing the number of}} tiles needed to two, and Robert Ammann discovered several new sets in 1977.|$|E
25|$|A state i {{is said to}} be ergodic if it is <b>aperiodic</b> and {{positive}} recurrent. In other words, a state i is ergodic if it is recurrent, has a period of 1, and has finite mean recurrence time. If all states in an irreducible Markov chain are ergodic, then the chain {{is said to be}} ergodic.|$|E
25|$|Consider a {{periodic}} tiling by unit squares (it looks like infinite graph paper). Now cut one square into two rectangles. The tiling obtained {{in this way}} is non-periodic: there is no non-zero shift that leaves this tiling fixed. But clearly this example is much less interesting than the Penrose tiling. In order to rule out such boring examples, one defines an <b>aperiodic</b> tiling to be one that does not contain arbitrary large periodic parts.|$|E
25|$|Substitution tiling systems {{provide a}} rich source of <b>aperiodic</b> tilings. A set of tiles that forces a {{substitution}} structure to emerge is said to enforce the substitution structure. For example, the chair tiles shown below admit a substitution, and a portion of a substitution tiling is shown at right below. These substitution tilings are necessarily non-periodic, in precisely the same manner as described above, but the chair tile itself is not aperiodic—it is easy to find periodic tilings by unmarked chair tiles.|$|E
25|$|Non-periodic tilings {{can also}} be {{obtained}} by projection of higher-dimensional structures into spaces with lower dimensionality and under some circumstances there can be tiles that enforce this non-periodic structure and so are <b>aperiodic.</b> The Penrose tiles are {{the first and most}} famous example of this, as first noted in the pioneering work of de Bruijn. There is yet no complete (algebraic) characterization of cut and project tilings that can be enforced by matching rules, although numerous necessary or sufficient conditions are known.|$|E
25|$|The first {{specific}} {{occurrence of}} <b>aperiodic</b> tilings arose in 1961, when logician Hao Wang tried {{to determine whether}} the Domino Problem is decidable — that is, whether there exists an algorithm for deciding if a given finite set of prototiles admits a tiling of the plane. Wang found algorithms to enumerate the tilesets that cannot tile the plane, and the tilesets that tile it periodically; by this he showed that such a decision algorithm exists if every finite set of prototiles that admits a tiling of the plane also admits a periodic tiling.|$|E
25|$|A lattice {{arrangement}} (commonly {{called a}} regular arrangement) {{is one in}} which the centers of the spheres form a very symmetric pattern which only needs n vectors to be uniquely defined (in n-dimensional Euclidean space). Lattice arrangements are periodic. Arrangements in which the spheres do not form a lattice (often referred to as irregular) can still be periodic, but also <b>aperiodic</b> (properly speaking non-periodic) or random. Lattice arrangements are easier to handle than irregular ones—their high degree of symmetry makes it easier to classify them and to measure their densities.|$|E
25|$|This Markov {{chain is}} irreducible, because the ghosts can fly from every state to {{every state in}} a finite amount of time. Due to the secret passageway, the Markov chain is also <b>aperiodic,</b> because the monsters can move from any state to any state both in an even and in an uneven number of state transitions. Therefore, a unique {{stationary}} distribution exists {{and can be found}} by solving π'Q=0 subject to the constraint that elements must sum to 1. The solution of this linear equation subject to the constraint is %.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{possible}} to simulate the sense antenna by tapping a feed off the loop {{it would have been}} associated with. This is normally accomplished by placing a center tap in the tuning inductor, and then feeding that signal into the circuit as if it were from another antenna. Since the center-tap causes the signal from both vertical sections to be balanced, it creates a signal similar to a single vertical mast. When used with <b>aperiodic</b> windings, the sense circuit has to be wired into the receiver side, along with the tuning capacitor.|$|E
25|$|Even {{minor changes}} in the weather, {{physical}} layout or even bumping the chassis containing the tunable capacitors can cause the tuning to vary. For this reason a variety of systems were used to decrease {{the sensitivity of the}} radiogoniometer to mis-tuning. Primary among these was the <b>aperiodic</b> aerial concept, which described the mechanical layout of the radiogoniometer's internal wiring. By winding the sense coil wiring around a vertical cylinder, and wiring the field coils in a similar arrangement {{as close as possible to}} the sense coil, the entire circuit became capacitively coupled. A single tunable capacitor on the output from the sense coil could then be used to tune the entire system.|$|E
500|$|The {{subject of}} <b>aperiodic</b> tilings {{received}} {{new interest in}} the 1960s when logician Hao Wang noted connections between decision problems and tilings. In particular, he introduced tilings by square plates with colored edges, now known as Wang dominoes or tiles, and posed the [...] "Domino Problem": {{to determine whether a}} given set of Wang dominoes could tile the plane with matching colors on adjacent domino edges. He observed that if this problem were undecidable, then there would have to exist an <b>aperiodic</b> set of Wang dominoes. At the time, this seemed implausible, so Wang conjectured no such set could exist.|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Klotz construction" [...] for <b>aperiodic</b> {{sequences}} (Klotz is a German {{word for}} a block), one forms a Pythagorean tiling with two squares whose sizes are chosen to make the ratio between the two side lengths be an irrational numberx. Then, one chooses a line parallel {{to the sides of}} the squares, and forms a sequence of binary values from the sizes of the squares crossed by the line: a 0 corresponds to a crossing of a large square and a 1 corresponds to a crossing of a small square. In this sequence, the relative proportion of 0s and 1s will be in the ratio x:1. This proportion cannot be achieved by a periodic sequence of 0s and 1s, because it is irrational, so the sequence is <b>aperiodic.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{three types}} of Penrose tiling, P1P3, are {{described}} individually below. They have many common features: in each case, the tiles are constructed from shapes related to the pentagon (and hence to the golden ratio), but the basic tile shapes need to be supplemented by matching rules in order to tile aperiodically; these rules may be described using labeled vertices or edges, or patterns on the tile faces [...] alternatively the edge profile can be modified (e.g. by indentations and protrusions) to obtain an <b>aperiodic</b> set of prototiles.|$|E
500|$|A {{periodic}} tiling has a repeating pattern. Some special kinds include regular tilings {{with regular}} polygonal tiles {{all of the}} same shape, and Semiregular tilings with regular tiles {{of more than one}} shape and with every corner identically arranged. The patterns formed by periodic tilings can be categorized into 17 wallpaper groups. A tiling that lacks a repeating pattern is called [...] "non-periodic". An <b>aperiodic</b> tiling uses a small set of tile shapes that cannot form a repeating pattern. In the geometry of higher dimensions, a space-filling or honeycomb is also called a tessellation of space.|$|E
500|$|Two-dimensional arrays {{can be made}} {{to exhibit}} <b>aperiodic</b> {{structures}} whose assembly implements a specific algorithm, exhibiting one form of DNA computing. The DX tiles can have their sticky end sequences chosen so that they act as Wang tiles, allowing them to perform computation. A DX array whose assembly encodes an XOR operation has been demonstrated; this allows the DNA array to implement a cellular automaton that generates a fractal known as the Sierpinski gasket. [...] The third image at right shows this type of array. Another system has the function of a binary counter, displaying a representation of increasing binary numbers as it grows. These results show that computation can be incorporated into the assembly of DNA arrays.|$|E
