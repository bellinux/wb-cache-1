5|$|Many {{details of}} Monitors history <b>and</b> <b>insights</b> of {{everyday}} crew life {{have been discovered}} from correspondence sent from the various crew members {{to family and friends}} while serving aboard the ironclad. In particular the correspondence of George S. Geer, who sent more than 80 letters, often referred to as The Monitor Chronicles, to his wife Martha during the entire time of Monitors service provide many details <b>and</b> <b>insights</b> into every chapter of the ironclad's short-lived history, offering a rare perspective of a sailor's experience on the naval front during the Civil War. The letters of Acting Paymaster William F. Keeler to his wife Anna also corroborate many of the accounts of affairs that took place aboard the Monitor. The letters of Geer and Keeler are available for viewing and are housed at the Mariners' Museum in Virginia. Other crew members were interviewed later in life, like Louis Stodder, one of the last crew members to abandon Monitor minutes before she sank in a storm at sea, who was the last surviving crew member of Monitor and lived well into the 20th century.|$|E

40|$|Intuition <b>and</b> <b>insight</b> {{share similar}} {{cognitive}} and neural basis. Though, {{there are still}} some essential differences between the two. Here in this short review, we discriminated between intuition <b>and</b> <b>insight</b> in two aspects. First, intuition <b>and</b> <b>insight</b> are towards different aspects of information processing. Whereas intuition involves judgment about yes or no, insight is related to what is the solution. Second, tacit knowledge play different roles in between intuition <b>and</b> <b>insight.</b> On the one hand, tacit knowledge is conducive to intuitive judgment. On the other hand, tacit knowledge may first impede but later facilitate insight occurrence. Furthermore, we share theoretical and methodological views on how to access the distinction between intuition <b>and</b> <b>insight...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the relationships of}} self-reflection <b>and</b> <b>insight</b> with individuals’ performances on various language tasks. The Self-Reflection <b>and</b> <b>Insight</b> Scale (SRIS; Grant, Franklin, 2 ̆ 6 Langford, 2002) assessed individual differences in three factors: engagement in reflection, need for reflection, <b>and</b> <b>insight.</b> A high need for reflection {{was associated with a}} low vocabulary level and a small number of intrusive errors on a recognition task. A high level of insight was associated with a high accuracy rate and high response speed on a sentence-sensibility judgment task. In addition, groups who differed in need for reflection <b>and</b> <b>insight</b> did not differ on a working memory test, suggesting that need for reflection <b>and</b> <b>insight</b> account for the variation in the language tasks independent of working memory capacity. The findings suggest connections between self-reflection, <b>insight,</b> <b>and</b> proficiency in language processing...|$|R

5|$|Ramanujan {{spent nearly}} five years in Cambridge collaborating with Hardy and Littlewood, and {{published}} part of his findings there. Hardy and Ramanujan had highly contrasting personalities. Their collaboration was a clash of different cultures, beliefs, and working styles. In the previous few decades, the foundations of mathematics had come into question {{and the need for}} mathematically rigorous proofs recognized. Hardy was an atheist and an apostle of proof and mathematical rigour, whereas Ramanujan was a deeply religious man who relied very strongly on his intuition <b>and</b> <b>insights.</b> While in England, Hardy tried his best to fill the gaps in Ramanujan's education and to mentor him in the need for formal proofs to support his results, without hindering his inspiration - a conflict that neither found easy.|$|E
