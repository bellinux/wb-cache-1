5|$|The {{book has}} been called engagingly written, wisely researched, <b>and</b> <b>honestly</b> told. Critics admired the wit and humour. The book {{reviewer}} for The Globe and Mail admitted he grew impatient with the grand and repetitive statements about the changing global food system and the authors' hyperbole regarding their modest culinary discoveries. Compared to Kingsolver's Animal, Vegetable, Miracle, The 100-Mile Diet {{was found to be}} more compelling and easier to read, with Smith and MacKinnon more relatable and sympathetic than Kingsolver.|$|E
5|$|The social {{repression}} of the 1950s resulted in a cultural revolution in Greenwich Village. A cohort of poets, later named the Beat poets, wrote about the evils of the social organization at the time, glorifying anarchy, drugs, and hedonistic pleasures over unquestioning social compliance, consumerism, and closed mindedness. Of them, Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs—both Greenwich Village residents—also wrote bluntly <b>and</b> <b>honestly</b> about homosexuality. Their writings attracted sympathetic liberal-minded people, as well as homosexuals looking for a community.|$|E

25|$|Ma has {{received}} {{criticism from the}} DPP, the opposition party, for allegedly praising the PRC on human rights, especially during the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Protests. Departing from his usual critical view of the Communists' handling of the 1989 protests, Ma made a statement about the PRC's recent improvements in human rights. That same day, he also asked the PRC government to face its history directly <b>and</b> <b>honestly.</b>|$|E
25|$|Berkeley's biographer, J. D. Davies, wrote after {{examining}} his letters that Berkeley {{appears as a}} 'lively, friendly young man, fully aware of his dependence on the patronage of others, supportive of and loving towards his family, and genuinely enthusiastic to make a success of his chosen career', quoting a letter from William to Charles Berkeley in June 1663: I must assure you I {{think there is no}} so beggarly a trade as this if people serve truly <b>and</b> <b>honestly,</b> as I am resolved I will do, although I am never worth six pence.

25|$|In 1379 Bishop Buckingham {{confirmed}} {{an important}} ordinance of Thomas Marshall, setting apart certain {{funds for the}} education of one of the canons at Oxford. The prior alludes to the poverty of his house, which was so great that {{were it not for the}} help of friends they would not be able to live decently <b>and</b> <b>honestly,</b> and religion would be diminished. Hitherto there had not been enough canons nor enough money to set apart one for special study; but the prior now wished to do so (partly out of the profits of a chantry established by his own family), 'seeing the advantage of learning and the necessity of preaching, the priory being a populous place where a great number of people come together.' All this certainly points to a satisfactory state of the priory under Thomas Marshall, and accords well with what we know of his character from other sources.|$|E
25|$|Some authors {{suggest that}} an angakkuq could be honest in his tricks, {{believing in the}} {{phenomena}} he himself mimicked, moreover, he could consciously cheat <b>and</b> <b>honestly</b> believe at the same time. Knud Rasmussen mentioned Arnaqaoq, a young Netsilik Inuit living in King William Island. He smeared himself {{with the blood of}} a seal or reindeer, telling people that he had a battle with spirits. Rasmussen conjectured that he could honestly believe in this spirit battle experience which he mimicked with smearing blood. The personal impression of Rasmussen about this man was that he believed in the forces and spirits. As Rasmussen asked him to draw some pictures about his experiences, even his visions about spirits, Arnaqaoq was first unwilling to do so (having fear of the spirits). Later he accepted the task, and he spent hours to re-experience his visions, sometimes so lucidly that he had to stop drawing when his whole body began to quiver.|$|E

[...] The creative director of the Doom 4 prototype, Kevin Cloud, said in the same interview, [...] "As far as the upper-level creative direction, that was me driving that. <b>And</b> <b>honestly,</b> again, taking it in a direction I don't think the fans would have enjoyed." ...|$|E
500|$|... "That Still Small Voice" [...] was {{the first}} Once Upon a Time episode written by {{consulting}} producer Jane Espenson.

The beauty of the production, the care and the effort <b>and,</b> <b>honestly,</b> the expense that was put into it just made clear that was a project done {{with a lot of}} attention and love."

500|$|He {{also learned}} that art does not arise from {{suffering}} or depression, but rather from the hope to respect <b>and</b> <b>honestly</b> like the world by seeing opposites as one. This, according to Aesthetic Realism, is the deepest desire of every person, but it is opposed by the desire for contempt—the false notion that one adds to self by lessening the value of other things. [...] Koppelman’s art is permeated with his understanding of this conflict. His works are often allegories which point to the discrepancy between, {{and the need to}} integrate, opposites such as pride and humility, generosity and selfishness, idealism and cynicism. [...] “That art could be a vehicle for understanding individual behavior seems always to have inspired Koppeman’s creative process” wrote John B. Ravenal of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, noting that his works “offer intimate rendering of closely observed detail, by which, paradoxically, they evoke universal truths” ...|$|E
500|$|David Lawrence, a Democrat, {{served as}} mayor of Pittsburgh from 1946 to 1959 and as Pennsylvania's {{governor}} from 1959 to 1963. Lawrence used his political power to transform Pittsburgh's [...] political machine into a modern governmental unit that could run the city well <b>and</b> <b>honestly.</b> [...] In 1946 [...] Lawrence decided to enforce the Smoke Control Ordinance of 1941 because he believed smoke abatement was crucial for the city's future economic development. However, enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city's working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels. One round of protests came from Italian-American organizations, which called for delay in enforcing it. Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines. Despite dislike of the smoke abatement program, Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence in 1949, in part because {{many of them were}} on the city payroll.|$|E
500|$|After {{staying with}} the show for eight seasons, Gray ran into trouble when she {{requested}} the producers of the show to adjust her contract {{to allow her to}} direct, as did the contracts of male co-stars Duffy and Hagman. The request initially led to producers' firing the actress from the serial, though the decision was later reversed when Dallas star Larry Hagman threatened to quit the show unless Gray were rehired. Gray stated in an interview with TV Guide, [...] "The producers said, 'But you're doing so well.' I thought, 'Oh, look out! I'm on the warpath now.' It was a struggle, though, because it was a man's show. And they fired me. When I finally told Larry, he went with me into the office and said, 'If she doesn't come back, I don't come back.

500|$|There also {{continues}} to be debate {{about whether or not}} an alliance would have been a wise idea, and whether the Crusaders at that point in history were even relevant to the Persian-Mongol conflict. The 20th-century historian Glenn Burger said, [...] "The refusal of the Latin Christian states in the area to follow Hethum's example and adapt to changing conditions by allying themselves with the new Mongol empire must stand as one of the saddest of the many failures of Outremer." [...] This was similar to the view of Steven Runciman, who argued, [...] "Had the Mongol alliance been achieved <b>and</b> <b>honestly</b> implemented by the West, the existence of Outremer would almost certainly have been prolonged. The Mameluks would have been crippled if not destroyed; and the Ilkhanate of Persia would have survived as a power friendly to the Christians and the West". However, David Nicolle, describing the Mongols as [...] "potential allies", said that early historians were writing from the benefit of hindsight, and that overall the major players were the Mamluks and the Mongols, with Christians just [...] "pawns in a greater game." ...|$|E
500|$|Grant began {{experimenting with}} the drug LSD in the late 1950s, before it became popular. His wife, Betsy Drake, {{displayed}} {{a keen interest in}} psychotherapy, and through her Grant developed a considerable knowledge of the field of psychoanalysis. Radiologist Mortimer Hartman began treating him with LSD in the late 1950s, with Grant optimistic that the treatment could make him feel better about himself and rid of all of his inner turmoil stemming from his childhood and his failed relationships. He had an estimated 100 sessions over several years. For a long time, Grant viewed the drug positively, and stated that it was the solution after many years of [...] "searching for his peace of mind", and that for {{first time in his life}} he was [...] "truly, deeply <b>and</b> <b>honestly</b> happy". Cannon claimed during a court hearing, in which she claimed he was an [...] "apostle of LSD", that he was still taking the drug in 1967 as part of a remedy to save their relationship. Grant later admitted that [...] "taking LSD was an utterly foolish thing to do but I was a self-opinionated boor, hiding all kinds of layers and defences, hypocrisy and vanity. I had to get rid of them and wipe the slate clean".|$|E
500|$|Britain {{agreed to}} negotiate, and a six-member {{commission}} convened in Washington in June 1887. [...] Bayard led the American delegation, joined by James Burrill Angell, {{president of the}} University of Michigan, and William LeBaron Putnam, a Maine lawyer and international law scholar. Joseph Chamberlain, a leading statesman in the British Parliament, led their delegation, which also included Lionel Sackville-West, the British ambassador to the United States, and Charles Tupper, a prominent politician from Nova Scotia. [...] By February 1888, the commission agreed on a new treaty, which would create a mixed commission to determine which bays were open to American fishermen. [...] Americans could purchase provisions and bait in Canada if they purchased a license, but if Canadian fisherman were allowed to sell their catch in the United States duty-free, then the Americans' licenses to fish in Canada would be free. [...] Bayard believed that the treaty, [...] "if observed honorably <b>and</b> <b>honestly,</b> will prevent future friction... between the two nations." [...] The Senate, controlled by Republicans, disagreed, and rejected the treaty by a 27–30 vote. [...] Aware of {{the risk that the}} treaty might be rejected, Bayard and Chamberlain agreed on a two-year working agreement, allowing Americans to continue their fishing in Canadian waters by paying a fee. This arrangement was renewed every two years until 1912, when a permanent solution was found.|$|E
