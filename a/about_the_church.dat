5|$|Bede {{also had}} correspondents who {{supplied}} him with material. Albinus, the abbot {{of the monastery}} in Canterbury, provided much information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> in Kent, and {{with the assistance of}} Nothhelm, at that time a priest in London, obtained copies of Gregory the Great's correspondence from Rome relating to Augustine's mission. Almost all of Bede's information regarding Augustine is taken from these letters. Bede acknowledged his correspondents in the preface to the Historia Ecclesiastica; he was in contact with Daniel, the Bishop of Winchester, for information {{about the history of the}} church in Wessex, and also wrote to the monastery at Lastingham for information about Cedd and Chad. Bede also mentions an Abbot Esi as a source for the affairs of the East Anglian church, and Bishop Cynibert for information about Lindsey.|$|E
5|$|But reform {{brought with}} it new ways of {{thinking}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> and its personnel, derived not only from contemporary continental movements {{but also from the}} rich pastoral and canonical literature of the Carolingian renaissance. This disseminated ideas concerning the separation of the lay and religious spheres, the distinction between monks and clergy, and enhanced the authority of bishops as both pastoral and political leaders. Ultimately, these ideas were to strike at deeply entrenched features of the early medieval church, such as hereditary control of churches and the right of the clergy to marry.|$|E
5|$|There are {{multiple}} {{stories of the}} birth of The Satanic Bible. In the introduction to the 2005–present edition, High Priest Peter H.

Gilmore lists {{a number of people who}} influenced LaVey's writings: Ayn Rand, Friedrich Nietzsche, H. L. Mencken, the members of the carnival with whom LaVey had supposedly worked in his youth, P.

5|$|Following {{the success}} of the 1973 film Metro-land, which {{documented}} life in suburban London, Edward Mirzoeff was commissioned to create a new documentary with John Betjeman. Mirzoeff noticed that aside from suburban themes, the Church of England was the other major influence on Betjeman's poetry. His proposal to the poet was for a study of the Church of England to be titled Failed in Divinity, a line derived from Betjeman's poetic autobiography Summoned by Bells, in which the poet relates how was sent down from the University of Oxford after failing a compulsory examination on divinity. In Mirzoeff's first treatment, Betjeman would have embarked on a journey around Britain studying fine cathedrals, churches and their congregations. Betjeman ruled against the title, but liked the idea, although he was keen that the film should be primarily <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> and its people, and not himself.|$|E
5|$|Iris Crowe is {{the older}} sister of Brother Justin and a devoted {{supporter}} of his ministry duties in California. Iris' {{significance in the}} series starts when Brother Justin informs her <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> board's plan to take away his new ministry. Shortly after, {{a fire in the}} church kills several orphans, but it remains unknown {{until the end of the}} first season that Iris was the arsonist. Radio show host Tommy Dolan, who arrived to help with the arson investigation, develops feelings for Iris, but a romance is hindered by Brother Justin's return from a week-long self-discovery trip. Dolan starts to uncover evidence pointing to Iris's guilt, but a strange twist at Iris's planned public confession results in Dolan's arrest as the culprit. To prevent the revelation of Brother Justin's true nature, Iris murders an innocent Okie, Eleanor. Late in the second season, Iris joins her foster father Norman in an ultimately unsuccessful plot against Brother Justin.|$|E
5|$|Scientology's space opera teachings were publicized in {{accounts}} {{given by}} former church members, most notably during court cases. One such case was filed {{by a former}} Scientologist, Larry Wollersheim, against the church in 1980. Five years later, Wollersheim offered confidential Scientology materials, including space opera teachings, to the court as evidence, a move that was vigorously protested by the church's attorneys. They were unable to prevent disclosure, however, and the documents were published by the Los Angeles Times in November 1985. This {{was the first time}} that some aspects of Scientology's space opera teachings were offered as public evidence <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>church.</b> In the mid-1990s, Wollersheim published some of the materials on a website, prompting the church to sue his organization, FACTNet. The Church attested that the space opera narratives were trade secrets; this claim was rejected by the court.|$|E

25|$|Independently of Stone, the Campbell {{wing of the}} {{movement}} was launched when Thomas Campbell published the Declaration and Address of the Christian Association of Washington, (Pennsylvania) in 1809.

On May 4, 1811, however, the Christian Association constituted itself as a congregationally governed church. With the building it then constructed at Brush Run, it became known as Brush Run Church.|$|E
