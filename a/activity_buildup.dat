We propose that both dynamics reflect two faces of the same recurrent loop mechanism: an integration device that accumulates ongoing stochastic activity and, either spontaneously or in a task-driven manner, crosses a dynamic threshold and ignites, leading to content-specific awareness. The hypothesis can explain a rich set of behavioral and neuronal phenomena, such as perceptual threshold, the high non-linearity of visual responses, the subliminal nature of spontaneous activity fluctuations, and the slow <b>activity</b> <b>buildup</b> anticipating spontaneous behavior (e. g., readiness potential). Further elaborations of this unified scheme, such as a cascade of integrators with different ignition thresholds or multi-stable states, can account for additional complexities in the repertoire of human cortical dynamics...|$|E

40|$|Avocado (Persea {{americana}} Mill. cv Hass) discs (3 mm thick) ripened {{in approximately}} 72 hours when maintained in {{a flow of}} moist air and resembled ripe fruit in texture and taste. Ethylene evolution by discs of early and midseason fruit was characterized by two distinct components, viz. wound ethylene, peaking at approximately 18 hours, and climacteric ethylene, rising to a peak at approximately 72 hours. A commensurate respiratory stimulation accompanied each ethylene peak. Aminoethoxyvinyl glycine (AVG) given consecutively, at once and at 24 hours following disc preparation, prevented wound and climacteric respiration peaks, virtually all ethylene production, and ripening. When AVG was administered for the first 24 hours only, respiratory stimulation and softening (ripening) were retarded by at least a day. When AVG was added solely after the first 24 hours, ripening proceeded as in untreated discs, although climacteric ethylene and respiration were diminished. Propylene given together with AVG led to ripening under all circumstances. 2, 5 -Norbornadiene given continuously stimulated wound ethylene production, and it inhibited climacteric ethylene evolution, the augmentation of ethylene-forming enzyme activity normally associated with climacteric ethylene, and ripening. 2, 5 -Norbornadiene given at 24 hours fully inhibited ripening. When intact fruit were pulsed with ethylene for 24 hours before discs were prepared therefrom, the respiration rate, ethylene-forming enzyme <b>activity</b> <b>buildup,</b> and rate of ethylene production were all subsequently enhanced. The evidence suggests that ethylene is involved in all phases of disc ripening.

No analyses have been performed to assess {{the consequences of the}} mutations identified, particularly for those variants that produce either full-length or nearly full-length proteins. In this study, the expression, stability, and activity of nine PH 3 human HOGA variants were examined.

To determine how HOG is cleaved in the absence of HOGA activity, the ability of N-acetylneuraminate aldolase (NAL) to cleave HOG was evaluated. NAL showed minimal activity towards HOG. Whether the expected buildup of HOG in mitochondria could inhibit glyoxylate reductase (GR), the enzyme mutated in PH 2, was also evaluated. GR was inhibited by HOG but not by 2 -hydroxyglutarate or 2 -oxoglutarate. Thus, one hypothetical component of the molecular basis for the excessive oxalate production in PH 3 appears to be the inhibition of GR by HOG, resulting in a phenotype similar to PH 2...|$|R

Furthermore, viability loss was measured during 4 h SSI. Prior to SSI, the diadino-diatoxanthin pool was increased in high irradiance acclimated cells, compared with cells grown under low irradiance. Thirty-minutes SSI caused a pronounced decline in PSII efficiency. This coincided with de-epoxidation of diadinoxanthin in high irradiance acclimated cells, which was completely reversed during recovery in low irradiance. De-epoxidation was lower for low irradiance acclimated cells. whereas PSII efficiency and carbohydrate buildup were lower during the recovery phase. Furthermore, clear UVR effects on PSII efficiency were observed in low irradiance but not in high irradiance acclimated cells. Although 30 min SSI did not increase cellular SOD activity and lipid peroxidation, prolonged (4 h) SSI caused viability loss in low irradiance acclimated cells, which was enhanced by UVR. Therefore, PAR and UVR-induced PSII inactivation and viability loss were reduced by high irradiance-mediated changes in light harvesting and the xanthophyll pigments.

40|$|The {{inhibitory}} drive {{arising from}} the basal ganglia is thought {{to prevent the occurrence}} of orienting movements of the eyes, head, and body in monkeys and other mammals. The direct projection from the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) to the superior colliculus (SC) mediates the inhibition. Since the original experiments in the SNr of monkeys the buildup or prelude neuron has been a focus of SC research. However, whether the SNr influences buildup neurons in SC is unknown. Furthermore, a contralateral SNr–SC pathway is evident in many species but remains unexplored in the alert monkey. Here we introduced electrical stimulation of one or both SNr nuclei while recording from SC buildup neurons. Stimulation of the SNr reduced the discharge rate of SC buildup neurons bilaterally. This result is consistent with activation of an inhibitory drive from SNr to SC. The time course of the influence of ipsilateral SNr on the activity of most SC neurons was longer (∼ 73 ms) than the influence of the contralateral SNr (∼ 34 ms). We also found that the variability of saccade onset time and saccade direction was altered with electrical stimulation of the SNr. Taken together our results show that electrical stimulation activates the inhibitory output of the SNr that in turn, reduces the <b>activity</b> of SC <b>buildup</b> neurons in both hemispheres. However, rather than acting as a gate for saccade initiation, the results suggest that the influence of SNr inhibition on visually guided saccades is more subtle, shaping the balance of excitation and inhibition across the SC...|$|R
40|$|The {{extinction}} {{of the central}} fixated stimulus before {{the appearance of a}} new target stimulus reduces the latency of saccades and pursuit, a phenomenon known as the “gap effect. ” The superior colliculus (SC) plays a prominent role in the gap effect for saccades, and recent data indicate that this structure also plays some role in the control of pursuit. We now show that the firing rate of buildup neurons in the rostral SC exhibits a gap effect during the initiation of both pursuit and saccadic eye movements to parafoveal targets. Most neurons exhibited an increase in tonic activity starting � 100 msec after the offset of the fixation spot, regardless of whether the target later appeared inside or outside of the response field of the neuron. The subsequent appearance of the target in the response field evoked phasic increases in activity that were approximately twice as large as the effects on tonic activity. For both pursuit and saccades, the levels of tonic and phasic activity were inversely correlated with latency on a trial-by-trial basis. These changes in activity provide a neuronal correlate for the shared effects on latency observed previously with the gap paradigm for pursuit and saccades. Finally, the phasic activity at pursuit onset exhibited a gap effect just like the target-evoked response, whereas the burst activity at saccade onset was fixed in amplitude. These results suggest how SC neurons may coordinate the initiation of pursuit and saccades: <b>buildup</b> <b>activity</b> may gate the initiation of pursuit, whereas it indirectly triggers saccades by recruiting a saccade-related burst.

This study is supplemented by τ-ratio maps as an efficient means to quantify the role of photoionization by pAGB stars, as compared to other mechanisms (e. g., AGN, low-level star formation). Additionally, we extend the tentative classification proposed in P 13 by the type i+, which is assigned to a subset of type i ETGs exhibiting ongoing low-level star-formation (SF) in their periphery. This finding along with faint traces of localized SF in the extranuclear component of several of our sample ETGs points to a non-negligible contribution by OB stars to the total ionizing budget. We also demonstrate that, at the typical emission-line detection threshold of 2 Å in previous studies, most of the extranuclear wim emission in an ETG may evade detection, which could in turn prompt its classification as an entirely gas-devoid system. This study adds further observational evidence for a considerable heterogeneity among ETGs with regard to the physical properties and 2 D kinematics of the wim component, and underscores the importance of IFS studies over their entire optical extent.

Understanding the dynamics of contemporary climate–fire relationships at national and sub-national scales is critical to assess the likelihood of changes in future fire activity and the potential options for mitigation and adaptation. Here, we conducted the first national assessment of climate controls on US fire activity using two satellite-based estimates of monthly burned area (BA), the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED, 1997 – 2010) and Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS, 1984 – 2009) BA products. For each US National Climate Assessment (NCA) region, we analyzed the relationships between monthly BA and potential evaporation (PE) derived from reanalysis climate data at 0. 5 &deg; resolution. US fire activity increased over the past 25 yr, with statistically significant increases in MTBS BA for the entire US and the Southeast and Southwest NCA regions. Monthly PE was strongly correlated with US fire activity, yet the climate driver of PE varied regionally. Fire season temperature and shortwave radiation were the primary controls on PE and fire activity in Alaska, while water deficit (precipitation – PE) was strongly correlated with fire activity in the Plains regions and Northwest US. BA and precipitation anomalies were negatively correlated in all regions, although fuel-limited ecosystems in the Southern Plains and Southwest exhibited positive correlations with longer lead times (6 – 12 months). Fire season PE increased from the 1980 's– 2000 's, enhancing climate-driven fire risk in the southern and western US where PE–BA correlations were strongest. Spatial and temporal patterns of increasing fire season PE and BA during the 1990 's– 2000 's highlight the potential sensitivity of US fire activity to climate change in coming decades. However, climate-fire relationships at the national scale are complex, based on the diversity of fire types, ecosystems, and ignition sources within each NCA region. Changes in the seasonality or magnitude of climate anomalies are therefore unlikely to result in uniform changes in US fire activity...|$|R

Confirming and strengthening our conclusions in Papaderos et al. (2013) we argue that ETGs span a broad continuous sequence {{with regard to the}} {{properties of}} their wim, and they can be roughly subdivided into two characteristic classes. The first one (type i) comprises ETGs with a nearly constant EW 1 - 3 Å in their extranuclear component, in quantitative agreement with (even though, no proof for) the hypothesis of photoionization by pAGB stars. The second class (type ii) consists of virtually wim-evacuated ETGs with a large Lyman continuum (Lyc) photon escape fraction and a very low (<= 0. 5 Å) EW in their nuclear zone. These two classes appear indistinguishable from one another by their LINER-specific emission-line ratios. Additionally, here we extend the classification by the class i+ which stands for a subset of type i ETGs with low-level star-fomation in contiguous spiral-arm like features in their outermost periphery. These faint features, together with traces of localized star formation in several type i&i+ systems point to a non-negligible contribution from young massive stars to the global ionizing photon budget in ETGs.

It is supplemented by tau-ratio maps, which are a more efficient means to quantify the role of photoionization by the post-AGB stellar component than alternative mechanisms (e. g., AGN, low-level star formation). Results. Confirming and strengthening our previous conclusions, we find that ETGs span a broad continuous sequence in the {{properties of}} their wim, exemplified by two characteristic classes. The first (type i) comprises systems with a nearly constant EW(H alpha) in their extranuclear component, which quantitatively agrees with (but is no proof of) the hypothesis that photoionization by the post-AGB stellar component is the main driver of extended wim emission. The second class (type ii) stands for virtually wim-evacuated ETGs with a very low (<= 0. 5 angstrom), outwardly increasing EW(H alpha). These two classes appear indistinguishable from one another by their LINER-specific emission-line ratios in their extranuclear component. Here we extend the tentative classification we proposed previously by the type i+, which is assigned to a subset of type i ETGs exhibiting ongoing low-level star-forming activity in their periphery. This finding along with faint traces of localized star formation in the extranuclear component of several of our sample galaxies points to a non-negligible contribution by OB stars to the global ionizing photon budget in ETGs. Additionally, our data again highlight the diversity of ETGs in their gaseous and stellar kinematics. While in one half of our sample, gas and stars show similar (yet not necessarily identical) velocity patterns that are both dominated by rotation along the major galaxy axis, our analysis also documents several cases of kinematical decoupling between gas and stars, or rotation along the minor galaxy axis. We point out that the generally very low (less than or similar to 1 angstrom) EW(H alpha) of ETGs requires a careful quantitative assessment of potential observational and analysis biases in studies of their wim. With standard emission-line fitting tools, Balmer emission lines become progressively difficult to detect below an EW(H alpha) similar to 3 angstrom, therefore our current understanding of the presence and 2 D emission patterns and kinematics of the diffuse wim ETGs may be severely incomplete. We demonstrate that at the typical emission-line detection threshold of similar to 2 angstrom in previous studies, most of the extranuclear wim emission in an ETG may evade detection, which could in turn cause ETGs to be classified as entirely gas-devoid systems. Conclusions. This study adds further observational evidence for a considerable heterogeneity among ETGs with regard to the physical properties and 2 D kinematics of their extended wim component, and it clearly shows that a comprehensive understanding of these systems requires IFS studies over their entire optical extent.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the project is measurements and computer simulations of independent and cumulative yields of residual product nuclei in thin targets relevant as target materials and structure materials for hybrid accelerator-driven systems coupled to high-energy proton accelerators. The yields of residual product nuclei are of great importance when estimating such basic radiation-technology characteristics of hybrid facility targets as the total target <b>activity,</b> target 'poisoning', <b>buildup</b> of long-lived nuclides that, in turn, are to be transmuted, product nuclide (Po) alpha-activity, content of low-pressure evaporated nuclides (Hg), content of chemically-active nuclides that spoil drastically the corrosion resistance of the facility structure materials, etc. In view of the above, radioactive product nuclide yields from targets and structure materials were determined by an experiment using the ITEP U- 10 proton accelerator in 51 irradiation runs for different thin targets: sup 1 sup 8 sup 2 sup, sup 1 sup 8 sup 3 sup, sup 1 sup 8 sup 4 sup, sup 1 sup 8 sup 6 W at proton energies 0. 2, 0. 8, and 1. 6 GeV; sup n sup a sup t W, sup 5 sup 6 Fe, sup 5 sup 8 Ni, and sup 9 sup 3 Nb at 2, 6 GeV; sup 2 sup 3 sup 2 Th, sup n sup a sup t U, at 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 8, and 1. 6 GeV; sup 9 sup 9 Tc, at 0. 1, 0. 15, 0. 2, 0. 8, 1. 0, 1. 2, 1. 4, 1. 6, and 2. 6 GeV; sup 5 sup 9 Co and sup 6 sup 3 sup, sup 6 sup 5 Cu at 0. 2, 1. 2, 1. 6, and 2. 6 GeV; sup n sup a sup t Hg at 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 8, and 2. 6 GeV and, additionally, sup 2 sup 0 sup 8 Pb at 1. 0 GeV. As a result, 4315 cumulative and independent yields of residual radioactive product nuclei, whose lifetimes range from 8 minutes to 32 years, have been measured. Besides, the monitor sup 2 sup 7 Al(p,x) sup 2 sup 4 Na and sup 2 sup 7 Al(p,x) sup 7 Be reaction cross sections have been measured at proton energies from 0. 07 GeV to 2. 6 GeV. The experimental nuclide yields were determined by the direct gamma-spectrometry method. The gamma-spectrometer res 1. 8 at the 1332 keV gamma-line. The experimental gamma-spectra were processed by the GENIE 2000 code. The gamma-lines were identified, and the cross sections calculated, by the ITEP-developed SIGMA code using the PCNUDAT database. The proton fluence was monitored by the sup 2 sup 7 Al(p,x) sup 2 sup 2 Na reaction. Some of {{the results have been}} compared with the data obtained elsewhere, in particular with the recent GSI inverse kinematics experiments. The measured data are compared with the simulations by the LAHET, CEM 95, CEM 2 k, LAQGSM, CASCADE, CASCADE/INPE, YIELDX, HETC, and INUCL codes. The predictive power of the tested codes is different but was found to be satisfactory for most of the nuclides in the spallation region, though none of the benchmarked codes agree well with the data in the whole mass region of product nuclides and all should be improved further. On the whole, the predictive power of all codes for the data in the fission product region is worse than in the spallation region; therefore, development of better models for fission-fragment formation is of first priority...|$|R
