5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the 19th century, {{architecture}} {{developed into}} the late Baroque style. Among the major proponents were Johan Conrad Ernst who built the Chancery Building or Kancellibygningen (1721) on Slotsholmen and Lauritz de Thurah who designed the Eremitage Palace (1734) in Dyrehaven, just north of Copenhagen. Even more ambitious was de Thurah's work at Ledreborg near Roskilde, where he succeeded in working the components into a well-balanced and cohesive Baroque palace.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{problem of}} {{the examination of the}} parameters of cutting process on the micro-geometric and macro-geometric parameters <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> <b>of</b> composite material with natural reinforcement (material is combination of two different phases – the plastic matrix and wood flour). The article deals with effect of feed rate and cutting speed to roundness deviation and maximum roughness depth. The results were analysed using device of surface roughness, roundness/cylindricity and digital microscopic camera. From the result, the surface roughness is mostly influenced by feed rate...|$|R

5|$|In {{the last}} years of the ninth century, three sub-ealdormen ruled Mercia under Æthelred. Æthelflæd's uncle, Æthelwulf, {{controlled}} western and possibly central Mercia, while the south and east were ruled by Æthelfrith, the father of Æthelstan Half-King. Alhhelm was responsible for the lands bordering the northern Danelaw. Æthelwulf and Alhhelm are not recorded <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the century, and Æthelfrith may have been Æthelflæd's chief lieutenant when Æthelred's health collapsed soon afterwards. Keynes sees Æthelfrith as an ealdorman of West Saxon origin, probably appointed by Alfred to look after his interests in south-east Mercia.|$|E
5|$|Tegetthoff {{was laid}} down in 1876 at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino {{shipyard}} in Trieste. The ship was launched in 1878, and completed in 1881. She conducted her sea trials in October of that year, and was finally ready for commissioning in September 1882; Kaiser Franz Joseph attended the commissioning of the ship in Pola. Financial difficulties had again delayed the ship's completion; the parliament finally voted to allocate funds to finish the ship in November 1881. At the time, she was {{the largest and most}} powerful ship in the Austro-Hungarian fleet, and she would keep that distinction until <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the century. She was, nevertheless, a political compromise, and was much smaller than foreign casemate ships, particularly British and French vessels.|$|E

In 1961, it reached the quarter-finals of the European Cup, where the club lost to Benfica (1-4 home and 1-3 away). In 1989, AGF again reached a European quarter-final, this time losing to Barcelona in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup (0-1 home, 0-0 away). <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> millennium, AGF {{experienced}} some poor results {{which has led to}} relegation from the Danish Superliga in 2005-06, 2009-10 and in 2013-14, each time though securing a quick return to the top-flight.|$|R
50|$|After an {{offensive}} action urged by Cho {{led to a}} near massacre of the attacking Japanese troops by superior American firepower, Ushijima adopted the defensive attrition tactics urged by Yahara. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shuri Line by the American forces, he led a successful withdrawal of his troops to the extreme south of the island. This defensive line did not meet with the same success, and became a fragmented grouping of isolated defensive positions. Ushijima and Cho retreated to Hill 89 at the south coast. The command {{and control of the}} remnants of the 32nd Army soon quickly deteriorated as communication with the last defensive positions was cut. Record numbers of Japanese prisoners surrendered; many were Okinawan volunteers or conscripts.|$|R

5|$|The {{early years}} of the Representatives' Centralization of Germany were {{dominated}} by a discussion on how to finance strikes by individual local trade unions. The issue was how local unions could retain their autonomy when receiving financial assistance. Originally, all support between local organizations had been voluntary. But this system became more and more impractical, especially <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century saw numerous large strikes in which employers reacted more aggressively— often by locking out workers. In 1899, the Business Committee felt it had to support a strike in Braunschweig. It took out a loan, which was paid off with dues income and from donations by Berlin unions. The following year, the Business Committee incurred 8,000 Marks in debt by supporting strikes. Part of the debt was paid off by the SPD, while the rest was apportioned among the local unions.|$|E
5|$|With the {{takeover}} of two French name brands, HOM and Valisère, Triumph International ventured into the men's underwear and high-quality lingerie market. At the same time, the company announced in 1995 {{that in the future}} it would focus more on its Triumph umbrella brand, under which a number of brands would be classified. To that end, an advertising campaign was launched featuring Naomi Campbell and Helena Christensen. In the 1990s, Triumph International launched another phase of international expansion, and since 1998 it has been present on the subcontinent of India. In 2001, its newest production facility opened in Dunaújváros (Hungary). <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the millennium, Triumph {{was one of the biggest}} textile manufacturers in terms of sales in the domestic market.|$|E
5|$|Since the university's {{establishment}} {{in the city}} in 1837, the histories of the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor have been closely linked. The town became a regional transportation hub in 1839 {{with the arrival of}} the Michigan Central Railroad, and a north—south railway connecting Ann Arbor to Toledo and other markets to the south was established in 1878. Throughout the 1840s and the 1850s settlers continued to come to Ann Arbor. While the earlier settlers were primarily of British ancestry, the newer settlers also consisted of Germans, Irish, and African-Americans. In 1851, Ann Arbor was chartered as a city, though the city showed a drop in population during the Depression of 1873. It was not until the early 1880s that Ann Arbor again saw robust growth, with new immigrants coming from Greece, Italy, Russia, and Poland. Ann Arbor saw increased growth in manufacturing, particularly in milling. Ann Arbor's Jewish community also grew <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century, and its first and oldest synagogue, Beth Israel Congregation, was established in 1916.|$|E

40|$|The changes {{produced}} on metallic surfaces {{as a result}} of grinding and polishing are not as yet fully understood. Undoubtedly there is some more or less marked change in the crystal structure, at least, in the top layer. Hereby a diffusion of separated crystal particles may be involved, or, on plastic material, the formation of a layer in greatly deformed state, with possible recrystallization in certain conditions. Czochralski verified the existence of such a layer on tin micro-sections by successive observations of <b>the</b> texture <b>after</b> repeated etching; while Thomassen established, roentgenographically by means of the Debye-Scherrer method, the existence of diffused crystal fractions on the surface of ground and polished tin bars, which he had already observed <b>after</b> <b>turning</b> (on <b>the</b> lathe). (Thickness of this layer - 0. 07 mm). Whether this layer borders direct on the undamaged base material or whether deformed intermediate layers form the transition, nothing is known.

All {{three members of the}} class remained in the navy's inventory through World War I; Italy seized Kaiser Max and Vulkan, though both were awarded to the Royal Yugoslav Navy in the postwar peace negotiations. Italy refused to relinquish Vulkan, the fate of which is unknown, but Kaiser Max was transferred to Yugoslavia and renamed Tivat. The ship was either scrapped in 1924, or kept in the Yugoslav inventory until the country was overrun in the Axis invasion during World War II, her fate after falling back into Italian hands unknown. Don Juan d'Austria, meanwhile, sank under uncertain circumstances in 1919 before she could be seized by the victorious Allied powers.|$|E
