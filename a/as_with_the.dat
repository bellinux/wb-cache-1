5|$|Although a clear {{relative}} to the common hippopotamus, H. lemerlei was much smaller, {{roughly the size of}} the modern pygmy hippopotamus. The largest specimens were 6.5ft (2 m) long and 2.5ft (0.7 m) tall. The ancestors of H. lemerlei may have been full-sized hippos who shrunk through the process of insular dwarfism. A similar dwarfing process has occurred with hippos in many Mediterranean islands such <b>as</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Cretan dwarf hippopotamus or the Cyprus dwarf hippopotamus.|$|E
5|$|Another notable {{feature of}} Tolkien's Elvish {{languages}} was his {{development of a}} complex internal history of characters to speak those tongues in their own fictional universe. He felt that his languages changed and developed over time, <b>as</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> historical languages which he studied professionally—not in a vacuum, {{but as a result}} of the migrations and interactions of the peoples who spoke them.|$|E
5|$|As indicated, hospice is {{frequently}} under-utilized and often not {{taken advantage of}} until very late in a patient's illness.

A 2009 study found that with proper case management hospice access could be liberalized without additional costs to insurers.|$|E

5|$|As {{with most}} of the {{principles}} adopted by the League, the Minorities Treaties were a part of the Wilsonian idealist approach to international relations, and <b>as</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> League itself, the Minority Treaties were increasingly ignored by the respective governments, with the entire system mostly collapsing in the late 1930s. Despite the political failure they remained the basis of international law. After World War II the legal principles were incorporated in the UN Charter and a host of international human rights treaties.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Household Cavalry, the {{officers}} of the Royals and Inniskillings found {{it very difficult to}} rein back their troops, who lost all cohesion.

Their horses were blown, and they were still in disorder without any idea of what their next collective objective was. Some attacked nearby gun batteries of the Grande Battery.|$|E
