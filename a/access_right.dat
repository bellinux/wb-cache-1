40|$|Success {{and costs}} of audits in {{identity}} management largely depend {{on the structure of}} the underlying access control model. Auditing <b>access</b> <b>rights</b> includes the determination of actuality and adequacy of provided <b>access</b> <b>rights.</b> In order to case audit and administration of <b>access</b> <b>rights,</b> role mining approaches have provided several solutions for identifying a minimal set of roles based upon either existing usage data, or business data.

40|$|Abstract — In {{database}} {{systems that}} support fine-grained access controls, each user has <b>access</b> <b>rights</b> that determine which tuples are accessible {{and which are}} inaccessible. Queries are answered as if the inaccessible tuples are not present in the database. Thus, users with different <b>access</b> <b>rights</b> may get different answers to a given query. To process queries efficiently {{in the presence of}} fine-grained access controls, the database system needs accurate {{estimates of the number of}} tuples that are both accessible according to the <b>access</b> <b>rights</b> of the submitting user and relevant according to the selection predicates in the query. In this paper, we present PSALM, a sampling-based cardinality estimation technique for use in the presence of fine-grained access controls. Our technique exploits the fact that <b>access</b> <b>rights</b> are relatively static and are common to all queries that are evaluated on behalf of a particular user.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} memory {{addressing}} environments {{that support the}} notion of a single address space. We consider the problem of hampering access attempts to the private objects of a given thread, when these attempts are generated by unauthorized threads of different processes. We introduce two different forms of access privilege representation - handles and gates - which are designed to coexist within the boundaries of the same protection system. The handle concept is a generalization of the classical protected pointer concept. A handle associates several keys (passwords) with an object name. Each key grants a specific <b>access</b> <b>right</b> to the named object. A gate is a compact representation of access privileges, which uses a single bit to encode an <b>access</b> <b>right.</b> Handles are protected from forgery by key sparseness. They can be freely mixed in memory with ordinary data. On the other hand, gates are sensitive data that must be kept segregated in private memory regions of the protection system. The dualism of handles and gates makes it possible {{to take advantage of the}} simplicity of <b>access</b> <b>right</b> distribution and object sharing between threads, which is characteristic of key-based protection systems, and to avoid the negative impact on overall system performance, which results from the large key size and the high costs of lengthy processing that are connected with key validation...|$|E

As a fact, exploiting most of vulnerabilities result in access rights alteration. In this paper, we propose a new vulnerability analysis method based on the Take-Grant protection model. We extend the initial Take-Grant model to address the notion of vulnerabilities and introduce the vulnerabilities rewriting rules to specify how the protection state of the system can be changed by exploiting vulnerabilities. Our analysis {{is based on a}} bounded polynomial algorithm, which generates the closure of the Take-Grant graph regarding vulnerabilities. The closure helps to verify whether any subject can obtain an <b>access</b> <b>right</b> over an object. The application of our results have been examined in a case study which reveals how an attacker can gain an unauthorized <b>access</b> <b>right</b> by exploiting chain of vulnerabilities. ...|$|E
