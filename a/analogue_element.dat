The HomolD-binding protein Rrn 7 forms a complex with the RNA polymeraseII machinery. Despite {{the importance of}} ribosome biogenesis to cell survival, the mechanisms involved in the regulation of transcription of eukaryotic RPGs are unknown. In this study, we identified Rrn 7 as a new substrate of the pleiotropic casein kinase 2 (CK 2), which is a regulator of basal transcription. Recombinant Rrn 7 from S. pombe, which is often used as a model organism for studying eukaryotic transcription, interacted with CK 2 invitro and invivo. Furthermore, CK 2 -mediated phosphorylation of Rrn 7 inhibited its HomolD-directed transcriptional activity and ability to bind to an oligonucleotide containing a HomolD box invitro. Mutation of Rrn 7 at Thr 67 abolished these effects, indicating that this residue is a critical CK 2 phosphorylation site. Finally, Rrn 7 interacted with the regulatory subunit of CK 2 invivo, inhibition of CK 2 invivo potentiated ribosomal protein gene transcription, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses identified that the catalytic subunit of CK 2 {{was associated with the}} rpk 5 gene promoter in S. pombe. Taken together, these data suggest that CK 2 inhibits ribosomal protein gene transcription in S. pombe via phosphorylation of Rrn 7 at Thr 67. FONDECYT 112050...|$|E

30|$|Colloids {{and their}} {{association}} with <b>analogue</b> <b>elements,</b> uranium, and rare earth elements (REEs), in deep granitic groundwater were investigated at the Mizunami Underground Research Laboratory (MIU). Groundwater was sampled from underground boreholes and gallery walls, and the colloids were separated by size-fractionated ultrafiltration (pore sizes, 0.2  μm, 10  kDa, and 1  kDa). For the groundwater sampled from fractures in excavation walls, the size-fractionated concentrations of the colloid-forming elements were approximately constant relative to different size fractions (0.2  μm, 200  kDa, 50  kDa, and 10  kDa). The contamination of Fe- and Al-bearing materials was insignificant in the filtered groundwater from fracture seepages. Changes in the concentrations of U in the groundwater sampled from boreholes and excavation walls {{were associated with the}} Al-bearing colloids, Fe-bearing colloids, and organic matter. The REE-bearing material(s) that were > 0.2  μm in size were mobile in the deep granitic groundwater, rather than occurring in association with Al-bearing, Fe-bearing colloids, and organic matter. It is suggested that sampling from water-conducting fractures in host rock and colloid elimination in borehole are important components of water quality control in geochemical investigations.|$|R

5000|$|An MWA antenna {{comprises}} {{four by four}} regular grid of dual-polarisation dipole elements {{arranged on}} a 4m x 4m steel mesh ground plane. Each antenna (with its 16 dipoles) {{is known as a}} [...] "tile". Signals from each dipole pass through a low noise amplifier (LNA) and are combined in an analogue beamformer to produce tile beams on the sky. Beamformers sit next to the tiles in the field. The radio frequency (RF) signals for the tile-beams are transmitted to a receiver, each receiver being able to process the signals from a group of eight tiles. Receivers therefore sit in the field, close to groups of eight tiles; cables between receivers and beamformers carry data, power and control signals. Power for the receivers is provided from a central generator. The receiver contains <b>analogue</b> <b>elements</b> to condition the signals in preparation for sampling and digitisation. The frequency range 80-300 MHz is Nyquist-sampled at high precision. Digital elements in the receiver (after the digitiser) are used to transform the time-series data to the frequency domain with a 1.28 MHz resolution - 5 bits real and 5 bits imaginary for each resolution element. Sets of 1.28 MHz coarse frequency channels are transmitted via an optical fibre connection to the correlator subsystem, located in the CSIRO Data Processing Facility near the MWA site. MWA shares the CSIRO facility with the ASKAP program.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I will discuss some {{techniques}} that I {{use as an}} artist to instill curiosity. The criteria for my ‘discourse’ are set out by Stephen Bann in his book “Ways around Modernism” (Stephen Bann, 2006) wherein he formulates an “ambitious brief for the present-day artist in respect to curiosity”. I will elaborate on this brief with references to my own work, and show how a media-archeological mindset, facilitated by {{a strong interest in}} and linkeage between art and science, can be an important source of inspiration for an artist. Being a media artist, I try to expand the code of the video apparatus by subverting parameters of the medium. One media-archeology based technique that I employ is re-injecting <b>analogue</b> <b>elements</b> into this highly digital apparatus. The technique of anamorphosis is one such analogue form of mediation that I employ in my PhD research: using multiple catoptrical anamorphoses with multiple optical (analogue) ‘lenses’ as mediators between the digital apparatus and the observer. This approach touches the core of my PhD research wherein I explore how interventions on a number of parameters of the video apparatus can generate a sense of wonder and curiosity with the observer, in search of a contemporary iteration of the concept ‘cinema of attractions’ (Tom Gunning, 1990). ‘Cinema of attractions’ being an everpresent undercurrent surging to the surface whenever the fascination for and the explicitation of the medium takes the lead. It is clear that this stress on curiosity as part of an artist’s brief also has an impact on research methodologies being used: research through design could in this context easily be rephrased as research through curiosity. status: accepte...|$|R

40|$|Existing shock sensors for car {{protection}} {{using the}} sensitive elements (SE) of piezoelectric, microphone and electromagnetic types and the analogue circuitry of signal processing, {{have a number}} of essential shortcomings: - piezoelectric sensitive elements have no characteristics repeatability that complicates their use in mass production; - microphone sensors are structurally complicated and demand difficult information signal processing; - sensitive elements of electromagnetic sensors demand individual control (a specified clearance to be set between a magnet and the coil). Use of <b>analogue</b> <b>elements</b> (resistors, capacitors) in the amplifier and filter circuits reduces temporary and temperature stability of characteristics. An adjustment of the sensor operating zones via variable resistors on a printed circuit is extremely inconvenient and doesn't allow to change quickly the sensor sensitivity depending on an external situation (for example, to increase quickly an operating zone of the sensor with an alarm system of a key fob when securing a car in the country or in the woods, or to reduce it in the street with heavy traffic streams). An analogue circuit–based sensor design disables its automatic adaptation to such external impacts as a rain, a stream passing by cars, etc. The article considers how to solve some of above problems while designing the two-zone digital shock sensors with a SE of electromagnetic type. It shows the SE design developed by the authors as a module containing the coil and a magnet, secured on the coil axis in a silicone extension. The circuitry solution and algorithms of signals processing allowed authors to realize a remote control of the prevention and alarm zones (with 16 gradation of sensitivity). The algorithm of self-adaptation to the repeating external impacts is proposed. The developed method to form the basic levels of digital comparators for each gradation of sensitivity enables the sensor to have the straight-line adjusting characteristic. The developed shock sensor is implemented as stock-produced items included in the car alarm systems of the trademark “Excellent” (made by JSC Magic Ring Ltd.). Operating experience (about 40 thousand pieces realized now) allows a proper adjustment of sensors to be possible on cars with any body type. A sufficient level of the sensor sensitivity proves it. The reliability of sensors is confirmed by failures statistics in use (0, 08 %). Failures are, usually, caused by the SE coil wire break in a soldering point of the coil leads to the printed circuit. However a number of shortcomings are also revealed. Experimental data processing of a test batch of sensors has shown that existing SE of electromagnetic type have the frequency of free vibrations f  80  5 Hz and a decay constant of transient under shock   0, 2 s. At these parameters a SE pass-band makes only f  1, 5 Hz, and the sensor responses only to the shock front, rather than to the secondary vibrations of a body. It is an essential drawback of the narrow-band sensors. The experiments conducted on test batch of sensors (10 samples) have shown essentially different sensitivities of sensors under shock {{in the direction of the}} sensitivity axis and perpendicular to it. This difference reaches 4 - 6 gradations of sensitivity. It means that when mounting a sensor on the particular car the orientation of sensitivity axis of the sensor will be of crucial importance that is also a shortcoming. It is shown that overcoming the specified drawbacks is hardly because of the improvement of sensitive elements suspension of electromagnetic sensors. Three-axial accelerometers implemented using MEMS technologies seem to be the most perspective application here. </p...|$|R

40|$|Interest in poly(diorgano) silanes, catenated silicon {{compounds}} and heavier <b>element</b> <b>analogues</b> of alkanes has derived largely from their 1 -dimensional delocalisation across the Si-Si sigma framework, which affords similar properties observed for polyene and unsaturated "all organic" polymers. Although not so widely recognised or studied, similar "sigma-delocalised" activity {{may also be}} observed for homocatenated species of other p-block elements. In this study, a foundation for {{an understanding of the}} phenomenon of sigma-delocalisation is provided through consideration of the structures, methods of synthesis and electronic behaviour of the well-established poly(diorgano) silanes. Synthetic and theoretical developments relating to analogous derivatives based upon silicon's heavier group 14 congeners are then reviewed along with the more limited examples of catenated compounds among the heavier elements of groups 15 and 13. This coverage does not dwell upon detailed aspects of structure or electronic behaviour for the individual {{compounds and}} classes of compound included. Rather, the intention is to promote something of a phenomenological awareness of a series of superficially disparate chemical systems and to encourage a more widespread appreciation of the implication that, in not displaying sigma-delocalisation, it is the elements of the first full period that display the more unusual or anomalous behaviour...|$|R
