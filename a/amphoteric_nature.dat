The vacancy clusters, involving 3 - 4 Zn vacancies, trap and deactivate Li, leaving other in-grown donors to determine the electrical properties. Such clusters are not present in sufficient concentrations after longer (1 h) anneals because of a relatively low dissociation barrier ∼ 2. 6 ± 0. 3 eV, so ZnO remains compensated until Li diffuses out after 1250 °C anneals.

The highest phosphate adsorption capacity was obtained by using Zn-Al- 2 - 300, that is LDHs with Zn/Al molar ratio of 2 and calcined at 300 degrees C for 4 h. Circumneutral and mildly alkaline waters appeared suitable for the possible application of Zn-Al LDHs due to the <b>amphoteric</b> <b>nature</b> of aluminum hydroxide. Phosphate adsorption from the sludge filtrate by the LDHs followed pseudo-second-order kinetics, and the adsorption capacity at equilibrium was determined to be similar to 50 mg P/g.

Utilizing femtosecond-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, we tracked the trajectories of excited-state proton transfer and discovered that proton hopping along the water wire accomplishes the reaction more efficiently compared to the transfer occurring with bulk water clusters. Our finding suggests that the directionality of the proton movements along the charge-gradient H-bond network may be a key element for long-distance proton translocation in biological systems, as the H-bond networks wiring acidic and basic sites distal to each other can provide a shortcut for a proton in searching a global minimum on a complex energy landscape to its destination. close 8...|$|E

This paper is restricted in its scope to the staining of bacterial protoplasm by common basic and acid dyes. Perhaps the most widely accepted theory of bacterial staining was presented by Stearn and Stearn (1929, 1930), who showed that acid dyes stain bacterial cells best under acid conditions and basic dyes stain best under basic conditions.

It is now well established that when amorphous silicon is illuminated the density of dangling bond states increases. Dangling bond states produce amphoteric electronic mid-gap states which act as efficient charge trapping and recombination centres. The increase in dangling bond states causes {{a decrease in the}} performance of amorphous silicon solar cells. To show this effect, a modelling approach has been developed which uses the density of localised states with exponentially increasing band-tails and dangling bond defect states distribution chosen according to the defect pool model. The calculation of the evolution of dangling bond state density during illumination has been achieved through a dynamic scaling relation derived from a defect creation model. The approach considers the <b>amphoteric</b> <b>nature</b> of the dangling bond state and thus accounts for the contributions of the different charge states of the dangling bond during the degradation process.

The values of the Freundlich K constant of the adsorption isotherms and the distribution coefficients, Kd, depend on the pH of the adsorption system and vary between 55. 54 - 9603 (K) and 36. 82 - 6252 (Kd) for HT and between 10, 106 - 23, 242 (K) and 17, 801 - 26, 558 (Kd) for HT 500. X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy studies howed that glyphosate is not adsorbed into the interlayer of HT. The adsorption mechanisms are (1) electrostatic attraction between the surface of HT, charged positively below pH 12 according to its point of zero charge and the glyphosate anion, and (2) ligand exchange between the P-OH and/or C=O groups of the herbicide and the A 1 and Mg atoms of the HT surface. The occurrence of one or both mechanisms depends on the pH of the adsorption system.

The resulting bio-composites showed an increase in flexural properties and interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) compared to composites produced using untreated jute fibres. To understand the reason behind the ILSS improvement, the acid&# 8211;base properties of jute fibres were determined by contact angle analysis using the capillary rise method. The results were fitted further to van Oss-Chaudhury-Good (vOCG) and Chang-Qin-Chen (CQC) models to determine the Lifshitz-van der Waals (LW) and acid-base components of surface energy. Surface energy determined by the vOCG model revealed that plasma treatment of jute fibre resulted in a 22 % increase in total surface energy, a 19 % increase in the LW component and a 24 % increase in the acid-base component of surface energy. The increase in the acid-base component {{is due to the}} significant increase (69 %) in the electron-accepting (&# 0947;+S) parameter.

The <b>amphoteric</b> <b>nature</b> of these compounds allows their electrospray detection in both positive and negative ionisation.

For those materials prepared following the donor-type nominal Ba(1 -x) Er(x) (Ti(0. 85) Zr(0. 15)) O(3) composition, especially, Er(3 +) however showed a preferential substitution for the (Ti,Zr) (4 +) lattice sites. This allowed synthesis of a finally acceptor-like, highly resistive Ba(Ti,Zr,Er) O(3 -delta) -like system, with a solubility limit below but close to 3 cat. % Er(3 +). The overall phase development is {{discussed in terms of}} the <b>amphoteric</b> <b>nature</b> of Er(3 +), and appears to mainly or, at least, partially also involve a minimization of stress effects from the ion size mismatch between the dopant and host cations. Further results presented here include a comparative analysis of the behavior of the materials` grain size, electrical properties and nature of the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition upon variation of the formulation and Er(3 +) content.
