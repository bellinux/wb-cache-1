50|$|Remiz is a genus {{of birds}} in the Remizidae family, {{commonly}} known as the Eurasian pendulines (in contrast to the <b>African</b> <b>pendulines).</b> Like other <b>penduline</b> <b>tits,</b> they are named for their elegant, pendulous nests. The genus name, Remiz, is the Polish word for the Eurasian <b>penduline</b> <b>tit.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Eurasian <b>penduline</b> <b>tit</b> or European <b>penduline</b> <b>tit</b> (Remiz pendulinus) is a {{passerine}} bird of {{the genus}} Remiz. The genus name is the Polish word for the Eurasian <b>penduline</b> <b>tit,</b> and pendulinus is Latin for [...] "hanging down".|$|R
50|$|The Cape <b>penduline</b> <b>tit</b> or {{southern}} <b>penduline</b> <b>tit</b> (Anthoscopus minutus) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Remizidae.It is found in Angola, Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe.Its natural habitats are dry savannah, subtropical or tropical dry shrubland, and Mediterranean-type shrubby vegetation. At 8 cm in length, {{it is one of}} the smallest species of bird found in Africa, along with its cousins the grey <b>penduline</b> <b>tit</b> and the mouse-coloured <b>penduline</b> <b>tit.</b>|$|R
50|$|Several {{species of}} <b>penduline</b> <b>tit</b> are migratory, {{although}} this behaviour is only shown in species found in Asia and Europe; African species and the verdin are apparently sedentary. The Eurasian <b>penduline</b> <b>tit</b> is migratory over parts of its range, with birds in northern Europe moving {{south in the}} winter but birds in southern Europe remaining close to their breeding areas. In contrast the Chinese <b>penduline</b> <b>tit</b> is fully migratory and undertake long distance migrations.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{far-reaching}} impacts of sexual conflict over care on {{a suite of}} traits in the <b>penduline</b> <b>tit</b> family (Remizidae), further confirming the intricate relationships between parental care, mating systems and sexual selection. The results reveal the first genetic phylogeny of this family and suggest that uniparental care evolved once in this group. The transition to uniparental care is associated with rapid evolution of male plumage ornaments most likely driven by increased sexual selection. The results also suggest a relationship between male care {{and the likelihood of}} paternity on an evolutionary time-scale, as the biparental species exhibit much lower levels of promiscuity than the uniparental European <b>penduline</b> <b>tit.</b> Increased promiscuity was also found to impact sperm morphology in the <b>penduline</b> <b>tits</b> and allies with greater sperm length uniformity in more promiscuous species. This sperm trait was also discovered to co-vary with a sexually selected plumage trait in the European <b>penduline</b> <b>tit</b> suggesting potential interactions between female mate choice and male fertility. An investigation into genetic diversity within the Sylvioidea super-family finds large variation but does not suggest any link between promiscuity and genetic diversity as predicted if promiscuity maintains a higher effective population size in these passerines. The work highlights the interlinked relationships between parental care, mating systems and sexually selected traits, which are increasingly studied in concert. The consequences of sexual conflict over care appear to be far-reaching in the <b>penduline</b> <b>tits,</b> however {{the degree to which they}} feedback upon each other and the effect that it has on speciation remains to be seen. The <b>penduline</b> <b>tits</b> further prove their ability to provide valuable insight into the evolution of sexual conflict...|$|R

5000|$|The verdin {{builds a}} domed nest out of thorny twigs. In some <b>penduline</b> <b>tit</b> species {{the eggs are}} white, {{sometimes}} with red spots. The verdin lays blue-green eggs with red spots. Incubation lasts about 13 or 14 days, and the nestlings fledge at about 18 days (Perrins 2003). In <b>penduline</b> <b>tits,</b> higher incidences of extra-pair paternity results in lower rates of male care, suggesting that extra-pair offspring devalues parental care.|$|R

40|$|AbstractPresently, {{there are}} several nesting groups of the Chinese <b>penduline</b> <b>tit</b> in Primorsky Krai. In Russia, the first nest of the Chinese <b>penduline</b> <b>tit</b> was found in 1994 in the Hasansky region of Primorsky Krai near the border with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The nest was from the {{previous}} year, which indicates that the nesting has already occurred in 1993. From 1998 to 1999, {{the population in the}} Hasansky area totalled 20 â€“ 25 pairs. Further, there was {{an increase in the number}} and a northward advancement along the seacoast. Currently, the number is estimated to be between 400 and 450 pairs. On the coast of Lake Khanka, the Chinese <b>penduline</b> <b>tit</b> was noticed for the first time in 2000. In 2002, there were 35 pairs, and the currently estimate is between 100 and 150 pairs. From 2012 to 2014, some pairs began to nest in two sites near Ussuriisk. Wintering and nomadic individuals have been encountered in other regions of Primorsky Krai. It is assumed that the Chinese <b>penduline</b> <b>tit</b> appeared in the territory of Primorye sometime from the end of 1980 s to the beginning of the 1990 s.

40|$|To {{describe}} the exceptional mating {{system of the}} <b>penduline</b> <b>tit,</b> Remiz pendulinus, we aim to combine field observation records with DNA analysis based on polymorphic microsatellite DNA markers. Here we describe features of nine loci and their corresponding polymerase chain reaction primers. The observed number of alleles varied from four to seven and the observed heterozygosity ranged from 0. 419 to 0. 802. Neither of the loci is sex-linked and as linkage disequilibrium analysis showed they assort independently. Seven of the nine loci were polymorphic in the Cape <b>penduline</b> <b>tit,</b> Anthoscopus minutus. ...|$|R
5000|$|In the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy, the Paridae {{family is}} much {{enlarged}} to include related {{groups such as}} the <b>penduline</b> <b>tits</b> and long-tailed tits, but while the former are quite close to the titmice indeed and could conceivably be included in that family together with the stenostirid [...] "warblers", the long-tailed tits are not. Indeed, the yellow-browed tit and the sultan tit are possibly more distant to the <b>tits</b> than the <b>penduline</b> <b>tits</b> are.

40|$|Vasopressin {{influences}} {{social behaviour}} in mammals, in particular social recognition and bonding. However, much less {{is known about}} its avian analogue, vasotocin, although vasotocin appears to modulate singing behaviour and agonistic interactions together with vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) in some songbirds. The objectives of our study were to compare the expression of vasotocin and VIP in brain nuclei hypothetised {{to be part of}} the social behavioural network, i. e. septal areas, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and medial preoptic nucleus (POM), in two songbird species in the wild: the blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) and European <b>penduline</b> <b>tit</b> (Remiz pendulinus). These two closely related passerine birds differ in their pair bonding and mating systems: blue tits are socially monogamous with extensive pair bond lasting for several months, whereas in the European <b>penduline</b> <b>tit,</b> pair bond is short and it dissolves during or after laying of the eggs. The two species did not differ in the distribution of vasotocin in the observed brain regions; however, VIP was more abundant in all three regions of <b>penduline</b> <b>tits</b> than in blue tits. We found a sex difference in favour of males in the distribution of vasotocin-and VIP-immunoreactive neurones, fibres and terminals in all three regions in <b>penduline</b> <b>tits.</b> In blue tits, such gender differences were only observed in the POM. The limited differences between the two species suggest that the levels of vasotocin and VIP in the socially relevant brain regions are likely influenced by many other social or environmental factors than just by differences in the duration of pair bonding...|$|R
50|$|The Stenostiridae {{as a whole}} {{are related}} to <b>penduline</b> <b>tits,</b> titmice and chickadees.

40|$|Elaborate male song may {{restrain}} {{competitors in}} various songbirds, although the exact mechanism, information content and information flow of acoustic signals {{are not completely}} understood. Here {{we focus on the}} interactions between resident and intruder males using the Eurasian <b>penduline</b> <b>tit</b> Remiz pendulinus. The breeding system of this small passerine bird is unusually variable including sequential polygamy by both sexes, and appears to be driven by intense sexual selection and sexual conflict over parental care. We had two objectives in this study: (i) to investigate whether male repertoire size is an intra-sexual signal in <b>penduline</b> <b>tits,</b> and (ii) to determine emitter and receiver roles during acoustic communication between residents and intruders. We tested these objectives in a natural population by recording the resident males' song and then challenging them by song playbacks. The residents' approach to intruder stimuli and behavioural responses were monitored. We found that intruder repertoire size did not evoke different responses by the residents. Rather, the resident's approach distance and behavioural response was predicted by his own repertoire size, suggesting that song in <b>penduline</b> <b>tits</b> is involved in male-male communication, and repertoire size may function as a reliable signal of the resident male's ability and willingness to defend his nest and avert possible intruders...|$|R

40|$|Sexual conflict, the {{different}} interests {{of males and}} females over reproduction, is a potent evolutionary force. Here I investigate sexual conflict in the context of parental care by focussing on two questions: (i) which behavioural, morphological and environmental traits influence the parentsâ€™ decision to care for the brood or desert? (ii) How does sexual conflict influence the evolution of behaviour and morphology? I investigate both questions using a small, polygamous passerine bird, the Eurasian <b>penduline</b> <b>tit</b> Remiz pendulinus, which exhibits intense sexual conflict over parental care such that either the male, the female or both parents desert the clutch. Using detailed behavioural observations during the crucial few days preceding desertion, I argue that it may be in the parentsâ€™ best interest to conceal their intention to care for (or desert) their brood. The rapid resulting process that leads to variable parental care resembles a coordination game in which either parent may desert first. I developed a game-theoretical model that suggests that a key to resolving the conflict between parents is the sex difference in reproductive payoffs for given parental care strategies, rather than differences in parental quality per se. Environmental variables (e. g. food availability and mating opportunities) seem only subsidiary in the decision-making process of parents. My final chapter explores ramifications of sexual conflict at an evolutionary timescale. By comparing the highly polygamous Eurasian <b>penduline</b> <b>tit</b> with the monogamous Cape <b>penduline</b> <b>tit,</b> I show that morphological and behavioural differences between these two species are consistent with predictions of sexual conflict theory. During my PhD I also identified that there is considerable variation in breeding systems within different species of <b>penduline</b> <b>tits.</b> I argue that by studying these systems new insights will emerge into (i) the drivers of breeding systems, and (ii) neural and genomic traits that underlie breeding system evolution.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{tenet of}} sexual conflict {{theory is that}} one sex may increase its reproductive success (RS) even if this harms the other sex. Several studies supported this principle by showing that males benefit from reduced paternal care whereas females suffer from it. By investigating <b>penduline</b> <b>tits</b> Remiz pendulinus in nature, we show that parental conflict may be symmetric between sexes. In this small passerine a single female (or male) cares for the offspring, whereas about 30 % of clutches are deserted by both parents. Deserting parents enhance their RS by obtaining multiple mates, and they reduce the RS of their mates due to increased nest failure. Unlike most other species, however, the antagonistic interests are symmetric in <b>penduline</b> <b>tits,</b> because both sexes enhance their own RS by deserting, whilst harming the RS of their mates. We argue that the strong antagonistic interests of sexes explain the high frequency of biparental desertion. ...|$|R
40|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} distributions {{of resources and}} habitats often influence breeding systems. These influences are particularly relevant in those species that exhibit variable breeding systems. We studied such a species, the <b>Penduline</b> <b>Tit</b> Remiz pendulinus. This small passerine bird has sequential polygamy by both sexes, and evidence suggests intense sexual conflict {{between males and females}} over care. We estimated habitat structure by scoring the vegetation important for nest building and foraging in the immediate surroundings of the nest. Using four principal components we show that sites with more abundant vegetation are occupied earlier than sites with sparse vegetation. However, habitat structure does not predict mating success or reproductive success, and it neither predicts which parent (the male, the female or both) deserts the clutch. We therefore suggest that habitat structure does not have a direct effect on reproductive success or on the resolution of sexual conflict in <b>Penduline</b> <b>Tits.</b> Specific aspects of habitats, such as food and nest material availability, remain to be tested. ...|$|R
40|$|Nest-sites {{often have}} a major {{influence}} on avian reproductive success. The use of reliable cues that assist nest-site selection should thus be favoured by natural selection. The old nests have been known to serve as a cue in nest-site selection in several species. To find out whether the old nests act as cue in nest-site selection in the Eurasian <b>penduline</b> <b>tit</b> Remiz pendulinus, we carried out two experiments in southern Hungary, where the <b>penduline</b> <b>tits</b> breed around fishponds and build sophisticated pendulous nests on tree branches that often hang over water. In April 2006, we choose 20 groups of two nearby trees, and hung an old nest on one of the trees in each group. The male <b>penduline</b> <b>tits</b> choose 12 of these groups to build a new nest, and every of the twelve nests were built on trees with an old nest. This suggests that the old nests serve as a cue in the selection of breeding sites for males when they enter a habitat. To find out whether the old nests are cues of plentiful nest building material, or to signal high quality breeding areas, we carried out a second experiment in 2007 by selecting 13 groups of three nearby trees. A "worn-out" old nest was hung on one of the trees, a "re-utilize" type of old nest on another tree, whereas the third tree was left without an old nest in each group. The rationale was that while the worn-out material of the old nests is of no use in building the new nests, material of the "re-utilize" nests is good enough to be used for building new nests. Males built a new nest in 10 of the 13 groups, and eight of the new nests were built on trees with an old nest. Of the eight new nests, five were built on trees with a "worn-out" old nest and three on trees with a "re-utilize" type of old nest. It appears that for the <b>penduline</b> <b>tit</b> males it is the presence of an existing old nest and not the quality of the old nest material that serves as cue during the selection of the suitable breeding sites...|$|R
