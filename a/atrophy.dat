5|$|Cerebellar <b>atrophy</b> {{has been}} {{observed}} in many other neurological disorders including Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, essential tremor, progressive myoclonus epilepsy, and Niemann–Pick disease.

5|$|Mutant Huntingtin is {{expressed}} {{throughout the body}} and associated with abnormalities in peripheral tissues that are directly caused by such expression outside the brain. These abnormalities include muscle <b>atrophy,</b> cardiac failure, impaired glucose tolerance, weight loss, osteoporosis, and testicular <b>atrophy.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{hippocampus}} contains {{high levels}} of glucocorticoid receptors, which make it more vulnerable to long-term stress than most other brain areas. There is evidence that humans having experienced severe, long-lasting traumatic stress show <b>atrophy</b> of the hippocampus more than of {{other parts of the}} brain. These effects show up in post-traumatic stress disorder, and they may contribute to the hippocampal <b>atrophy</b> reported in schizophrenia and severe depression. A recent study has also revealed <b>atrophy</b> as a result of depression, but this can be stopped with anti-depressants even if they are not effective in relieving other symptoms.|$|E
50|$|DSMA1 was {{identified}} and {{classified as a}} sub-group of spinal muscular <b>atrophies</b> (SMA) in 1974.

5|$|Another {{potential}} health problem is spinal muscular <b>atrophy</b> (SMA), another genetically inherited disease which causes {{the loss of}} the spinal-cord neurons which activate the skeletal muscles of the trunk and limbs. Symptoms are normally seen within 3–4 months of age and result in muscle <b>atrophy,</b> muscle weakness, and a shortened life span. A test is offered to detect the genes responsible for SMA.|$|E
5|$|Other {{conditions}} that are closely linked to cerebellar degeneration include the idiopathic progressive neurological disorders multiple system <b>atrophy</b> and Ramsay Hunt syndrome type I, and the autoimmune disorder paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, in which tumors elsewhere in the body elicit an autoimmune response that causes neuronal loss in the cerebellum. Cerebellar <b>atrophy</b> can result from an acute deficiency of vitamin B1 (thiamine) as seen in beriberi and in Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, or from vitamin E deficiency.|$|E

5|$|A 1999 {{study of}} Cavaliers {{conducted}} by the Canine Eye Registration Foundation showed that an average of 30% of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels evaluated had eye problems. They include hereditary cataracts, corneal dystrophy, distichiasis, entropion, microphthalmia, progressive retinal <b>atrophy,</b> and retinal dysplasia.|$|E
5|$|A 2015 study {{concluded}} that multiple system <b>atrophy</b> (MSA), a rare human neurodegenerative disease, {{is caused by a}} misfolded version of a protein called alpha-synuclein, and is therefore also classifiable as a prion disease. Several yeast proteins have also been identified as having prionogenic properties.|$|E
5|$|Amyloid imaging {{is likely}} to be used in {{conjunction}} with other markers rather than as an alternative. Volumetric MRI can detect changes in the size of brain regions. Measuring those regions that <b>atrophy</b> during the progress of Alzheimer's disease is showing promise as a diagnostic indicator. It may prove less expensive than other imaging methods currently under study.|$|E

5|$|In adults, kidney {{involvement}} progresses to end-stage {{renal disease}} (ESRD) more often than in children. In a UK series of 37 patients, 10 (27%) developed advanced kidney disease.

About 20% of children that exhibit nephrotic or nephritic features experience long permanent renal impairment.|$|E

5|$|Outer space {{represents}} a challenging environment for human exploration {{because of the}} dual hazards of vacuum and radiation.

5|$|When it {{finishes}} its moult migration, {{this bird}} moults its remiges between August and September, {{which makes it}} unable to fly. This moult is preceded {{by an increase in}} weight.

5|$|Current {{preclinical}} {{tests show}} that the SEGRAMs available so far would elicit fewer side effect or at least less grave side effects than classic glucocorticoids would.

There was a significant increase in 2, 3 -DHB in the <b>atrophied</b> muscle. This result strongly suggests the enhanced generation in vivo of hydroxyl radicals in <b>atrophied</b> muscle...|$|R

5|$|Focal {{seizures}} {{begin in}} one hemisphere {{of the brain}} while generalized seizures begin in both hemispheres. Some types of seizures may change brain structure, while others appear to have little effect.

5|$|Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, {{also called}} Avascular Necrosis of the Femoral Head, {{is where the}} ball section of the femur in the hip joint deteriorates {{following}} interruption of the blood flow and is the same condition as in humans. In dogs, this causes lameness of the hind-legs, the thigh muscles to <b>atrophy</b> and pain in the joint. It usually occurs between 6–12 months of age and has been documented {{in a variety of}} other terrier breeds including the Border terrier, Lakeland terrier, and Wheaten terrier.|$|E
5|$|Other {{causes that}} can {{secondarily}} produce parkinsonism are stroke and drugs. Parkinson plus syndromes such as progressive supranuclear palsy and multiple system <b>atrophy</b> must be ruled out. Anti-Parkinson's medications are typically less effective at controlling symptoms in Parkinson plus syndromes. Faster progression rates, early cognitive dysfunction or postural instability, minimal tremor or symmetry at onset may indicate a Parkinson plus disease rather than PD itself. Genetic forms with an autosomal dominant or recessive pattern of inheritance are {{sometimes referred to}} as familial Parkinson's disease or familial parkinsonism.|$|E

40|$|The {{treatment}} of severely <b>atrophied</b> posterior mandibles with standard-diameter root-form implants may present a challenge. Bone reconstructive surgery represents the {{treatment of}} choice; however, {{it may not be}} accepted by some patients for economic reasons or due to higher morbidity. Computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technologies have recently opened new frontiers in biomedical applications. Selective laser sintering (SLS) is a CAD/CAM technique that allows the fabrication of complex three-dimensional (3 D) structures created by computer-generated image-based design techniques. The aim {{of this study is to}} present a protocol for the manufacture and clinical use of custom-made SLS titanium blade implants as a non-conventional therapeutic treatment for the prosthetic rehabilitation of extremely <b>atrophied</b> posterior mandibles. Computed tomography datasets of five patients were transferred to a specific reconstruction software, where a 3 D projection of the <b>atrophied</b> mandible was obtained, and custom-made endosseous blade implants were designed. The custom-made implants were fabricated with SLS technique, placed in the extremely <b>atrophied</b> posterior (< 4  mm width) mandible, and immediately restored with fixed partial restorations. After 2  years of loading, all implants were in function, showing a good esthetic integration. Blade implants can be fabricated on an individual basis as a custom-designed device. This non-conventional approach may represent an option for restoring the <b>atrophied</b> posterior mandible of elderly patients. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London Ltd...|$|R
