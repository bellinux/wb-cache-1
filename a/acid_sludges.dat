Testing also included characterization of the simulated and radioactive waste sludges. Testing results showed the following: Dissolution of simulated HM and PUREX sludges with oxalic and citric acid mixtures at SRTC confirmed general trends reported previously by Russian testing. Unlike the previous Russian testing six sequential contacts of a mixture of oxalic acid citric acids at a 2 : 1 ratio (v/w) of <b>acid</b> to <b>sludge</b> did not produce complete dissolution of simulated HM and PUREX sludges. We observed that increased sludge dissolution occurred at a higher <b>acid</b> to <b>sludge</b> ratio, 50 : 1 (v/w), compared to the recommended ratio of 2 : 1 (v/w). We observed much lower dissolution of aluminum in a simulated HM sludge by sodium hydroxide leaching. We attribute the low aluminum dissolution in caustic to the high fraction of boehmite present in the simulated sludge. Dissolution of HLW sludges with 4 per cent oxalic acid and oxalic/citric acid followed general trends observed with simulated sludges. The limited testing suggests that a mixture of oxalic and citric acids is more efficient for dissolving HM and PUREX sludges and provides a more homogeneous dissolution of HM <b>sludge</b> than oxalic <b>acid</b> alone. Dissolution of HLW sludges in oxalic and oxalic/citric acid mixtures produced residual sludge solids that measured at higher neutron poison to equivalent 235 U weight ratios than that in the untreated sludge solids. This finding suggests that residual solids do not present an increased nuclear criticality safety risk. Generally the neutron poison to equivalent 235 U weight ratios of the acid solutions containing dissolved sludge components are lower {{than those in the}} untreated sludge solids. We recommend that these results be evaluated further to determine if these solutions contain sufficient neutron poisons. We observed low general corrosion rates in tests in which carbon steel coupons were contacted with solutions of oxalic acid, citric acid and mixtures of oxalic and citric acids. Wall thinning can be minimized by maintaining short contact times with these acid solutions. We recommend additional testing with oxalic and oxalic/citric acid mixtures to measure dissolution performance of sludges that have not been previously dried. This testing should include tests to clearly ascertain the effects of total acid strength and metal complexation on dissolution performance.

40|$|The Savannah River Site (SRS) {{will remove}} sludge {{as part of}} waste tank closure operations. Typically the bulk sludge is removed by mixing it with {{supernate}} to produce a slurry, and transporting the slurry to a downstream tank for processing. Experience shows that a residual heel may remain in the tank that cannot be removed by this conventional technique. In the past, SRS used oxalic acid solutions to disperse or dissolve the sludge heel to complete the waste removal. To better understand the actual conditions of oxalic acid cleaning of waste from carbon steel tanks, the authors developed and conducted an experimental program to determine its effectiveness in dissolving sludge, the hydrogen generation rate, the generation rate of other gases, the carbon steel corrosion rate, the impact of mixing on chemical cleaning, the impact of temperature, {{and the types of}} precipitates formed during the neutralization process. The test samples included actual SRS sludge and simulated SRS sludge. The authors performed the simulated waste tests at 25, 50, and 75 C by adding 8 wt % oxalic <b>acid</b> to the <b>sludge</b> over seven days. They conducted the actual waste tests at 50 and 75 C by adding 8 wt % oxalic <b>acid</b> to the <b>sludge</b> as a single batch. Following the testing, SRS conducted chemical cleaning with oxalic acid in two waste tanks. In Tank 5 F, the oxalic acid (8 wt %) addition occurred over seven days, followed by inhibited water to ensure the tank contained enough liquid to operate the mixer pumps. The tank temperature during oxalic acid addition and dissolution was approximately 45 C. The authors analyzed samples from the chemical cleaning process and compared it with test data. The conclusions from the work are: (1) Oxalic acid addition proved effective in dissolving sludge heels in the simulant demonstration, the actual waste demonstration, and in SRS Tank 5 F. (2) The oxalic acid dissolved {approx} 100 % of the uranium, {approx} 100 % of the iron, and {approx} 40 % of the manganese during a single contact in the simulant demonstration. (The iron dissolution may be high due to corrosion of carbon steel coupons.) (3) The oxalic acid dissolved {approx} 80 % of the uranium, {approx} 70 % of the iron, {approx} 50 % of the manganese, and {approx} 90 % of the aluminum in the actual waste demonstration for a single contact. (4) The oxalic acid dissolved {approx} 100 % of the uranium, {approx} 15 % of the iron, {approx} 40 % of the manganese, and {approx} 80 % of the aluminum in Tank 5 F during the first contact cycle. Except for the iron, these results agree well with the demonstrations. The data suggest that a much larger fraction of the iron in the sludge dissolved, but it re-precipitated with the oxalate added to Tank 5 F.

C:N ratios need to be understood to determine probability of nutrient leaching and water contamination. Microbial activity on the humic <b>acid</b> fraction of <b>sludge</b> is directed toward the readily degradable constituents containing single chain functional groups. This finding indicate that amendments with lower molecular constituents such as aliphatic compounds are more amenable to microbial degradation, therefore serves as better nutrient sources to enhance the formation of vegetation in mine lands and leads to more efficient carbon sequestration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Batch methanogenic {{toxicity}} and biodegradability of 2 -, 3 - and 4 -aminobenzoic acids (ABA) {{as well as}} 4 - and 5 -aminosalicylic acids (ASA) {{have been}} studied {{in the presence of}} two mesophilic (Shell and cattle) and one thermophilic sludges. The aminoaromatics tested practically did not inhibit methanogenesis up to concentrations of 3 – 7 g/l; moreover, some of them (2 -ABA, 4 -ABA and 5 -ASA) even exert a stimulating effect on aceticlastic activity of the sludges. Concerning biodegradability, 5 -ASA was completely mineralised by all the sludges tested; however, 4 -ASA was not degraded at all by any of the sludges. Both mesophilic sludges were able to perform a complete mineralization of 2 -ABA but this was not a case for the thermophilic sludge. 3 -ABA was not biodegraded only {{in the presence of the}} Shell sludge. On the contrary, 4 -ABA was quantitatively mineralised only by the Shell sludge. All the adapted sludges were able to mineralise the corresponding aminoaromatics in N-deprived media. Cross-acclimatisation trials showed that 2 -ABA-, 5 -ASA- and salicylic <b>acid</b> adapted <b>sludges</b> were unable to degrade any other aminoaromatics tested that manifest about a different nature of key bacteria responsible for primary decomposition of these substrates. The main possibility of continuous mineralization of 2 -ABA as a unique source of carbon and nitrogen has been demonstrated using mesophilic UASB reactor inoculated by adapted sludge...|$|R
40|$|The Savannah River Site (SRS) has 49 {{high level}} waste (HLW) tanks {{that must be}} emptied, cleaned, and closed as {{required}} by the Federal Facilities Agreement. The current method of chemical cleaning uses several hundred thousand gallons per tank of 8 weight percent (wt%) oxalic acid to partially dissolve and suspend residual waste and corrosion products such that the waste can be pumped out of the tank. This adds a significant quantity of sodium oxalate to the tanks and, if multiple tanks are cleaned, renders the waste incompatible with the downstream processing. Tank space is also insufficient to store this stream given the large number of tanks to be cleaned. Therefore, a search for a new cleaning process was initiated utilizing the TRIZ literature search approach, and Chemical Oxidation Reduction Decontamination [...] Ultraviolet (CORD-UV), a mature technology currently used for decontamination and cleaning of commercial nuclear reactor primary cooling water loops, was identified. CORD-UV utilizes oxalic <b>acid</b> for <b>sludge</b> dissolution, but then decomposes the oxalic acid to carbon dioxide and water by UV treatment outside the system being treated. This allows reprecipitation and subsequent deposition of the sludge into a selected container without adding significant volume to that container, and without adding any new chemicals that would impact downstream treatment processes. Bench top and demonstration loop measurements on SRS tank sludge stimulant demonstrated the feasibility of applying CORD-UV for enhanced chemical cleaning of SRS HLW tanks...|$|R
