5|$|Finless {{porpoises}} have commonly {{been kept}} in Japan, {{as well as}} China and Indonesia. Ninety four in total have been in captivity in Japan, eleven in China, {{and at least two}} in Indonesia. Japan has had three establishments designated for breeding them, and there have been five recorded births. Three calves died moments after their birth, but two survived for several years. This breeding success proved that porpoises can be successfully bred in captivity, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> open up new conservation options.|$|E

5|$|These {{numbers are}} (by ancient standards) consistent, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> be {{interpreted}} {{that a number}} around 1,200 is correct. Among modern scholars some have accepted this number, although suggesting that the number must have been lower by the Battle of Salamis. Other recent works on the Persian Wars reject this number1,207 being seen {{as more of a}} reference to the combined Greek fleet in the Iliadand generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean.|$|E

5|$|There is {{evidence}} that some of Victoria's descendants did have mild porphyria (although some historians now think {{it could have been}} bi-polar disorder), most notably Princess Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen. This disease may have affected her grandfather, George III <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> give credence to Victoria's legitimate birth. There is more reliable documentation that one of her great-great-grandsons, Prince William of Gloucester, was diagnosed with the disease shortly before his death when his aircraft crashed during an air race. Concrete evidence on the origins of the disease and paternity of Victoria could be achieved with a DNA test of her or her parents' remains, but no such study has been sanctioned by the Royal Family.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to serotonin reuptake inhibition, clomipramine {{is also a}} mild but clinically significant antagonist of the dopamine D1, D2, and D3 receptors at high concentrations. Addition of antipsychotics, which are potent dopamine receptor antagonists, to SSRIs, {{has been found to}} significantly augment their effectiveness in the treatment of OCD. As such, besides strong serotonin reuptake inhibition, clomipramine at high doses might also block dopamine receptors to treat OCD symptoms, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> additionally or alternatively be involved in its possible effectiveness advantage over SSRIs.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes the pancarte was recopied after {{a number}} of {{additions}} had been made to the original, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> occasionally lead to errors in chronology, as the additions to the original might have been made without respect to the actual order of the donations. The historian Marjorie Chibnall states that the medieval historian Orderic Vitalis used now lost pancartes of various Norman monastic houses as sources for his historical writings. The surviving pancartes are important not only for their recording of now-lost charters, but also for understanding the history of historical writing.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{hovering}} {{tests showed}} {{problems and the}} V1 was not to fly until 1940.

While this will expand the breeding locations of the monarch, this will also have the effect of increasing the distance that monarchs must travel to reach their overwintering destination in Mexico, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> result in greater mortality during the migration.|$|E

25|$|There is {{one major}} piece of {{evidence}} suggesting that abnormal connectivity occurs in autism. Autistic brains are known to develop very rapidly early in life, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> cause problems {{in the development of}} cortical connections. It has been suggested that this early overdevelopment may be a cause for the impaired connectivity in autism. Diffusion tensor imaging studies of autistic brains are consistent with this idea, as they show reduced myelination (see:Myelin) in the areas of the brain that deal with social cognition and theory of mind, or one’s ability to comprehend what another person may be thinking. This provides further evidence for underconnectivity of the autistic brain.|$|E
25|$|Up to 25% of {{military}} burials were of armed Sarmatian women usually including bows. Russian archaeologist Vera Kovalevskaya {{points out that}} when Scythian men were away fighting or hunting, nomadic women {{would have to be}} able to defend themselves, their animals and pasture-grounds competently. During the time that the Scythians advanced into Asia and achieved near-hegemony in the Near East, there was a period of twenty-eight years when the men would have been away on campaigns for long periods. During this time the women would not only have had to defend themselves, but to reproduce, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> well be the origin of the idea that Amazons mated once a year with their neighbours, if Herodotus actually based his accounts on fact.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that the average global equilibrium temperature (the temperature {{in the absence of}} atmospheric effects) of Gliese 581g would range from 209 to 228K (−64 to −45°C, or −84 to −49°F) for Bond albedos (reflectivities) from 0.5 to 0.3 (with the latter being more characteristic of the inner Solar System). Adding an Earthlike greenhouse effect would yield an average surface temperature in the range of 236 to 261K (−37 to −12°C, or −35 to 10°F). Gliese 581g would be in an orbit where a silicate weathering thermostat could operate, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> lead to accumulation of sufficient carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to permit liquid water to exist at the surface, provided the planet's composition and tectonic behavior could support sustained outgassing.|$|E
