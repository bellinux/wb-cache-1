40|$|Every {{state and}} the District of Columbia use {{voluntary}} <b>acknowledgments</b> <b>of</b> <b>paternity.</b> Created pursuant to federal law, the acknowledgment is signed by the purported biological parents and establishes paternity without requiring court involvement. Intended to be a “simple civil process” to establish paternity where the parents are unmarried, the acknowledgment is used by state governments to expedite child support litigation. But federal policy and state laws governing the acknowledgments do not sufficiently protect the interests of those men who have signed acknowledgments and who subsequently discover that they lack genetic ties to the children in question. A signatory who learns {{that he is not}} the child’s biological father and who wishes to challenge the validity <b>of</b> the <b>acknowledgment</b> must navigate a difficult process for relief. The very act <b>of</b> signing an <b>acknowledgment</b> may subsequently prevent him from offering any scientific evidence of the absence of a biological connection to the child. As a result, he may be obligated to pay child support for years on the basis <b>of</b> that erroneous <b>paternity</b> <b>acknowledgment,</b> and a parent-child relationship may be imposed even if it is not in the child’s best interests. Using the District of Columbia as a model to highlight the need for procedural reform, this Article examines the federal and D.

40|$|A {{natural father}} is usually afforded under American law the unique "opportunity [...] . {{to develop a}} {{relationship}} with his offspring" born to an unwed mother {{as a result of}} consensual sexual intercourse. This paternity opportunity interest often merits federal constitutional due process protection. Its enforcement, however, is often impaired by unfair state paternity designation procedures, especially in birth certificate settings. Inadequate procedures cause systematic losses of parental rights for "many responsible" natural fathers. Under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress can act to enforce better male parental rights. It should now unify certain birth certificate practices for all children born in the United States to unwed mothers. In particular, Congress should improve the procedures for locating and educating natural fathers eligible for parental rights.

Buscamos desenvolver este estudo, sob o ponto de vista preponderante de que os imaginários sociais sustentam determinada imagem de pai e, ainda, eles permeiam o processo de constituição da paternidade representada discursivamente no discurso jurídico. Para tanto, utilizamos os pressupostos teóricos de Plantin (2008, 2010), Amossy (2005, 2006, 2007), Ducrot (1987, 2009), Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca (1996), dentre outros. Procuramos entender, a partir destas contribuições teóricas, como se dá a estruturação do processo argumentativo e como o uso das estratégias linguístico-discursivas {{interfere}} na produção discursiva dos produtores textuais jurídicos. Postulamos que a representação masculina foi delineada, culturalmente, por diversas formas de socialização, sobretudo das práticas discursivas apreendidas no contexto das mudanças das representações sociais masculinas e no modo como estas se articulavam às práticas sociais tanto nas sociedades tradicionais quanto nas sociedades contemporâneas do Ocidente. This work aims at {{conducting an}} analysis {{based on the}} researches on argumentation, which allows us to identify how paternity is constructed discursively by the subjects involved in the discourse of a lawsuit for <b>acknowledgment</b> <b>of</b> <b>paternity.</b> This study was developed {{taking into account the}} prevailing view that the social imaginaries hold a certain father figure and that they also permeate the process of establishment of paternity, discursively represented in the legal discourse.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{identify}} and describe the difficulties faced by families with nonmarital children (especially single-parent), available help and support, participation of the father in raising a child, and expected institutional help. That represents a first step toward better understanding of these families. The paper presents part of the results of research carried out in Belgrade with the aim of insight into the phenomenon of nonmarital childbearing at the individual level. It was conducted on a sample of 100 respondents, mothers of nonmarital children, who attend preschool. The survey was anonymous, carried out by the interview method. For this purpose a questionnaire with more than 50 questions was made, standardized to a great extent. In this paper, the focus is on the hardships and needs of the group of lone mothers. Though some issues take into account the answers of all respondents (21 cohabited mothers and 79 lone mothers), the analysis is largely related to the experiences and reflections of lone mothers. The 2011 Census data on prevalence of consensual unions and characteristics of persons living in them, as well as earlier data on the <b>acknowledgment</b> <b>of</b> <b>paternity,</b> do not indicate that nonmarital childbearing in Serbia takes place primarily in stable unions. It is realistic to assume that a large percentage of mothers with nonmarital children are lone mothers. The research results are generally consistent with the findings of relevant studies from our and foreign countries. As the largest difficulties, lone mothers emphasize financial problems, unemployment, housing difficulties, and child care, as well as a pronounced feeling of loneliness. Most of them in solving problems and rising children rely on their parents and siblings, with whom they often live in the same household. Every fifth lone mother when faced with a major problem, and every ninth in everyday raising a child can count on the father of the child. About a third of the children have no contact with their father, and as many fathers do not make any financial contribution. Actually, insufficient presence and participation of the father, in the lives of children and in daily performing parental responsibilities of their mothers, is one of the most important aspects that deserve the attention of researchers and policy-makers when it comes to lone mothers with unmarital children. The realization of children's rights in relation to financing and visitation the fathers after parental separation, is far more difficult than in divorced or widowed single-parent families. Some considerations about measures of state and local community support can be based on the selected research results presented in this paper. Support measures are possible in multiple domains, social policy (financial support and assistance in employment), institutions of preschool education, as well as in health, education, pre-school and social system counseling services. Greater involvement of men in family life and parenthood stands out as a very important objective, as well as motivation of fathers to involve in raising their nonresident children, including financial support. Three-quarters of the total number of respondents expect the state support to lone unmarried mothers. Three-quarters of lone mothers and one third of cohabited mothers expressed the need for state assistance in solving their own most important existential issues...|$|E
40|$|The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (Convention) protects {{parents with}} primary custody rights from parental {{abduction}} or retention {{of their children}} in another country. However, as more couples in the United States forgo marriage but continue having children, these couples-who often prefer informal parenting arrangements-do not often obtain court orders that identify their custody or visitation rights. Yet if an unmarried parent relocated to another country without the other parent 2 ̆ 7 s consent, the parties would {{have to rely on}} the state 2 ̆ 7 s default custody rules to determine where the custody battle should ensue. For example, Mexican jurisdictions follow a Roman civil law tradition, patria potestas (parental authority). From birth or voluntary acknowledgement of paternity, parental authority gives both parents the right to care and control their children and their children 2 ̆ 7 s property. However, in most United States jurisdictions, custody rights do not arise automatically simply because a child was born to unmarried parents. Instead, voluntary <b>acknowledgment</b> <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> serves as a basis from which a parent can seek the court 2 ̆ 7 s determination of custody in the child 2 ̆ 7 s best interests. These differences in approaches to child custody appeared in two recent Convention cases in the Seventh Circuit. In both Garcia v. Pinelo and Martinez v. Cahue, the unmarried fathers voluntarily acknowledged paternity of their children. In Garcia, the Seventh Circuit found that the unmarried father, who resided in Mexico, had a right of custody under the Convention pursuant to the Mexican laws of parental authority. In contrast, in Martinez, the Seventh Circuit found that Illinois law presumes, {{in the absence of a}} court order, an unmarried mother has sole custody of her child. Therefore, the unmarried father in Martinez, who did not obtain a custody order before the mother moved to Mexico, did not have any rights of custody under the Convention, despite having acknowledged paternity. In light of demographic trends towards fewer marriages and more informal parenting arrangements, should jurisdictions like Illinois adopt child custody rules that endow rights of custody to both parents at birth or upon acknowledgement of the child? In order to protect children 2 ̆ 7 s best interests and to preserve the status quo before an alleged wrongful retention or abduction, Illinois should not adopt a rule like parental authority laws. While as a society we may want parents to share significant decision-making and to cooperate regarding their children 2 ̆ 7 s upbringing, default rules regarding children should protect children 2 ̆ 7 s best interests rather than parental rights. Illinois 2 ̆ 7 s presumption requires a court to consider the children 2 ̆ 7 s best interests before awarding custody and visitation rights while parental authority laws automatically confer decision-making authority to parents. Children 2 ̆ 7 s best interests are better served when a court protects stability and the status quo in children 2 ̆ 7 s lives rather than enabling a parent to assert parental rights for the first time under a Hague Convention petition...|$|E

40|$|The Act makes {{sweeping}} changes to Georgia 2 ̆ 7 s child and spousal support enforcement procedures by shifting {{the bulk of}} enforcement authority from the court system to the Child Support Enforcement Agency of the Department of Human Resources (DHR). First, the Act amends several of Georgia 2 ̆ 7 s alimony and child support statutes. It removes {{the statute of limitations}} for foreign judgments of child or spousal support orders and provides that child or spousal support orders cannot be changed retroactively or become dormant. It makes late child support payments judgments by operation of law, sets a time limit for contempt hearings, and allows for the revocation, denial, or suspension of recreational licenses for support order non-compliance. It requires income deduction orders to be entered with all orders establishing, enforcing, or modifying a support order and allows the IV-D Agency to provide for withholding upon the accrual of a thirty-day arrearage without the need for a hearing or order. The Act also requires notice to the obligor and lays out procedures for contesting withholding orders. Second, the Act amends numerous statutes governing the parent-child relationship. It allows the father, in a DHR-initiated paternity determination petition, to intervene to legitimize the child if the mother consents to such legitimation, and it disentitles the parties to the right to a jury trial in procedures to determine paternity. Under the Act, a party may move that parents and the child or children submit to genetic testing if the motion is accompanied by a sworn affidavit alleging or denying paternity, and the DHR is allowed to order genetic tests when paternity has not been established. The Act creates a rebuttable presumption of paternity, which can be overcome by clear and convincing evidence, and allows for a temporary support order pending determination of parentage. It also directs the trier of fact to receive evidence of the cost of prenatal car, birth, and genetic testing without foundation or third-party testimony. Further, it provides that when both parents have signed a voluntary <b>acknowledgment</b> <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> and the acknowledgment is recorded in the putative father registry, the acknowledgment constitutes a legal determination of paternity unless a parent rescinds within sixty days. Third, the Act makes extensive amendments and additions to the Child Support Recovery Act. It expands the duty to furnish information to DHR or its authorized contractors, concerning and obligor, to any entity in Georgia including profit, nonprofit, and governmental employers and provides for punishment for noncompliance with such request for information. Also expanded is the duty of all employers doing business in Georgia to report the hiring or rehiring of persons to the state support registry. The Act provides that the final administrative order for support shall have the safe effect as an order of a superior court and shall be enforceable. It also requires the IV-D Agency to provide all involved parties with notice and copies of orders. The Act provides the IV-D Agency with broad authority to identify, and file and perfect liens on an obligor 2 ̆ 7 s property, including real and tangible personal property as well as some intangible property. It also directs DHR to safeguard against the unauthorized use or disclosure of certain information. Further, the Act establishes the Department of Administrative Services Bank Math Registry, which will contain information only on obligors whom the IV-D Agency believes owe child support and are not under order, and those who are delinquent by one month or more. The Act specifies procedures to be used by the financial institutions, the IV-D Agency, and the Department of Administrative Services, and establishes punishment for noncooperative financial institutions. Through the Bank Match Registry, the IV-D Agency has the authority to identify, encumber, and/or seize account assets of delinquent obligors. Fourth, the Act provides that the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (URESA) be superseded by the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA). UIFSA outlines jurisdictional procedures and rules when dealing with out-of-state judgments or parties. It provides extended jurisdiction and full faith and credit among and between the states as well as a method to determine which order is controlling when multiple orders have been issued with regard to an obligor and an obligee...|$|E
