5|$|An {{alignment}} {{is calculated}} {{by measuring the}} azimuth, the angle from north, of the structure and the altitude of the horizon it faces The azimuth is usually measured using a theodolite or a compass. A compass is easier to use, though the deviation of the Earth's magnetic field from true north, known as its magnetic declination {{must be taken into}} account. Compasses are also unreliable in areas prone to magnetic interference, such as sites being supported by scaffolding. Additionally a compass can only measure the azimuth to <b>a</b> <b>precision</b> of a half a degree.|$|E

5|$|In {{early to}} mid-2009, several {{narcotics}} and bomb-making facilities were raided by British forces, supported by Apaches. In April 2009, {{it was reported}} that an Apache had been used to intercept a suicide bombing attack in Helmand province. During the Summer of 2009, British Apaches were an integral component of Operation Panther's Claw, which was aimed at pushing insurgents out of civilian areas in the runup to the 2009 Afghan Elections. During this major offensive, Apaches from the UK routinely flew alongside US Cobra helicopters to provide air support to soldiers of 3rd Battalion Black Watch and the Royal Marines conducting ground operations. During the Summer 2009 operations, a senior Taliban leader, Mullah Mansur, and several accomplices were killed in <b>a</b> <b>precision</b> strike launched by an Apache.|$|E

5|$|In {{laboratory}} conditions, {{the interactions}} of individual electrons can be observed by means of particle detectors, which allow measurement of specific properties such as energy, spin and charge. The development of the Paul trap and Penning trap allows charged particles to be contained within a small region for long durations. This enables precise measurements of the particle properties. For example, in one instance a Penning trap was used to contain a single electron {{for a period of}} 10 months. The magnetic moment of the electron was measured to <b>a</b> <b>precision</b> of eleven digits, which, in 1980, was a greater accuracy than for any other physical constant.|$|E
5|$|Many {{attempts}} were made to reconstruct the exact mass of the Roman pound. One method for doing this consists in weighing old coins; another uses the fact that Roman weight units were derived from Roman units of length similarly to the way the kilogramme was originally derived from the metre, i.e. by weighing a known volume of water. Nowadays the Roman pound is often given as 327.45g, but one should keep in mind that (apart from the other uncertainties that come with such a reconstruction) the Roman weight standard is unlikely to have remained constant to such <b>a</b> <b>precision</b> over the centuries, and that the provinces often had somewhat inexact copies of the standard. The weight and subdivision of the pound in the Holy Roman Empire was reformed by Charlemagne, but in the Byzantine Empire it remained essentially the same. Since Byzantine coins circulated up to Scandinavia, the old Roman standard continued to be influential through the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{the crew}} {{successfully}} completed all fifty-four {{of the planned}} mission test objectives. While the INSAT deployment was a success, the satellite had problems unfolding its solar array once in geostationary orbit, and was not fully operational {{until the middle of}} September. Once functional, however, it provided satisfactory service for seven years, returning 36,000 images of Earth and broadcasting television to thousands of remote Indian villages.

5|$|Several {{relativistic}} {{effects are}} directly related to the relativity of direction. One is geodetic precession: the axis direction of a gyroscope in free fall in curved spacetime will change when compared, for instance, with the direction of light received from distant stars—even though such a gyroscope represents the way of keeping a direction as stable as possible ("parallel transport"). For the Moon–Earth system, this effect has been measured with the help of lunar laser ranging. More recently, it has been measured for test masses aboard the satellite Gravity Probe B to <b>a</b> <b>precision</b> of better than 0.3%.|$|E
5|$|Transit {{observations}} in 1874 and 1882 allowed this value to be refined further. Three expeditions—from Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States—were {{sent to the}} Kerguelen Archipelago for the 1874 observations. The American astronomer Simon Newcomb combined {{the data from the}} last four transits, and he arrived at a value of about 149.59 million kilometers (±0.31 million kilometers). Modern techniques, {{such as the use of}} radio telemetry from space probes, and of radar measurements of the distances to planets and asteroids in the Solar System, have allowed a reasonably accurate value for the astronomical unit (AU) to be calculated to <b>a</b> <b>precision</b> of about ±30 meters. As a result, the need for parallax calculations has been superseded.|$|E
5|$|Van Eyck's {{earlier work}} often shows churches and cathedrals in older Romanesque style, {{sometimes}} {{to represent the}} Temple in Jerusalem as an appropriate historical setting, with decoration drawn exclusively from the Old Testament.

The church in this panel is contemporary Gothic – a choice perhaps intended to associate Mary with the Ecclesia Triumphans – while her pose and oversized scale are indebted to the forms and conventions of Byzantine art and the International Gothic.

5|$|Four of XXIBomber Command's {{next five}} raids were made against targets in Nagoya. The first {{two of these}} attacks on 13 and 18December used {{precision}} bombing tactics, and damaged the city's aircraft plants. The third raid was a daylight incendiary attack which was conducted after the Twentieth Air Force directed that 100 B-29s armed with M-69 bombs be dispatched against Nagoya to test {{the effectiveness of these}} weapons on a Japanese city. Hansell protested this order, as he believed that precision attacks were starting to produce results and moving to area bombardment would be counterproductive, but agreed to the operation after he was assured that it did not represent a general shift in tactics. Despite the change in armament, the 22December raid was planned as <b>a</b> <b>precision</b> attack on an aircraft factory using only 78 bombers, and bad weather meant that little damage was caused. XXIBomber Command raided the Musashino aircraft plant in Tokyo again on 27December, but did not damage the facility.
