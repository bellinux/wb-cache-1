500|$|The Athsheans, in contrast, {{are shown}} as an {{innately}} peaceful and non-aggressive people, {{at least at}} the beginning of novel. Rape and murder are virtually unknown on the planet. They have adopted a number of behaviors that preempt violence; thus when Selver has Davidson pinned down after the attack on Smith camp, he finds himself unable to kill Davidson, despite the hate he feels towards the Terran. Selver spends much of the novel reflecting on the effect that violence has on his own culture. He turns to violence, against the Athshean ethic, in order to save his culture <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it.</b> However, unlike Davidson, who enjoys killing, Selver sees it as something poisoning his culture. This perception is shared by his fellow Athsheans: one of the elders of the Athsheans says to Selver [...] "You've done what you had to do, and it was not right." ...|$|E

2500|$|All the Masses are freely {{composed}} plainsong paraphrases - which fulfills {{the requirement}} of the eradication of secular influences. It {{is interesting to note}} that Animuccia’s presentation of an ‘intelligible’ style is only evident in the Gloria and the Credo, [...] and even here he seems reluctant to strip all ‘artifice’ from the music. Instead he alternates homophonic phrases with polyphonic phrases. In his book of Masses Animuccia is consciously trying to compose music that reconciles, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it,</b> the two polarities in this issue of composing ‘intelligible’ music: that of making the text audible, yet at the same time sounding beautiful – therefore fulfilling the music’s most important function of drawing the listener deeper into prayer and closer to God. Other significant stylistic features of Animuccia’s composition style include variations in vocal textures and color by varying voice groupings, and instances of word painting.|$|E
2500|$|Almodóvar has {{incorporated}} {{elements of}} underground and LGBT culture into mainstream forms with wide crossover appeal; academics have recognised the director's significance in queer cinema. Almodóvar dislikes being pigeonholed {{as a gay}} filmmaker, but Courtney Young from Pop Matters claimed that he has pushed boundaries by playing with the expectations of gender and sexuality, which places {{his work in the}} queer cinematic canon. Young also commented on Almodóvar's fluid idea of sexuality; within his films, LGBT characters do not need to come out as they are already sexually liberated, [...] "enlivening the narrative with complex figures that move beyond trite depictions of the LGBTQI experience". She also wrote {{about the importance of the}} relationships between gay men and straight women in Almodóvar's films. In conclusion, Young stated, [...] "Almodóvar is an auteur that designates the queer experience <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> the dignity, respect, attention, and recognition it so deserves".|$|E

2500|$|In {{a survey}} of children's books which [...] "teach about {{emotional}} life," [...] Laura Jana wrote, [...] "On the one hand, {{this is a story}} of how an undeniably quirky teenage boy clings to order, deals with a family crisis, and tries {{to make sense of the}} world <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it.</b> But it also provides profound insight into a disorder—autism—that leaves those who have it struggling to perceive even the most basic of human emotions. In so doing, The Curious Incident leaves its readers with a greater appreciation of their own ability to feel, express, and interpret emotions. This mainstream literary success made its way to the top of the New York Times bestseller list for fiction at the same time it was being touted by experts in Asperger's syndrome and autism-spectrum disorder as an unrivaled fictional depiction of the inner workings of an autistic teenage boy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul proposes sharply {{reducing}} the government's regulation of medications and health supplements by {{reducing the}} role of, and ultimately eliminating, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In a 2011 interview, Paul said, [...] "Well, the FDA just serves the drug companies... they also prevent drugs from coming on the market [...] 10, 15 years later than other countries have it. So, yes, government just {{gets in the way}} on so many of those things." [...] He favors allowing FDA-approved prescription drugs to be imported from foreign countries and sold at a lower cost than the same drugs otherwise sell for in the US – thereby allowing international markets to set drug prices in the US market – a practice that has been prohibited by the FDA. In the interest, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it,</b> of fighting for greater freedom of choice for consumers, he has also introduced bills that would significantly reduce the government's ability to prevent manufacturers or sellers of dietary supplements and certain other health products from making what government regulators believe to be false or misleading claims about the health effects of the products. He essentially feels that consumers should be able to buy whatever health aids they want from whomever they want, without the need for guidance by the government.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variety of}} edited Garfield strips {{have been made}} {{available}} on the Internet, some hosted on their own unofficial, dedicated sites. Dating from 2005, a site called the [...] "Garfield Randomizer" [...] created a three-panel strip using panels from previous Garfield strips. Another approach, known as [...] "Silent Garfield", involves removing Garfield's thought balloons from the strips. Some examples date from 2006. A webcomic called Arbuckle does the above but also redraws the originals in a different art style. [...] The Arbuckle website creator writes: [...] "'Garfield' changes from being a comic about a sassy, corpulent feline, and becomes a compelling picture of a lonely, pathetic, delusional man who talks to his pets. Consider that Jon, according to Garfield canon, cannot hear his cat's thoughts. This is the world <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it.</b> This is his story". Another variation along the same lines, called [...] "Realfield" [...] or [...] "Realistic Garfield", is to redraw Garfield as a real cat as well as removing his thought balloons. Still another approach to editing the strips involves removing Garfield and other main characters from the originals completely, leaving Jon talking to himself. While strips in this vein can be found online as early as 2006, the 2008 site Garfield Minus Garfield by Dan Walsh received enough online attention to be covered by news media. Reception was largely positive: at its peak, the site received as many as 300,000 hits per day. Fans connected with Jon's [...] "loneliness and desperation" [...] and found his [...] "crazy antics" [...] humorous; Jim Davis himself called Walsh's strips an [...] "inspired thing to do" [...] and said that [...] "some of [...] work better [...] ". Ballantine Books, which publishes the Garfield books, released a volume of Garfield Minus Garfield strips on October 28, 2008. The volume retains Davis as author and features a foreword by Walsh.|$|E

2500|$|Because of Marx's {{belief that}} the {{individual}} {{is a product of}} society, Althusser holds that it is pointless to try to build a social theory on a prior conception of the individual. The subject of observation is not individual human elements, but rather [...] "structure". <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it,</b> Marx does not explain society by appealing to the properties of individual persons—their beliefs, desires, preferences, and judgements. Rather, Marx defines society as a set of fixed [...] "levels" [...] and [...] "practices". He uses this analysis to defend Marx's historical materialism against the charge that it crudely posits a base (economic level) and superstructure (culture/politics) [...] "rising upon it" [...] and then attempts to explain all aspects of the superstructure by appealing to features of the (economic) base (the well known architectural metaphor). For Althusser, {{it is a mistake to}} attribute this economic determinist view to Marx. In much the same way that Althusser criticises the idea of a social theory founded on an historical conception of human needs, so he critiques the idea that economic practice can be used in isolation to explain other aspects of society. Althusser believes that both the base and the superstructure are interdependent, although he keeps to the classic Marxist materialist understanding of the determination of the base [...] "in the last instance" [...] (albeit with some extension and revision). The advantage of levels and practices over individuals as a starting point is that although each practice is only a part of a complex whole of society, a practice is a whole in itself in that it consists of a number of different kinds of parts. Economic practice, for example, contains raw materials, tools, individual persons, etc., all united in a process of production.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} in the series many times that regeneration is not guaranteed and can fail. After his cellular structure is decimated by the Metabelis crystals in Planet of the Spiders, the Third Doctor's regeneration requires [...] "a little push" [...] from fellow Time Lord K'anpo Rimpoche before it can proceed. As he succumbs to spectrox toxaemia in The Caves of Androzani, the Fifth Doctor says, [...] "I might regenerate... I don't know... It feels different this time...". He then hallucinates, seeing his former companions encouraging him to survive, before the Master overwhelms them all, telling him he must die. The 1996 TV movie showed the Doctor's regeneration delayed {{for more than three}} hours, with the Eighth Doctor later remarking that the fact his Seventh incarnation was under anaesthesia {{at the time of his}} [...] "death" [...] could have [...] "destroyed the regenerative process", and that he was [...] "dead too long this time" [...] prior to his regeneration. In many episodes, the Doctor doubts his own survival, though it is not always clear whether such statements refer to the death of only that particular incarnation. (The only time he makes a completely unambiguous distinction between these two scenarios – in The End of Time – he makes it clear that he regards regeneration as nearly as bad as death, because <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it,</b> he dies and [...] "a new man" [...] walks away). In The Mind of Evil the Master points a conventional firearm at the Doctor and threatens to [...] "put a bullet through both [...] hearts," [...] while in [...] "Forest of the Dead", Professor Song warns that electrocution would stop both the Time Lord's hearts, killing him. In [...] "Turn Left", in which the Tenth Doctor dies in a parallel world, a UNIT member speculates that what happened to the Doctor [...] "must have happened too fast for him to regenerate" [...] (It is suggested that he drowned without his future companion Donna Noble there to inspire him to leave). In The End of Time, the Doctor explains to Wilfred Mott that if he is killed before the regeneration can start, then it will fail.|$|E
2500|$|In 1903, a {{controversy}} arose {{that would eventually}} lead to a significant event {{in the evolution of}} academic freedom in U.S. higher education. [...] This series of events is known as the [...] "Bassett Affair." [...] Popular professor John Spencer Bassett published an article in the South Atlantic Quarterly entitled [...] "Stirring Up the Fires of Race Antipathy" [...] in October 1903. [...] In the article, he spoke about improving race relations and gave praise to numerous African Americans. [...] Near the end of the article, he wrote [...] "...Booker T. Washington [...] the greatest man, save General Lee, born in the South in a hundred years..." [...] This led to an outpouring of anger from powerful Democratic party leaders as well as the media and public. [...] Many demanded that Bassett be fired and encouraged parents to take their children out of the university. Resulting from immense public pressure, Bassett offered his resignation if the Board of Trustees requested that he do so. [...] The Board of Trustees then held a meeting to decide the fate of Bassett. [...] In the end, they voted 18-7 not to accept the resignation citing academic freedom. [...] In their decision, they wrote, [...] "We are particularly unwilling to lend ourselves to any tendency to destroy or limit academic liberty, a tendency which has, within recent years, manifested itself in some conspicuous instances, and which has created a feeling of uneasiness for the welfare of American colleges [...] We cannot lend countenance to the degrading notion that professors in American colleges have not an equal liberty of thought and speech with all other Americans." [...] In 1905, President Theodore Roosevelt commended Trinity and Bassett's courageous stand for academic freedom while speaking to the university. [...] He told the school, [...] "You stand for Academic Freedom, for the right of private judgment, for a duty more incumbent upon the scholar than upon any other man, to tell the truth <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it,</b> to claim for himself and to give to others the largest liberty in seeking after the truth." ...|$|E
