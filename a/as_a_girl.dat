5|$|Cherry {{originally}} created Susan <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> {{next door}} archetype and {{intended for the}} character to provide an emotional anchor for the series. When developing the character, Cherry drew upon his personal experiences {{as well as those}} of single women in his life.

5|$|Little {{is known}} about Fortune's time in Wales, in part because {{throughout}} her life she was deliberately elusive when providing biographical details about herself. In later life she reported that {{from the age of}} four she had experienced visions of Atlantis, something which she believed were past life memories. The Firths were still in Llandudno in 1900, although by 1904 Fortune was living in Somerset, south-west England. That year, she authored a book of poetry, titled Violets, which was likely published by her family. It was reviewed in the May 1905 volume of The Girls' Room, in which it was accompanied by the only known photograph of Fortune <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl.</b> In 1906, her second book of poetry, More Violets, was published.|$|E
5|$|On June 16, 2016, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Dr. Langer and Legion Group Arts, young Italian researcher Giovanni Rapazzini de Buzzaccarini discovered a long-lost early work by Brooks at the Vittoriale in Gardone. Brooks had copied (Pietro di Cristoforo Vannucci 1450-1523) Perugino's Portrait of a Young Man at the Uffizi when she was a penniless art student in Rome. She painted the man because she thought he resembled herself <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl.</b> She later gave the painting to D'Annunzio as a joke when she refused to become his lover. D'Annunzio was in the tasteless habit—Romaine thought—of hanging pictures of his mistresses in a rogue's gallery. Buzzaccarini found this painting in the music room.|$|E

5|$|Zelda {{had a deep}} {{desire to}} develop a talent that was entirely her own, perhaps a {{reaction}} to Scott's fame and success as a writer.

50|$|Arja's name is {{a modern}} made-up Finnish name. It first appears in Eino Leino´s poem Arja and Selinä of 1916; but the Arja in the poem is a boy. The Finns soon decided that Arja was more {{suitable}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl's</b> name. The -a ending is of no significance: the Finnish language has no genders, not even for people. There is a Russian name, variously transliterated as Arija, Arja, and Ara, which is a variant of Ariadne. Arja was most popular <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl's</b> name between 1940 and 1965. Other famous Arjas from this period are Arja Saijonmaa (b. 1944), Arja Havakka (b. 1944), and Arja Sipola (b. 1956).|$|R
