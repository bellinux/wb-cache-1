5|$|Theophrastus {{writes that}} plants can grow spontaneously, from seed, or from {{vegetative}} {{parts of the}} plant. Plants with bulbs grow from those. Soil and climate influence growth. Some plants change into others unless care is taken, so bergamot turns into mint, and wheat turns into darnel. He reports that if celery is trodden after sowing, it will become curly, and that figs are the easiest trees to propagate, whereas date palms have to be grown from several seeds together, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>like</b> irrigation, dung, salt (at the age of one year) and being transplanted. Other kinds of palm have different habits and fruits. He notes that gall insects come out of wild figs and make the cultivated figs swell, which helps to prevent premature shedding of the fruit. The male spathe of the date palm is cut off and brought to the female, and its dust is shaken over the female tree to make it fruit.|$|E
25|$|After the {{revolution}} radicalized further and headed towards terror, Charlotte Corday began {{to sympathize with}} the Girondins. She admired their speeches and grew fond {{of many of the}} Girondist groups whom she met while living in Caen. She respected the political principles of the Girondins and came to align herself with their thinking. She regarded them as a movement that would ultimately save France. The Gironde represented a more moderate approach to {{the revolution}} <b>and</b> <b>they,</b> <b>like</b> Corday, were skeptical about the direction the revolution was taking. They opposed the Montagnards, who advocated a more radical approach to the revolution, which included the extreme idea that the only way the revolution would survive invasion and civil war was through terrorizing and executing those opposed to it. The opposition to this radical thinking, coupled with the influence of the Gironde, ultimately led Corday to carry out her plan to murder the most radical of them all, Jean-Paul Marat.|$|E
500|$|After {{working on}} their debut self-titled album, Whodini {{embarked}} on a three-month European tour. Two-and-a-half weeks into this tour, {{they were joined by}} Kangol Kid and UTFO. The group had also planned to tour in Israel and Australia following their European tour, but refused to do so, as they had been away from home for three weeks and found the tour [...] "rigorous". Singer-songwriter Jalil Hutchins later said, [...] "Somebody should've stepped in and made us [...]" [...] Whodini member John Fletcher (Ecstasy) said that the group thought European audiences would be unfamiliar with their music, but they [...] "found that lots of kids, lots of club owners, had made a real effort to get hold of our music. When we discovered that, we realized that the music we were working with really was universal, that we didn't have to think of a particular market. People everywhere like to dance, sweat and party, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>like</b> the same kind of sounds." ...|$|E

When promoting her book, Men Are Stupid ... <b>And</b> <b>They</b> <b>Like</b> Big Boobs: A Woman's Guide to Beauty Through Plastic Surgery, described by The New York Times Magazine as [...] "a detailed and mostly serious guide to eye lifts, tummy tucks and other forms of plastic surgery", she quipped: [...] "I've had so much plastic surgery, when I die they will donate my body to Tupperware." ...|$|E

Shilphy is a probationary sister at a church run by her parents, and she handles the church alone because her parents are away on propagation.

2500|$|Zach Whalen {{described}} the show's presentation of retro gaming into contemporary gamers as [...] "a process of {{looking back to}} an unattainable past and trying to bring that past into the present". Indeed, Rolfe also commented during an interview with The Guardian of the show's impact in {{the current generation of}} the video game industry, saying that they [...] "still relate to it <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>like</b> learning of the past". In the same article, reporter Luke Langlands also noted the show's influence of inspiring the creation of other independent online shows. The Nerd's success as an independent celebrity outside of the commercial mainstream of pop culture, popularized the notion of making lifelong careers online. In a survey published by Mediscape, a number of people admitted to being inspired by the Nerd to create and submit their own content in various online spaces, including YouTube, DeviantArt, SourceForge, GameFAQs and ScrewAttack. WatchMojo also called the Nerd as a [...] "trendsetter" [...] for other gamers and amateur reviewers online, influencing the likes of those such as the Nostalgia Critic, Angry Joe and others.|$|E

2500|$|The {{policy on}} both sides was to {{minimize}} the role of nonwhites but the need for manpower continuously stretched those resolves. [...] At the battle of Spion Kop in Ladysmith, MK Gandhi with 300 freeburger Indians and 800 Indentured Indian labourers started the Ambulance Corps. These Indian stretcher bearers saved British lives. But for the opposition side the war raged across their farms and their homes were destroyed, many Africans became refugees <b>and</b> <b>they,</b> <b>like</b> the Boers, moved to the towns where the British hastily created internment camps. Subsequently, the [...] "Scorched Earth" [...] policy was ruthlessly applied to both Boers and Africans. Although most black Africans were not considered by the British to be hostile, many tens of thousands were also forcibly removed from Boer areas and also placed in concentration camps. Africans were held separately from Boer internees. Eventually there were a total of 64 tented camps for Africans. Conditions were as bad as in the camps for the Boers, but even though, after the Fawcett Commission report, conditions improved in the Boer camps, [...] "improvements were much slower in coming to the black camps." [...] 20,000 died there.|$|E

40|$|Two studies {{assessed}} predictions from sociocognitive theory (SCT, Aboud, 1988) {{and social}} identity development theory (SIDT, Nesdale, 1999 a) concerning {{the development of}} children’s ethnic prejudice, with 8, 10 and 12 year old Anglo-Australian children participating in the first study, and 6, 9 and 12 year olds participating in the second study. In both studies, the children listened to a story about an ingroup Australian boy and an outgroup Vietnamese (Study 1) /Chinese boy (Study 2) who displayed equal numbers of stereotype-consistent (Study 1) /positive traits (Study 2) and stereotype-inconsistent (Study 1) /negative traits (Study 2). The results of the two studies revealed that, as they increased in age, the children remembered more of the ingroup character’s stereotype-inconsistent/negative traits versus stereotype-consistent/positive traits, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>liked</b> him less. In contrast, with increasing age, the children remembered more of the outgroup character’s stereotype-consistent/positive traits versus stereotype-inconsistent/negative traits <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>liked</b> him more.
