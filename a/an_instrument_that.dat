5|$|The cornett {{used in the}} cantata was <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>that</b> {{belonged to}} an earlier age: by {{the second quarter of}} the 18th century it had almost entirely {{disappeared}} from Bach's compositions.|$|E
5|$|Though regular 6-string {{acoustic}} {{guitars and}} electric bass guitar {{was used in}} the original studio recording of the song, in the music video, in keeping with the turn-of-the-century theme, some interesting instruments were used as 'props'; James Iha can be seen using a Gibson harp guitar and D'arcy Wretzky is seen playing <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>that</b> resembles the 1924 Gibson mandobass.|$|E
5|$|The {{city also}} has three {{established}} music venues: the Guildhall, The Wedgewood Rooms (which includes a smaller venue, Edge of the Wedge), and Portsmouth Pyramids Centre. Portsmouth Guildhall, another theatrical venue, {{is one of}} the largest events venue in South East England, with a seating capacity of 2500. For many years a series of symphony concerts has been presented at the Guildhall by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. In the 1970s the Portsmouth Sinfonia approached classical music from a different angle: the Sinfonia often recruited players that had no musical training or, if they were musicians, ones that chose to play <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>that</b> was entirely new to them. The Portsmouth Summer Show is held at King George's Fields. The 2016 event was held in the last weekend of April, and featured cover bands such as the Silver Beatles, the Bog Rolling Stones, and Fleetingwood Mac.|$|E

5|$|The marine {{engineer}} and amateur historian Anders Franzén had searched for old Swedish wrecks in the Baltic since the 1940s and became nationally renowned after he located Vasa in 1956. Kronan {{was one of}} several famous shipwrecks on a list of potential wreck sites that he had compiled. For almost 30 years Franzén and others scoured archives and probed the seabed off the west coast of Öland. During the 1950s and 1960s the team searched off Hulterstad by dragging, and later followed up with sonar scans. In 1971 planks believed to belong to Kronan were located, but the lead could not be followed up properly at the time. Later in the 1970s the search area was narrowed down with a sidescan sonar and a magnometer, <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>that</b> detects the presence of iron. With the two instruments the team pinned down a likely location, and in early August 1980, sent down underwater cameras to reveal the first pictures of Kronan.|$|E

25|$|Tchaikovsky's score {{has become}} one of his most famous compositions, in {{particular}} the pieces featured in the suite.

25|$|In 1818 Gauss, {{putting his}} {{calculation}} skills to practical use, {{carried out a}} geodetic survey of the Kingdom of Hanover, linking up with previous Danish surveys. To aid the survey, Gauss invented the heliotrope, <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>that</b> uses a mirror to reflect sunlight over great distances, to measure positions.|$|E
25|$|A {{practical}} {{application of the}} Coriolis effect is the mass flow meter, <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>that</b> measures the mass flow rate and density of a fluid flowing through a tube. The operating principle involves inducing a vibration of the tube through which the fluid passes. The vibration, though not completely circular, provides the rotating reference frame that {{gives rise to the}} Coriolis effect. While specific methods vary according to the design of the flow meter, sensors monitor and analyze changes in frequency, phase shift, and amplitude of the vibrating flow tubes. The changes observed represent the mass flow rate and density of the fluid.|$|E
25|$|The {{new style}} {{can be heard}} in the series of works called Kammermusik (Chamber Music) from 1922 to 1927. Each of these pieces is written for a {{different}} small instrumental ensemble, many of them very unusual. Kammermusik No. 6, for example, is a concerto for the viola d'amore, <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>that</b> has not been in wide use since the baroque period, but which Hindemith himself played. He continued to write for unusual groups of instruments throughout his life, producing a trio for viola, heckelphone and piano (1928), 7 trios for 3 trautoniums (1930), a sonata for double bass and a concerto for trumpet, bassoon, and strings (both in 1949), for example.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s, {{the noble}} gases neon and xenon were {{discovered}} to have unusual isotopic ratios in primitive meteorites. Their origin {{and the type}} of matter that contained them was a mystery. These discoveries were made by vaporizing a bulk sample of a meteorite within a mass spectrometer, <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>that</b> is able to count the relative abundances of the isotopes of noble gases that are trapped in the meteorite sample. During the 1970s similar mass spectrometers discovered more components of trapped xenon isotopes. Competing speculations about the origins of the xenon isotopic components were advanced, all within the existing paradigm that the variations were created by processes within an initially homogeneous solar gas cloud.|$|E
25|$|German Orientalist, mathematician, inventor, poet, and {{librarian}} Daniel Schwenter {{wrote in}} his 1636 book Deliciae Physico-Mathematicae about <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>that</b> a man from Pappenheim had shown him, which enabled movement of a lens to project more from a scene through the camera obscura. It consisted of a ball {{as big as a}} fist, through which a hole (AB) was made with a lens attached on one side (B). This ball was placed inside two halves of part of a hollow ball that were then glued together (CD), in which it could be turned around. This device was attached to a wall of the camera obscura (EF). This universal joint mechanism was later called a scioptric ball.|$|E
25|$|Not to be {{confused}} with an earlier and different invention with the same name, a polygraph, popularly referred to as a lie detector, is <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>that</b> measures and records several physiological indices such as blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and skin conductivity while the subject is asked and answers a series of questions, in the belief that deceptive answers will produce physiological responses that can be differentiated from those associated with non-deceptive answers. The polygraph was invented in 1921 by John Augustus Larson, a medical student at the University of California at Berkeley and a police officer of the Berkeley Police Department in Berkeley, California. According to Encyclopædia Britannica, the polygraph was on its 2003 list of the 325 greatest inventions.|$|E
