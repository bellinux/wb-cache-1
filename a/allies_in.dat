5|$|After the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan {{fell to the}} Spanish in 1521, the Kaqchikel Maya of Iximche sent envoys to Hernán Cortés {{to declare}} their {{allegiance}} to the new ruler of Mexico, and the K'iche' Maya of Q'umarkaj may also have sent a delegation. In 1522 Cortés sent Mexican allies to scout the Soconusco region of lowland Chiapas, where they met new delegations from Iximche and Q'umarkaj at Tuxpán; both of the powerful highland Maya kingdoms declared their loyalty to the King of Spain. But Cortés' <b>allies</b> <b>in</b> Soconusco soon informed him that the K'iche' and the Kaqchikel were not loyal, and were harassing Spain's <b>allies</b> <b>in</b> the region. Cortés despatched Pedro de Alvarado with 180 cavalry, 300 infantry, 4 cannons, and thousands of allied warriors from central Mexico; they arrived in Soconusco in 1523.|$|E
5|$|After the Imperial Japanese Navy's {{attacks on}} the <b>Allies</b> <b>in</b> December 1941, the RAN redeployed its larger ships to home waters, to protect the Australian {{mainland}} from Japanese attack, while several smaller ships remained in the Mediterranean. From 1940 onwards, there was considerable Axis naval activity in Australian waters first from German commerce raiders and submarines and later by the Imperial Japanese Navy.|$|E
5|$|Aristagoras {{had brought}} all of Hellenic Asia Minor into revolt, but evidently {{realised}} that the Greeks would need other <b>allies</b> <b>in</b> order to successfully fight the Persians. In {{the winter of}} 499 BC, he first sailed to Sparta, the pre-eminent Greek state in matters of war. However, despite Aristagoras's entreaties, the Spartan king Cleomenes I turned down the offer to lead the Greeks against the Persians. Aristagoras therefore turned instead to Athens.|$|E

5|$|As the United States was {{initiating}} the Marshall Plan, Kennan and the Truman administration {{hoped that the}} Soviet Union's rejection of Marshall aid would strain its relations with its Communist <b>allies</b> <b>in</b> Eastern Europe. Kennan initiated a series of efforts to exploit the schism between the Soviets and Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslavia. Kennan proposed conducting covert action in the Balkans to further decrease Moscow's influence.|$|E
5|$|Despite Clarke and Wavell's {{successes in}} deception, the North African {{campaign}} was turning against the <b>Allies.</b> <b>In</b> 1941 Erwin Rommel had taken command of Axis forces and won early victories. Churchill replaced Wavell with Claude Auchinleck. Clarke's new commander {{was impressed with}} Wavell's setup, so 'A' Force {{and the rest of}} Middle Eastern Command continued to operate as before.|$|E
5|$|During secret {{surrender}} {{negotiations with}} the <b>Allies</b> <b>in</b> early September, the Italian government offered to open the ports of Taranto and Brindisi on the eastern coast.

Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean, quickly planned a third landing, codenamed Slapstick, {{to take advantage of the}} offer.|$|E
