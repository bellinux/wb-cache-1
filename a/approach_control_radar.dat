50|$|To improve {{air traffic}} control, {{which would be}} {{critical}} {{as the number of}} flights grew, the newly developed Ground <b>Controlled</b> <b>Approach</b> <b>radar</b> system (GCA) was flown to Europe for installation at Tempelhof, with a second set installed at Fassberg in the British Zone in West Germany. With the installation of GCA, all-weather airlift operations were assured.|$|R
50|$|Shortly after V-J Day, September 1945, Magruder {{became the}} {{commanding}} officer of Marine Aircraft Group 53 (a fully integrated Night Fighter Command) at Marine Corps Air Station Eagle Mountain Lake, Texas. The group consisted of seven tactical squadrons, one service and support squadron, one headquarters squadron, one ground <b>control</b> <b>radar</b> squadron and one ground <b>control</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radar</b> unit. This totalled nearly 2400 officers and men with 146 aircraft. At the time this was the largest aircraft group in Marine Aviation. In February 1946, MAG-53 moved operations back to MCAS Cherry Point. In August 1946 Magruder assumed command of Marine Aircraft Group 31.|$|R

50|$|Punta Cana's airport {{operators}} completed an airport expansion project in November 2011, {{which included a}} new runway, a control tower equipped with modern radio and air traffic control equipment. Additionally, {{there is a new}} Terminal <b>Approach</b> <b>Radar</b> <b>Control</b> facility and a new Automated Weather Observation Station (AWOS). This new facility also provides a back-up to the National Radar System located in Santo Domingo. A second international terminal which opened in 2014 is designed to accommodate about 6,500 passengers daily.|$|R
5000|$|Adjacent to the {{entrance}} to Bournemouth Airport was the College of Air Traffic Control, operated by NATS, the now privatised provider of air traffic control services in the UK. Established by the Ministry of Civil Aviation as the School of Air Traffic Control in 1949, the establishment was retitled College in 1962. [...] Students from home and abroad were trained {{in all aspects of}} ATC operations and went on to work throughout the world. Electronic computer-based ATC simulators were widely employed. Usefully situated at an operational airfield, for a considerable period training in <b>Approach</b> <b>Radar</b> <b>Control</b> was facilitated by the airport ATC unit. Students were able to practise live <b>radar</b> <b>control</b> exercises using temporarily detached Civil Aviation Flying Unit Dove aircraft as live targets. The building was also the home to the Air Traffic Control Evaluation Unit, responsible for developing technology used within the service.|$|R
2500|$|... 23 June 1953: Shortly after {{a ground}} <b>control</b> <b>approached</b> (GCA) <b>radar</b> {{monitored}} takeoff from Ashiya Air Base, Japan, a U.S. Air Force C-119 Flying Boxcar (AF Ser. No. 49-0161) {{turned to a}} heading 005 degrees magnetic (dm) and began a normal climb through the overcast. The pilot then reported that the C-119 may have scraped the tail skid on takeoff; additionally all the left seat (pilot side) gyroscopic instruments (Gyros) were not operational. A few seconds later, the pilot requested immediate GCA vector to Ashiya AB, stating that co-pilot would have to fly the GCA approach from the right seat. The GCA was continuously tracking them and reported its location as 12miles north of Ashiya AB, instructing co-pilot to turn right to a heading of 210 degrees. Then 49-161 disappeared from radar. All on board were lost ...|$|R
50|$|Faisalabad airport's {{control tower}} {{stands at the}} centre of the airfield. It was built soon after the jet {{aircraft}} flights were inaugurated at the airport in 1974. Pakistan's airspace is split into two FIR regions, Karachi and Lahore. The airport falls under Lahore's Flight Information Region. Air traffic control is provided by the Civil Aviation Authority of Pakistan (CAA) and is governed by the Lahore Area Control Centre. Faisalabad airport also has its own aerodome and <b>approach</b> <b>control</b> <b>radar</b> systems providing services to both civilian and military aircraft. Navigation aid facilities include Non Directional Beacon (NDB), Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) and Instrument Landing System (ILS) which are all in operation at the airport.|$|E
5000|$|On March 5, 1969 Prinair Flight 277 {{departed}} Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands for {{a flight}} to San Juan. Seventeen minutes after take-off, the crew contacted San Juan Approach Control. The approach controller on duty (a trainee) replied; [...] "Prinair Two Seven Seven, San Juan <b>Approach</b> <b>Control,</b> <b>radar</b> contact three miles east of Isla Verde...maintain four thousand." [...] The aircraft was actually three {{miles east of the}} Fajardo waypoint instead of the Isla Verde waypoint (which is located about 10 miles west of the Fajardo waypoint). Six minutes later the aircraft crashed in the Sierra de Luquillo mountains at an elevation of about 2400 feet; all 19 occupants were killed. The accident investigation found that Air Traffic Control was to blame.|$|E
5000|$|Then, the airport's {{approach}} controller responded [...] "Prinair two seven seven San Juan <b>Approach</b> <b>Control</b> <b>radar</b> contact three {{miles east of}} Isla Verde fly a heading of two five zero for a vector to ILS final maintain four thousand." [...] The {{approach controller}}, who was a trainee on the fateful afternoon, mistakenly thought that Prinair Flight 277 was near San Juan, but it was instead near Luquillo at what is described as the [...] "Fajardo intersection". One minute after this communication, Prinair Flight 277 was asked to go to flight level 3, or 3,000 ft and prepare for landing. The airplane was vectored for a landing into runway 7. The plane's pilots, trusting that the information given to them was correct, followed the instructions and prepared for landing, soon finding themselves {{in front of an}} unavoidable mountain instead. At 5:38 pm, 23 minutes after the flight took off from St. Thomas, it crashed into some trees at Sierra Luquillo mountains, killing everyone on board.|$|E
50|$|Two lesser-known key {{systems were}} used at {{airports}} for {{air traffic control}} communications, the 102 and 302 key systems. These were uniquely designed for communications between the air traffic <b>control</b> tower and <b>radar</b> <b>approach</b> <b>control</b> (RAPCON) or ground <b>control</b> <b>approach</b> (GCA), and included radio line connections.|$|R
