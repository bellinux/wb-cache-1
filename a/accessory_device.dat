When this happens, the headlamps burn steadily.|$|E
50|$|The AppleCD SC was {{the first}} CD-ROM by Apple Computer Company, {{introduced}} in 1988.

40|$|Class of 2012 AbstractSpecific Aims: To {{evaluate}} the in vitro throat deposition and respirable {{mass of the}} QVAR® pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) alone or coupled to an <b>accessory</b> <b>device,</b> such as the AeroChamber Valved Holding ChamberTM or various nonconventional accessory devices. Methods: The performance of the AeroChamber and nonconventional accessory devices, including a toilet paper roll, paper towel roll, rolled paper, plastic bottle spacer, plastic bottle reverse-flow holding chamber, and nebulizer reservoir tubing, were compared to no <b>accessory</b> <b>device.</b> Throat deposition and respirable mass were evaluated using a United States Pharmacopeia (USP) inlet ("throat") coupled to instrumentation for particle size analysis. Each configuration was tested with three actuations and repeated in quadruplicate. The amount of drug deposition was quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. The {{data were analyzed using}} multiple independent t-tests assuming unequal variances. An a priori α-threshold of 0. 05 was used with a Bonferroni corrected α of 0. 007. Main Results: Compared to the pMDI alone, all of the accessory devices had significantly lower throat deposition (p < 0. 001) and significantly higher respirable fraction (p < 0. 001). Differences in respirable mass were not significant for any <b>accessory</b> <b>device</b> (p ≥ 0. 049), except the paper towel roll and the nebulizer reservoir tubing (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: Under these testing circumstances, nonconventional accessory devices, such as the toilet paper roll, rolled paper, plastic bottle spacer, and plastic bottle reverse-flow holding chamber, effectively reduce throat deposition and maintain respirable mass compared to a QVAR pMDI alone. Therefore, they may be suitable alternatives to commercial spacers...|$|E

40|$|The Heidelberg retina angiograph (HRA) classic enables {{fluorescein}} angiography (FA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICG-A) of {{the retina}} and choroid. The {{goal of this}} study was to design an <b>accessory</b> <b>device</b> to adapt the HRA classic for application on structures anterior to the retina. The optical device consisted of a cylindrical two-piece plastic frame holding a magnifying lens commonly used with the indirect ophthalmoscope. A 60 -diopters lens was inserted in this frame to enable the angiography of the anterior segment. A less strong lens of 30 diopters was used for the visualization of pathologic findings in the vitreous cavity. We designed an easy-to-use and low-cost device to adapt the HRA classic for angiography of the fundus, vitreous cavity and anterior segment in the same session and without delay. FA and ICG-A images of two patients with rubeosis iridis and of one patient with choroidal melanoma are described...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Neurologically, it {{is proven}} that {{stimulation}} of larger diameter fibers - e. g. using appropriate coldness, warmth, rubbing, pressure or vibration- can close the neural "gate" so that the central perception of itch and pain is reduced. This fact is based upon "Gate-control" theory of Melzack and Wall. Presentation of the hypothesis Syringe Micro Vibrator is a new design being introduced {{for the first time}} in the field of Dentistry. This device is a promising breakthrough in pain and anxiety management and may deliver solution for clinicians plagued with patient pain phobia. It has an off-set rotating micro vibration creator with ultra high frequency and ultra low altitude that can be easily placed on any standard dental syringe and some disposable syringes. This device was registered as an invention in dentistry and received Iran National Patent number of 63765. Testing the hypothesis By creating micro vibration, this device would be effective in reducing the pain and anxiety confronted with most types of intraoral injections as palatal, mandibular block, intraligamental and local infiltration. From the aspect of the patient pain management, this device contributes both physiologically (based on Gate Control Theory of pain) and psychologically (based on the device function as will be explained by dentist to the patient as a modern pain reducing technology). From the aspect of clinician, SMV motor provides vibrations with ultra high frequency to alleviate pain, but since it has ultra low vibration altitude, it has no adverse effect on the clinician dexterity and accuracy during injection and it does not interfere with pin point localization of injection site. Implications of the hypothesis Upon mounting on a conventional dental anesthesia injection syringe, SMV is switched on and the clinician then uses normal injection technique to administer the anesthetic. This device is not only a useful <b>accessory</b> <b>device</b> for ordinary patients, but also more useful for pediatric patients and those who have a phobia of intraoral injection or pain. </p...|$|E
