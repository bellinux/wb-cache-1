25|$|On June 10, 2016, Eisley {{revealed}} {{that they had}} begun the process of recording their fifth studio record {{with the assistance of}} producer Will Yip at the band's own studio in Tyler {{at the beginning of the}} month. DuPree-Bemis spoke of the new album in the band's press release, mentioning that, “Musically, you could say it’s classic Eisley, in the sense that it’s melodic, moody pop and is written from the heart. Lyrically, it’s very whimsical; it has a vibe that will take you into its own world <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> escape your normal life for a few minutes. I like to cloak things in a little mystery and romance; I think it’s part of what makes all of Eisley’s songs sound like they’re from the same world. Every record is like opening and reading a book in a series.” Tracking for the album concluded in early July, with mention of plans to release the record in early 2017.|$|E

500|$|In June 2008, Warner Bros. took pitches from {{comic book}} writers, screenwriters and {{directors}} {{on how to}} successfully restart the Superman film series. Comic book writers Grant Morrison, Mark Waid, Geoff Johns and Brad Meltzer were among those who pitched their ideas for a reboot. [...] "I told them, it’s not that bad. Just treat Superman Returns as the Ang Lee Hulk," [...] Morrison said. [...] "The Incredible Hulk has proven the audience will forgive you <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> redo the franchise," [...] said Waid. Morrison's idea was similar to his work on All-Star Superman, while Waid's was akin to [...] Mark Millar, teaming with director Matthew Vaughn, also planned an epic eight-hour Superman trilogy, each installment released a year apart, similar to The Lord of the Rings. Millar compared it to the Godfather trilogy, in which it would chronicle the entire life of Superman, {{from the early days}} of Krypton to the finale where Superman loses his powers as the Sun starts to go supernova.|$|E

500|$|Barton {{does not}} believe Hollywood offers the same opportunity. In the film, Los Angeles {{is a world of}} false fronts and phony people. This is evident in an early line of the {{screenplay}} (filmed, but not included in the theatrical release); while informing Barton of Capitol Pictures' offer, his agent tells him: [...] "I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism– [...] if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath". Later, as Barton tries to explain why he's staying at the Earle, studio head Jack Lipnick finishes his sentence, recognizing that Barton wants a place that is [...] "less Hollywood". The assumption is that Hollywood is fake and the Earle is genuine. Producer Ben Geisler takes Barton to lunch at a restaurant featuring a mural of the [...] "New York Cafe", a sign of Hollywood's effort to replicate the authenticity of the East Coast. Lipnick's initial overwhelming exuberance is also a façade. Although he begins by telling Barton: [...] "The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures", in the penultimate scene he insists: [...] "If your opinion mattered, then I guess I'd resign <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> run the studio. It doesn't, and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run this particular asylum".|$|E
2500|$|Though {{silent and}} {{reserved}} in public, Wheatstone {{was a clear}} and voluble talker in private, if taken on his favourite studies, and his small but active person, his plain but intelligent countenance, was full of animation. Sir Henry Taylor tells us that he once observed Wheatstone at an evening party in Oxford earnestly holding forth to Lord Palmerston on the capabilities of his telegraph. 'You don't say so!' exclaimed the statesman. 'I must get you to {{tell that to the}} Lord Chancellor.' And so saying, he fastened the electrician on Lord Westbury, and effected his escape. A reminiscence of this interview may have prompted Palmerston to remark that a time was coming when a minister might be asked in Parliament if war had broken out in India, and would reply, 'Wait a minute; I'll just telegraph to the Governor-General, <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> know.' ...|$|E

[...] Barbara Lesko wrote, [...] "She was a great help to Egyptian scholars, especially Hassan and Fakhry, correcting their English and writing English language articles for others. So this poorly educated Englishwoman developed in Egypt into a first rate draughtswoman and prolific and talented writer who, even under her own name, produced articles, essays, monographs and books of great range, wit and substance." [...] William Golding wrote of the Egyptologists he met in his travels through Egypt in the 1980s who were [...] "as well disposed to the Mystery as any child could have wished." [...] When [...] "the question arose of a dear lady who believed herself to have been a priestess of a particular temple, they did not dismiss her as a crackpot but agreed that she had something." ...|$|E

2500|$|Western RPGs {{have also}} {{received}} criticism in recent years. They remain less popular in Japan, where, until recently, Western games in general {{had a negative}} reputation. In Japan, where {{the vast majority of}} early console role-playing video games originate, Western RPGs remain largely unknown. [...] The developer Motomu Toriyama criticized Western RPGs, stating that they [...] "dump you in a big open world, <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> do whatever you like [...] difficult to tell a compelling story." [...] Hironobu Sakaguchi noted that [...] "users like to categorise" [...] Western RPGs as [...] "a sort of different style, born from first person shooters." [...] In recent years, some have also criticized Western RPGs for becoming less RPG-like, instead with further emphasis on action Christian Nutt of GameSpy states that, in contrast to Japanese RPGs, Western RPGs' greater control over the development and customization of playable characters has {{come at the expense of}} plot and gameplay, resulting in what he felt was generic dialogue, lack of character development within the narrative and weaker battle systems. He also states that Western RPGs tend to focus more on the underlying rules governing the battle system rather than on the experience itself. Tom Battey of Edge Magazine noted that the problems often cited against Japanese RPGs (mentioned above) also often apply to many Western RPGs as well as games outside of the RPG genre. BioWare games have been criticized for [...] "lack of innovation, repetitive structure and lack of real choice." [...] Western RPGs, such as Bethesda games, have also been criticized for lacking in [...] "narrative strength" [...] or [...] "mechanical intricacy" [...] due to the open-ended, sandbox structure of their games.|$|E
