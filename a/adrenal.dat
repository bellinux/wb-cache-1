5|$|<b>Adrenal</b> {{insufficiency}} (the {{deficiency of}} glucocorticoids) occurs in about 5 in 10,000 {{in the general}} population. Diseases classified as primary <b>adrenal</b> insufficiency (including Addison's disease and genetic causes) directly affect the <b>adrenal</b> cortex. If a problem that affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis arises outside the gland, it is a secondary <b>adrenal</b> insufficiency.|$|E
5|$|A {{complication}} seen in untreated Addison's {{disease and}} other types of primary <b>adrenal</b> insufficiency is the <b>adrenal</b> crisis, a medical emergency in which low glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid levels result in hypovolemic shock and symptoms such as vomiting and fever. An <b>adrenal</b> crisis can progressively lead to stupor and coma. The management of <b>adrenal</b> crises includes the application of hydrocortisone injections.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{endocrine}} diseases involve dysfunctions of the <b>adrenal</b> gland. Overproduction of cortisol leads to Cushing's syndrome, whereas insufficient production {{is associated with}} Addison's disease. Congenital <b>adrenal</b> hyperplasia is a genetic disease produced by dysregulation of endocrine control mechanisms. A variety of tumors can arise from <b>adrenal</b> tissue and are commonly found in medical imaging when searching for other diseases.|$|E
25|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that the mean percent methylation of H19 CpGs at sites 13 and 14, after the transcription start site, is insignificant between normal, hyperplasia, adenoma and carcinoma <b>adrenals.</b> This is because methylation of CpGs after the transcription start site is assumed to interfere with RNA polymerase II during transcription. Another point of interest is the significant difference in CpG methylation at site 11 between normal and hyperplasia <b>adrenals.</b> The mean percent CpG methylation at site 11 for hyperplasia and adenoma <b>adrenals</b> is significantly different from that of normal <b>adrenals</b> and carcinoma <b>adrenals,</b> leading Gao et al. to suggest that site 11 is the initial methylated CpG that eventually leads to widespread methylation of the H19 promoter.|$|R
40|$|Gross and histomorphological {{features}} of fetal and adult <b>adrenals</b> obtained from slaughtered Kano brown goats at Obollo Afor and Nsukka abattoirs were studied. The specimens {{were divided into}} groups A – D for gestation day (GD) 86 - 102, 103 - 124, 125 – 146 and adults respectively. The mass of the <b>adrenals</b> increased significantly with age. Microscopically, GD 86 – 102 <b>adrenals</b> comprised outer capsule, definitive zone (DZ), fetal zone (FZ) and medulla. By GD 103 – 124 they exhibited transitional zone with less dense packed cells when compared with outer defi nitive zone. Full term <b>adrenals</b> had definitive cortex with zona granulosa at the early formative stage. The adult <b>adrenals</b> exhibited structures with typical zonation of the cortex. The width of DC increased while that of FZ decreased significantly (P < 0. 01) with increasing age of the fetuses.

5|$|Congenital <b>adrenal</b> {{hyperplasia}} is a congenital {{disease in}} which mutations of enzymes that produce steroid hormones {{result in a}} glucocorticoid deficiency and malfunction of the negative feedback loop of the HPA axis. In the HPA axis, cortisol (a glucocorticoid) inhibits the release of CRH and ACTH, hormones that in turn stimulate corticosteroid synthesis. As cortisol cannot be synthesized, these hormones are released in high quantities and stimulate production of other <b>adrenal</b> steroids instead. The {{most common form of}} congenital <b>adrenal</b> hyperplasia is due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. 21-hydroxylase is necessary for production of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, but not androgens. Therefore, ACTH stimulation of the <b>adrenal</b> cortex induces the release of excessive amounts of <b>adrenal</b> androgens, which can lead to the development of ambiguous genitalia and secondary sex characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Each <b>adrenal</b> gland has two {{distinct}} parts, {{each with a}} unique function, the outer <b>adrenal</b> cortex and the inner medulla, both of which produce hormones.|$|E
5|$|In {{secondary}} <b>adrenal</b> insufficiency, a dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis {{leads to}} decreased {{stimulation of the}} <b>adrenal</b> cortex. Apart from suppression of the axis by glucocorticoid therapy, {{the most common cause}} of secondary <b>adrenal</b> insufficiency are tumors that affect the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary gland. This type of <b>adrenal</b> insufficiency usually does not affect the production of mineralocorticoids, which are under regulation of the renin-angiotensin system instead.|$|E

The total cholesterol of the lungs, liver, heart, kidneys and brain, and the total and ester cholesterol of the <b>adrenals</b> were measured by a modification of Bloor's method. The following results were obtained: 1) Single bath: The concentration of the total cholesterol of these organs and the ester cholesterol of <b>adrenals</b> decreased for two hours after a radioactive "Hisui-no-Yu" bath, but such decrease was recognised only in the heart, brain, <b>adrenals</b> after a weak radioactive "Kenkyusho-sen". 2) A series of baths: The concentration of the total cholesterol of the lungs, heart, brain, <b>adrenals</b> and the ester cholesterol of <b>adrenals</b> decreased {{after a series of}} "Hisui-no-Yu" baths for 4 weeks. 3) A series of baths in cholesterol fed rats: The concentration of the total cholesterol of the above mentioned organs and the ester cholesterol of the <b>adrenals</b> in the bathing group remained decreased during the experiment comparing with the control group...|$|R
25|$|In {{contrast}} to most other cancers, adrenocortical neoplasms {{appear to have}} decreased expression of H19. To determine a possible cause for the downregulation of H19, Gao et al. studied the methylation of 12 CpG sites in the H19 promoter in normal, hyperplasia, adenoma and carcinoma <b>adrenals.</b> They found that in carcinomas, there was more methylation of CpGs than in normal, hyperplasia and adenoma <b>adrenals.</b> Consequently, normal H19 expression was detectable in normal and hyperplasia <b>adrenals,</b> but in carcinomas and surprisingly, adenomas, there was a lower H19 expression that was coupled with detectable (increased) IGF2 expression.|$|R
40|$|Primary hyperaldosteronism is a {{clinical}} syndrome {{characterized by an}} elevated aldosterone secretion by the <b>adrenals.</b> The present case series describes 7 cats with primary hyperaldosteronism, which were presented between 2002 and 2011. Common clinical symptoms were weakness, anorexia, cervical ventroflexion and blindness. All cats showed hypokalemia. In 6 cats, blood pressure was determined: 5 cats showed hypertension, of which 4 animals exhibited retinal detachment and blindness. In the ultrasonographic examination, unilateral adrenomegaly was present in 6 cats whereas one animal showed normal <b>adrenals.</b> In 4 cats, the serum aldosterone concentration was above the reference range. Five cats underwent unilateral adrenalectomy, which was accomplished uneventfully and returned the electrolytes back to normal.

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{recognized}} works on the <b>adrenal</b> glands came in 1855 {{with the publication of}} On the Constitutional and Local Effects of Disease of the Suprarenal Capsule, by the English physician Thomas Addison. In his monography, Addison described what the French physician George Trousseau would later name Addison's disease, an eponym still used today for a condition of <b>adrenal</b> insufficiency and its related clinical manifestations. In 1894, English physiologists George Oliver and Edward Schafer studied the action of <b>adrenal</b> extracts and observed their pressor effects. In the following decades several physicians experimented with extracts from the <b>adrenal</b> cortex to treat Addison's disease. Edward Calvin Kendall, Philip Hench and Tadeusz Reichstein were then awarded the 1950 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries on the structure and effects of the <b>adrenal</b> hormones.|$|E
5|$|The <b>adrenal</b> medulla is at {{the centre}} of each <b>adrenal</b> gland, and is {{surrounded}} by the <b>adrenal</b> cortex. The chromaffin cells of the medulla are the body's main source of the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline, released by the medulla. Approximately 20% noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and 80% adrenaline (epinephrine) are secreted here.|$|E
5|$|The <b>adrenal</b> medulla {{is driven}} by the {{sympathetic}} nervous system via preganglionic fibers originating in the thoracic spinal cord, from vertebrae T5–T11. Because it is innervated by preganglionic nerve fibers, the <b>adrenal</b> medulla can be considered as a specialized sympathetic ganglion. Unlike other sympathetic ganglia, however, the <b>adrenal</b> medulla lacks distinct synapses and releases its secretions directly into the blood.|$|E
40|$|<b>Adrenals</b> {{express a}} high level of neutral cholesteryl ester {{hydrolase}} (CEH) activity, and male rats have greater activity than females; however, the identity of the enzyme(s) responsible for this activity and the basis for the sex differences are unknown. Using mice in which hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) was inactivated by homologous recombination (HSL �/�), neutral CEH activity was reduced more than 98 % compared with controls. Female HSL �/ � mice showed a reduction in stimulated corticosterone values. Mechanical separation of rat <b>adrenals</b> revealed less HSL in the outer than the inner cortex.

5|$|The <b>adrenal</b> glands (also {{known as}} suprarenal glands) are {{endocrine}} glands that produce {{a variety of}} hormones including adrenaline and the steroids aldosterone and cortisol. They are found above the kidneys. Each gland has an outer cortex which produces steroid hormones and an inner medulla. The <b>adrenal</b> cortex itself {{is divided into three}} zones: zona glomerulosa, the zona fasciculata and the zona reticularis.|$|E
5|$|The <b>adrenal</b> glands are {{composed}} of two heterogenous types of tissue. In the center is the <b>adrenal</b> medulla, which produces adrenaline and noradrenaline and releases them into the bloodstream, {{as part of the}} sympathetic nervous system. Surrounding the medulla is the cortex, which produces a variety of steroid hormones. These tissues come from different embryological precursors and have distinct prenatal development paths. The cortex of the <b>adrenal</b> gland is derived from mesoderm, whereas the medulla is derived from the neural crest, which is of ectodermal origin.|$|E

5|$|The <b>adrenal</b> glands {{are located}} {{on both sides of}} the body in the retroperitoneum, above and {{slightly}} medial to the kidneys. In humans, the right <b>adrenal</b> gland is pyramidal in shape, whereas the left is semilunar or crescent shaped and somewhat larger. The <b>adrenal</b> glands measure approximately 3.0cm in width, 5.0cm in length, and up to 1.0cm in thickness. Their combined weight in an adult human ranges from 7 to 10grams. The glands are yellowish in colour.|$|E
5|$|The <b>adrenal</b> glands are {{surrounded}} by a fatty capsule and lie within the renal fascia, which also surrounds the kidneys. A weak wall of connective tissue called septum separates the glands from the kidneys. The <b>adrenal</b> glands are directly below the diaphragm, and {{are attached to the}} crura of the diaphragm by the renal fascia.|$|E
5|$|The <b>adrenal</b> medulla {{is derived}} from neural crest cells, which come from the {{ectoderm}} layer of the embryo. These cells migrate from their initial position and aggregate {{in the vicinity of}} the dorsal aorta, a primitive blood vessel, which activates the differentiation of these cells through the release of proteins known as BMPs. These cells then undergo a second migration from the dorsal aorta to form the <b>adrenal</b> medulla and other organs of the sympathetic nervous system. Cells of the <b>adrenal</b> medulla are called chromaffin cells because they contain granules that stain with chromium salts, a characteristic not present in all sympathetic organs. Glucocorticoids produced in the <b>adrenal</b> cortex were once thought to be responsible for the differentiation of chromaffin cells.
