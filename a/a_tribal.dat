5|$|Dunstan broke {{new ground}} in Australian {{politics}} with his policies on native title for Aborigines. The North West Aboriginal Reserve (NWAR) covered more than 7% of the state's land, and was inhabited by the Pitjantjatjara people. In 1977, when the NWAR {{was about to}} be transferred to the Aboriginal Lands Trust, <b>a</b> <b>tribal</b> delegation asked for the lands to be given to the traditional owners. Dunstan agreed to an investigation, and subsequently introduced the Pitjantjatjara Land Rights Bill. This bill proposed for <b>a</b> <b>tribal</b> body, the Anangu Pitjantjatjaraku, {{to take control of the}} NWAR and further lands after the claims were cleared by an independent tribunal. It also proposed to allow the body to decide mining proposals on the land and receive royalties. This aroused discontent among mining interests, but a bipartisan parliamentary committee endorsed the bill and it was tabled. However, Labor lost power before the bill was passed and although the new Liberal government said they would remove the mining restrictions, mass public rallies forced them to relent, and a bill similar to Dunstan's was passed. The legislation, the bedrock of which was laid by Dunstan, was the most reformist in Australia, and in the 1980s, more than 20% of the land was returned to its traditional owners.|$|E

5|$|Iraqi–British {{relations}} {{entered a}} short cooling-down period {{during and after}} the crisis. The Iraqis were previously encouraged by the British to detain Patriarch Shimun in order to defuse tensions. The British were also wary of Iraqi military leaders and recommended Sidqi, a senior ethnic Kurdish general who was stationed in Mosul, be transferred to another region due to his open animosity towards the Assyrians. Later, they had to intervene to dissuade Faysal from personally leading <b>a</b> <b>tribal</b> force to punish the Assyrians.|$|E
5|$|Joint <b>a</b> <b>Tribal</b> Council, of the Passamaquoddy Tribe v. Morton, 528 F.2d 370 (1st Cir. 1975), was a {{landmark}} decision regarding aboriginal {{title in the}} United States. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that the Nonintercourse Act applied to the Passamaquoddy and Penobscot, non-federally-recognized Indian tribes, and established a trust relationship between those tribes {{and the federal government}} that the state of Maine could not terminate.|$|E
5|$|On April 24, 2003, {{only two}} weeks after the fall of Baghdad, a dozen Turkish special forces were arrested in Da Quq (<b>a</b> <b>tribal</b> village 45 minutes north of Kirkuk). According to Time, a weekly world news magazine, they were wearing {{civilian}} clothes and intended to infiltrate Iraq, lagging behind a humanitarian convoy, in order to destabilize the region to a level where Turkey could reasonably send its own peacekeeping force. However, they were intercepted by American forces, who claimed they had received prior knowledge of the group.|$|E
50|$|The Hopi, an Indian Tribe, {{effectively}} {{have two}} parallel systems of local government.

The other is a traditional system of civil and spiritual leadership that traces back at least 1,000 years and is organized by villages and clans within each village.

5|$|The creek's use as <b>a</b> <b>tribal</b> {{boundary}} is disputed. As {{other southern}} California Native Americans have done, a tribe typically claimed {{both sides of}} a stream or river—and used drainage divides as boundaries instead. However, the presence of Aliso Canyon, a steep and difficult-to-traverse gorge, suggests the opposite. Kroeber (1907) was the first to support this theory, and many other archaeologists have followed as well. The Juaneño disagree, arguing that their boundary stretches north to the northern drainage divide of the Aliso Creek watershed, which supports the practice of claiming {{both sides of a}} stream.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{material}} from the Bronze Age and earlier has been recovered and excavations have shown that there was unsustained late-Neolithic and Bronze Age human activity in the vicinity. The earliest known permanent settlement dates from the Iron Age and began where a track running northwards from Bourne crossed the River Slea. Although only sparse pottery evidence has been found for the middle Iron Age period, 4,290 pellet mould fragments, likely used for minting and dated to 50BC–AD 50, have been uncovered south east of the modern town centre, south of a crossing of the River Slea and near Mareham Lane in Old Sleaford. The largest {{of its kind in}} Europe, the deposit has led archaeologists to consider that the site in Old Sleaford {{was probably one of the}} largest Corieltauvian settlements during this period and may have been <b>a</b> <b>tribal</b> centre.|$|E

Disturbed by the changes she sees in Al•Ith, Murti• exiles her to the frontier of Zone Two. Al•Ith, drawn by its allure, tries to enter Zone Two, but finds an unworldly and inhospitable place and is told by invisible people {{that it is not}} her time yet. At the frontier of Zone Five, Ben Ata reluctantly marries Vahshi, <b>a</b> <b>tribal</b> leader of a band of nomads who terrorise the inhabitants of her zone. But Ben Ata's marriage to Al•Ith has changed him, and he disbands most of his armies in Zone Four, sending the soldiers home to rebuild their towns and villages and uplift their communities. He also slowly wins over Vahshi's confidence and persuades her to stop plundering Zone Five.|$|E
5|$|Dunrobin Castle {{was built}} in the midst of <b>a</b> <b>tribal</b> society, with Norse and Gaelic in use at the time. Robert the Bruce planted the Gordons, who {{supported}} his claim to the crown, at Huntly in Aberdeenshire, and they were created Earls of Huntly in 1445. The Earldom passed to the Gordon family in the 16th century when the 8th Earl of Sutherland gave his daughter Elizabeth in marriage to Adam Gordon. After the 8th Earl died in 1508, Elizabeth's elder brother was declared heir to the title, but a brieve (writ) of idiocy brought against him and his younger brother by the Gordons meant that the possession of the estate went to Adam Gordon in 1512.|$|E
5|$|In the 1880s, Alfred Comyn Lyall, an {{administrator}} of the British Raj who also studied history, revisited Tod's classification and asserted that the Rajput society was in fact tribal, based on kinship rather than feudal vassalage. He had previously generally agreed with Tod, who acknowledged claims that blood-ties played some sort of role {{in the relationship between}} princes and vassals in many states. In shifting the emphasis from a feudal to <b>a</b> <b>tribal</b> basis, Lyall was able to deny the possibility that the Rajput kingdoms might gain sovereignty. If Rajput society was not feudal, then it was not on the same trajectory that European nations had followed, thereby forestalling any need to consider that they might evolve into sovereign states. There was thus no need for Britain to consider itself to be illegitimately governing them.|$|E

5|$|Mesopotamian {{influence}} {{continued to}} affect Mari's culture during the Amorite period, which {{is evident in}} the Babylonian scribal style used in the city. However, it was less influential than the former periods and a distinct Syrian style prevailed, which is noticeable in the seals of kings, which reflect a clear Syrian origin. The society was <b>a</b> <b>tribal</b> one, it consisted mostly of farmers and nomads (Haneans), and in contrast to Mesopotamia, the temple had a minor role in everyday life as the power was mostly invested in the palace. Women enjoyed a relative equality to men, queen Shibtu ruled in her husband's name while he was away, and had an extensive administrative role and authority over her husband's highest officials.|$|E
5|$|The band {{aimed for}} <b>a</b> <b>tribal</b> sound but {{encountered}} problems including minuscule timing errors; during this period, they refined their percussive sound by experimenting with erecting walls {{to isolate the}} drums and rearranging parts. In February 1996, during the mixing process, guitarist Donnie Steele {{decided to leave the}} band for religious reasons and as a result, Craig Jones joined the band to fill the spot; however, the band realized that they were incorporating too many samples on their recordings and could not reproduce these sounds live. To solve this problem, Jones moved to full-time sampler and Mick Thomson joined as a guitarist. Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. was released on October 31, 1996 with a release party at The Safari, a local club where the band played many of their earliest gigs.|$|E
5|$|The first {{settlement}} {{formed in}} the Iron Age where a prehistoric track crossed the River Slea. It was <b>a</b> <b>tribal</b> centre and home to a mint for the Corieltauvi in the 1st centuries BC and AD. Evidence of Roman and Anglo-Saxon settlement has been uncovered, and by the late Saxon period the town was an economic and jurisdictional centre with a court and market. In the medieval period, records differentiate between Old and New Sleaford, the latter emerging in the areas around the present day market place and St Denys' Church. Sleaford Castle was constructed in the 12th century for the Bishops of Lincoln, who owned the manor. Granted the right to hold a market in the mid-12th century, New Sleaford developed into a market town and became locally important in the wool trade, while Old Sleaford declined.|$|E
