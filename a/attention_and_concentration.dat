5|$|Mild {{impairment}} of <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> <b>concentration</b> may occur in any mental illness {{where people are}} anxious and distractible (including psychotic states), but more extensive cognitive abnormalities are likely to indicate a gross disturbance of brain functioning such as delirium, dementia or intoxication.

In Korsakoff's syndrome there is dramatic memory impairment with relative preservation of other cognitive functions.|$|E

The passenger had no connection with the airline, but was granted permission by the captain via acquaintance in the airline. Several of the other passengers were employees in Widerøe and shouldaccording to the airline's rulesinstead have been seated there. From Namsos to Brønnøysund there were available seats in the cabin, but the jump seat passenger continued {{to sit in the}} cockpit. The commission felt that the passenger's conversation with the captain drew his <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> <b>concentration</b> away from his duties at a critical point of the flight. This also disrupted communication between the two pilots, resulting in the mutual control being disrupted.|$|E

25|$|Patients with {{schizophrenia}} demonstrate spared {{performance on}} measures of visual and verbal <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> <b>concentration,</b> {{as well as on}} immediate digit span recall, suggesting that observed deficits cannot be attributed to deficits in attention or short-term memory.

500|$|<b>Attention</b> <b>and</b> <b>concentration</b> are {{assessed}} by the serial sevens test (or alternatively by spelling a five-letter word backwards), and by testing digit span. Memory is assessed in terms of immediate registration (repeating a set of words), short-term memory (recalling the set of words after an interval, or recalling a short paragraph), and long-term memory (recollection of well known historical or geographical facts). Visuospatial functioning can be {{assessed by the}} ability to copy a diagram, draw a clock face, or draw {{a map of the}} consulting room. Language is assessed through the ability to name objects, repeat phrases, and by observing the individual's spontaneous speech and response to instructions. Executive functioning can be screened for by asking the [...] "similarities" [...] questions ("what do x and y have in common?") and by means of a verbal fluency task (e.g. [...] "list as many words as you can starting with the letter F, in one minute"). The mini-mental state examination is a simple structured cognitive assessment which is in widespread use as a component of the MSE.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} an education-oriented {{portable}} brain-controlled robot system, {{consisting of a}} multi-parameter bioelectric signal acquisition device and a Lego NXT Mindstorms robot. The education-oriented portable brain-controlled robot system is only 45 cm 3 in volume and weighs 70 g. The signal acquisition section wirelessly acquires brain signals and the control section remotely navigates a Lego robot via brainwaves through a Bluetooth. Teenagers may use the low-cost brain-controlled robot to enjoy the pleasure of learning, to inspire their innovative ability and creativity, and to raise their mental concentration. Moreover, the proposed brain-controlled robot system {{might be used to}} improve the quality of adolescent education and autism recovery. The system modules include the brain signal acquisition, signal processing, and the robot control, which are developed in LabVIEW-based programming environment and easy to be expanded and upgraded. The comparative study of the education-oriented system and Cerebot equipped with the high precision Cerebus system widely used in laboratory research shows that the low-cost system delivers comparable accuracy for the robot control.

40|$|Background and aims: In many countries, the {{consumption}} of fruit, berries, and vegetables is about half the recommended. Berries contain bioactive compounds that may affect cognitive functions. School children are often hungry and thirsty during the lectures before lunch and this affects performance. Could a berry-smoothie decrease thirst and hunger, and thereby affect school performance? The aim was to investigate if a cross-over design {{can be used to}} study the effects of a smoothie on performance in a school setting. Methods: Methodological challenges included developing an appetizing berry-smoothie and choosing a suitable experimental design that could be adapted to school conditions. In the pilot study, 236 Swedish children aged 10 – 12 years participated in a cross-over design and were administered either a berry-smoothie or a fruit-based placebo after the midmorning break. Both beverages provided 5 % of the daily energy intake. Performance was assessed using the d 2 Test of Attention measuring <b>attention</b> span <b>and</b> <b>concentration.</b> Statistical analyses were performed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test in StatXact v 10. 3. Results: The consumption of both the smoothie and the placebo increased the <b>attention</b> span <b>and</b> <b>concentration</b> significantly. Conclusion: The children's performance in the d 2 Test of Attention was positively affected by beverage consumption. The effect was attributed to the supplementation of water and energy. In this design, the study did not permit any conclusive results regarding the effect of bioactive compounds on performance. In a coming study, a third group, receiving no beverage, should be included aiming to identify the cause of the effect...|$|R

40|$|Nurses {{working for}} telephone-based medical helplines must {{maintain}} attentional focus while quickly and accurately processing information given by callers to make safe and appropriate treatment decisions. In this study, both {{higher levels of}} general occupational stress and elevated stress levels on particular shifts were associated with more frequent failures of <b>attention,</b> memory, <b>and</b> <b>concentration</b> in telephone nurses. Exposure to a stressful shift was also associated with a measurable increase in objectively assessed information-processing errors.
