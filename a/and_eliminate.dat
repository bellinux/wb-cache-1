5|$|On 12 October, French troops {{backed by}} tanks, {{artillery}} and aerial support launched an operation to surround <b>and</b> <b>eliminate</b> al-Kharrat's rebels in the al-Zur forest. Al-Kharrat's men were forewarned of the French deployment by the peasants of al-Malihah. Positioned among the trees, the rebels used sniper fire against the French troops. The latter {{were unable to}} lure the rebels out and retreated.|$|E

5|$|Having {{detected}} the U.S. aircraft which deployed Snake flying over Soviet soil, the Soviet Union declares the United States {{responsible for the}} nuclear attack, tipping both nations {{to the edge of}} a nuclear war. In a secret conference between U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, a deal is hatched to prove the U.S.'s innocence and restore peace. The United States agrees to stop Volgin's renegade faction, destroy the stolen Shagohod <b>and</b> <b>eliminate</b> the American defector, The Boss.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{believed}} that Britain's refusal {{to end the}} war was based on the hope that the United States and the Soviet Union would enter the war against Germany sooner or later. He therefore decided to try to strengthen Germany's relations with the Soviets, or failing that, to attack <b>and</b> <b>eliminate</b> them as a factor. In November 1940, negotiations took place to determine if the Soviet Union would join the Tripartite Pact. The Soviets showed some interest, but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan that Germany considered unacceptable. On 18 December 1940, Hitler issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|In October and November 1944, Christie {{received}} intelligence regarding German {{plans to}} operate a wolfpack of U-boats in Australian waters.

Another U-boat disappeared en route while a fourth, U-862, evaded searchers to slip around the south coast of Australia and sink a Liberty ship south of Sydney in late December.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, {{it became}} {{increasingly}} apparent to U.S. planners that, {{in a military}} confrontation with Warsaw Pact forces, NATO aircraft would quickly suffer heavy losses. This came {{as a result of}} sophisticated Soviet defense networks, which used surveillance radars and radar-guided surface-to-air missiles (SAM) and anti-aircraft artillery to seek <b>and</b> <b>eliminate</b> enemy aircraft. Consequently, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) started a study on low-observability aircraft, seeking to design and produce an operational stealth aircraft. Five companies were initially invited, three of which bowed out early. The remaining two were later joined by Lockheed.|$|E
5|$|Late 1917 saw the High Seas Fleet {{beginning}} to conduct anti-convoy raids in the North Sea between Britain and Norway. In October and December 1917, two British convoys to Norway were intercepted and destroyed by German cruisers and destroyers, prompting Beatty, now the Commander in Chief of the Grand Fleet, to detach several battleships and battlecruisers to protect convoys. This presented to Admiral Scheer {{the opportunity for}} which he had been waiting the entire war: the chance to isolate <b>and</b> <b>eliminate</b> a portion of the Grand Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Leukocytes (white blood cells) {{act like}} independent, {{single-celled}} organisms {{and are the}} second arm of the innate immune system. The innate leukocytes include the phagocytes (macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells), innate lymphoid cells, mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, and natural killer cells. These cells identify <b>and</b> <b>eliminate</b> pathogens, either by attacking larger pathogens through contact or by engulfing and then killing microorganisms. Innate cells are also important mediators in lymphoid organ development and the activation of the adaptive immune system.|$|E

5|$|Some viruses {{replicate}} within archaea: {{these are}} double-stranded DNA viruses with unusual and sometimes unique shapes. These viruses {{have been studied}} in most detail in the thermophilic archaea, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Defences against these viruses involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences within archaean genomes {{that are related to}} the genes of the viruses. Most archaea have CRISPR–Cas systems as an adaptive defence against viruses. These enable archaea to retain sections of viral DNA, which are then used to target <b>and</b> <b>eliminate</b> subsequent infections by the virus using a process similar to RNA interference.|$|E
5|$|Spain {{learned of}} La Salle's mission in 1686. Concerned that the French colony could {{threaten}} Spain's {{control over the}} Viceroyalty of New Spain and the unsettled southeastern region of North America, the Crown funded multiple expeditions to locate <b>and</b> <b>eliminate</b> the settlement. The unsuccessful expeditions helped Spain {{to better understand the}} geography of the Gulf Coast region. When the Spanish finally discovered the remains of the French colony at the fort in 1689, they buried the cannons and burned the buildings. Years later, Spanish authorities built a presidio at the same location. When the presidio was abandoned, the site of the French settlement was lost to history.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese had {{excellent}} {{coordination between}} light bombers, helicopters and reinforced ground patrols. They utilised American tactics of quick airborne (helibourne) assaults supported by heavy aerial bombardments of FRELIMO camps by the Portuguese Air Force (Força Aérea Portuguesa or FAP) to surround <b>and</b> <b>eliminate</b> the guerrillas. These bombardments {{were accompanied by}} the use of heavy artillery. The Portuguese also used cavalry units to cover the flanks of patrols and where the terrain was too difficult to motor transport, and units of captured or deserted guerrillas to penetrate their former bases.|$|E

Oxygen seems to be distributed by the fluid of the coelom, which is circulated through the mantle and driven either by contractions of {{the lining of the}} coelom or by beating of its cilia.

5|$|The rules {{had been}} in use since the {{establishment}} of the club. Although a selection of rules from public schools were seen there, the 1858 rules show little evidence of their influence. Many of the original members were from the local Collegiate School, which favoured the kicking style of the game, rather than handling the ball. The kicking game was also prevalent in the local villages of Penistone and Thurlstone. The rules were the first to penalise foul play with a free kick, introduce the throw-in <b>and</b> <b>eliminate</b> the offside rule. They also had the unique feature of preventing a goal being scored directly from a free kick or throw-in.|$|E

5|$|The tariff levels {{had been}} a major {{political}} issue since before the Civil War, and they became the most dominant matter of the 1888 election. The high tariff rates had created a surplus {{of money in the}} Treasury, which led many Democrats (as well as the growing Populist movement) to call for lowering them. Most Republicans preferred to maintain the rates, spend the surplus on internal improvements <b>and</b> <b>eliminate</b> some internal taxes.|$|E
5|$|A {{ketogenic}} diet (high-fat, low-carbohydrate, adequate-protein) {{appears to}} decrease the number of seizures <b>and</b> <b>eliminate</b> seizures in some, however further research is necessary. It is a reasonable option in those who have epilepsy that is not improved with medications and for whom surgery is not an option. About 10% stay on the diet {{for a few years}} due to issues of effectiveness and tolerability. Side effects include stomach and intestinal problems in 30%, and there are long-term concerns about heart disease. Less radical diets are easier to tolerate and may be effective. It is unclear why this diet works. Exercise has been proposed as possibly useful for preventing seizures with some data to support this claim.|$|E
5|$|Ale {{have several}} adversaries, {{including}} dragons, zmajeviti (dragon-like) men, eagles, St. Elijah, and St. Sava. The principal {{enemy of the}} ala is the dragon; {{he is able to}} defeat her <b>and</b> <b>eliminate</b> her harmful effects. Dragons are thus seen as guardians of the fields and harvest, and as protectors against bad weather. When an ala threatens by bringing hail clouds, a dragon comes out to fight with her and drive her away. His main weapon is lightning; thunder represents a fight between ale and dragons (during which ale hide in tall trees). An instance of a more abundant crop at a particular point is explained in the Pčinja region {{as a result of a}} dragon having struck an ala with lightning just over that place, making her drop the looted grains she had been carrying in her huge ears. If an ala finds a dragon in a hollow tree, however, she can destroy him by burning the tree.|$|E
