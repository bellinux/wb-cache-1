25|$|She {{signed up}} for a brief six-week course in filmmaking at New York University (NYU), where she came into contact with budding young filmmaker Martin Scorsese, who was {{struggling}} to complete his film What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing in <b>a</b> <b>Place</b> <b>Like</b> <b>This?</b> A negative cutter had butchered his film, not leaving enough negative frames to allow for hot splicing. One of her film professors asked Schoonmaker to help Scorsese; a close working relationship with him unfolded over the next thirty-five years. Schoonmaker edited Scorsese's first feature film, Who's That Knocking at My Door (1967).|$|E
25|$|Scorsese {{attended}} New York University's Tisch School of the Arts (B.A., English, 1964; M.F.A., film, 1966) {{making the}} short films What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing in <b>a</b> <b>Place</b> <b>Like</b> <b>This?</b> (1963) and It's Not Just You, Murray! (1964). His most famous {{short of the}} period is the darkly comic The Big Shave (1967), which features Peter Bernuth. The film is an indictment of America's involvement in Vietnam, suggested by its alternative title Viet '67. Scorsese has mentioned on several occasions that he was greatly inspired in his early days at New York University by his Armenian American film professor Haig P. Manoogian.|$|E
500|$|The couple {{viewed the}} Loew's State {{engagement}} in 1937 as Skelton's big chance. They hired New York comedy writers to prepare {{material for the}} engagement, believing they needed more sophisticated jokes and skits than the routines Skelton normally performed. However, his New York audience did not laugh or applaud until Skelton abandoned the newly written material and began performing the [...] "Doughnut Dunkers" [...] and his older routines. The doughnut-dunking routine also helped Skelton rise to celebrity status. In 1937, while he was entertaining at the Capitol Theater in Washington, D.C., President Franklin D. Roosevelt invited Skelton to perform at a White House luncheon. During one of the official toasts, Skelton grabbed Roosevelt's glass, saying, [...] "Careful what you drink, Mr. President. [...] I got rolled in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> once." [...] His humor appealed to FDR and Skelton became the master of ceremonies for Roosevelt's official birthday celebration for many years afterward.|$|E

60|$|BLANCO. Just a moment, Sheriff. A good {{appearance}} is everything in <b>a</b> low-class <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> [He {{takes out a}} pocket comb and mirror, and retires towards the dais to arrange his hair].|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, anyway," [...] he decided, [...] "when I get old {{and quit}} the game, I'll settle down in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> {{something}} <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> {{and the city}} can go to hell." ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the years}} after Salk's discovery, many supporters, in {{particular}} the National Foundation, [...] "helped him build his dream of a research complex for the investigation of biological phenomena 'from cell to society'." [...] Called the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, it opened in 1963 in the San Diego neighborhood of La Jolla. Salk believed that the institution would help new and upcoming scientists along in their careers, as he said himself, [...] "I thought how nice {{it would be if}} <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> existed and I was invited to work there." [...] This was something that Salk was deprived of early in his life, but due to his achievements, was able to provide for future scientists.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush!" [...] exclaimed Cornelian nervously. [...] "You don't {{know who}} may overhear you in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> You'll get {{yourself}} into trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, fancy keeping <b>a</b> big <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> all {{overgrown}} {{and like}} a wilderness!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "If the Professor can't afford a few gardeners, why doesn't he take a comfortable flat down town." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my friend, {{what can}} you expect? When a {{thousand}} muskets are all turned upon <b>a</b> little <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> some one must suffer for it. Ah, my poor fellow, so you are done for too!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Fike merely {{waited and}} snapped: [...] "Sit down. You {{look as though}} you had enough sense to {{understand}} that we can't let people we don't know anything about enter <b>a</b> decent <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this....</b> Miss or Mrs., I said?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And, Major Merton," [...] I put in, [...] "what could you, or {{any other}} man, do with himself, in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> without companions, books, or {{occupation}} ?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I dare say, now, {{that they}} would think of asking, for <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> {{as much money as}} would buy a good {{wholesome}} ship--a regular A. No. 1." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's great!" [...] Teddy said, approvingly. [...] "A feller that's got <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> don't need to hire any rooms. I'd {{rather have}} it than a reg'lar house, any day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Only reflect for one moment,' said Nicholas; 'granting, for an instant, that it's {{likely he}} {{is alive and}} {{wandering}} about <b>a</b> lonely <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> so {{far removed from the}} public road, do you think that at this distance of time you could possibly know that man again?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Senhor Armstrong forgets {{he is not}} now in England," [...] said Pedro. [...] "We require neither {{invitation}} nor {{evening dress}} in <b>an</b> out-o'-the-way <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> You'll find {{all sorts of people}} there. Indeed, a few are likely to be of the class who prefer to dance with their coats off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh dear no, sir!" [...] exclaimed Mrs. Peckover, {{very much}} amazed. [...] "I {{should be ashamed}} of myself if I went making any {{objections}} to anything you wanted to know about little Mary. But it's strange to me to be in <b>a</b> beautiful <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> drinking wine with gentlefolks--and I'm almost afraid--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you find}} the {{accommodation}} of the car insufficient," [...] said Sir Richmond {{in a tone of}} extreme reasonableness, and I admit it is, we can easily hire a larger car in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thank you}} for this advice, Quartermaster, which is the more {{acceptable}} as it costs nothing; but I do not think it belongs to my gifts to yield <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> while food and water last." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was always}} a chapel man; but--I don't know how it is--there's {{something}} in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> that makes church seem more--more suitable; my wife always had a leaning that way. I never conceal my actions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see, Mr. Henchard," [...] {{said the}} lawyer, another goodnatured friend, [...] "where {{you made the}} mistake was in going so far afield. You should have taken a leaf out of his book, and have had your sports in <b>a</b> {{sheltered}} <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> But you didn't think of it, you see; and he did, and that's where he's beat you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish she}} had <b>a</b> nice <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> {{to be sick}} in. It must be very poky in those little rooms," [...] said Jack, as his eye roved round the large chamber where he lay so cosey, warm, and pleasant, with the gay chintz {{curtains}} draping doors and windows, the rosy carpet, comfortable chairs, and a fire glowing in the grate.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will only}} remind you, then, that he shows it in strange fashion," [...] Lessingham continued. [...] "He sets your wishes at defiance. He {{who should be}} an example in <b>a</b> small <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> is only <b>an</b> object of {{contempt}} in the neighbourhood. Even I, who have only lived here for so short a time, have caught the burden of what people say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no. You're {{very far}} from the mark. Kenwardine {{certainly}} likes a bet and sometimes runs a bank, but all he wins wouldn't do much to keep up <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> However, you can see for yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, look here, it's rot. You {{must keep}} your {{end up in}} <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> or {{everybody}} in the house'll be ragging you. Chaps will, naturally, play the goat if you let them. Has this ever happened before?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} wonder, why remain a member under those conditions?" [...] {{continued}} Herlton. [...] "Well, {{as far as}} I am concerned, <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> is a necessity for me. In fact, it's my profession, my source of income." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{the wife}} {{of one of the}} workmen Dick had on the carpet. Such things do arise on <b>a</b> large <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> I wouldn't know the woman if I saw her, and I didn't {{recognize}} her name. She was whimpering out her trouble when Dick stopped her. 'Never mind all that,' he said. 'What I want to know is, did you give Smith any encouragement?' ...|$|R
60|$|Colonel Keith {{went back}} to be seized by Conrade and Francis, and walked off to the pony inspection, the two boys, {{on either side of}} him, {{communicating}} to him the great grievance of living in <b>a</b> poky <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> where nobody had ever been in the army, nor had a bit of sense, and Aunt Rachel was always bothering, and trying to make mamma think that Con told stories.|$|R
6000|$|... "You do see {{yourself}} a bit ghostish——" [...] said he, [...] "on {{a background of}} your ancestors. I always think when you stop in <b>an</b> old <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> you sort of keep company with your ancestors too much; I sometimes feel like {{a bit of the}} old building walking about; the old feelings of the old folks stick to you like the lichens on the walls; you sort of get hoary." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Melbury {{explained}} the circumstances as coherently as he could. [...] "I told you so," [...] he said. [...] "A maid like her couldn't stay hid long, even in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> But where is Grace? Let's have her down. Here--Gra-a-ace!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Before I {{go to my}} work," [...] {{said the}} latter, [...] "it is my habit {{to sit here and}} enjoy the scenery and a few puffs. I suppose when you come to <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> you throw work to the winds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I like it {{well enough}} {{if there is}} plenty of room, and {{everyone}} is lively. In <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> I'm sure to upset something, tread on people's toes, or do something dreadful, so I keep out of mischief and let Meg sail about. Don't you dance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They do gossip in <b>a</b> small <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> most amazing," [...] {{the girl}} said slowly. [...] "When {{you and the other}} lady came down from London to stay up yonder, they did say that you were a great heiress, and that Mr. De la Borne was {{counting}} on marrying you, and buying back all the lands that have slipped away from the De la Bornes back to Burnham Market and Wells township." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Edson!" [...] I says [...] "My dear! Take care. How {{ever did}} you lose your way and stumble on <b>a</b> {{dangerous}} <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this?</b> Why you must have come here by the most perplexing streets in all London. No wonder you are lost, I'm sure. And this place too! Why I thought nobody ever got here, except me to order my coals and the Major in the parlours to smoke his cigar!"--for I saw that blessed man close by, pretending to it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense, Captain," [...] said Mabberly; [...] "surely {{you don't}} think that taking a holiday in <b>a</b> {{pleasant}} <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> is wasting time. Besides, I don't consider you free from your engagement to me. You were hired for the trip, {{and that includes}} land as well as water, so I won't give you your discharge till {{you have had a}} long rest, and recruited yourselves after the shock to your nervous systems occasioned by the wreck and the swim to shore!" ...|$|R
