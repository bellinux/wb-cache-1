5|$|A timer {{ensured that}} the bomb would not explode until at least fifteen seconds after release, one-quarter of the {{predicted}} fall time, to ensure safety of the aircraft. The timer was activated when the electrical pull-out plugs connecting it to the airplane pulled loose as the bomb fell, switching it to internal (24V battery) power and starting the timer.

25|$|The {{court found}} no {{evidence}} of error by the Swedish crew, although it noted that the erroneous QFF may have caused the altimeter to be wrong by one millibar. Although there was evidence of a failure to adhere to proper radio communications procedure, it probably was not a factor in the accident. The report stated there was {{reason to believe that the}} York's <b>altimeters</b> were set a lot higher than the Regional QFF. This may have been caused by using the wrong QFF sent earlier by the controller or that the <b>altimeters</b> were still set to the standard mean sea level barometric pressure.|$|E

25|$|Later {{the same}} year (1996), Aeroperú Flight 603, also {{operated}} with a Boeing 757, suffered a similar but far more difficult situation (static ports blocked by tape, rendering all airspeed indicators and pressure <b>altimeters</b> unusable) and crashed in the ocean off Peru.|$|E
25|$|The US Navy began {{acquiring}} UH-1B helicopters {{from the}} Army and these aircraft were modified into gunships with special gun mounts and radar <b>altimeters</b> and {{were known as}} Seawolves in service with Navy Helicopter Attack (Light) (HA(L)-3). UH-1C helicopters were also acquired in the 1970s. The Seawolves worked as a team with Navy river patrol operations.|$|E
25|$|The {{flight to}} Seattle had gone without incident. The landing took place with an {{instrument}} landing system (ILS) approach, with the autopilot coupler being used down to 100 to 60 meters (300–200ft) before a manual completion. The aircraft had three maintenance issues at Seattle, consisting of a non-functioning fast–slow airspeed function, low oil on the number one engine and a non-functioning lavatory light. The final crew arrived at Seattle–Tacoma {{an hour before the}} flight and was given necessary documentation. Flight time was estimated at two hours, 16 minutes. All preflight checks were concluded without discrepancies. The aircraft was de-iced and the <b>altimeters</b> set and cross-checked. The flight departed Seattle at 15:46 Pacific Standard Time (PST), one hour and eleven minutes after schedule. The first officer was designated as pilot flying. The <b>altimeters</b> were recalibrated and the autopilot was used for the climb and cruise.|$|E
50|$|The radar <b>altimeter</b> can be {{replaced}} by a newly developed laser <b>altimeter,</b> which is much less likely to be detected via ESM. The laser <b>altimeter</b> can be retrofited to all models of this anti-ship missile family.|$|R
40|$|A pulse-limited split-gate-tracking radar <b>altimeter</b> {{was flown}} on Skylab {{and will be}} used aboard GEOS-C. If such an <b>altimeter</b> were to employ a {{hypothetical}} isotropic antenna, the <b>altimeter</b> output would be independent of spacecraft orientation. To reduce power requirements the gain of the <b>altimeter</b> antenna proposed is increased {{to the point where}} its beamwidth is only a few degrees. The gain of the antenna consequently varies somewhat over the pulse-limited illuminated region of the ocean below the <b>altimeter,</b> and the <b>altimeter</b> output varies with antenna orientation. The error introduced into the <b>altimeter</b> data is modeled empirically, but close agreements with the expected errors was not realized. The attitude error effects expected with the GEOS-C <b>altimeter</b> are modelled using a form suggested by an analytical derivation. The treatment is restricted to the case of a relatively smooth sea, where the height of the ocean waves are small relative to the spatial length (pulse duration times speed of light) of the transmitted pulse...|$|R

25|$|Barometers and {{pressure}} <b>altimeters</b> (the most basic and {{common type of}} altimeter) are essentially the same instrument, but used for different purposes. An altimeter {{is intended to be}} transported from place to place matching the atmospheric pressure to the corresponding altitude, while a barometer is kept stationary and measures subtle pressure changes caused by weather. The main exception to this is ships at sea, which can use a barometer because their elevation does not change.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{arrival in}} the Northolt area both {{aircraft}} were placed in a stacking pattern, which {{in addition to the}} two involved aircraft included two other aircraft at higher altitudes. Each stack had an intermediate distance of 500feet. The stacking was regulated by the air traffic control of Metropolitan Zone. Any aircraft entering the stack had to follow orders from air traffic control, which indicated their altitudes and route, and issued gates allowing the aircraft to enter and leave. Air traffic control issued atmospheric pressure measurements (QFE), allowing the aircraft to synchronise their <b>altimeters.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{inquiry report}} was {{published}} on 21 January 1949. One conclusion {{found that the}} height separation in force in the Northolt area of 500feet provided an inadequate margin of safety and recommended that it be increased to 1,000feet for the Metropolitan Control Zone. The report also discusses the standard setting for <b>altimeters</b> (known as the regional QFF) that had been introduced in May 1948 for aircraft above 1,500feet within control zones, and that any error in setting the barometric pressure of one millibar gave an error of 28feet.|$|E

25|$|In the US {{and in most}} of {{the western}} world, skydivers are {{required}} to carry two parachutes. The reserve parachute must be periodically inspected and re-packed (whether used or not) by a certified parachute rigger (in the US, an FAA certificated parachute rigger). Many skydivers use an automatic activation device (AAD) that opens the reserve parachute at a pre-determined altitude if it detects that the skydiver is still in free fall. Depending on the country, AADs are often mandatory for new jumpers, and/or required for all jumpers regardless of their experience level. Most skydivers wear a visual altimeter, and an increasing number also use audible <b>altimeters</b> fitted to their helmets.|$|E
25|$|A {{radar system}} has a {{transmitter}} that emits radio waves called radar signals in predetermined directions. When these {{come into contact}} with an object they are usually reflected or scattered in many directions. But some of them absorb and penetrate into the target to some degree. Radar signals are reflected especially well by materials of considerable electrical conductivity—especially by most metals, by seawater and by wet ground. Some of these make the use of radar <b>altimeters</b> possible. The radar signals that are reflected back towards the transmitter are the desirable ones that make radar work. If the object is moving either toward or away from the transmitter, there is a slight equivalent change in the frequency of the radio waves, caused by the Doppler effect.|$|E
25|$|An {{investigation}} {{commission was}} appointed, {{consisted of three}} regular members, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Eirik Sandberg, Police Inspector Johan Fr. Kielland and Pilot Eivind Veierstad, {{in addition to their}} secretary, Hans Georg Andersen. Arne Viik, an expert in aviation navigation, was appointed for the individual investigation. The commission's regular members were contacted at 17:00 {{on the day of the}} accident and they started their work immediately. The wreck was taken to Fornebu for investigation, the flight recorder was sent to Copenhagen and the <b>altimeters</b> were sent to the United States. They interviewed several hundred people, flew the flight with a similar aircraft in the same light and weather conditions and by February 1973 had collected more than two and a half meters of notes and documents. Because of the navigational errors, the commission test-flew the route several times. When the beacon was transmitting false signals and they followed them without correlating by other means, the commission's test flights gave a course that would have resulted in a crash, had they not aborted.|$|E
40|$|A global {{comparison}} of <b>altimeter</b> and ERA- 40 mean wave period data is performed {{for the first}} time. <b>Altimeter</b> and ERA- 40 mean wave period are shown to compare well in non-swell-dominated conditions.

A new expression is given to relate <b>altimeter</b> data to wave period in wind-dominated conditions. Provided this correction is applied, <b>altimeter</b> data are adequate for the most needed validation of global model mean wave period data in non-swell-dominated conditions.

500|$|The {{pressure}} altimeter, {{also known}} as the barometric altimeter, is used to determine changes in air pressure that occur as the aircraft's altitude changes. [...] Pressure <b>altimeters</b> must be calibrated prior to flight to register the pressure as an altitude above sea level. [...] The instrument case of the altimeter is airtight and has a vent to the static port. [...] Inside the instrument, there is a sealed aneroid barometer.

500|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{barometric}} stage was to delay activating the radar altimeter firing command circuit until near detonation altitude. A thin metallic membrane enclosing a vacuum chamber (a similar design is still used today in old-fashioned wall barometers) gradually deformed as ambient air pressure increased during descent. The barometric fuze was not considered accurate enough to detonate the bomb at the precise ignition height, because air pressure varies with local conditions. When the bomb reached the design height for this stage (reportedly [...] ), the membrane closed a circuit, activating the radar <b>altimeters.</b> The barometric stage was added because of a worry that external radar signals might detonate the bomb too early.|$|E
500|$|While {{they waited}} for the guns to be {{fabricated}} by the Naval Gun Factory, various propellants were tested. Hirschfelder sent John L. Magee to the Bureau of Mines' Experimental Mine at Bruceton, Pennsylvania to test the propellant and ignition system. Test firing was conducted at the Anchor Ranch with a /50 caliber gun. This allowed the fine-tuning of the testing instrumentation. The first two tubes arrived at Los Alamos on 10 March 1944, and test firing began at the Anchor Ranch under the direction of Thomas H. Olmstead, who had experience in such work at the Naval Proving Ground in Dahlgren, Virginia. The primers were tested and found to work at pressures up to [...] Brode's group investigated the fusing systems, testing radar <b>altimeters,</b> proximity fuses and barometric altimeter fuses.|$|E
500|$|Inherent errors {{may fall}} into several categories, each {{affecting}} different instruments. [...] Density errors affect instruments metering airspeed and altitude. [...] This type of error {{is caused by}} variations of pressure and temperature in the atmosphere. [...] A compressibility error can arise because the impact pressure will cause the air to compress in the pitot tube. At standard sea level pressure altitude the calibration equation (see calibrated airspeed) correctly accounts for the compression {{so there is no}} compressibility error at sea level. At higher altitudes the compression is not correctly accounted for and will cause the instrument to read greater than equivalent airspeed. A correction may be obtained from a chart. Compressibility error becomes significant at altitudes above [...] and at airspeeds greater than [...] Hysteresis is an error that is caused by mechanical properties of the aneroid capsules located within the instruments. [...] These capsules, used to determine pressure differences, have physical properties that resist change by retaining a given shape, even though the external forces may have changed. Reversal errors are caused by a false static pressure reading. [...] This false reading may be caused by abnormally large changes in an aircraft's pitch. [...] A large change in pitch will cause a momentary showing of movement in the opposite direction. [...] Reversal errors primarily affect <b>altimeters</b> and vertical speed indicators.|$|E
