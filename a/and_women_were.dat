A $1 million USD prize {{was given to the}} winning team. American Grit premiered on Fox on April 14, 2016. Cena has been retweeting motivational tweets from his followers on Twitter who used the hashtag #ShowYourGrit, {{in a way that the}} fan did something motivational to his/her friends in a real-life scenario. The finale of Season 1 aired on June 9, 2016.|$|E
5|$|For a {{relatively}} small fee, entrance could be gained by {{any member of the}} general public to the Bath complex. While the area was obviously primarily used for public bathing, one could exercise and enjoy a variety of recreational activities. Attendants were paid to oversee these activities, and the happenings of the complex, enforcing opening and closing times, and the rules of conduct. Men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> not allowed to bathe together; they would either be in separate baths, or bathe at different times of the day.|$|E
5|$|Historically, among certain Asian and Native American {{cultures}} {{the family}} structure {{consisted of a}} grandmother and her children, especially daughters, who raised their own children together and shared child care responsibilities. Uncles, brothers, and other male relatives sometimes helped out. Romantic relationships between men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> formed and dissolved with little impact on the children who remained in the mother's extended family.|$|E
50|$|Gender {{inequality}} {{can further}} be understood through {{the mechanisms of}} sexism. Discrimination takes place in this manner as men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> subject to prejudicial treatment {{on the basis of}} gender alone. Sexism occurs when men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> framed within two dimensions of social cognition.|$|R

5|$|In 1691, {{the colonies}} of Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth were united (along with present-day Maine, which had {{previously}} been divided between Massachusetts and New York) into the Province of Massachusetts Bay. Shortly after {{the arrival of the}} new province's first governor, William Phips, the Salem witch trials took place, where a number of men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> hanged for alleged witchcraft.|$|E
5|$|At {{a border}} {{post on the}} way to Paraguay, Cacambo and Candide speak to the commandant, who turns out to be Cunégonde's unnamed brother. He {{explains}} that after his family was slaughtered, the Jesuits' preparation for his burial revived him, and he has since joined the order. When Candide proclaims he intends to marry Cunégonde, her brother attacks him, and Candide runs him through with his rapier. After lamenting all the people (mainly priests) he has killed, he and Cacambo flee. In their flight, Candide and Cacambo come across two naked women being chased and bitten by a pair of monkeys. Candide, seeking to protect the women, shoots and kills the monkeys, but is informed by Cacambo that the monkeys <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> probably lovers.|$|E
5|$|During the war the Australian Government greatly {{expanded}} its powers {{in order to}} better direct the war effort, and Australia's industrial and human resources were focused on supporting the Allied armed forces. The expansion of the government's powers began on 9 September 1939 when the National Security Act became law. This act enabled the government to introduce industrial conscription, and both men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> ordered into essential industries. Rationing was first introduced in 1940 and was {{greatly expanded}} during 1942. The Government also strongly encouraged austerity and war bonds as a means of reducing demand for scarce resources.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} both men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> obligated {{to carry out}} all commandments {{concerning}} their fathers. Rav Judah interpreted the Mishnah to mean that both men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> bound to perform all precepts concerning a father that are incumbent upon a son to perform for his father.|$|R

50|$|A {{mixture of}} two {{unimodal}} distributions with differing means {{is not necessarily}} bimodal. The combined distribution of heights of men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>is</b> sometimes used {{as an example of}} a bimodal distribution, but in fact the difference in mean heights of men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>is</b> too small relative to their standard deviations to produce bimodality.|$|R
5|$|Following this, the 31st Army drove {{towards the}} Baltic coast. The 331st {{captured}} the rail junction of Landsberg from the march, and Berestov ordered the division northward, unaware {{that it was}} coming {{into the path of}} a powerful German counterstrike to hold open a land link to the rest of Germany. Under pressure, the 331st fell back to the outskirts of Landsberg, and savage fighting ensued. Meanwhile, the German columns led by Waffen SS troops bypassed the town to the south and north, leaving the fighting elements of the division encircled for two days until they were relieved from outside. Meanwhile, the southern German column had rampaged through the mostly-defenseless rear elements of the division, destroying the medical-sanitation battalion, the motor pool, and other units; in total more than 300 men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> killed and more wounded.|$|E
5|$|In early 1612, {{the year}} of the trials, every justice of the peace (JP) in Lancashire was ordered to compile a list of recusants in their area, i.e. those who refused to attend the English Church and to take communion, a {{criminal}} offence at that time. Roger Nowell of Read Hall, on the edge of Pendle Forest, was the JP for Pendle. It was against this background of seeking out religious nonconformists that, in March 1612, Nowell investigated a complaint made to him by the family of John Law, a pedlar, who claimed to have been injured by witchcraft. Many of those who subsequently became implicated as the investigation progressed did indeed consider themselves to be witches, in the sense of being village healers who practised magic, probably in return for payment, but such men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> common in 16th-century rural England, an accepted part of village life.|$|E
5|$|Marriages {{were highly}} ritualized, {{particularly}} for the wealthy, and included many important steps. The giving of betrothal gifts, known as bridewealth and dowry, were especially important. A lack of either was considered dishonorable and the woman would have been seen not as a wife, but as a concubine. Arranged marriages were normal, with the father's input on his offspring's spouse being considered {{more important than the}} mother's. Monogamous marriages were also normal, although nobles and high officials were wealthy enough to afford and support concubines as additional lovers. Under certain conditions dictated by custom, not law, both men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> able to divorce their spouses and remarry. However, a woman who had been widowed continued to belong to her husband's family after his death. In order to remarry, the widow would have to be returned to her family in exchange for a ransom fee. Her children {{would not be allowed to}} go with her.|$|E

5|$|Nazi Germany had {{a strong}} anti-tobacco {{movement}} as pioneering research by Franz H. Müller in 1939 demonstrated a causal link between tobacco smoking and lung cancer. The Reich Health Office took measures to try to limit smoking, including producing lectures and pamphlets. Smoking was banned in many workplaces, on trains and among on-duty members of the military. Government agencies also worked to control other carcinogenic substances such as asbestos and pesticides. As {{part of a general}} public health campaign, water supplies were cleaned up, lead and mercury were removed from consumer products <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> urged to undergo regular screenings for breast cancer.|$|E
5|$|Such {{treatment}} of the Christians for refusals by the girls is also confirmed in the accounts of British officer James Scurry, who was held captive along with the Mangalorean Catholics. In his book The Captivity, Sufferings, and Escape of James Scurry, who was Detained a Prisoner During Ten Years, in the Dominions of Hyder Ali and Tippoo Saib (1824), Scurry also reports that Tipu relented on his demand for captive girls, after one captive fell from her beast and expired on the spot through loss of blood. About 200 young women, the prettiest and fairest, were selected for Tipu's seraglio. The rest {{of the women were}} distributed as wives to Muslim officers and favourites living there. The future Christian progeny of these young girls <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> lost, and their descendants are fully Islamic as of today.|$|E
5|$|The {{demobilisation}} of the Australian military after World War II involved discharging almost 600,000 men {{and women}} from the military, supporting their transition to civilian life and reducing the three armed services to peacetime strengths. Planning for the demobilisation process began in 1942 and thousands of servicemen <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> discharged {{in the last years of}} the war in response to shortages of labour in the domestic war economy. The general demobilisation of the military began in October 1945 and was completed in February 1947. The demobilisation process was largely successful, though some military personnel stationed in the South West Pacific complained that their repatriation to Australia was too slow.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} festival to Athena in Athens was the Lesser Panathenaea, held annually, which {{was open to}} both sexes. Men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> apparently not segregated during the procession leading the animals sacrificed to the altar, the festival's most religiously-significant part. Metics, both men and women, also had role in the Panathenaic procession, though it was subordinate {{to the role of}} the Athenians. In the procession, young noble girls (kanephoroi) carried sacred baskets. The girls were required to be virgins; to prevent a candidate from being selected was, according to Pomeroy, to question her good name. The sister of Harmodius was reportedly rejected as a kanephoros by the sons of Peisistratos, precipitating his assassination of Hipparchus.|$|E
5|$|The riot {{ended on}} the night of August 2. Cleanup efforts started that day; the New York City Department of Sanitation worked to clean the area for three days and the New York City Departments of Buildings and Housing boarded windows. The city {{assigned}} a police escort for all department workers. The Red Cross gave Harlemites lemonade and crullers, and the mayor organized various hospitals to handle an influx of injured patients. By August 4, traffic had resumed through the borough, and taverns reopened the next day. La Guardia had food delivered to the residents of Harlem, and on August 6, food supplies returned to normal levels. Overall, six people died and nearly 700 were injured. Six hundred men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> arrested in connection with the riot.|$|E
5|$|Though women Friends {{had since}} the 1660s {{publicly}} preached, written and led, and traditional Quaker tenets held that men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> equals, Quaker women met {{separately from the}} men to consider and decide a congregation's business. By the 1840s, some Hicksite Quakers determined to bring women and men together in their business meetings {{as an expression of}} their spiritual equality. In June 1848, approximately 200Hicksites, including the Hunts and the M'Clintocks, formed an even more radical Quaker group, known as the Yearly Meeting of Congregational Friends, or Progressive Friends. The Progressive Friends intended to further elevate the influence of women in affairs of the faith. They introduced joint business meetings of men and women, giving women an equal voice.|$|E

5|$|When Korea {{was split}} into two {{separate}} countries, North and South, along the 38th parallel tensions {{between the two countries}} were worsened when other countries began to get involved on both sides. The communist country of North Korea was supported by Russia, China and others, while the democratic South was supported by the United Nations and the United States. In 1950 the United States got involved and {{over the next three years}} more than 1.5 million US service members would serve in Korea. During the three years of the war 133 Medals of Honor were presented and although more than 150,000 Jewish American men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> serving in Korea at that time, not one received the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|Wilkinson {{made her}} first {{priority}} {{the raising of}} the school leaving age. This required the recruitment and training of thousands of extra teachers, and creating classroom space for almost 400,000 extra children. Under the Emergency Training Scheme (ETS), ex-servicemen <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> given grants to train as teachers on an accelerated one-year programme; more than 37,000 had been or were being trained {{by the end of}} 1946. The rapid expansion of school premises was achieved by the erection of temporary huts—some of which became long-term features of schools. Wilkinson was determined that the higher leaving age be implemented by 1 April 1947—the date set by the 1944 Act—and in the face of parliamentary scepticism insisted that her plans were on track. Final cabinet approval to honour the April date was given on 16 January 1947.|$|E

Around 8,000 people worked on the project, and Frank A. Banks served as the chief construction engineer. Bert A. Hall was the chief inspector who would accept the dam from the contractors. Orin G.
