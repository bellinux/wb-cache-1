40|$|Lake-dwellings in the {{northern}} Alpine region are renowned for their extraordinary organic preservation. In addition to organic remains, thousands of ceramic sherds are also recovered. This paper addresses ceramic sherds from the Late Bronze Age site Zürich-Alpenquai, and assesses over 2000 sherds for indications of erosion and abrasion in addition to quantifying sherd size and plotting the spatial distribution of these factors. Recording such wear patterns can provide indications of deposition practices in addition to environmental conditions pre- and post-deposition. In this manner the study of ceramic remains from wetland sites for abrasion can complement environmental studies <b>addressing</b> <b>conditions</b> {{at the time of}} artefact deposition, and contribute to discussions of influences for lake-settlement abandonment...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of the Cleveland Metropolitan School District’s (CMSD) districtwide efforts to improve school safety, order, and {{conditions}} for learning. These approaches include implementing (1) a social and emotional learning program for elementary students (PATHS); (2) a planning model for students exhibiting academic or nonacademic needs (student support teams); and (3) a learner-centered approach to discipline (planning centers). We found that improved conditions for learning as well as student support interventions can foster safer, more productive schools. Suspension and expulsion rates decreased, but racial/ethnic disparities remained. Implementation quality also mediated outcomes. Transforming conditions contributing to exclusionary discipline often requires a sustained effort that should begin with an understanding that a culture of change, unlike “quick fixes” (e. g., metal detectors), requires time to engage stakeholders, cultivate their buy-in, and develop and implement an effective plan. We conclude with six recommendations <b>addressing</b> <b>conditions</b> for learning, student supports, and disciplinary disparities...|$|E
30|$|As a byproduct, sent {{interlocks}} {{result in}} socio-cognitive {{benefits for the}} tie-creating executives. First, boundary-spanning connections enable executives to make new experiences and, thus, to expand existing and gain new competencies. Serving as outside directors, {{they are exposed to}} a larger range of alternative viewpoints and strategic options, which is beneficial for their ability to identify and develop high-quality solutions and make strategic choices (e.g., Geletkanycz and Hambrick 1997; McDonald et al. 2008). Second, <b>addressing</b> <b>conditions</b> of bounded rationality and environmental uncertainty as ubiquitous constraints to managerial decision making (Cyert and March 1963), sent interlocks provide the opportunity for executives to make social comparisons (Festinger 1954). As outside directors on other companies’ boards, executives are able to observe what comparable firms do and how they execute their decisions, which might reduce their decision-making uncertainty (Geletkanycz and Hambrick 1997). In the long run, these socio-cognitive benefits will not only be of value for the executives but will translate into knowledge-based benefits for the firm.|$|E
40|$|Objective Recent {{increases}} in adolescent pregnancies have sparked a renewed impetus to identify risk factors, such as {{childhood sexual abuse}} (CSA), associated with adolescent pregnancy. Given mixed evidence regarding {{the strength of the}} relationship between CSA and adolescent pregnancy (Blinn-Pike, Berger, Dixon, Kuschel, & Kaplan, 2002), our objective was to provide an estimate of the effect size of this relationship using updated literature and meta-analytic techniques.  Methods Meta-analyses of 21 studies were conducted using a random effects model of binary outcomes to determine aggregate effect-size estimates controlling for study heterogeneity.  Results CSA significantly increased the odds of experiencing an adolescent pregnancy by 2. 21 -fold (95 % CI: 1. 94 – 2. 51). A supplemental analysis suggested that 4. 5 out of 10 pregnant adolescents may have a prior history of CSA.  Conclusions CSA places females at increased risk for subsequent adolescent pregnancy. <b>Addressing</b> <b>conditions</b> associated with CSA might impact the overall adolescent pregnancy rate...|$|E

40|$|Because of the {{significant}} loss of oak (Quercus spp.) habitat and the subsequent increased value placed on oak woodlands for wildlife habitat, the preservation and restoration of native oak woodlands has become a priority for land managers and conservationists in the Western United States. In 1998, reconnaissance surveys were conducted on 13 oak woodland sites managed by the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM’s) Eugene District in Lane County, Oregon. The sites were classified as either meadow-type communities or woodland-type communities; oak patches within the sites were delineated; and the topographic features, vegetation structure, and composition of the sites were characterized. Current conditions were then compared with conditions documented in historical records. In addition, the wildlife species most likely occurring on the sites were identified. Literature from oak woodland studies was then reviewed to determine whether certain management and restoration methods, such as eliminating conifer encroachment and thinning closed-canopy stands, would be effective in <b>addressing</b> <b>conditions</b> observed at the BLM sites...|$|E

This work draws on the historical influences of folkloric and fantasy inspired imagery and utilises sources such as Polish ritual costumes and Japanese ‘cosplay’, as well as narrative structures of Polish folklore stories (oral tellings and printed fairy tales), manga (Japanese cartoons) and anime (Japanese animation). Through surface compositions, digital printing, cloth and textile forms the work recalls vanishing historical and personal memories. In a broader context, to invoke this process of recovery through the installation practice, I deploy two-dimensional and three-dimensional practices (textiles, painting, sculpture and digital media). Arrangements of objects, text, digital prints and traditional making-practices (crochet) with depictions of shape-shifting identities explore ways of constructing spaces that seek to stabilise the irreconcilable through the recovery and salvaging of historical, collective, personal and sensory experiences and memory and which, {{at the same time}} resist the local structures of feeling of my birth place in Poland.

40|$|The {{rates of}} type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus, obesity, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) continue to increase at epidemic proportions. It has become clear that these disease states are not independent but are frequently interrelated. By <b>addressing</b> <b>conditions</b> such as obesity, insulin resistance, stress hyperglycemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and diabetes mellitus, with its micro- and macrovascular complications, a specific treatment strategy can be developed. These conditions can be addressed by early identification of patients {{at high risk for}} {{type 2 diabetes}}, prompt and aggressive treatment of their hyperglycemia, recognition of the pleiotropic and synergistic benefits of certain antidiabetes agents on CVD, and thus, avoiding potential complications including hypoglycemia and weight gain. Incretin-based therapies, which include glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors, have the potential to alter the course of type 2 diabetes and associated CVD complications. Advantages of these therapies include glucose-dependent enhancement of insulin secretion, infrequent instances of hypoglycemia, weight loss with GLP- 1 receptor agonists, weight maintenance with DPP-IV inhibitors, decreased blood pressure, improvements in dyslipidemia, and potential beneficial effects on CV function...|$|E
