5|$|For a {{landscape}} artist, it seems Ruisdael travelled relatively little: to Blaricum, Egmond aan Zee, and Rhenen in the 1640s, with Nicolaes Berchem to Bentheim and Steinfurt just <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>in</b> Germany in 1650, and possibly with Hobbema across the German border again in 1661, via the Veluwe, Deventer and Ootmarsum.

5|$|Mass escapes were rare. One of the {{few that}} succeeded took place on 2October 1961, when 53people from the border village of Böseckendorf– {{a quarter of the}} village's population– escaped en masse, {{followed}} by another 13inhabitants in February 1963. An unusual mass escape occurred in September 1964 when 14East Germans, including 11 children, were smuggled <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>in</b> a refrigerated truck. They were able to escape detection by being concealed under the carcasses of slaughtered pigs being transported to the West.|$|E
5|$|At {{positions}} west of Hill 881 South {{and north}} of Co Roc Ridge, <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>in</b> Laos, the North Vietnamese established artillery, rocket, and mortar positions from which to launch attacks by fire on the base and to support its ground operations. The NVA 130mm and 152mm artillery pieces, and 122mm rockets, had a longer range than the Marine artillery support which consisted of 105mm and 155mm howitzers. This range overmatch {{was used by the}} North Vietnamese to avoid counter-battery fire. They were assisted in their emplacement efforts by the continuing bad weather of the winter monsoon.|$|E

As a result of the inquiry, eight more people were accused of witchcraft and committed for trial: Elizabeth Device, James Device, Alice Nutter, Katherine Hewitt, John Bulcock, Jane Bulcock, Alice Grey and Jennet Preston. Preston lived <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>in</b> Yorkshire, so she was sent for trial at York Assizes; the others were sent to Lancaster Gaol, to join the four already imprisoned there.|$|E
5|$|SR 186 {{begins at}} the United States–Mexico border (near Avenue International) in the {{community}} of Los Algodones. The route heads to the northeast along the Alamo Canal and crosses the center of the Fort Yuma-Quechan Reservation.

The highway continues northward, crossing the All-American Canal, where it turns to the north. SR 186 continues northward to an interchange with I-8 in Araz Junction, where the route terminates at the northbound ramps. The route continues northward as locally maintained Araz Road. Near the interchange is a casino operated by the Quechan Native American tribe that opened in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{area near}} the border with Cameroon close to the coast is rich {{rainforest}} {{and part of the}} Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests ecoregion, an important centre for biodiversity. It is habitat for the drill monkey, which is found in the wild only in this area and <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>in</b> Cameroon. The areas surrounding Calabar, Cross River State, also in this forest, are believed to contain the world's largest diversity of butterflies. The area of southern Nigeria between the Niger and the Cross Rivers has lost most of its forest because of development and harvesting by increased population, with it being replaced by grassland (see Cross-Niger transition forests).|$|E

5|$|Coordinating with Lon Nol ARVN forces {{attacked}} the PRG headquarter complexes.

Surrounded they awaited till nightfall and then with security provided by the NLF 7th division they broke out of the encirclement and fled north to unite with the COSVN in the Cambodian Kratie province in what would {{come to be known}} as Escape of the Provisional Revolutionary Government. Trương Như Tảng was the Minister of Justice in the PRG and he recounts that during the march to the northern bases was day after day of forced marches broken up by B-52 bombing raids. Just before the column crossed route 7 on their way north they received word that on 3 April the 9thDivision had fought and won a battle near the city of Krek, Cambodia against ARVN forces.|$|E
5|$|Dodd, {{also known}} as Mullawa or Mulla walla (flying fish), was an Arunta or Arrente Indigenous man from central Australia. It is unclear if Dodd was from the Northern Territory or South Australia: one source states {{he was born in}} Alice Springs, and another states he was born at the Hermannsburg Mission, to the town's south-west. However a third source {{suggests}} Oodnadatta, <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>in</b> South Australia, while Dodd himself, in a 2011 interview, stated he was South Australian. A 1953 newspaper report states that he was from Coober Pedy and had been resident at Colebrook Home, which housed Indigenous children from northern South Australia; some residents subsequently identified as members of the Stolen Generation. The only record of a birth date is in the Department of Veterans' Affairs' Nominal Roll of Australian Veterans of the Korean War, which gives 1 June 1928.|$|E
5|$|In foreign affairs, Walter {{negotiated}} with Scotland in 1195 {{and with the}} Welsh in 1197. Scotland claimed Northumbria, or northern England. Negotiations broke down, but {{relations between the two}} countries remained good throughout the rest of Richard's reign. Talks with the Welsh began after the English lords Roger Mortimer and William de Briouze expanded into Welsh territory in 1195, causing a concern that the Welsh lord Rhys ap Gruffydd would strike back <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>border.</b> <b>In</b> 1196, Walter quickly suppressed a popular uprising in London led by William Fitz Osbern. FitzOsbern was an orator who harnessed the discontent of the poor residents of London against high taxes. His oratory provoked a riot in London, and he was apprehended and hanged on Walter's orders.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{the police}} focused their law {{enforcement}} efforts {{on dealing with}} the illegal consumption of alcohol, which was considered to promote violent behaviour among the First Nations. By the 1880s, however, the police also began to tackle horse theft. Horse stealing was common among the First Nations on the prairies: it formed part of intertribal competition and warfare, and the stolen horses enabled their hunting expeditions. In part the police crackdown was driven by the Department for Indian Affairs, who believed {{that the practice of}} horse theft was slowing the assimilation of the First Nations into broader Canadian society. The authorities were also concerned that if the First Nations were allowed to steal horses from <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>in</b> the United States, it could provoke a military intervention into Canada.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is {{inferential}} and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin {{was born in the}} area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>in</b> modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.|$|E
5|$|M-81 {{starts at}} a {{junction}} with M-13, {{with the two}} directions of each highway separated by a median. This central feature ends for M-81 immediately east of the intersection as the highway runs east out of Saginaw. The trunkline follows Washington Road easterly through residential subdivisions to an interchange with I-75/US23 in an industrial area of Buena Vista Township. This interchange, exit151 along the freeway, is built with roundabouts {{on either side of}} the bridge that carries Washington Road over the freeway in a variant of the diamond interchange design called a dumbbell interchange. After leaving the industrial properties on the east side of I-75/US23, M-81 follows Washington Road through a mixture of farm fields and residential subdivisions. North of the community of Arthur, the highway intersects M-15 (Vassar Road). Further east, M-81 crosses out of Saginaw County; <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>in</b> Tuscola County, the highway follows Saginaw Road.|$|E

His aircraft crashed before landing at Ndola Airport, killing him and everybody else on board. In stark contrast to Hammarskjöld's attempts to pursue a moderate policy in the Congo, his successor U Thant supported a more radical policy of direct involvement in the conflict. Katanga released the captured Irish soldiers in mid-October {{as part of a}} cease-fire deal in which ONUC agreed to pull its troops back—a propaganda coup for Tshombe. Restated American support for the UN mission, and the murder of ten Italian UN pilots in Port-Émpain in November 1961, strengthened international demands to resolve the situation. In December 1961, South Kasai was finally overrun by ANC troops and Kalonji was arrested, ending the South Kasai secession.|$|E
5|$|Sweden {{had just}} lost one third of its population, as Russia had conquered the eastern part and created the Grand Duchy of Finland out of it during the Finnish War in 1808–1809. Shortly after, in 1814, the west flank had been secured by the {{personal}} union with Norway, and after the Napoleonic Wars, the former main enemy of Sweden in the south, Denmark, was no longer any threat. The only threat left was Russia, which now stood just <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>in</b> the north, and had possession of the Åland Islands less than 150km from the Swedish capital Stockholm. The Swedish Navy was considered superior to the Russian in the Gulf of Bothnia, so a seaborne invasion against the coast of Norrland was not likely. And even though the Russians had invaded northern Sweden via Finland in the previous war, the general opinion was that {{in case of a}} new war, their main attack would be conducted towards Stockholm and southern Sweden.|$|E
5|$|On 29 July 1781 Sérurier {{was awarded}} the Order of Saint-Louis. On 10 May 1782 he assumed the rank of captain commandant and on 1 June 1783 he took command of the regiment's Chasseur company. Irked {{by the lack of}} promotion, he asked to retire on pension on 8 September 1788. His {{commanding}} officer argued to retain such a good officer and Sérurier transferred into the Médoc Regiment as a major on 17 May 1789. He became lieutenant colonel on 1 January 1791. Since the French Revolution the garrison at Perpignan became agitated so the regiment was sent there to calm down the other troops. Instead, the Médoc Regiment itself became affected by the troubles. On 23 July 1791, fearing that Sérurier was about to leave the country with the regiment's colors, a body of soldiers removed them from his quarters. In January 1792, 19 officers from the regiment emigrated to Spain. A story existed that Sérurier and a companion tried to flee to Spain but were nearly caught by a patrol and only his companion made it <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>border.</b> <b>In</b> June 1792 the Médoc, renamed the 70th Infantry Regiment, marched to the Camp of Tournoux in the Alps.
