5|$|Scholars use {{a number}} of criteria, such as the {{criterion}} of independent attestation, the criterion of coherence, and the criterion of discontinuity to judge the historicity of events. The historicity of an event also depends on {{the reliability of the}} source; indeed, the gospels are not independent nor consistent records of Jesus' life. Mark, which is most likely the earliest written gospel, has been considered for many decades the most historically accurate. John, the latest written gospel, differs considerably from the Synoptic Gospels, and thus is generally considered less reliable, although more and more scholars now <b>also</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> it may contain a core of older material as historically valuable as the Synoptic tradition or even more so.|$|E

Valuing {{a mix of}} experiences {{in the classroom and}} on campus, increasing diversity at Fairfield is a major goal of the University's Strategic Vision, and in 2005, during the University's Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Holiday Celebration and Convocation, the Rev. Jeffrey P. von Arx, S.J., called on the university to join him in efforts to increase diversity at the institution. [...] For this reason, the Office of Institutional Diversity Initiatives and the Office of Student Diversity Programs were created to pursue a number of initiatives to increase racial and socioeconomic diversity. Both offices <b>also</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that,</b> [...] "there are many dimensions to diversity that go well beyond obvious differences such as race, gender, age, physical ability, and marital status. The less [...] obvious dimensions of diversity include, but are not limited to: veteran status, education, sexual orientation, lifestyle, national origin, religious or political affiliation, departmental or organizational 'culture', and employee status." [...] These diversity initiatives are helped annually by the Fairfield Awards Dinner held in New York City in which funds are raised for The Alumni Multicultural Scholarship Fund. The 2008 Fairfield Awards Dinner raised a record-breaking $1.1 million.|$|E
2500|$|... 13. Men rightly {{observe that}} a {{conjugal}} act imposed on one's partner {{without regard to}} his or her condition or personal and reasonable wishes in the matter, is no true act of love, and therefore offends the moral order in its particular application to the intimate relationship of husband and wife. If they further reflect, they must <b>also</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> an act of mutual love which impairs the capacity to transmit life which God the Creator, through specific laws, has built into it, frustrates His design which constitutes the norm of marriage, and contradicts the will of the Author of life. Hence to use this divine gift while depriving it, even if only partially, of its meaning and purpose, is equally repugnant to the nature of man and of woman, and is consequently in opposition to the plan of God and His holy will. But to experience the gift of married love while respecting the laws of conception is to acknowledge that one is not the master of the sources of life but rather the minister of the design established by the Creator. Just as man does not have unlimited dominion over his body in general, so also, and with more particular reason, he has no such dominion over his specifically sexual faculties, for these are concerned by their very nature with the generation of life, of which God is the source. [...] "Human life is sacred—all men must recognize that fact," [...] Our predecessor Pope John XXIII recalled. [...] "From its very inception it reveals the creating hand of God." ...|$|E
