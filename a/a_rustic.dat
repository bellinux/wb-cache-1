5|$|Historically, {{the grape}} was {{fermented}} and shipped north to Tuscany and Piedmont, {{where it was}} used as a blending grape to enhance the body of thin red wines produced in those areas. When the link between Primitivo and Zinfandel began to emerge, plantings in the region and production of non-blended varietal increased. Today most Italian Primitivo is made as <b>a</b> <b>rustic,</b> highly alcoholic red wine with up to 16% alcohol by volume (ABV). Some Italian winemakers age the wines in new American oak to imitate American-style Zinfandel.|$|E

5|$|The {{physical}} characteristics {{seen in the}} breed are currently in flux, so {{there is not a}} single breed phenotype, though many members of the breed closely resemble the Mérens. Enthusiasts are breeding for <b>a</b> <b>rustic</b> mountain horse, of medium size, with good gaits and good temperament. Some members of the breed closely resemble Iberian horses such as the Andalusian horse. The official breed standard calls for a moderately long neck and long, sloped shoulder, broad back, rounded croup and muscular legs. Some members of the breed are branded on the left hindquarter. Because of its relative rarity and physical similarities, the Castillonnais is commonly confused with the Mérens.|$|E

5|$|The Anonimalle Chronicle gives a clear {{account of}} the unrest in East Anglia. On hearing of the rebellion, Henry le Despenser acted swiftly, moving through Cambridgeshire, Suffolk and Norfolk {{from his home in}} Burley, Rutland. His armed force {{initially}} consisted of his personal retinue, but ultimately became a much larger force consisting of many knights and other men who had previously not dared to confront the rebels. According to the historian Edgar Powell, Henry Dispenser undertook the task of dealing with the revolt in his diocese and punishing the rebels. He was involved in crushing rebellions at Peterborough and elsewhere, before moving on to suppress the revolts in Cambridge. The authorities were alerted to the call in Norfolk for men to join the revolt in the name of Litster. On 17 June the rebels from the north and east of the county assembled on Mousehold Heath, outside Norwich: shortly afterwards, Sir Robert Salle, who had come out of the city to speak with the commons, was killed. According to Thomas Walsingham, the knight died soon after he was 'knocked on the head by <b>a</b> <b>rustic</b> who was one of his own serfs'. The rebels then entered Norwich and wreaked havoc, destroying property and killing several prominent citizens. Other houses and church properties within the county (such as at Yarmouth) were attacked by the rebels at this time.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of its building, the design of Basildon was already old-fashioned. From 1750s onwards large houses were being built without <b>a</b> <b>rustic,</b> and having the {{principal}} floor on the ground was becoming commonplace. Basildon, with its piano nobile, large portico denoting status, and main facade falsely elongated by fenestrated walls, was never innovative architecture, but, like many other houses, was built to bolster the status of its owner, the newly rich Sir Francis Sykes, keen for a political career.|$|E

25|$|Vinalia Rustica (August 19), {{originally}} <b>a</b> <b>rustic</b> Latin {{festival of}} wine, vegetable growth and fertility.

Varro insists that the day was sacred to Jupiter, whose control of the weather governed the ripening of the grapes; but the sacrificial victim, a female lamb (agna), may be evidence that it once belonged to Venus alone.|$|E
