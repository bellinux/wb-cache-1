5|$|The campus has {{a health}} centre with {{residential}} and visiting doctors available <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock.</b> The centre has an ambulance to reach associated hospitals.|$|E
5|$|As the Cultural Revolution {{erupted in}} 1966, Chairman Mao Zedong {{called for the}} {{destruction}} of the Four Olds, and teenage Red Guards rampaged through people's homes to destroy relics of pre-Communist China. Desperate Shanghai collectors sought protection of their antiques at the Shanghai Museum, and Ma slept in his office to take phone calls and to dispatch museum employees <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock.</b>|$|E
5|$|During its {{operational}} life {{two of the}} Cabinet War Rooms were of particular importance. Once operational, the facility's Map Room was in constant use and manned <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> by officers of the Royal Navy, British army and Royal Air Force. These officers were responsible for producing a daily intelligence summary for the King, Prime Minister and the military Chiefs of Staff.|$|E
50|$|The going train sits {{on top of}} <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> and <b>the</b> {{striking}} {{train is}} below. This used to be <b>the</b> other way <b>around,</b> before <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> was converted to have a pendulum.|$|R
50|$|A tellurion (also spelled tellurian, tellurium, and {{yet another}} name is loxocosm), is a clock, {{typically}} of French or Swiss origin, surmounted by a mechanism that depicts how day, night and the seasons are caused by {{the movement of the}} Earth on its axis and its orbit <b>around</b> <b>the</b> sun. <b>The</b> <b>clock</b> normally also displays the age of the moon, and the four-year (perpetual) calendar.|$|R
50|$|In the 1990s seventy {{five percent}} of <b>the</b> <b>clocks</b> {{produced}} were exported <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world. <b>The</b> <b>clocks</b> were all manufactured in the Oswestry factory until 2003 when production moved to Asia, benefiting from lower manufacturing costs and higher production capacities.|$|R
5|$|SS-Begleitkommando des Führers ("Escort Command of the Führer") was {{an elite}} SS {{protection}} unit formed in February 1932 as Hitler's protection escort while travelling. The unit consisted of eight men who served <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> protecting Hitler. Later the SS-Begleitkommando was expanded and {{became known as}} the Führerbegleitkommando ("Führer Escort Command"; FBK). It continued under separate command and remained responsible for Hitler's personal protection.|$|E
5|$|Students {{and alumni}} {{flocked to the}} Polo Fields, working <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock,</b> to rebuild the Bonfire {{in time for the}} game. It was {{completed}} only hours before it was scheduled to burn. After the 1994 Bonfire was burned, two tons of lime were spread on the Polo Fields to stabilize the ground. This layer hardened to a consistency similar to concrete.|$|E
5|$|During the war Zinn {{allowed it}} to be run <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock,</b> and its design {{made it easy to}} conduct experiments. This {{included}} tests to investigate the properties of isotopes such as tritium and determine the neutron capture cross section of elements and compounds that might be used to construct future reactors, or occur in impurities. They were also used for trials of instrumentation, and in experiments to determine thermal stability of materials, and to train operators.|$|E
50|$|Robins {{is in the}} north-west, and has self-catering {{accommodation}} {{and camping}} sites but no other facilities. The camp is based <b>around</b> <b>the</b> old <b>clock</b> tower of <b>the</b> farm of Harold Robins, donated to the park in 1939.|$|R
50|$|On {{the higher}} {{part of the}} façade, above the columns, there {{is a series of}} molding and {{elliptical}} openings, which are also decorated in palm leaves <b>around</b> <b>the</b> perimeter. <b>The</b> <b>clock</b> is at <b>the</b> centre and, at each end, there are Gothic obelisks. Comparisons of the façade of the monastery with the work of Italian architects Sebastinao Serlio and Andrea Palladio suggests that the architect of the church was probably inspired by them.|$|R
50|$|Great Harwood {{used to have}} {{a lively}} and bustling market <b>around</b> <b>the</b> town <b>clock</b> in <b>the</b> main square. It was very popular, and drew people from across the county every week. It has {{declined}} in the last 15 years and almost disappeared, but having seen a small resurgence is now (May 2017) usually only a single stall which arrives every Friday with fruit, vegetables, fish, meat, clothes and pet supplies.|$|R
5|$|Hardware stores {{experienced}} great {{demand for}} portable generators, chain saws, dehumidifiers, and air movers following {{the passage of}} the hurricane. Utility crews from across the country came to the state to assist in returning power, though power outages persisted for several days. Over 2,500 utility members worked, in some cases <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock,</b> to restore the power. One power company restored power to 68% of its affected customers by the day after Isabel passed through the area. By four days after landfall, 83,000 customers were without power, down from its peak of several hundred thousand.|$|E
5|$|Somervell still pursued his own designs, making {{important}} changes, {{including the}} addition of a fifth story. The outbreak of war led to a new urgency, and by May 1942, some 13,000 workers were working <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> on the building, which was completed in early 1943 at a cost of $63 million, the overrun being caused by the emphasis on speed and {{the addition of}} the extra floor. For his work with the Construction Division, Somervell was awarded an oak leaf cluster to his Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E
5|$|The Island {{has its own}} radio station, BRFM 95.6 FM is Community Radio Station, {{which can}} also be heard online at www.brfm.net that {{broadcasts}} 24 hours a day, 7 days a Week from Minster-on-Sea. BRFM in October 2011 was granted a 5-year extension to its broadcast licence by regulator Ofcom and will remain broadcasting to Swale until 2016. The station is run by 20 volunteers. BRFM 95.6 plays {{a wide range of}} music, with news, weather and local events being broadcast <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock,</b> the station also provides for specialist music during weekday evenings.|$|E
50|$|In a clock shop, {{there is}} a fun-styled cuckoo-like <b>clock</b> called <b>the</b> Tickety Toc <b>Clock.</b> As every hour passes, two figures come out near the top: a boy named Tommy playing his drums, and a girl named Tallulah playing her trumpet. A dog-shaped train named Pufferty also runs <b>around</b> on <b>the</b> <b>clock's</b> rails. However, unlike most clocks, it {{features}} a magical world called Tickety inside it; thus Tommy, Tallulah, and Pufferty would come alive and hang out there with their friends between the hours. Things don't always run smoothly.|$|R
50|$|Both <b>the</b> aluminium-based quantum <b>clock</b> and <b>the</b> mercury-based optical {{atomic clock}} track {{time by the}} ion {{vibration}} at an optical frequency using a UV laser, that is 100,000 {{times higher than the}} microwave frequencies used in NIST-F1 and other similar time standards <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world. Quantum <b>clocks</b> like this are able to be far more precise than microwave standards.|$|R
50|$|The wooden effigy of Peeping Tom which, from 1812 until World War II {{looked out}} on the world from a hotel at the {{northwest}} corner of Hertford Street, Coventry, can now be found in Cathedral Lanes Shopping Centre. It represents a man in armour and was probably an image of Saint George. Nearby, in the 1950s rebuilt Broadgate, an animated Peeping Tom watches over Lady Godiva as she makes her hourly ride <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Godiva <b>Clock.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{disaster}} led {{to major}} changes in maritime regulations to implement new safety measures, such as ensuring that more lifeboats were provided, that lifeboat drills were properly carried out and that radio equipment on passenger ships was manned <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock.</b> An International Ice Patrol {{was set up to}} monitor the presence of icebergs in the North Atlantic, and maritime safety regulations were harmonised internationally through the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS); both measures are still in force today.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes of}} Kirk and Scott {{approaching}} the Enterprise in drydock spanned two pages of script but took forty-five different shots—averaging one shot a day—for the travel pod containing Kirk {{to make its}} flight from the space office complex to the docking ring. Double shifts <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> were required to finish the effect on time. For close shots of the pod traveling to the Enterprise, close-ups of Shatner and Doohan were composited into the model, while in long shots lookalike puppets were used.|$|E
5|$|Although St. Lucia {{suffered}} {{significant damage}} to its residential structures and agricultural land, its airports and hotels were operational within days having needed only small-scale repair work. Hospitals and other essential services kept running on standby power supplied by independent generators {{to assist in}} the cleanup and recovery efforts. Roads connecting the north and south of the island were quickly cleared. LUCELEC, the nation's only electricity provider, worked <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> to repair dozens of downed electrical poles and restored electricity by August 21. The rest of the island's infrastructure weathered the storm. Two shelters were opened for hurricane-affected residence, and USAID/OFDA provided US$40,432 of assistance to the island.|$|E
50|$|Bordertown {{is home to}} the {{historic}} Clayton Farm Heritage Museum. It is also famous for its white Kangaroos which have been bred for zoos and animal shelters <b>around</b> Australia. <b>The</b> lightning <b>clock</b> on <b>the</b> main street marks the site of the first electricity source.|$|R
5000|$|Cable clocks are wound by {{inserting}} a special crank (called a [...] "key") into holes in <b>the</b> <b>clock's</b> face and turning it. Others, however, are chain-driven, {{meaning that the}} weights are suspended by chains that wrap <b>around</b> gears in <b>the</b> <b>clock's</b> mechanism, with <b>the</b> {{other end of the}} chain hanging down next to the weight. To wind a chain-driven longcase clock, one pulls on the end of each chain, lifting the weights until the weights come up to just under <b>the</b> <b>clock's</b> face.|$|R
5000|$|The Ottoman Turkish {{engineer}} Taqi al-Din {{described a}} weight-driven clock with a verge-and-foliot escapement, a striking train of gears, an alarm, and {{a representation of}} the moon's phases in his book The Brightest Stars for the Construction of Mechanical Clocks (Al-Kawākib al-durriyya fī wadh' al-bankāmat al-dawriyya), written <b>around</b> 1565. [...] <b>The</b> <b>clock</b> also displayed <b>the</b> zodiac.|$|R
5|$|Communications {{with the}} outside world went through a single Forest Service line until April 1943, when it was {{replaced}} by five Army telephone lines. This was increased to eight in March 1945. There were also three teletypewriters with encoding machines. The first was installed in March 1943, and two more were added in May 1943. One was removed in November 1945. There were telephones in the offices, but none in private residences, as the Army regarded this as a security hazard. There were some public phones in the township for emergencies. Since {{there was no way to}} prevent the lines being tapped, classified information could not be discussed over the phone lines. Initially the phone lines were operable only during business hours until enough WACs arrived to man the switchboard <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite {{estimates}} that Yorktown, damaged in the Battle of the Coral Sea, would require {{several months of}} repairs at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, her elevators were intact and her flight deck largely so. The Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard worked <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock,</b> and in 72 hours she was restored to a battle-ready state, judged good enough {{for two or three}} weeks of operations, as Nimitz required. Her flight deck was patched, and whole sections of internal frames were cut out and replaced. Repairs continued even as she sortied, with work crews from the repair ship , herself damaged in the attack on Pearl Harbor six months earlier, still aboard.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of its investigation, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{discovered}} that tower staffing levels at Blue Grass Airport violated an internal policy as reflected in a November 16, 2005, memorandum requiring two controllers during the overnight shift: one in the tower working clearance, ground, and tower frequencies, and another, either in the tower or remotely at Indianapolis Center, working TRACON (radar). At {{the time of the}} accident, the single controller in the tower was performing both tower and radar duties. On August 30, 2006, the FAA announced that Lexington, as well as other airports with similar traffic levels, would be staffed with two controllers in the tower <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> effective immediately.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of an {{interior}} {{view of the}} trading floor of the Los Angeles Stock Exchange empty of people, [s. d. ]. Benches {{can be seen at}} center back-to-back, while two desks can be seen at left and two at right. Smaller desks line the wall, while {{what appears to be a}} balcony extends <b>around</b> <b>the</b> walls. <b>Clocks</b> can be seen on the wall at left and at right, while a pattern is visible on the ceiling. In size - 6, 580 square feet - it is second only to the New York Exchange...|$|R
50|$|When he appears, {{it is as}} {{a figure}} so immense that a {{supernova}} is a mere gleam {{in his eyes and}} he takes a whole page to say YES. His size suggests that he may, in fact, be the universe itself. He also appears to be the keeper of what is logically the opposite of a clock, in that it tells Time what it is, and not <b>the</b> other way <b>around.</b> Azrael's connection with the personification of Time (currently the combination of Lobsang Ludd and his temporal double Jeremy Clockson) is unknown. Statements of <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> seem to indicate that it {{is a measure of the}} life of the entire universe (the Universe hand only goes <b>around</b> once). <b>The</b> <b>clock</b> also bears a minute hand, a millennium hand, and an eon hand.|$|R
2500|$|The song reached {{number one}} in the charts in 28 countries. In most countries, it was Meat Loaf's first and only number one solo single. It was {{number one in}} the US for five weeks and sold over 1.4 million copies there. In the UK, it topped the singles chart, and at seven minutes and 52 seconds, [...] "I'd Do Anything for Love" [...] {{becoming}} the longest song on top there since The Beatles' hit [...] "Hey Jude". This was then broken when Oasis released their 1997 hit [...] "All <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> World", <b>clocking</b> in at 9 minutes and 20 seconds.|$|R
5|$|On September 6, 1901, Leon Czolgosz, an {{unemployed}} factory worker and registered Republican {{with a history}} of mental illness, shot US President William McKinley twice during a public speaking event in Buffalo, New York. McKinley was hit in the breastbone and stomach, and died eight days later. Czolgosz was arrested, and interrogated <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock.</b> During interrogation he claimed to be an Anarchist and said he had been inspired to act after attending a speech held by Goldman. The authorities used this as a pretext to charge Goldman with planning McKinley's assassination. They tracked her to a residence in Chicago she shared with Havel, as well as Mary and Abe Isaak, an anarchist couple. Goldman was arrested, along with Isaak, Havel, and ten other anarchists.|$|E
5|$|Since Smyth {{still had}} his {{commitments}} at Princeton and Chicago, he could only work on the report part-time. He wrote the report {{in his office in}} Princeton's Palmer Laboratory. Bars were installed on the windows of Smyth's office and the one adjacent to it. The hallway door to his office was locked and blocked by a large safe so that the only access was through the adjacent office, where there was an armed guard. The guards worked in eight-hour shifts, and one was present <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock.</b> When Smyth sent papers to Groves in Washington, D.C., they went by military courier.|$|E
5|$|Solar power {{tends to}} be {{complementary}} to wind. On daily to weekly timescales, high pressure areas tend to bring clear skies and low surface winds, whereas low pressure areas tend to be windier and cloudier. On seasonal timescales, solar energy peaks in summer, whereas in many areas wind energy is lower in summer and higher in winter. Thus the seasonal variation of wind and solar power tend to cancel each other somewhat. In 2007 the Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the University of Kassel pilot-tested a combined power plant linking solar, wind, biogas and hydrostorage to provide load-following power <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> and throughout the year, entirely from renewable sources.|$|E
5000|$|Apart {{from his}} direct {{contributions}} to Toodyay, Demasson indirectly {{contributed to the}} renaming of Newcastle to Toodyay. Around 1908 or earlier, he had ordered a French domed ormolu clock from London, but it was mistakenly delivered to Newcastle, New South Wales [...] as were many items <b>around</b> that time. <b>The</b> <b>clock</b> was unclaimed in New South Wales, but chanced upon by John Forrest (then serving in Federal parliament), who knew Demasson and realised that <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> {{had been sent to}} the wrong Newcastle. This incident is known to have contributed to the call for changing the town's name to Toodyay.|$|R
50|$|Head coach Jim Valvano {{was noted}} for {{employing}} a then-little used strategy late in games. The NCAA {{had yet to}} adopt a shot clock for college basketball, and as the games wore on some teams were just content to keep possession of the ball late in games to protect a lead, passing <b>the</b> ball <b>around</b> until <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> hit zero. Valvano would instruct his players to intentionally foul opposing players, thus putting them on the free-throw line. While this strategy was risky, as it allowed NC State's opponents a chance to increase their lead, it enabled the Wolfpack to extend the game as each foul stopped <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> and <b>the</b> team could also capitalize if the opponents missed their free throws. They used this to great effect in the ACC tournament, including against rival North Carolina and Virginia, and employed it again in four of their six NCAA victories. Nowhere was the strategy more widely seen, however, than in the national championship game.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the topmost}} {{chamber of the}} last of a row of somber gray stone houses in Adam Street a girl with a thin but {{beautiful}} face and large, expectant eyes sat close to the bare, uncurtained window, from which it was possible to command a view of the street below. A book which she had apparently been reading had fallen neglected onto the floor. Steadfastly she watched the passers-by. Her delicate, expressive features were more than once illuminated with joy, only to be clouded, a moment later, with disappointment. The color came and went in her cheeks, as though, indeed, she were more sensitive than her years. Occasionally she glanced <b>around</b> at <b>the</b> <b>clock.</b> Time dragged so slowly in that great bare room with its obvious touch of poverty! ...|$|R
