5|$|Parker {{made several}} changes from Gerolmo's {{original}} draft. He omitted the Mafia hitman {{and created the}} character Agent Monk, a black FBI specialist who kidnaps Tilman. The scene in which Frank Bailey brutally beats a news cameraman {{was based on an}} actual event; Parker and Colesberry were inspired by a news outtake found during their research, in which <b>a</b> <b>CBS</b> <b>News</b> cameraman was assaulted by a suspect in the 1964 murder case. Parker also wrote a sex scene involving Rupert Anderson and Mrs. Pell. The scene was omitted during filming after Gene Hackman, who portrays Anderson, suggested to Parker that {{the relationship between the two}} characters be more discreet. By January 4, 1988, Parker had written a complete shooting script, which he submitted to Orion executives. Gerolmo did not visit the production during principal photography, due to the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike.|$|E

30|$|To {{test the}} null {{hypothesis}} of the true asset pricing model (FFC-model) {{it is necessary to}} form portfolios of stocks that have similar characteristics but different risk factor exposures. They are referred to as characteristics-balanced (CB) portfolios (Daniel and Titman 1998). <b>A</b> <b>CB</b> portfolio goes long (short) in a portfolio of stocks with high (low) factor loadings while the characteristics of both portfolios are nearly equal. If there is a linear relation between risk exposures and returns (and the risk premium is positive) then <b>a</b> <b>CB</b> portfolio should have a positive average return. A positive average return of <b>a</b> <b>CB</b> portfolio cannot be due to differences in the characteristics as there should be no differences in the firm characteristics in <b>a</b> <b>CB</b> portfolio. In contrast, if the average return on <b>a</b> <b>CB</b> portfolio is zero we should reject the FFC-model because there is no linear relation between exposures and asset returns.|$|R
