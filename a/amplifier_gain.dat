40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} optimal {{spectrum sensing}} in cognitive radio networks considering its system level cost {{that accounts for}} the local processing cost of sensing (sample collection and energy calculation at each secondary user) {{as well as the}} transmission cost (forwarding energy statistic from secondary users to fusion center). The optimization problem solves for the appropriate number of samples to be collected and <b>amplifier</b> <b>gains</b> at each secondary user to minimize the global error probability subject to a total cost constraint. In particular, closed-form expressions for optimal solutions are derived and a generalized water-filling algorithm is proposed when number of samples or <b>amplifier</b> <b>gains</b> are fixed and additional constraints are imposed. Furthermore, when jointly designing the number of samples and <b>amplifier</b> <b>gains,</b> optimal solution indicates that only one secondary user needs to be active, i. e., collecting samples for local energy calculation and transmitting energy statistic to fusion center.

25|$|Most {{amplifiers}} {{are designed}} to be linear. That is, they provide constant gain for any normal input level and output signal. If an <b>amplifier's</b> <b>gain</b> is not linear, the output signal can become distorted. There are, however, cases where variable gain is useful.

2500|$|First the loaded {{open-loop}} gain is found. The feedback {{is turned off}} by setting g12 = g21 = 0. The idea is to find how much the <b>amplifier</b> <b>gain</b> is changed because of the resistors in the feedback network by themselves, with the feedback turned off. This calculation is pretty easy because R11, RB, and rπ1 all are in parallel and v1 = vπ. Let R1 = R11 // RB // rπ1. In addition, i2 = −(β+1) iB. The result for the open-loop current gain AOL is: ...|$|E

40|$|This paper studies {{cooperative}} {{spectrum sensing}} in cognitive radio networks where secondary users collect local energy statistics and report their findings to a secondary base station, i. e., a fusion center. First, the average error probability is quantitively analyzed {{to capture the}} dynamic nature of both observation and fusion channels, assuming fixed <b>amplifier</b> <b>gains</b> for relaying local statistics to the fusion center. Second, the system level overhead of cooperative spectrum sensing is addressed by considering both the local processing cost and the transmission cost. Local processing cost incorporates the overhead of sample collection and energy calculation that must be conducted by each secondary user; the transmission cost accounts for the overhead of forwarding the energy statistic computed at each secondary user to the fusion center. Results show that when jointly designing the number of collected energy samples and transmission <b>amplifier</b> <b>gains,</b> only one secondary user needs to be actively engaged in spectrum sensing. Furthermore, when number of energy samples or <b>amplifier</b> <b>gains</b> are fixed, closed form expressions for optimal solutions are derived and a generalized water-filling algorithm is provided...|$|R
