5|$|Defeating monsters earns the {{character}} experience points, and after earning enough points, {{the character}} will gain an experience level, improving their hit points, magic capability, and other attributes. Monsters may drop treasure to be looted. On the other hand, the character dies {{if they lose}} all their hit points. As most roguelikes feature the concept of permadeath, this represents {{the end of the}} game, and the player will need to restart the game with a newly made character. Roguelikes are nearly always turn-based, with the game only reacting when the player makes an action with the character. This allows players to evaluate a difficult situation, such as being cornered by several monsters, <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>pace</b> and determine the best strategy.|$|E

5|$|The Albany Free School is {{the oldest}} independent, inner-city {{alternative}} school in the United States. Founded by Mary Leue in 1969 based on the English Summerhill School philosophy, the free school lets students learn <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>pace.</b> It has no grades, tests, or firm schedule: students design their own daily plans for learning. The school is self-governed through a weekly, democratic all-school meeting run by students in Robert's Rules. Students and staff alike receive one equal vote apiece. Unlike Summerhill-style schools, the Albany Free School is a day school that serves predominantly working-class children. Nearly 80 percent of the school is eligible for reduced-price meals in the public schools. About 60 students {{between the ages of}} three and fourteen attend, and are staffed by six full-time teachers and a number of volunteers.|$|E
5|$|Augie March {{returned}} to the studio in 2004 to record a follow-up to Strange Bird. The band worked with two producers, Paul McKercher and Eric Drew Feldman, and recorded in Melbourne, San Francisco, and their own studio in Nagambie, Victoria. Donovan said it was more suited to the band's style; as they co-produced on all their albums, they took {{a great deal of}} interest in production. He said it also enabled them to work <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>pace,</b> hence the four-year gap between releases. They released a DVD, Drones & Vapid Ditties, containing live performances and music videos, in mid-2004. The band's upcoming album, according to Triple J, was inspired by the streets of Melbourne. Upon completion of the initial recording sessions of Moo, You Bloody Choir, there was a six-month delay before release, as Augie March meticulously added finishing touches to it. In March 2006, the album was finally released.|$|E
5|$|Midtown Madness {{features}} 4 single-player modes: Blitz, Circuit, Checkpoint, and Cruise. In Blitz, {{the player}} must swing through 3 checkpoints {{and drive to}} the finish line within a time limit. The Circuit mode curtains off most of the city to resemble race tracks and pits the player against other cars. The Checkpoint mode combines the features of Blitz and Circuit has the player race against other cars to a destination—but also adds the complication of other traffic, such as police cars and pedestrians. In the Cruise mode, the player can simply explore the city <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>pace.</b> All of these modes except Cruise are divided into missions; completing one unlocks the next. Environmental conditions that traverse all modes include weather (sunny, rainy, cloudy, and snowy), time of day (sunrise, afternoon, sunset, and night-time), and the density of pedestrians, traffic, and police vehicles. The heads-up display includes, alongside information about the race, a detailed map, but this display can be turned off.|$|E

2500|$|Accordingly, the schoolroom was {{equipped}} with child-sized furnishings, [...] "practical life" [...] activities such as sweeping and washing tables, and teaching material that Montessori had developed herself. Children were given freedom to choose and carry out <b>their</b> <b>own</b> activities, <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>paces</b> and following <b>their</b> <b>own</b> inclinations. In these conditions, Montessori {{made a number of}} observations which became the foundation of her work. First, she observed great concentration in the children and spontaneous repetition of chosen activities. She also observed a strong tendency in the children to order <b>their</b> <b>own</b> environment, straightening tables and shelves and ordering materials. As children chose some activities over others, Montessori refined the materials she offered to them. Over time, the children began to exhibit what she called [...] "spontaneous discipline".|$|R

5|$|The {{game has}} the player {{controlling}} the main character, Amaterasu, in a woodcut, watercolor style, cel-shaded environment, {{which looks like}} an animated Japanese ink-illustration (known as ink wash painting, sumi-e) with other styles of art. The gameplay style {{is a mix of}} action, platform, and puzzle gaming genres, and has been noted by many reviewers to have numerous similarities in overall gameplay style to The Legend of Zelda series, an inspiration that director Hideki Kamiya, a self-proclaimed Zelda-fan, has admitted has influenced his general game design. The main story is primarily linear, directed through by Amaterasu's guide Issun, though numerous side quests and optional activities allow for players to explore the game world and take the story <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>pace.</b> By completing quests, side quests and small additional activities (such as making trees bloom into life or feeding wild animals), Amaterasu earns Praise, which can then be spent to increase various statistics of the character, such as the amount of health and number of ink wells for Celestial Brush techniques.|$|E

25|$|Some Neo-Marxists {{believe that}} it would {{actually}} be best for periphery countries to cut all economic and political ties with the core countries.

Doing this would allow these countries to spend their money on industrializing and bettering themselves, rather than importing goods from core countries. It also would allow these countries to become more independent from the core countries, causing them to move to semi-peripheral status.|$|E

The programme was initiated in 1999 but scrapped in 2006. Since then, e-learning has been integrated into the school calendar. It is often used by teachers during holidays during term time, for instance on Staff Training Days during term time when students are not required to attend lessons; instead, teachers attend courses held in the campus.|$|E

A student who completes a course of study under the programme is awarded a University of London degree with a notation specifying which lead college provided the instruction.|$|E
25|$|One of Montessori's many accomplishments was the Montessori method. This is {{a method}} of {{education}} for young children that stresses {{the development of a}} child's own initiative and natural abilities, especially through practical play. This method allowed children to develop <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>pace</b> and provided educators with a new understanding of child development. Montessori's book, The Montessori Method, presents the method in detail. Educators who followed this model set up special environments {{to meet the needs of}} students in three developmentally-meaningful age groups: 2–2.5 years, 2.5–6 years, and 6–12 years. The students learn through activities that involve exploration, manipulations, order, repetition, abstraction, and communication. Teachers encourage children in the first two age groups to use their senses to explore and manipulate materials in their immediate environment. Children in the last age group deal with abstract concepts based on their newly developed powers of reasoning, imagination, and creativity.|$|E
25|$|The Netflix {{model has}} also {{affected}} viewers' expectations. According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60% of Americans said they binge-watch shows and nearly {{eight out of}} 10 Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule. Netflix has successfully continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes {{at a time of}} their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>pace.</b> Netflix has capitalized on these habits by automatically playing the next episode in the series, removing the 15-second wait times of content on other streaming services. The structure that allows convenient viewing of episodes, as well as the intent to provide content of quality comparable to some broadcast and cable television programs, in effect often results in the viewer being hooked into the program by the time the next episode starts.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the authors}} {{examined}} {{the influence of}} the intrinsic dynamics of discrete and rhythmical prehension. Six adults underwent a scaling procedure in which the movement time was systematically increased so that it corresponded with 6 frequencies: 0. 5, 0. 75, 1. 0, 1. 25, 1. 5, and 1. 75 Hz. In posttests, participants moved <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> preferred <b>pace.</b> No differences were found in the relative time to final hand closure (Trfc) between the rhythmical and discrete conditions. The variability of Trfc was shown to be less at the preferred step of scaling than during the posttest. With the scaling technique, one can guide participants into more stable movement patterns than they can achieve when the metronome is not present, because, when the metronome is present, their movements become anchored to the external pacing cue. Those findings provide support for the use of a scaling technique to identify {{the influence of the}} intrinsic dynamics during rhythmical and discrete movements...|$|R
25|$|The game {{contains}} a central hub level, the Royal Train Station, and four additional levels that the player travels to through the Train Station. Each level was designed {{with a number}} of puzzles that allowed the player to approach in any order, while keeping the level size small and uncomplicated to prevent the player from becoming lost. Most of the puzzles have been designed with multiple solutions; Petty stated they wanted to cater to both the casual player, who may only want to find one of the solutions to progress in the game, and the more dedicated player, who would likely spend time to discover all of the intended solutions. This was furthered by allowing the player to freely roam through previously-completed areas to complete all the puzzles, including after completing the main story. The puzzles and challenges were designed {{to be able to be}} completed in short segments, giving the player more freedom to play it <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>pace.</b> Petty wanted to make sure the player had time to contemplate the puzzles or explore the environment in a manner of older adventure games, though still assured that his environments felt alive and animated. The levels themselves are designed using a mix of the Great Depression and Victorian era designs, using virtual household items such as marbles and safety pins, an inspiration that came from interest in dioramas and miniature stages. The game itself presents cutscenes with dialog in the fashion of early silent films, where a text plaque is shown to show the dialog after it is acted out and scene takes place on a theater stage.|$|E

Spears early on cultivated a mixture of innocence and experience that broke the bank". Barbara Ellen of The Observer has reported: [...] "Spears is famously one of the 'oldest' teenagers pop has ever produced, almost middle aged in terms of focus and determination. Many 19-year-olds haven't even started working by that age, whereas Britney, a former Mouseketeer, was that most unusual and volatile of American phenomena— a child with a full-time career. While other little girls were putting posters on their walls, Britney was wanting to be the poster on the wall.

40|$|We compare three open {{universities}} the Open Universities in the UK (OUUK), the Netherlands (OUNL) and Japan (OUJ). Originating in {{the modern}} idea of an Open University each university has developed its own pedagogical model. The OUUK developed Supported Open Learning based on: 1. Distance open learning: allowing ‘learning in your own time’ working on set activities and assignments. 2. Quality resources: printed materials, set books, audio and video and home experiments. 3. Systematic support: provided by course tutors, a regional network of centers, central library and technical support. The OUNL offers ‘supported independent open learning’. Students study <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> time, <b>pace</b> and place. There are no semesters, academic years or student cohorts.
