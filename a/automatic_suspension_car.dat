50|$|In the United States, {{citation}} fines {{can vary}} widely between jurisdictions {{for the same}} behaviour, usually between $25 and $1000. In countries such as Finland, however, they are specific proportions of the violator's income, and fines in excess of $100,000 can be assessed to wealthy individuals. In Canada, each province is individual in how they treat similar behaviour and each violation usually includes a set fine and demerit points against the driver's license. For example, a speeding ticket in Ontario of 50+ km over is 6 demerit points against the driver's licence with the approximate fine calculated as (km over x 9.75) x 1.25, as well it carries a one-week <b>automatic</b> licence <b>suspension</b> and <b>car</b> impoundment. In Manitoba speeding in excess of 49 km is 8 demerit points and a fine of 557 dollars.|$|R
50|$|In Victoria, Australia {{the driver}} of the car has the option to refuse the drug test.

The second refusal triggers an <b>automatic</b> <b>suspension</b> and disqualification for a period of 4 years and an even larger fine.|$|R

Readings lower than this {{have the option of}} a 10-point penalty being imposed of being taken immediately to court; this option still results in a minimum four-month suspension for novice drivers. <b>Automatic</b> <b>suspensions</b> apply for higher level charges, and re-licensing may require an order to install an interlocking device onto the vehicle. <b>Automatic</b> <b>suspension</b> periods of at least 1 month also apply for speeding by greater than 25 km/h over the speed limit, or any speed greater than 130 km/h.|$|R

40|$|Zero {{tolerance}} {{policies have}} been defined as school disciplinary practices that mandate <b>automatic</b> <b>suspension</b> and/or expulsion from school with the effect of redefining “students as criminals, with unfortunate consequences” (Martin, 2001, p. 1).

5000|$|On January 31, 2005, she {{was arrested}} by the Ohio State Highway Patrol for DUI. Several motorists had used cell phones to call in a Jeep Grand Cherokee showing erratic driving. State police confronted her in a gas station and she refused a field sobriety test, {{resulting}} in the one-year <b>automatic</b> <b>suspension</b> of her license. After refusal, she ignored police orders to remain {{at the gas station}} and drove off. She was pulled over a few minutes later and failed a sobriety test. Justice Resnick registered a Blood Alcohol Concentration of 0.22, nearly three times the legal limit in the state of Ohio. A dashboard camera recorded the incident, and much of the audio showing Justice Resnick trying to use her office {{to get out of the}} DUI charge appeared on the internet. She was convicted of DUI, a first degree misdemeanor, required to take a three-day alcohol education program, and her license was suspended for six months, overriding the <b>automatic</b> <b>suspension</b> of one year. She was not charged with failure to comply with a police officer, resisting arrest, or fleeing from police. A new state law also implemented a mandatory jail sentence for offenders who refuse a sobriety test and show greater than a 0.17 BAC. The incident and penalty sparked a wave of public criticism, especially after portions of the 90-minute videotape surfaced on various internet video websites.|$|R
