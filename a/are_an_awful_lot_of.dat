40|$|Background: It {{has been}} found that {{patients}} have expressed favourable attitudes towards hospital settings (Weinstein, 1979) but more recently, evidence from service user feedback has indicated the experience of psychiatric admission can be felt to be neither safe nor therapeutic (Department of Health, 2002). There has been lack of qualitative research exploring individuals’ experiences of psychiatric admission in the context of acute psychosis. Aims: The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the experience and perceptions of psychiatric admission for individuals with psychosis using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Method: Five participants with psychosis who were currently admitted to <b>a</b> psychiatric ward <b>were</b> interviewed using <b>a</b> semi-structured interview. Results: Three super ordinate themes emerged, which were labelled: “I feel like a, a prisoner in here…”, “‘ [...] my life is in their hands [...] ” and “There <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> of stigma put on mental health patients [...] . ” Conclusions: The emergent themes suggested individuals felt imprisoned, disempowered and experienced a sense of loss due to their admission but also due to their experiences of psychosis. This was also accompanied by a lack of awareness and understanding from others, which resulted in feelings of stigma but acceptance within hospital. The themes are discussed in relation to previous research and current Government and National Health Service (NHS) initiatives. Declaration of interest: Non...|$|R
40|$|South Africa’s widely commended Truth & Reconciliation Commission has a blind spot. Surprisingly, no {{attention}} {{appears to have}} been given to the foreign corporations, individual investors and Western governments that helped create and sustain the racial dictatorship which {{came to be known as}} apartheid. The Cape Town-based Alternative Information & Development Centre (AIDC) undertook a study and produced a report on a strategy for challenging the foreign debt incurred during the apartheid era but which democratic South Africa is now expected to pay. The Report, located in the search for truth and reconciliation in South Africa, seeks to address the omission of apartheid’s international face. Post-apartheid South Africa has inherited a foreign debt of $ 18. 7 billion (some R 90 billion). The dominant view amongst economists and politicians is that this sum presents no special problem. According to the measures most economists use in such matters the foreign debt <b>is</b> not <b>a</b> course for concern. The AIDC’s Report challenges this complacency on three grounds. First, R 90 billion <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> of money for the vast majority of South Africans who, in varying degrees, remain deprived of the basic necessities of life. Any unnecessary and unjustifiable diversion of resources away from meeting these needs has to be opposed and stopped.

Linda is not alone—hundreds of thousands of individuals who are currently suffering with the burning, sharp, aching pain and the potential disability of RSD, now known as Complex Regional Pain Syndrome Type 1 (CRPS), understand the losses that accompany the horrific pain. Although measuring pain is subjective, the losses are measurable, and often substantial. One prospective study of 829 patients with CRPS in the Netherlands reported that the syndrome <b>is</b> <b>a</b> major cause of disability because only one in five patients was fully able to resume prior activities. 2 A recent web-based epidemiological survey of CRPS conducted by RSDSA, in conjunction with the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, corroborated the findings of Dr. Veldman et al that CRPS results in a high incidence of disability from work, continuing intense pain, sleep disturbance, and suicidal ideation. 3 CRPS can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> very difficult syndrome to treat, especially if treatment is offered piecemeal rather than in an interdisciplinary fashion as recommended. Our goal in writing these guidelines {{is to make sure that}} those individuals suffering with CRPS receive the proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

Dr. Norman Harden, the contributing authors, and our review editors have attempted to write these guidelines based chiefly on evidence-based medicine. We dedicate these guidelines to people with CRPS, their families and support people, and the medical professionals who accept the challenge of treating this poorly understood, perplexing syndrome...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} reasons for examining “non-standard data” with CL methods {{are the facts}} that this data represents {{a great deal of}} language behavior and that it serves as an object of scientific study in linguistics as <b>a</b> whole. This <b>is</b> true of the syntax of non-native second-language learners, the accents of non-native speakers, and the vocabularies of different dialect speakers. Computational linguists have a good deal to offer to the various subfields of linguistics studying non-standard data. By automating steps in analysis we make the analyses replicable and also modifiable, we improve opportunities for comparing similar analyses, and perhaps {{most important}}ly, we enable the analyses of large amounts of data, providing more comprehensive views. The data itself can be tricky to work with, however, as scientists in other fields are often specialized in a single language or language pair, which means that their data will not be varied enough to support all the research questions one would like to ask, e. g., the question of the generality of the techniques for a particular purpose. In other cases, the data simply won’t have <b>been</b> collected with <b>an</b> eye to answering some interesting questions, which may mean that important parameters haven’t been recorded. Finally, we note that non-automated analyses do not impose expectations that data be commensurate to the same strict degree (as automated ones), meaning that surprises can be in store even in well-studied data sets. This paper provides some concrete examples and discussion of these potential pitfalls. One can protect oneself from some of these risks by seeking collaboration with domain experts, which is to be recommended in any case, as a way of making the work richer and better informed.
