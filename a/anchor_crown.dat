50|$|Indian Mound Mall {{opened in}} 1986 {{as the first}} indoor {{shopping}} mall in Licking County. Its original anchor stores were Elder-Beerman, J. C. Penney, and Lazarus, {{as well as a}} Hills acting as a secondary <b>anchor.</b> <b>Crown</b> Cinema, located {{in the rear of the}} mall, was added in 1988. A fountain that had originally been in the center of the mall was removed in 1997. Also in 1997 the mall added Sears, replacing a freestanding store nearby, and the Crown Theaters was expanded from six screens to eleven, becoming a Hollywood Theater shortly thereafter. In 2016, Hollywood Theater was bought out by AMC Theatres. In 1998 Elder-Beerman was expanded, adding 20000 sq ft.|$|E

50|$|In 1519 a {{petition}} to Charles I of Spain, headed by Juan Rodríguez Mafra, requested the grant of a coat of arms to the Pinzóns and other mariners of Palos, exposing the lamentable situation of the descendants of those mariners who had offered such service to the Crown. The king finally conceded to the Pinzóns, their descendants and family members a coat of arms consisting of a shield with three caravels, natural, on the sea; from each a hand points to an island representing the first land discovered in the New World. Around that, a border with <b>anchors</b> and <b>crowns.</b>|$|R
50|$|The anchor coinage was {{a series}} of four {{denominations}} of silver coins issued for use in some British colonies in 1820 and 1822. The name comes from the <b>crowned</b> <b>anchor</b> that appears on the obverse of the coins. The denominations were sixteenth, eighth, quarter and half dollars, indicated by the Roman numerals XVI, VIII, IV and II {{on each side of the}} anchor. The reverse design was the royal coat of arms.|$|R
5000|$|The Green and Sea Point {{municipal}} council assumed {{a coat of}} arms in 1901. [...] The shield was divided vertically, one half depicting signal masts on Signal Hill, the other a golden lion's head, shoulders and forepaws; in the centre, near the top, was a small blue shield displaying three <b>anchors.</b> An imperial <b>crown</b> was placed above the shield. The coat of arms has been incorporated into the emblem of the Metropolitan Golf Club.|$|R
60|$|In the evening, {{especially}} when the sailors are gathered in great numbers, these streets present a most singular spectacle, {{the entire population of}} the vicinity being seemingly turned into them. Hand- organs, fiddles, and cymbals, plied by strolling musicians, mix with the songs of the seamen, the babble of women and children, and the groaning and whining of beggars. From the various boarding-houses, each distinguished by gilded emblems outside--an <b>anchor,</b> a <b>crown,</b> a ship, a windlass, or a dolphin--proceeds the noise of revelry and dancing; and from the open casements lean young girls and old women, chattering and laughing with the crowds {{in the middle of the}} street. Every moment strange greetings are exchanged between old sailors who chance to stumble upon a shipmate, last seen in Calcutta or Savannah; and the invariable courtesy that takes place upon these occasions, is to go to the next spirit-vault, and drink each other's health.|$|R
5000|$|While APB {{actively}} supports responsible drinking {{through their}} ‘drink-savvy’ campaign, a popular pastime of expatriates living in Hainan {{is to take}} part in the ‘APB Challenge’. Founded by longtime Hainan expatriate James Farquhar, the first APB challenge took place following a 'Hash House Harrier' event in Sanya on June 22, 2009. APB Hainan produces 5 types of Anchor Beer, 2 types of Tiger Beer (regular Tiger and Tiger Crystal), 2 types of Hainan Beer and Heineken, totaling 10 different beers. Only two are available in cans (<b>Anchor</b> Red <b>Crown</b> and <b>Anchor</b> Lite), only some in 330 ml bottles but all in 600 or 550 ml [...] "big" [...] bottles. The APB challenge is to find and drink all 10 types of the big-bottle versions in one day. From 2012 the challenge has become increasingly difficult as some product lines (Anchor 97 and Anchor ‘Classic’) are only available in rural villages outside of the main population centers of Haikou and Sanya.|$|R
60|$|She {{carried a}} long, rusty gun, on a swivel, amid-ships; and that gun was a curiosity in itself. It {{must have been}} some old veteran, {{condemned}} by the government, and sold for any thing it would fetch. It was an antique, covered with half-effaced inscriptions, <b>crowns,</b> <b>anchors,</b> eagles; and it had two handles near the trunnions, like those of a tureen. The knob on the breach was fashioned into a dolphin's head; and by a comical conceit, the touch-hole formed the orifice of a human ear; and a stout tympanum it must have had, to have withstood the concussions it had heard.|$|R
25|$|In August 1974, {{construction}} of the main level commenced. Using 45 hydraulic jacks attached to cables strung from a temporary steel <b>crown</b> <b>anchored</b> {{to the top of}} the tower, twelve giant steel and wooden bracket forms were slowly raised, ultimately taking about a week to crawl up to their final position. These forms were used to create the brackets that support the main level, as well as a base for the {{construction of}} the main level itself. The Space Deck (currently named SkyPod) was built of concrete poured into a wooden frame attached to rebar at the lower level deck, and then reinforced with a large steel compression band around the outside.|$|R
5000|$|After the {{position}} of Mayor become Lord Mayor in 1902, the first Lord Mayor, Thomas Hughes, suggested that the council apply for a grant of arms from the College of Arms in London. The heraldic designer William F. Ward submitted a new design, which included the ship, supporters and motto from the earlier version, but also included elements of the arms of Thomas Townshend and Captain Cook, {{as well as the}} <b>crown,</b> <b>anchor</b> and six-pointed star as a crest. The ship was now on a gold over blue background, symbolising the [...] "Golden South". When the arms were approved by the heralds on 30 July 1908, the arms of Thomas Hughes had been added, along with a helmet and mantling above the shield.|$|R
5000|$|An iconic post {{military}} {{watch and}} {{a result of}} the Navy's FSX-797, colloquially known as the US Navy's Bureau of Ships [...] "canteen watch", started out with Jacques Depollier & Sons's waterproof and dustproof strap watch. The first known example of the now common [...] "screw down crown", unlike later examples of the canteen watch, this one lacked the emblematic chain <b>anchoring</b> the <b>crown</b> to the watch. One unusual feature of this watch was the heat disk {{on the back of the}} case to prevent the heat from the wearer's wrist from causing the oil in the watch to drip out of the jewel holes. Depollier ads claim that the US Army Signal Corps used the case to protect watch movement stores in long-term storage. The gasketed and spring-loaded screw-down crown is kept on the case by two flanges on the crown held against two grooves on the case. [...] US Navy Bureau of Ships specification 18W8, published in December 1944. A matte black metal dial, two vertical luminous dots over 12, along with one for every other hour, the hour and minute hand, as well as the tip of the second hand covered in radium lume. With war shortages, the case was made of chromed base metal. A koroseal gasket is used inside the crown. The crystal is tempered glass with a metal rim soldered to the case creating a watertight seal. The 17-jewel sweep-second movement is covered by another koroseal gasket under the caseback.|$|R
