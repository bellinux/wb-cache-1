Our journey is not {{complete}} until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law—for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.|$|E
500|$|LGBT social movements, {{which include}} the Gay and Lesbian Rights Movement, Gay Liberation, lesbian feminism, and {{transgender}} activism, have often garnered celebrity endorsement from many entertainers including Jackson. She has often voiced her support for same-sex marriage, advocating all {{people have the right}} to fall in love. In 2008, Jackson appeared in a public service announcement sponsored by the Logo television network and the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) in response to the E.O. Green School shooting. The announcement discusses the murder of fifteen-year-old Lawrence [...] "Larry" [...] King and the safety of LGBT youth in public schools. Jackson states that [...] "none of us are safe, until <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> safe". On April 26, 2008, fellow gay icon Ellen DeGeneres presented Jackson with the Vanguard Award at the 19th Annual GLAAD Media Awards at the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|Glenn Kenny of Premiere {{criticized the}} film's {{time-shifting}} narrative and multiple storylines, saying it [...] "yields heretofore undreamed of levels of narrative incoherence". Kenny praised the film's look, saying the [...] "cheez-whizziness" [...] that others had criticised was [...] "precisely the point". He remarked the movie inspires even more thinking than The Matrix {{because of its}} [...] "blatantly anti-capitalist storylines". Similarly, The New Yorkers Anthony Lane said the film could still end up [...] "bleached of fun" [...] due to the theme mooted in The Matrix that <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> being controlled. In Speed Racer, Lane argues, this {{comes in the form}} of villain Royalton, who [...] "vows to crush [...] with 'the unassailable might of money.'" [...] He concluded some people may call it entertaining, but he [...] "felt [...] like Pop fascism". Jim Emerson, editor at the Chicago Sun-Times, wrote that Speed Racer [...] "is a manufactured widget, a packaged commodity that capitalizes on an anthropomorphized cartoon of Capitalist Evil in order to sell itself and its ancillary products". It was said to be [...] "the most tiresome piece of CGI (...) [...] " [...] of the [...] "past couple of years" [...] at the time of film's release by Philip French, a The Guardian critic.|$|E

2500|$|Rickman said: [...] "I {{can only}} guess at the {{pressures}} of funding an independent theatre company in New York, but calling this production [...] "postponed" [...] does not disguise {{the fact that it}} has been cancelled. This is censorship born out of fear, and the New York Theatre Workshop, the Royal Court, New York audiences - <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> the losers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meck was {{probably}} {{well aware that}} she was hard to tolerate. She wrote to Tchaikovsky, [...] "I am very unsympathetic in my personal relations because I do not possess any femininity whatever; second, I {{do not know how}} to be tender, and this characteristic has passed on to my entire family. [...] <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> afraid to be affected or sentimental, and therefore the general nature of our family relationships is comradely, or masculine, so to speak." ...|$|E
2500|$|Four years later, in {{his report}} to the nation on The Points of Light Movement, President Bush said, [...] "Points of Light are the soul of America. They are {{ordinary}} people who reach beyond themselves to touch {{the lives of those}} in need, bringing hope and opportunity, care and friendship. By giving so generously of themselves, these remarkable individuals show us not only what is best in our heritage but what <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> called to become." ...|$|E

2500|$|On February 16, {{thousands}} of Bahrainis {{took part in}} the funeral procession of Al-Matrook while others were camping in Pearl Roundabout for the second day in a row. The funeral began in Salmaniya medical complex and ended in Mahooz graveyard. Al-Matrook's coffin was covered with Bahrain's flag. The funeral began at 8:30 am, and mourners that took part carryed pictures for Al-Matrook, Bahrain flags, and black flags which represent grief. They chanted [...] "No god but Allah, the martyr is loved by Allah" [...] and [...] "No Sunni, No Shia, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> one united Bahrain".|$|E

She {{had already been}} working with Habitat for Humanity and Starkey Hearing Foundation, and she {{attended}} the Do Something Awards to become involved with charities that help fight domestic violence and bullying. Reinhart explains [...] "I've been the counselor {{to a lot of}} my friends growing up, so helping people comes naturally to me. That’s what <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> meant to do: send out good vibes, good messages and help out." [...] On December 5, 2011, Reinhart performed at the 4th Annual Holiday Tree Lighting at L.A. Live. The event served as a fundraiser to help end hunger and homelessness locally and to support health care services for the needy.|$|E

2500|$|Sanders rarely {{speaks about}} religion. He {{describes}} himself as [...] "not particularly religious" [...] and [...] "not actively involved" [...] with organized religion. A press package issued by his office states [...] "Religion: Jewish". He has said he believes in God, though not necessarily in a traditional manner: [...] "I think everyone believes in God in their own ways," [...] he said. [...] "To me, it means that <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> connected, all of life is connected, {{and that we are}} all tied together." [...] In October 2015, on the late-night talk show, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Kimmel asked Bernie, [...] "You say you are culturally Jewish and you don't feel religious; do you believe in God and do you think that's important {{to the people of the}} United States?"

2500|$|In 2008, Singer Edu Falaschi was {{originally}} reported {{as saying that}} Angra [...] "has been terminated," [...] but this was later revealed to be both a misunderstanding and a misreporting of his words. [...] Edu later clarified what was meant by his earlier comments: [...] "Angra is not done; we're taking a break, a pause. The band is going through some difficult management issues, and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> doing our best {{to get back on}} the road." [...] In 2009, the band's official site was taken down. Instead, the home page announced that the site was under construction and news would be released soon. In March 2009, the band's official site announced the return of drummer Ricardo Confessori after a 9-year hiatus to Angra, replacing Aquiles Priester, who left the band to dedicate full force to his band Hangar. The band went out on tour along with fellow Brazilian band Sepultura during 2009.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2009, Carter said {{he could}} not [...] "ensure" [...] another movie would be made, but thought the {{international}} box office for the 2008 film made it at least a theoretical possibility. In an interview published in August 2012, Spotnitz said he was talking up the idea of an X-Files movie every chance he got, but that there was still nothing happening on that front, and that time was running very short for a third movie concluding the original X-Files franchise to be made at all. [...] He blamed the poor performance of the 2008 film on {{the fact that it was}} not about aliens. Speaking at San Diego Comic-Con International in July 2013, Carter, when asked about a third film, was extremely non-committal, indicating there was still no forward movement, and saying, [...] "We can get to it later." [...] On August 2013, Carter said, in an interview with Empire, that [...] "It's really up to 20th Century Fox, whether they have the will to do it. I think <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> interested in putting the band back together", adding that a third installment would be a return to the mythology and that the colonisation date of the television series would not be ignored.|$|E

2500|$|By May 19, rumors {{were still}} being spread. Many people {{believed}} that the slayer had been caught. Some of them believed he was being held at the Bowie County Jail surrounded by Texas Rangers with submachine guns on their knees. Others believed he was flown to an out-of-town jail. The Gazette and News offices were drowned with phone calls, both local and long distance, inquiring about the apprehension of the killer. [...] "Newspapers Will Tell Public If Killer Is Caught", read one of the sub-headlines of the May 19th edition of Texarkana Gazette. Sheriff Presley declared that innocent people were being accused of being the Phantom and asked the residents to show more consideration for their fellow citizens. Presley stated, [...] "These rumors positively are not true. We can understand why the people believe them. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> tense and are hopeful that at any hour officers will announce they have the killer in custody. The people must not become so anxious to rid themselves of the killer, however, that they brand innocent persons as the murderer and believe unfounded stories. The investigating officers have announced that when and if the killer is apprehended or killed the public will be given the full story through the newspapers. We reaffirm this statement. The newspapers are kept posted on developments in the investigation and they will announce all news immediately. We believe that the {{people have a right}} to know if the killer is caught or killed and we pledge ourselves to let the public have this information." ...|$|E
