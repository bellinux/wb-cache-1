5000|$|Dysdiadochokinesia, dysdiadochokinesis, dysdiadokokinesia, dysdiadokokinesis (from Greek δυς dys [...] "bad", διάδοχος diadochos [...] "succeeding", κίνησις kinesis [...] "movement"), often {{abbreviated}} as DDK, is {{the medical}} term for an impaired {{ability to perform}} rapid, alternating movements (i.e., diadochokinesia). Complete inability is called <b>adiadochokinesia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Onset of {{symptoms}} usually occur in early adulthood and {{is characterized by}} intention tremor, progressive ataxia, convulsions, and myoclonic epileptic jerks. Tremors usually affect one extremity, primarily the upper limb, and eventually involve the entire voluntary motor system. Overall, the lower extremity is usually disturbed less often than the upper extremity.Additional features of the syndrome include: an unsteady gait, seizures, muscular hypotonia, reduced muscular coordination, asthenia, <b>adiadochokinesia</b> and errors with estimating range, direction, and force of voluntary movements. Mental deterioration can occur, however it is rare.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A 70 -year-old man {{developed}} a slowly progressive cerebellar syndrome {{after having been}} exposed to carbon disulfide (CS 2) in a viscose rayon plant for 27 years. Ataxia, dysmetria, dysarthria and <b>adiadochokinesia</b> appeared 7 years after retirement from work (at age 54), and were later accompanied by cognitive deterioration, dysmnesia, spatio-temporal disorientation, emotional lability, and paranoid-obsessive disturbances. Brain computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed advanced global cerebellar atrophy, {{and a picture of}} less severe cerebrocortical atrophy. The case illustrates the possibility of chronic toxic encephalopathy among patients with previous long-term exposure to CS 2. In such instances, cerebellar damage may develop as an exceptional, delayed manifestation of neurotoxicity: brain imaging techniques can significantly contribute to the diagnosis and follow-up, in addition to occupational anamnesis and neuropsychiatric evaluation. The patient presented also serves as a remainder that neurodegenerative disorders of apparently unknown origin sometimes derive from occupational toxic exposures suffered in the past. The clinical manifestations may appear several years after retirement from work, when the effects of toxic damage combine with age-related neuronal loss to overcome the brain functional reserve...|$|E
