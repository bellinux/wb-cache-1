5|$|A weary emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, discontent among ruling circles who were dismissive of the Imperial role in {{national}} affairs: <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> to presage the monarchy's impending doom. Nevertheless, Pedro II was unconcerned that times and conditions were changing. After more than five decades on the throne, he had become complacent in a belief that the devotion and support of his subjects was immutable. Because of these factors, and the lack of an energetic response on the part of Pedro II, {{it has been argued that}} prime responsibility for the monarchy's overthrow rested with the Emperor himself.|$|E

25|$|Now that <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> lost, the West Indian fielding, which {{until now}} had been fallible in both innings, reached the heights. Three {{of the last}} four batsmen were run out in what had by now become a race against time.

25|$|<b>All</b> <b>seemed</b> {{lost for}} England until a defiant Jack Russell, ably {{supported}} by spinner John Emburey set about first blunting, {{and then when}} the opportunity arose, attacking the Australian bowlers. It was slow going, and often dourly defensive, but Russell and Emburey weathered the Australian attack, and set about adding to the total when they could. By stumps they had crawled along to 123 for 6, Russell not out on 47 and Emburey on 22. A vital partnership of 64 restoring some credibility to an England team threatening to collapse completely.|$|E

25|$|Sir John Evans {{never changed}} his mind, {{giving rise to}} a dichotomous view of the Mesolithic and a {{multiplication}} of confusing terms. On the continent, <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> settled: there was a distinct Mesolithic with its own tools and both tools and customs were transitional to the Neolithic. Then in 1910, the Swedish archaeologist, Knut Stjerna, addressed another problem of the Three-Age System: although a culture was predominantly classified as one period, it might contain material {{that was the same}} as or like that of another. His example was the Gallery grave Period of Scandinavia. It was not uniformly Neolithic, but contained some objects of bronze and more importantly to him three different subcultures.|$|E
25|$|A {{remaining}} {{abundance of}} food and fuel ruled {{out the possibility that}} the men might have died from starvation or exposure. It was long believed that the men had died from scurvy; an ailment caused by lack of vitamin C, and common in polar regions. The men were generally berated as ignorant and careless. Some parts of the historical evidence were not consistent with death from scurvy, however. First of all, the men <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> to have fallen ill at the same time, which would have been peculiar if scurvy had been the cause. Secondly, the diary shows that the group was familiar with the dangers of contracting scurvy, and how to avoid it. Death from tuberculosis, or botulism were other theories.|$|E
25|$|One {{of those}} {{irregularities}} {{is related to}} juror No. 12. During the trial he violated his oath on several occasions and was referred to by Anand Jon’s lawyers as hardly an impartial juror. Although prohibited, juror No. 12 had discussed the case with his tenant and told her he felt the girls on the stand <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to have the same}} or similar stories, and that he was under the impression they had all collaborated. Due to his fellow jurors’ anger towards him, juror No. 12 felt he was pressured to give a verdict that he didn’t want to give. Also, during deliberations, several jurors complained to the judge that juror No. 12 was refusing to properly deliberate and had made up his mind about the evidence. Although the jury foreman had requested that juror No. 12 be removed for refusal to deliberate, it was denied by Judge Wesley.|$|E

25|$|After {{moving to}} Moscow, Pisemsky joined The Russian Messenger {{as the head}} of the {{literary}} department. In 1866, on the recommendation of Interior minister Pyotr Valuyev, he became a local government councilor, the job providing him the financial independence he was craving for. Being now a well-paid author and a thrifty man, Pisemsky was able to build his fortune enough to enable him to leave work both at the magazine and the government office. In the late 1860s he bought a small piece of land on Borisoglebsky Lane in Moscow and built himself a house there. <b>All</b> <b>seemed</b> well, but only on the face of it. Troubled Seas (1863) and Russian Liars (1864) were his last critically acclaimed works. Then came the political drama The Warriors and Those Who Wait (1864) and the dramatic dilogy Old Birds (1864), and Birds of the Latest Gathering (1865), followed by the tragedy Men Above the Law, as well as two historical plays, full of melodramatic turns and naturalistic elements, Lieutenant Gladkov and Miloslavskys and Naryshkins (both 1867).|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 24 June, the six RMPs of 156 Provost Company, were in Majar al-Kabir {{as part of the}} {{training}} programme for the local Iraqi police. The NCO in charge of the RMP section was Sergeant Simon Hamilton-Jewell, who had informed his Royal Military Police chain of command that he was leaving and where he and his section would be going. Despite a Standing Order that everyone be issued with a satellite phone for communication, Hamilton-Jewell was informed that none were available. The RMPs had gone to Majar al-Kabir to ask why the local police force had not intervened in a stoning two days earlier. The RMPs left Camp Abu Naji at 9:10am local time and arrived in Majar al-Kabir twenty to thirty minutes later between 9:30 and 9:40am. They were due to move on to other locations at Qalat Salih and Al Uzayr (at 14:00 to meet a senior British officer) before returning to their base around 17:00. When they arrived at the police station, their Iraqi interpreter was waiting for them and <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> calm.|$|E
25|$|In 1920, {{after the}} end of the First World War, Sassoon {{returned}} to Baghdad from Istanbul and was appointed Minister of Finance in the first Iraqi government, a new provisional government under the premiership of Abd Al-Rahman Al-Naqib. The importance of his role was what was to make or break the new constitution of Iraq. The details of this were highlighted by Gertrude Bell when she recounted the circumstances regarding the establishment of Iraq’s new government. Dated 1 November 1920, Bell wrote:“On Wednesday morning <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> to be going well. In the afternoon Major Yetts and I went out sightseeing in Baghdad and on our way home dropped in to tea with the Tods. Mr Tod sprung upon us that he had called on Sasun Eff to congratulate him on his becoming Minister of Finance and found him with Hamdi Pasha Baban (who had been offered a seat in the Cabinet without portfolio,) both in the act of refusing. Mr Tod had done his best to persuade them but had heard in the afternoon that they had refused, the real, though not the expressed reason, being that they would not join a Cabinet which contained Saiyid Talib.|$|E

500|$|From {{the third}} season {{to the sixth}} season, the mysterious Syndicate was {{explored}} in detail. In the two part episode [...] "Two Fathers"/"One Son", the Syndicate was destroyed. The plan to eliminate the Syndicate and relaunch the series' mythology {{in a new direction}} was originally conceived in September 1998. Director Kim Manners stated [...] "I've said for years that the show really resolved itself, if you will, by accident. The whole story line of the Syndicate and the bees and the aliens and the chips in the neck, they <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> to just accidentally fall into place and create an intriguing, mysterious storyline that eventually got so mysterious and so intriguing that Chris had to blow it up, because he couldn't deal with it anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|Jeremy Egner of The New York Times {{criticized the}} episode in his review, writing, [...] "It's just {{not all that}} satisfying. After endless weeks of stick-beating and the events of last week, it <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> a little too tidy," [...] and {{additionally}} called Arya's story [...] "anticlimactic." [...] However, Egner also praised the episode's continuation with the King's Landing story, {{as well as the}} follow up with Sandor Clegane and the Brotherhood Without Banners. TV Guides Damian Holbrook criticized as implausible the fact that Arya, after being stabbed multiple times in the previous episode by the Waif, was able to outrun and kill her faster, stronger nemesis in this episode. Hanh Nguyen of Indiewire also felt the Riverrun sequence ended in an anticlimactic fashion as well.|$|E

[...] Thousands of well‑wishers gathered at various points along the train route taking pictures, cheering and waving American flags and homemade signs, with Obama reciting his trademark rejoinder [...] "Iloveyou back" [...] to the enthusiastic crowds.
