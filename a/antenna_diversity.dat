25|$|Cooperative {{diversity}} is a cooperative multiple antenna technique for improving or maximising total network channel capacities {{for any given}} set of bandwidths which exploits user diversity by decoding the combined signal of the relayed signal and the direct signal in wireless multihop networks. A conventional single hop system uses direct transmission where a receiver decodes the information only based on the direct signal while regarding the relayed signal as interference, whereas the cooperative diversity considers the other signal as contribution. That is, cooperative diversity decodes {{the information from the}} combination of two signals. Hence, {{it can be seen that}} cooperative {{diversity is}} an <b>antenna</b> <b>diversity</b> that uses distributed antennas belonging to each node in a wireless network. Note that user cooperation is another definition of cooperative diversity. User cooperation considers an additional fact that each user relays the other user's signal while cooperative diversity can be also achieved by multi-hop relay networking systems.|$|E

One {{of the ways to}} exploit the multiple antenna configurations is to use <b>antenna</b> switching <b>diversity.</b> <b>Antenna</b> switching <b>diversity</b> is used in wireless systems to combat the effect of fading, as we can combine multiple independent copies of the same signal into a total signal with high quality. In this work, we implement and compare the performance of two systems, <b>antenna</b> switching <b>diversity</b> system and single-input single-output (SISO) system. We firstly study the performance of the <b>antenna</b> switching <b>diversity</b> system as we increases the number of antennas compared to the performance of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or gain of the system. The performance of <b>antenna</b> switching <b>diversity</b> is studied on several difference configurations such as receive diversity where there are multiple receive <b>antennas,</b> and transmit <b>diversity</b> where the there are multiple transmit antennas. The study is performed on eight (8) antenna switching, on either the transmit or receive side.

40|$|Abstract—A {{miniature}} spiral <b>diversity</b> <b>antenna</b> system {{operating at}} 1. 85 GHz is proposed.

50|$|<b>Antenna</b> <b>diversity</b> is {{especially}} effective at mitigating these multipath propagation situations.

50|$|Considering <b>antenna</b> <b>diversity,</b> in many systems {{additional}} antennas may {{be expensive}} or impractical at the remote or {{even at the}} base station.

5000|$|Diversity techniques: To {{improve the}} quality of the {{received}} signal, often two receiving antennas are used, placed at a distance equal to an odd multiple of a quarter of the corresponding wavelength.

40|$|Abstract- In {{communication}} systems, we have {{to increase}} {{the reliability of the}} communication operation between transmitter and receiver while maintaining a high spectral efficiency. The ultimate solution relies in the use of diversity, which {{can be viewed as a}} form of redundancy [1]. Multiple-input multipleoutput systems include a variety of techniques capable of not only increasing the reliability of the communication but also impressively boost the channel capacity. In addition, smart antenna system can increase the link quality and lead to appreciable interference reduction. Smart antenna technology is one of the most vital developments in mobile communication. The signal that is been transmitted by a smart antenna cannot be tracked or received by any other antenna thus ensuring a very high security of the data transmitted.
