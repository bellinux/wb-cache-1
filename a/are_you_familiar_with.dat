40|$|Many animal shelters {{across the}} country have noticed that black dogs are not adopted as quickly as lighter colored dogs. This trend goes even further as a dog that is all black is not adopted as quickly as a black dog with one white toe or other small white flashing. Therefore, the {{objective}} {{of this study was to}} determine the reasons why an adopter chose a black dog over other colors. This study was performed at the Animal Rescue League (ARL) of Iowa, located in Des Moines IA. A total of 13 canine records were used in this study. The dogs that qualified for this data set had been 100 % black (solid). The three questions asked of each adopter were as follows; (1) What attracted you to a black dog? (2) Have you had a black dog before? and (3) If no to question 2, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> a black dog from friends’ family or the neighborhood? In addition, the type, age, sex and how long that dog was at the ARL was also collected. A variety of dog breeds were involved in the study with the most popular all black dog breed being classified as a Labrador mix (8) respectively. What attracted you to a black dog? The most commonly cited reason for why a black dog was being adopted was based on appearance (n = 4). Next, breed (n = 2), color did not matter (n = 2) and previous ownership (n = 2) were cited. “Other” (n = 3) included an emotional connotation “he is big and smart” “I felt lucky” and “I love black dogs. ” Have you had a black dog before? Of the 13 responses, 8 said that they had owned a black dog in the past (Figure 1). If no to question 2, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> a black dog from friends’ family or the neighborhood? Of the 13 responses, 12 were familar with a black dog before. Therefore in conclusion, the most common reason cited for adopoting a black dog was based on dog apperance. Even though 8 out of 13 adopters had owned a black dog before, previous ownership was only cited twice. Furthemore, the majority of adopters were familiar with a black dog and it could be hypothezied that this interaction was favorable...|$|E

40|$|Intent – The {{purpose of}} this {{presentation}} is to {{provide an overview of}} current and emerging research methods used in fields such as economics and political science, which combine qualitative inquiry with modeling and statistical analysis to measure and generate explanations for human behaviors on a large scale. This includes the use of fuzzy sets, contrarian case analysis to model complexity theory/multiple realities, and analysis of structural associations to understand multi-layer problems. Argument – In response to calls to study occupation on a larger scale, and to then apply this knowledge to solve real-world problems (Frank, 2015), we must seek research methods that will lend legitimacy to our work and help us think about complex issues in a systematic manner. Importance to Occupational Science – Rather than re-inventing the wheel (or in this case, the analytical tools), it behooves us to look to other fields that deal with the complex nature of human behavior, motivation, transactions, and decision-making at organizational and community levels. In this presentation, ways in which such phenomena are studied using big data, in combination with qualitative and theoretical grounding, will be explored and critiqued. Following this review, applications of these methods to current problems in occupational science will be suggested. Conclusion – While a full tutorial on using big data to answer social questions {{is beyond the scope of}} this presentation, it is expected that this discussion will spur occupational scientists to think critically about our current research methods, and about how we might incorporate statistical concepts and ideas from other fields to enhance our work, as we move from individual and small-group analysis toward “looking behind Door # 4. ” Key words: Data Analysis, Interdisciplinary, Statistics Questions to Facilitate Discussion – What other questions related to occupation came to mind as the analytic methods were discussed? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> any other methods that might be useful to answer questions at population or global levels of analysis?
