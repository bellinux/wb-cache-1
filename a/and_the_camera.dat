5|$|The ASAT test mission, {{the final}} {{flight of the}} High Virgo missile, was {{conducted}} on September 22, 1959. Less than a minute after {{the launch of the}} missile from its B-58 carrier aircraft at Mach 2, the telemetry signal was lost. No data was recovered from the test, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> data, intended to be recovered afterward, was not located. Hence the test was inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|The film {{returns to}} the opening scene. Tommy breaks down in tears but stops crying when, upon {{catching}} sight of a mirror, he sees the image of Marty standing behind him. He finishes dressing for the fight and, as {{he walks to the}} ring, hears Stephanie calling to him. He turns to her; they smile. He resumes his walk to the ring <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> pulls back to reveal that he is dressed in Marty's old ring robe in tribute.|$|E
5|$|The poem is a {{detailed}} description of several objects, including a photo album <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> that took the pictures in it, and is essentially about the nostalgia that the speaker, presumably Gibson himself, feels towards the details of his family's history: the painstaking descriptions of the houses they lived in, the cars they drove, and even their pets.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the American Corona spacecraft, {{the return}} capsule carried both <b>the</b> film <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>and</b> {{kept them in}} a {{temperature}} controlled pressurised environment. This simplified <b>the</b> design <b>and</b> engineering of <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> system but added considerably to {{the mass of the}} satellite. An advantage was that cameras could be reused.|$|R

5|$|To {{capture the}} straight-on {{shot of the}} shower head, the camera had to be {{equipped}} with a long lens. The inner holes on the shower head were blocked <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> placed a sufficient distance away so that the water, while appearing to be aimed directly at the lens, actually went around and past it.|$|E
5|$|Batman: Arkham Asylum is an action-adventure game {{viewed from}} the third-person perspective. The playable {{character}} is visible on the screen <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> can be freely rotated around him. The player controls Batman as he traverses Arkham Asylum, a secure facility for the criminally insane located {{off the coast of}} Gotham City. The opening areas of the game are linear, serving as a tutorial for the moves and approaches available to the player. Once the player emerges onto the island he can freely explore the game world, although some areas remain inaccessible until certain milestones in the main story. Batman can run, jump, climb, crouch, glide from heights using his cape, and use his grapple gun to climb low structures or escape to higher ledges.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to religious allusions, the crew used color schemes and camera movements {{to create their}} own themes for the characters. Since the show was told from Clark's point of view, particular visual elements were utilized to illustrate a particular characteristic. When he was safe at home the colors used to illustrate the environment were warm and gentle, with an earth tone, while the camera movement was gentle as well. When Clark was keeping his secret, but there was no danger around, the lighting was more neutral, with greater camera movement. When there was danger, the lighting became colder with more grays and blues, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> shifted to a handheld, allowing more extreme angles.|$|E
50|$|Both <b>the</b> SLR/c <b>and</b> <b>the</b> SLR/n were officially {{discontinued}} by Kodak on May 31, 2005, although remaining stock {{would be}} sold <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> would be fully supported through 2008. Kodak cited poor profitability of the sector in its announcement.|$|R

5|$|The footage shows Jamal and Muhammad {{crouching}} {{behind the}} cylinder, the child screaming {{and the father}} shielding him. Jamal appears to shout something {{in the direction of}} the cameraman, then waves and shouts {{in the direction of the}} Israeli outpost. There is a burst of gunfire <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> goes out of focus. When the gunfire subsides, Jamal is sitting upright and injured and Muhammad is lying over his legs. Enderlin cut a final few seconds from the footage that shows Muhammad lift his hand from his face. This cut became the basis of much of the controversy over the film.|$|E
5|$|The sex scene {{involving}} Rourke and Bonet {{was filmed}} {{in one of}} the unused buildings located on Royal Street and took four hours to shoot. Parker limited the crew down to himself, cinematographer Michael Seresin, camera operator Michael Roberts <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> assistant. To make the actors more comfortable, Parker played music during the shoot. Production then moved to a corner of New Orleans, which doubled for flashback sequences set in 1943 Times Square, New York. The crew then discovered an unused bus depot, which was used to film scenes set in Ethan Krusemark's gumbo hut. Filming then moved to the St. Alphonsus Church, where the crew filmed a dialogue scene between Angel and Cyphre. Production returned to Royal Street in the French Quarter, where the final confrontation between Angel and Cyphre, and the film's ending were shot.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} showing the world {{evolving}} from its genesis. Images of volcanoes erupting, dinosaurs and tidal waves flash by to show Madonna {{and her two}} backup dancers singing the song while standing on a hill. It continues in this fluid motion up to the intermediate verse when Madonna is shown crawling under the waves and spirals. As the song moves towards the bridge again, the scene changes from the mountains to a cityscape. Madonna and her dancers are shown dancing and singing the song on a skyscraper. The video ends with Madonna standing on the building <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> autofocusing out of the panel.|$|E

50|$|Some shots require <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> to move. This {{can be done}} several ways, one {{of which}} is to use a camera crane. There are many types of camera cranes, most being a counterbalanced arm on a pivot, whilst others are hydraulic. Cranes can be used to lift <b>the</b> <b>camera,</b> <b>and</b> often <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> {{operator}} <b>and</b> assistant also, quickly into the air. The crane operator sets up <b>and</b> operates <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> crane so that <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> arrives at <b>the</b> right spot. This can be difficult since <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> may be a long distance from the operator.|$|R
5|$|It {{begins with}} a shot of Wade's face and the guitar introduction. He then sings {{the first line of}} lyrics, which is {{followed}} by a transition to a boy lying on a bed shirtless. As the video switches between Wade and the boy, it zooms on the bed frame (which has the same face from the album cover) and opens into another area. The boy is then seen walking around the new area looking around until he goes up nearby stairs. While going up the stairs, the video switches between shots of the boy going up the stairs and Wade singing the lyrics. Once up the stairs, the boy looks around and then walks into a bright light that he sees nearby. He walks through the bright archway into a dark room as the video switches to Lifehouse playing the song. After this, it switches to the boy as he looks up <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> zooms out to reveal that he is in a giant maze. He then walks back where he came from to find that he is in a house with Lifehouse playing on the television. He then jumps off a window sill and appears tiny as he walks up to a book that is bigger than him. It then transitions to Lifehouse playing the song as the boy gets up on a chair which slowly transcends into his original bed. The video then zooms out on the boy lying on his bed and then switches to the band. It ends with the boy walking into darkness and Wade's face looking on the floor.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphics}} {{have been}} improved from Diamond and Pearl. The dialog boxes of previous games {{have been changed}} to speech balloons that appear over other characters' heads, allowing more than one character to speak at once. Japanese players can have kanji appear on screen, rather than only hiragana and katakana. During battles, the sprites of the Pokémon are fully animated <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> changes position to highlight specific parts of the battle. In addition to continuing the day and night cycle introduced in Gold and Silver, Black and White introduces a seasonal cycle, with the seasons advancing every month rather than being linked to the calendar. Outside areas appear differently depending on the season, such as changing of leaves in autumn or snow on the ground in winter. Certain areas are only accessible during certain seasons, and different Pokémon {{can be found in the}} wild in winter where others are encountered in the other seasons. The Pokémon Deerling and Sawsbuck change their physical appearance to match the seasons.|$|E

50|$|The {{variety of}} {{implementations}} for image-based gesture recognition may also cause issue for {{viability of the}} technology to general usage.

Furthermore, the distance from <b>the</b> <b>camera,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera's</b> resolution <b>and</b> quality, also cause variations in recognition accuracy.|$|R
25|$|Reviews {{typically}} {{praised the}} game for avoiding its predecessor's mistakes and for its storyline, customization options, gameplay and combat engine.

25|$|In 1981, Sony {{unveiled}} the first consumer camera {{to use a}} charge-coupled device for imaging, {{eliminating the need for}} film: the Sony Mavica. While the Mavica saved images to disk, the images were displayed on television, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> was not fully digital.

25|$|No images {{provide a}} {{vertical}} view; in fact, the smallest angle between the planetary surface normal <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> axis is about 50°. The high obliquity of the images, {{the wide range}} in sun-elevation angles, and the complete transection of the quadrangle by the gap in coverage greatly hamper geologic mapping. Only in about 15 percent of the quadrangle, near the southeast corner, do data permit separation of units with the confidence possible in other quadrangles on Mercury.|$|E
