40|$|The {{infectious}} yeast Candida albicans progresses {{through two}} developmental programs which involve differential gene expression, the bud-hypha transition and high-frequency phenotypic switching. To understand how differentially expressed genes are regulated in this organism, the promoters of phase-specific genes must be functionally characterized, and <b>a</b> <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>reporter</b> system would facilitate such characterization. However, C. albicans {{has adopted a}} nontraditional codon strategy that involves a tRNA with a CAG anticodon to decode the codon CUG as serine rather than leucine. Since the luciferase gene of the sea pansy Renilla reinformis contains no CUGs, we have used it to develop a highly sensitive bioluminescent reporter system for C. albicans. When fused to the galactose-inducible promoter of GAL 1, luciferase activity is inducible; when fused to the constitutive EF 1 alpha 2 promoter, luciferase activity is constitutive; and when fused to the promoter of the white-phase-specific gene WH 11 or the opaque-phase-specific gene OP 4, luciferase activity is phase specific. The Renilla luciferase system can, therefore, be used as <b>a</b> <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>reporter</b> to analyze the strength and developmental regulation of C. albicans promoters...|$|E
40|$|The {{unicellular}} green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii {{has emerged}} as a superb model species in plant biology. Although the alga is easily transformable, the low efficiency of transgene expression from the Chlamydomonas nuclear genome has severely hampered functional genomics research. For example, poor transgene expression is held responsible for the lack of sensitive reporter genes to monitor gene expression in vivo, analyze subcellular protein localization or study protein-protein interactions. Here, we have tested the luciferase from the marine copepod Gaussia princeps (G-Luc) for its suitability as <b>a</b> sensitive <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>reporter</b> of gene expression in Chlamydomonas. We show that a Gaussia luciferase gene variant, engineered to match the codon usage in the Chlamydomonas nuclear genome, serves as a highly sensitive reporter of gene expression from both constitutive and inducible algal promoters. Its bioluminescence signal intensity greatly surpasses previously developed reporters for Chlamydomonas nuclear gene expression and reaches values high enough for utilizing the reporter as a tool to monitor responses to environmental stresses in vivo and to conduct high-throughput screenings for signaling mutants in Chlamydomonas...|$|R
40|$|Luciferases {{have proven}} to be useful tools in {{advancing}} our understanding of biologic processes. Having <b>a</b> multitude of <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>reporters</b> with different properties is highly desirable. We characterized codon-optimized thermostable green- and red-emitting luciferase variants from the Italian firefly Luciola italica for mammalian gene expression in culture and in vivo. Using lentivirus vectors to deliver and stably express these luciferases in mammalian cells, we showed that both variants displayed similar levels of activity and protein half-lives as well as similar light emission kinetics and higher stability compared to the North American firefly luciferase. Further, we characterized the red-shifted variant for in vivo bioluminescence imaging. Intramuscular injection of tumor cells stably expressing this variant into nude mice yielded a robust luciferase activity. Light emission peaked at 10 minutes post-D-luciferin injection and retained > 60 % of signal at 1 hour. Similarly, luciferase activity from intracranially injected glioma cells expressing the red-shifted variant was readily detected and used as a marker to monitor tumor growth over time. Overall, our characterization of these codon-optimized luciferases lays the groundwork for their further use as <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>reporters</b> in mammalian cells...|$|R
40|$|Article first {{published}} online: 18 JUN 2014 The plant circadian clock controls various physiological phenomena {{that are important}} for adaptation to natural day-night cycles. Many components of the circadian clock {{have been identified in}} Arabidopsis thaliana, the model plant for molecular genetic studies. Recent studies revealed evolutionary conservation of clock components in green plants. Homologues of clock-related genes have been isolated from Lemna gibba and Lemna aequinoctialis, and it has been demonstrated that these homologues function in the clock system {{in a manner similar to}} their functioning in Arabidopsis. While clock components are widely conserved, circadian phenomena display diversity even within the Lemna genus. In order to survey the full extent of diversity in circadian rhythms among duckweed plants, we characterised the circadian rhythms of duckweed by employing <b>a</b> semi-transient <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>reporter</b> system. Using <b>a</b> particle bombardment method, circadian <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>reporters</b> were introduced into nine strains representing five duckweed species: Spirodela polyrhiza, Landoltia punctata, Lemna gibba, L. aequinoctialis and Wolffia columbiana. We then monitored luciferase (luc+) reporter activities driven by AtCCA 1, ZmUBQ 1 or CaMV 35 S promoters under entrainment and free-running conditions. Under entrainment, AtCCA 1 ::luc+ showed similar diurnal rhythms in all strains. This suggests that the mechanism of biological timing under day-night cycles is conserved throughout the evolution of duckweeds. Under free-running conditions, we observed circadian rhythms of AtCCA 1 ::luc+, ZmUBQ 1 ::luc+ and CaMV 35 S::luc+. These circadian rhythms showed diversity in period length and sustainability, suggesting that circadian clock mechanisms are somewhat diversified among duckweeds...|$|R

In the present work, we developed NanoLuc as <b>a</b> sensitive <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>reporter</b> to measure quantitatively the internalization of cell membrane receptors, {{based on the}} pH dependence of the reporter activity. The G protein-coupled receptor RXFP 3, the cognate receptor of relaxin- 3 /INSL 7, {{was used as a}} model receptor. We first generated stable HEK 293 T cells that inducibly coexpressed a C-terminally NanoLuc-tagged human RXFP 3 and a C-terminally enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) -tagged human RXFP 3. The C-terminal EGFP-tag and NanoLuc-tag had no detrimental effects on the ligand-binding potency and intracellular trafficking of RXFP 3. Based on the fluorescence of the tagged EGFP reporter, the ligand-induced RXFP 3 internalization was visualized directly under a fluorescence microscope. Based on the bioluminescence of the tagged NanoLuc reporter, the ligand-induced RXFP 3 internalization was measured quantitatively by <b>a</b> convenient <b>bioluminescent</b> assay. Coexpression of an EGFP-tagged inactive [E 141 R]RXFP 3 had no detrimental effect on the ligand-binding potency and ligand-induced internalization of the NanoLuc-tagged wild-type RXFP 3, suggesting that the mutant RXFP 3 and wild-type RXFP 3 worked independently.

40|$|We have {{developed}} <b>a</b> dual <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>reporter</b> system allowing noninvasive, concomitant imaging of T-cell trafficking, expansion, and activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) in vivo. NFAT activation {{plays an important}} role in T-cell activation and T-cell development. Therefore we used this system to determine spatial-temporal activation patterns of (1) proliferating T lymphocytes during graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and (2) T-cell precursors during T-cell development after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In the first days after HSCT, donor T cells migrated to the peripheral lymph nodes and the intestines, whereas the NFAT activation was dominant in the intestines, suggesting an important role for the intestines in the early stages of alloactivation during development of GVHD. After adoptive transfer of in vitro-derived T-cell receptor (TCR) H-Y transgenic T-cell precursors into B 6 (H- 2 b) hosts of both sexes, NFAT signaling and development into CD 4 + or CD 8 + single-positive cells could only be detected in the thymus of female recipients indicating either absence of positive selection or prompt depletion of double-positive thymocytes in the male recipients.

We present results to show that localised domains of elevated calcium were observed exclusively in the anterior dorsal part of the ectoderm, and that these transients increased in number and amplitude between stages 9 to 11, just prior to the onset of neural induction. During this time, however, no increase in cytosolic fret? calcium was observed in the ventral ectoderm, mesoderm or endoderm, The origin and role of these dorsal calcium-signalling patterns were also investigated. Calcium transients require the presence of functional L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Inhibition of channel activation from stages 8 to 14 with the specific antagonist R(+) BayK 8644 led to a complete inhibition of the calcium transients during gastrulation and resulted in severe defects in the subsequent formation of the anterior nervous system. BayK treatment also led to a reduction in the expression of Zic 3 and geminin in whole embryos, and of NCAM in noggin-treated animal caps. The possible role of calcium transients in regulating developmental gene expression is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Many human {{diseases}} {{are characterized by}} the development of tissue hypoxia. Inadequate oxygenation can cause cellular dysfunction and death. Tissues use many strategies, including induction of angiogenesis and alterations in metabolism, to survive under hypoxic conditions. The heterodimeric transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a master regulator of genes that promote adaptation to hypoxia. HIF activity is linked to oxygen availability because members of the EGLN family hydroxylate HIFα subunits on specific prolyl residues when oxygen is present, which marks them for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. We created a mouse that ubiquitously expresses <b>a</b> <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>reporter</b> consisting of firefly luciferase fused to a region of HIF that is sufficient for oxygen-dependent degradation.

PTC 124 (Ataluren; (3 -[5 -(2 -fluorophenyl) - 1, 2, 4 -oxadiazol- 3 -yl]benzoic acid) discovered in an FLuc-based assay targeting nonsense codon suppression, is an unusually potent FLuc-inhibitor. Paradoxically, PTC 124 and related analogs increase cellular FLuc activity levels by posttranslational stabilization. In this study, {{we show that}} FLuc inhibition and stabilization {{is the result of}} an inhibitory product formed during the FLuc-catalyzed reaction between its natural substrate, ATP, and PTC 124. A 2. 0  Å cocrystal structure revealed the inhibitor to be the acyl-AMP mixed-anhydride adduct PTC 124 -AMP, which was subsequently synthesized and shown to be a high-affinity multisubstrate adduct inhibitor (MAI; KD =  120  pM) of FLuc. Biochemical assays, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, and near-attack conformer modeling demonstrate that formation of this novel MAI is absolutely dependent upon the precise positioning and reactivity of a key meta-carboxylate of PTC 124 within the FLuc active site. We also demonstrate that the inhibitory activity of PTC 124 -AMP is relieved by free coenzyme A, a component present at high concentrations in luciferase detection reagents used for cell-based assays. This explains why PTC 124 can appear to increase, instead of inhibit, FLuc activity in cell-based reporter gene assays. To our knowledge, this is an unusual example in which the “off-target” effect of a small molecule is mediated by an MAI mechanism...|$|R

The in vivo approach of CASP 3 and GAP 43 colocalization imaging was further validated and quantified by immunofluorescence. Importantly, in 82 % of GAP 43 positive cells, colocalization with CASP 3 was present.

We describe a novel sensitive solid-phase contact assay for in situ toxicity testing of soil pollutants based on <b>a</b> recombinant <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>reporter</b> strain of Nitrosomonas europaea. A slurry of the reporter strain and soil sample was shaken for 1 h, after which bioluminescence was measured either directly (soil slurry protocol) or in the supernatant obtained after centrifugation (soil extract protocol). The assay was validated for both protocols by using linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) as a toxic and adsorptive model compound in the soil samples. Interestingly, LAS showed the same toxicity to the reporter strain with either soil incubation (both protocols) or pure culture, suggesting that adsorbed LAS pools contributed to the observed toxicity. The solid-phase contact assay that used the reporter strain of lux-marked N. europaea was slightly more sensitive for the detection of LAS toxicity in soil than activity-based assays targeting indigenous nitrifiers and much more sensitive than assays targeting indigenous heterotrophic microbes. We conclude that the new solid-phase contact assay, which is based on direct interaction of the test microorganisms with bioavailable pools of the toxicants in soil, provides a most sensitive and relevant method for evaluating the in situ toxicity and assessing the risks of soil contaminants...|$|R

The activity of the S 100 A 4 reporter was validated in hypoxic conditions in MCF- 7 and BT 549 cells, where it was shown that induction of S 100 A 4 -generated bioluminescence was associated with upregulation in S 100 A 4. In vivo it was shown that human mesenchymal stem cells promoted the tumour growth of MCF- 7 cells and/or induced EMT-related traits, including downregulation/loss of E-cadherin, upregulation of Vimentin and/or upregulation of S 100 A 4.

For example, cultured astrocytes display circa-dian rhythms in Period 1 and Period 2 expression. It is not known, however, how or which intercellular factors synchronize and sustain rhythmicity in astrocytes. Because astrocytes are highly sensitive to vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), a neuropeptide released by neurons and important for the coordination of daily cycling, the authors hypothesized that VIP entrains circadian rhythms in astrocytes. They used astrocyte cultures derived from knock-in mice containing <b>a</b> <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>reporter</b> of PERIOD 2 (PER 2) protein, to assess the effects of VIP on the rhythmic properties of astrocytes. VIP induced a dose-dependent increase in the peak-to-trough amplitude of the ensemble rhythms of PER 2 expression with maximal effects near 100 nM VIP and threshold values between 0. 1 and 1 nM. VIP also induced dose- and phase-dependent shifts in PER 2 rhythms and daily VIP administration entrained bioluminescence rhythms of astrocytes to a predicted phase angle. This is the first demonstration that a neu-ropeptide can entrain glial cells to a phase predicted by a phase-response curve.

Although proven effective for the in vitro determination of estrogenic and androgenic activity, the assays’ incubation time of 3 - 5 days is impractical when considering the 87, 000 chemicals requiring Tier I screening. To overcome this issue, bioluminescent versions of these reporters have been constructed. Gupta et al. (2003) functionally expressed the luxA, B, C, D, and E genes from Photorhabdus luminescens and the frp gene from Vibrio harveyi in S. cerevisiae. The present work extends this system by developing estrogen- and androgen-responsive yeast-based bioluminescent bioreporters and demonstrating its usefulness against known endocrine disrupting compounds. Research Goals The purpose of Tier 1 screening is to identify substances that {{have the potential to}} interact with the endocrine system (O’Conner et al., 2002). The colorimetric-based YES has been widely used in the literature and this laboratory and is a very useful tool for assessing estrogenicity of a compound or environmental sample. Development of the bioluminescent version of the YES system (S. cerevisiae BLYES) has the potential to enhance the utility of this system. The primary objective of this research is to (i) validate the BLYES system and develop a standard operating procedure for routine chemical analysis; and (ii) develop <b>an</b> androgen <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>reporter</b> system analogous to the BLYES system.

40|$|Recent {{reports have}} shown that several strains of Pseudomonas putida produce N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs). These signal {{molecules}} enable bacteria to coordinately express certain phenotypic traits in a density-dependent manner in a process referred to as quorum sensing. In this study we have cloned a genomic region of the plant growth-promoting P. putida strain IsoF that, when present in trans, provoked induction of <b>a</b> <b>bioluminescent</b> AHL <b>reporter</b> plasmid. Sequence analysis identified a gene cluster consisting of four genes: ppuI and ppuR, whose predicted amino acid sequences are highly similar to proteins of the LuxI-LuxR family, an open reading frame (ORF) located in the intergenic region between ppuI and ppuR with significant homology to rsaL from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and a gene, designated ppuA, present upstream of ppuR, the deduced amino acid sequence of which shows similarity to long-chain fatty acid coenzyme A ligases from various organisms. Using a transcriptional ppuA::luxAB fusion we demonstrate that expression of ppuA is AHL dependent. Furthermore, transcription of the AHL synthase ppuI is shown {{to be subject to}} quorum-sensing regulation, creating a positive feedback loop. Sequencing of the DNA regions flanking the ppu gene cluster indicated that the four genes form an island in the suhB-PA 3819 intergenic region of the currently sequenced P. putida strain KT 2440. Moreover, we provide evidence that the ppu genes are not present in other AHL-producing P. putida strains, indicating that this gene cluster is so far unique for strain IsoF. While the wild-type strain formed very homogenous biofilms, both a ppuI and a ppuA mutant formed structured biofilms with characteristic microcolonies and water-filled channels. These results suggest that the quorum-sensing system influences biofilm structural development...|$|R
40|$|<b>Bioluminescent</b> <b>reporter</b> genes, such {{as those}} from fireflies and bacteria, let {{researchers}} use light production as a non-invasive and non-destructive surrogate measure of microbial numbers {{in a wide variety}} of environments. As bioluminescence needs microbial metabolites, tagging microorganisms with luciferases means only live metabolically active cells are detected. Despite the wide use of <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>reporter</b> genes, very little is known about the impact of continuous (also called constitutive) light expression on tagged bacteria. We have previously made <b>a</b> <b>bioluminescent</b> strain of Citrobacter rodentium, a bacterium which infects laboratory mice in a similar way to how enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) infect humans. In this study, we compared the growth of the bioluminescent C. rodentium strain ICC 180 with its non-bioluminescent parent (strain ICC 169) {{in a wide variety of}} environments. To understand more about the metabolic burden of expressing light, we also compared the growth profiles of the two strains under approximately 2, 000 different conditions. We found that constitutive light expression in ICC 180 was near-neutral in almost every non-toxic environment tested. However, we also found that the non-bioluminescent parent strain has a competitive advantage over ICC 180 during infection of adult mice, although this was not enough for ICC 180 to be completely outcompeted. In conclusion, our data suggest that constitutive light expression is not metabolically costly to C. rodentium and supports the view that bioluminescent versions of microbes can be used as a substitute for their non-bioluminescent parents to study bacterial behaviour in a wide variety of environments...|$|R
40|$|The firefly {{luciferase}} complementation assay {{is widely}} used as <b>a</b> <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>reporter</b> technology to detect protein-protein interactions in vitro, in cellulo, and in vivo. Upon the interaction of a protein pair, complemented firefly luciferase emits light through the adenylation and oxidation of its substrate, luciferin. Although {{it has been suggested}} that kinetics of light production in the firefly luciferase complementation assay is different from that in full length luciferase, the mechanism behind this is still not understood. To quantitatively understand the different kinetics and how changes in affinity of a protein pair affect the light emission in the assay, a mathematical model of the in vitro firefly luciferase complementation assay was constructed. Analysis of the model finds that the change in kinetics is caused by rapid dissociation of the protein pair, low adenylation rate of luciferin, and increased affinity of adenylated luciferin to the enzyme. The model suggests that the affinity of the protein pair has an exponential relationship with the light detected in the assay. This relationship causes the change of affinity in a protein pair to be underestimated. This study underlines the importance of understanding the molecular mechanism of the firefly luciferase complementation assay in order to analyze protein pair affinities quantitatively...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNew monohalogenated maleimide {{derivatives}} (with bromine, chlorine or iodine) were synthesized to {{test the}} effect of halogen atoms in inhibiting the formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm. The evaluation of their biological activities clearly defines a structure-activity relationship. In this study, the bactericidal action of the three compounds was observed at the concentration range 0. 3 - 5. 0 mM on Luria-Bertani agar plates. The halogen atom of these molecules was critical in modulating the antibacterial activity, with a slightly higher effectiveness for chlorine. Confocal laser scanning microscopy {{was used to examine}} P. aeruginosa biofilms cultivated in flow cells. At concentration as low as 40 microM, the bromine and iodine compounds displayed a total inhibition towards the formation of bacterial biofilm. At this concentration, the bacterial attachment to glass surfaces was strongly affected by the presence of bromine and iodine whereas the chlorine derivative behaved as a bactericidal compound. <b>A</b> <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>reporter</b> strain was then used to detect the effect of the chemically synthesized maleimides on quorum sensing (QS) in P. aeruginosa. At the concentration range 10 - 100 microM, bioluminescence assays reveal that halogenated maleimides were able to interfere with the QS of the bacterium. Although the relationship between the weak inhibition of cell-to-cell communication (15 - 55 % of the signal) and the high inhibition of biofilm formation has not been elucidated clearly, the results demonstrate that bromo- and iodo-N-substituted maleimides bromine and iodine may be used as new potent inhibitors that control bacterial biofilms...|$|E
40|$|Background: Clinical {{and genetic}} studies suggest {{circadian}} clock genes {{may contribute to}} biological mechanisms underlying alcohol use disorders (AUD). In particular, the Per 2 gene regulates alcohol consumption in mutant animals, and in humans with AUD, the 10870 variant in PER 2 {{has been associated with}} alcohol consumption. However, with respect to function, the molecular clock remains largely uncharacterized in AUD patients. Methods: In skin fibroblast cultures from well-characterized human AUD patients (n = 19) and controls (n = 13), we used <b>a</b> <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>reporter</b> gene (Per 2 ::luc) to measure circadian rhythms in gene expression at high sampling density for 5 days. Cells were genotyped for the PER 2 10870 variant. The rhythm parameters period and amplitude were then analyzed using a case-control design and by genetic and clinical characteristics of the AUD subjects. Results: There were no differences between AUD cases and controls in rhythm parameters. However, period was inversely correlated with illness severity (defined as the number of alcohol dependence criteria met). The PER 2 variant 10870 was not associated with differences in rhythm parameters. Conclusions: Our data suggest that differences in the cellular circadian clock are not pronounced in fibroblasts from AUD cases and controls. However, we found evidence that the circadian clock may be associated with an altered trajectory of AUD, possibly related to illness severity. Future work will be required to determine the mechanistic basis of this association. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism...|$|E
40|$|Proteins {{have to be}} folded {{to their}} native {{structures}} to be functionally expressed. Misfolded proteins are proteotoxic and negatively impact on cellular fitness. To maintain the proteome functional proteins are under the constant surveillance of dedicated molecular chaperones that perform protein quality control (PQC). Using the model organism yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae this thesis investigates the molecular mechanisms that cells employ to maintain protein homeostasis (proteostasis). In Study I {{the role of the}} molecular chaperone Hsp 110 in the disentanglement and reactivation of aggregated proteins was investigated. We found that Hsp 110 is essential for cellular protein disaggregation driven by the molecular chaperones Hsp 40, Hsp 70 and Hsp 104 and characterized its involvement via regulation of Hsp 70 ATPase activity as a nucleotide exchange factor. In Study II we found out that Hsp 110 undergoes translational frameshifting during its expression resulting in a nuclear targeting. Nuclear Hsp 110 interacts with Hsp 70 and reprograms the proteostasis system to better deal with stress and to confer longevity. Study III describes regulation of Hsp 70 function in PQC by the nucleotide exchange factor Fes 1. We found that rare alternative splicing regulates Fes 1 subcellular localization in the cytosol and nucleus and that the cytosolic isoform has a key role in PQC. In Study IV we have revealed the molecular mechanism that Fes 1 employ in PQC. We show that Fes 1 carries a specialized release domain (RD) that ensures the efficient release of protein substrates from Hsp 70, explaining how Fes 1 maintains the Hsp 70 -chaperone system clear of persistent misfolded proteins. In Study V we report on the use of <b>a</b> novel <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>reporter</b> (Nanoluc) for use in yeast to measure the gene expression and protein levels. In summary, this thesis contributes to the molecular understanding of chaperone-dependent PQC mechanisms both at the level of individual components as well as how they interact to ensure proteostasis.

40|$|Tumor hypoxia {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} parameters that determines treatment sensitivity and is mainly due to insufficient tumor angiogenesis. However, the local oxygen concentration in a tumor can also be shifted in response to different treatment modalities such as cytotoxic agents or ionizing radiation. Thus, combined treatment modalities including microtubule stabilizing agents could create an additional challenge for an effective treatment response due to treatment-induced shifts in tumor oxygenation. Tumor hypoxia was probed over a prolonged observation period in response to treatment with different cytotoxic agents, using <b>a</b> non-invasive <b>bioluminescent</b> ODD-Luc <b>reporter</b> system, in which part of the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain of HIF- 1 a is fused to luciferase. As demonstrated in vitro, this system not only detects hypoxia at an ambient oxygen concentration of 1 % O 2, but also discriminates low oxygen concentrations in the range from 0. 2 to 1 % O 2. Treatment of A 549 lung adenocarcinoma-derived tumor xenografts with the microtubule stabilizing agent patupilone resulted in a prolonged increase in tumor hypoxia, which could be used as marker for its antitumoral treatment response, while irradiation did not induce detectable changes in tumor hypoxia. Furthermore, despite patupilone-induced hypoxia, the potency of ionizing radiation (IR) was not reduced as part of a concomitant o...|$|R
