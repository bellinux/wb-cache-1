500|$|Jackson {{confided in}} Branca {{that he wanted}} to be the biggest star in show {{business}} and [...] "the wealthiest". Jackson was upset about what he perceived to be the under-performance of Off the Wall, stating, [...] "It was totally unfair that it didn't get Record of the Year and it can never happen again." [...] He also felt undervalued by the music industry; in 1980 when Jackson asked the publicist of Rolling Stone if they would be interested in doing a cover story on him, the publicist declined, to which Jackson responded, [...] "I've been told over and over that black people on the cover of magazines doesn't sell copies ... Just wait. Someday those magazines are going to be begging me for an interview. Maybe I'll give them one, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> won't." ...|$|E
500|$|Daniels {{had said}} that he was {{attracted}} to the initial novel based on how [...] "raw and honest" [...] it felt. In an interview with AMC he noted that reading the book brought back a memory from his childhood of a young abused girl who knocked on his family's door, claiming that her mom was going to kill her. Daniels recalls that the incident {{was the first time he}} saw his mother frightened, specifically noting the helplessness of the situation, and stating [...] "she knew that she’d have to send this little girl home, and that was what disturbed her— that she couldn’t save her. She tried to make it easier for her. That’s all she could do." [...] In creating the movie Daniels hoped that the experience would be cathartic and that [...] "maybe I could heal. <b>And</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> could heal other people, too." [...] Another stated goal Daniels had was to challenge the general public's perception of incest.|$|E
500|$|A big storyline {{occurred}} {{for the character}} in 2008, when Phoebe is killed after the car her boyfriend Rick Forrester (Kyle Lowder) was driving crashes. Her death left Steffy [...] "despondent and nearly suicidal". Wood recalled filming the storyline as being tough: [...] "Being a newbie, I was {{up most of the}} night trying to memorize all those monologues." [...] Speaking of emotional scenes where Steffy visited her sister's body in the morgue, the actress noted [...] "She was so tiny and innocent, and to see this beautiful young girl in the morgue, I had to keep my emotions in check. It was challenging. It was such a sad story." [...] Months later, Steffy becomes romantically involved with Rick, who was also previously in a relationship with her mother, Taylor. Reflecting on her initial reaction to the storyline, Wood revealed [...] "Sometimes when you read a script, you're like, 'How am I going [...] do this? How is Steffy going {{to fall in love with}} Rick after he had sex with her sister and their mom?'" [...] She also noted that [...] "I had to play that my fraternal twin is gone, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> am doing this to live her life as well as have fun. She had to fill that void, and she could not talk to anyone. She lost a part of herself. I have to stress that to the viewers." [...] Wood was [...] "completely shocked" [...] with the speed at which the couple were moving, and said that the romance happened through Phoebe's death because of Steffy's raw feelings. However, she still felt that Steffy was in love with Rick and wanted to give herself to him. Lowder said the couple came together at the [...] "height of their emotions when Phoebe died". While describing the romance as [...] "complete honesty and no games", Wood said Steffy felt if she was close to Rick she could be close to Phoebe.|$|E

2500|$|Manson has {{commented on}} the subject of children, saying that she [...] "just missed the whole baby calling. I feel a lot of women think you're a freak if you feel like that, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> am strange but I never got that feeling. In some ways I wish I had that urge, because I adore children... I feel I can live quite happily with my decision." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ogre {{has said}} that Skinny Puppy acted as an escape for Key, who wished to {{distance}} himself from Images in Vogue: [...] "He was looking for something to break out of , <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> was it". Key would continue to drum for Images in Vogue until the group relocated to Toronto in 1985. Key's concept behind Skinny Puppy came from the group's first song ever recorded, [...] "K-9". The idea, according to Key, was to create music which explored [...] "life as seen through a dog's eyes". Skinny Puppy also incorporated the use of [...] "B-grade horror movie visuals", including fake blood and props, into their live performances. Key justified these [...] "shock gore" [...] antics with the following: ...|$|E
2500|$|Gibson began {{production}} on his film without securing outside funding or distribution. In 2002, he explained why {{he could not}} get backing from the Hollywood studios: [...] "This is a film about something that nobody wants to touch, shot in two dead languages. In Los Angeles they think I am insane, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> am." [...] Gibson and his Icon Productions company provided the film's sole backing, spending about $30 million on production costs and an estimated $15 million on marketing. After early accusations of anti-Semitism, it became difficult for Gibson to find an American distribution company. 20th Century Fox had a first-look deal with Icon and passed on the film in response to public protests. In order to avoid the spectacle of other studios turning down the film and to avoid subjecting the distributor to the same intense public criticism he had received, Gibson decided to distribute the movie in the United States himself, with Newmarket Films.|$|E

It’s {{slightly}} preppy, but not casual… I do tend to gravitate towards things that are more classic and elegant, and not too haute couture. I think Kate Spade to me is very comparable to Tory Burch in that I {{think she has a}} lot of what I qualify as a classic look, and clean lines.|$|R
