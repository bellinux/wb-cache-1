Case Study on conventional commercial banks in Indonesia Stock Exchange in period 2009 - 2013. Research population used is conventional comercial banks in Indonesia in period 2009 - 2013. Taken samples of the <b>all-purpose</b> 24 <b>banks</b> by using purposive sampling method. The data {{used in this study}} were obtained from the Banking Annual Report 2009 - 2013. Analysis technique used is Ordinary Least Square Regression (OLS), statistical t-test and classic assumption test that includes a test of normality test, multicollinearity test, heteroskedastisitas test, autocorrelation test. The result shows that bank ownership has significant positive association with NPL, concentration ownership has insignificant negative association with NPL, and Loan to Deposit Ratio has insignificant positive association with NPL. Operating cost to operating income ratio, bank size, and Capital Adequacy Ratio have significant negative association with NPL.

Analysis technique used is multiple regression analysis with least squares equation, statistical t-test and performed a classic assumption test that includes a test of normality test, multicollinearity test, heteroskedastisitas test, autocorrelation test. Based on the test for normality test, multicollinearity test, heteroskedastisitas test, and autocorrelation test, not found the variables stray from the classical assumptions. This indicates that the available data has been qualified to use the model of multiple linier regression equation. Research results show that partially, Size funds is not significant and influential negatively to NPL, Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR) effect significantly positive direction to the NPL, Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) has no effect in a significant way and negative direction to the NPL, Operating Expenses to Operating Income effect significantly positive direction to the NPL, portfolio of short-term loan not significantly influential to the NPL and negative direction, portfolio of medium-term loan effect significantly positive direction to the NPL, portfolio of long-term loan not significantly influential to the NPL and negative direction, Loan interest rate has no effect in a significant way and positive direction to the NPL.
