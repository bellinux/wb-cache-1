5|$|Defeats in late March {{already had}} the Azeri {{military}} evacuating civilians out of the region to the northern town of Yevlakh and Azerbaijan's second largest city, Ganja. The Armenians had assembled a force of several hundred men to enter Kelbajar from four different directions: Melkonian's own detachment of tanks and troops from Karabakh would <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> southeast, one fifty-man unit {{from the town of}} Vardenis, Armenia would enter from the west; the third force would <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> village of Aghdaban in the north, and the primary attacking force would come from the village of Narınclar.|$|E
5|$|The {{extensive}} and complex arrangements required {{to support the}} infantry <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> west and the mounted <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> east were completed by 30 October, when these attacking forces moved to positions within a day's march of their deployment. Three divisions of XX Corps were concentrated in position: the 53rd (Welsh) Division at Goz el Geleib, the 60th (London) Division at Esani and the 74th (Yeomanry) Division at Khasif. In preparation for their final approach march, the Civil Service Rifles and the Queen's Westminster Rifles (179th Brigade, 60th Division) were supplied with tea and rum for the following day. In their haversack rations were five onions, a tin of bully beef, a slice of cooked bacon, biscuits and dates.|$|E
5|$|Al Jalali Fort lies on a {{rocky outcrop}} {{on the east}} side of the Muscat harbor. It faces Fort Al-Mirani, which is built on another outcrop on the west side. Muscat was {{strongly}} defended against <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sea by these twin forts, by the Muttrah fort further to the west and by other fortifications on the rocky ridges surrounding the bay.|$|E
5000|$|If <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rear, {{the ranks}} reverse order, so the rear rank now becomes <b>the</b> front. If <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> flank, the {{opposite}} flank {{now serves as}} the rear rank.|$|R
25|$|On 30 August, the Iraqi Army, Shi'ite {{militias and}} Peshmerga started a {{campaign}} to break the siege, after the speaker of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Abdul-Mahdi al-Karabalai, called to move and break the siege by ISIS on the town. <b>The</b> forces <b>attacked</b> ISIS <b>from</b> three areas, <b>the</b> army <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> south of Amirli in Adhaim, <b>the</b> Peshmerga <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north in Tuz Khormato, <b>the</b> militias <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> east in Kifri.|$|R

5|$|Brood War {{introduces}} seven new units. Each race {{is given}} access to a unique ground unit: the Zerg can create a defensive unit that can <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> concealment of its burrow, while the Terrans can train combat medics. The Protoss are able to produce dark templar units, a powerful cloaked melee unit only given to the player in special missions of StarCraft. Protoss players can merge two of these units to create a special spellcaster unit. Each race is also {{given access to}} a dedicated air-to-air attack unit.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} 36 {{hours of the}} Battle of Sharon; between 04:30 on 19 September and 17:00 on 20 September, the German and Ottoman front line had been cut by {{infantry}} and the cavalry had passed through the gap to reach their objectives at Afulah, Nazareth and Beisan. The continuing infantry <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> south forced the Ottoman Seventh and Eighth armies in the Judean Hills to withdraw northwards.|$|E
5|$|During {{the six-month}} fight against Italy, the Hellenic army made {{territorial}} gains by eliminating Italian salients. Greece {{did not have}} a substantial armaments industry and its equipment and ammunition supplies increasingly relied on stocks captured by British forces from defeated Italian armies in North Africa. To man the Albanian battlefront, the Greek command was forced to withdraw forces from Eastern Macedonia and Western Thrace, because Greek forces could not protect Greece's entire border. The Greek command decided to support its success in Albania, regardless of the risk of a German <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Bulgarian border.|$|E
5|$|Union {{infantry}} <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{east side}} of the battlefield, while most of <b>the</b> cavalry <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> south and west. Capehart's brigade <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> southwest, and eventually was on the extreme western side of the battlefield. At times, the cavalry fought dismounted, with their horses led at a safe distance behind. The opposing forces were always within range of the Union cavalry carbines, keeping the weapon's seven-shot advantage—and not enabling the Confederate infantry to utilize the advantage of their longer range weapons.|$|R

25|$|At 23:00, the Greek Cypriot {{mountain}} commando forces {{launched a}} coordinated night attack {{just north of}} the Agyrta-Nicosia enclave, attempting to secure and blockade the Agyrta-Nicosia pass through the Pentedaktylos mountains. The 31MK and 33MK Commando <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> west, while the 32MK and 34MK Commando <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> east.|$|R
5|$|Estimated {{numbers of}} Calusa at the {{beginning}} of the Spanish occupation ranged from 4,000 to 7,000. The society declined in power and population; by 1697 their number was estimated to be about 1,000. In the early 18th century, the Calusa came under <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Yamasee to the north. They asked the Spanish for refuge in Cuba, where almost 200 died of illness. Soon they were relocated again to the Florida Keys.|$|E
5|$|Ferdinand reluctantly ordered saps to be {{dug into}} the side of the mountain. The sapping was {{difficult}} and dangerous and the sappers worked under continuous <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> castle's defenders, who fired on them with small arms and the castle's artillery and dropped rocks and debris on their heads. The forced labor of local peasants minimized losses among Ferdinand's own troops, but many of the peasants perished in the effort.|$|E
5|$|Greece's mountainous terrain {{favored a}} {{defensive}} strategy {{and the high}} ranges of the Rhodope, Epirus, Pindus and Olympus mountains offered many defensive opportunities. However, air power was required to protect defending ground forces from entrapment in the many defiles. Although an invading force from Albania could be stopped by {{a relatively small number}} of troops positioned in the high Pindus mountains, the northeastern part of the country was difficult to defend against an <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north.|$|E
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 219 BC Sparta <b>attacked</b> Achaea <b>from</b> <b>the</b> South, Elis <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> west, and <b>the</b> Aetolians <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north. By {{the end of the}} summer, Achaea was near collapse. Philip V, meanwhile, was marching down the coast west of Aetolia, {{starting}} from Epirus and ending in Calydon, where he received news of a pending invasion of Macedon. He returned to his homeland, but the invasion never took place.|$|R

5000|$|In {{a chapter}} of the book Myth, Media, and Culture in Star Wars, Michael Kaminski, writing about the {{influence}} of Japanese director Akira Kurosawa on the Star Wars films, said that Kurosawa's Ran influenced the exchange of blaster fire. Like in Ran, color-coding and an [...] "onscreen sense of direction" [...] of blaster fire are used to depict opposing forces. In the Star Wars original trilogy, rebels employed red blaster fire and often <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> left, while the Empire employed green blaster fire and <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> right. In Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones, the second film of the prequel trilogy, the color and the direction were reversed. In that film, the Republic employed green and blue blaster fire and <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> right, while the villains employed red blaster fire and <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> left.|$|R
5|$|Having been forewarned {{about the}} attack, the Portuguese {{commander}} {{had been able}} to begin preparations for the assault; however, he had planned on receiving a frontal assault and when the force came under <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rear he was completely surprised. The Portuguese attempted to entrench themselves in rifle pits, but they became disoriented after Pinto and several other officers were slain early in the engagement.|$|E
5|$|Having {{isolated}} Damascus, Khalid {{ordered his}} army to surround {{the city on}} August 21, 634 (the 20th of Jamadi-ul-Akhir, 13 Hijri). The corps commanders were instructed to repel any Byzantine <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> respective gates, and seeking assistance {{in the case of}} heavy attack. Dharar bin al-Azwar commanded 2.000 horsemen from the mobile guard to patrol in the empty areas between the gates at night and to reinforce any corps attacked by the Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|His {{military}} ability {{was tested}} by an <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sabines. Tarquinius doubled {{the numbers of}} equites to help the war effort, and defeat the Sabines. In the peace negotiations that followed, Tarquinius received the town of Collatia and appointed his nephew, Arruns Tarquinius, also known as Egerius, as commander of the garrison which he stationed in that city. Tarquinius returned to Rome and celebrated a triumph for his victories that, according to the Fasti Triumphales, occurred on 13 September 585 BC.|$|E
5000|$|On 18 July, the Japanese {{were still}} unable {{to break through the}} Chinese {{southern}} defensive lines. Pressured with increasingly high casualties, General Yokoyama once again halted the offensive. On 4 August, Japanese Field Marshal Shunroku Hata (畑 俊六) ordered three divisions to reinforce the 68th and 116th Divisions, increasing the total manpower to 110,000 troops. <b>The</b> 40th Division <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> northwest, while <b>the</b> 58th <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north and <b>the</b> 13th <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> east. [...] After four days of intense bombing and artillery shelling, the Chinese garrison was reduced to 2,000 wounded men, less than a regiment (3,000).|$|R
50|$|As the {{likelihood}} of sea-based missile <b>attacks</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Mexico decreased, and the low probability of missile <b>attacks</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> South, the United States Air Force decided to close southern-facing PAVE PAWS sites at Robins AFB and Eldorado AS, Texas. Two radar faces, one each from Robins AFB and Eldorado AS, were moved to Clear AFS, Alaska {{as part of the}} BMEWS upgrade in 1998.|$|R

5|$|Napoleon withdrew {{back into}} France, his army reduced to 70,000 soldiers, and little cavalry; he faced {{more than three}} times as many Allied troops. The French were surrounded: British armies pressed from the south, and other Coalition forces {{positioned}} to <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> German states. Napoleon won a series of victories in the Six Days' Campaign, though these were not significant enough to turn the tide. The leaders of Paris surrendered to the Coalition in March 1814.|$|E
5|$|On 25 July 1805, Nicolls was {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} captain, and assigned command of a company which embarked in HMS Standard. During 1807 and 1808, Nicolls participated in the siege of Corfu and in a foray to Egypt. It was during this period, too, that he was honourably mentioned in dispatches for his part in the Dardanelles Operation, during which he captured a Turkish flag. In 1808 he led the boat <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Standard which captured the Italian gunboat Volpe off Corfu.|$|E
5|$|Overlooking Old Grimsby harbour and the {{anchorage}} of St Helen's Pool, the blockhouse {{would have}} housed {{a battery of}} two or three artillery pieces, positioned on a square gun platform on top of a rocky outcrop. An earthwork bank and a stone wall were built to protect it from <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> beach and the landward sides respectively. A small room to provide living quarters for the garrison was later constructed {{on the side of the}} gun platform.|$|E
50|$|When <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> side, {{both males}} and females will attempt to bite the {{attacker}} and males will stridulate (females have no functional stridulatory mechanism). In about half <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> side, either gender may autohaemorrhage, squirting between 5 mg and 80 mg of possibly toxic haemolymph at the attacker at ranges of up to 3 cm.|$|R
50|$|Before dawn on 16 May, Hopton divided {{his army}} into four columns of 600 men and two cannons, keeping his horse in reserve. Hoping to {{surprise}} Stamford's army, these four columns advanced from four different directions around 5:00 a.m. Hopton led <b>the</b> first column <b>from</b> <b>the</b> south, while Major-General Basset <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north and Sir Bevil Grenville and Sir Nicholas Slanning <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> west.|$|R

5|$|R. Parthiepan as Chola King, {{successor}} {{and last}} of the Chola dynasty after escaping an <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Pandyas. The city that the Cholas lived in perished, resulting in the city becoming haunted with Parthiepan, {{the head of the}} people. The images for the Chola King, not dated or named in the film, were kept under wraps prior to the movie's release. Parthiepan signed for the role after much speculation that Dhanush would be selected, and his performance won plaudits from critics.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneously {{with the}} Hungarian <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north, the Byzantines invaded Bulgaria from the south. Tzar Simeon sent envoys to the Byzantine Empire {{to propose a}} truce. At the same time, he sent an embassy to the Pechenegs to incite them against the Hungarians. He succeeded and the Pechenegs broke into Hungarian territories from the east, forcing the Hungarian warriors to {{withdraw}} from Bulgaria. The Bulgarians, according to Constantine Porphyrogenitus, attacked and routed the Hungarians.|$|E
5|$|The Lycaenidae have a {{false head}} {{consisting}} of eyespots and small tails (false antennae) to deflect <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> more vital head region. These may also cause ambush predators such as spiders to approach {{from the wrong}} end, enabling the butterflies to detect attacks promptly. Many butterflies have eyespots on the wings; these too may deflect attacks, or may serve to attract mates.|$|E
