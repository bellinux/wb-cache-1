40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to empirically {{investigate}} the effects of institutional support on product <b>and</b> <b>process</b> innovation <b>and</b> firm performance and describe how dysfunctional competition influences relevant outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: This study develops a research model based on institution-based view and tests it using structural equation modeling and empirical data collected from 300 manufacturers in China. Findings: The results show that institutional support positively affects product <b>and</b> <b>process</b> innovation <b>and</b> firm performance. Both product <b>and</b> <b>process</b> innovation improve firm performance. The findings reveal that dysfunctional competition significantly reduces the positive effects of institutional support on product <b>and</b> <b>process</b> innovation but leaves the effects of institutional support <b>and</b> product <b>and</b> <b>process</b> innovation on firm performance unaffected. Originality/value: This study contributes to innovation literature by providing insights into the impact of China’s institutional environment on manufacturing firms’ product <b>and</b> <b>process</b> innovation decisions. The findings also contribute to institution-based view literature by providing empirical evidence on the joint effects of institutional support and dysfunctional competition on product <b>and</b> <b>process</b> innovation <b>and</b> firm performance. This study can help manufacturers in China take advantage of institutional environment and adjust product <b>and</b> <b>process</b> innovation decisions accordingly...|$|R

5|$|A B cell {{identifies}} pathogens when antibodies on {{its surface}} bind to a specific foreign antigen. This antigen/antibody complex is {{taken up by the}} B cell <b>and</b> <b>processed</b> by proteolysis into peptides. The B cell then displays these antigenic peptides {{on its surface}} MHC class II molecules. This combination of MHC and antigen attracts a matching helper T cell, which releases lymphokines and activates the B cell. As the activated B cell then begins to divide, its offspring (plasma cells) secrete millions of copies of the antibody that recognizes this antigen. These antibodies circulate in blood plasma and lymph, bind to pathogens expressing the antigen and mark them for destruction by complement activation or for uptake and destruction by phagocytes. Antibodies can also neutralize challenges directly, by binding to bacterial toxins or by interfering with the receptors that viruses and bacteria use to infect cells.|$|E

5|$|Now {{recognised}} as {{a member}} of the family Spinosauridae, Baryonyx affinities were obscure when it was discovered. Apart from the type species (B. walkeri), some researchers have suggested that Suchomimus tenerensis belongs in the same genus and that Suchosaurus cultridens is a senior synonym; subsequent authors have kept them separate. Baryonyx was the first theropod dinosaur demonstrated to have been piscivorous (fish-eating), as evidenced by fish scales in the stomach region of the holotype specimen. It may also have been an active predator of larger prey and a scavenger, since it also contained bones of a juvenile Iguanodon. The creature would have caught <b>and</b> <b>processed</b> its prey primarily with its forelimbs and large claws. Baryonyx lived near water bodies, in areas where other theropod, ornithopod, and sauropod dinosaurs have also been found.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the lengthy building times of these ships, other countries were able to build dreadnoughts that were superior in protection and armament, {{with the exception of}} the French. Construction was delayed by late deliveries of the 305-millimeter guns and armor plates as well as shortages of labor.

5|$|The {{first people}} in the San Juan Basin were hunter-gatherers: the Archaic–Early Basketmaker people. These small bands descended from nomadic Clovis big-game hunters who arrived in the Southwest around 10,000 BC. More than 70 campsites from this period, carbon-dated to the period 7000–1500 BC and mostly {{consisting}} of stone chips and other leavings, were found in Atlatl Cave and elsewhere within Chaco Canyon, {{with at least one}} of the sites located on the canyon floor near an exposed arroyo. The Archaic–Early Basketmaker people were nomadic or semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who over time began making baskets to store gathered plants. By the end of the period, some people cultivated food. Excavation of their campsites and rock shelters has revealed that they made tools, gathered wild plants, and killed <b>and</b> <b>processed</b> game. Slab-lined storage cists indicate a change from a wholly nomadic lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|The pallium is a {{layer of}} gray matter that lies {{on the surface of}} the {{forebrain}} and is the most complex and most recent evolutionary development of the brain as an organ. In reptiles and mammals, it is called the cerebral cortex. Multiple functions involve the pallium, including smell and spatial memory. In mammals, where it becomes so large as to dominate the brain, it takes over functions from many other brain areas. In many mammals, the cerebral cortex consists of folded bulges called gyri that create deep furrows or fissures called sulci. The folds increase the surface area of the cortex and therefore increase the amount of gray matter and the amount of information that can be stored <b>and</b> <b>processed.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{computer}} program such as KetoCalculator {{may be used}} to help generate recipes. The meals often have four components: heavy whipping cream, a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas and corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, <b>and</b> <b>processed</b> foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic scale accurate to 1g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan.

5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{a disastrous}} factor for domestic psychiatry {{is that those}} who had committed the crime against humanity were allowed to stay on their positions until they can leave this world in a natural way. Those who retained their positions and influence turned domestic psychiatry from politically motivated one to criminally motivated one because the sphere of interests of this public {{has been reduced to}} making a business of psychopharmacologic drugs and taking possession of the homes of the ill. In Soviet times, all the heads of departments of psychiatry, all the directors of psychiatric research institutes, all the head doctors of psychiatric hospitals were the CPSU nomenklatura, which they remained so far. The representative of nomenklatura in psychiatry had the scheme of career that is simple and often stereotyped: for one to two years, he run errands as a resident, then joined the party and became a partgrouporg. His junior colleagues (usually non-partisan ones) collected <b>and</b> <b>processed</b> material for his dissertation. Its review of literature, particularly in a research institute for psychiatry, was often written by patients, because only they knew foreign languages, and their party comrades were not up to it, the natural habitat did not stimulate learning a foreign language.|$|E
5|$|To {{create the}} {{character}} animations for the game, actors {{were placed in}} front of a gray background and performed the motions, which were recorded on videotape (using a broadcast-quality, $20,000 Sony camera instead of the standard Hi8 camera used for the original Mortal Kombat). The video capture footage was then processed into a computer, and the background was removed from selected frames to create sprites. Towards the end of the game's development, they opted to instead use a blue screen technique <b>and</b> <b>processed</b> the footage directly into the computer for a similar, simpler process. The actors were lightly sprayed with water to give them a sweaty, glistening appearance, while post-editing was done on the sprites afterward to highlight flesh tones and improve the visibility of muscles, which Tobias felt set the series apart from similar games using digitized graphics. Animations of Shang Tsung morphing into other characters were created by Midway's John Vogel using a computer, while hand-drawn animations were used for other parts of the game, such as the Fatalities. For animating Goro and Kintaro, clay sculptures were created by Tobias' friend Curt Chiarelli and then turned into 12-inch latex miniatures that were used for stop motion filming. Because of technical restrictions, the actors' costumes had to be simple and no acrobatic moves such as backflips could have been recorded; the hardest moves to perform were some of the jumping kicks.|$|E
