25|$|Auxin induces shoot apical dominance; the {{axillary}} buds are inhibited by auxin, as a {{high concentration}} of auxin directly stimulates ethylene synthesis in axillary buds, causing inhibition of their growth and potentiation of <b>apical</b> <b>dominance.</b> When the apex of the plant is removed, the inhibitory effect is removed and the growth of lateral buds is enhanced. Auxin is sent to the part of the plant facing away from the light, where it promotes cell elongation, thus causing the plant to bend towards the light.|$|E
25|$|Cytokinins or CKs are a {{group of}} {{chemicals}} that influence cell division and shoot formation. They were called kinins {{in the past when}} the first cytokinins were isolated from yeast cells. They also help delay senescence of tissues, are responsible for mediating auxin transport throughout the plant, and affect internodal length and leaf growth. Cytokinins and auxins often work together, and the ratios of these two groups of plant hormones affect most major growth periods during a plant's lifetime. Cytokinins counter the <b>apical</b> <b>dominance</b> induced by auxins; they in conjunction with ethylene promote abscission of leaves, flower parts, and fruits.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{principle of}} plant organization based upon auxin distribution is <b>apical</b> <b>dominance,</b> {{which means the}} auxin produced by the apical bud (or growing tip) diffuses (and is transported) downwards and inhibits the development of ulterior lateral bud growth, which would otherwise compete with the apical tip for light and nutrients. Removing the apical tip and its suppressively acting auxin allows the lower dormant lateral buds to develop, and the buds between the leaf stalk and stem produce new shoots which compete to become the lead growth. The process is actually quite complex, because auxin transported downwards from the lead shoot tip has to interact with several other plant hormones (such as strigolactones or cytokinins) in the process on various positions along the growth axis in plant body to achieve this phenomenon. This plant behavior is used in pruning by horticulturists.|$|E
2500|$|The tuber has all {{the parts}} of a normal stem, {{including}} nodes and internodes. [...] The nodes are the eyes and each has a leaf scar. [...] The nodes or eyes are arranged around the tuber in a spiral fashion beginning on the end opposite the attachment point to the stolon. The terminal bud is produced at the farthest point away from the stolon attachment and tubers thus show the same <b>apical</b> <b>dominance</b> as a normal stem. [...] Internally, a tuber is filled with starch stored in enlarged parenchyma like cells. The inside of a tuber has the typical cell structures of any stem, including a pith, vascular zones, and a cortex.|$|E
2500|$|All living {{conifers}} are woody plants, {{and most}} are trees, the majority having monopodial growth form (a single, straight trunk with side branches) with strong <b>apical</b> <b>dominance.</b> Many conifers have distinctly scented resin, secreted to protect the tree against insect infestation and fungal infection of wounds. Fossilized resin hardens into amber. The size of mature conifers varies from less than one meter, to over 100 meters. The world's tallest, thickest, largest, and oldest living trees are all conifers. The tallest is a Coast Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), with a height of 115.55 meters (although one Victorian mountain ash, Eucalyptus regnans, allegedly grew to a height of 140 meters, although the exact dimensions were not confirmed). [...] The thickest, or tree with the greatest trunk diameter, is a Montezuma Cypress (Taxodium mucronatum), 11.42 meters in diameter. [...] The largest tree by three-dimensional volume is a Giant Sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum), with a volume 1486.9 cubic meters. The smallest is the pygmy pine (Lepidothamnus laxifolius) of New Zealand, which is seldom taller than 30cm when mature. The oldest is a Great Basin Bristlecone Pine (Pinus longaeva), 4,700 years old.|$|E
2500|$|Auxins are {{compounds}} that positively influence cell enlargement, bud formation and root initiation. They also promote {{the production of}} other hormones and in conjunction with cytokinins, they control the growth of stems, roots, and fruits, and convert stems into flowers. [...] Auxins were the first class of growth regulators discovered. They affect cell elongation by altering cell wall plasticity. They stimulate cambium, a subtype of meristem cells, to divide and in stems cause secondary xylem to differentiate. Auxins act to inhibit the growth of buds lower down the stems (<b>apical</b> <b>dominance),</b> and also to promote lateral and adventitious root development and growth. [...] Leaf abscission is initiated by the growing point of a plant ceasing to produce auxins. [...] Auxins in seeds regulate specific protein synthesis, as they develop within the flower after pollination, causing the flower to develop a fruit to contain the developing seeds. Auxins are toxic to plants in large concentrations; they are most toxic to dicots and less so to monocots. Because of this property, synthetic auxin herbicides including 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T have been developed and used for weed control. Auxins, especially 1-Naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), are also commonly applied to stimulate root growth when taking cuttings of plants. [...] The most common auxin found in plants is indole-3-acetic acid or IAA. The correlation of auxins and cytokinins in the plants is a constant (A/C = const.).|$|E
50|$|Axillary buds do {{not become}} {{actively}} growing shoots on plants with strong <b>apical</b> <b>dominance</b> (the tendency to grow just the terminal bud on the main stem). <b>Apical</b> <b>dominance</b> occurs because the shoot apical meristem produces auxin which prevents axillary buds from growing. The axillary buds begin developing when {{they are exposed to}} less auxin, for example if the plant naturally has weak <b>apical</b> <b>dominance,</b> if <b>apical</b> <b>dominance</b> is broken by removing the terminal bud, or if the terminal bud has grown far enough away for the auxin to have less of an effect.|$|E
5000|$|Occasionally, strong <b>apical</b> <b>dominance</b> is advantageous, {{as in the}} [...] "Ballerina" [...] apple trees. These {{trees are}} {{intended}} to be grown in small gardens, and their strong <b>apical</b> <b>dominance</b> combined with a dwarfing rootstock gives a compact narrow tree with very short fruiting side branches.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Apical</b> <b>{{dominance}},</b> {{dominance of}} the main central stem of a plant ...|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} of <b>apical</b> <b>dominance</b> {{is based on}} the plant hormone auxin. It is produced in the apical meristem and transported towards the roots in the cambium. If <b>apical</b> <b>dominance</b> is complete, it prevents any branches from forming as long as the apical meristem is active. If the dominance is incomplete, side branches will develop.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{fruit trees}} have strong <b>apical</b> <b>dominance,</b> and young trees can become [...] "leggy", with poor side limb development. <b>Apical</b> <b>dominance</b> {{can be reduced}} in this case, or in cases where limbs are broken off by accident, by cutting off the auxin flow above side buds that one wishes to stimulate. This is often done by orchardists for young trees.|$|E
50|$|Plant {{physiology}} describes <b>apical</b> <b>dominance</b> as {{the control}} exerted by the terminal bud (and shoot apex) over the outgrowth of lateral buds.|$|E
50|$|<b>Apical</b> <b>dominance</b> {{occurs when}} the shoot apex {{inhibits}} the growth of lateral buds so that the plant may grow vertically. It {{is important for the}} plant to devote energy to growing upward so that it can get more light to undergo photosynthesis. If the plant utilizes available energy for growing upward, it may be able to outcompete other individuals in the near vicinity. Plants that were capable of outcompeting neighboring plants likely had higher fitness. <b>Apical</b> <b>dominance</b> is therefore most likely adaptive.|$|E
5000|$|Pinching (also called [...] "FIMing") {{is similar}} to topping in that it causes lower {{branches}} to grow more rapidly, but the apical meristem maintain <b>apical</b> <b>dominance,</b> which is especially useful if the plant has already been topped. Pinching is performed by firmly pinching the apical meristem(s) so as to substantially damage vascular and structural cells but without totally breaking the stem. This causes lower limbs to grow more rapidly while the pinched tissue heals, after which time the stem resumes <b>apical</b> <b>dominance.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Apical</b> <b>dominance</b> is the {{phenomenon}} whereby the main, central stem {{of the plant}} is dominant over (i.e., grows more strongly than) other side stems; on a branch the main stem of the branch is further dominant over its own side branchlets.|$|E
50|$|As the apical {{meristem}} grows and forms leaves, it leaves behind {{a region of}} meristematic cells at the node between the stem and the leaf. These axillary buds are usually dormant, inhibited by auxin produced by the {{apical meristem}}, which is known as <b>apical</b> <b>dominance.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Many {{conifers}} show {{particularly strong}} <b>apical</b> <b>dominance,</b> strongest of all {{being in the}} family Araucariaceae, showing a single erect central trunk with strongly differentiated horizontal branching. Cuttings of Araucariaceae species taken from a side branch will not develop erect growth. Araucaria heterophylla, New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|Topping is {{the removal}} of the top of the apical {{meristem}} (dominant central stem), called the apex or terminal bud, to transfer <b>apical</b> <b>dominance</b> (the tendency for the apex to grow more rapidly {{than the rest of the}} plant) to the shoots emanating from the two nodes immediately beneath the pruning cut. This process can be repeated on one or both of the two new meristems, when they become apically dominant, with the same results. This process can actually be repeated nigh infinitely, but over-diffusion of <b>apical</b> <b>dominance</b> produces smaller, lower quality buds, so it is usually done no more than a few times. Topping also causes more rapid growth of all of the branches below the cut while the plant heals.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{investigations}} into <b>apical</b> <b>dominance</b> {{and the control}} of branching have revealed a new plant hormone family termed strigolactones. These compounds were previously known {{to be involved in}} seed germination and communication with mycorrhizal fungi and are now shown to be involved in inhibition of branching.|$|E
50|$|Phyllody can be artificially {{induced by}} {{applying}} cytokinins (CK), plant hormones responsible for cell division, {{as well as}} <b>apical</b> <b>dominance</b> and axillary bud growth. Conversely, it can be subsequently suppressed with the application of gibberellins (GA), plant hormones responsible for stem elongation, flowering, and sex expression.|$|E
50|$|Shade {{avoidance}} {{is a set}} {{of responses}} that plants display when they are subjected to the shade of another plant. It often includes elongation, altered flowering time, increased <b>apical</b> <b>dominance</b> and altered partitioning of resources. This set of responses is collectively called the shade-avoidance syndrome (SAS).|$|E
50|$|Cytokinins (CK) are a {{class of}} plant growth {{substances}} (phytohormones) that promote cell division, or cytokinesis, in plant roots and shoots. They are involved primarily in cell growth and differentiation, but also affect <b>apical</b> <b>dominance,</b> axillary bud growth, and leaf senescence. Folke Skoog discovered their effects using coconut milk in the 1940s at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.|$|E
50|$|Phytoplasmas are {{associated}} with plant diseases and are known to cause more than 600 diseases in several hundred plant species, including gramineous weeds and cereals. The symptoms shown by infected plants include: whitening or yellowing of the leaves, shortening of the internodes (leading to stunted growth), smaller leaves and excessive proliferation of shoots, resulting in a broom phenotype and loss of <b>apical</b> <b>dominance.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Many phytoplasma-infected plants {{develop a}} bushy or [...] "witches' broom" [...] {{appearance}} due {{to changes in}} their normal growth patterns. Most plants exhibit <b>apical</b> <b>dominance</b> but infection can trigger the proliferation of auxiliary (side) shoots {{and a reduction in}} internode size. Such symptoms are actually useful in the commercial production of poinsettias. Infection triggers more axillary shoot production; the poinsettia plants thus produce more than a single flower.|$|E
5000|$|Typically, {{the end of}} a shoot {{contains}} an apical bud, which is the location where shoot growth occurs. The apical bud produces an auxin (IAA) that inhibits growth of the lateral buds further down on the stem towards the axillary bud. It was first discovered that the plant hormone auxin likely regulates <b>apical</b> <b>dominance</b> in 1934. Auxin is predominantly produced in the growing shoot apex and is transported throughout the plant via the phloem and diffuses into lateral buds which prevents elongation.|$|E
50|$|Elongation is {{controlled}} by the plant hormones called auxins, which are produced by the growing tip to maintain <b>apical</b> <b>dominance.</b> Auxin diffuses, and is transported, downwards from the tip, with effects including suppressing growth of lateral buds. Auxins are active in light; when they are active they stimulate proton pumps in the cell wall which increases the acidity of the cell wall and activates expansin (an enzyme that breaks bonds in the cell wall structure) that weaken the cell wall and allow the cell to expand.|$|E
50|$|Auxin induces shoot apical dominance; the {{axillary}} buds are inhibited by auxin, as a {{high concentration}} of auxin directly stimulates ethylene synthesis in axillary buds, causing inhibition of their growth and potentiation of <b>apical</b> <b>dominance.</b> When the apex of the plant is removed, the inhibitory effect is removed and the growth of lateral buds is enhanced. Auxin is sent to the part of the plant facing away from the light, where it promotes cell elongation, thus causing the plant to bend towards the light.|$|E
5000|$|Diprogulic acid (also {{known as}} dikegulac) is a {{precursor}} used in commercial ascorbic acid production. [...] In agriculture, its sodium salt, dikegulac sodium, {{is used as}} a plant growth regulator, primarily used as a branching agent. When it is taken up by a plant, dikegulac sodium is translocated to its apical meristems, where it inhibits DNA synthesis. [...] This suppresses <b>apical</b> <b>dominance</b> in the plant and can stimulate lateral branching, resulting in a bushier growth habit. [...] Dikegulac sodium is sometimes used to inhibit fruiting and flowering.|$|E
5000|$|These stages {{can also}} be defined by the hormones that are {{regulating}} the process which are as follows: Stage I, cytokinin promoted, causing the lateral bud to form since cytokinin {{plays a role in}} cell division; Stage II, auxin is promoted, resulting in <b>apical</b> <b>dominance</b> ("imposition of inhibition"); Stage III, cytokinin released resulting in outward growth of the lateral bud; and Stage IV, auxin is decreased and gibberellic acid is promoted which results in cell division, enabling the bud or branch to continue outward growth.|$|E
50|$|The {{large number}} of studies {{indicating}} overcompensation in plants following herbivory, especially after apical meristem damage, has led some authors {{to suggest that there}} may be mutualistic relationships between plants and herbivores (Belsky 1986; Agrawal 2000; Edwards 2009). If herbivores provide some benefit for the plant despite causing damage, the plant may evolve tolerance to minimize the damage imposed by the herbivore to shift the relationship more towards mutualism (Edwards 2009). Such benefits include the release from <b>apical</b> <b>dominance,</b> inducing resistance traits to temporally separate herbivores, providing information of future attacks and pollination (Agrawal 2000).|$|E
5000|$|In botany, {{the term}} is most often applied to leaf blades that partly wrap or have wings around the stem or petiole and extend down along the stem. A [...] "decurrent {{branching}} habit" [...] is a plant form common for shrubs and most angiosperm trees, contrasted with the excurrent or [...] "cone-shaped crown" [...] common among many gymnosperms. The decurrent habit is characterized by having weak <b>apical</b> <b>dominance</b> that eventually produces a rounded or spreading tree crown. Examples of trees with decurrent habit are most hardwood trees: oak, hickory, maple, etc.|$|E
50|$|Cushion plants form large, {{low-growing mats}} that can {{grow up to}} 3 m in diameter. The typical form is a compact mass of closely spaced stems with minimal <b>apical</b> <b>dominance</b> that {{terminate}} in individual rosettes. Each stem grows at a consistent rate {{so that no one}} rosette is more exposed {{than the rest of the}} cushion. Observations on senescence have concluded that cushion plants typically die en masse rather than individual rosettes dying at separate times. Underneath the living rosettes, the plants typically produce nonphotosynthetic material or allow previous leaves to die, creating an insulating effect.|$|E
50|$|Reiterations are {{identified}} by an upturned branch that had gained <b>apical</b> <b>dominance</b> and formed an additional branch supporting trunk. Reiteration lengths are terminated {{at the point}} of trunk contact. Trunk reiterations are measured and added to the final trunk volume. A bifurcation is defined as a split or fork in the trunk that forms two or more often similarly sized ascending trunks. Bifurcations often form an irregularly shaped fused section that cannot be accurately measured with a tape for the purpose of computing cross-sectional area. All bifurcation lengths are terminated at estimated pith origination from the main stem.|$|E
50|$|When the apical bud is removed, the lowered IAA {{concentration}} {{allows the}} lateral buds {{to grow and}} produce new shoots, which compete to become the lead growth. Pruning techniques such as coppicing and pollarding make use of this natural response to damage to direct plant growth and produce a desired shape, size, and/or productivity level for the plant. The principle of <b>apical</b> <b>dominance</b> is manipulated for espalier creation, hedge building, or artistic sculptures called topiary. If the SAM is removed, it stimulates growth in the lateral direction. By careful pruning, {{it is possible to}} create remarkable designs or patterns.|$|E
