5|$|Arha and Kossil have {{a public}} falling out in which Kossil says that nobody {{believes}} in the Nameless Ones anymore. In response Arha curses her {{in the name of}} the Nameless Ones. Realizing that Kossil will now be determined to kill her, she heads underground to the labyrinth, and sees Kossil uncovering the false grave. Evading her, Arha goes to the treasury and confesses everything to Ged, who has found the other half of Erreth-Akbe's ring in the treasury. He tells Arha that she must either kill him or escape with him, and says that the Nameless Ones demand her service but give nothing and create nothing in return. He tells her his true name, Ged, in return for the trust she has shown him. They escape together, though Manan, who has come looking for Arha, falls into a pit in the labyrinth and is killed. The tombs begin to collapse in on themselves; Ged holds them off until they leave. Arha reverts to calling herself Tenar as she and Ged travel to the coast where his boat is hidden. While waiting for the tide she has <b>an</b> <b>urge</b> to kill Ged for destroying her life, but realizes while gazing at him that she has no anger left. Ged and Tenar return to Havnor, where they are received in triumph.|$|E

25|$|Various studies {{indicate}} that the perceived intention to move (have moved) can be manipulated. Studies {{have focused on the}} pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) of the brain, in which readiness potential indicating the beginning of a movement genesis has been recorded by EEG. In one study, directly stimulating the pre-SMA caused volunteers to report a feeling of intention, and sufficient stimulation of that same area caused physical movement. In a similar study, it was found that people with no visual awareness of their body can have their limbs be made to move without having any awareness of this movement, by stimulating premotor brain regions. When their parietal cortices were stimulated, they reported <b>an</b> <b>urge</b> (intention) to move a specific limb (that they wanted to do so). Furthermore, stronger stimulation of the parietal cortex resulted in the illusion of having moved without having done so.|$|E

25|$|In most media, Skaro {{is portrayed}} as a nuclear wasteland and almost entirely devoid of plant life, with only a petrified forest located close to the Dalek city. Several {{exceptions}} are mentioned, however. Varga plants, resembling large, motile cacti studded with poisonous thorns, are seen in Mission to the Unknown (1965). Native to Skaro, they have been deliberately mutated by the Daleks to act as sentries and deter other life forms from interfering with their activities. An individual poisoned by the thorns develops <b>an</b> <b>urge</b> to kill and eventually transforms into another Varga plant. The Arkellis flower is described as being rare and only able to root in metal, with its sap being a constituent of the Golden Emperor Dalek’s metallic casing. In the TV21 comic strip The Daleks, dense undergrowth is depicted on several occasions, most notably in the mercury geyser swamps and the mutated forest.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, the Home Office {{issued a}} report on {{research}} examining the level {{and nature of the}} use of khat by Somalis in four English cities; Birmingham, Bristol, London and Sheffield. It found that 38 per cent of the respondents had ever used khat in their lifetime, with 58 per cent of men and only 16 per cent of women reporting having ever used it. 34 per cent of the overall sample indicated that they had chewed khat the month before, with 51 per cent all men in the study and 14 per cent of the women having done so. Some reported family tensions arising from their khat use. 49 per cent of those surveyed were in favour of banning khat, with 35 opposed, but the report suggested that this would not be effective. Three quarters of participants who had used khat reported having suffered health effects, although these were mostly mild in nature, with the most common symptoms respondents associated with khat use being sleeping difficulties, loss of appetite, and <b>an</b> <b>urge</b> to chew more khat. The study concluded that most of the participants who were using khat were using it moderately in terms of both the quantity used and the frequency and duration of chewing sessions, and that khat use was typically a social activity. Only a small minority of the study participants' khat use was judged to be excessive. In January 2013, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs also again cited insufficient evidence that the plant caused serious health or societal problems to warrant governmental control.|$|E

500|$|Reflecting on the series' progression, Eurogamer Chris Schilling {{said that}} Saints Row IV {{successfully}} reinvented the series yet again, with superpowers replacing {{the usefulness of}} in-game vehicles. He compared the game's exploration mechanics to that of Crackdown, and its superpowers to the Infamous and Prototype series, and added that the game's silliness fulfilled a specific niche in gaming. Schilling wrote that the need to restock at ammo shops was a [...] "jarring holdover" [...] from the previous games, but appreciated the recurrence of elements such as the GPS navigation system, side mission gameplay, and city district liberation. He regarded the game overall as artful but [...] "gloriously dumb", like [...] "the Sistine Chapel ceiling of stupidity". Schilling also commented on how he felt <b>an</b> <b>urge</b> to simply forgo the story to search for collectibles, though despite these options, the game became [...] "wearying" [...] over long play sessions.|$|E

In a different article for Billboard talking about the song's remixes, Paoletta described the track as [...] "effervescent blast of psychedelic electronica". Writing for the Philippine Daily Inquirer, Gino DeLa Paz found it [...] "cute but forgettable". Gwen Ihnat, from the entertainment website The A.V. Club, labeled it as [...] "Madonna's best song that never appeared on one of her regular albums [...] a psychedelic pop confection that offered a few of her most indelible hooks". Ihnat also wrote that [...] "although less ethereal than 1998's Ray of Light, [...] is just as dance-floor ready [...] dance flute has never sounded so enticing, and Madonna's voice so sweetly seductive". AllMusic's Jose F. Promis listed the track [...] "as one of the singer's more memorable moments, coupling 1960s go-go rock with 1990s electronica, resulting in nothing less than a true slice of old fashioned rock & roll"; Promis also praised the two Calderone mixes.|$|E
500|$|In 1898 Bondfield {{accepted}} {{the job of}} assistant secretary of NUSAWC, which that year became [...] "NAUSAWC" [...] after amalgamating with the United Shop Assistants' Union. From this time onward she subordinated her life to her union work and to the wider cause of socialism. She [...] "had no vocation for wifehood or motherhood, but <b>an</b> <b>urge</b> to serve the Union... I had 'the dear love of comrades' [...] ". At the time the union's membership, at under 3,000, represented {{only a small fraction}} of shopworkers, and Bondfield gave priority to increasing this proportion. For months she travelled the country, distributing literature and arranging meetings when she could, with mixed outcomes in the face of apathy from shop staff, and outright opposition from shopowners. In Reading and Bristol she reported no success, although in Gloucester, she thought, [...] "it should not be difficult to organise every shop worker". In 1899 Bondfield was the first woman delegate to the Trades Union Annual Congress, that year held in Plymouth, where she participated in the vote that led to the formation in 1900 of the Labour Representation Committee (LRC), forerunner of the Labour Party. NAUSAWC, its membership by then around 7,000, was one of the first unions to affiliate to the committee.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the abnormal movements of other movement disorders (for example, choreas, dystonias, myoclonus, and dyskinesias), the tics of Tourette's are temporarily suppressible, nonrhythmic, and often preceded by an unwanted premonitory urge. Immediately preceding tic onset, most individuals with Tourette's are aware of <b>an</b> <b>urge,</b> similar {{to the need to}} sneeze or scratch an itch. Individuals describe the need to tic as a buildup of tension, pressure, or energy which they consciously choose to release, as if they [...] "had to do it" [...] to relieve the sensation or until it feels [...] "just right". Examples of the premonitory urge are the feeling of having something in one's throat, or a localized discomfort in the shoulders, leading to the need to clear one's throat or shrug the shoulders. The actual tic may be felt as relieving this tension or sensation, similar to scratching an itch. Another example is blinking to relieve an uncomfortable sensation in the eye. These urges and sensations, preceding the expression of the movement or vocalization as a tic, are referred to as [...] "premonitory sensory phenomena" [...] or premonitory urges. Because of the urges that precede them, tics are described as semi-voluntary or [...] "unvoluntary", rather than specifically involuntary; they may be experienced as a voluntary, suppressible response to the unwanted premonitory urge. Published descriptions of the tics of Tourette's identify sensory phenomena as the core symptom of the syndrome, even though they are not included in the diagnostic criteria.|$|E

Evan Rytlewski of The A.V.

Mike Diver of Clash felt surprised by Miguel's writing contribution mostly due to the sound showcased in the song. Nows Julia LeConte listed the song as the best on the entire album. Andy Kellman from AllMusic called [...] "Rocket" [...] the second best song on Beyoncé, deeming it an [...] "amusing mix of metaphorical and explicit come-ons" [...] with an [...] "elegant" [...] opening line. Similarly, Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone provided a positive review for the [...] "squishy" [...] tune where Beyoncé [...] "hits nasty highs", further praising the first line as a nice song-opener.

500|$|Frusciante's guitar playing employs {{emphasis}} on appropriate melody, tone, and structure rather than virtuosity. Although virtuoso influences {{can be heard}} throughout his career, {{he has said that}} he often minimizes this. He feels that in general, guitar mastery has not evolved much since the 1960s and considers the greatest players of that decade unsurpassed. When he was growing up in the 1980s, many mainstream guitarists focused on speed. Because of this, he thinks that the skills of many defiant new wave and punk guitarists were largely overlooked. Therefore, he accentuates the melodically-driven technique of players such as Matthew Ashman of Bow Wow Wow and Bernard Sumner of Joy Division as much as possible because he thinks that their style has been overlooked and consequently underexplored. Despite this, he considers himself a fan of technique-driven guitarists like Randy Rhoads and Steve Vai, but represses <b>an</b> <b>urge</b> to emulate their style: [...] "People believe that by playing faster and creating new playing techniques you can progress forward, but then they realize that emotionally they don't progress at all. They transmit nothing to the people listening and they stay at where Hendrix was three decades ago. Something like that happened to Vai in the 80s." [...] Believing that focusing only on [...] "clean tones" [...] is negative, Frusciante developed an interest in playing with what he calls a [...] "grimy" [...] sound. As a result, he considers it beneficial to [...] "mistreat" [...] his guitar and employ various forms of distortion when soloing. He also tries to break as many [...] "stylistic boundaries" [...] as he can to expand his musical horizons. He thinks that much of the output from today's guitarists is unoriginal, and that many of his contemporaries [...] "follow the rules with no risk".|$|E
500|$|Monica has a {{complicated}} {{relationship with her}} parents Jack (Elliot Gould) and Judy Geller (Christina Pickles), more-so with her mother. Entertainment Weekly referred to the character's relationship with her parents as [...] "esteem-sucking." [...] In fact, the majority of Friends main characters have [...] "strained relationships" [...] with their parents. Described as [...] "hypercritical," [...] Judy enjoys constantly criticizing her daughter's appearance, career, and love life, while acting much kinder towards her son, who she favors. Chelsea Mize of Bustle wrote that Monica and Ross' [...] "wacky quirks become all the more understandable after ... seeing them with their parents." [...] Encyclopedia of Television Shows, 1925 through 2010 author Vincent Terrance believes that Monica's competitiveness originates from having grown up with Ross as a brother, against whom she often competed as a child. Kriti Tulsiani of IBNLive described Monica and Ross' relationship as [...] "A blend of love and sibling jealousy with <b>an</b> <b>urge</b> to irritate each other to the deepest core of existence", with Ross often making fun of his sister's weight and Monica teasing him about his several failed marriages in return. In terms of ethnicity, Crane confirmed that both Monica and Ross are half-Jewish, with their father being Jewish and their mother being of non-Jewish European ancestry. However, Television's Changing Image of American Jews categorized Monica as a [...] "masked" [...] Jew, explaining that [...] "the smart, funny, and insecure Ross seems more Jewish" [...] than Monica, who the author dismissed as [...] "china-doll like" [...] in appearance and demeanor.
