25|$|Novak {{strongly}} supported wars in Korea, Vietnam, and Grenada, {{but he took}} an anti-interventionist stance after that. He was a hard-line social conservative as well, holding pro-life and anti-divorce views. He also generally tended toward low-tax, small-government libertarian views, but his disagreements with mainstream Republicans and neoconservatives—specifically {{his opposition to the}} Iraq War—earned him the label of being a “paleoconservative.” Novak's political column once stated that he considered every single president in his lifetime to be a failure, with the lone exception of Reagan. After Novak’s death on August 18, 2009, Chicago Sun-Times described him as an independent voice. The Daily Telegraph stated that Novak felt “glee” <b>at</b> <b>starting</b> interparty fighting.|$|E
25|$|Regarded {{as one of}} the {{greatest}} players in his position, Rijkaard was a quick, strong, complete and tenacious defensive midfielder who was praised by pundits throughout his career for his physical and athletic attributes, his work rate, positioning, his acute tactical intelligence and decision-making, as well as his outstanding consistency and ability to read the game. Due to his aggression and versatility, he was also capable of playing in a defensive role, usually in the centre. Rijkaard was a strong tackler, with good technique and vision, which made him adept <b>at</b> <b>starting</b> attacking plays as a deep-lying playmaker once he won back possession.

25|$|The {{break-out}} of the Second World War {{resulted in}} the need for increased coal production in Norway, and the Ministry of Trade and Industry appointed committee to consider production increases. Its conclusions were announced on 5 April, where it was recommended that production resume in Ny-Ålesund. Kings Bay aimed <b>at</b> <b>starting</b> production from the summer of 1941, as the war made earlier production start difficult. The town was re-settled on 7 May 1941 and work started in the Ester II Mine. However, production would not last long. The Allied commanders determined {{that they would not}} prioritize to protect Svalbard and determined in August that they would evacuate the island. A fleet arrived on 25 August and evacuated the population on 29 August. Critical infrastructure, such as the power station and the railways, were blown up.|$|E
25|$|The {{bowling ball}} speed is {{affected}} primarily by three factors: gravitational forces, forward momentum, and downswing acceleration. The {{speed of the}} ball as generated by gravitational forces during the swing depends primarily on the total arc of the swing. This arc is further affected by {{the length of the}} bowler’s arm and by the height at which the swing begins. Assuming a longer arm and higher swing peak will maximize the speed that the gravitational forces produce. Forward momentum is manifested in the walking approach of the bowler prior to the throw. The “four-step” approach is most commonly applied, with the right foot slightly ahead of the left <b>at</b> <b>starting</b> position (for right handed bowlers). Longer legs and a faster approach during the third step and downswing will increase the ball speed. Finally, the deliberate acceleration of the arm during downswing is of critical focus. This particular factor is difficult to master, however, because one can easily force the armswing and thus accelerate too quickly or cause the arm to deviate from the natural path.|$|E

2500|$|All but {{two were}} built with a {{featured}} a Franklin C2 type Booster engine on the trailing truck axle, following a successful {{trial of a}} booster on the smaller N class light lines 2-8-2. The booster allowed an additional [...] tractive effort <b>at</b> <b>starting</b> and low speeds to increase the hauling power of the locomotive, particularly on heavy grades. X36 and X37 were built without boosters and were rostered for 'plains working' on the relatively flat line between Gheringhap and Maroona stations. X37 was equipped with a booster in March 1932, however X36 was never fitted with one, even though its trailing truck axle was equipped with the necessary pinion gear wheel.|$|E
2500|$|The {{traction}} motors by Siemens were series-wound [...] gearless motors on the axles. The trains ran in a formation of four cars, the two outer vehicles being motor coaches. [...] The motor cars were constructed to allow an early form of multiple unit operation {{and the front}} car's controller was additionally {{able to control the}} rear car's motors. [...] The two motors at each end were connected in series <b>at</b> <b>starting,</b> then reconnected in parallel (using open circuit transition) as the train accelerated in the well established (at that time) method. [...] This required eight cables to be run the length of the train at roof level. [...] A further cable making nine in all linked the collector shoes at opposite ends of the four-car set to avoid problems with the large gaps in the centrally mounted conductor rail.|$|E

2500|$|Problems became {{apparent}} very soon. The locomotives were incredibly susceptible to violent wheelslip, not just <b>at</b> <b>starting</b> {{but also at}} speed. Dividing the drive into two groups meant that each group was {{much more likely to}} slip. A theory has been advanced that the more rapid, [...] "sharper" [...] opening of the valves with the poppet valve gear exacerbated the problem. Worse, such violent high-speed slipping could damage the valve gear components. This was major problem on a locomotive with the poppet valve gear because, unlike the familiar piston valves and outside Walschaerts valve gear of other locomotives, many of the components were nearly inaccessible within the frame. Their complexity meant that availability and reliability proved poor, and while a very capable locomotive engineer (driver) could extract great performance from a T1, they proved rather unsuccessful in service.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} said that Archimedes used a large array of mirrors to burn Roman ships during an attack on Syracuse. This has never been proven or disproved; however, it has been put to the test. Recently, on a popular Discovery Channel show, MythBusters, a team from MIT tried to {{recreate}} the famous [...] "Archimedes Death Ray". They were [...] <b>at</b> <b>starting</b> a fire on the ship. Previous attempts to light the boat on fire using only the bronze mirrors available in Archimedes' time were unsuccessful, and the time taken to ignite the craft would have made its use impractical, resulting in the MythBusters team deeming the myth [...] "busted". It was however found that the mirrors made it very difficult for the passengers of the targeted boat to see, likely helping to cause their defeat, which may have been the origin of the myth.

2500|$|L59's two initial {{attempts}} <b>at</b> <b>starting</b> {{the journey}} were foiled by {{weather in the}} Mediterranean, but on 21 November 1917 her third departure was successful. The ship made good time over Adrianople, the Sea of Marmara and the coast of Asia Minor. However, due to electrical storms over Crete, her wireless aerial was wound in and so the ship failed to receive messages from the German admiralty. [...] She crossed over the African coast at 05:15 on 22 November near Mersa Matruh and, flying via the Dakhla Oasis set a dog-leg course up the Nile. That afternoon, an engine malfunctioned when a reduction gear housing cracked; the loss of this powerplant eliminated the prospect of radio transmission, although wireless messages could be received. The next morning she nearly crashed when heat turbulence from the dunes below and subsequent cooling reduced the buoyancy of her gas. The crew also suffered from headaches, hallucinations and general fatigue in the mid-day heat and freezing cold at night.|$|E
2500|$|Rayner engaged Charles Broad {{to convert}} {{and extend the}} {{original}} building as a theatre. This was built in 1832 in seven weeks, {{at a cost of}} £3,000. The theatre opened on 15 January 1832, as Rayner's New Subscription Theatre, with a production of Struggles <b>at</b> <b>Starting.</b> Within weeks, the venture failed and was sold to the actress Harriet Waylett, re-opening as The New Strand (Subscription) Theatre. Again, the theatre lacked support and closed in November 1832. The theatre was re-opened in early 1833 as the [...] New Strand Theatre, by Fanny Kelly [...] who also based a drama school there. The singer, Rebecca Isaacs was the Directress of Operas at the theatre from 1852 to 1853, and again in 1855. The theatre failed because it was unlicensed, and this put it into competition with London's patent theatres. Presenting plays by subscription was one method of evading the Acts, but tickets could not be sold at the theatre. This was circumvented by selling them at neighbouring shops; and at one point the public were admitted free on purchase of an ounce of rose lozenges for four shillings (stalls), or half an ounce of peppermint drops for two shillings (the pit) from the neighbouring confectioners.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{the earlier}} {{attempts}} at bands, The Waterfront fizzled out, but in late 1983 Couzens {{decided to try}} again <b>at</b> <b>starting</b> a band, and approached Brown. They decided on Wolstencroft (who had turned down the job of drummer in The Smiths) as drummer and Pete Garner as bassist (despite his admission {{that he could not}} play anything but [...] "Block Buster!"). They also decided that they needed Squire in the band, and when he agreed the band's line-up was cemented. Leaving their previous bands behind, they worked solely on new material. Brown's vocal limitations prompted him to take singing lessons for three weeks. After rehearsing for some time without a band name, Squire came up with [...] "The Stone Roses". Several stories later emerged suggesting that the band had initially been called [...] "English Rose" [...] or that the name was somehow linked to The Rolling Stones, but these were untrue, Brown explaining [...] "No, I don't know where that English Rose story came from. John thought up the name [...] "Stone Roses" [...] - something with a contrast, two words that went against each other". The band rehearsed for six months, during which time Wolstencroft had been auditioning for other bands, and he left to join Terry Hall's band The Colourfield. They got Goodwin to rejoin, but he lasted for only one rehearsal, so they advertised for a replacement and began auditioning, eventually recruiting Alan Wren in May 1984.|$|E
