David Harris Willson's 1956 biography continued {{much of this}} hostility. In the words of historian Jenny Wormald, Willson's book was an [...] "astonishing spectacle of a work whose every page proclaimed its author's increasing hatred for his subject". Since Willson, however, the stability of James's government in Scotland {{and in the early}} part of his English reign, as well as his relatively enlightened views on religion and war, have earned him <b>a</b> <b>re-evaluation</b> <b>from</b> many historians, who have rescued his reputation from this tradition of criticism.|$|E
40|$|Regulatory {{reforms in}} the {{telecommunications}} sector in Africa {{and the rest of}} the world have been necessitated by the convergence of information and communication technology industries. Given the relative newness of the sector in Africa, information and communication technology implementation problems persist. Research in the sector has tended to attribute implementation problems to technological issues. While not contesting this, this paper contends that information and communication technology implementation in Africa warrants <b>a</b> <b>re-evaluation</b> <b>from</b> the perspective of policy making processes. Drawing on two case studies, this paper critically examines the licensing policy option as documented in the Kenya Communications Act and as implemented by the regulator in Kenya. This analysis is situated within public policy frameworks that highlight the function of domestic institutions and patterns of politics as highly critical filters in policy making, thus influencing actor behaviour and impacting on implementation outcomes in the policy making processes. The findings are that policy making and information and communication technology implementation in Kenya are influenced by institutional/policy arrangements and the contextual forces of ideological, political, social and economic interests. This has significant implications for Kenya, particularly as the study reinforces the call for a critical examination of the policy actors and policy choices that govern information and communication technology regulation and implementation. The study findings also have implications for other African countries, in that the study questions the viability of such policy choices for creating information/knowledge societies in Africa. The analysis in this paper is based on document research and fieldwork, and forms part of a wider study on policy options and implementation processes as enacted through the regulation of the telecommunications sector in Kenya.

40|$|Gliadel wafers are {{the only}} local {{chemotherapeutic}} agent approved {{for the treatment of}} primary and recurrent malignant gliomas. Since the approval, considerable clinical experiences in multimodal regimens have been made and require <b>a</b> <b>re-evaluation</b> <b>from</b> a neurosurgical point of view. We reviewed the database entries from Medline, EMBASE, and BIOSIS from 2005  2012. Search terms included: gliadel, carmustine, or BCNU wafer, implant and complications or adverse events (AE). Endpoints of our analysis were efficacy and safety data of gliadel for primary and recurrent glioblastomas. AEs included intracranial infections, oedema, healing abnormalities, CSF fistulae, and hydrocephalus. For primary glioblastomas (GBM), median progression- free survival (PFS) reached 12. 3 months and overall survival (OAS) ranged from 19. 2  20. 7 months. For recurrences, the 6 -month OAS was 82 %, 1 - and 2 -year OAS rates were 47 % and 10 %, respectively. Median OAS was 50. 3 weeks. AE rates for primary GBMs ranged from 0. 8  16. 7 % for cerebral oedema, from 4. 4  8. 3 % for healing abnormalities, 5. 5 % for liquor leaks, from 0. 0  47. 0 % for hydrocephalus, and 4. 8 % for intracranial infection. AE rates for recurrent glioblastomas ranged from 0. 0  7. 2 % for cerebral oedema, from 4. 8  55. 6 % for healing abnormalities, from 4. 8  33. 3 % for CSF fistulae, from 0. 6  22. 2 % for hydrocephalus and 5. 0 % for intracranial infection. The use of gliadel wafers is determined by the individual decision of the responsible neurosurgeon due to the absence of general guidelines. The AE rates reported in current treatment strategies are relatively low...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{comprehensive}} {{treatment of}} the mathematical basis for modeling the disinfection process for air using ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI). A complete mathematical description of the survival curve is developed that incorporates both a two stage inactivation curve and a shoulder. A methodology {{for the evaluation of}} the three-dimensional intensity fields around UV lamps and within reflective enclosures is summarized that will enable determination of the UV dose absorbed by aerosolized microbes. The results of past UVGI studies on airborne pathogens are tabulated. The airborne rate constant for Bacillus subtilis is confirmed based on results of an independent test. <b>A</b> <b>re-evaluation</b> of data <b>from</b> several previous studies demonstrates the application of the shoulder and two-stage models. The methods presented here will enable accurate interpretation of experimental results involving aerosolized microorganisms exposed to UVGI and associated relative humidity effects Key words: UVGI, UV air disinfection, surface disinfection, survival curve, decay curve 1...|$|R

40|$|Many {{studies in}} {{continental}} areas have successfully used the oxygen isotope composition of fossil ostracod valves to reconstruct past hydrological conditions associated with large changes in climate. Yet, ostracods {{are known to}} crystallise their valves out of isotopic equilibrium for oxygen and they generally have higher 18 O contents compared to inorganic calcite grown at equilibrium under the same condi- tions. A review of vital offsets determined for continental ostracods indicates that vital offsets might change from site to site, questioning a potential influence of environmental conditions on oxygen isotope fractionation in ostracods. Results from the literature suggest that pH has no influence on ostracod vital offset. <b>A</b> <b>re-evaluation</b> of results <b>from</b> Li and Liu (J Paleolimnol 43 : 111 - 120, 2010) suggests that salin- ity may influence oxygen isotope fractionation in ostracods, with lower vital offsets for higher salinities. Such a relationship was also observed for the vital offsets determined by Chivas et al. (The ostracoda- applications in quaternary research. American Geo- physical Union, Washington, DC, 2002). Yet, when results of all studies are compiled, the correlation between vital offsets and salinity is low while the correlation between vital offsets and host water Mg/Ca is higher, suggesting that ionic composition of water and/or relative abundance of major ions may also control oxygen isotope fractionation in ostracods. Lack of data on host water ionic composition for the different studies precludes more detailed examination at this stage. Further studies such as natural or laboratory cultures done under strictly controlled conditions are needed {{to better understand the}} potential influence of varying environmental condi- tions on oxygen isotope compositions of ostracod valves...|$|R
