We added peptides to normal citrated whole blood before perfusion over human umbilical artery subendothelium and evaluated platelet adherence morphometrically at high (2, 600 s- 1) and low (800 s- 1) wall shear rates. We also {{examined the effects of}} the peptides on platelet adhesion to collagen in a static system. At the high wall shear rate, RGDS and GQQHHLGGAKQAGDV caused dose-dependent reduction in the surface coverage with spread and adherent platelets. Amino acid transposition and conservative substitutions of RGD peptides and the AGDV peptide significantly inhibited platelet adherence at 2, 600 s- 1. By contrast, the modified RGD peptides and AGDV do not affect <b>adhesive</b> protein <b>binding</b> to platelets. None of the native or modified RGD- or fibrinogen gamma-chain peptides significantly inhibited either platelet adherence to subendothelium at 800 s- 1 or platelet adhesion to collagen.

The extended molecule expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells bound to CD 2 on T lymphocytes 4 - to 20 -fold more efficiently than the wild-type molecule at 4 degrees C. Treatment of the CHO clones with neuraminidase to remove sialic acid, or with deoxymannojirimycin to reduce the bulk of N-linked glycosylation, showed that adhesion to both the wild-type and the chimeric LFA- 3 molecules was {{under the influence of}} cell-cell repulsive forces to a similar extent and that these treatments had less effect than lengthening LFA- 3. At higher temperatures, such as 22 and 37 degrees C, the efficiency of binding to the wild-type LFA- 3 increased to levels comparable with binding to extended LFA- 3. Our results suggest that more distal locations of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>binding</b> site from the cell membrane anchor increase the efficiency of cell-cell adhesion by enhancing the frequency of receptor encounter with ligand and that more proximal locations of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>binding</b> site can provide efficient cell-cell adhesion at physiological temperatures...|$|E

40|$|A plough is {{typically}} used by fine binders to trim a textblock to produce smooth, even edges. A book {{is placed in}} the press of the plough and a blade is drawn perpendicular to the book {{along the length of the}} textblock, slicing through it a few sheets at a time. For conservation purposes, a plough (or guillotine) is used to trim off the damaged spine of adhesive-bound books in preparation for rebinding using the double fan adhesive method (DFA). The DFA method deposits tiny amounts of glue on either side of individual pages, essentially tipping them to each other, therefore a smoothly trimmed spine edge is crucial for this binding’s success and mechanical stability. A DFA bound book has a very strong and flexible textblock that will remain more resilient than commercial <b>adhesive</b> <b>bindings</b> which are prone to failing, especially under heavy use. Hybrid or general collections labs that rebind large quantities of books using the DFA method will typically invest in a guillotine or plough which can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars. Working in a primarily special collections lab, the only opportunity I have to perform this type of rebinding is when one of our reference books becomes damaged and/or the original binding has failed. Therefore, I could not justify spending hundreds of dollars for a piece of equipment that may be used only a few times per year, regardless of how handy it would be.

Despite the importance of cadherins in morphogenesis and development, we {{know very little about}} how cells determine and alter cadherin adhesive strength. In this study, we sought to identify specific cellular mechanisms that modulate cadherin function by studying adhesion between cells transfected with Xenopus C-cadherin mutant molecules and substrata coated with the purified ectodomain of C-cadherin. Results: Using the FKBP–FK 1012 protein oligomerization system, we found that forced clustering, in cells, of cadherin mutants lacking the cytoplasmic tail significantly increased cellular adhesive strength. Therefore, redistribution of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>binding</b> sites of cells into clusters can influence adhesion independently of other protein interactions mediated by the cadherin cytoplasmic tail. Furthermore, cells transfected with full-length C-cadherin demonstrated dynamic changes in adhesion over time that correlated with clustering but not with changes in the surface expression of C-cadherin or in the composition of the cadherin–catenin complex. The cytoplasmic tail was, however, necessary for clustering of wild-type cadherin. Conclusions: These studies directly demonstrate a fundamental role for lateral clustering in cadherin function. The distribution of cadherin binding sites presented at the cell surface, a cellular property which is regulated by the cadherin cytoplasmic tail, is an important mechanism which modulates cellular adhesion independently of cytoskeletal activity or signalling...|$|E

40|$|Desmosomes and adherens {{junctions}} are cadherin-based protein complexes {{responsible for}} cell-cell adhesion of epithelial cells. Type 1 cadherins of adherens junctions show specific homophilic adhesion that {{plays a major}} role in developmental tissue segregation. The desmosomal cadherins, desmocollin and desmoglein, occur as several different isoforms with overlapping expression in some tissues where different isoforms are located in the same desmosomes. Although <b>adhesive</b> <b>binding</b> of desmosomal cadherins has been investigated in a variety of ways, their interaction in desmosome-forming epithelial cells has not been studied. Here, using extracellular homobifunctional cross-linking, we provide evidence for homophilic and isoform-specific binding between the Dsc 2, Dsc 3, Dsg 2, and Dsg 3 isoforms in HaCaT keratinocytes and show that it represents trans interaction. Furthermore, the cross-linked adducts are present in the detergent-insoluble fraction, and electron microscopy shows that extracellular cross-linking probably occurs in desmosomes. We found no evidence for either heterophilic or cis interaction, but neither can be completely excluded by our data. Mutation of amino acid residues Trp- 2 and Ala- 80 that are important for trans interaction in classical cadherin <b>adhesive</b> <b>binding</b> abolished Dsc 2 binding, indicating that these residues are also involved in desmosomal adhesion. These interactions of desmosomal cadherins may be of key importance for their ordered arrangement within desmosomes that we believe is essential for desmosomal adhesive strength and the maintenance of tissue integrity...|$|E

40|$|Calpain (a Ca(2 +) -dependent protease) {{is present}} in many cell types. Because it {{is present in}} the cytosol, the {{potential}} exists that it may regulate critical intracellular events by inducing crucial proteolytic cleavages. However, the concentrations of Ca 2 + required to activate calpain are higher than those attained in the cytoplasm of most cells. Thus, the physiological importance of calpain and the mechanisms involved in its activation have remained elusive. In this study, we show that calpain rapidly moved to a peripheral location upon the addition of an agonist to suspensions of platelets, but it remained unactivated. We provide three lines of evidence that calpain was subsequently activated by a mechanism that required the <b>binding</b> of an <b>adhesive</b> ligand to the major platelet integrin, glycoprotein (GP) IIb- IIIa: calpain activation was prevented by RGDS, a tetrapeptide that inhibits the <b>binding</b> of <b>adhesive</b> ligand to GP IIb-IIIa; it was also prevented by monoclonal antibodies that inhibit <b>adhesive</b> ligand <b>binding</b> to GP IIb-IIIa; and its activation was markedly reduced in platelets from patients whose platelets have greatly reduced levels of functional GP IIb-IIIa. Thus, in platelets, binding of the extracellular domain of GP IIb-IIIa to its adhesive ligand can initiate a transmembrane signal that activates intracellular calpain. Because calpain is present in focal contacts of adherent cells, the interaction of integrins with adhesive ligands in the extracellular matrix may regulate activation of calpain in other cell types as well...|$|R

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{has examined the}} <b>adhesive</b> <b>binding</b> of paper, with {{particular attention to the}} action of the fiber/adhesive interface. The efforts of this research were concentrated on relating properties of the paper to strength of the resultant binding. To simulate the problems of economical binding styles, uncoated groundwood paper and hot melt adhesives were studied. Although the hypotheses assumed that a strong interfiber bond within the sheets would lead to a strong binding, {{it was found that the}} most critical factor was not the strength of the sheet, but the availability of the fibers to the adhesive. The strength of the sheet was measured by several tests. These tests were: tensile strength, internal bond, tear resistance, and pick resistance. None of these measures of paper strength correlated with binding strength. Other factors, specifically caliper, absorbency, and low pick resistance proved to be the significant factors leading to a strong binding. The general conclusion is that the greater the surface area of the fibers exposed to the glue, the greater the adhesive bond. Greater caliper, absorbency, and low pick resistance lead to increased exposure of fibers and therefore to a stronger binding for newsprint -grade papers. Previous studies with both coated and uncoated papers had indicated that roughness is the most important paper quality for a good binding with hot melt adhesives. This study finds that roughness is not a significant factor, and the thickness and low pick resistance are the most significant factors leading to a good binding with uncoated groundwoods. Acidity was tested for effects on binding strength. Even with accelerated aging, no evidence was found that the acidity of the sheet affects the strength of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>binding.</b> Binding strength was measured by page pull and flex tests.

40|$|Polyethylene (PE) {{adhesives}} used {{in combination}} with a PE topcoat and a fusion bonded epoxy (FBE) {{are one of the}} most common pipeline corrosion-resistant coating systems used in the oil and gas industry. The role of the <b>adhesive</b> in <b>binding</b> the topcoat to the steel surface is critical to ensuring long term protection against corrosion attack to the pipeline. Consistent with this, it is important to understand how adhesion is optimised by controlling the physical and chemical properties of the adhesive. In this work, adhesives were produced by grafting maleic anhydride (MAH) on to the polymer backbone of an inert polyethylene via free radical chemistries during reactive processing then investigating adhesive performance as function of grafting. The effects of particle size on adhesion performance were also studied for two mean particles sizes of 300 μm and 125 μm. Overall, increasing MAH (along with increasing DBP) concentration enhanced the degree of grafting, as characterised by FTIR spectroscopy, which in turn resulted in enhanced interfacial interaction between the non-polar PE topcoat and polar FBE. However, an intermediate level of MAH was found to produce the greatest adhesion due to a subsequent increase in viscosity, as shown by changes in the melt flow index (MFI) and reduced wetting of the adhesive to the primer at higher MAH concentrations. Thermal analyses using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) confirmed that functionalization of the PE adhesive disrupted its semi-crystalline structure by reducing melting temperature (Tm) and degree of crystallinity (Xc). Investigation of the effects of particle size and coating interval time revealed that finer particle sizes of ≤ 300 μm produced further improvement in adhesion strength compared to the coarser particles size ≥ 300 μm, while longer interval times degraded the adhesion performance of the coating system. This finding suggests that, apart from grafting efficiency, selection of particle size and coating times are important considerations for achieving optimum coating adhesion performance in three-layer PE coating systems...|$|R
