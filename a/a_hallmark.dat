5|$|During {{the earlier}} seasons of the show, Maggie's {{equivalent}} of <b>a</b> <b>hallmark</b> was to trip over her clothing and fall {{on her face}} while trying to walk, causing a loud thud on the floor, but this was toned down in the later seasons. She has penchant for her pacifier, on which she is always seen sucking.|$|E
5|$|Impex {{acted as}} a front for Fatah, serving as a meeting place and conduit for funds. This became <b>a</b> <b>hallmark</b> of Abu Nidal's career.

5|$|Militant {{action was}} not <b>a</b> <b>hallmark</b> of the {{movements}} in Wales and Welsh members, who more often {{identified themselves as}} suffragists, sought Parliamentary and public support through political and peaceful means. In 1918, across the United Kingdom, women {{over the age of}} 30 gained the right to vote, followed by the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928 which saw women gain the same rights to vote as men.|$|E

5|$|The building, though {{based on}} Classical {{architecture}} {{is not entirely}} a Classical building. Its rooflines, main entrance, and the placement and style of the windows are all asymmetrical in nature, <b>a</b> <b>hallmark</b> of the Arts and Crafts style. Its simple massing and noticeable lack of ornamentation throughout the structure connects the building closely to the Arts and Crafts movement. This influence is seen most prominently on the building's interior.|$|E
5|$|Air can {{be trapped}} {{under the skin}} in necrotizing infections such as gangrene, {{occurring}} as a late sign in gas gangrene, {{of which it is}} the hallmark sign. Subcutaneous emphysema is also considered <b>a</b> <b>hallmark</b> of fournier gangrene. Symptoms of subcutaneous emphysema can result when infectious organisms produce gas by fermentation. When emphysema occurs due to infection, signs that the infection is systemic, i.e. that it has spread beyond the initial location, are also present.|$|E
5|$|Although Gillis was not {{exclusively}} used on Post covers, the Willie Gillis series of covers was <b>a</b> <b>hallmark</b> of Rockwell's wartime work. In Rockwell's prime {{and at the}} peak of its popularity, the Post had a subscribership of 4 million, and many of these subscribers believed Gillis was a real person. Rockwell's wartime art, including Willie Gillis, the Four Freedoms and Rosie the Riveter, contributed {{to the success of the}} wartime bond sales efforts.|$|E

5|$|Artificial ruins, {{built to}} {{resemble}} remnants of historic edifices, were also <b>a</b> <b>hallmark</b> of the period. They were usually built as centre pieces in aristocratic planned landscapes. Follies were similar, although they differed from artificial ruins {{in that they}} were not part of a planned landscape, but rather seemed to have no reason for being built. Both drew on elements of castle architecture such as castellation and towers, but served no military purpose and were solely for display.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the first episodes was negative, with many reviewers not liking the characters and finding the comedy drama format unusual. As the series progressed, critics' opinions became more positive; the production values rated highly and the fantasy scenes, which became <b>a</b> <b>hallmark</b> of Cold Feet, were well received. An average of eight million viewers watched the series each week. The following year it won awards from the Royal Television Society, the Broadcasting Press Guild and the British Comedy Awards. It was also nominated for the Rose d'Or and a Banff Rockie Award. All six episodes have been released on VHS, DVD and internet media formats.|$|E

Hamilton told Llewelyn to inject humour into the character, thus beginning the friendly antagonism between Q and Bond that became <b>a</b> <b>hallmark</b> of the series. He had already {{appeared in the}} previous Bond film From Russia With Love and, {{with the exception of}} Live and Let Die, would continue to play Q in the next 16 Bond films.|$|E

5|$|Fried chicken (also {{referred}} to as Southern fried chicken for the variant in the United States) is a dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or battered and then pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior. What separates fried chicken from other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut at the joints, and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered of excess fat, is <b>a</b> <b>hallmark</b> of well made fried chicken.|$|E
5|$|Improvements in {{education}} were <b>a</b> <b>hallmark</b> of Wetherby's term as governor. Over {{the course of}} his administration, he increased funding to education by $20million. He called for the creation of an educational television network and initiated the state's first publicly funded bookmobile program. He supported the 1954 Minimum Foundation Program, an amendment to the state constitution that allowed funding to be allocated to school districts based upon need rather than number of pupils.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Antillean {{music can}} be {{characterized}} by the prominence of the Carnival celebration (prominently from Trinidad and Tobago), {{and the importance of}} calypso-like song traditions. The Lesser Antilles is also home to a strong Indo-Caribbean population; though Indo-Caribbean music is found elsewhere in the Caribbean, the prominence of Indian-influenced styles is <b>a</b> <b>hallmark</b> of the Antillean music scenes. Regional forms can also be found outside of the Caribbean entirely, most notably in New York City, where Brooklyn's Labor Day Carnival features music and parades, mas and steel bands; this Carnival is distinct to New York, and reflects elements of a pan-Caribbean nature.|$|E

5|$|Sculptural figuration was {{to become}} <b>a</b> <b>hallmark</b> of van der Weyden's mature work, and is best typified by the Madrid Descent, where the {{mourning}} figures are shaped and take on poses more usually seen in sculpture. Erwin Panofsky identified this work and The Madonna Standing as van der Weyden's earliest extant work; they are also his smallest panels. Panofsky dated both panels as 1432â€“34, and believed them to be early works based on stylistic reasons, their near miniature scale, {{and because of the}} evident influences of both Campin and van Eyck.|$|E
5|$|The victim, as {{presented}} by Goya, is as anonymous as his killers. His entreaty is addressed not to God {{in the manner}} of traditional painting, but to an unheeding and impersonal firing squad. He is not granted the heroism of individuality, but is merely part of a continuum of victims. Beneath him lies a bloody and disfigured corpse; behind and around him are others who will soon share the same fate. Here, for the first time, according to biographer Fred Licht, nobility in individual martyrdom is replaced by futility and irrelevance, the victimization of mass murder, and anonymity as <b>a</b> <b>hallmark</b> of the modern condition.|$|E
5|$|When Carey {{tries to}} open up a bit more, her sentiments are the {{equivalent}} of <b>a</b> <b>Hallmark</b> Precious Moments figurine. In a ballad 'Bye Bye', Carey isn't taking chances, designing the lyrics for mass appeal by dedicating them to anyone who ever lost somebody, be it 'your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady'. But Carey gracefully pulls off the universality of the lyrics, and the tune will likely be a massive hit.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>hallmark</b> of the {{curriculum}} in the earliest days was study organized around major themesâ€”trees, Shakespeare, Egypt and other subjectsâ€”that built over the school year into major class projects, performances, and all-school gatherings. Many of these themes and events have grown into lasting school traditions, with which the school community has come to identify each group and certain times of year. One the school's most cherished traditions, tapping maple trees to make syrup, began with the move to the new building in 1929. The Spring Fair, in which groups one through five each prepare and perform their own dance, has been held annually since the 1930sâ€”the Maypole dance by the fifth group {{dates back to the}} beginning of the Cottage School.|$|E
5|$|A {{pioneering}} {{work of the}} fantasy genre was The King of Elfland's Daughter, a 1924 novel by Lord Dunsany. The Elves of Middle-earth {{played a central role}} in Tolkien's legendarium, notably The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings; this legendarium was enormously influential on subsequent fantasy writing. Tolkien's writing had such influence that in the 1960s and afterwards, elves speaking an elvish language similar to those in Tolkien's novels became staple non-human characters in high fantasy works and in fantasy role-playing games. Post-Tolkien fantasy elves (which featured not only in novels but also role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons) are often portrayed as being wiser and more beautiful than humans, with sharper senses and perceptions as well. They are said to be gifted in magic, mentally sharp and lovers of nature, art, and song. They are often skilled archers. <b>A</b> <b>hallmark</b> of many fantasy elves is their pointed ears.|$|E
5|$|Balzac {{began using}} {{characters}} from earlier works in his 1835 novel Le PÃ¨re Goriot, {{and made the}} technique <b>a</b> <b>hallmark</b> of his fiction. In the case of Z. Marcas, the narratorâ€“ Charles Rabourdin, whose identity is only revealed {{at the end of}} the storyâ€“ is in fact the son of a central character from Balzac's 1837 tale La Femme supÃ©rieure. The title character of that story is married to Xavier Rabourdin, who is unjustly ignored for a promotion to the head of his civil service department. At the end of the La Femme supÃ©rieure, Rabourdin pledges to his wife that they will enjoy success in the world of business. His son's poverty in Z. Marcas is evidence of his failure.|$|E
