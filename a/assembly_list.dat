50|$|Peter Naholo is a Namibian {{politician}} and former trade unionist. Naholo was a combatant with the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN), the military {{wing of the}} SWAPO liberation movement. In 2009, he was placed sixth on the National <b>Assembly</b> <b>list</b> for the newly formed Rally for Democracy and Progress and earned {{a seat in the}} National Assembly of Namibia. On 14 September 2010, Naholo and 8 other opposition NA members were sworn in after boycotting the National Assembly due to electoral irregularities in the 2009 general election. On 19 October 2010, Naholo gave his first speech a member of the National Assembly; in that speech, Naholo asserted that some SWAPO politicians had enriched themselves through government since independence before being shouted down and asked to withdraw the accusation by Speaker Theo-Ben Gurirab. Later in the same session, several members of SWAPO accused Naholo and other RDP members of enriching themselves while in government as SWAPO members.|$|E

5000|$|Before the December 1933 race, Zalozetsky-Sas {{took the}} {{eccentric}} measure of aligning his {{party with a}} small contender, the Radical Peasants' Party (PȚR). Also unusually, he was assigned the top position on the PȚR <b>Assembly</b> <b>list</b> for Cernăuți County—although he lost that battle, he won the Senate seat. On March 3, 1934, Zalozetsky-Sas petitioned the king, outlining his key grievances: [...] "persons belonging to the educated classes who are of Ukrainian nationality are unable to find employment; the Ukrainian children cannot obtain instruction in their mother-tongue; Rumanian priests, {{most of whom are}} quite ignorant of Ukrainian, are sent to Ukrainian church parishes." [...] In early 1936, he addressed Parliament with another speech, in which he firmly requested the reintroduction of Ukrainian in schools. In September, he handed his senatorial mandate to Serbyniuk, announcing that he was no longer politically active. However, he failed in his bid to become honorary consul of the Austrian Corporate State, being deemed a [...] "Ukrainian fanatic".|$|E
50|$|Esau {{was born}} in Swakopmund, Erongo Region on 9 December 1957. He earned his matric at St. Josephs Training College in Dobra in 1977 and {{graduated}} from the University of Fort Hare in 1984. Esau rose through the Mineworkers Union of Namibia to become {{secretary general of the}} umbrella National Union of Namibian Workers (NUNW) in 1991. In 1992, during a time of debate concerning the role of Namibia's trade unions, Esau favored maintaining an alliance with SWAPO. However, Esau later in 1994 suggested that the trade unions could form their own political party if workers' rights continued to be ignored by the SWAPO government. In the same year, the Swakopmund native was placed on the National <b>Assembly</b> <b>list</b> for SWAPO and was voted into the National Assembly in elections the next year. Esau {{was a member of the}} politburo of SWAPO from 1991 to 1997 and the Central Committee of the party since 1991. As Deputy Minister, Esau had to support liberal economic policies, including the setting up of export processing zones in Namibia where labour laws do not apply.|$|E
5000|$|Born in Korçë in 1859, {{he spent}} most of his youth in the Albania colony of Bucharest. He became {{chairman}} of the society [...] "Dituria" [...] ("Knowledge") in 1897, and contributed in the establishment of a local [...] "Committee for the Liberation of Albania", one of the many of that time. Evangjeli became prefect of his native city in 1914, after coming back from Romania.As part of the government of Sulejman Delvina he was shortly part of the Albanian delegation in the Paris Peace Conference in 1920. After that he was elected member of the parliament, and shorty Prime Minister from 16 October 1921 to 5 December 1921. From 1922 to 1924 he was Foreign Minister. During Fan Noli's tenure after the June Revolution he exiled in Romania, returning in 1925 when he was elected Head of the Senate. As a representative of Korça, he headed the session which proclaimed Albania as a Constitutional Monarchy and Ahmet Zogu as King of Albania. A strong supporter of Zog, he directed three cabinets as Prime Minister from 1930 to 1935. He was replaced by Mehdi Frashëri after the critics received for [...] "failing to maintain peace and order" [...] during the Revolt of Fier, 1935. He served as Parliamentary President until the Italian invasion of 1939.Although he was considered a pro-Italian, and his name appears in the <b>Assembly</b> <b>list</b> of 1943, he did not play any active role during World War II. The communist regime did not persecute him. Evangjeli died in Korçë in 1949.|$|E

40|$|Building {{information}} modelling {{has proven to}} be an effective tool for both engineering and construction management. It can be used from early conceptual design to detailed design and for creating construction phase models. It is also a practical tool for managing communication and other data between Designers, Constructor, Fabricators and Contractors. This Master’s thesis is a company specific case study and written for localizing potential in more BIM based project management. Main objective of the research is to formulate a sketch of a suitable BIM based installation logistics and project management system focusing on packing management system and packing order. The research has been delimited to pertain steel frame elements of power plant engine hall. In order to achieve the main objective, installation logistics and other construction management related properties of the chosen softwares Tekla Structures and Tekla BIMsight are examined. Main interests of the constructor company concerning construction management and especially installation logistics are also localized. Furthermore, quality standards for modelling and packing process are defined to achieve the main objective. As a result, findings of the research and suggested tools are evaluated based on the needs of the constructor. Tekla Stuctures can be used for conceptual design, for generating drawings and report, and for erection scheduling. In addition, it {{has turned out to be}} practical software for managing frame element delivery and data needed for site management. Organizer found in Tekla Structures especially is a handy tool for managing information needed for coordination of a site and frame element delivery. Tekla BIMsight is software for project collaboration and can be used for combining the models of different project stakeholders and for frame element unloading and installation management. Tekla BIMsight is a practical tool for making assembly plans and progress reports of site installation works. It can also be used for the supervision of installation works, for frame element unloading and grouping, and for on-site collaboration between structural and MEP works. Use of note files compatible to Tekla Structures and Tekla BIMsight enables BIM based communication between Structural Designers, Project Engineers and Site Supervisors throughout the project. The best way to ensure a practical frame element packing order is to attach an installation sequence number pointing out the required packing order for each steel assembly and to publish these numbers in an <b>assembly</b> <b>list.</b> It is also practical to divide an engine hall for modules and phases if needed using the Organizer tool in Tekla Structures, and to utilize this division for managing frame element delivery. Still, for developing installation logistics further, it is recommendable to seek better frame installation management through more integrated BIM based communication protocols...|$|E
