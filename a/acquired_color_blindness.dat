40|$|Abstract- <b>Color</b> <b>blindness</b> is {{deficiency}} of color vision. Due to presence of <b>color</b> <b>blindness,</b> human eye becomes unable to differentiate colors with each other. Generally reason behind <b>color</b> <b>blindness</b> is genetic {{but sometimes it}} happens due to some damage and disorder in brain and eye. <b>Color</b> <b>blindness</b> is of many types like Red-Green, Blue-Yellow etc. Red-Green <b>color</b> <b>blindness</b> is {{most common type of}} deficiency in which person is unable to differentiate between red and green colors.

40|$|Background: Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is {{a disease}} of young and middle aged individuals with a demyelinative axonal damage nature in central nervous system that causes various signs and symptoms. As color vision needs normal function of optic nerve and macula, it is proposed that MS can alter it via influencing optic nerve. In this survey, we evaluated color vision abnormalities and its relationship with history of optic neuritis and abnormal visual evoked potentials (VEPs) among MS patients. Materials and Methods: The case group was included of clinically definitive MS patients and {{the same number of}} normal population was enrolled as the control group. Color vision of all the participants was evaluated by Ishihara test and then visual evoked potential (VEPs) and history of optic neuritis (ON) was assessed among them. Then, frequency of <b>color</b> <b>blindness</b> was compared between the case and the control group. Finally, color blinded patients were compared to those with the history of ON and abnormal VEPs. Results: 63 MS patients and the same number of normal populations were enrolled in this study. 12 patients had <b>color</b> <b>blindness</b> based on the Ishihara test; only 3 of them were among the control group, which showed a significant different between the two groups (P = 0. 013). There was a significant relationship between the <b>color</b> <b>blindness</b> and abnormal VEP (R = 0. 53, P = 0. 023) but not for the <b>color</b> <b>blindness</b> and ON (P = 0. 67). Conclusions: This study demonstrates a significant correlation between <b>color</b> <b>blindness</b> and multiple sclerosis including ones with abnormal prolonged VEP latencies. Therefore, in individuals with <b>acquired</b> <b>color</b> vision impairment, an evaluation for potentially serious underlying diseases like MS is essential...|$|R
5000|$|Red-green <b>color</b> <b>blindness</b> is {{the most}} common form, {{followed}} by blue-yellow <b>color</b> <b>blindness</b> and total <b>color</b> <b>blindness.</b> Red-green <b>color</b> <b>blindness</b> affects up to 8% of males and 0.5% of females of Northern European descent. The ability to see color also decreases in old age. Being color blind may make people ineligible for certain jobs in certain countries. This may include pilot, train driver, and armed forces.

50|$|Based on {{clinical}} appearance, <b>color</b> <b>blindness</b> may {{be described as}} total or partial. Total <b>color</b> <b>blindness</b> is much less common than partial <b>color</b> <b>blindness.</b> There are two major types of color blindness: those who have difficulty distinguishing between red and green, and who have difficulty distinguishing between blue and yellow.|$|R
50|$|<b>Color</b> <b>blindness,</b> {{also known}} as color vision deficiency, is the {{decreased}} ability to see color or differences in <b>color.</b> <b>Color</b> <b>blindness</b> can make some educational activities difficult. Buying fruit, picking clothing, and reading traffic lights can be more challenging, for example. Problems, however, are generally minor and most people adapt. People with total <b>color</b> <b>blindness,</b> however, may also have decreased visual acuity and be uncomfortable in bright environments.|$|R
25|$|Ladd-Franklin {{concluded}} that color vision evolved in three stages: achromatic vision (black and white), blue-yellow sensitivity and red-green sensitivity.

5000|$|<b>Color</b> <b>blindness</b> or <b>color</b> vision {{deficiency}} is {{the inability}} or decreased {{ability to see}} color, or perceive color differences, under normal lighting conditions. <b>Color</b> <b>blindness</b> affects many individuals in the population. There is no actual blindness, {{but there is a}} deficiency of color vision. The most usual cause is a fault in the development of one or more sets of retinal cones that perceive color in light and transmit that information to the optic nerve. This type of <b>color</b> <b>blindness</b> is usually a sex-linked condition. The genes that produce photopigments are carried on the X chromosome; if some of these genes are missing or damaged, <b>color</b> <b>blindness</b> will be expressed in males with a higher probability than in females because males only have one X chromosome.|$|R
40|$|Due to its {{emphasis}} on diminishing race and avoiding racial discourse, color blind racial ideology has repeatedly been suggested to have negative consequences for modern day race relations. The current research examined the influence of <b>color</b> <b>blindness,</b> {{as well as the}} level of ambiguity of a prejudiced remark, on perceptions of a target confrontation. One hundred thirteen White participants read and responded to a scene depicting a White character committing a racial verbal microaggression of variable ambiguity, after which a target character confronted the comment. Results showed that the target confronter was perceived more negatively and her confrontation was less supported by participants with high <b>color</b> <b>blindness,</b> measured by Neville and colleagues' (2001) Color Blind Racial Attitudes Scale. Furthermore, participants with high <b>color</b> <b>blindness</b> tended to rate the White commenter less negatively than those with low <b>color</b> <b>blindness.</b> In addition, participants were affected by the microaggression's ambiguity regardless of <b>color</b> <b>blindness,</b> with a higher level of ambiguity predicting more negative perceptions of the Black confronter and the confrontation. Implications for how <b>color</b> <b>blindness,</b> as an accepted norm among White Americans that is endorsed across legal and educational settings, and insensitivity to ambiguous prejudice can facilitate Whites' complicity in racial inequality are discussed...|$|R

5000|$|As {{a way to}} {{introduce}} new genetic information to change a person’s phenotype, a gene therapy for <b>color</b> <b>blindness</b> {{is open to the}} same ethical questions and criticisms as gene therapy in general.

5000|$|The {{different}} kinds of inherited <b>color</b> <b>blindness</b> result from partial or complete loss of function {{of one or more}} of the different cone systems. When one cone system is compromised, dichromacy results. The most frequent forms of human <b>color</b> <b>blindness</b> result from problems with either the middle or long wavelength sensitive cone systems, and involve difficulties in discriminating reds, yellows, and greens from one another. They are collectively referred to as [...] "red-green color blindness", though the term is an over-simplification and is somewhat misleading. Other forms of <b>color</b> <b>blindness</b> are much more rare. They include problems in discriminating blues from greens and yellows from reds/pinks, and the rarest forms of all, complete <b>color</b> <b>blindness</b> or monochromacy, where one cannot distinguish any color from grey, as in a black-and-white movie or photograph.|$|R
