500|$|In the 1996–97 season, Wetherall played less {{regularly}} as {{new manager}} George Graham experimented with defensive combinations, though {{by the following}} season he had re-established himself in the starting eleven, sometimes acting as captain, and signed a new five-year contract. On 27 September 1997, he scored in the 1–0 victory over arch-rivals Manchester United when Roy Keane's knee was badly injured {{in the act of}} fouling Alf-Inge Håland, who then accused Keane of feigning injury. Keane later took revenge on Håland during a Manchester derby and said to Håland as he lay on the ground: [...] "And don't ever stand over me again sneering about fake injuries, <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>your</b> pal Wetherall there's some for him as well." [...] Later that season Wetherall was among the Leeds travelling party who escaped unhurt as their aircraft crash-landed after an engine caught fire on takeoff.|$|E
500|$|... "Picture to Burn" [...] {{received}} critical acclaim. [...] Chris Neal of Country Weekly believed [...] "Picture to Burn", {{along with}} [...] "Should've Said No", {{were the most}} immediately striking songs on Taylor Swift. Jack Lowe of About.com said the song was fun, and that females would specially enjoy it. Kate Kiefer of Paste magazine selected the track as one of Swift's six best singles, and stated, [...] "She really shows her age in this one". Roger Holland of PopMatters commented that the song was the epitome of how, according to him, Swift was more given in uptempo tempos, and that it served as indication {{to the nature of}} Swift's debut album. Holland added, [...] "'Picture to Burn' is two parts Ashlee Simpson to one part Amy Dalley, with an overly familiar guitar melody that could have been lifted directly from the latter." [...] Top music critic Robert Christgau selected [...] "Picture to Burn" [...] as a highlight on Taylor Swift. Josh Love of The Village Voice attributed the song {{to be one of the}} reasons how the singer rose to stardom. He called it a [...] "bluntly relatable composition [...] that connected [...] with teens from across the spectrum." [...] Patrick McDonald of The Seattle Times called it a [...] "clever, sassy, upbeat song" [...] Alison Bonaguro of the Chicago Tribune said the song was a [...] "clean-but-still-rowdy" [...] number for Swift. Kevin Courtney of The Irish Times mentioned [...] "Picture to Burn" [...] among powerful revenge songs and noted the lyric [...] "Go <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>your</b> friends that I'm obsessive and crazy / That's fine / I'll tell mine you're gay." [...] He supported the sentiment behind the song and wrote, [...] "You go girl".|$|E
2500|$|The {{incident}} that gave {{its name to}} the war had occurred in 1731, off the coast of Florida, when the British brig Rebecca was boarded by the Spanish patrol boat La Isabela, commanded by the guarda costa (effectively privateer) Juan de León Fandiño. After boarding, Fandiño cut off the left ear of the Rebeccas captain, Robert Jenkins, whom he accused of smuggling (although Franklin’s Pennsylvania Gazette for October 7, 1731, says it was Lieutenant Dorce). Fandiño told Jenkins, [...] "Go, <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>your</b> King that I will do the same, if he dares to do the same." [...] In March 1738, Jenkins was ordered to testify before Parliament, presumably to repeat his story before a committee of the House of Commons. According to some accounts, he produced the severed ear as part of his presentation, although no detailed record of the hearing exists. The incident was considered alongside various other cases of [...] "Spanish Depredations upon the British Subjects", and was perceived as an insult to Britain's honour and a clear casus belli.|$|E

2500|$|At 6:30am on 27 August Joffre sent Lanrezac {{an urgent}} message {{reminding}} {{him of his}} promise to counterattack. This angered Lanrezac, who spent the day—both on the telephone to GQG and in conversation with Lt-Col Alexandre of GQG, who had visited him at his HQ at Marle twice—arguing against the order, and he again demanded to be permitted to fall back {{when he learned that}} the BEF intended to retreat again on 28 August. After a tense discussion Lanrezac agreed to attack from Guise rather than first retreat further to Laon, and as soon as his forces were on open ground where they could use their artillery—which Lanrezac had told Joffre was the key factor—and to take no account of what the British on his left were doing. At 8:10pm on 27 August Joffre ordered him to relieve the British by attacking west rather than northwest. Lanrezac objected strenuously, reluctant to undertake a 90-degree turn in the face of enemy forces. Lanrezac sent Lt-Col Alexandre back with the words “before trying to teach me my business, sir, go back <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>your</b> little strategists to learn their own.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Soon after that, Changing Woman {{wished for}} a mate. Every {{morning when the}} sun rose she {{lay on her back}} until noon, her head to the west and her feet to the east. [...] At noon she went to the spring. She lay under the ledge and let spring water drip over her body. This took place each day for four days. On the fourth day, she heard a sound behind her and turned and saw a young man on a great white horse with black eyes. It had a long white mane, and pranced above the ground and not on the earth itself. The bridle and the saddle were white. The young man's moccasins and {{leggings}} were also white. The rider spoke: [...] "You lay towards me each morning until noon. When I am half over the center of the earth, you go to the spring. Your wish could not have two meanings. Go home <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>your</b> father to build a brush hogan to the south of your home. Fill a basket with meal and set it in the hogan. Make a line of pollen from east to west across the basket on top of the meal. Make a line of pollen from north to south drawn around the basket. You and your father must sit there late into the night. He will then go home to his wife and you must stay there alone." ...|$|E
