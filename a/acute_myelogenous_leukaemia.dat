40|$|In {{a variety}} of adult and {{childhood}} leukaemia cell samples collected at different states of the disease, we analysed {{in a series of}} sequentially performed slot-blot or Northern-blot hybridisation experiments the expression of genes possibly involved in multiple drug resistance (MDR) (mdr 1 /P-glycoprotein, DNA topoisomerase II, glutathione-S-transferase pi), and the expression of the DNA topoisomerase I and histone 3. 1 genes. Occasionally, P-glycoprotein gene expression was additionally examined by indirect immunocytofluorescence using the monoclonal antibody C 219. No significant difference in mdr 1 /P-glycoprotein mRNA levels between primary and relapsed state acute lymphocytic leukaemias (ALL) was seen on average. Second or third relapses, however, showed a distinct tendency to an elevated expression of this multidrug transporter gene (up to 10 -fold) in part well beyond the value seen in the moderately cross-resistant T-lymphoblastoid CCRF-CEM subline CCRF VCR 100. Increased mdr 1 /P-glycoprotein mRNA levels were also found in relapsed state <b>acute</b> <b>myelogenous</b> <b>leukaemias</b> (AML), and in chronic lymphocytic leukaemias (CLL) treated with chlorambucil and/or prednisone for several years. Topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II mRNA levels were found to be very variable. Whereas in all but one case of CLL topoisomerase II mRNA was not detected by slot-blot hybridizations, strong topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II gene expression levels, frequently exceeding the levels monitored in the CCRF-CEM cell line, were seen in many cell samples of acute leukaemia. If topoisomerase II mRNA was undetectable, expression of topoisomerase I was clearly visible throughout. These observations might be valuable considering the possible treatment with specific topoisomerase I or topoisomerase II inhibitors. Significant positive correlations were found (i) for topoisomerase I and histone 3. 1 gene expression levels in general (P less than 0. 001), and (ii) in the CLL samples additionally for the expression levels of the mdr 1 gene, and the histone 3. 1, topoisomerase I, and glutathione-S-transferase pi genes, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Background: Myeloid sarcoma (MS) {{is a solid}} {{malignant}} tumour associated with infiltration of immature myeloid precursor cells in an extramedullary site. The term MS has replaced the term granulocytic sarcoma and chloroma, which {{were used in the}} past. MS in the oral cavity is very uncommon, with less of 40 cases reported until recently. Case Report: We report the first case, the features, and the diagnostic sequence, of intraoral MS with bilateral palatal involvement, which presented as an initial manifestation, and preceded the appearance of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Diagnostic confirmation of such oral mucosal lesions usually requires biopsy, histopathological examination with additional immunohistochemical investigation.

The periodic acid-Schiff stain was of little value in differentiating the 3 groups. The treatment response in each group was different: 94 o / of {{patients with}} ALL (16 / 17) achieved complete remission with prednisone, vincristine and other drugs in standard use in childhood ALL; 590 ° of patients with AML (27 / 46) achieved complete remission with cytosine arabinoside and daunorubicin (22 patients), or 6 -thioguanine and cyclophosphamide (2 patients), 6 -thioguanine, cyclophosphamide and Adriamycin (1 patient), and cytosine and Adriamycin (1 patient); only 2 out of 14 patients (14 °/) with acute undifferentiated leukaemia achieved complete remission using cytosine and daunorubicin after an initial trial of prednisone and vincristine had failed. Prednisone and vincristine {{would seem to be}} of no value in acute undifferentiated leukaemia. It would seem also that no benefit is obtained by classifying all patients with acute leukaemia over 20 years of age as " adult acute leukaemia " and treating them with the same polypharmaceutical regimen.

Further, primary cells of untreated chronic <b>myelogenous</b> <b>leukaemia</b> patients were assayed for colony forming ability under combination therapy with imatinib.

As a result, significantly low lactoferrin-scores were frequently observed in acute leukaemias and the acute phase of chronic leukaemias.
