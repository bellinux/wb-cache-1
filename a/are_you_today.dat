2500|$|Her {{last years}} {{were marked by}} pain and sickness. She used a wheelchair, but she {{retained}} her cheerfulness, and if asked how she was, she would always smile and answer: [...] "As the Master desires." [...] In the extremity of her last hours her mind was driven back to the years of her slavery and she cried out: [...] "The chains are too tight, loosen them a little, please!" [...] After a while she came round again. Someone asked her: [...] "How <b>are</b> <b>you?</b> <b>Today</b> is Saturday." [...] "Yes, I am so happy: Our Lady... Our Lady!" [...] These were her last audible words.|$|E
2500|$|MacIsaac's album Hi™ How <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> <b>Today?,</b> {{featuring}} the hit single [...] "Sleepy Maggie", with vocals in Scottish Gaelic by Mary Jane Lamond {{was released in}} 1995.

Moorehead {{recalled}} her first public performance was at the age of three, reciting The Lord's Prayer in her father's church. The family moved to St. Louis, Missouri, and Moorehead's ambition to become an actress grew [...] "very strong". Her mother indulged her active imagination, often asking, [...] "Who <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>today,</b> Agnes?", while Moorehead and her sister would often engage in mimicry, often coming to the dinner table and imitating parishioners. Moorehead noted and was encouraged by her father's amused reactions. She joined the chorus of the St. Louis Municipal Opera Company, known as [...] "The Muny". In addition to her interest in acting, she developed a lifelong interest in religion; in later years, actors such as Dick Sargent would recall Moorehead's arriving on the set with [...] "the Bible in one hand and the script in the other".|$|E
