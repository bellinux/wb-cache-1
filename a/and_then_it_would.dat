5|$|As {{originally}} {{proposed in}} 1925, the line's junction with the IND Crosstown Line in Long Island City {{would have been}} a T-junction, allowing trains from Manhattan to travel south to Brooklyn via the Crosstown line. A map from June of that year shows a proposed alternate routing for the Queens Boulevard Line, that would have had the line turn via Kew Gardens Road after the Union Turnpike station instead of continuing via Queens Boulevard. After proceeding via Kew Gardens Road the line would have turned via Hillside Avenue. The map also shows a two-track line continuing from the Van Wyck Boulevard station to 94th Avenue (Atlantic Avenue) in Richmond Hill via Van Wyck Boulevard (today's Van Wyck Expressway). During construction only bellmouths were built for the line, however they were eventually used for the IND Archer Avenue Line. As documented by the map, the Queens Boulevard Line, as originally planned, would have had the express trains travel on a more direct route, via Broadway and Queens Boulevard, while the local trains would take a less direct route hitting larger population centers. There were to be two such instances, however only one was actually completed. The first one, which was not constructed, would have gone through Winfield (now Woodside), west of the existing Elmhurst Avenue station, and the local tracks would have diverged, continuing via Queens Broadway before turning onto 69th Street (Fisk Avenue), rejoining the express tracks at Broadway in Woodside. The second instance, the one that was built, was planned to have the local tracks continue via Broadway west of the 65th Street station, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> turn south via Steinway Street before rejoining the express tracks at the 36th Street station. The express tracks here would take the more direct route, via Northern Boulevard.|$|E
25|$|UNICA, a Brazilian ethanol {{producers}} association, {{welcomed the}} ruling and commented {{that they hope}} the classification of Brazilian sugarcane ethanol as an advanced biofuel will contribute to influence {{those who seek to}} lift the trade barriers imposed against clean energy, both in the U.S. {{and the rest of the}} world. EPA's final ruling is expected to benefit Brazilian producers, as the blending mandate requires an increasing quota of advanced biofuels, which is not likely to be fulfill with cellulosic ethanol, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> force blenders to import more Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, despite the existing 54¢ per gallon tariff on ethanol imported directly from Brazil.|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} Just Dance {{led to the}} {{development}} of a sequel, Just Dance 2, which focused on adding new features and refinements to the game—such as improvements to its motion tracking system, new game modes, and support for downloadable content. Sales of Just Dance 2 surpassed that of the original; with over 5 million copies as of January 2011, it was the best-selling third-party title for the Wii. Laurent Detoc, CEO of Ubisoft's North American operations, stated that this achievement [...] " [...] the Just Dance brand as a pop culture phenomenon." [...] Poix felt that [...] "there's a pressure within Ubisoft to keep Just Dance enormous, and we think we can make it enormous. But it wasn't like that initially, because at the end of the first one, people—even us—had our doubts that it would last. After the first one we thought maybe there would be a second one, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And another pond for {{the healthy}} folk," [...] {{suggested}} Captain Arkal; [...] "we {{like to give}} ourselves a wash now <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> never do for the healthy to go spluttering about with the sick--would it?" ...|$|R

2500|$|... "Theseus", {{created in}} 1950, was a {{magnetic}} mouse controlled by an electromechanical relay circuit that enabled it {{to move around}} a labyrinth of 25 squares. Its dimensions {{were the same as}} those of an average mouse. The maze configuration was flexible and it could be modified arbitrarily by rearranging movable partitions. The mouse was designed to search through the corridors until it found the target. Having travelled through the maze, the mouse could then be placed anywhere it had been before, and because of its prior experience it could go directly to the target. If placed in unfamiliar territory, it was programmed to search until it reached a known location <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> proceed to the target, adding the new knowledge to its memory and learning new behavior. Shannon's mouse appears to have been the first artificial learning device of its kind.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{method of}} hanging was [...] "hoisting" [...] {{in which a}} rope would be thrown over a beam and the convicted person would then be hoisted into the air by others pulling on the rope. The slip knot would then tightly close around the neck until strangulation. A {{variation}} of this included the person with a rope around the neck to stand on a cart <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be pushed from under him. This {{led to the development}} of suspension in which [...] "the drop" [...] caused by jerking something from underneath the offender became the main component of the execution. Executioners experimented with the length of the rope for the drop. They discovered new ways of causing instant unconsciousness and quick death upon hanging. In 1872, the length of a drop extended to nearly five feet which dislocated the neck perfectly. Almost one year later, the length of the drop was extended to seven feet.|$|E
2500|$|Indian Larry {{built the}} Chain of Mystery bike during this final challenge. [...] Larry {{said that the}} {{original}} idea for the bike's frame came {{to him in a}} flash of inspiration. [...] He explained that his most creative ideas for a new build would flash across his mind {{in the form of an}} image, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be his job to relentlessly chase that vision during a build until the image materialized in the finished product. [...] Chain of Mystery utilized a frame concept that had never been done before. Using a jig as a guide, the heavy links of a chain, normally used for towing heavy vehicles, were welded together until the frame took shape (the shop's Eddie Mcgarry was the project welder). Since the frame is essentially the spine of the bike, any weaknesses in the welds could prove fatal, especially considering that Larry really pushed his bikes to perform when riding them. [...] As it turned out, the bike held up, and Larry rode the chopper to what would be his final bike show.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What! {{that a man}} {{killed three}} hundred men with the jawbone of an ass? It couldn't have been; it was sheer impossible,--unless they were all asleep, <b>and</b> even <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be an awful job.' ...|$|R
60|$|Gonzaga left him. Francesco {{would not}} make his rounds for another hour, <b>and</b> by <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not matter what Fortemani told him. In {{one way or another}} {{he would be able to}} account for his action.|$|R
6000|$|... "From {{a learned}} wizard," [...] said he; <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> {{thinking}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> interest her, he told {{how he had}} made the glass dog for the wizard, and how it barked and kept everybody from bothering him.|$|R
2500|$|Following the {{resignation}} of Liverpool manager George Kay in January 1951 due to health reasons, Hodgson was among the hopefuls who were interviewed for the manager's job at Anfield. [...] Don Welsh was eventually appointed, while Hodgson was admitted to hospital {{a couple of months}} later but his [...] "throat complaint" [...] was deemed inoperable. [...] He returned to his home in Burslem after a month in hospital and a few days later, with a promising managerial career still in its infancy, he died of cancer on 14 June 1951, at the age of just 47. [...] Port Vale legend Roy Sproson had Hodgson as his first boss: [...] "Gordon Hodgson was a fair chap. [...] He would give you a rollicking one minute <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be forgotten. [...] Everybody liked him and his loss was so sad." [...] His benefit match was held against Port Vale's local rivals Stoke City on 1 October 1951, Vale lost the game 2–1. [...] £383 was raised for his dependants.|$|E
2500|$|In 1861, at the {{beginning}} of American Civil War, she procured the advance sheets, in French, of Agénor de Gasparin's [...] "Uprising of a Great People," [...] and hurried to Scribner's with it to ask if they would publish it if she would translate it. She was told that it would be valuable if it could be issued immediately, but that the war would not last more than a month, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not be so interesting. Booth took the book home with her. By working 20 hours a day, she translated the whole book in less than a week, and it was published in a fortnight. The book created a great sensation among Northerners, and both Charles Sumner and President Lincoln wrote her letters of thanks. But though Sumner wrote her that what she had done was [...] "worth a whole phalanx in the cause of human freedom," [...] again she received but little pecuniary compensation. While the war lasted, however, she translated many French books calculated to rouse patriotic feeling, and was, at one time, summoned to Washington to write for the men whose work for their country she considered it a privilege to help, receiving only her board at a hotel. She was able at this time to procure for her father the position of clerk in the New York Custom House, and so relieve him from the very wearing night work he had been doing.|$|E

6000|$|Perhaps [...] "afraid" [...] {{would be}} a better word, for some {{instinct}} seemed to warn Ayesha that soon or late her hour would come to Atene again, <b>and</b> that <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be her own turn to drink of the bitter waters of despair.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very little--as I know; but if evil {{men were}} not now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> slain <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{not be a}} good world for weaponless dreamers. I do not speak without {{knowledge}} who have seen the land from Delhi south awash with blood.' ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{group was}} founded in 2000 by {{producer}} KayGee from Naughty by Nature, who recruited Elizabeth [...] "Yummy" [...] Bingham, Shaquana [...] "Quana" [...] Elam and Tina [...] "Tina-J" [...] Jenkins.

5000|$|Melody Maker (5/25/96, p. 49) - [...] "It {{makes my}} brain hurt, my eyes water and my {{genitalia}} retract like a startled turtle. I cannot think of higher recommendation, considering {{the kind of}} album it is.

6000|$|... 'No, I {{was afraid}} she would, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been all over with us; but I dragged her safe into the school-room, {{and there she was}} so hysterical that I nearly relented.' ...|$|E

60|$|The others forgot {{their lines}} in {{watching}} Giant. Up came {{the line for}} fifty feet, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> out <b>it</b> <b>would</b> rush.

60|$|Philip {{had felt}} very desirous, before setting out upon his great {{expedition}} into Asia, to become reconciled to Alexander and Olympias. He wished for Alexander's co-operation in his plans; <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> besides, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{be dangerous to}} go away from his own dominions with such a son left behind, {{in a state of}} resentment and hostility.|$|R
5000|$|The song [...] "Ballad of the Sad Young Men" [...] {{would be}} later {{recorded}} by Petula Clark <b>and</b> <b>then</b> Roberta Flack. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> be popular among gay bars.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That {{will not}} be pleasure-hunting, certainly,' said Amy; then, remembering {{that he could not}} bear to hear Philip under-rated, she added, 'I mean, unless you could {{convince}} him, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be more than pleasure.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't {{know much}} about those old haunts," [...] Ransom rejoined. [...] "I reckon this {{is good enough for}} me. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have had the {{advantage}} that your residence isn't far, you know." ...|$|E

30|$|T 5 {{said that}} {{explaining}} Chinese grammar through ELF {{was playing a}} pedagogical role. Similarly, T 10 used English to translate new terms and phrases. T 15, 16 and 17 used English to introduce Chinese cultural items, such as fengshui, Chinese lucky and unlucky numbers, and the basic strokes of Chinese characters. T 23 mentioned that even advanced students may need translations or interpretations now <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> thus <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be an advantage for CFL teachers {{to be able to}} understand English well and be prepared to use English in their daily teaching practice.|$|R
