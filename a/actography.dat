SourceDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Medical Center Parma, Italy. titosilvio. patrelli@gmail. com Abstract PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION: To evaluate {{the correlation between}} fetal movement revealed in cardiotocography and fetal-neonatal well-being {{as well as to}} assess the value of cardiotocography in our clinical practice. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 3, 805 pregnancies followed at Parma General Hospital. Exclusion criteria were cesarean section, preterm delivery, and stillbirth. We analyzed the predictive power of <b>actography</b> during the dilating and expulsive phases of labor by establishing a correlation between number of fetal movements and our neonatal indexes of well being, i. e., cardiotocographic score, Apgar index and neonatal pH value. Statistical tests used were Fisher's test, chi-square test (X 2), Pearson correlation and Spearman Rho; p value was considered significant if it was less than 0. 05. RESULTS: We considered 2, 389 vaginal deliveries. Analyzing the correlation between fetal movement and cardiotocographic score in the two different phases of labor, the comparison among subpopulations identified by different cardiotocograph scores revealed no statistical difference. CONCLUSION: Cardiotocography is reconfirmed as a good instrument to evaluate neonatal outcome, while actigraphy cannot be used alone to define fetal well-being, mainly due to the inability to standardize assessment of the actographic study...|$|E
40|$|Employing {{a highly}} {{sensitive}} infra-red light <b>actography</b> system, circatidal rhythms of vertical migration {{were recorded in}} first stage zoea larvae of the common shore crab Carcinus maenas (L.), freshly collected from coastal waters. The rhythms persisted in constant conditions in the laboratory for several days, ascent occurring at the times of expected ebb tides at collection sites, and descent during expected flood tides. Timing was identical in larvae sampled at different stage of spring/neap cycle and from sites where different hydrodynamic conditions prevail. These experiments, supported by repeated surface plankton samples which confirmed that zoea- 1 larvae of C. maenas were most abundant at the surface during ebb tides, suggest that the vertical migration behaviour might be linked with avoidance of stranding and offshore dispersal of newly released larvae. The fact that tidal migration rhythm was exhibited by larvae collected from different sites implies that the behaviour is probably widespread for the species. So far, endogenous tidal rhythms of vertical migration in plankton have been demonstrated solely in a few estuarine forms, and have been interpreted only as estuarine retention or reinvasion mechanisms. Present results {{appear to be the}} first to demonstrate that endogenous tidal rhythms also exist in the planktonic larvae of a coastal invertebrate and suggest that these larvae may have an adaptive mechanism to avoid stranding and enhance offshore dispersal in the open sea...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that newly {{released}} zoea larvae of the shore crab Carcinus maenas (L.) exhibit ebb-phased tidal vertical migration rhythms of upward swimming associated with transport offshore in ebb tidal flows. This gives rise to the question as to how later larvae of the species return to the intertidal zone. Repeated surface plankton sampling in coastal waters revealed that megalopae, the last larval stage of the crab, swarmed in surface waters mainly during flood tides and particularly at night. It is likely that flood-phased upward swimming ensures onshore transport of the larvae. Employing an infra-red <b>actography</b> system, endogenous circatidal rhythms of swimming activity were detected in constant laboratory conditions in freshly collected megalopae from inshore waters. However, in such conditions, upward swimming occurred at the times of expected ebb, not flood. It is proposed that inshore flood transport of megalopae is driven primarily by exogenous factors, which result in swarming of pre-moult megalopae towards the upper intertidal zone where settlement of first stage juvenile crabs occurs. It is suggested that the ebb-phased endogenous circatidal rhythm of upward swimming is adaptive in reducing the risk of premature stranding of megalopae, permitting them to oscillate between the intertidal and near shore waters until moulting is imminent and a suitable substratum is encountered. Of megalopae collected in inshore coastal waters, and maintained in the laboratory at water temperatures close to those of the field, nearly 60 % moulted in 2 d, 95 % in 4 d and 100 % in 7 d after collection. Since the average development time for C. maenas megalopae is reported to be 13 d, the data provide evidence that only late megalopae return to coastal areas...|$|E
40|$|Sleep-disordered {{breathing}} (SDB) substantially impairs {{quality of}} life in a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and promote the addition of serious respiratory and cardiovascular complications. Objective: to identify the early signs of SDB in patients with various onset ALS using a comprehensive sleep assessment. Patients and methods. A questionnaire survey using a comprehensive test for sleep disorders was conducted in 65 patients: 39 of them had ALS (male:female ratio, 25 : 14; age, 59 [51; 66] years) and 26 patients made up a control group (male:female ratio, 13 : 13; age, 54 [43; 59] years). The questionnaire consists of 50 questions; the results were expressed as scores. Screening portable polysomnographic study was conducted in patients with newly diagnosed ALS at the relatively early stages of the disease. A total of 61 patients (32 women and 29 men; median (Me and the 25 th and 75 th percentile) age was 62 [55; 67] years) were examined. The disease duration was 12 [8. 9, 27. 1] months after the onset of the first symptoms. The body mass index was 25. 7 [23. 3, 28. 7] kg/m 2. In the study group, ALSFRSR [9] scores at study inclusion were 34. 32 [32; 38]. Cervicothoracic onset ALS was present in 23 patients; 26 and 12 patients had bulbar and lumbosacral onsets, respectively. Screening diagnosis of sleep was carried out using a Polymate YH- 1000 C portable polysomnograph (BMC, China) that registered nasopharyngeal flow (airflow through the nasal and oral cavities); thoracoabdominal movements (movements of the thoracic and abdominal walls); hemoglobin oxygen saturation of arterial blood (SpO 2); a snore sound through the microphone; and sleeping position (<b>actography).</b> Results. The comprehensive screening study of breathing during sleep shows the underestimation of the complaints and symptoms of subclinical respiratory disorders in patients with ALS. Portable pulse oximetry at {{the early stages of the}} disease revealed changes in the nocturnal respiratory parameters that indicated a predisposition to the development of hypoventilation syndrome. Bulbar-onset ALS patients who had significantly higher apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) and oxygen desaturation (ODI) and lower mean SpO 2 with the development of hypoventilation syndrome and, to a lesser extent, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome were most vulnerable to the development of SDB. A correlation analysis revealed the impact of minimal SpO 2, ODI, and apnea duration on cardiorespiratory parameters in ALS patients and the possibility of their use as markers to analyze of SDB and cardiac arrhythmias during screening studies in these patients. Conclusion. The early detection and correction of respiratory failure symptoms can prolong patients' life and improve its quality. The screening study of nocturnal sleep and SDB in patients with ALS is a simple and informative method to evaluate a range of respiratory disorders, especially at the early stages of the disease. </p...|$|E
