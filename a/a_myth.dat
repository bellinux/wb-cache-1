5|$|Jock's main {{rival in}} the show ring was a dog named Tartar, who {{was said to be}} more fond of ratting than his competitor. Jock was said to have never killed a rat; his ability to hunt Foxes was also thought to be <b>a</b> <b>myth.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kriegseisen also {{remarks that}} there is <b>a</b> <b>myth</b> about the {{uniqueness}} of sejmiks to Poland, and notes that similar institutions of self-governance and regional parliamentary participation by nobility {{can be found in}} other places, such as in Hungary and various German provinces (Silesia, Prussia, Brandenburg).|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>myth</b> {{which is}} trait-based, though genetically impossible, {{is the idea}} that the modern Maine Coon descended from {{ancestors}} of semi-feral domestic cats and raccoons. This myth is likely based on the common color of the breed (brown tabby) and its bushy tail. Another idea is that the Maine Coon originated from the matings of domestic cats and wild bobcats, which could explain the tufts of hair that are so commonly seen on the tips of the ears.|$|E
5|$|It is {{generally}} {{believed that the}} propaganda of the Goan priests and the alliance of the Christians with the English cause Tipu to banish the community from Canara. The main political reason for this decision was Tipu's belief that if he banished the Christians, he could keep the British at bay. However, Alan Machado Prabhu dismisses the idea of large-scale Christian support for the British during the Second Mangalore War as <b>a</b> <b>myth</b> which {{is not based on}} any concrete evidence.|$|E
5|$|Many {{writers in}} the early 20th century perpetuated <b>a</b> <b>myth</b> that Thespis ran only a month and was {{considered}} a failure. In fact, it remained open until 8 March. Of the nine London pantomimes that appeared during the 1871–72 holiday season, five closed before Thespis did. By its nature, the genre did not lend itself to long runs, and all nine had closed {{by the end of}} March. Moreover, the Gaiety normally only ran productions for two or three weeks; the run of Thespis was extraordinary for the theatre.|$|E
50|$|The Walam Olum {{includes}} <b>a</b> creation <b>myth,</b> <b>a</b> deluge <b>myth,</b> and {{the narrative}} {{of a series of}} migrations. Rafinesque and others claimed or interpreted the migrations to have begun in Asia. The Walam Olum suggested a migration over the Bering Strait took place 3,600 years ago.|$|R
25|$|Another hero myth is the Cheonjiwang Bonpuli myth. The protagonist, Daebyeol, shoots {{down the}} sun and the moon, {{destroying}} it. However, the Cheonjiwang Bonpuli is more of <b>a</b> creation <b>myth</b> than <b>a</b> hero <b>myth.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the eyes}}, constantly, {{the eyes are}} flaring with little...stories, little forms and shapes, {{some of which are}} quite disturbing, like the swastika...The little myth that's made up of bits and pieces of painted things onto a piece of film that’s called <b>an</b> Eye <b>Myth.</b> In other words, it’s not <b>a</b> word myth; <b>myth</b> means mouth, actually...but <b>an</b> Eye <b>Myth</b> is kind of beautifully oxymoronic.|$|R
5|$|Several urban legends exist {{regarding}} the chariot sequence. One claims that a stuntman died during filming, which Nosher Powell claims in his autobiography, and another states that a red Ferrari {{can be seen}} during the chariot race. The book Movie Mistakes claims this is <b>a</b> <b>myth.</b> Heston, in a DVD commentary track for the film, mentions that a third urban legend claims that he wore a wristwatch during the chariot race, but points out that he wore leather bracers up to the elbow.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{connect the}} Chalukyas with the Chaulukyas (Solankis) of Gujarat. According to <b>a</b> <b>myth</b> mentioned in latter manuscripts of Prithviraj Raso, Chaulukyas were {{born out of}} fire-pit (Agnikund) at Mount Abu. However {{it has been reported}} that the story of Agnikula is not mentioned at all in the original version of the Prithviraj Raso preserved in the Fort Library at Bikaner.|$|E
5|$|The Christ myth {{theory is}} the {{hypothesis}} that Jesus of Nazareth never existed; or if he did, that he had virtually {{nothing to do with}} the founding of Christianity and the accounts in the gospels. Stories of Jesus' birth, along with other key events, have so many mythic elements that some scholars have suggested that Jesus himself was <b>a</b> <b>myth.</b>|$|E
60|$|BIRD-GODS. Apparently Aristophanes preserved, in a burlesque form, the {{remnants}} of <b>a</b> genuine <b>myth.</b> Almost all savage religions have their bird-gods, and {{it is probable that}} Aristophanes did not invent, but only used <b>a</b> surviving <b>myth</b> of which there are scarcely any other traces in Greek literature.|$|R

5|$|The Manikarnika Ghat is the Mahasmasana, {{the primary}} site for Hindu {{cremation}} in the city. Adjoining the ghat, there are raised platforms {{that are used}} for death anniversary rituals. According to <b>a</b> <b>myth</b> {{it is said that}} an earring of Shiva or his wife Sati fell here. Fourth-century Gupta period inscriptions mention this ghat. However, the current ghat as a permanent riverside embankment was built in 1302 and has been renovated at least three times throughout its existence.|$|E
5|$|The film {{compares the}} rise of the {{neoconservative}} movement in the United States and the radical Islamist movement, drawing comparisons between their origins, and remarking on similarities between the two groups. More controversially, it argues that radical Islamism as a massive, sinister organisation, specifically in the form of al-Qaeda, is <b>a</b> <b>myth,</b> or noble lie, perpetuated by leaders of many countries—and particularly neoconservatives in the U.S.—in a renewed attempt to unite and inspire their people after the ultimate failure of utopian ideas.|$|E
5|$|The gods were {{believed}} to have many names. Among them were secret names that conveyed their true natures more profoundly than others. To know the true name of a deity was to have power over it. The importance of names is demonstrated by <b>a</b> <b>myth</b> in which Isis poisons the superior god Ra and refuses to cure him unless he reveals his secret name to her. Upon learning the name, she tells it to her son, Horus, and by learning it they gain greater knowledge and power.|$|E

Titles like Duffel Bags Full of Dough, Game-Changing E-Minor and Fuck What You Heard and Zen or Die were thrown around before the band settled on <b>A</b> New <b>Myth.</b> <b>A</b> {{few weeks before the}} release of the album, Nkululeko Mthembu, one of the band's founding members died. The album was released on the morning prior to the death of South African elder and statesman Nelson Mandela and the title would thus become prophetic in the countries need for <b>a</b> new <b>myth</b> with the death of the Mandela era of forgiveness and <b>A</b> New <b>Myth</b> with the passing of the founder of the idea of a performance art space in Nkululeko Mthembu.|$|R

5|$|The legend that de' Medici {{introduced}} {{a long list}} of foods, techniques and utensils from Italy to France for the first time is <b>a</b> <b>myth</b> routinely discredited by most food historians. Items whose introduction to France have been attributed to Catherine include the dinner fork, parsley, the artichoke, lettuce, broccoli, the garden pea, pasta, Parmesan, as well as the turkey and tomato of the New World. She has also received credit for introducing sauces and a variety of dishes such as duck à l’orange and deviled eggs.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{accounts of}} the life of Joan of Arc have been challenged by revisionist authors. Claims made by such authors include: that Joan of Arc was not actually burned at the stake; that she was secretly the half sister of King Charles VII; that she was not a true Christian but a member of a pagan cult; and that most of the story of Joan of Arc is actually <b>a</b> <b>myth.</b> None of these claims are widely accepted by historians.|$|E
5|$|According to <b>a</b> <b>myth</b> in many cultures, cats have {{multiple}} lives. In many countries, they {{are believed to}} have nine lives, but in Italy, Germany, Greece, Brazil and some Spanish-speaking regions, they are said to have seven lives, while in Turkish and Arabic traditions, the number of lives is six. The myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cats exhibit to escape life-threatening situations. Also lending credence to this myth is the fact that falling cats often land on their feet, using an instinctive righting reflex to twist their bodies around. Nonetheless, cats can still be injured or killed by a high fall.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland {{introduces}} his Jamaican cousin Madame Claude to Peter, Joe, and Quagmire {{saying she}} is a psychic. Cleveland offers to have her read their palms and determine past lives they have had. Madame Claude then determines that Joe was once an octopus whose tentacles were bitten off by a shark, and Quagmire was Jack the Ripper. When Claude reads Peter's palm, she discovers that he was Griffin Peterson, the supposed founder of Quahog where the previously-mentioned history of Quahog was <b>a</b> <b>myth.</b> Most of the episode follows {{the story of this}} past life, the main characters therein having the appearance of regular Family Guy characters.|$|E
5|$|Four years later, Taylor was {{selected}} for the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm. In the 4×200m freestyle relay, he helped his team win bronze. There were no Olympic Games in 1916 because of the First World War. Taylor joined the Royal Navy in 1914 and kept fit by swimming around the ships when his ship was anchored at Scapa Flow. He {{was present at the}} Battle of Jutland. A popular story tells that {{during the course of the}} battle, his ship, HMS St. Vincent, was sunk and while the survivors waited for two hours to be rescued, Taylor swam around encouraging his crewmates. However, this story is probably <b>a</b> <b>myth</b> as HMS St Vincent was not sunk at the Battle of Jutland. He was transferred to HMS Ramillies where he remained until he was demobilised.|$|E
5|$|Geometric {{designs on}} pottery {{of the eighth}} century BC depict scenes from the Trojan cycle, {{as well as the}} adventures of Heracles. These visual {{representations}} of myths are important for two reasons. Firstly, many Greek myths are attested on vases earlier than in literary sources: of the twelve labors of Heracles, for example, only the Cerberus adventure occurs in a contemporary literary text. Secondly, visual sources sometimes represent myths or mythical scenes that are not attested in any extant literary source. In some cases, the first known representation of <b>a</b> <b>myth</b> in geometric art predates its first known representation in late archaic poetry, by several centuries. In the Archaic (c. 750–c. 500 BC), Classical (c. 480–323 BC), and Hellenistic (323–146 BC) periods, Homeric and various other mythological scenes appear, supplementing the existing literary evidence.|$|E
