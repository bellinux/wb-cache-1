40|$|The <b>address</b> <b>signal</b> {{lines are}} {{connected}} to a semiconductor memory device when they are implemented on the PCB (Printed Circuit Board). So they experience the wiring capacitance and due to this wiring capacitance on printed circuit board the rising and falling time of respective <b>address</b> <b>signal</b> disperse. If the <b>address</b> <b>signal</b> lines change in timing, the following problem occurs. When a microprocessor connected to a semiconductor memory device changes the address information from one address to another address, due to deviation of timing of the change of the <b>signal,</b> the wrong <b>address</b> is generated. In an Asynchronous semiconductor memory device, the change of address is immediately responded. So it also responds to such wrong address information and internal circuit selects the wrong address information and operates corresponds to that wrong address...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} an integrating current-mode CMOS pixel {{based on a}} novel reset/read-out strategy. In contrast to the conventional integrating mode pixel, here the reset and read-out phases of the imager are carried out simultaneously. In the new read-out strategy, only two current sources are enabled at any given time, resulting in a power consumption that is independent of both read-out speed and imager array size, while still allowing for on read-out FPN cancellation. The <b>addressing</b> <b>signals</b> of the proposed read-out strategy are generated using conventional counters and an address decoders, which are also used to generate the <b>addressing</b> <b>signals</b> required for an electronic shutter, resulting in significant saving in silicon area.

40|$|Administration of {{the thyroid}} hormone 3, 3, 5 '-triiodo-L-thyronine (T 3) to rats {{leads to a}} marked {{increase}} in hepatic levels of mRNA for cytochrome c. Messenger RNA prepared from the free polysomes of T 3 -treated rats directed the in vitro synthesis of a polypeptide which only differed in amino acid sequence from mature cytochrome c in that it contained an NH 2 -terminal methionine. The in vitro product was incorporated specifically into purified rat liver mitochondria and became inaccessible to added trypsin when the mitochondria were added after translation was completed. Horse heart apocytochrome c, but not the holocytochrome, could compete with the in vitro synthesized polypeptide for its uptake into mitochondria. This suggests that the primary structural features of apocytochrome c, which serve as an <b>addressing</b> <b>signal</b> for mitochondria, are masked after the acquisition of heme and that this process occurs in the mitochondria. The <b>addressing</b> <b>signal</b> seems to be contained in a specific segment of the cytochrome polypeptide because only one fragment generated by CNBr cleavage of horse apocytochrome c, extending from residue 66 to the carboxy end of the molecule, could compete with the in vitro product for its transfer into mitochondria...|$|R
