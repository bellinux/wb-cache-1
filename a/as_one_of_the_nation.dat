While its own management consciously professionalised their operations in accord with international post-war organisational principles, it also seeded the new thrusting breed of international commercial entrepreneurs who would replace it. The Tivoli 2 ̆ 7 s great assets were its long-standing institutional prestige and iconic status as Australia 2 ̆ 7 s major variety house; its chain of theatre buildings built or acquired in the capital cities; and a managerial culture which increasingly stressed the international, the excellent and the 2 ̆ 7 family 2 ̆ 7 audience. Of particular interest are the decades after World War II, which comprise Australian variety 2 ̆ 7 s loss of the large and predominantly masculinised audience of American and Australian servicemen; the international competition for acts caused by the renewed availability of communications and travel; the introduction of television in Australia for the 1956 Melbourne Olympics; and television 2 ̆ 7 s successorship <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> 2 ̆ 7 s dominant popular entertainment media.

Reliable, rapid, and cost-effective detection and remedial action {{can contribute to}} minimizing the adverse environmental and economic impacts of ground {{water contamination}}. This dissertation contributes to aquifer remediation by developing a set of planning tools for detection, mapping, monitoring and remediation of contaminated aquifers. The dissertation {{is divided into three}} main sections that correspond to a typical sequence of actions resulting in a final remedial action plan for handling contamination at a particular site. ^ The first section develops a methodology for detecting and mapping suspected contamination using multiple sources of data. Different data types are combined by using a modified form of kriging with uncertain data, termed compound kriging. In addition, the use of fuzzy set theory merged with geostatistics is explored as a possible mapping technique when variogram parameters are difficult to quantify. ^ A decision support system for observation network design is presented in the second section. Network design is approached from a multiple objective decision making perspective. The objective is to identify the most cost-effective network design while considering the trade-off between performance and cost. Geostatistical variance reduction analysis and prior knowledge related to the site are used as performance measures in the decision support system. ^ A remedial action design support system is described in the third section. Three dimensional geostatistical simulation and analytical ground water modeling are used to assess the need for further remedial action planning. In addition, a methodology for measuring the performance of candidate remediation systems under conditions of uncertainty in aquifer parameters and plume location is presented. These performance measures, combined with cost factors, are used in a multiple-criteria decision making system to determine the preferred clean up system for a site being investigated. ^ Each of the methods developed in this dissertation have been demonstrated using data collected from the site of a low-level radioactive industrial waste reprocessing facility near Wood River Junction, Rhode Island. ...|$|E
40|$|David B. Danbom, {{professor}} of history at North Dakota State University, Fargo, is widely respected <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> 2 ̆ 7 s leading authorities on agricultural history. His purpose in writing this book, to provide a general history of rural America combining traditional political and economic history with the new social history, he accomplishes with admirable success. Born in the Country will quickly become a standard text in the field. Danbom traces the history of agriculture from the nation 2 ̆ 7 s beginnings, when rural Americans dominated the nation, down to a present in which farmers and people living in rural areas have become a small minority. Among the book 2 ̆ 7 s major strengths is the quality of its writing: the author has a rare talent for synthesizing complex trends and developments in a few succinct sentences. The result is not only a readable book, but one that deals with important questions in a thoughtful manner. Moreover, the topics covered are balanced and comprehensive. The volume begins with a discussion of rural Europe and Pre-Columbian America, traces the history of agriculture from the Colonial period through the age of industrialization, and concludes with an analysis of agriculture and rural life {{at the end of the}} twentieth century. Consideration is given to every agricultural region in the United States. A further strength is the book 2 ̆ 7 s emphasis on social history. Danbom 2 ̆ 7 s discussion of women, minorities, rural values, and the lives of ordinary people who have worked in agriculture is both informative and engaging. Finally, the concluding chapters explaining the consequences of agriculture 2 ̆ 7 s modernization, especially since World War II, are cogently done. Clearly sympathetic to farmers and agriculture, Danbom has nonetheless written a book that is both scholarly and objective. Although it presents no new or controversial thesis about the history of rural America, it succeeds in being exactly what it intended to be, an excellent synthesis of past and present scholarship relating America 2 ̆ 7 s rural history. The thorough notes at the end of each chapter provide an excellent bibliography. Born in the Country is a welcome and needed addition to the historical literature of rural America...|$|E
