5|$|Annealing is {{the process}} of heating the steel to a {{sufficiently}} high temperature to relieve local internal stresses. It does not create a general softening of the product but only locally relieves strains and stresses locked up within the material. Annealing goes through three phases: recovery, recrystallization, and grain growth. The temperature required to <b>anneal</b> a particular steel depends on the type of annealing to be achieved and the alloying constituents.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{to single}} interstitials, divacancies {{do not produce}} photoluminescence. Divacancies, in turn, <b>anneal</b> out at ~900°C {{creating}} multivacancy chains detected by EPR and presumably hexavacancy rings. The latter should be invisible to most spectroscopies, and indeed, {{they have not been}} detected thus far. Annealing of vacancies changes diamond color from green to yellow-brown. Similar mechanism (vacancy aggregation) is also believed to cause brown color of plastically deformed natural diamonds.|$|E

Whereas AAV packages a single strand of DNA and requires the process of second-strand synthesis, scAAV packages both strands which <b>anneal</b> together to form double stranded DNA. By skipping second strand synthesis scAAV allows for rapid expression in the cell. Otherwise, scAAV carries many characteristics of its AAV counterpart.|$|E
40|$|AbstractFeSr 2 YCu 2 O 6 +δ (Fe 1212) shows {{superconductivity}} {{only after}} proper <b>annealing</b> in N 2 flow, subsequently, <b>annealing</b> in O 2 flow and under high O 2 pressure. In order to optimize {{each of the}} <b>annealing</b> temperature for superconductivity, Fe 1212 samples were <b>annealed</b> at various temperature in each <b>annealing</b> process. The optimized <b>annealing</b> condition is <b>annealing</b> in N 2 flow at 790 °C, <b>annealing</b> in O 2 flow and under high O 2 pressure at 270 °C.

Superconductivity of Fe 1212 was affected by temperature of N 2 <b>annealing</b> process rather than that of O 2 <b>annealing.</b> The N 2 <b>annealing</b> affects the offset superconducting transition temperature rather than the onset superconducting transition temperature.

50|$|Process <b>annealing,</b> {{also called}} {{intermediate}} <b>annealing,</b> subcritical <b>annealing,</b> or in-process <b>annealing,</b> is a heat treatment cycle that restores {{some of the}} ductility to a product being cold-worked {{so it can be}} cold-worked further without breaking.|$|R
25|$|The {{sample to}} analyze is {{optionally}} {{mixed with a}} chemical denaturant if so desired, usually SDS for proteins or urea for nucleic acids. SDS is an anionic detergent that denatures secondary and non–disulfide–linked tertiary structures, and additionally applies a negative charge to each protein in proportion to its mass. Urea breaks the hydrogen bonds between the base pairs of the nucleic acid, causing the constituent strands to <b>anneal.</b> Heating the samples to at least 60°C further promotes denaturation.|$|E
25|$|Annealing, in genetics, {{means for}} {{complementary}} sequences of single-stranded DNA or RNA to pair by hydrogen bonds {{to form a}} double-stranded polynucleotide. The term {{is often used to}} describe the binding of a DNA probe, or the binding of a primer to a DNA strand during a polymerase chain reaction. The term is also often used to describe the reformation (renaturation) of reverse-complementary strands that were separated by heat (thermally denatured). Proteins such as RAD52 can help DNA <b>anneal.</b>|$|E
25|$|Use of {{the virus}} does present some disadvantages. The cloning {{capacity}} of the vector is relatively limited and most therapeutic genes require the complete replacement {{of the virus}}'s 4.8 kilobase genome.

The AAV ITRs of two genomes can <b>anneal</b> to form head to tail concatamers, almost doubling the capacity of the vector.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} rapid thermal <b>annealing</b> on InGaNAs/GaAs quantum wells. At optimized <b>annealing</b> temperatures and times, the greatest enhancement of the photoluminescence intensity is obtained by a special two-step <b>annealing</b> process. To identify the mechanism affecting the material quality during the rapid thermal <b>annealing,</b> differential temperature analysis is applied, and temperature- and power-dependent photoluminescence is carried out on the samples <b>annealed</b> under different conditions. Our experiment reveals that some composition redistribution or other related ordering process may occur in the quantum-well layer during <b>annealing.</b> <b>Annealing</b> at a lower temperature {{for a long time}} primarily can remove defects and dislocations while <b>annealing</b> at a higher temperature for a short time primarily homogenizes the composition in the quantum wells...|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{steps of}} a touchdown polymerase chain reaction cycle have high annealing temperatures. The annealing temperature is decreased in increments for every subsequent set of cycles (the number of individual cycles and increments of temperature decrease is chosen by the experimenter). The primer will <b>anneal</b> at the highest temperature which is least-permissive of nonspecific binding that {{it is able to}} tolerate. Thus, the first sequence amplified is the one between the regions of greatest primer specificity; it is most likely that this is the sequence of interest. These fragments will be further amplified during subsequent rounds at lower temperatures, and will out compete the nonspecific sequences to which the primers may bind at those lower temperatures. If the primer initially (during the higher-temperature phases) binds to the sequence of interest, subsequent rounds of polymerase chain reaction can be performed upon the product to further amplify those fragments.|$|E
500|$|Homologous {{recombination}} via the SDSA pathway {{occurs in}} cells that divide through mitosis and meiosis {{and results in}} non-crossover products. [...] In this model, the invading 3' strand is extended along the recipient DNA duplex by a DNA polymerase, and is released as the Holliday junction between the donor and recipient DNA molecules slides in a process called branch migration. [...] The newly synthesized 3' end of the invading strand is then able to <b>anneal</b> to the other 3' overhang in the damaged chromosome through complementary base pairing. [...] After the strands <b>anneal,</b> a small flap of DNA can sometimes remain. [...] Any such flaps are removed, and the SDSA pathway finishes with the resealing, also known as ligation, of any remaining single-stranded gaps.|$|E
500|$|The single-strand {{annealing}} (SSA) pathway of {{homologous recombination}} repairs double-strand breaks between two repeat sequences. [...] The SSA pathway {{is unique in}} {{that it does not}} require a separate similar or identical molecule of DNA, like the DSBR or SDSA pathways of homologous recombination. Instead, the SSA pathway only requires a single DNA duplex, and uses the repeat sequences as the identical sequences that homologous recombination needs for repair. The pathway is relatively simple in concept: after two strands of the same DNA duplex are cut back around the site of the double-strand break, the two resulting 3' overhangs then align and <b>anneal</b> to each other, restoring the DNA as a continuous duplex.|$|E

500|$|As DNA {{around the}} double-strand break is cut back, the {{single-stranded}} 3' overhangs being produced are coated with the RPA protein, which prevents the 3' overhangs from sticking to themselves.

2500|$|Touchdown {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} or touchdown style {{polymerase chain reaction}} is a method of polymerase chain reaction by which primers will avoid amplifying nonspecific sequences. The annealing temperature during a polymerase chain reaction determines the specificity of primer annealing. The melting point of the primer sets the upper limit on annealing temperature. At temperatures just below this point, only very specific base pairing between the primer and the template will occur. At lower temperatures, the primers bind less specifically. Nonspecific primer binding obscures polymerase chain reaction results, as the nonspecific sequences to which primers <b>anneal</b> in early steps of amplification will [...] "swamp out" [...] any specific sequences because of the exponential nature of polymerase amplification.|$|E

2500|$|Hybridization is {{the process}} of {{establishing}} a non-covalent, sequence-specific interaction between two or more complementary strands of nucleic acids into a single complex, which in the case of two strands is referred to as a duplex. [...] Oligonucleotides, DNA, or RNA will bind to their complement under normal conditions, so two perfectly complementary strands will bind to each other readily. In order to reduce the diversity and obtain the most energetically preferred complexes, a technique called annealing is used in laboratory practice. However, due to the different molecular geometries of the nucleotides, a single inconsistency between the two strands will make binding between them less energetically favorable. Measuring the effects of base incompatibility by quantifying the temperature at which two strands <b>anneal</b> can provide information as to the similarity in base sequence between the two strands being annealed. The complexes may be dissociated by thermal denaturation, also referred to as melting. In the absence of external negative factors, the processes of hybridization and melting may be repeated in succession indefinitely, which lays the ground for polymerase chain reaction. Most commonly, the pairs of nucleic bases A=T and G≡C are formed, of which the latter is more stable.|$|E
