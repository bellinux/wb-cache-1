40|$|Documenting {{the long}} term impact of <b>structural</b> <b>policies</b> on {{economic}} performance has generated tremendous interest in the development literature. In contrast, contemporary effects of <b>structural</b> <b>policies</b> are difficult to establish. <b>Structural</b> <b>policies</b> seldom change sufficiently in the short run, and accepted instruments to control for endogeneity in cross sections are inappropriate for time series analysis. In this paper we utilize an eleven year panel of 26 transition countries to identify short term effects of <b>structural</b> <b>policies</b> that are large and significant. A ten percent change {{in the quality of}} <b>structural</b> <b>policies</b> (or the Rule of Law) towards OECD standards is shown to raise annual growth by about 2. 5 %. To control for endogeneity, we develop an instrument using the hierarchy of institutions hypothesis and find that it holds a robust explanatory power. We also document that early reformers reap the greatest benefits, but that it is never too late to begin <b>structural</b> <b>policy</b> reforms. <b>Structural</b> <b>policies</b> Growth Dynamic panel Transition economies...|$|R

40|$|The article {{contains}} a presentation {{of the main elements}} of the concept of regional <b>structural</b> <b>policy</b> of the Federal Republic of Germany. A point of departure for the analysis is a defnition of role and place of the regional <b>structural</b> <b>policy</b> within economic sciences. It allows to determine its role and scope, goals of particular entities and applied instruments. The regional <b>structural</b> <b>policy</b> holds a permanent place in the German economic thought as a part o f the economic policy pursued by the State. A specific character of the federal state implies special regulations concerning the problem of subjectiveness. Goals of the regional <b>structural</b> <b>policy</b> ensue from the pyramid of goals accepted within the framework of social market economy doctrine. The instruments applied have been subordinated to these goals. Both the theoretical experiments and the economic practice in Germany point a t the necessity of conducting a regional <b>structural</b> <b>policy</b> by the State irrespective of various discussions on the scope of state intervention in the economy.

40|$|<b>Structural</b> <b>policy</b> has two elements: {{rules of}} {{competition}} and concentration in the marketplace, and deliberate attempts to structure industrial sectors. Historically, Europe, Japan, and the U. S. have pursued quite dissimilar <b>structural</b> <b>policies,</b> reflecting their differing perceptions of the national interest, different international imperatives, and different conceptions {{of the role of}} the state. The automobile industry offers sharp cross-country comparisons of <b>structural</b> <b>policy</b> at i t s most vigorous. In this paper, the successes and failures of U. S. antitrust activity toward the automobile industry are considered in comparison to the relative absence of such policies abroad. Similarly, governments' attempts to develop internationally competitive automobile industries in Europe and Japan contrast with the domestic regulatory orientation in the U. S. This historical analysis suggests the current need for reorientations in national <b>structural</b> <b>policies</b> in order to deal effectively with internationalized markets, firms, and competition in the automobile and other industries today.

The promotion of sustainable economic growth and improved living standards in the Asia-Pacific region through enhanced trade and economic integration lies at the heart of APEC’s mission. While APEC’s focus has traditionally been on trade and investment liberalisation and facilitation, it is increasingly turning its attention also to the role played by “behind-the-border” policies in enabling or impeding regional economic integration (also commonly referred to as “structural policies” or “structural barriers”).
