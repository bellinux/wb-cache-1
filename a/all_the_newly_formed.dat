His ship with 100 troops was wrecked of the coast of Cuba, and they were marooned for a period on an offshore islet before being ferried to Havana.There they heard that the English pirate Christopher Myngs had sacked Campeche in February 1663, and were ordered to Campeche to assist in its defense.He reached Campeche by January 1664. On 15 October 1664 Muñoz Gadea was appointed sargento major and commander of the garrison of the city. In 1668 he resigned from this position.|$|E

At this stage, {{it is crucial to}} have a method to ‘track’ each gene products to the encoding gene as they become free floating in a heterogeneous population of molecules. There are three major approaches to track down each phenotype to its genotype. [...] The first method is to attach each DNA molecule with a biotin group and an additional coding sequence for streptavidin (STABLE display). <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>newly</b> <b>formed</b> proteins/peptides will be in fusion with streptavidin molecules and bind to their biotinylated coding sequence. An improved version attached two biotin molecules to the ends of a DNA molecule to increase the avidity between DNA molecule and streptavidin-fused peptides, and used a low GC content synthetic streptavidin gene to increase efficiency and specificity during PCR amplification. The second method is to covalently link DNA and protein. Two strategies have been demonstrated. The first is to form M.HaeIII fusion proteins. Each expressed protein/polypeptide will be in fusion with Hae III DNA methyltransferase domain, which is able to bind covalently to DNA fragments containing the sequence 5’-GGC*-3’, where C* is 5-fluoro-2 deoxycytidine. The second strategy is to use monomeric mutant of VirD2 enzyme. When a protein/peptide is expressed in fusion with Agrobacterium protein VirD2, it will bind to its DNA coding sequence that has a single-stranded overhang comprising VirD2 T-border recognition sequences. The third method is to link phenotype and genotype via beads. The beads used will be coated with streptavidin to allow for the binding of biotinylated DNA, in addition, the beads will also display cognate binding partner to the affinity tag that will be expressed in fusion with the protein/peptide.|$|E

40|$|The {{ontogeny}} of osmoregulation {{was examined}} in the branchial cavity of embryonic and early post-embryonic stages of the crayfish Astacus leptodactylus maintained in freshwater, at the sub-cellular level through the detection of the sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na(+),K(+) -ATPase). The embryonic rate of development was calculated according to the eye index (EI) which was 430 - 450 microm at hatching. The distribution of the enzyme was identified by immunofluorescence microscopy using a monoclonal antibody IgGalpha 5 raised against the avian alpha-subunit of the Na(+),K(+) -ATPase. Immunoreactivity staining, indicating the presence of Na(+), K(+) -ATPase appeared in the gills of late embryos (EI>/= 400 microm), i. e. {{a few days before}} hatching time, and steadily increased throughout the late embryonic and early post-embryonic development. The appearance of the enzyme correlates with the ability to osmoregulate which also occurs late in the embryonic development at EI 410 - 420 microm and with tissue differentiation within the gill filaments. These observations indicate that the physiological shift from osmoconforming embryos to hyper-regulating late embryos and post-hatching stages in freshwater must originate partly from the differentiation in the gill epithelia of ionocytes which are the site of ion pumping, as suggested by the location of Na(+),K(+) -ATPase. Only the gills were immunostained and a lack of specific staining was noted in the lamina and the branchiostegites. Therefore, osmoregulation through Na(+) active uptake is likely achieved in embryos at the gill level; <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>newly</b> <b>formed</b> gills in embryos function in ion regulation; other parts of the branchial chamber such as the branchiostegites and lamina {{do not appear to be}} involved in osmoregulation...|$|E

40|$|The only {{elements}} {{that were made}} in significant quantity during the Big Bang were hydrogen and helium, {{and to a lesser}} extent lithium. Depending on the initial mass of a star, it may eject some or <b>all</b> of <b>the</b> unique, <b>newly</b> <b>formed</b> elements into <b>the</b> interstellar medium. The enriched gas later collapses into new stars, which are able to form heavier elements due to the presence of the new elements. When we observe the abundances in a stellar regions, we are able to glean the astrophysical phenomena that occurred prior to its formation. I compile spectroscopic abundance data from 49 literature sources for 46 elements across 2836 stars in the solar neighborhood, within 150 pc of the Sun, to produce the Hypatia Catalog. I analyze the variability of the spread in abundance measurements reported for the same star by different surveys, the corresponding stellar atmosphere parameters adopted by various abundance determination methods, and the effect of normalizing <b>all</b> abundances to <b>the</b> same solar scale. The resulting abundance ratios [X/Fe] as a function of [Fe/H] are consistent with stellar nucleosynthetic processes and known Galactic thin-disk trends. I analyze the element abundances for 204 known exoplanet host-stars. In general, I find that exoplanet host-stars are not enriched more than the surrounding population of stars, with the exception of iron. I examine the stellar abundances with respect to both stellar and planetary physical properties, such as orbital period, eccentricity, planetary mass, stellar mass, and stellar color. My data confirms that exoplanet hosts are enriched in [Fe/H] but not in the refractory elements, per the self-enrichment theory for stellar composition. Lastly, I apply the Hypatia Catalog to the Catalog of Potentially Habitable Stellar Systems in order to investigate the abundances in the 1224 overlapping stars. By looking at stars similar to the Sun with respect to six bio-essential elements, I created maps that have located two ``habitability windows'' on the sky: (20. 6 h, - 4. 8 o) and (22. 6 h, - 48. 5 o).
