40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{technique}} for the fabrication of <b>active</b> <b>substrates</b> of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). It {{was found that}} the silver particles themselves and the analyte-covered silver particles can be trapped at the air-water interface. In the presence of electrolyte, for example, KCl that is generally used to activate silver colloids for additional SERS enhancement, the trapped silver particles and clusters can attract each other spontaneously to form two-dimensional silver particle films. By this technique, the prerequisite aggregation of silver colloids for the SERS process is provided. At the same time, because the aggregation occurs only at the interface, problems of irreversible aggregation and instability of silver colloids can largely be overcome. The SERS enhancement ability of these silver particle films is larger by 1 - 2 orders than that of usual <b>active</b> <b>substrates</b> such as silver colloids and silver mirror. Their strong enhancement ability may arise from the unique two-dimensional structure itself...|$|R

The SERS intensity of the probe molecule adsorbed at the nanowires depends critically on the length of the nanowires explored at the surface.

Applying this probe molecule strategy SERS could develop into a diagnostic tool of metal nanowires (nanorods) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} simple and {{versatile}} method to covalently immobilize molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) nanoparticles on a Raman <b>active</b> <b>substrate</b> (Klarite) using a disulfide-derivatized perfluorophenylazide (PFPA-disulfide). Gold-coated Klarite was functionalized with PFPA-disulfide via a gold sulfur bond. Upon light radiation, the available azido groups were converted to highly reactive singlet perfluorophenyl nitrene that undergoes a CH insertion reaction and form covalent bonds with the MIP nanoparticles. The resulting surfaces were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy to study the morphology and template affinity of the surfaces, respectively. The Raman measurements clearly show a dose-responsive signal when propranolol binds to the MIP surface. Because the MIP particles were covalently attached to the Raman <b>active</b> <b>substrate,</b> the sensing surface was stable and could be reused after regeneration in acetic acid solution. The MIP-based Raman sensor was used successfully to detect propranolol in urine samples (7. 7 X 10 (- 4) M).

Super hydrophobic substrates that combine super hydrophobic condensation effect and high enhancement ability of Ag@CuO nanoflowers are investigated for SERS studies. The possible growth mechanism {{for the formation of}} nanoflower arrays from nanospindles has been discussed. Morphology and crystallinity of the Ag@CuO thin films are confirmed using FESEM and XRD. The results obtained in the present study indicate that the as-deposited hydrophobic nanospindles structure converts to super hydrophobic nanoflower arrays on annealing at 200 degrees C. The Ag@CuO super hydrophobic nanoflowers thin film based SERS substrates show highly enhanced Raman spectra with an EF value of 2. 0 x 10 (7) for (Rhodamine 6 G) R 6 G, allowing a detection limit from a 10 (- 10) mol L- 1 solution.
