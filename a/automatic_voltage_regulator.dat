50|$|The {{main exciter}} is a 3,000 rpm 3-phase machine {{directly}} coupled {{to the main}} generator shaft. Cooling is effected by a closed air ventilation circuit with pannier mounted coolers supplied with cooling water from the condensate system. The exciter output is rectified by a 3-phase bridge-connected group of silicon diodes which are natural air cooled and accommodated in a bank of nine cubicles located on a platform cantilevered {{from the side of}} the foundation block. Mounted adjacent to the rectifiers is the main field suppression circuit-breaker which incorporates a discharge resistance and auxiliary switch to close the discharge circuit. A permanent magnet high frequency generator, directly coupled to the exciter shaft, acts as a pilot exciter and supplies the exciter field via a power stage magnetic amplifier which may be regulated either by manual control or by the <b>automatic</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator.</b> The AVR is a continuously acting regulator including such features as VAR limiting, automatic follow-up of manual control, and protection against over fluxing or over exciting of the main generator.|$|E
5000|$|A generators, as used {{in power}} {{stations}} or in standby power systems, will have <b>automatic</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> (AVR) to stabilize its voltage as the load on the generator changes. The first automatic voltage regulators for generators were electromechanical systems, but a modern AVR uses solid-state devices. An AVR is a feedback control system, that measures the output voltage of the generator, compares that output to a set point, and generates an error signal {{that is used to}} adjust the excitation of the generator. As the excitation current in the field winding of the generator increases, its terminal voltage will increase. The AVR will control current by using power electronics devices; generally {{a small part of the}} generator's output is used to provide current for the field winding. Where a generator is connected in parallel with other sources such as an electrical transmission grid, changing the excitation has more of an effect on the reactive power produced by the generator than on its terminal voltage, which is mostly set by the connected power system. Where multiple generators are connected in parallel, the AVR system will have circuits to ensure all generators operate at the same power factor. AVRs on grid-connected power station generators may have additional control features to help stabilize the electrical grid against upsets due to sudden load loss or faults.|$|E

50|$|Obtaining a DC supply {{controlled}} by rectifiers requires an AC power source. Consequently, the existing auxiliary generator was {{converted to a}} three-phase alternator with <b>automatic</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator.</b> This arrangement gives improved control of traction current over conventional rheostatic systems and gives fine control when starting a train. Normally the driver has to maintain tractive effort well below the rail adhesion limit to give himself time to respond to wheel slip. The constant current systems of Class 74 were designed to allow the driver to apply power very near the limit of adhesion and the booster output is regulated {{in such a way}} that the maximum current of any traction motor group does not exceed the selected value. Thus, even when one motor (axle, wheel set) starts slipping, the voltage across the whole group of motors cannot rise because current in the non-slipping motors is fixed. As one motor begins to slip, its current consumption drops (electric motors use greatest current when stalled and least while free-running) which provides more current for the non-slipping motor (The current for the group is fixed and therefore shared across the motors in the group). The voltage drops proportionately and the slipping motor now partly deprived of power, begins to slow, the slip stops and everything returns to the state it was in before slip set in. Simply speaking the motors all work as a differentially balanced team so that as one motor begins to slip, the others act to balance everything which reduces the speed of the slipping motor almost 'by magic', but maintains torque at a point just below friction break-away. Recovery of wheel slip (providing the driver is not in-attentive or deliberately attempting to slip) is very rapid. It is this system that allowed the incredible acceleration for which Class 74 was known.|$|E
