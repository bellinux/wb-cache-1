5|$|On March 20, 2017 the British paper The Guardian {{reported}} {{that hundreds of}} banks had helped launder KGB-related funds out of Russia, as uncovered by an investigation named Global Laundromat. NatWest was listed among the 17 banks in the UK that were “facing questions over what they knew about the international scheme <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> did not turn away suspicious money transfers,” as the bank processed $1.1 million in Laundromat cash. Other banks facing scrutiny under the investigation included HSBC, the Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, Barclays and Coutts.|$|E
5|$|The photo {{originated}} from a washed-out colour {{photograph of a}} dress posted on the social networking service Tumblr. In the first week after the surfacing of the image alone, more than 10 million tweets mentioned the dress, using hashtags such as #thedress, #whiteandgold and #blackandblue. Although the actual colour of the dress was eventually confirmed to be black and blue, the image prompted discussions surrounding the matter across various platforms, with users discussing their opinions on the colour <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> perceived the dress as being a certain colour. At the same time, members {{of the scientific community}} began to investigate the photo for fresh insights into human colour vision.|$|E
5|$|A concert film, Under Great White Northern Lights premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 18, 2009. The film, {{directed}} by Emmett Malloy, documents the band's summer 2007 tour across Canada and contains live concert and off-stage footage. Jack and Meg White {{appeared at the}} premiere and made a short speech before the movie started about their love of Canada <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> chose to debut their movie in Toronto. The tour was {{in support of the}} album Icky Thump, and they performed in every province. Jack conceived the idea of touring Canada after learning that Scottish relatives on his father's side had lived for a few generations in Nova Scotia before relocating to Detroit to work in the car factories. Additionally, their 10th anniversary occurred during the tour on the day of their show in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, and in this shot, Jack and Meg are dancing {{at the conclusion of the}} concert. The film was {{directed by}} a friend of the duo, Emmett Malloy. A second feature, titled Under Nova Scotian Lights, was prepared for the DVD release.|$|E

25|$|Conservative Judaism {{holds that}} Orthodoxy has {{deviated}} from historical Judaism through excessive concern with recent codifications of Jewish law.

25|$|Based on {{the current}} rate of {{increase}} - averaging about 2ppm per year - greenhouse gas concentrations are likely to reach 400ppm by 2016, 450ppm by 2041, and 550ppm by around 2091. It is because of this that environmental organisations and some political parties criticised the 60% target as being insufficiently ambitious, <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> demanded greater cuts (80%-100%), as mentioned below. The exclusion of emissions from aviation and shipping, combined with forecasts for growth in these areas, also means that the net effect of the bill would actually have only been a 35-50% total cut on 1990 levels by 2050.|$|E

The open letter contained complaints mostly based on religious grounds. There is now an official inquiry into this initiative.|$|E

25|$|The Orlac couple {{are forced}} to sell many of their {{possessions}} {{to pay for the}} surgery, while Stephen finds he is unable to play the piano with his new hands. When a creditor comes to claim the Orlacs' piano, Stephen throws a fountain pen that barely misses his head. Stephen seeks help from his stepfather, Henry Orlac (Ian Wolfe). Henry denies the request, upset that Stephen did not follow in his line of business as a jeweler. A knife thrown in anger by Stephen misses Henry, but breaks the shop front's window. Gogol meanwhile asks Yvonne for her love, but she refuses. Stephen goes to Gogol's home and demands to know about his hands, <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> throw knives. Gogol suggests that Stephen's problem comes from childhood trauma, but later confirms to his assistant Dr. Wong (Keye Luke) that Stephen's hands had been Rollo's.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} marvellous and fanciful reports of this history, the most {{probable}} interpretation {{is that the}} Mugharrarin reached the Sargasso Sea, {{a part of the}} ocean covered by seaweed, which is very close to Bermuda yet one thousand miles away from the American mainland. Then while coming back, they may have landed either on the Azores, or on Madeira or even on the westernmost Canary Island, El Hierro (because of the sheep). Last, the story with the inhabited island might have occurred either on Tenerife or on Gran Canaria, where the Mugharrarin presumably met some Guanche tribe. This would explain why some of them could speak Arabic (some sporadic contacts had been maintained between the Canary Islands and Morocco) <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> were quickly deported to Morocco where they were welcomed by Berbers. Yet, the story reported by Idrisi is an indisputable account of a certain knowledge of the Atlantic Ocean by Andalusians and Moroccans.|$|E
