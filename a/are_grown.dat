5|$|Animals {{are raised}} {{for a wide}} variety of products, principally meat, wool, milk, and eggs, but also {{including}} tallow, isinglass and rennet. Animals are also kept for more specialised purposes, such as to produce vaccines and antiserum (containing antibodies) for medical use. Where fodder or other crops <b>are</b> <b>grown</b> alongside animals, manure can serve as a fertiliser, returning minerals and organic matter to the soil in a semi-closed organic system.|$|E
5|$|Because of its mild climate, many species, {{including}} sub-tropical {{species such}} as palm trees, <b>are</b> <b>grown</b> in Ireland. Phytogeographically, Ireland belongs to the Atlantic European province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. The island itself can be subdivided into two ecoregions: the Celtic broadleaf forests and North Atlantic moist mixed forests.|$|E
5|$|Broadly speaking, {{radishes}} can {{be categorized}} into four main types according to the seasons when they <b>are</b> <b>grown</b> {{and a variety of}} shapes lengths, colors, and sizes, such as red, pink, white, gray-black, or yellow radishes, with round or elongated roots that can grow longer than a parsnip.|$|E

5|$|Cacti have {{a variety}} of uses: many species are used as {{ornamental}} plants, others <b>are</b> <b>grown</b> for fodder or forage, and others for food (particularly their fruit). Cochineal is the product of an insect that lives on some cacti.|$|E
5|$|Devices {{that must}} {{withstand}} extremely high temperatures are often made from iridium. For example, high-temperature crucibles made of iridium {{are used in}} the Czochralski process to produce oxide single-crystals (such as sapphires) for use in computer memory devices and in solid state lasers. The crystals, such as gadolinium gallium garnet and yttrium gallium garnet, <b>are</b> <b>grown</b> by melting pre-sintered charges of mixed oxides under oxidizing conditions at temperatures up to 2100°C.|$|E
5|$|Floating gardens, {{labelled}} the 'Rad' in tye Kashmiri {{language are}} a special {{feature of the}} lake. They basically constitute of matted vegetation and earth, but are floating. These are detached {{from the bottom of}} the lake and drawn to a suitable place (generally to the north west of the houseboats' location) and anchored.

5|$|Members of the Cucurbitaceae include gourds, melons, pumpkins, and squashes. Seeds {{from these}} plants are noted for their oil content, but little {{information}} is available on methods of extracting the oil. In most cases, the plants <b>are</b> <b>grown</b> as food, with dietary use of the oils as a byproduct of using the seeds as food.|$|E
5|$|Of all the alkaloids, only {{galantamine}} {{has made}} it to therapeutic use in man, as the drug galantamine for Alzheimer's disease. Galantamine is an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor which crosses the blood brain barrier and is active within the central nervous system. Daffodils <b>are</b> <b>grown</b> commercially near Brecon in Powys, Wales, to produce galantamine, a drug used to combat Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
5|$|The driest {{conditions}} {{persist in}} all inner alpine valleys that receive less rain because arriving clouds {{lose a lot}} of their content while crossing the mountains before reaching these areas. Large alpine areas such as Graubünden remain drier than pre-alpine areas and as in the main valley of the Valais wine grapes <b>are</b> <b>grown</b> there.|$|E
25|$|Kiwifruit can <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> in most {{temperate}} climates {{with adequate}} summer heat. Where fuzzy kiwifruit (A. deliciosa) is not hardy, other species can <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> as substitutes.|$|R

5|$|The {{most common}} {{commercial}} propagation method {{is referred to}} as 'twin scales'. This involves the division of the bulb into 12 sections and then separating each section into twin scales connected by the basal plate. The cuttings that are derived from these <b>are</b> <b>grown</b> in moist vermiculite in the dark till bulbils appear. More recently growing them in sunlight produce a better crop.|$|E
5|$|The radish (Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus) is an {{edible root}} {{vegetable}} of the Brassicaceae family that was domesticated in Europe in pre-Roman times. Radishes <b>are</b> <b>grown</b> and consumed throughout the world, being mostly eaten raw as a crunchy salad vegetable. They have numerous varieties, varying in size, flavor, color, {{and length of}} time they take to mature. Radishes owe their sharp flavor to the various chemical compounds produced by the plants, including glucosinolate, myrosinase, and isothiocyanate. They are sometimes grown as companion plants and suffer from few pests and diseases. They germinate quickly and grow rapidly, smaller varieties being ready for consumption within a month, while larger daikon varieties take several months. Another use of radish is as cover or catch crop in winter or as a forage crop. Some radishes <b>are</b> <b>grown</b> for their seeds; daikon, for instance, may be grown for oil production. Others are used for sprouting.|$|E
5|$|There {{are often}} {{substantial}} {{differences between the}} remiges and rectrices of adults and juveniles of the same species. Because all juvenile feathers <b>are</b> <b>grown</b> at once—a tremendous energy burden to the developing bird—they are softer and of poorer quality than the equivalent feathers of adults, which are moulted {{over a longer period}} of time (as long as several years in some cases). As a result, they wear more quickly.|$|E
50|$|The {{species may}} <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> in shade or sun, and is {{somewhat}} drought tolerant though it performs best in moist situations. It can withstand light to moderate frosts and prefers a sandy loam {{although it may}} <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> in rocky or clay-based soils. It may also <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> as a container plant in standard potting mix. Plants may be propagated by division.|$|R
50|$|It <b>is</b> <b>grown</b> {{both as a}} herb and as an {{ornamental}} plant. In cooler latitudes it {{is killed}} by winter frost, but can <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> as an annual. Cultivars include 'Spanish Eyes'.|$|R
50|$|Mattu Gulla {{is said to}} have <b>been</b> <b>grown</b> since 400 {{years in}} Matti, with a legend linking its origins to Vadiraja. It was {{cultivated}} within an area of more than 500 acres between the Udyavar river and Swarna river. Apart from Matti, it <b>is</b> <b>grown</b> in surrounding villages like Pangala, Kopla and Kaipunjal. The land on which it <b>is</b> <b>grown</b> <b>is</b> enriched with fish meal manure.|$|R
5|$|A yellowish-brown pigment is {{diffused}} {{through the}} cytosol of the hyphae and is much deeper in color {{just below the}} cuticle of the cap. In very young fruit bodies, stems and caps are very pale buff, but soon {{the color of the}} cap deepens and becomes cinnamon. The intensity of the color appears to be dependent on light, for when fruit bodies <b>are</b> <b>grown</b> in diffuse light (temperature and humidity being constant) they are a uniform pale buff color, but in bright light they are cinnamon or tan.|$|E
5|$|Cowpeas <b>are</b> <b>grown</b> {{mostly for}} their edible beans, {{although}} the leaves, green peas and green pea pods {{can also be}} consumed, meaning the cowpea {{can be used as}} a food source before the dried peas are harvested. Like other legumes, cowpea grain is cooked to make it edible, usually by boiling. Cowpeas can be prepared in stews, soups, purees and casseroles, but the most common way to eat them is in curries. They can also be processed into a paste or flour. Chinese long beans can be eaten raw or cooked, but as they easily become waterlogged are usually sautéed, stir-fried, or deep-fried.|$|E
5|$|Cucurbita (Latin for gourd) is a genus of {{herbaceous}} vines in {{the gourd}} family, Cucurbitaceae, {{also known as}} cucurbits, native to the Andes and Mesoamerica. Five species <b>are</b> <b>grown</b> worldwide for their edible fruit, variously known as squash, pumpkin, or gourd depending on species, variety, and local parlance, and for their seeds. Other kinds of gourd, also called bottle-gourds, are native to Africa and belong to the genus Lagenaria, {{which is in the}} same family and subfamily as Cucurbita but in a different tribe. These other gourds are used as utensils or vessels, and their young fruits are eaten much like those of Cucurbita species.|$|E
50|$|Epacris microphylla is an {{attractive}} and hardy garden plant {{as long as it}} <b>is</b> <b>grown</b> in well-drained soil. It is difficult to propagate from seed but can <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> from semi-hard tip cuttings.|$|R
