After graduating in 1940, Lee decided to quit clinical medicine and keep on studying. He became the assistant of Tsungming Tu, who was researching on basic medical studies and, at the time, the only Taiwanese professors in the medical department. He once said, To gain honor for Taiwan, dignity for the Taiwanese, I chose to follow Professor Tu instead of several other Japanese professors.

40|$|Western Buddhists often {{believe and}} {{proclaim}} that metaphysical speculation {{is irrelevant to}} Buddhist ethics or practice. This view is problematic even with respect to early Buddhism, and cannot be sustained regarding later Indian Buddhists. In Śāntideva’s famous Bodhicaryāvatāra, multiple claims {{about the nature of}} reality are premises for conclusions about how human beings should act; that is, metaphysics logically entails ethics for Śāntideva, as it does for many Western philosophers. This article explores four key arguments that Śāntideva makes from metaphysics to ethics: actions are determined by their causes, <b>and</b> therefore <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not get angry; the body is reducible to its component parts, <b>and</b> therefore <b>we</b> <b>should</b> neither protect it nor lust after other bodies; the self is an illusion, <b>and</b> therefore <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be altruistic; all phenomena are empty, <b>and</b> therefore <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not be attached to them. The exploration of these arguments together shows us why metaphysical claims can matter a great deal for Buddhist ethics, practice and liberation...|$|R

In 1925, he became president of the Akron Bar Association. One of Willkie's clients, Ohio Power & Light, was owned by New York-based Commonwealth & Southern Corporation (C), whose chairman, B.C.

500|$|Descent 3 is {{the first}} project {{developed}} by Outrage Entertainment. The company was founded when Parallax Software, creators of previous Descent games, decided to split in two: Outrage Entertainment and Volition. Volition would focus on creating the combat space simulator FreeSpace games, while Outrage would continue with the Descent series. Development on Descent 3 began in November 1996 {{with a team of}} eight people. According to programmer Jason Leighton, one of the major problems during the game's development cycle was a lack of direction and control. He explained that the team had [...] "No code reviews, no art reviews, [...] no way of saying, 'This is bad <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be going in a different direction'". This [...] "anarchistic" [...] development environment worked for Descent and Descent II because they were developed by small groups that worked closely together and often in the same room. However, as Outrage started to grow from eight people to almost 20 {{by the end of the}} project, the developers did not introduce enough management to control the process. As Leighton recalls, [...] "we literally had to build the team and company at the same time we started production on the game".|$|E

The extent {{and nature of the}} British press coverage of Mills has been criticised, as in May 2003, when Guardian columnist Matt Seaton wrote a piece declaring [...] "There is little that is edifying in the symbolic lynching of Heather. The poisonous judgmentalism that drives it is in the worst tradition of small town gossip. It is prurient, spiteful, hypocritical, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> cry 'shame' on it". Publicist Mark Borkowski wrote in the Independent on Sunday, on 23 March 2008: [...] "Not since the cult of Myra Hindley have we encountered so much vitriol aimed at one woman". Feminist writer Natasha Walter has compared the coverage to that of Britney Spears. Terence Blacker wrote that public figures who are young, female, pretty and fair-haired, are often subjected to public bullying which is explained as [...] "intense media interest", such as Diana, Princess of Wales, Paula Yates, Ulrika Jonsson and Mills.|$|E
500|$|Conference {{notes and}} draft {{decisions}} illustrate {{the division of}} opinions before the decision was issued. Justices Douglas, Black, Burton, and Minton were predisposed to overturn Plessy. Fred M. Vinson noted that Congress had not issued desegregation legislation; Stanley F. Reed discussed incomplete cultural assimilation and states' rights and was inclined {{to the view that}} segregation worked to the benefit of the African-American community; Tom C. Clark wrote that [...] "we had led the states on to think segregation is OK <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> let them work it out." [...] Felix Frankfurter and Robert H. Jackson disapproved of segregation, but were also opposed to judicial activism and expressed concerns about the proposed decision's enforceability. Chief Justice Vinson had been a key stumbling block. After Vinson died in September 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Earl Warren as Chief Justice. Warren had supported the integration of Mexican-American students in California school systems following Mendez v. Westminster. However, Eisenhower invited Earl Warren to a White House dinner, where the president told him: [...] "These [...] are not bad people. All they are concerned about is to see that their sweet little girls are not required to sit in school alongside some big overgrown Negroes." [...] Nevertheless, the Justice Department sided with the African American plaintiffs.|$|E

500|$|According to Baley, on July 29 Savedra {{informed}} the Rose–Baley Party, now camped near Leroux Springs, {{that the next}} reliable drinking water was seventy or [...] away, and {{there would not be}} a closer source until the coming rainy season. This distance exceeded what most animals could travel without water, and several members of the party were opposed to proceeding any further west until another source had been found. Udell disagreed, [...] "I contended that we had better travel on, for, with careful and proper treatment, we could get the stock through to water, and if we remain here until the rainy season, in all human probability our provisions would be exhausted, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> parish with starvation." [...] Despite his pleas, nobody wanted to go on until they had located potable water, so six men agreed to undertake a search in hopes that Savedra had overlooked a closer source. Two days later, a man returned to camp and reported that a spring had been found [...] west, but its supply was so sparse that it could not {{meet the needs of the}} entire wagon train at once. After a thorough debate it was decided that, despite stern warnings from Army officers in Albuquerque against splitting into smaller groups, the best course of action was to divide the train in two and water their stock separately.|$|E
500|$|The {{military}} {{ordered a}} flight test using liquid rather than solid fuel in early 1942. Upon the United States' {{entry into the}} Second World War in December 1941, the Group realized they could be drafted directly into military service if they failed to provide viable JATO technology for the military. Informed by their left-wing politics, aiding the war effort against Nazi Germany and the Axis powers was {{as much of a}} moral vocation to Parsons, Forman and Malina as it was a practical one. Parsons, Summerfield and the GALCIT workers focused on the task and found success with a combination of gasoline with red fuming nitric acid as its oxidizer; the latter, suggested by Parsons, was an effective substitute for liquid oxygen. The testing of this fuel resulted in another calamity, when the testing rocket motor exploded; the fire, containing iron shed fragments and shrapnel, inexplicably left the experimenters unscathed. Malina solved the problem by replacing the gasoline with aniline, resulting in a successful test launch of a JATO-equipped A-20A plane at the Muroc Auxiliary Air Field in the Mojave Desert. It provided five times more thrust [...] than GALCIT-27, and again reduced takeoff distance by 30%; Malina wrote to his parents that [...] "We now have something that really works <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be able to help give the Fascists hell!" ...|$|E
