5|$|Whatever Tiberius's motives, the {{withdrawal}} was almost disastrous for Augustus's succession plans. Gaius and Lucius {{were still in}} their early teens, and Augustus, now 57 years old, had no immediate successor. There was no longer <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> of a peaceful transfer of power after Augustus's death, nor <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> that his family, and therefore his family's allies, would continue to hold power should the position of princeps survive.|$|E
5|$|After the king's {{death on}} June 28, 572, Helmichis married Rosamund and claimed the Lombard throne in Verona. The {{marriage}} {{was important for}} Helmichis: it legitimized his rule because, judging from Lombard history, royal prerogatives could be inherited by marrying the king's widow; and the marriage was <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> for Helmichis of the loyalty of the Gepids in the army, who sided with the queen since she was Cunimund's daughter.|$|E
5|$|During the Torstenson War, {{a theater}} of the Thirty Years' War, {{extensive}} combat {{took place in the}} Danish provinces of Skåne, Halland, and Blekinge.

5|$|Nuaym's stratagem worked. After consulting, the Confederate leaders sent Ikrimah to the Qurayza, {{signalling}} {{a united}} invasion of Medina. The Qurayza, however, demanded hostages as <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> that the Confederacy would not desert them. The Confederacy, {{considering that the}} Qurayza might give the hostage to Muhammad, refused.

5|$|The prisoners' leaders {{made three}} demands: {{a meeting with}} Attorney General Joseph Berinson, access to the media, and <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> of no {{retribution}} afterwards. The next morning, after 19 hours, the hostages were released, even though only the third demand had been met.

He claimed that the remaining students were willing to leave the mosque and lay down their arms, provided the government would grant them amnesty and not fire on them.

In {{a telephone interview from}} a live transmission of Geo TV, Ghazi Abdul Rashid denied all the charges against him and reiterated his innocence. He further negotiated with the government for his safe passage and <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> that no harm would come to his followers inside the mosque.

5|$|Abovian saw in {{strengthening}} of the friendship of Russian and Armenian peoples <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> of the national, political and cultural revival of his native lands. However; when Abovian wrote the novel he was already disillusioned with Tsarist policies in Armenia, particularly {{with the implementation of}} Polozhenie (Statute) in 1836 which greatly reduced the political power of the Armenian Catholicos and the abolishment of the Armenian Oblast in 1840. In the novel, elements of romanticism and realism are interlaced while the narration is supplanted by lyrical retreats.|$|E
5|$|As Belgium had {{suffered}} so much damage in World War I, {{there was little}} appetite within the country to involve itself in any potential European conflict. In October 1936, King Leopold III announced that Belgium would remain neutral {{in the event of}} another war in Europe as part of what he termed an Independent Policy (Politique d'Indépendance). To this end, the Belgian government tried to steer a path away from alliances: leaving the Locarno Treaty, repudiating a defence pact with France signed in 1920 and receiving <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> of neutrality from Nazi Germany in 1937.|$|E
5|$|During the Sarajevo Crisis in 1914, German diplomats offered Turkey an anti-Russian {{alliance}} and territorial gains in Caucasia, north-west Iran and Trans-Caspia. The pro-British faction {{in the cabinet}} was isolated due to the British ambassador taking leave until 18 August. As the crisis deepened in Europe, Ottoman policy was to obtain <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> of territorial integrity and potential advantages, unaware that the British might enter a European war. On 30 July 1914, {{two days after the}} outbreak of the war in Europe, the Ottoman leaders agreed to form a secret Ottoman-German Alliance against Russia, although it did not require them to undertake military action.|$|E

She often wrote to Ivan IV ("Ivan the Terrible"), on amicable terms, though the Tsar was often annoyed by her focus on commerce {{rather than on the}} possibility of a military alliance. The Tsar even proposed to her once, and during his later reign, asked for <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> to be granted asylum in England should his rule be jeopardised.|$|E
5|$|Few {{vocabulary}} {{items are}} considered unique to Ottawa.

Given that vocabulary spreads readily from one dialect to another {{the presence of a}} particular vocabulary item in a given dialect is not <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> of the original source of the item. Two groups of function words are characteristically Ottawa: the sets of demonstrative pronouns and interrogative adverbs are both distinctive relative to other dialects of Ojibwe. Although some of the vocabulary items in each set are found in other dialects, taken as a group each is uniquely Ottawa.|$|E
5|$|Germany and the Netherlands were {{eventually}} {{able to reach}} an agreement where Germany would release plans and drawings based upon their ideas for a battlecruiser, in return for <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> that all needed equipment would be ordered from German firms. With their assistance (mainly through NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw), a rough design was formulated by February 1940. A visit to Italy prompted a rethink of the internal layout, which led to a set of drawings dated 19 April 1940. This is the last known design produced prior to Germany's invasion and occupation of the Netherlands. Final plans for the ships were never completed, and the ships were never constructed.|$|E

The paper proposes an efficient scheme for combining asynchronous and synchronous traffic on the upstream channel of a CM network when segmentation of the asynchronous packets is to be avoided, e. g. because of cost considerations. The new scheme guarantees the synchronous sources the same quality of service provided by the FDDI timed token protocol.

5|$|In Vancouver, the {{organization}} Save the Grizzlies {{was established to}} find a local investor to purchase the team. Led by among others Peter Ufford, they had a plan to create a public entity which could take over ownership of the team. Ufford retrospectively stated that had the attempt been given more time, {{they may have been}} able to secure a deal to keep the team in town, but that the relocation decision came too quickly for any plan to be finalized. Heisley stated that he had been willing to sell the team with a 30% discount to a Vancouver investor if he could secure <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> that the team would remain in town.|$|E
5|$|In {{return for}} a loan and <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> of Danish protection, Bishop Johann von Münchhausen signed a treaty on 26September 1559 giving Frederick II of Denmark the right to {{nominate}} the bishop of Ösel–Wiek, an act which amounted to the sale of these territories for 30,000 thalers. Frederick II nominated his brother, Duke Magnus of Holstein as bishop, who then took possession in April 1560. Lest Danish efforts create more insecurity for Sweden, Denmark made another attempt to mediate a peace in the region. Magnus at once pursued his own interests, purchasing the Bishopric of Courland without Frederick's consent and trying to expand into Harrien–Wierland (Harju and Virumaa). This brought him into direct conflict with Eric.|$|E
5|$|Khalid {{argued that}} he had conquered the city by force. Abu Ubaidah {{maintained}} the city had capitulated, through the peace agreement between him and Thomas. The corps commanders discussed the situation, and reportedly told Khalid that the peace agreement must be honored. Their rationale had logic: if other Byzantines in Syria heard that the Muslims had given <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> of safety to a surrendered city and then had slaughtered those whose safety had been guaranteed, no other city would ever surrender to the Muslims. This would make the task of conquering Syria immeasurably more difficult. Khalid, though not happy, agreed to honor the peace agreement.|$|E
40|$|The idea of <b>a</b> <b>guaranteed</b> {{income has}} <b>a</b> long and respectable history in Canadian {{political}} and economic thought. Recently, {{in the face of}} both wide criticism of the Canadian income security system and growing recognition of the unacceptability of current poverty rates, there has been a resurgence in calls for implementation of <b>a</b> Canadian <b>guaranteed</b> income. But the idea is a controversial one; progressive activists, academics, and politicians disagree about the desirability and the practicality of <b>a</b> <b>guaranteed</b> income. This report: Traces the history of guaranteed income proposals in Canada; Catalogues both the most common reasons supporting advocacy of <b>a</b> <b>guaranteed</b> income and the most telling concerns raised by the notion; Provides an overview of basic dimensions along which proposals for <b>a</b> <b>guaranteed</b> income differ and sets out models that capture much of the range of proposals in the current debate; and Suggests a number of other social welfare measures that should be central elements of any reform program, but that guaranteed income debates often ignore. The term “guaranteed income” refers to a specific although broad category of social reform. As a starting place for discussion, the idea of <b>a</b> <b>guaranteed</b> income is used to signal reform proposals that advocate some variant of an income benefit scheme in which the state provides a minimum level of basic income on a continuing basis to every adult, irrespective of personal circumstances or need, with no or very few conditions attached. Proponents of <b>a</b> <b>guaranteed</b> income cite <b>a</b> range of reasons supporting the idea: A fix to poverty; Liberty and individual opportunity; Social and democratic citizenship; Gender equality; Shared social ownership; A flexible and just labour market; and Environmental sustainability...|$|R
