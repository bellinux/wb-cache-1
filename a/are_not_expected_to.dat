5|$|A {{total of}} 142 riders have been {{qualified}} {{in the event}} at these Games. Most of them <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> finish one-day races, having worked in support for their teams (in this case, nations) to place their riders with better climbing skills in good positions once the mountainous part of a course begins. Many of these riders also sought to conserve themselves for the time trial that was to come. Additionally, if a rider was lapped by the race leader on the Badaling circuit, he {{would be forced to}} stop.|$|E

5|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that this collision will disrupt the orbits of the planets in the Solar System. Although {{it is true that}} the gravity of passing stars can detach planets into interstellar space, distances between stars are so great that the likelihood of the Milky Way–Andromeda collision causing such disruption to any individual star system is negligible. Although the Solar System as a whole could be affected by these events, the Sun and planets <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be disturbed.|$|E

5|$|The exam {{is offered}} {{every year in}} May. Students <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> {{memorize}} any formulas; rather, a list of common statistical formulas related to descriptive statistics, probability, and inferential statistics is provided. Moreover, tables for the normal, Student's t and chi-squared distributions are given as well. Students are also expected to use graphing calculators with statistical capabilities. The exam is three hours long with ninety minutes allotted to complete each of its two sections: multiple choice and free-response. The multiple choice portion of the exam consists of forty questions with five possible answers each. The free response section contains six open-ended questions that are often long and divided into multiple parts. The first five of these questions may require twelve minutes each to answer and normally relate to one topic or category. The sixth question consists of a broad-ranging investigative task and may require approximately twenty-five minutes to answer.|$|E
5|$|When {{a warrior}} is so old, or sustains an injury {{that means they}} can no longer serve their Clan, they retire to become elders. Elders live out the {{remainder}} of their life in general peace, using it as a time of rest and relaxation. They sleep in their own separate den, which is looked after by the apprentices. Elders <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> hunt or fight for their Clan, but are able to do so if the mood takes them. Their only expected duty is to carry the body of a deceased Clanmate to their grave. Every cat of the Clan respects and appreciates the elders, thanking them for the time they have spent upholding their roles as a warrior. Sadly, it is rare for a Clan to have more than three or four elders, as many warriors die before they can retire.|$|E
5|$|Until 2010, {{despite a}} {{breeding}} range estimated at , the corn crake {{was classified as}} near threatened on the IUCN Red List because of serious declines in Europe, but improved monitoring in Russia indicates that anticipated losses there have not occurred and numbers have remained stable or possibly increased. It is therefore now classed as least concern, since the major populations in Russia and Kazakhstan <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> change much in the short term. There are an estimated 1.3–2.0 million breeding pairs in Europe, three-quarters {{of which are in}} European Russia, and a further 515,000–1,240,000 pairs in Asiatic Russia; the total Eurasian population has been estimated at between 5.45 and 9.72 million individuals. In much of the western half of its range, there have been long-term declines that are expected to continue, although conservation measures have enabled numbers to grow in several countries, including a five-fold increase in Finland, and a doubling in the UK. In the Netherlands, there were 33 breeding territories in 1996, but this number had increased to at least 500 by 1998.|$|E

25|$|The noble metals of {{this series}} of {{transition}} metals <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be as noble as their lighter homologues, due {{to the absence of}} an outer s shell for shielding and also because the 7d shell is strongly split into two subshells due to relativistic effects. This causes the first ionization energies of the 7d transition metals to be smaller than those of their lighter congeners.|$|E

25|$|The halakha {{requires}} {{eating and}} traditionally {{sleeping in the}} sukkah. However, Jews <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> remain in the sukkah {{if they would be}} very uncomfortable there. For this reason, Jews living at northern latitudes will generally not sleep in the sukkah due to the cold temperatures of autumn nights. Some Jews in these locales will spend some time in the sukkah eating and relaxing but go indoors to sleep.|$|E
25|$|The {{organization}} {{has been assigned}} a pool of $9.1433 million to use when signing players taken in the first 10 rounds. In addition, any bonus greater than $100,000 for a player taken after the 10th round will apply toward the bonus-pool total. Any team going up to 5 percent over its allotted pool will be taxed at a 75 percent rate on the overage. Overspending beyond 5 percent would cost the team future Draft picks, which the Cardinals <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> do. The signing deadline is July 15.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to direct methods, iterative methods <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> terminate in {{a finite number}} of steps. Starting from an initial guess, iterative methods form successive approximations that converge to the exact solution only in the limit. A convergence test, often involving the residual, is specified in order to decide when a sufficiently accurate solution has (hopefully) been found. Even using infinite precision arithmetic these methods would not reach the solution within {{a finite number of}} steps (in general). Examples include Newton's method, the bisection method, and Jacobi iteration. In computational matrix algebra, iterative methods are generally needed for large problems.|$|E
25|$|Alevis <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> give Zakat in the Orthodox-Islamic mode, {{and there}} is no set formula or {{prescribed}} amount for annual charitable donation as there is in Sunnism (2.5% of possessions above a certain minimum). Rather, they are expected to give the 'excess' according to Qur'an verse 2:219. A common method of Alevi almsgiving is through donating food (especially sacrificial animals) to be shared with worshippers and guests. Alevis also donate money to be used to help the poor, to support the religious, educational and cultural activities of Alevi centers and organizations (dergâh, vakıf, dernek), and to provide scholarships for students.|$|E

Although the RCSC and the other cadet {{programs}} are sponsored by the Canadian Forces and the civilian Leagues, cadets are not regular members of the Forces and <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> join the regular Canadian Forces. In keeping with Commonwealth custom, the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets stand first {{in the order of}} precedence, before the Army Cadets and Air Cadets. This is in keeping with the Royal Navy's status as the Senior Service, a tradition common to most Commonwealth navies.|$|E
