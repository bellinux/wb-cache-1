5|$|When pressurised, a {{cylinder}} carries an equivalent volume of free gas greater than its water capacity, because the gas is compressed {{up to several}} hundred times atmospheric pressure. The selection of an appropriate set of diving cylinders for a diving operation {{is based on the}} amount of gas required to safely complete the dive. Diving cylinders are most commonly filled with air, but because the main components of air can cause problems when breathed underwater at higher ambient pressure, divers may choose to breathe from cylinders filled with mixtures of gases other than air. Many jurisdictions have regulations that govern the filling, recording of contents, and labelling for diving cylinders. Periodic inspection and testing of cylinders is often obligatory {{to ensure the safety of}} operators of filling stations. Pressurised diving cylinders are considered dangerous goods for commercial transportation, and regional and international standards for colouring and labelling may <b>also</b> <b>apply.</b>|$|E
