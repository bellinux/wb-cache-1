40|$|In this chapter, {{we study}} {{the problem of}} {{selecting}} documents so as to extract terrorist event information from a collection of documents. We represent an event by its entity <b>and</b> <b>relation</b> instances. Very often, these entity <b>and</b> <b>relation</b> instances have to be extracted from multiple documents. We therefore define an information extraction (IE) task as selecting documents and extracting from which entity <b>and</b> <b>relation</b> instances relevant to a user-specified event (aka domain specific event entity <b>and</b> <b>relation</b> extraction). We adopt domain specific IE patterns to extract potentially relevant entity <b>and</b> <b>relation</b> instances from documents, and develop a number of document ranking strategies using the extracted instances to address this extraction task. Each ranking strategy (aka pattern-based document ranking strategy) assigns a score to each document, which estimates the latter 2 ̆ 7 s contribution to the gain in event related instances. We conducted experiments on two document collection datasets constructed using two historical terrorism events. Experiments showed that our proposed patternbased document ranking strategies performed well on the domain specific event entity <b>and</b> <b>relation</b> extraction task for document collections of various sizes...|$|R

In 1700, five years later, the Duke finally paid the Queen her dowry; her inheritance, however, remained sequestered, <b>and</b> <b>relations</b> with Modena worsened again when Rinaldo allied himself with Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I.

5|$|As Mary was {{an infant}} when she {{inherited}} the throne, Scotland was ruled by regents until she became an adult. From the outset, there were two claims to the Regency: one from Catholic Cardinal Beaton, and the other from the Protestant Earl of Arran, who was next in line to the throne. Beaton's claim {{was based on a}} version of the late king's will that his opponents dismissed as a forgery. Arran, with the support of his friends <b>and</b> <b>relations,</b> became the regent until 1554 when Mary's mother managed to remove and succeed him.|$|E

As with government officials, many Peninsular bishops abandoned their dioceses and their posts were not filled for decades until new prelates could be created <b>and</b> <b>relations</b> between the new nations and the Vatican were regularized. Then as the Church recovered, its economic and political power was attacked by liberals.|$|E
5|$|As a precautionary move Alboin {{strengthened}} his {{alliance with}} the Avars, signing what Paul calls a foedus perpetuum ("perpetual treaty") and what is {{referred to in the}} 9th-century Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani as a pactum et foedus amicitiae ("pact and treaty of friendship"), adding that the treaty was put down on paper. By the conditions accepted in the treaty, the Avars were to take possession of Pannonia and the Lombards were promised military support in Italy should the need arise; also, for a period of 200years the Lombards were to maintain the right to reclaim their former territories if the plan to conquer Italy failed, thus leaving Alboin with an alternative open. The accord also had the advantage of protecting Alboin's rear, as an Avar-occupied Pannonia would make it difficult for the Byzantines to bring forces to Italy by land. The agreement proved immensely successful, <b>and</b> <b>relations</b> with the Avars were almost uninterruptedly friendly during the lifetime of the Lombard Kingdom.|$|E

He {{was present at the}} Scone parliament of 27 September 1367, which discussed royal revenues <b>and</b> <b>relations</b> with the English crown. He was also present at the Scone parliament of June 1368, and the Perth parliament of 6 March 1369; the latter discussed royal business, relations with the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Norway, and law and order in the Scottish Highlands. Robert Stewart, Thomas, Earl of Mar, Uilleam III, Earl of Ross, and other Highland lords, were ordered to impose greater control in their regions. Bishop Walter took part in two parliamentary committees, the first a clerical committee devoted to general business, and the second a judicial committee authorised to review earlier legal judgments in the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Captain Fernão Pires de Andrade (also spelled as Fernão Peres de Andrade; in {{contemporary}} sources, Fernam (Fernã) Perez Dandrade) (died 1552) was a Portuguese merchant, pharmacist, and official diplomat under the explorer and Portuguese Malacca governor Afonso de Albuquerque. His encounter with Ming China in 1517—after initial contacts by Jorge Álvares and Rafael Perestrello in 1513 and 1516, respectively—marked {{the resumption of}} direct European commercial and diplomatic contact with China. (Even though there were Europeans in Medieval China, notably Marco Polo, that period of contact had been interrupted {{by the fall of}} the Yuan dynasty.) Although de Andrade's mission was initially a success that allowed a Portuguese embassy to proceed all the way to Beijing, relations were soon spoiled by culminating events that led to an extremely negative impression of the Portuguese in China. This included acts of his brother Simão that enraged the Chinese, false reports of the Portuguese being cannibals of kidnapped Chinese children and true reports of their conquest of Malacca, a loyal Ming tributary state. Normalized trade <b>and</b> <b>relations</b> between Portugal and the Ming dynasty would not resume until the late 1540s and the 1557 establishment of Portuguese rule over Macau.|$|E

His brother took the precaution of removing the razors from his home, but Collier appears to have smuggled one to his room, and used it to cut his own throat early in the morning on 24 March 1824. His servant who was sleeping in the same room immediately brought help, but nothing could be done and Collier died less than five minutes after inflicting the injury. The inquest later determined that 'The deceased destroyed himself, being in a state of temporary mental derangement.' The baronetcy became extinct upon his death.|$|E

5|$|David and her editor Jill Norman had {{discussed}} such a book {{as early as}} the 1970s, but work on other projects precluded it. After David's death, Norman found when sorting out her papers that David had written and compiled far more material on a Christmas theme than anyone else had realised. Among the papers was an introduction that David had written for the projected volume, in which she said that one of her motives for writing a book about Christmas cooking was to head off the annual last-minute requests for recipes from her friends <b>and</b> <b>relations.</b> Those she had found most frequently asked for formed the core of the book. Together with some Christmas recipes from Mediterranean Food, French Provincial Cooking, and Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen, and revised articles published in previous years in magazines, they were turned into a 214-page book. The chapters dealt with the social and historical side of Christmas, first courses and cold meats, soups, poultry and game, meat, vegetables and salads, sauces, pickles and chutneys, and desserts, cakes and drinks.|$|E
5|$|Harrison allowed Secretary of State-designate Daniel Webster to edit {{his inauguration}} speech, but he {{nevertheless}} spoke {{for an hour}} and 45 minutes, setting a record for verbosity that still stands. As the public was not excluded from the White House, there was no relief from the swarms of office seekers even after March 4, <b>and</b> <b>relations</b> with Clay broke down {{to such an extent that}} President Harrison banned him from the White House. Clay left town, never to see the President again. Harrison, despite the office seekers, liked to walk to the market each morning but on March 24 got caught in the rain and soon fell ill. The primitive treatment he received, possibly influenced by his own medical training a half-century old, did nothing to improve his condition, and he died in the early morning hours of April 4.

A royal council of fifteen magnates was formed in June that year, {{and the rule of}} the country transferred from the king to the council. With foreign help Henry's reign was restored in 1261 as the council were reluctant to start a civil war. Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, raised a rebellion. In 1264 civil war broke out between those loyal to the king and the baronial forces led by de Montfort.|$|E
