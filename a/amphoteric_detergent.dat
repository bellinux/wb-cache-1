40|$|Magnesium in plasma is {{determined}} by diluting a 50 - 4 sample with 5. 0 mL of stable calmagite reagent containing the <b>amphoteric</b> <b>detergent</b> Empigen BB, and buffered with 2 -amino- 2 -methyl- 1 -propanol at pH 11. 5. The calcium response is masked with strontium-buffered [ethylene-bis(oxyethylenenitrilo) ]tetraacetate (EGTA), while iron is masked with triethanolamine. The detergent causes an increased separation of the test and blank spectral ab-sorbance bands. The test absorbance peaks, which may be measured immediately, are at 520 nm, while the blank peak shifts from 610 to 655 nm on addition of detergent. The blank absorbance at 520 nm is relatively decreased by the detergent. This allows {{the use of a}} more concen-trated calmagite reagent, which in turn extends the linear relation of absorbance to magnesium concentration to...|$|E
40|$|Using calmagite as the compleximetric {{agent in}} spectro-photometric {{measurements}} of magnesium in serum involves a nonspecific matrix effect, which may bias results {{by as much}} as 25 to 30 % if aqueous standards are used in serum assays. We have overcome this effect by simply adding 5 pL of the <b>amphoteric</b> <b>detergent</b> Empigen BB (300 g/L; Albright and Wilson Ltd., Whitehaven, U. K.) to each reaction cuvette. We used a standard diagnostic kit for assaying magnesium (cat. no. 595 -A; Sigma Chemical Co., Taufkirchen, F. R. G.), which is based on the calmagite method of Ingman and Rungbom (1). Like Abernethy and Fowler (2), we found that adding Empigen BB shifted the absorbance mRvimum of the blank, but not of the magnesium. -calmagite complex, thus increasing the signal-to-noiseratio. Furthermore, the posi...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to standardize the technical variables for preparation and storage of Plasmodium falciparum and of antigen components extracted with the <b>amphoteric</b> <b>detergent</b> Zwittergent. P. falciparum obtained from in vitro culture was stored at different temperatures and for different periods of time. For each variable, antigen components of the parasite were extracted in {{the presence or absence of}} protease inhibitors and submitted or not to later dialysis. Products were stored for 15, 30 and 60 days at different temperatures and immunological activity of each extract was determined by SDS-PAGE and ELISA using positive or negative standard sera for the presence of IgG directed to blood stage antigens of P. falciparum. Antigen extracts obtained from parasites stored at - 20 oC up to 10 days or at - 70 oC for 2 months presented the best results, showing well-defined bands on SDS-PAGE and Western blots and presenting absorbance values in ELISA that permitted safe differentiation between positive and negative sera...|$|E
40|$|Activation {{of human}} {{platelets}} with thrombin transiently increases phosphorylation at (558) threonine of moesin as determined with phosphorylation state-specific antibodies. This specific modification is completely inhibited by the kinase inhibitor staurosporine and maximally {{promoted by the}} phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A, {{making it possible to}} purify the two forms of moesin to homogeneity. Blot overlay assays with F-actin probes labeled with either [32 P]ATP or 125 I show that only phosphorylated moesin interacts with F-actin in total platelet lysates, in moesin antibody immunoprecipitates, and when purified. In the absence of detergents, both forms of the isolated protein are aggregated. Phosphorylated, purified moesin co-sediments with alpha- or beta/gamma-actin filaments in cationic, but not in anionic, nonionic, or <b>amphoteric</b> <b>detergents.</b> The interaction affinity is high (Kd, approximately 1. 5 nM), and the maximal moesin:actin stoichiometry is 1 : 1. This interaction is also observed in platelets extracted with cationic but not with nonionic detergents. In 0. 1...|$|R
