40|$|The {{feasibility}} of an off axis x ray reflection zone plate to perform wavelength dispersive spectroscopy, on axis point focusing, and two dimensional imaging {{is demonstrated by}} means of {{one and the same}} diffractive optical element DOE at a synchrotron radiation facility. The resolving power varies between 30 and 400 in the range of 7. 6 keV to 9. 0 keV, with its maximum at the design energy of 8. 3 keV. This result is verified using an <b>adjustable</b> <b>entrance</b> slit, by which horizontal H and vertical V focusing to 0. 85 amp; 956;m H and 1. 29 amp; 956;m V is obtained near the sagittal focal plane of the astigmatic configuration. An angular and axial scan proves an accessible field of view of at least 0. 6 arcmin 0. 8 arcmin and a focal depth of plus minus 0. 86 mm. Supported by the grating efficiency of around 17. 5 and a very short pulse elongation, future precision x ray fluorescence and absorption studies of transition metals at their K edge on an ultrashort timescale could benefit from our finding...|$|E
40|$|We report silicon isotopic {{determinations}} for USGS rock {{reference materials}} BHVO- 1 and BHVO- 2 using a Nu Plasma multi-collector (MC) -ICP-MS, upgraded {{with a new}} <b>adjustable</b> <b>entrance</b> slit, to obtain medium resolution, {{as well as a}} stronger primary pump and newly designed sampler and skimmer cones ("B" cones). These settings, combined with the use of collector slits, allowed a resolution to be reached that was sufficient to overcome the (NO) -N- 14 -O- 16 and N- 14 (2) interferences overlying the Si- 30 and the Si- 28 peaks, respectively, in an earlier set-up. This enabled accurate measurement of both delta Si- 30 and delta Si- 29. The delta value is expressed in per mil variation relative to the NBS 28 quartz reference material. Based on data acquired from numerous sessions spread over a period of six months, we propose a recommended average delta Si- 30 of - 0. 33 +/- 0. 05 parts per thousand and - 0. 29 +/- 0. 11 parts per thousand (2 se) for BHVO- 1 and BHVO- 2, respectively. Our BHVO grand mean silicon isotope composition (delta Si- 30 = - 0. 31 +/- 0. 06 parts per thousand) is significantly more negative than the only published value for BHVO- 2, but is in very good agreement with the recently established average value of ocean island basalts (OIB), confirming the conclusion that the OIB reservoir has a distinct isotopic composition from the solar reservoir as sampled by chondrites...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the use of}} the commercially available Fabry-Perot etalons (FP) for the imaging of the solar chromosphere in the H alpha line of HI. Three etalons of 40, 60 and 90 mm diameter were accurately analysed. At normal incidence the maximum transmission wavelength as well as the finesse were evaluated. Polynomial curves precisely fitting the transmitted central wavelength variations when using a quasi-parallel beam from a point-like source are presented. Further calibrations have been done with photometric accuracy using a laboratory set-up comprising i/ a 16 bits CCD camera; ii/ a Littrow spectrograph of a spectral power 110000 giving a linear dispersion of 0. 0058 nm/pixel and iii/ an artificial Sun used as a light source and iv/ precisely adjustable in position optical components, including the F-P etalons. In addition, a precise laboratory wavelength calibration was performed using a low pressure deuterium 2 D spectral lamp simultaneously illuminating the <b>adjustable</b> <b>entrance</b> slit using a splitter before. The variations of the FWHM of the spectral transmission variations {{as a function of the}} incidence angle of a parallel beam are also given for each etalon. Consequences resulting from the use of a low but significant aperture/ratio are tentatively discussed for the first time. An application to a precise photometric work of solar physics interest when using limb filtergrams is illustrated and discussed, with emphasis on the photometric accuracy resulting from the use of such etalons put before the entrance aperture of an imaging telescope. Monochromatic images of the solar chromosphere shell in the vicinity of the polar and equatorial limbs were made using a small telescope, in order to deduce the variation of the typical average thicknesses at poles and equator interpreted as a prolateness effect of the chromospheric shell observed during the last minimum of solar activity (2009).
