40|$|Arteries from spontaneously {{hypertensive}} rats (SHR), stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) and Wistar-Kyoto controls (WKY) {{were fixed}} by immersion and plastic embedded. The media cross-sectional {{area and the}} length of the internal elastic membrane were measured.

An increase of the media to radius ratio was already demonstrable in visceral <b>arterial</b> <b>branches</b> of SHR and SHRSP by 15 days of age, indicating that changes of arterial structure could be of pathogenetic importance in early hypertension. At seven months of age the ratio was significantly increased in mesenteric <b>arterial</b> <b>branches</b> of SHR and SHRSP and in renal <b>arterial</b> <b>branches</b> of SHRSP. The media to radius ratio was markedly increased in the renal and superior mesenteric arterial trunks of adult SHR (P less than 0. 001 in both) and SHRSP (P less than 0. 001 and P less than 0. 01). This was due to a greater media cross-sectional area in the former vessels and to a combination of greater media and reduced radius in the latter...|$|R

50|$|Despite its {{relative}} initial remoteness {{to the rest}} of Saskatoon, Sutherland was initially one of eastern gateways to the city, as Highway 5 entered the city along 115th Street and wound its way through the townsite, this link was later rendered redundant in the 1960s when College Street was extended eastward and became College Drive, linking up with Highway 5; 115th Street continued to connect to Highway 5, however, providing an alternate access into Sutherland until it was closed in the 1980s to facilitate residential development. Access to Sutherland was further facilitated by the completion of the northeast leg of the Circle Drive ring road in 1983, although construction of the freeway resulted in the closure of 115th Street which had previously connected with Preston Avenue; however, this link was later replaced by Attridge Drive, a major <b>arterial</b> <b>branch</b> off Circle Drive that also linked with Preston.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) is {{transcribed}} in the VEGF 120, VEGF 164, or VEGF 188 isoforms, which differ in receptor binding, matrix association, and angiogenic activity. This vascular growth factor has {{been implicated in}} the development of the renal vasculature, but the role of the distinct VEGF isoforms remains unknown. In the present report, renal angiogenesis and arteriogenesis were studied in VEGF 120 / 120 mice, expressing only the short VEGF 120 isoform. In VEGF 120 / 120 mice, ingrowth and survival of capillaries in glomeruli, remodeling of peritubular capillaries, vascular coverage by pericytes, and branching of renal arteries were all severely impaired, causing abnormal glomerular filtration and impairing renal function. The <b>arterial</b> <b>branching</b> defect might be related to a reduced expression of renin, a presumed renal <b>arterial</b> <b>branching</b> factor. Glomerulosclerosis and tubular dilatio...|$|R

40|$|Endovascular {{aneurysm}} repair {{has evolved}} into a routine procedure for the treatment of abdominal and thoracic aortic and peripheral aneurysms. 1 - 3 However, the use of endograft devices is limited to patients with aneurysms of suitable anatomy. Numerous devices are on the market, with some first- and second-generation stent-grafts having already been withdrawn due to improvements in the newer generation devices. 4 Among others, single-layer bare stents have been used clinically to treat aneurysms, but the porosity must be so low that the device becomes too rigid and inflexible to conform well to the vessel wall. 5 If an aneurysm is adjacent to or involving a major <b>arterial</b> <b>branch,</b> a stent-graft would occlude the branch as well. 6 If an aneurysm is particularly large, embolization becomes more problematic and expensive if coils are used. How then could one treat a large, wide-necked aneurysm in proximity to or involving a major <b>arterial</b> <b>branch?</b> A new type of multilayer self-expanding stent technology has been developed that may offer an endovascular alternative to surgery in such cases. 7 We report herein our initial experience with this novel technology in patients with aneurysms, particularly those involving side-branches...|$|E
