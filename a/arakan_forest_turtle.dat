2500|$|Historic Hill {{contains}} Bird House, Bird Garden, Sea Lion Sound, Herpetarium, Chain of Lakes, Flight Cage and Cypress Swamp, and Primate House. The Bird House features birds {{as varied}} as bald eagle, rhinoceros hornbill, hyacinth macaw, burrowing owl, toco toucan, Cape thick-knee, golden pheasant, kookaburra, Mariana fruit-dove, king vulture, horned guan, superb starling, tawny frogmouth, and the Guam kingfisher, which is extinct in the wild. The Bird Garden contains outdoor bird enclosures. Sea Lion Sound provides an underwater viewing tunnel of California sea lions and three harbor seals. The herpetarium houses most of the zoo's reptiles and amphibians, including the critically endangered Jamaican iguana, Chinese alligator, McCord's box turtle, Panamanian golden frog, and <b>Arakan</b> <b>forest</b> <b>turtle.</b> Other species include the Komodo dragon, green anaconda, mountain chicken, spotted turtle, false gharial, king cobra, Gila monster, frill-necked lizard, Aldabra giant tortoise, tuatara, reticulated python, tiger salamander, three-toed amphiuma, pancake tortoise, and over two dozen species of pit vipers from around the world. The Chain of Lakes {{is a series of}} small enclosures between the Bird House and the Herpetarium and Primate House, where the zoo's North American river otters and alligator snapping turtles reside. In 1904, the Flight Cage was the largest bird cage ever built, and {{is still one of the}} world's largest free-flight aviaries at [...] long, [...] wide, and [...] high. The Cypress Swamp is dedicated to North American birds found it the cypress swamps of the southern Mississippi River. Among the birds in the aviary are black-crowned night heron, blue-winged teal, bufflehead duck, cattle egret, double-crested cormorant, great egret, wood duck, northern bobwhite, roseate spoonbill, snowy egret, and American white ibis. Primate House is home to the zoo's monkeys and lemurs. Species included are Allen's swamp monkey, Coquerel's sifaka, golden-headed lion tamarin, black-and-white colobus monkey, lion-tailed macaque, pygmy marmoset, ring-tailed lemur, and white-faced saki.|$|E

5000|$|... "The animals {{seem to be}} {{extremely}} difficult to establish in captivity," [...] said Peter Paul van Dijk, director of the tortoise and freshwater turtle program for Conservation International. Only 14 <b>Arakan</b> <b>forest</b> <b>turtles</b> are housed in Association of Zoos and Aquariums-accredited institutions in the United States, at Zoo Atlanta, the St. Louis Zoo, the Miami Metro Zoo, River Banks Zoo and Garden in Columbia, South Carolina, and the Knoxville Zoo.|$|R
50|$|The Zoo Atlanta {{herpetology}} department manages {{more than}} 450 {{reptiles and amphibians}} representing over 100 species, though {{because of the size}} of the World of Reptiles exhibit building, not all of these animals can currently be displayed. The zoo is the only zoological institution to successfully breed <b>Arakan</b> <b>forest</b> <b>turtles,</b> a critically endangered species harvested nearly to extinction for food and traditional medicine. A rare Guatemalan beaded lizard hatched at Zoo Atlanta in March 2012.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Arakan</b> <b>forest</b> <b>turtle</b> (Heosemys depressa) {{is a rare}} turtle species which lives only in the Arakan {{hills of}} western Myanmar and the {{bordering}} Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh. [...] The <b>Arakan</b> <b>forest</b> <b>turtle</b> is a semiterrestrial turtle, meaning it can survive in aquatic as well as terrestrial habitats, but as adults, they prefer living in terrestrial habitats. [...] The turtle remains dormant {{the majority of the}} time by hiding in leaves and debris if they are not foraging for food. The <b>Arakan</b> <b>forest</b> <b>turtle</b> is an omnivore, feeding on both animals and plants. Although these turtles are considered a relatively reserved animal for the majority of their daily activity, they are aggressive when it comes to eating insects, worms, and fish. They also consume fruit that falls to the forest floor.|$|E
50|$|Between January 21, and February 14, 2000, a {{group of}} {{scientists}} participated in an expedition to central Rakhine, formerly Arakan, State {{in the western part of}} Myanmar, formerly Burma, to gain information on the <b>Arakan</b> <b>forest</b> <b>turtle.</b> The expedition yielded one male <b>Arakan</b> <b>forest</b> <b>turtle,</b> with a carapace length of 22.cm, a mass of 1.3 kg, and 18 plastral annuli. It was discovered by a hunter’s dog on 7 February about 30 m from a small stream in bamboo forest on Salu Taung, along the Arakan Yoma. The carapace was severely damaged with signs of abnormal healing.|$|E
50|$|In May 2007, Zoo Atlanta, {{the only}} <b>Arakan</b> <b>forest</b> <b>turtle</b> {{breeding}} {{facility in the}} world, announced the successful hatching of the fourth hatchling {{to have been born}} there in the last six years. They also announced another egg was near hatching, and two additional hatchlings did not survive. Arakan forest turtles only mate once a year, and the eggs take 100 days to hatch.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, {{scientists}} discovered wild <b>Arakan</b> <b>forest</b> <b>turtles</b> for {{the first}} time in history in an elephant sanctuary in Myanmar. The research, carried out in 2003 and 2009, used canines and survey teams working with locals to search for the rare species.A survey of local hunters in the area revealed several possible behavioral characteristics of the turtle, such as a nocturnal lifestyle and increased activity during the early wet season. They also claim to find around two or three turtle eggs when skinning female specimens around June and July, possibly revealing the reproductive system and cycle of the species.The scientific team also labeled the area as a good prospective place to focus conservation efforts for the turtle, despite the fact that locals do occasionally hunt and eat them. Even with those activities, the elephant sanctuary is difficult to access and lacks any human settlement, making any human interference with the turtle merely opportunistic. No large-scale commercial project hunts the turtle, nor would there be a demand for one, since the turtle is too difficult to find compared to the little profit there is for doing so. Furthermore, the area even has a low risk of being exploited for natural resources, as easier-to-access areas nearby are abundant with them.|$|R
50|$|Some other species, {{initially}} placed here also, are now {{in different}} genera.

50|$|The Arakan Mountains act as {{a barrier}} to the southwestern monsoon rains and thus shield the central Myanmar area, making their western slopes {{extraordinarily}} wet during the monsoon with typically over 1 m of rain per month, and the eastern slopes much drier. They include the Chin Hills-Arakan Yoma montane forests ecoregion which is home to an elephant population and also the critically endangered <b>Arakan</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>Turtle</b> which was considered extinct.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Arakan</b> <b>forest</b> <b>turtle</b> was {{believed}} extinct (last seen in 1908), but in 1994 was rediscovered {{when a few}} specimens turned up in Asian food markets.

Only a handful of these conservation-reliant turtles are in captivity, and their status in the wild, which is dubious at best, is listed as critical.|$|E
50|$|In 2016, conservationists {{surveying}} the super-remote, little-known Chittagong Hill Tracts region of Bangladesh took the country’s first ever {{photos of the}} sun bear and gaur.

50|$|Philippine <b>forest</b> <b>turtles</b> {{are readily}} {{recognizable}} by their ginkgo-shaped vertebral scutes and a pale white to yellow line traversing across its head behind the ears. The previous characteristic has earned it the nickname of 'bowtie turtle'.|$|R
50|$|In 2001, {{during an}} {{assessment}} of endemic wildlife of the island of Palawan, live specimens of Philippine <b>forest</b> <b>turtles</b> were rediscovered. It soon became apparent that natural populations of the species existed in Palawan. Diesmos et al. (2004) have concluded that Taylor and/or Lopez may have somehow confused the type locality of the original specimens. Lopez also collected turtle specimens from the islands of Coron and Busuanga in Palawan. Specimens from Palawan may have been mistakenly exchanged with actual specimens from Leyte (which were probably Cyclemys dentata). It is now presumed that Philippine <b>forest</b> <b>turtles</b> have never been introduced outside of Palawan, and thus were not actually from Leyte.|$|R
