40|$|In {{recent years}} an {{interest}} in applying the principles of evolution {{to the study of}} culture emerged in the social sciences. Archaeologists and anthropologists reconsidered the role of innovation in particular, and have moved toward characterizing innovation in cultural systems not only as a product but also as an evolutionary process. This distinction was familiar to biology but new to the social sciences; cultural evolutionists from the nineteenth to the twentieth century had tended to see innovation as a preprogrammed change that occurred when a cultural group "needed" to overcome environmental problems. In this volume, leading researchers from a variety of disciplines—including anthropology, archaeology, evolutionary biology, philosophy, and psychology—offer their perspectives on cultural innovation. The book provides not only a range of views but also an integrated account, with the chapters offering an orderly progression of thought. The contributors consider innovation in biological terms, discussing epistemology, <b>animal</b> studies, <b>systematics</b> and phylogeny, phenotypic plasticity and evolvability, and evo-devo; they discuss modern insights into innovation, including simulation, the random-copying model, diffusion, and demographic analysis; and they offer case studies of innovation from archaeological and ethnographic records, examining developmental, behavioral, and social patterns...|$|R

The alignment and analysis of the sequences showed variable numbers of substitutions in CYP gene and reconstructed tree was having satisfactory bootstrap support. The sequence polymorphisms resulted from the nucleotide sequence substitutions of the CYP gene indicates that all the mammals were evolved from a common ancestor. Some genotypic changes have taken place leading to the diversification of same orders into different clades. Canis familiaris have clustered with distantly related species of order Artiodactyla comprising of Sus scrofa, Bos tauras and Avis Aries which have resulted due to the sequence similarities among them.

Ornithology {{is one of the}} most important branches of modern biology, and ornithologists were pioneer researchers in the areas of evolution, <b>systematics,</b> <b>animal</b> behaviour, zoogeography, migration, population biology and ecology. The institutional development of ornithology in Canada was much retarded by the prevailing utilitarian attitude towards science with its lack of funding for fundamental research. It was not until the second decade of the twentieth century that ornithology became part of the scientific establishment of the Canadian government. Despite this, Canadian ornithologists, in face of considerable difficulties stemming from the lack of encouragement and financial support, pursued pioneering studies in migration, behaviour and population biology of birds. Their research contributions were instrumental in taking ornithology from nineteenth century natural history to twentieth century avian biology...|$|R

Despite {{the importance of}} Dermacentor species as vectors of human and <b>animal</b> disease, the <b>systematics</b> of the genus remain largely unresolved. This study focuses on phylogenetic relationships of the eight North American Nearctic Dermacentor species: D. albipictus, D. variabilis, D. occidentalis, D. halli, D. parumapertus, D. hunteri, and D. andersoni, and the recently re-established species D. kamshadalus, {{as well as two}} of the Neotropical Dermacentor species D. nitens and D. dissimilis (both formerly Anocentor). We sequenced portions of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene, and the ribosomal 12 S and 16 S genes from the largest sampling of North American Dermacentor ticks analyzed to date. In all analyses, we found that North American Dermacentor ticks form a monophyletic lineage, and that all four species of one-host Dermacentor ticks also form a monophyletic lineage within the genus. The placement of the former Anocentor species, D. nitens and D. dissimilis in Dermacentor is also well supported.

40|$|Introduction At the Department of <b>Animal</b> <b>Systematics</b> and Zoogeography of the Free University Amsterdam {{the object}} of study has been already {{for a number of}} years the {{systematics}} and phylogeny of the microlepidopteran family Nepticulidae. Particularly the species of the western palearctic region have been studied, but also studies on species from New Zealand and Japan have been undertaken. Ideas about the phylogenetic relationships between genera of Nepticulidae are developed. Until now knowledge of Nepticulidae in East Asia, apart from Japan and the Ussuryisk region in the USSR has been negligible because of the lack of material from this part of the world in museum collections. Judging from the distribution of the hostplants in E. Asia the Nepticulid fauna certainly must be very rich. This means that collecting trips to any of the East Asian countries might very well result in the discovery of many hitherto unknown species of this family of moths. The agreement between the Peoples Republic of China and our country gave our department an excellent opportunity to establish cooperation on the study of Nepticulidae with the Zoological Institute of the Academia Sinica, Beijing. The head of our department, Prof. C. Wilkinson, visited the Zoological Institute (and several others) during December 1983 and January 1984 to establish the initial contacts with our counterpart Prof. Liu Youqiao and investigate museum collections. It appeared that even in the P. R. C. very few species of Nepticulidae were present in museum collections, so it became apparent that a collecting trip would be the first step necessary in starting a cooperative study of Nepticulidae in China. This report gives the experiences and preliminary results of this first collecting trip, which lasted from September 4 th till November 1 st, 1984. The purpose was to collect larvae of Nepticulidae, rear them out, set up a pinned collection to enalble further study, preserve their mines and prepare a herbarium of food plants of the collected Nepticulidae species. Another purpose was to show our Chinese colleagues the necessary techniques for studying microlepidoptera and Nepticulidae in particular, thus enabling them to start their own study and cooperate with us...|$|E
40|$|Could anyone survive Antarctic glaciations?: Evolution in {{the extreme}} {{environment}} {{and the effect of}} climatic changes on Antarctic biota Karel Janko 1, Eva Kasparova* 1, Anton Van de Putte 2, Craig Marshall 3 1 Laboratory of Fish Genetics, Institute of Animal Physiology and Genetics, Czech Republic, 2 K. U. Leuven, Laboratory for <b>Animal</b> Diversity and <b>Systematics,</b> Belgium, 3 Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago, New Zealand Antarctica and the southern Ocean are important determinants of global climate and ocean currents. Yet, polar ecosystems, and Antarctic in particular, are assumed to be very vulnerable to climate changes. While lot of effort is put into modelling the impact of future climate changes on polar biota, we offer an alternative retrospective approach based on simultaneous population genetic analysis of several species with different ecological requirements. We perform comparative analysis of demographic histories of a dozen fish species belonging to the suborder Notothenioidei. These include high Antarctic as well as sub Antarctic species, specialised on both benthic and pelagic life styles. Based on previous analysis of few available data on fish species, we predict that affinity to benthic life style and high Antarctic occurrence promotes the vulnerability to ice sheet advances during glacial maxims. Such species should be characterised by rather recent signals of population expansion from unglaciated refuges as compared to pelagic species. In agreement with the hypothesis, we generally observed more recent signals of population expansions in benthic species but some notable exceptions clearly suggest the need of more fine-scale analysis taking into account other life history traits. Such multiparameter analysis, however, critically depends on large amount of studied taxa. Nevertheless, our data ameliorate the ability to determine the general impact of past glacial cycles on local biota as well as to identify the lifehistory traits affecting the organismal response to such events. status: publishe...|$|R
