40|$|Research {{reveals that}} there are severe {{problems}} on connecting theory <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> <b>in</b> pre-service teacher education programs in Turkey. This descriptive study was limited by examining the decisions and applications related to connecting theory <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> <b>in</b> pre-service teacher education since 1998. Results are organized by concerning the factors like durations and semesters of field experiences, efficiencies of the stakeholders of teacher education programs. In conclusion connecting theoy <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> <b>in</b> pre-service teacher education is considered important in Turkey.

Voluntary blood donation comprises about 70% of the blood demand, with the rest coming from replacement donors, whereas 62 nations in the world fulfill their blood demands through voluntary donations. A study conducted in 2011 reports that a mere 6% of women donate blood, mostly due to physiological problems and low hemoglobin count.

500|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, {{use of the}} term [...] "New Age" [...] was {{increasingly}} common within the cultic milieu.

He noted that as this happened, the meaning of the term [...] "New Age" [...] changed; whereas it had once referred specifically to a coming era, at this point it came to be used in a wider sense to refer to a variety of spiritual activities <b>and</b> <b>practices.</b> <b>In</b> {{the latter part of the}} 1970s, the New Age expanded to cover a wide variety of alternative spiritual and religious beliefs and practices, not all of which explicitly held to the belief in the Age of Aquarius, but which were nevertheless widely recognised as being broadly similar in their search for [...] "alternatives" [...] to mainstream society.

500|$|Lang was {{supportive}} of the Malines Conversations of 1921–26, though not directly involved. [...] These were informal meetings between leading British Anglo-Catholics and reform-minded European Roman Catholics, exploring the possibility of reuniting the Anglican and Roman communions. Although the discussions had the blessing of Randall Davidson, the Archbishop of Canterbury, many Anglican evangelicals were alarmed by them. Ultimately, the talks foundered on the entrenched opposition of the Catholic ultramontanes. A by-product of these conversations {{may have been the}} awakening of opposition to the revision of the Anglican Prayer Book. The focus of this revision, which Lang supported, was to make concessions to Anglo-Catholic rituals <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> <b>in</b> the Anglican service. The new Prayer Book was overwhelmingly approved by the Church's main legislative body, the Church Assembly, and by the House of Lords. Partly through the advocacy of the fervently evangelical Home Secretary, Sir William Joynson-Hicks, the revision was twice defeated in the House of Commons, in December 1927 by 238 votes to 205 and, in June 1928, by 266 to 220. Lang was deeply disappointed, writing that [...] "the gusts of Protestant convictions, suspicions, fears [...] prejudices swept through the House, and ultimately prevailed." ...|$|E
