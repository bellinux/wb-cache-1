5|$|As John Wilson {{and others}} have noted, it is {{difficult}} to define leisure. Its definitions are numerous and often mutually contradictory, for example as a discrete portion of one's time or as <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> experience irrespective of time. Joffre Dumazedier distinguished four distinct definitions of leisure, which begin broadly and gradually narrow in scope. The first and broadest defines leisure as a style of behavior that may occur even at work, the second defines it as any non-work activity; the third further excludes family and household obligations; and, finally, the narrowest defines leisure as activities dedicated to self-fulfillment. Dumazedier's four definitions are not exhaustive. Incompatible definitions and measures are seen as a major factor accounting for occasionally contradictory research findings.|$|E
5|$|Pillars are a {{major part}} of Western Chalukya {{architecture}} and were produced in two main types: pillars with alternate square blocks and a sculptured cylindrical section with a plain square-block base, and bell-shaped lathe-turned pillars. The former type is more vigorous and stronger than the bell-shaped type, which is made of soapstone and has <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> its own. Inventive workmanship was used on soapstone shafts, roughly carved into the required shapes using a lathe. Instead of laboriously rotating a shaft to obtain the final finish, workers added the final touches to an upright shaft by using sharp tools. Some pillars were left unpolished, as evidenced by the presence of fine grooves made by the pointed end of the tool. In other cases, polishing resulted in pillars with fine reflective properties such as the pillars in the temples at Bankapura, Itagi and Hangal. This pillar art reached its zenith in the temples at Gadag, specifically the Sarasvati Temple in Gadag city.|$|E
5|$|The founders' {{ambition}} was {{to build}} an orchestra the equal of any European or American rival. Between 1932 and the Second World War the LPO was widely judged to have succeeded in this regard. After the outbreak of war the orchestra's private backers withdrew and the players reconstituted the LPO as a self-governing cooperative. In the post-war years the orchestra faced challenges from two new rivals; the Philharmonia and the Royal Philharmonic, founded respectively in 1946 and 1947, achieved <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> playing not matched by the older orchestras, including the LPO.|$|E

25|$|However, {{this shift}} was gradual {{and would not}} become {{immediately}} apparent until the Enlightenment. By the 18th century and the Age of Enlightenment, mention of creativity (notably in aesthetics), linked {{with the concept of}} imagination, became more frequent. In the writing of Thomas Hobbes, imagination became a key element of human cognition; William Duff {{was one of the first}} to identify imagination as <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> genius, typifying the separation being made between talent (productive, but breaking no new ground) and genius.|$|E
25|$|Numerous Sufi traditions place {{emphasis}} upon a meditative procedure {{which comes from}} the cognitive aspect {{to one of the}} two principal approaches {{to be found in the}} Buddhist traditions: that of the concentration technique, involving high-intensity and sharply focused introspection. In the Oveyssi-Shahmaghsoudi Sufi order, for example, this is particularly evident, where muraqaba takes the form of tamarkoz, the latter being a Persian term that means concentration. Meditative quiescence is said to have <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> healing, and—in contemporary terminology—enhancing creativity.|$|E
25|$|Another {{problem in}} {{describing}} vocal sound {{lies in the}} vocal vocabulary itself. There are many schools of thought within vocal pedagogy and different schools have adopted different terms, sometimes from other artistic disciplines. This {{has led to the}} use of a plethora of descriptive terms applied to the voice which are not always understood to mean the same thing. Some terms sometimes used to describe <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> a voice's sound are: warm, white, dark, light, round, reedy, spread, focused, covered, swallowed, forward, ringing, hooty, bleaty, plummy, mellow, pear-shaped, and so forth.|$|E

25|$|The Futurist and constructivist {{architectural}} movements, and the dada anti-art movement were occurring concurrently to expressionism {{and often}} contained similar features. Bruno Taut's magazine, Frülicht included constructivist projects, including Vladimir Tatlins Monument to the Third International. However, futurism and constructivism emphasized mechination, and urbanism tendencies {{which were not}} to take hold in Germany until the Neue Sachlichkeit. Mendelsohn is an exception whose work bordered on futurism and constructivism. <b>A</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> dynamic energy and exuberance exists in both the sketches of Erich Mendelsohn and futurist Antonio Sant'Elia. The Merzbau by Dada artist Kurt Schwitters, with its angular, abstract form, held many expressionist characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Diamond clarity is <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> {{diamonds}} {{relating to}} the existence and visual appearance of internal characteristics of a diamond called inclusions, and surface defects called blemishes. Clarity {{is one of the}} four Cs of diamond grading, the others being carat, color, and cut. Inclusions may be crystals of a foreign material or another diamond crystal, or structural imperfections such as tiny cracks that can appear whitish or cloudy. The number, size, color, relative location, orientation, and visibility of inclusions can all affect the relative clarity of a diamond. A clarity grade is assigned based on the overall appearance of the stone under ten times magnification.|$|E

25|$|Following Husserl, Sartre views absurdity as <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> all {{existing}} objects (and of {{the material}} world collectively), independent of any stance humans might take with respect to them. Our consciousness of an object does not inhere in the object itself. Thus in the early portions of the novel, Roquentin, who takes no attitude towards objects and has no stake in them, is totally estranged from the world he experiences. The objects themselves, in their brute existence, have only participation in a meaningless flow of events: they are superfluous. This alienation from objects casts doubt for him, in turn, on his own validity and even his own existence.|$|E
25|$|A {{different}} type of experiment concerned the improvement of project management, switching from a single-building to a multi-block project scale. This was tested in the Peschanaya Square development (a territory north from the 1948 Posokhin-Lagutenko block). Using the flow methode of moving crews through a sequence of buildings in different completion stages and a moderate application of prefabricated concrete on otherwise traditional masonry, builders managed to complete typical 7-story buildings in 5–6 months. Instead of wet-stucco (which caused at least two months of delay), these buildings are finished with open brickwork outside, and a drywall inside; and from <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life consideration, these are true – and the last – Stalinist buildings.|$|E
25|$|The pendopo of a Kalang {{house is}} still kept as the {{reception}} area of the house. However, instead of employing a traditional joglo-styled roof typical of a traditional pendopo, the roof often employs additional front-facing gable, marking the front-center part of the pendopo. Omah Prayadranan or Ndalem Natan (1857 or 1927) in Kotagede, and a Kalang house in Jalan Slamet Riyadi, Surakarta, employs a porch-like protrusion to the pendopo, known as the kuncungan. The kuncungan of a Kalang house in Jalan Urip Sumoharjo, Surakarta has transformed into a porte-cochère while the pendopo took form of a terrace. The kalang house of B.H. Noeriah, or Omah Tembong (1862) has been completely enclosed with wall, stained glassed windows and door, giving it <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> a sunroom.|$|E

Method: A total of 574 10 - to 14 - year-olds filled out questionnaires on parent-child relationship quality, sibling relationship quality and externalizing and internalizing problem behaviour. Results: Results showed a significant effect between <b>a</b> low <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> affective parent-child relationship and <b>a</b> low <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> sibling relationship {{on the one hand}} and increase in both externalising and internalising problem behaviour on the other hand. For high quality parent-child and sibling relationships this significant effect on either forms of problem behaviour was not found. Conclusions: <b>A</b> low affective <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the parent-child relationship and low <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the sibling relationship were found to be risk-factors for externalizing and internalizing problem behaviour. <b>A</b> high <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> both relationships was not found to be a protective factor for externalizing and internalizing problem behaviour...|$|R

Unbeknownst to them, the captain of the ship had asked the ship chandler to deliver ethanol for the ship's medical kit, but had rejected the suspicious-looking bottles because they had no prints proving that the content was suitable for medical use. Instead of 90–95% ethanol spirit the liquid in the bottles contained 36% of methanol, and four of the seven crew members involved in the party {{died as a result of}} methanol poisoning.|$|E
25|$|Scuba skills {{training}} is primarily provided by practical instruction {{under the guidance}} of a registered or certified diving instructor, {{on the assumption that the}} instructor is both competent and willing to provide <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> training and assessment according to the relevant training standards, and to ensure that the learner is competent according to the assessment criteria applied. Additional practice of the skills is the responsibility of the diver, and is generally necessary to reach and retain a level of competence sufficient to deal with the foreseeable contingencies which may occur during diving under the range of conditions in which the diver is certified to dive. Recreational divers may attend refresher courses when they have not dived for a significant period, in which the instructor ensures that they are still competent in the skills required by their certification, and it is not uncommon for service providers like dive shops and charter boats to require a checkout dive from divers unfamiliar with the region, or unable to show sufficient evidence of adequate current skill level. The checkout dive is usually a demonstration by the diver of basic skills appropriate to the expected conditions, and may be assessed by an instructor or divemaster. These refresher courses and checkout dives are usually informal, and may vary considerably.|$|E
