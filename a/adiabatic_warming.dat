Including a finite ion temperature is especially important when the wave frequency is just above the local lower hybrid resonance frequency. For wave frequencies more than approximate to 1 kHz above the local lower hybrid resonance frequency, including the ion temperature has a negligible effect on the refractive index surface calculation. The results are used to assess previous conclusions on whether in situ whistler mode sources can be realistically used to precipitate energetic electrons.

A compositional parameter space has been drawn which shows the nature of existence and the polarity of dust ion acoustic solitary structures at the acoustic speed. This compositional parameter space clearly indicates the regions for the existence of positive and negative potential dust ion acoustic solitary structures. Again, this compositional parameter space shows that the present system supports the negative potential double layer at the acoustic speed along a particular curve in the parametric plane. However, the negative potential double layer is unable to restrict the occurrence of all negative potential solitary waves. As a result, in a particular region of the parameter space, there exist negative potential solitary waves after the formation of negative potential double layer. But the amplitudes of these supersolitons are bounded. A finite jump between amplitudes of negative potential solitons separated by the negative potential double layer has been observed, and consequently, the present system supports the supersolitons at the acoustic speed in a neighbourhood of the curve along which negative potential double layer exist. The effects of the parameters on the amplitude of the solitary structures at the acoustic speed have been discussed.

This area has some char-acteristics that set it apart from other regions of the atmosphere. Most notably, it is the altitude region with the lowest overall temperature and has the unique characteristic that the temperature is much lower in summer than in winter. The summer-to-winter-tem-perature gradient is the result of <b>adiabatic</b> cooling and <b>warming</b> associated with a vigorous circulation driven primarily by gravity waves. Tides and planetary waves also contribute to the circulation and to the large dynamical variability in the MLT. The past decade has seen much progress in describing and understanding the dynamics of the MLT and the inter-actions of dynamics with chemistry and radiation. This review describes recent observa-tions and numerical modeling as they relate to understanding the dynamical processes that control the MLT and its variability. Results from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM), which is a comprehensive high-top general circulation model with interactive chemistry, are used to illustrate the dynamical processes. Selected observations from the Sounding the Atmosphere with Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument are shown for comparison. WACCM simulations of MLT dynamics have some differences with observations.

Using Pseudo-potential method an energy integral equation is derived for the system. The latter is analysed {{to examine the}} existence regions of the solitary waves. It is found that negative ion concentration (α), spectral index (k) and ionic temperature ratio (σ 1 or σ 2) significantly influence the characteristic of the solitons. Our numerical analysis shows that the system also supports rarefactive solitons for some selected set of plasma parameters. It is also found that large amplitude ion-acoustic compressive and rarefactive solitons exist simultaneously for the same values of plasma parameters. Further {{an increase in the}} superthermality (i. e. decreasing the value of spectral index k) leads to shrinking the existing domain of the large amplitude ion-acoustic solitons. The amplitude of the compressive/rarefactive solitons increases with the increase in negative ion concentration (α).

The effect of negative-ion concentration (α), temperature ratio of two ion species (σ 1 and σ 2), Mach number (M) and spectral index (k) on the characteristics of solitons are discussed in detail.

Thermodynamic and dynamic processes during Anita's lifecycle are investigated using the heat and vorticity budget equations. The cyclone developed with hybrid characteristics and moved anomalously to the southwest where it coupled with an upper level cut-off low during the mature phase. This coupling was the main dynamical mechanism for further cyclone deepening. Anita then remained quasi-stationary about 30. S - 47. W for two days due to an upper level dipole pattern which prevented earlier displacement of the upper level low counterpart. When the dipole pattern dissipated, the cyclone moved southeast and underwent extratropical transition whilst merging with a mid-latitude frontal cyclone. Diabatic heating and horizontal temperature advection are found to be essential for the subtropical development. During extratropical transition, it is instead diabatic cooling together with <b>adiabatic</b> cooling and <b>warm</b> air advection that act as the main mechanisms to influence the local temperature tendencies at low levels. Low level cyclonic tendencies were mostly due to convergent flow, and the residual vorticity partially destroyed the vorticity tendencies produced by the divergence term.

40|$|A thermal {{equilibrium}} theory of periodically focused charged-particle beams {{is presented in}} the framework of both warm-fluid and kinetic descriptions. In particular, the thermal beam equilibria are discussed for paraxial beams in periodic solenoidal and quadrupole magnetic focusing fields, and the theory is compared with the experimental measurements. A warm-fluid equilibrium theory for a thermal beam in a periodic solenoidal focusing field is presented. The warm-fluid beam equilibrium equations are solved in the paraxial approximation, and the beam density and flow velocity are obtained. The self-consistent root-mean-square (rms) beam envelope equation and the self-consistent Poisson equation, governing the beam density and potential distributions, are derived. The beam equilibrium is adiabatic, i. e., there is no heat flow in the system, which results in rms beam emittance being conserved. The beam temperature is constant across the cross-section of the beam. For high-intensity beams, the beam density profile is flat {{in the center of the}} beam and falls off rapidly within a few Debye lengths at the edge of the beam. Such density profile provides a more realistic representation of a laboratory beam than the uniform density profile in the Kapchinskij-Vladimirskij beam equilibrium which had been used in experimental data analyses. A kinetic equilibrium theory for the thermal beam in the periodic solenoidal focusing field, which is equivalent to the warm-fluid equilibrium theory, is also presented. The Hamiltonian for single-particle motion is analyzed to find the approximate and exact invariants of motion, i. e., a scaled transverse Hamiltonian (nonlinear space charge included) and the angular momentum, from which a Maxwell-Boltzmann-like beam equilibrium distribution is constructed. (cont.) The approximation of the scaled transverse Hamiltonian as an invariant of motion is validated analytically for highly emittancedominated beams and highly space-charge-dominated beams, and numerically tested to be valid for cases in between with moderate vacuum phase advances ([sigma]v, < 90 °). The beam envelope and emittances are determined self-consistently with the beam equilibrium distribution. A warm-fluid equilibrium theory for a thermal beam in a periodic quadrupole magnetic (AG) focusing field is presented. The beam equilibrium is <b>adiabatic.</b> The <b>warm</b> 3 fluid beam equilibrium equations are solved in the paraxial approximation. The rms beam envelope equations and the self-consistent Poisson equation, governing the beam density and potential distributions, are derived. It is shown numerically that the equilibrium equipotential contours and constant density contours are ellipses. Because the thermal beam equilibrium is adiabatic, the 4 D thermal rms emittance of the beam is conserved. For high-intensity beams, the beam density profile is flat in the center of the beam and falls off rapidly within a few Debye lengths, which is similar to the beam density profile in the periodic solenoidal focusing field. An interesting property of the equilibrium is that the rate at which the density falls is transversely isotropic. Quantitative comparisons are made between the {{thermal equilibrium}} theories and recent experiments at the University of Maryland Electron Ring [S. Bernal, B. Quinn, M. Reiser and P. G. O'Shea, Phys. Rev. Special Topics - Accel. Beams 5, 064202 (2002); S. Bernal, R. A. Kishek, M. Reiser, and I. Haber, Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 4002 (1999) ]. In the case of the periodic solenoidal focusing experiment, good agreement is found between theory and the experimental measurements from the anode aperture to a distance prior to wave breaking. (cont.) In the case of the AG focusing experiment, there is reasonably good agreement between the theoretical and experimentally measured density profiles in one transverse direction along which the beam is close to equilibrium. by Ksenia R.
