5|$|According to Hepburn (2006, pp.238–239), “it {{should be}} {{expected}} that industry will lobby furiously against any auctioning.” Hepburn et al. (2006) state that it is <b>an</b> <b>empirical</b> fact that while businesses tend to oppose auctioning of emissions permits, economists almost uniformly recommend auctioning permits. Garnaut notes that the complexity of free allocation, and the {{large amounts of money}} involved, encourage non-productive rent-seeking behaviour and lobbying of governments, activities that dissipate economic value.|$|E

5|$|Gray and Joseph Dalton Hooker went {{to visit}} Richard Owen at London's Hunterian Museum in January 1839. Gray met Charles Darwin during lunch that day at Kew Gardens, {{apparently}} introduced by Hooker. Darwin found a kindred spirit in Gray, as they both had <b>an</b> <b>empirical</b> approach to science, and first wrote to him in April 1855. During 1855–1881 they exchanged about 300 letters. Darwin then wrote to Gray requesting information about the distribution of various species of American flowers, which Gray provided, and which was helpful {{for the development of}} Darwin's theory. This was the beginning of an extensive lifelong correspondence.|$|E
5|$|It {{is largely}} <b>an</b> <b>empirical</b> procedure, {{and has a}} {{reasonable}} safety record {{within the scope of}} its intended application. Advantages are reduced overall decompression time and for some versions, easy estimation of decompression by the use of a simple rule-based procedure which can be done underwater by the diver. It requires the use of specific gas mixtures for given depth ranges. The advantages claimed are flexibility in that if the depth is not known accurately, the schedule can be adjusted during the dive to allow for the actual depth, and that it allows deep dives without the use of an expensive trimix dive computer.|$|E

Meta-regression analysis (MRA) is meta-econometrics, uses the very tools that produce economics research, and provides a rigorous, objective alternative to conventional narrative reviews in economics. MRA often reveals surprising truths about economics.
