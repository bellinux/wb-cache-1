5|$|Furthermore, while patriarchal {{marriages are}} one of the great wrongs perpetrated upon women, Wollstonecraft <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> greater wrong is women's lack of independence. Because they are unable to find respectable, well-paid work, they are reliant upon men. Women such as Jemima are reduced to hard {{physical}} labor, stealing, begging, or prostituting themselves in order to survive; they are demeaned by this work and think meanly of themselves because of it.|$|E
5|$|The village {{name has}} been spelt in {{different}} ways, including: Bentewurda or Bintewurda (12th century) and Bynteworth (c. 15th century). The original meaning of the name Bent-worth {{may have been a}} place of cultivated land, or a way through land such as woodland. The Swedish scholar Eilert Ekwall <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> derivation from the Old English bent-grass is unlikely, and suggests a derivation from The tũn of Bynna's people.|$|E
5|$|Driessen explores ways {{in which}} nonhuman animals might be {{understood}} to be engaging in political deliberation. His claim is empirical rather than normative, as he presents nonhuman animals as already being in political dialogue with humans; rather than arguing that rights should be extended to animals, he calls for a recognition of how interactions with animals have always been political. This is particularly noticeable, he argues, when humans {{are involved in the}} development of new technologies, analysing the example (following Bruno Latour) of Gaston Lagaffe building a door in dialogue with his boss and the office cat, and of farmers and cows using milking robots. He <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> recognition of this animal deliberation can lead to more thoughtful forms of both environmentalism and democracy.|$|E

5|$|Some {{evidence}} suggests that Lithuanians began combining their forces {{at the dawn of}} the 13th century. For example, in 1207, soldiers were recruited across Lithuania to fight the German religious orders, and in 1212, Daugirutis' treaty with Novgorod shows that he exerted some degree of influence over a vast area. During the first twenty years of the 13th century, Lithuanians organized some thirty military expeditions to Livonia, Russia, and Poland. Historian Tomas Baranauskas <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> Lithuanian state could be said to exist as early as 1183.|$|E
5|$|Though Haley is ostensibly a ghostwriter on the Autobiography, modern {{scholars}} tend {{to treat}} him as an essential and core collaborator who acted as an invisible figure {{in the composition of}} the work. He minimized his own voice, and signed a contract to limit his authorial discretion in favor of producing what looked like verbatim copy. However, MalcolmX biographer Manning Marable considers this view of Haley as simply a ghostwriter as a deliberate narrative construction of black scholars of the day who wanted to see the book as a singular creation of a dynamic leader and martyr. Marable <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> critical analysis of the Autobiography, or the full relationship between MalcolmX and Haley, does not support this view; he describes it instead as a collaboration.|$|E
5|$|James Campbell refutes {{suggestions}} that the hides given for each tribe were {{the sum of}} a system of locally-collected assessments and <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> two-tier system of assessment, one for large areas such as kingdoms and a more accurate one for individual estates, may have existed. He considers the possibility that many of the tribes named in the Tribal Hidage were no more than administrative units and that some names did not originate from a tribe itself but from a place from where the people were governed, eventually coming to signify the district where the tribe itself lived. Barbara Yorke suggests that the -sætan/sæte form of several of the place-names are an indication that they were named after a feature of the local landscape. She also suggests the tribes were dependent administrative units and not independent kingdoms, some of which were created as such after the main kingdoms were stabilized.|$|E

5|$|Philosopher Onora O'Neill, {{who studied}} under John Rawls at ￼Harvard University, is a {{contemporary}} Kantian ethicist who supports a Kantian approach {{to issues of}} social justice. O'Neill <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> successful Kantian account of social justice must not rely on any unwarranted idealizations or assumption. She notes that philosophers have previously charged Kant with idealizing humans as autonomous beings, without any social context or life goals, though maintains that Kant's ethics can be read without such an idealization. O'Neill prefers Kant's conception of reason as practical and available {{to be used by}} humans, rather than as principles attached to every human being. Conceiving of reason as a tool to make decisions with means that the only thing able to restrain the principles we adopt is that they could be adopted by all. If we cannot will that everyone adopts a certain principle, then we cannot give them reasons to adopt it. To use reason, and to reason with other people, we must reject those principles that cannot be universally adopted. In this way, O'Neill reached Kant's formulation of universalisability without adopting an idealistic view of human autonomy. This model of universalisability does not require that we adopt all universalisable principles, but merely prohibits us from adopting those that are not.|$|E
