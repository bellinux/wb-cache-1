40|$|Abstract- Mobile {{computing}} {{is the way}} of the future, as evident by such initiatives as Bluetooth, Iceberg and HomeRF. However, for {{mobile computing}} to be successful, an obvious layer, the MAC layer, must be efficient in channel <b>access</b> <b>and</b> <b>reservation.</b> Therefore, in-depth understanding is needed of the wireless MAC ' layer if wireless computing is to takeoff. Many random access wireless MAC protocols have been proposed and standardized. However, there has yet been an attempt to understand why certain designs are used and what makes certain protocols better than others. In this paper, we survey several popular, contemporary, wireless, random access MAC protocols and determine the effects behind the design choices of these protocols. 1...|$|E
30|$|The BB {{protocol}} {{relies on}} the assumption that AP α and AP β do not check (13) simultaneously. If both AP α and AP β were to sense the channel simultaneously, they would both infer that the channel is free, since there is no pre-established receiver in the vicinity that announces its presence by emitting a BB signal. In such scenario, they would both schedule transmission for their own users without any knowledge of the user the other AP might schedule. Hence, each of the APs can potentially cause severe CCI to the user served by the other AP. Such collision can potentially cause high outage particularly at the cell-edge. To mitigate such problem, the cellular slot <b>access</b> <b>and</b> <b>reservation</b> (CESAR) approach [21] is used, which ensures that an idle chunk is not assigned simultaneously by neighbouring APs through a cyclic shifted allocation pattern for idle chunks.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a dynamic {{reservation}} protocol {{for the low}} earth orbit (LEO) mobile satellite system. Based on an analytical model, the dynamic reservation protocol enhances system performance by dynamically varying both the <b>access</b> probability <b>and</b> <b>reservation</b> bandwidth. To implement the protocol, a novel contention-pattern-analysis method is proposed to estimate the number of contending terminals {{at the start of}} a frame. The reservation protocol is employed to integrate connection-oriented and connectionless traffic over a satellite channel. Simulation and theoretical results are presented to analyze the performance of the protocol and illustrate its benefits. Department of Computin...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFilter Bank MultiCarrier {{modulation}} (FBMC) is {{a promising}} waveform technology envisaged for future mobile communication networks. For many transmission scenarios, {{the combination of}} multiple non-contiguous spectrum bands is foreseen. Because of coexistence issues, very low Adjacent Channel Leakage is required making FBMC waveforms of particular interest. However the fair frequency localization of FBMC results in a time spreading of the waveform: the filter impulse response introduces transitions which increase {{the duration of the}} burst with respect to classical multicarrier schemes such as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing and may reduce the overall spectral efficiency. In this work, we propose to study the performance of a FBMC waveform considering Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance. Two mechanisms are employed for packet transmission: a basic <b>access</b> <b>and</b> a <b>reservation</b> scheme (based on RTS/CTS). We study how effective the RTS/CTS handshake is under ideal channel conditions by taking into account the specificities of the FBMC physical layer. Furthermore, we discuss about the RTS threshold value on packet size that maximizes throughput performance by employing one of both possible schemes and the impact of subchannel aggregation strategies on throughput and latency...|$|R
30|$|Academically and practically, {{this paper}} {{provides}} several implications. First, developing and expanding a well-developed medical travel procedure based on patients’ experiences {{is a prerequisite}} for successful medical tourism. Such decision-making process could be measured by integrating three types of customer experience to enhance customer satisfaction. Because many hospitals and travel agencies are striving to develop new protocols using advanced technologies, the proposed model should be easy to <b>access</b> <b>and</b> the <b>reservation</b> process should be simple. For example, a one-stop service system can help with travel arrangements, arrange airport pick up and local transportation, hotel recommendations, ancillary services at the hospital, scheduling tours to selected destinations, coordinating with insurance companies, and assisting with other paper work. To build an effective medical travel process for patients, healthcare facilities and travel facilitators must fulfill their promises. In other words, the promised services and costs should be provided without fail. For example, policymakers should ensure that the standard model of medical tourism include internationally accepted standardized care processes and insurance. The qualification criteria for medical tourism agents/brokers should be developed and enforced globally. Since customers from various countries visit a hospital, to overcome barriers to global medical tourism, the use of standardized communication devices should be available for customer convenience.|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, we took {{a closer}} look at the Red Pitaya {{measurement}} system with some of its basic tools. We developed a Remote Access Server for <b>access,</b> <b>reservation</b> <b>and</b> control of Red Pitaya systems. We integrated the existing Red Pitaya's SCPI server into the remote <b>access</b> server <b>and</b> added a feature for writing small SCPI compatible programs. We developed a program for accessing FPGA registers on the Red Pitaya, and integrated it with our remote access server. In the scope of this project we also created a simple Red Pitaya application on the base of existing Red Pitaya's Oscilloscope and Generator frameworks. We added a basic feature for turning on and off LED diodes, and a feature for saving data about acquired signals, which can be viewed and deleted remotely. The server also supports adding users and Red Pitaya measurement systems to the database. At the end, we explained how to use Nginx to deploy our application...|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} {{personal}} communication networks {{will depend on}} their ability to accommodate the diverse traffic which will be generated from the numerous and diverse future multimedia applications and services. Towards this end, multimedia Medium access control (MAC) algorithms capable of accommodating this integrated traffic will play a major role. In this thesis, novel MAC protocols are proposed and their ability to efficiently utilize the available bandwidth is evaluated. The proposed multimedia MAC protocols are based on random <b>access</b> algorithms <b>and</b> <b>reservation</b> policies using TDM and CDMA technologies. The MAC protocols also support multiple-priority mechanisms: an essential feature in communication systems supporting integrated services with diverse Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. One of the major characteristics of the priority mechanism is its simplicity of implementation. This adds to the practical value of the proposed MAC protocols. The TDMA and the CDMA versions of the protocols are evaluated for voice and data traffic and compared to other MACs proposed in the literature. The CDMA version of the protocol is also investigated for data, voice and video with multi-slot reservation for video. Network configurations servicing CBR (variable quality) and VBR (constant quality) video users are evaluated. The results verified the superiority of the proposed protocol: high school utilization and ability to service effectively high volumes of integrated traffic. The new MACs are found to be stable, robust and easy to implement multimedia services in personal communication networks. The simplicity and high performance level of the proposed MACs makes it valuable for supporting integrated traffic wireless applications...|$|R

40|$|Convergence {{of mobile}} communications, {{computing}} and Internet {{is on the}} way. This will be the driving force towards a wireless multimedia society in 21 st century. Unfortunately, since the present mobile communication systems (often referred to as 2 G systems) are optimized to real-time voice services, they have quite limited capabilities in providing broadband multimedia services because of their slow data transfer rates and small displays on the portable phones. The IMT- 2000 systems [1], [2] called the 3 rd generation (3 G) systems, are under deployment in Japan with much faster data rate of 384 kbps and better representation than present 2 G systems. We are now entering into wideband era. However, the capabilities of 3 G systems will sooner or later be insufficient {{to cope with the}} everincreasing demands for broadband multimedia communications. Broadband multimedia services will soon be in full force in fixed networks based on the next generation Internet technology. Information transferred over the Internet will become increasingly rich. It is expected that the 4 G systems should emerge around 2010; a major objective is to offer mobile users with broadband multimedia services. Demands will become stronger and stronger for downloading of ever increasing volumes of information. Giga-bit wireless technology (up to 1 G bps) will be required that is optimized to broadband IP packet transport over the air. For wireless <b>access,</b> a random <b>and</b> <b>reservation</b> packet <b>access</b> <b>and</b> flexible wireless resource assignment between forward and reverse links will be required.

40|$|In this paper, three {{innovative}} car-sharing {{systems for}} urban areas are proposed, based on fleets of individual intelligent vehicles with three service characteristics: instant <b>access,</b> open-ended <b>reservations</b> <b>and</b> one-way trips. These features provide high flexibility but create an uneven distribution of vehicles among stations. Therefore, relocation of vehicles must be performed. Three different system procedures are proposed: {{in the first}} system, relocations are performed by users; in the other two, vehicles relocate automatically, thanks to their automation. In the first two systems, vehicles are accessible only at stations, whereas in the third they are also accessible along roads. In order to provide transport managers with a tool to test systems in different realities, an object-oriented simulator is developed. The simulation provides outputs of system performance, in terms of user waiting times and system efficiency. The proposed systems are simulated {{for the city of}} Genoa, in Italy, and a comparative analysis is presented. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis...|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that random multiple-access {{protocols}} present instability problems. The authors consider an approach that provides for stability and is of an adaptive nature. The basic idea is to alternate CSMA(/CD) <b>and</b> <b>reservation</b> TDMA periods. The operation of the CSMA(/CD) protocol is interrupted {{once in a while}} so that a reservation TDMA epoch can start. Several criteria which may be used to define switching rules from CSMA(/CD) periods to reservation TDMA periods are also examined. In this way, a range of mixed adaptive protocols can be constructed. Analytical models for their description are presented, and the performance of different protocol families is compared with that of the pure CSMA(/CD) <b>and</b> <b>reservation</b> TDMA. Due to their adaptive properties, the proposed protocols present very good throughput-delay characteristics, that is, they exhibit low <b>access</b> time <b>and</b> high channel utilization...|$|R
30|$|The {{geometrical}} {{characteristics of the}} route condition {{the course of a}} vehicle on the line: the shape, contours and curves (profile in length) and local irregularities (profile in width) condition the movement of the vehicle, its accelerations and decelerations and cruising speed. Beyond the ideal kinetic characteristics of an “isolated” vehicle, the infrastructure is influenced by traffic of different kinds and other disruptive influences. The vehicle’s progress can be delayed by other vehicles belonging to the same service, or by other vehicles sharing the lane or tracks on a non segregated infrastructure. Segregated lanes or tracks can be used to exclude vehicles external to the line. However, traffic can also be disrupted by intersections with other flows of traffic, belonging to the same mode or to others (in particular pedestrians), or by disturbances of an external nature (weather, obstructions, etc.): the subway is the mode with the fewest constraints, as it intersects exclusively with passengers boarding and alighting in the station. Route management covers (i) the definition of the route, (ii) interaction management by means of <b>access</b> <b>reservation</b> <b>and</b> intersection management, (iii) the control of each vehicle to match the particular conditions of the run.|$|R
