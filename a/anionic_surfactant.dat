[...] It is an <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> used in many cleaning and hygiene products. The sodium salt is of an organosulfate class of organics. It consists of a 12-carbon tail attached to a sulfate group, that is, it is the sodium salt of dodecyl hydrogen sulfate, the ester of dodecyl alcohol and sulfuric acid. Its hydrocarbon tail combined with a polar [...] "headgroup" [...] give the compound amphiphilic properties and so make it useful as a detergent. [...] Also derived {{as a component of}} mixtures produced from inexpensive coconut and palm oils, SDS is a common component of many domestic cleaning, personal hygiene and cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and food products, as well as of industrial and commercial cleaning and product formulations.|$|E

5000|$|Surfactants are {{classified}} into four main types, each with different properties and applications: anionic, cationic, nonionic and zwitterionic (or amphoteric). <b>Anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> are compounds that contain an anionic polar group. Examples of <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> include {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} and dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate. Included in this class of surfactants are sodium alkylcarboxylates (soaps). [...] Cationic surfactats are similar in nature to <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactants,</b> except the surfactant molecules carry a positive charge at the hydrophilic portion. Many of these compounds are quaternary ammonium salts, as well as cetrimonium bromide (CTAB). Non-ionic surfactants are non-charged and together with <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> make {{up the majority of}} oil-dispersant formulations. The hydrophilic portion of the surfactant contains polar functional groups, such as -OH or -NH. Zwitterionic surfactants are the most expensive, and are used for specific applications. These compounds have both positively and negatively charged components. An example of a zwitterionic compound is phosphatidylcholine, which as a lipid is largely insoluble in water.|$|R

50|$|After first {{acidifying}} a {{water sample}} (with boric acid, for example), one adds to it chloroform and {{a solution of}} methylene blue et al. Methylene blue is a cationic dye. The biphasic solution is then agitated to distribute these reagents throughout the aqueous and organic phases. If an <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> is present, then the cationic methylene blue and the <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> forms an ion pair, which is extracted into the organic phase. The color saturation of the chloroform increases with increasing concentration of surfactants.|$|E
50|$|Linear {{alkylbenzene}} sulfonate (LAS) {{with the}} formula of C12H25C6H4SO3Na, {{also known as}} sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate, is {{the most widely used}} <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> in laundry detergent because it has minimal environmental impact for its readily biodegradation.|$|E
50|$|Anionic, nonionic, and {{cationic}} surfactants have been used, although <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> {{are by far}} most prevalent. Surfactants with a low critical micelle concentration (CMC) are favored; the polymerization rate shows a dramatic increase when the surfactant level is above the CMC, and minimization of the surfactant is preferred for economic reasons and the (usually) adverse effect of surfactant on the physical properties of the resulting polymer. Mixtures of surfactants are often used, including mixtures of <b>anionic</b> with nonionic <b>surfactants.</b> Mixtures of cationic and <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> form insoluble salts and are not useful.|$|R

50|$|Anionic head {{groups are}} {{negatively}} charged, and {{commonly used in}} cleaning products. <b>Anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> {{can be found in}} products such as shampoos, laundry detergents, and soaps because of their ability to remove dirt from soft mediums such as fabric. <b>Anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> are easily suspended in water due to the polarity of the charged head group. However, hard water can deactivate the molecule. Some of the more commonly used anionic head groups are sulfates and ethoxylates.|$|R

40|$|Abstract <b>Anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> are {{commonly}} determined {{with the use}} of the methylene blue active substances (MBAS) standard method, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, new methods for determination of <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> are needed.

The developed method was found to be satisfactory in terms of sensitivity and precision, with a short time of analysis. The quantification limit for <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> was at 16 lg L- 1, with a relative standard deviation of 1. 3 % for a model sample and 3. 8 % for a river water sample.

40|$|<b>Anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> {{are used}} {{worldwide}} in detergent and household cleaning products. Due to their extensive use, surfactants can {{find their way}} into wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), where they may be completely or partially removed. <b>Anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> not only have adverse effects on aquatic and terrestrial environment, but also can have adverse effects on the WWTP operation and performance. <b>Anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> are the major class used in detergent formulations. Sodium Dodecylbenzene Sulphonate (SDBS) {{is a member of the}} LAS group and Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate (SDS) is a member of the Alkyl Sulphate group. This study selected SDS and SDBS as model <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> due to their widespread use. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of the presence of <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> in the influent to WWTPs on activated sludge processes. To accomplish this aim, the effect of the presence of SDS and SDBS on activated sludge oxygen uptake rate (OUR) and nitrification was assessed according to the ISO standard methods. The OUR method facilitates estimation of the effects of <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> on activated sludge microorganisms in aerobic biological treatment systems. A nitrification inhibition test was developed by International Standard Organization and has been used by many researchers for assessing the inhibitory effects of <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> on nitrifying microorganisms in activated sludge. The morphology of activated sludge flocs was also evaluated to help investigate the effect of <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> on the settling behaviour of flocs. The results indicated that the <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> SDS and SDBS have an adverse effect on the activated sludge OUR and nitrification activities. Inhibition to OUR increased from 12. 9 % to 44. 2 % for SDS concentrations from 5 to 100 mg/L, after 30 minutes of incubation. The inhibition to OUR decreased with increased incubation time to 180 minutes reaching 6 % at 5 mg/L and 27 % at 100 mg/L. SDBS showed a strong inhibitory effect on activated sludge OUR where an inhibition of 19. 8 % to 79. 1 % was measured after 30 minutes, which declined reaching 15 % to 69. 2 %, after 180 minutes, for the same concentration range. SDS and SDBS also showed an inhibitory effect on activated sludge nitrification which followed a trend that was in agreement with that observed for their inhibition to OUR. SDS and SDBS inhibition to nitrification was proportional to their initial concentrations. For example, inhibition to nitrification increased from 5. 9 % to 46. 5 % with increase SDS concentration from 5 to 100 mg/L compared with 12. 9 % to 53. 6 % for the same concentration range of SDBS. The results obtained demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of SDS and SDBS on activated sludge biological activities were intensified at low temperature, as measured in terms of OUR and nitrification. However, inhibition to nitrification decreased significantly with a temperature increase from 20 &ordm;C to 30 &ordm;C. The results showed that the presence of SDS and SDBS in the activated sludge aeration basins may lead to changes to the morphology of activated sludge flocs measured in terms of the mean projected area and perimeter...|$|R
50|$|Ammonium lauryl sulfate (ALS) is {{the common}} name for {{ammonium}} dodecyl sulfate (CH3(CH2)10CH2OSO3NH4). The molecule consists of a long nonpolar hydrocarbon chain and a polar sulfate end group, the combination of which make the material a surfactant. These two components allow the compound to dissolve among both polar and non-polar molecules. ALS is classified as an alkyl sulfate and is an <b>anionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> found primarily in shampoos and body-wash as a foaming agent. Lauryl sulfates are very high-foam surfactants that disrupt the surface tension of water in part by forming micelles around the highly polar water molecules at the surface-air interface.|$|E
