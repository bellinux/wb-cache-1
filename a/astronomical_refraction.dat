5000|$|During {{this period}} he {{published}} in the Philosophical Transactions several important memoirs, which earned for him the Copley Medal in 1814 and ensured his election as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1815. Of special importance {{in the history of}} attractions is the first of these earlier memoirs (Phil. Trans., 1809), in which the problem of the attraction of a homogeneous ellipsoid upon an external point is reduced to the simpler case of the attraction of another but related ellipsoid upon a corresponding point interior to it. This theorem is known as Ivory's theorem. He also published anonymously an edition of Euclid's Elements, which was described as having brought the difficult problems [...] "more within the reach of ordinary understandings." [...] His later papers in the Philosophical Transactions treat of <b>astronomical</b> <b>refractions,</b> of planetary perturbations, of equilibrium of fluid masses, etc. For his investigations in the first named of these he received a royal medal in 1826 and again in 1839.|$|R
50|$|<b>Astronomical</b> or {{celestial}} <b>refraction</b> causes <b>astronomical</b> {{objects to}} appear {{higher in the}} sky {{than they are in}} reality. Terrestrial refraction usually causes terrestrial objects to appear higher than they actually are, although in the afternoon when the air near the ground is heated, the rays can curve upward making objects appear lower than they really are.|$|R

50|$|In De refractionibus astronomicis, Oriani {{showed that}} <b>astronomical</b> <b>refraction</b> could be {{expanded}} {{as a series}} of odd powers of (tan Z), where Z is the observed zenith distance. Such a series had previously been derived by J. H. Lambert, who dropped all but the first term. However, Oriani investigated the higher terms, and he found that neither of the first two terms depended on the structure of the atmosphere.|$|E
5000|$|Young {{distinguished}} several {{regions where}} different methods for calculating <b>astronomical</b> <b>refraction</b> were applicable. In the upper {{portion of the}} sky, with a zenith distance of less than 70° (or an altitude over 20°), various simple refraction formulas based on the index of refraction (and hence on the temperature, pressure, and humidity) at the observer are adequate. Between 20° and 5° of the horizon the temperature gradient becomes the dominant factor and numerical integration, using a method {{such as that of}} Auer and Standish and employing the temperature gradient of the standard atmosphere and the measured conditions at the observer, is required. Closer to the horizon, actual measurements of the changes with height of the local temperature gradient need to be employed in the numerical integration. Below the astronomical horizon, refraction is so variable that only crude estimates of <b>astronomical</b> <b>refraction</b> can be made; for example, the observed time of sunrise or sunset can vary by several minutes from day to day. As The Nautical Almanac notes, [...] "the actual values of …the refraction at low altitudes may, in extreme atmospheric conditions, differ considerably from the mean values used in the tables." ...|$|E

Among the phenomena considered are <b>astronomical</b> and random <b>refraction,</b> scintillation, beam broadening, spatial coherence, angle of arrival, aperture averaging, absorption and scattering, {{and the effect of}} opaque clouds. An extensive reference list is also provided for further study. Useful information on the atmospheric propagation of light in relation to optical deep space communications to an earth based receiving station is available, however, further data must be generated before such a link can be designed with committed performance...|$|R

The fields of potential theory and the study of equilibrium shapes owe many key results to him. For the study of <b>astronomical</b> <b>refraction</b> he developed an unusual method of calculating the vertical gradient of air temperature together with his Assistent Felix Hausdorff. However, {{due to a lack of}} sufficiently accurate measurement methods this method has not been used in practice.|$|E

50|$|A {{posthumous work}} {{entitled}} Contemplatio Philosophica was printed for private circulation in 1793 by Taylor's grandson, Sir William Young, 2nd Bart., (d 10 January 1815) prefaced by {{a life of}} the author, and with an appendix containing letters addressed to him by Bolingbroke, Bossuet, and others. Several short papers by Taylor were published in Phil. Trans., vols. xxvii to xxxii, including accounts of some interesting experiments in magnetism and capillary attraction. In 1719 he issued an improved version of his work on perspective, with the title New Principles of Linear Perspective, revised by John Colson in 1749, and printed again, with portrait and life of the author, in 1811. A French translation was published in 1757. In Methodus Incrementorum, Taylor gave the first satisfactory investigation of <b>astronomical</b> <b>refraction.</b>|$|E
50|$|In later semesters of his studies, Hausdorff {{was close}} to Heinrich Bruns (1848-1919). Bruns was {{professor}} of astronomy {{and director of the}} observatory at the University of Leipzig. Under him, Hausdorff graduated in 1891 with a work on the theory of <b>astronomical</b> <b>refraction</b> of light in the atmosphere. Two publications on the same subject followed, and in 1895 his habilitation also followed with a thesis on the absorbance of light in the atmosphere. These early astronomical works of Hausdorff have — despite their excellent mathematical working through — not gained importance.Firstly, the underlying idea of Bruns has not proved viable (there were needs for refraction observations near the astronomical horizon, which — as Julius Bauschinger could show a little later — in principle can not be obtained with the required accuracy).On the other hand, the progress in the direct measurement of atmospheric data (weather balloon ascents) has soon made the painstaking accuracy of this data from refraction observations unnecessary. In the time between PhD and habilitation Hausdorff completed the yearlong-volunteer military requirement and worked for two years as a human computer at the observatory in Leipzig.|$|E
40|$|The <b>astronomical</b> <b>refraction</b> {{integral}} is non-convergent for {{the zenith}} distance of 90 °. The refraction determination method {{in this paper}} calculates refraction interatively, {{on the basis of}} an atmosphere model, through a direct application of refraction laws. The advantage of this method is that it can be also applied to the zenith distance of 90 °. The <b>astronomical</b> <b>refraction</b> is calculated through this method for the case in which the Earth is considered a sphere or a revolution ellipsoid. The same refraction values are obtained for the two models for zenith distances under 70 ° and slightly different values for the neighbourhood of the horizon. In the neighbourhood of the horizon, for latitudes greater than or equal with 45 °, the refraction values calculated {{in the case of the}} ellipsoidal model are greater than those for the spherical model. Key words: <b>astronomical</b> <b>refraction,</b> refraction computation at the horizon. 1...|$|E
40|$|Variations in <b>astronomical</b> <b>refraction</b> {{near the}} horizon are examined. Sunset timings, a sextant {{mounted on a}} tripod, and a {{temperature}} profile are utilized to derive the variations in refraction data, collected from 7 locations. It is determined that the refraction ranges from 0. 234 to 1. 678 deg with an rms deviation of 0. 16, and {{it is observed that}} the variation is larger than previously supposed. Some applications for the variation of refraction value are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{results are}} {{presented}} of <b>astronomical</b> <b>refraction</b> measurements for zenith distances of 80 - 90 degrees performed in different seasons with a two inch universal instrument. The differences between observed and calculated refraction were found to exhibit seasonal variations, {{and the results were}} compared with data of atmospheric aerologic soundings. The great departures in observed refraction from that calculated with the Pulkovo tables were ascribed to temperature gradient changes within the ground kilometer layer of atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|Analytical {{solutions}} to the refraction integrals appropriate for ray trajectories along slant paths through the atmosphere are derived in this paper. This type of geometry is commonly encountered in remote-sensing applications utilizing an occultation technique. The solutions are obtained by evaluating higher-order terms from expansion of the refraction integral and are dependent on the vertical temperature distributions. Refraction parameters such as total refraction angles, air masses, and path lengths can be accurately computed. It is also shown that the method {{can be used for}} computing refraction parameters in <b>astronomical</b> <b>refraction</b> geometry for large zenith angles...|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric {{refraction}} bends optical {{beams and}} lets objects appear in positions they not really are. This phenomenon {{is very important}} in astronomy. However, <b>astronomical</b> <b>refraction</b> formulas can only be used if the light source is at a very far distance from the observer. Then, atmospheric refraction mainly depends on meteorological conditions on ground. In case of optical free-space communications, the distances are comparatively short and well-known formulas for <b>astronomical</b> <b>refraction</b> are no longer sufficient. An exact knowledge {{of the structure of the}} whole atmosphere is required to assess refraction in this case. Due to the complexity of the atmosphere, analytical solutions are not possible. Hence, a numerical simulation model based on spherical symmetry, atmospheric shell modeling and standard atmosphere models was used instead. Three different categories of refraction were examined: 1) the observer is situated on ground and the object is at an altitude of at least 25 km, 2) both object and observer are below 25 km and the link path is mainly vertical and 3) both object and observer are in the stratosphere and ray paths are mainly horizontal. The results presented in this work are useful for applications like laser beam pointing and satellite tracking, UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and HAP (High Altitude Platform) downlinks or long-haul cross-links through the atmosphere, e. g. HAP-HAP or UAV-satellite...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we used the}} method of {{generator}} function to gave an improved mapping function of <b>astronomical</b> <b>refraction,</b> separately for optical and radio frequencies. We included a complete consideration of the corrections introduced by the physical and geophysical factors required in astronomy and space techniques. We used sounding balloon data to assess the actual accuracy of our corrected refraction formula. The result is 5 " at elevation 2 degrees and 1 " at elevation 5 degrees. We believe that the main factor that limits the accuracy is departure of the model atmosphere from the real atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|A new and {{flexible}} ray-tracing procedure for calculating <b>astronomical</b> <b>refraction</b> is outlined {{and applied to}} the US 1976 standard atmosphere. This atmosphere is generalized {{to allow for a}} free choice of the temperature and pressure at sea level, and in this form it has been named the modified US 1976 (MUSA 76) atmosphere. Analytical expressions and numerical procedures are presented for calculating dry-air refractions and for the water-vapor correction. Results for all apparent altitudes are presented and compared with The Star Almanac for Land Surveyors (1951), The Nautical Almanac (1958), and the Pulkovo tables (Refraction Tables of the Pulkovo Observatory, 1985). Dependences on sea-level pressure, temperature, and temperature gradient and on humidity are discussed. (C) 2003 Optical Society of America...|$|E

And a block adjustment method using average elevation is proposed directing at the specific geometric character that the base to height ratio between images is very small. The method constructs the block adjustment model based on rational function model (RFM) and the proposed block adjustment method is employed on the GF 4 patch-images without ground control, which solves the low splicing accuracy situation due to some factors, such as low orbit and attitude measurement accuracy, <b>astronomical</b> <b>refraction</b> and lens distortion etc. At last, in two experiments with GF 4 real data, it is verified that the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method, and the influence of different imagery errors compensated model is analysed also...|$|E
40|$|This article {{gives an}} exact {{expression}} for parallax adjustments to apparent ele-vation of objects at finite distances beyond the Earth atmosphere {{suitable for use}} at the very low elevation angles required by the Deep Space Network (DSN) Services Preparation Subsystem (SPS) Metric Prediction Generator (MPG). The parallax depends entirely on the <b>astronomical</b> <b>refraction</b> function and {{does not require a}} separate model, as was used in the Network Support Subsystem (NSS) Metric Pre-diction (MP) application. Rather, the effects of refraction and finite target distance are combined into a single computation. Results are compared with the parallax model used by NSS MP software, where a sizable difference at low elevation angles is noted. The NSS model is known to break down at low elevations, so this behav-ior was expected. The study also displays the performance of the method using a hybrid Lanyi/Berman–Rockwell refraction model being prepared for MPG use. I...|$|E
40|$|Several {{efforts are}} {{currently}} made from space missions {{in order to}} get accurate solar astrometric measurements i. e. to probe the long term variations of solar radius or shape, their link with solar irradiance variations and their influence on earth climate. These space missions use full disk solar imagery. In order to test our ability to perform such measurements from ground on the long term, we need to use similar techniques and instruments simultaneously from ground and space. This should help us to model and understand how the atmosphere affect ground based metrologic measurements. However, using full imagery from ground instead of the traditional astrolabe technique immediatly raise the question of the effect of refraction and how well we can correct from it. The goal is to study in details the influence of pure <b>astronomical</b> <b>refraction</b> on solar metrologic measurements made from ground-based full disk imagery and to provide the tools for correcting the measurements and estimating the associated uncertainties. We use both analytical and numerical methods in order to confront commonly or historically used approximations and exact solutions. We provide the exact formulae for correcting solar radius measurements at any heliographic angle and for any zenith distance. We show that these corrections can be applyed up to 80 degree of zenith distance provided that full numerical integration of the refraction integral is used. We also provide estimates of the absolute uncertainties associated with the differential refraction corrections and shows that approximate formulae can be used up to 80 degree of zenith distance for computing these uncertainties. For a given instrumental setup and the knowledge of the uncertainties associated with local weather records, this can be used to fix the maximum zenith distance one can observe depending on the required astrometric accuracy.
