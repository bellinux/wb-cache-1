5|$|In June 2013, Dimitri {{received}} an Email from his old friend, and former lover, Brooke English. Brooke {{was shocked when}} Dimitri responded by showing up <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>door,</b> {{and told him that}} she thought she'd never see him again. Dimitri revealed that he and Alex had divorced, and that he had not bothered remaining in touch with Edmund's family and had reverted to his reclusive ways, but that Europe was beginning to bore him and her timing couldn't have been better. Upon returning to town, he stopped by his former residence, Wildwind, only to find that the place was empty. Brooke explained that after its last occupant, Caleb Cortlandt, had moved out, Sam and Maddie, Edmund's children, had not bothered to rent the mansion out again. Dimitri told Brooke that, while at Wildwind, he stopped by the mausoleum and made amends to Edmund, who had died in a fire 8 years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{brings the}} device to the Lone Gunmen, who tell him it is {{emitting}} some kind of signal. Mulder contacts Scully, who is growing increasingly paranoid. Hearing possible clicks while {{on the phone with}} Mulder, she frantically searches her hotel room for monitoring devices. When Mulder knocks <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>door,</b> Scully fires her weapon at it and runs off. Mulder believes her to be suffering from paranoid psychosis. The Lone Gunmen believe {{the device to}} be some sort of subliminal mind control device. Mulder was not affected due to his color blindness. The police find a body they believe to be that of Scully, but Mulder confirms that it is not her. Mulder is unable to contact Scully's mother, leading him to go to her house. He finds Scully there, who aims a gun at him. Scully claims Mulder never trusted her and blames him for her abduction and her sister's murder. Scully's mother calms her down, and she is hospitalized.|$|E

As he enters to do so, {{the king and queen}} finish welcoming Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two student acquaintances of Hamlet, to Elsinore. The royal couple has requested that the students investigate the cause of Hamlet's mood and behavior. Additional news requires that Polonius wait to be heard: messengers from Norway inform Claudius that the King of Norway has rebuked Prince Fortinbras for attempting to re-fight his father's battles. The forces that Fortinbras had conscripted to march against Denmark will instead be sent against Poland, though they will pass through a portion of Denmark to get there.|$|E

5|$|An {{employee}} named Nasir (Haaz Sleiman) {{has taken}} explicit {{photos of the}} two, and Amira’s father will disown her if the father finds out. Veronica goes to a photo-developing store and retrieves the photos, but one is stuck in the printer and Nasir gets it. Amira’s father shows up <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>door</b> and angrily berates her and fires Veronica, although she says that her real employer is his wife. Keith catches Wallace and Piz, out for {{a night on the}} town, in a bar, discovering that they have high-quality fake IDs from Veronica, leading Keith to reprimand her. Veronica discovers the true vandal after tracking a piece of bait. The vandal’s name is Derrick (Cole Williams), who vandalized after seeing Nasir distributing a piece of anti-American propaganda at a mall. Both owners want to meet Derrick before pressing charges. Keith sends Piz (Chris Lowell) and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) with clearly fake IDs into a bar as a test of his subordinates. He finds that the deputy does not check closely and resents Keith as well. Due to this fact, Keith fires the people who disobeyed his orders.|$|E

She joins because Anton {{had been a member}} of the Austrian Socialist Party and he would have approved of her socializing with other members. Hilde assures Mr. Funk that she will attend the next evening social. Mr. Funk's visit forces another memory to resurface. She remembers her daughter asking what party Anton had belonged to during the period of National Socialism; Hilde recalled him being part of the Hitler Youth. The reader also discovers that Hilde's brother, Hannes, was killed by the Nazi Party. Erika's insolence upsets Hilde greatly.|$|E
25|$|Carrie, her {{obsession}} with the case renewed, ransacks Fatima's apartment and comes out with a satchel full of documents. After a pursuit by a Lebanese mob, Saul finds a hidden compartment in the satchel that it contains a memory card with Brody confessing to the aborted State Department bombing. When the mission is over, however, she realizes that {{she will not be}} permitted back into the CIA, and attempts suicide by overdosing on her medication. At the last minute, she changes her mind and vomits up the pills. Moments later, Saul shows up <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>door</b> and shows her Brody's confession. The video convinces Estes to let Carrie watch Brody, and to assign a CIA analyst named Peter Quinn (Rupert Friend) to run the operation. Quinn has Carrie meet with Brody as part of a sting operation. During the meeting, Carrie intuits that he is on to her and blows her cover by confronting Brody about his treason, forcing Saul and Quinn to arrest him.|$|E
25|$|On April 17, a Surratt {{neighbor}} told US {{military authorities}} that he overheard {{one of the}} Surratt's servants saying that three men {{had come to the}} house on the night of Lincoln's assassination and that one of the men had mentioned Booth in a theater. (The servant was mistaken about the date, as John Surratt, Jr. had indeed been in Elmira, New York, on a mission for a Confederate general). Other pieces of information also mentioned the boarding house as a key meeting place of the possible conspirators. Either Colonel Henry H. Wells, Provost Marshal (head of the military police) of the District of Columbia, or General Christopher C. Augur told Colonel Henry Steel Olcott to arrest everyone in the house. Federal soldiers visited the Surratt boarding house again late on the evening of April 17. John, Jr., could not be found, but after a search of the house, the agents found in Mary's room a picture of Booth, hidden behind another photograph, pictures of Confederate leaders including Jefferson Davis, a pistol, a mold for making bullets, and percussion caps. As Mary was being arrested for conspiracy to assassinate Lincoln, Powell appeared <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>door</b> in disguise. Although Surratt denied knowing him, Powell claimed that he was a laborer hired by Surratt to dig a ditch the next morning. The discrepancy and Powell's unusually well-groomed appearance, quite unlike a ditch-digger, prompted his arrest. He was later identified as the man who had attempted to assassinate Secretary of State William Seward.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from October 22, 1910. It states: [...] "Ellen Stokes is a loving wife and mother, but she has one fault - extravagance. On the day that her only child is playing the host at a birthday party, Ellen's husband informs her that he is practically ruined, and places the fault <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>door.</b> Ellen, conscience stricken, declares that she will aid her husband, and tells him that she will induce her rich uncle to aid them. When she talks {{to him on the}} subject, she finds that he is not disposed to aid her. Soon after his refusal, a friend of the family drops in, finds Ellen in tears, learns of her trouble, and offers a loan which she finally accepts. The woman's husband is of a jealous nature and when Ellen gives him the money, he asks if it came from the other man. She hastily denies it, and says that her uncle was the one. The husband takes the money, and later finds that his wife has deceived him. In anger he leaves the house, taking their only child with him." ...|$|E
500|$|Sandy George from Australian Screen Online {{said that}} Vidler's long {{career as an}} actor helped him [...] "draw the terrific performances" [...] from the film's young actors. 17-year-old Laurence Breuls was {{literally}} {{the first person to}} audition for the role of Jared. Hundred of others auditioned though Breuls remained the favourite choice. Vidler chose Simon Lyndon, who played the role of Jared in the original stage production of Blackrock, for the role of Ricko, stating that Lyndon had the looks, charisma, and complexity to play the role. Rebecca Smart, who also portrayed Cherie in the original stage production, was the only person to reprise their role from the play. Blackrock is often considered to be Heath Ledger's debut film, but he had an uncredited minor role in the 1991 film Clowning Around. While Ledger's role in Blackrock is small, it is credited with garnering him attention in Australia, leading to more prominent acting roles. 15-year-old Bojana Novakovic was given the role of Tracy partly because she was a competitive gymnast and was considered mentally and physically strong enough to film the rape scene. Vidler discussed the role with her parents before filming commenced, who despite initial reservations, eventually gave permission for her to film the scene. Novakovic said the experience was traumatic and she began to tremble uncontrollably once the shoot ended, though recovered shortly afterwards, concluding, [...] "In a way, I feel lucky to have had such a role at the beginning of my career. I don't think I'll ever be scared by an emotional scene again." [...] The boys involved in the scene showed up <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>door</b> the following day and gave her a bunch of flowers and a T-shirt that said [...] "shit happens". Vidler said he found the performance so powerful that when he first watched the rushes of the scene alone, he burst into tears.|$|E

2500|$|Although she {{remained}} a popular touring act, West's financial problems mounted. West and Winters {{filed for divorce}} in 1990, and he sued her for $7,500. By this time, extravagant spending {{and a string of}} bad investments by her investors had left her nearly broke. In March, her Los Angeles manager sued her for $130,000, and her former manager sued her for $110,295. Furthermore, a local bank foreclosed on her mansion outside of Nashville, and sent West an eviction notice on August 1, 1990. At this time, West owed the IRS $1.3 million and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy; she later switched to Chapter 7, which allowed her to liquidate her assets. West's fan-club president, Sandy Orwig, told The Nashville Network in a 1995 interview that according to West, the [...] "IRS would show up <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>door</b> anytime of the day or night, taking her possessions.

She also begins a romance with PC Sean McCartney (Sean Maguire). Gill reveals to Rachel that police are not pressing charges against Savage, much to Rachel's anger; she drunkenly confides to her brother about Nick Savage. Her relationship with Dominic becomes strained when he causes a small kitchen fire, though she forgives him. She later discovers him having intercourse with another man who has paid him. She advises that he have an HIV test after realising {{the extent of his}} frivolous behaviour. Meanwhile, Rachel and DC Kevin Lumb (Ben Batt) are both due to sit their sergeant's exam; however, she misses her exam following the news that Dominic has been hospitalised.

Rachel discovers that Nicholas Savage has been seriously assaulted in the car park of his city residence and, wildly drunk the night before at a party in the city centre, she cannot remember her whereabouts but has a painful bruise on her forehead. She is taken into questioning regarding the assault, but Savage dies in hospital from the injuries sustained and the assault case becomes a murder investigation. Rachel discovers Dominic had killed Nick, seeing Rachel's pain when Savage was not prosecuted.

2500|$|In Season 2, Liz {{declared}} {{that she and}} Jack [...] "are friends", {{and seems to be}} welcome in Jack's office at any time. The two joke often about their various personal and work-related problems, and increasingly offer each other advice. Jack has even surpassed Pete as Liz's most trusted confidant. This relationship culminated when Jack, after being told he was to be the next Chairman of General Electric, named Liz as his Vice President and successor. In essence, Liz and Jack have developed into each other's best sounding boards. For example, when Liz believed herself to be pregnant, her first reaction was to go to Jack's office (then occupied by the daughter of G.E.'s CEO) and, when ultimately she was unable to speak with him face to face, she left multiple messages on his phone. When Jack heavily embarrassed himself at a business retreat, Liz took the attention away from him by doing improvisation, including holding open her blouse to reveal her white bra. Jack was clearly moved and appreciative of her actions. She has done similar things multiple times, sacrificing her dignity for Jack's overall public appearance, as evidenced when she kissed Jack's business rival Devon Banks on security camera footage so she could extort him. Jack responded to this by saying [...] "Well played". Another example is in the episode [...] "I Do Do", when she stalled for him in front of a church, expanding her small reading to involve a guitar song and random readings from the Bible. Liz has a pregnancy scare in [...] "Cooter", and leaves a series of messages on Jack's voicemail as she goes through a series of emotions. The pregnancy test {{turns out to be a}} false reading, and Jack flies from Washington, D.C to New York, showing up <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>door</b> to comfort her. When Liz struggled with intimacy issues, Jack talked her through them and helped her get to the root of the problem. When she wanted to give up on herself and break up with Carol Burnett, Jack didn't allow her to, telling her [...] "You deserve a guy like Carol and he deserves you because, I'll only say this once a decade: you're great".|$|E
