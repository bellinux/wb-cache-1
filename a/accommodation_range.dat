40|$|Background: Regarding {{the high}} {{outbreak}} {{rate of the}} eye disorders and problems particularly accommodation disorders and convergence insufficiency in computer users, the study tries to determine the convergence, accommodation system, condition, fusion reserves and vision dimension in bank employees (who work with computers) and the control group (who are not computer users) and then to compare the mentioned parameters in the two groups. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional and observational study a total of 44 bank employees and 44 people as the control group members were selected randomly. Initially, refractive problems were reformed, and then accommodation, convergence and vision dimension evaluative tests were conducted. The test included measuring the near point of convergence, jump convergence, phoria, <b>accommodation</b> <b>range</b> (one eye, both eyes), ease of accommodation (one eye, both eyes), positive and negative related accommodation, near fusion versions and TNO. Results: Our results showed {{that there was a}} not significant difference among the near point of convergence, jump convergence, near phoria, <b>accommodation</b> <b>range</b> (one eye and both eyes), ease of accommodation (one eye, both eyes), positive and negative related accommodation in bank employees and control group. Conclusion: Regarding the studies, the outbreak rate of accommodation and convergence disorders is higher in bank employees than the control group which would be due to over working with computer within a fixed interval.

40|$|A {{group of}} digital human models with various sizes which {{properly}} represents a population under consideration {{is needed in}} the design process of an ergonomic product in virtual environment. The present study proposes a two-step method which produces a representative group of human models in terms of stature and weight. The proposed method first generates a designated number of pairs of stature and weight within an <b>accommodation</b> <b>range</b> from the bivariate normal distribution of stature and weight of the target population. Then, from each pair of stature and weight, the method determines the sizes of body segments by using ‘hierarchical ’ regression models and corresponding prediction distributions of individual values. The suggested method {{was applied to the}} 1988 US Army anthropometric survey data and implemented to a web-based system which generates a representative group of human models for the following parameters: nationality, gender, accommodation percentage, and number of human models...|$|E
40|$|Twelve {{subjects}} {{performed a}} complex task, detecting and recognizing small targets presented at infinity, while simultaneously monitoring a virtual image display (VID). The VID {{was presented at}} one of four optical distances (2. 0, 0. 5, 0. 0, and- 0. 5 D). Optical distance was found to affect detection and recognition performance, mainly at the extreme value of 2. 0 D. Interactions between optical distance and grouping of subjects according to measures of accommodation indicated that the three other optical distances affect performance differen-tially. The subjects ' resting position of accommodation (RPA) and a combined measure of <b>accommodation</b> <b>range</b> and RPA were significantly correlated with performance (0. 58). A narrowing of the functional visual field (complete misses of peripheral targets) was found at the 2. 0 -D optical distance for all subjects, and at the other optical distances for the subjects with an inferior accommodative mechanism (i. e., a near RPA and/or a narrowaccommoda-tion range) ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe dynamic {{accommodation}} {{responses to}} small, abrupt changes in an accommodation stimulus were studied in two experiments. In the first, responses of 19 subjects with ages distributed between 18 and 49 years were measured for step stimuli of ± 1. 05 D. In the second, responses to small step stimuli (± 0. 75, ± 1. 75 D) were recorded {{for a group}} of six ‘young’ (mean age 22, range 16 – 26 years) and six ‘old’ (mean age 42, range 36 – 48 years) subjects. In both experiments, the low target vergences always lay within the <b>accommodation</b> <b>range</b> of all subjects. Whether the data were analysed in terms of simple reaction and response times, or in terms of the frequency response, no marked systematic changes with age were found in the dynamics of the response in either of the experiments. It is concluded that, for small stimuli within the amplitude of accommodation, the response dynamics over the adult age range studied remain remarkably constant, even though the amplitude progressively reduces with age as complete presbyopia is approached...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} glasses-free 3 D display design with the {{potential}} to provide viewers with nearly correct accommodative depth cues, as well as motion parallax and binocular cues. Building on multilayer attenuator and directional backlight architectures, the proposed design achieves the high angular resolution needed for accommodation by placing spatial light modulators about a large lens: one conjugate to the viewer's eye, and one or more near the plane of the lens. Nonnegative tensor factorization is used to compress a high angular resolution light field into a set of masks that can be displayed on a pair of commodity LCD panels. By constraining the tensor factorization to preserve only those light rays seen by the viewer, we effectively steer narrow high-resolution viewing cones into the user's eyes, allowing binocular disparity, motion parallax, and the potential for nearly correct accommodation over a wide field of view. We verify the design experimentally by focusing a camera at different depths about a prototype display, establish formal upper bounds on the design's <b>accommodation</b> <b>range</b> and diffraction-limited performance, and discuss practical limitations that must be overcome to allow the device to be used with human observers...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{design and}} develop an {{accommodating}} intraocular lens (IOL) for endocapsular fixation with extended accommodative range {{that can be}} adapted to current standard extracapsular phacoemulsification technique. Methods: Ray tracing analysis and lens design; finite element modeling of biomechanical properties; cadaver eye implantation; initial clinical evaluation. Results: Ray tracing analysis indicated that a dual-optic design with a high plus-power front optic coupled to an optically compensatory minus posterior optic produced greater change in conjugation power of the eye compared to that produced by axial movement of a single-optic IOL, and that magnification effects were unlikely to account for improved near vision. Finite element modeling indicated that the two optics can be linked by spring-loaded haptics that allow anterior and posterior axial displacement of the front optic in response to changes in ciliary body tone and capsular tension. A dual-optic single-piece foldable silicone lens was constructed based on these principles. Subsequent initial clinical evaluation in 24 human eyes after phacoemulsification for cataract indicated mean 3. 22 diopters of <b>accommodation</b> (<b>range,</b> 1 to 5 D) based on defocus curve measurement. Accommodative amplitude evaluation at 1 - and 6 -month follow-up in all eyes indicated that the accommodative range was maintained and that the lens was well tolerated. Conclusions: A dual-optic design increases the accommodative effect of axial optic displacement, with minimal magnification effect. Initial clinical trials suggest that IOLs designed on this principle might provide true pseudophakic accommodation following cataract extraction and lens implantation.
