5|$|The {{historical}} {{minorities in}} Poland were most significantly affected, whereas Poland's multiethnic diversity reflected in prior national censuses {{was all but}} gone within several years after the war. The Polish educated class suffered greatly. <b>A</b> <b>large</b> <b>proportion</b> of the country's pre-war social and political elite perished and <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>proportion</b> were dispersed.|$|E

The main causes of loss include spoilage caused by moisture, moulds, micro-organisms, and vermin.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to works of art, <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>proportion</b> of the Museum's collection {{consists of the}} artefacts of the imperial court. This includes items used by the imperial family and the palace in daily life, as well as various ceremonial and bureaucratic items important to government administration. This comprehensive collection preserves the daily life and ceremonial protocols of the imperial era.|$|E
5|$|Later {{fires in}} 1706 and 1864 {{destroyed}} most medieval and Georgian architecture, and <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>proportion</b> of the town's listed buildings {{date from the}} Victorian period onwards.

5|$|According to {{regulations}} {{issued by}} the Royal Yugoslav Army in 1935, the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska was to be raised from the Slavonska military district, which was headquartered in Bjelovar. The Slavonska military district was {{under the command of}} the 4th Army district headquartered in Zagreb. It was named after the Slavonia region. In September 1939, after the German invasion of Poland, the division underwent a trial mobilisation which included <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>proportion</b> of its units. The divisional district included the regimental districts of the 42nd, 43rd and 108th Infantry Regiments.|$|E
5|$|After Georgia's {{outstanding}} 1896 performance, Warner {{returned to}} his alma mater Cornell at twice his Georgia salary. While remaining head coach at Iowa State, he coached Cornell to records of 5–3–1 in 1897 and 10–2 in 1898; in the latter season, Cornell outscored its opponents 296–29. Despite its 1898 success, tension existed within the team, as its assistant coach (backed by <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>proportion</b> of the players) lobbied to replace Warner. Acknowledging an issue with his leadership, Warner resigned.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the invasion, both {{mountain}} detachments had completed mobilisation and concentration, and were in position. Detachment Lika was at its mobilisation centre, but the turn-out of men for its infantry component was low. The 38th Infantry Division Dravska was completing its concentration. <b>A</b> <b>large</b> <b>proportion</b> of the 32nd Infantry Division Triglavski was moving from its mobilisation centres to its concentration areas. Across the 7th Army, around 80 percent of troops had answered the mobilisation order, but only 45 to 50 percent of vehicles and animals were available.|$|E

5|$|Cloud often forms inland, {{especially}} near hills. The {{average annual}} sunshine totals around 1,600hours. Rainfall {{tends to be}} associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds, and <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>proportion</b> of rain falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year. Average rainfall is around 35–60inch (900–1500mm). About 10–20days of snowfall is typical. From November to March, mean wind speeds are highest; winds are lightest from June to August. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.|$|E
5|$|Former {{mines in}} Italy, the United States and Mexico, which once {{produced}} <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>proportion</b> {{of the world}} supply, have now been completely mined out or, {{in the case of}} Slovenia (Idrija) and Spain (Almadén), shut down due to the fall of the price of mercury. Nevada's McDermitt Mine, the last mercury mine in the United States, closed in 1992. The price of mercury has been highly volatile over the years and in 2006 was $650 per 76-pound (34.46kg) flask.|$|E
5|$|In 1670, Charles II {{incorporated}} by royal charter the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), granting it {{a monopoly on}} the fur trade in the area known as Rupert's Land, which would later form <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>proportion</b> of the Dominion of Canada. Forts and trading posts established by the HBC were frequently the subject of attacks by the French, who had established their own fur trading colony in adjacent New France.|$|E

40|$|<b>A</b> <b>larger</b> <b>proportion</b> of {{the rural}} {{population}} than the urban population is uninsured and low income (living at or below 138 % of the federal poverty line [FPL]) (9. 9 % as compared to 8. 5 %) and <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>proportion</b> {{of the rural}} population than the urban population {{will be eligible for}} subsidized Health Insurance Marketplace (HIM) coverage due to income levels and current lack of insurance (10. 7 % as compared to 9. 6 %). Assuming full Medicaid expansion, <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>proportion</b> of the rural uninsured than the urban uninsured would be eligible for Medicaid (43. 5 % as compared to 38. 5 %). A smaller proportion of the rural uninsured than the urban uninsured has income above 400 % FPL and thus will not qualify for either Medicaid or HIM subsidies (10 % as compared to 14. 1 %). The proportion of the uninsured population potentially eligible for Medicaid expansion is highest in the rural South (47. 5 %) and lowest in the urban Northeast (32. 5 %) and the rural Northeast (35. 8 %) ...|$|R
5|$|In writing {{polyphonic}} {{settings of}} psalms, Josquin was a pioneer, and psalm settings form <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>proportion</b> of the motets of his later years. Few composers prior to Josquin had written polyphonic psalm settings. Some of Josquin's settings include the famous Miserere, written in Ferrara in 1503 or 1504 {{and most likely}} inspired by the recent execution of the reformist monk Girolamo Savonarola, Memor esto verbi tui, based on Psalm 119, and two settings of De profundis (Psalm 130), {{both of which are}} often considered to be among his most significant accomplishments.|$|E
5|$|Low-dose aspirin use irreversibly {{blocks the}} {{formation}} of thromboxane A2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet (8–9 days). This antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks in {{people who have had}} a heart attack, unstable angina, ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. 40mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>proportion</b> of maximum thromboxane A2 release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.|$|E
5|$|Teleosts are {{economically}} {{important in}} different ways. They are captured for food around the world. A {{small number of}} species such as herring, cod, pollock, anchovy, tuna and mackerel provide people with {{millions of tons of}} food per year, while many other species are fished in smaller amounts. They provide <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>proportion</b> of the fish caught for sport. Commercial and recreational fishing together provide millions of people with employment.|$|E
30|$|In Germany, {{belonging}} to the nation still rests primarily on ancestry, but second-generation Turks’ experiences with exclusion in white spaces {{are similar to those}} in France. Ethnicity and religious background matter more than class, particularly for those respondents who moved to middle-class neighborhoods in more peripheral parts of Berlin with <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>proportion</b> of whites. In contrast to Paris, where the neighborhood functions as a proxy for visible difference, there is no exclusion based on one’s address in Berlin. It is only the visible otherness that matters. The consequence of these experiences of exclusion is a withdrawal to the inner-city neighborhoods with <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>proportion</b> of ethnic minorities.|$|R
30|$|SSc {{patients}} with high eosinophil levels had higher m-Rodnan TSS values (11.1 vs. 5.7, p =  0.029) and proportions of {{patients with}} skin pruritus (57 vs. 13  %, p =  0.014), and this group included <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>proportion</b> {{of patients with}} moderate or severe ILD (57 vs. 13  %, p =  0.014) than those within normal limits. <b>A</b> <b>larger</b> <b>proportion</b> of patients with the diffuse phenotype manifested high eosinophil counts than those within the normal range, but not to a statistically significant extent (43 vs. 17  %, p =  0.137). Age at onset of SSc symptoms, at diagnosis or at evaluation of eosinophil counts was not different between the two groups.|$|R
50|$|As Campbell (1984) shows, {{the nursing}} {{profession}} was transformed by World War Two. Army and Navy nursing was highly attractive and <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>proportion</b> of nurses volunteered for service higher {{than any other}} occupation in American society.|$|R
