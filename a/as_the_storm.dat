5|$|As Tropical Storm Emily quickly {{approached}} the Windward Islands on September21, {{a tropical storm}} warning was issued for Grenada, Barbados, St. Vincent and St. Lucia. A tropical storm watch was also declared for Martinique. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> tracked through the islands, all watches and warnings were discontinued later that day. Early on September22, a hurricane warning was issued for the southern coast of the Dominican Republic and southern Haiti, including the southwestern peninsula. Upon attaining major hurricane status, a hurricane warning was declared for northern Haiti <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> was anticipated to maintain hurricane intensity through landfall. Later that day, a hurricane watch was issued for the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. This watch was later upgraded to a warning <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> was expected to regain intensity over the Bahamas.|$|E

5|$|In Fakaofo, {{the storm}} surge from Percy damaged a sea wall and caused major beach erosion. One house was {{destroyed}} while others were severely damaged.

Atafu also suffered similar damage <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> damaged a UHF tower and several storage sheds.

5|$|Jimena {{continued}} to intensify {{as it moved}} westward. On August 29, satellite imagery showed a well defined eye developing in the storm <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> winds increased to 60mph (97km/h). Jimena then was upgraded to hurricane status later that day. At 1500 UTC, visible satellite imagery showed the storm having a small cloud filled eye and developing banding features south of the storm's center as Jimena {{continued to}} move west northwest. As the hurricane neared the Central Pacific Basin, it winds reached a peak intensity of 105mph (165km/h) and the barometric pressure fell to 970millibars on August 30. At 0600 UTC, the National Hurricane Center issued its last advisory on Jimena <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> crossed into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility.|$|E
5|$|Located to the {{southeast}} of a broad and deep tropospheric trough and {{to the west of}} a low to mid-level ridge, Omar took a counter-clockwise turn on October14. Upon becoming a tropical storm, Omar began to undergo an extended period of rapid intensification as very deep convection developed around the center of circulation. Wind shear around the storm, which was previously inhibiting quick development, weakened, allowing for further strengthening. Later that day, an 11.5 to 17.2mi (18.5 to 27.7km) wide eye formed <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> began to turn towards the northeast due to the trough. With the formation of an eye, the Dvorak technique rendered an intensity of 75mph (120km/h), signifying that Omar had intensified into a hurricane. The intensification briefly stalled as the eyewall eroded and the center of the storm became slightly elliptical. However, deep convection persisted and strengthening was forecast <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> neared Puerto Rico. Shortly after, the eye quickly became well-defined and appeared on visible satellite images, an indication the storm was intensifying. The chances of rapid intensification were good <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> featured well-developed outflow and prominent banding features.|$|E

5|$|After Iris {{strengthened}} into a hurricane, {{it turned}} to the west-southwest due to interaction with Hurricane Humberto. An upper-level low north of Puerto Rico increased wind shear over the hurricane, which dislocated the center from the deep convection. As a result, Iris weakened to tropical storm status on August24 after being a hurricane for about 24hours. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> approached the Lesser Antilles, the thunderstorms decreased markedly and the cloud pattern became disorganized. As late as August25, there was uncertainty whether Iris would continue toward the islands or turn to the north. A new circulation became the dominant center <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> continued westward, and Iris brushed Saint Lucia early on August26. An approaching trough turned the storm to the northwest, bringing it near most of the Lesser Antilles. Early on August27, Iris weakened to an intensity of , although it immediately began restrengthening. Later that day, the center made landfall on Montserrat, Anguilla, and Barbuda with winds of over 60mph (95km/h). By that time, an eye began reforming, and the structure became better organized as wind shear decreased.|$|E

5|$|After Narelle {{moved into}} TCWC Perth's area of {{responsibility}} on 9 January, a cyclone watch was issued for areas between Whim Creek and Coral Bay. A blue alert, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) lowest level of readiness, was also issued for areas between Mardie and Whim Creek. The following day, the watch was upgraded to a cyclone warning for all areas and a new watch was issued to the west, encompassing areas as far as Cape Cuvier. The watch was further extended early on 11 January to include areas between Cape Cuvier and Carnarvon. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> continued on a more westward path than initially anticipated, the warning area was gradually decreased, with areas east of Roebourne receiving the all clear later on 11 January. The watch area, however, continued to expand and encompassed areas as far east as Denham. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> made its closet approach to Western Australia on 13 January, the watches and warnings area were gradually discontinued, with all advisories being discontinued that afternoon.|$|E
