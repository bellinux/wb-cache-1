5000|$|Once {{service of}} process has been effected, the {{responsible}} officer or process server must typically file a return of service or proof of service or [...] "Affidavit of Service" [...] with the court (or convey one to the plaintiff to file with the court). The return of service indicates {{the time and place}} at which service was effected, the person served, and any additional information needed to establish that service was properly made. It is signed by the process server, and operates as prima facie evidence that {{service of process}} was effectively made. Arizona Court Rules also require that any return or <b>affidavit</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> filed by a process server other than a sheriff or constable shall clearly state the county in which the process server is registered. Many Arizona process servers include their Certification Number on their returns/affidavits. Certification Numbers are assigned by the Clerk of the Superior Court in each county.|$|E
5000|$|Typically, the {{plaintiff}} (or cross-complainant, cross-plaintiff, counter-claimant, counter-plaintiff, third-party plaintiff, etc.) must show that {{service of process}} was effected on the defendant (cross-defendant, counter-defendant, cross-defendant, third-party defendant, etc.). This is typically achieved by the filing of an <b>affidavit</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> (also known as a proof of service), which gives enough information to allow the court to confirm that valid service has been accomplished. [...] Typically the affidavit states, under oath or penalty of perjury, that service was effected on a named defendant, briefly describes how it was effected, names the person who made service, and gives the place and date service was effected. [...] Once the requisite time {{to respond to the}} complaint has passed, the defendant is [...] "in default"; this may be automatic, or it may require the court clerk to enter the default (which may, in turn, require that {{the plaintiff}} request entry of the default). [...] Some defaults do not take effect until a set period of time after the clerk acts. [...] The clerk may have to give the defendant notice of his default, affording a chance to have the default vacated.|$|E
40|$|In Hill v Robertson Suspension Systems Pty Ltd [2009] QDC 165 McGill DCJ {{considered}} the procedural {{requirements for the}} service of originating process on a company, and for proving that service {{for the purpose of}} obtaining default judgment. The judge’s views adopt a strict and technical construction of the requirements for an <b>affidavit</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> under r 120 (1) (b). Though clearly obiter, they may well affect the approach taken on applications to enter or set aside default judgments in the lower courts. Pending further judicial consideration of the issue, it is suggested the prudent course is to ensure that the deponent of an affidavit for service effected under s 109 X(1) (a) of the Act deposes not only to the location of the registered office of the company but also, at a minimum, provides the source of that information...|$|E
