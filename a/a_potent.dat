5|$|French Creole {{music is}} most famously {{associated}} with Martinique and Guadeloupe, though {{the islands of}} Saint Lucia and Dominica are also home to French Antillean music. Creole music {{is characterized by the}} prominence of the quadrille dance, distinct from the French version and related to the Haitian mereng. The quadrille is <b>a</b> <b>potent</b> symbol of French Antillean culture.|$|E

5|$|The {{operation}} {{became the}} most intense air/ground battle waged during the Cold War period; {{it was the most}} difficult such campaign fought by the United States since the aerial bombardment of Germany during World War II. Supported by communist allies, North Vietnam fielded <b>a</b> <b>potent</b> mixture of sophisticated air-to-air and surface-to-air weapons that created {{one of the most effective}} air defenses ever faced by American military aviators.|$|E
5|$|After {{these initial}} {{observations}} in plants, laboratories searched for this phenomenon in other organisms. Craig C. Mello and Andrew Fire's 1998 Nature paper reported <b>a</b> <b>potent</b> gene silencing effect after injecting double stranded RNA into C. elegans. In investigating {{the regulation of}} muscle protein production, they observed that neither mRNA nor antisense RNA injections {{had an effect on}} protein production, but double-stranded RNA successfully silenced the targeted gene. As a result of this work, they coined the term RNAi. This discovery represented the first identification of the causative agent for the phenomenon. Fire and Mello were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.|$|E
50|$|Cyproheptadine is <b>a</b> very <b>potent</b> {{antihistamine}} or antagonist of the H1 receptor. At higher concentrations, it {{also has}} anticholinergic, antiserotonergic, and antidopaminergic activities. Of the serotonin receptors, it is <b>an</b> especially <b>potent</b> antagonist of the 5-HT2 receptors, and this underlies its effectiveness {{in the treatment of}} serotonin syndrome.|$|R

5|$|Alprazolam, {{available}} {{under the}} trade name Xanax, is <b>a</b> <b>potent,</b> short-acting benzodiazepine anxiolytic—a minor tranquilizer. It {{is commonly used}} {{for the treatment of}} anxiety disorders, especially of panic disorder, but also in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or social anxiety disorder. It was the 12th most prescribed medicine in the United States in 2010. Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, binds to specific sites on the GABAA receptor. It possesses anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, skeletal muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, amnestic, and antidepressant properties. Alprazolam is available for oral administration as compressed tablets (CT) and extended-release capsules (XR).|$|E
5|$|Although many natural toxins are {{secondary}} metabolites, these poisons {{also include}} peptides and proteins. An {{example of a}} toxic peptide is alpha-amanitin, which is found in relatives of the death cap mushroom. This is <b>a</b> <b>potent</b> enzyme inhibitor, in this case preventing the RNA polymerase II enzyme from transcribing DNA. The algal toxin microcystin is also a peptide and is an inhibitor of protein phosphatases. This toxin can contaminate water supplies after algal blooms and is a known carcinogen that can also cause acute liver hemorrhage and death at higher doses.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} a {{medicinal}} enzyme inhibitor is sildenafil (Viagra), a common treatment for male erectile dysfunction. This compound is <b>a</b> <b>potent</b> inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5, the enzyme that degrades the signalling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate. This signalling molecule triggers smooth muscle relaxation and allows blood flow into the corpus cavernosum, which causes an erection. Since the drug decreases {{the activity of the}} enzyme that halts the signal, it makes this signal last {{for a longer period of}} time.|$|E

Hops, and beer made with it, contain 8-prenylnaringenin which is <b>a</b> <b>potent</b> phytoestrogen. Hop also contains myrcene, humulene, xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol, myrcenol, linalool, tannins and resin. The alcohol 2M2B is a component of hops brewing.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{was viewed}} as <b>a</b> <b>potent</b> source of {{nourishment}} for the Maya deities, and the sacrifice of a living creature was a powerful blood offering. By extension, the sacrifice of a human life was the ultimate offering of blood to the gods, {{and the most important}} Maya rituals culminated in human sacrifice. Generally only high status prisoners of war were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.|$|E
5|$|Boise State {{faced the}} nation's top {{all-purpose}} yards leader, All-American Chris Johnson. Johnson racked up {{an average of}} 212.67all-purpose yards per game during the 2007 season, making him <b>a</b> <b>potent</b> threat on offense. Taking snaps for the offense were quarterbacks Patrick Pinkney and Rob Kass. Pinkney had a passer rating of 131.58, while Kass had a comparable rating of 122.94. The top receiver for the Pirates was Jamar Bryant, who averaged 3.5 catches for 52.17yards per game. In addition to Chris Johnson, who {{was named to the}} C–USA All–Conference second team, offensive lineman Josh Coffman received C–USA All-Conference second team honors.|$|E

5|$|Diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) {{is shown}} {{as an example}} of an {{irreversible}} protease inhibitor in the figure above right. The enzyme hydrolyses the phosphorus–fluorine bond, but the phosphate residue remains bound to the serine in the active site, deactivating it. Similarly, DFP also reacts with the active site of acetylcholine esterase in the synapses of neurons, and consequently is <b>a</b> <b>potent</b> neurotoxin, with a lethal dose of less than 100mg.|$|E
5|$|Ibotenic {{acid and}} {{muscimol}} are structurally {{related to each}} other and to two major neurotransmitters of the central nervous system: glutamic acid and GABA respectively. Ibotenic acid and muscimol act like these neurotransmitters, muscimol being <b>a</b> <b>potent</b> GABAA agonist, while ibotenic acid is an agonist of NMDA glutamate receptors and certain metabotropic glutamate receptors which are involved in the control of neuronal activity. It is these interactions which are thought to cause the psychoactive effects found in intoxication. Muscimol is the agent responsible for the majority of the psychoactivity.|$|E
5|$|The Commonwealth's {{struggles with}} the Cossacks were being paid {{attention}} to at Moscow's Kremlin, which from the late 1620s began regarding Cossacks as <b>a</b> <b>potent</b> source of fundamental instability in the Polish–Lithuanian rival and neighbor. Russian efforts to destabilize the Polish Kingdom using Cossacks in the 1630s were not yet successful, even though the Cossack elders themselves often {{raised the possibility of}} a union with the Tsardom to pressure Poland's ruling elites. The borderlands with Russia had become a place of refuge for Cossacks persecuted after their failed uprisings; regiments of Russian-registered Cossacks, following the Commonwealth example, were eventually established there.|$|E

5|$|The RaLa Experiment, or RaLa, was {{a series}} of tests during and after the Manhattan Project {{designed}} to study the behavior of converging shock waves to achieve the spherical implosion necessary for compression of the plutonium pit of the nuclear weapon. The experiment used significant amounts of a short-lived radioisotope lanthanum-140, <b>a</b> <b>potent</b> source of gamma radiation; the RaLa is a contraction of Radioactive Lanthanum. The method was proposed by Robert Serber and developed by a team led by the Italian experimental physicist Bruno Rossi.|$|E
5|$|At {{four days}} to Zero Hour, the alien plant has grown to cover {{many areas of the}} base. After SG-1 go missing on their off-world mission, a Goa'uld named Ba'al {{contacts}} Stargate Command and suggests an exchange of the captured SG-1 against Camulus, another Goa'uld who requested asylum on Earth several episodes before. With the help of Camulus, <b>a</b> <b>potent</b> power source is found and brought back to Stargate Command, only to find it tainted by Camulus (powering it up could result in the destruction of the Solar system). With the SGC suffering from a temporary electricity failure caused by the alien plants, Ba'al's renewed contacting only results in O'Neill's mocking. Exhausted by sleep deprivation two days to Zero Hour, O'Neill finishes his letter to General Hammond to inform him of his resignation.|$|E
5|$|Boise State {{came into}} the game {{averaging}} 42.75points and 475.67yards per game, the fourth and twelfth highest totals in college football. Senior quarterback Taylor Tharp led the offense by more than 3,000yards and 28 touchdowns, headed into the 2007 Hawaii Bowl. On the ground, the Broncos were led by junior running back Ian Johnson, who had 17touchdowns and 1,030yards in the regular season. Wide receiver Jeremy Childs also was <b>a</b> <b>potent</b> threat on offense, averaging 87.08receiving yards per game, and backup running back D.J. Harper rushed for 41.44yards per game on average. Johnson and Childs both earned First Team All-WAC honors, and Tharp was named to Second Team All-WAC.
