50|$|A Vickers-Armstrongs shadow factory {{assembling}} Wellingtons, {{was situated}} at Byley but {{close to the}} airfield. The completed aircraft would be towed from the factory to the airfield for their first flight and onward delivery. In July 1942 1531 Flight was formed as a Beam Approach Training Flight using the Airspeed Oxford.

50|$|The private {{airfield}} Wangen-Lachen {{is located}} inmidst the protected area Nuoler Ried {{on the southern}} shore of the lake. The adjacent nature reserve Wägitaler Aa is a breeding ground paradise for various rare species of birds. In 1949 a private pilot, a flight instructor and the aviation pioneer Alfred Comte entered into a lease agreement with the Genossame (cooperative) Wangen. On 29 June 1950 {{for the first time}} a plane landed on the grass runway of the airfield. Since 1957 also seaplanes use the lake shore area, being today - the Ad Astra Aero airport at Zürichhorn was closed around 1931 - the last water airfield in Switzerland.

5000|$|The {{fault in}} the ADF system made it {{impossible}} to be used as an <b>approach</b> <b>aid.</b> The VOR flag alarm was set too high and the glide-slope deflection sensitivity indication was set 50% more than its usual operational setting. It didn't prevent the system, but was rather [...] "exacting for the pilots". The faulty settings of the glide-slope alarm circuit prevented the flag appearing until the two signals were unusable or not received. If the faulty unit received an [...] "unsatisfactory signal", the pointer could move to the mid-position. The pilot on the left seat could not notice this failure. This is dangerous. If the pointer moved to the mid-position, the crew would have thought that they were on the correct glide path. Investigators then questioned the airworthiness of the aircraft due to these faults.|$|E
50|$|On 18 June 2013, a Virgin Australia Boeing 737-800 {{operating}} {{a flight from}} Brisbane to Adelaide with 91 passengers and crew on board diverted to Mildura due to heavy fog which had closed Adelaide airport. The flight carried enough fuel to allow roughly 30 minutes holding. A Qantas 737 had also diverted to Mildura, arriving after the Virgin flight and radioed that they were running low on fuel. This was interpreted by the Virgin crew as an urgent situation and they allowed the Qantas flight to land ahead. With the airport's automated weather service unavailable and the visibility deteriorating, the Virgin flight conducted a missed approach and now critically low on fuel were forced to commit to an immediate emergency landing. Mildura airport is not equipped with an Instrument Landing System <b>approach</b> <b>aid</b> and the crew performed the landing without visual reference to the runway on the second attempt. The aircraft landed with 535 kg remaining fuel.|$|E

5000|$|Noted Zambian {{economist}} Dambisa Moyo {{has been}} a fierce opponent to development aid, and calls it “the single worst decision of modern developmental politics”. Her book, Dead Aid describes how aid has encouraged kleptocracies, corruption, aid-dependency {{and a series of}} detrimental economic effects and vicious downward spirals of development in Africa. She argues that foreign aid provides a windfall to governments which can encourage extreme forms of rent-seeking and through providing a positive shock of revenue, lead to Dutch Disease. Furthermore, this easy money offers governments an exit from the contract between them and their electorate: the contract that states that they must provide public goods in exchange for taxes. In short, it [...] "allows the state to abdicate its responsibilities toward its people". It {{is important to note that}} Moyo alludes specifically to government bilateral and multilateral aid and not small-holder charity, humanitarian or emergency aid.Her prescriptions call for increased trade and foreign direct investment, emphasizing China’s burgeoning role in Africa. [...] Moyo also makes a case for micro-financing schemes, as popularized by the widespread success of Grameen Bank, to spark entrepreneurship within the continent on the ground level, thus building from the bottom-up as opposed to the top-down <b>approach</b> <b>aid</b> takes.|$|E
5000|$|At that time, Autoland {{had lower}} {{priority}} because efforts were concentrated on other projects including rapid landing of aircraft for RAF Fighter Command, visual aids for pilots, runway approach lighting and an <b>approach</b> <b>aid</b> using DME with Barbro. That changed when Operational Requirement 947 (OR947) for automatic {{landing on the}} V-Force bomber fleet was issued in 1954. [...] At that time the V-bomber force was the UK's main contribution to the strategic nuclear power of the west [...] and all-weather operation was essential. There was also renewed interest in automatic landing for civil aviation. As {{the next step in}} the development, the flare-out and coupling units from the Devon were linked to a Smiths Type D autopilot and installed in Varsity WF417, a much larger aircraft, capable of carrying 38 people rather than 10 in the Devon. The first fully automatic approach and landing was made by WF417 on 11 November 1954 under calm and misty conditions. [...] A similar system was installed in Canberra WE189 to provide the first application of Autoland to jet-type aircraft. [...] Automatic approaches [...] and automatic landings [...] were recorded by WE189 but the development was interrupted in April 1956 when the facilities at Woodbridge, which had the only suitable leader cable installation, ceased to be available to BLEU. Development of auto-flare and automatic kicking-off drift was continued at RAF Wittering, but in September that year WE189, returning from tests at Wittering, crashed due to engine failure on an approach when returning to its base at Martlesham Heath. The pilot, Flt. Lt. Les Coe, and the BLEU scientist in charge of the project, Mr. Joe Birkle, were killed.|$|E

40|$|The {{journey of}} any {{doctorate}} is a challenging one. It constitutes a learning curve for postgraduate students towards becoming effective and fully independent academics. Through {{a concern for}} effective mentoring, {{the challenges of the}} doctoral effort have been well-documented. The particular issues a Ph.

Achieving a doctorate through a mixed methods study can be a very fruitful endeavour indeed. Excellent core handbooks, example studies and ongoing formalisation of the <b>approach</b> <b>aid</b> in delivering successful work. Yet the chosen methodological path may also bring up some specific hurdles. This paper aims to discuss some of those potential barriers as learning opportunities, and offer an initial discussion of the support systems. Specifically highlighted as potential challenges are the current ‘trendy’ nature of mixed methods research, the search for optimal design, the development of skills, domain loyalties and paradigm problems, specific difficulties in publishing, isolation threat and justification needs. For Ph. D. students, an understanding of these challenges is a first step towards overcoming them, and achieving conscious competence...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Book {{recommendation}} {{systems can}} benefit commercial websites, social mediasites, anddigital libraries, tonameafew, byalleviating the knowledge acquisition process of users who look for {{books that are}} appealing to them. Even though existing book recommenders, {{which are based on}} either collaborative filtering, text content, or the hybrid <b>approach,</b> <b>aid</b> users in locating books (among the millions available), their recommendations are not personalized enough to meet users ’ expectations due totheir collective assumption on group preference and/or exact content matching, which is a failure. To address this problem, we have developed PBRecS, a book recommendation system that is based on social interactions and personal interests to suggest books appealing to users. PBRecS relies on the friendships established on a social networking site, such as LibraryThing, to generate more personalized suggestions by including in the recommendations solely books that belong to a user’s friends who share common interests with the user, in addition to applying word-correlation factors for partially matching book tags to disclose books similar in contents. The conducted empirical study on data extracted from LibraryThing has verified (i) the effectiveness of PBRecS using social-media data {{to improve the quality of}} book recommendations and (ii) that PBRecS outperforms the recommenders employed by Amazon and LibraryThing. ...|$|E
40|$|Recent work {{such as that}} of the Joint Health Systems Research Project {{has done}} a great deal to support and {{encourage}} health systems research. Despite that, health service managers in developing countries only rarely regard research as integral to the process of priority setting, planning and management. To some extent, this is because the organisational environment is not supportive of managerial initiatives for research-based change. Furthermore, health-related research tends to support a relatively narrow range of managerial activity. The research process itself militates against those qualitative research methods which would frequently provide the appropriate tools for the study of management problems. Six possible reasons for this are proposed. The first is the expectation of those controlling funding and research, that it should produce generalisations. Second, there is a gap between the biomedical research which tends to get funded, and the problems managers really need to solve. Third, disproportionate attention is given to the evaluation of health status over and above organisational states. Fourth, much health systems research tends to embody a simplistic assumption that the only social function of health services is to improve health. Fifth, much of the research which is done is evaluative, and evaluations are frequently required to tell us whether formal goals have been achieved; this both rules out a learning process approach, and militates against finding out what is actually happening. Sixth, the question is raised that funding agencies may {{play a major role in}} limiting the use of qualitative research methods. It is suggested that any such effect may be peculiar to the health sector. As a way ahead, conscious efforts to increase the extent to which the research environment helps managers to develop a problem-solving approach, are needed. qualitative research health service managers learning process <b>approach</b> <b>aid</b> agencies health systems...|$|E
