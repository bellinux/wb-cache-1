5|$|International flights that {{bypassed}} traditional hub <b>airports</b> <b>and</b> {{landed at}} smaller cities became more common throughout the 1980s, and this eroded the 747's original market.

5|$|Not all {{interactions}} {{between humans and}} cattle egrets are beneficial. The cattle egret can be a safety hazard to aircraft due to its habit of feeding in large groups in the grassy verges of <b>airports,</b> <b>and</b> it has been implicated in the spread of animal infections such as heartwater, infectious bursal disease and possibly Newcastle disease.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Aviation Administration {{proposed}} in 1994 closing the airport along with eight other regional airports, {{because they had}} high subsidy levels.

Train service was canceled on Kyushu during the storm.|$|E
5|$|Buildings, {{operations}} and management {{have become increasingly}} sophisticated since the mid 20th century, when international airports began to provide infrastructure for international civilian flights. Detailed technical standards {{have been developed to}} ensure safety and common coding systems implemented to provide global consistency. The physical structures that serve millions of individual passengers and flights are among the most complex and interconnected in the world. By the second decade of the 21st century, there were over 1,200 international <b>airports</b> <b>and</b> almost two billion international passengers along with 50 million metric tonnes of cargo were passing through them annually.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the airport}} started in 1943 by the Luftwaffe who {{stationed}} a detachment of Jagdgeschwader 5 (JS5) there. Civilian operations started 1970 and were first provided by Norving. The airport was upgraded {{as part of a}} national program to establish regional <b>airports</b> <b>and</b> from 1974 services were taken over by Widerøe using de Havilland Canada Twin Otter aircraft. The current terminal building dates from 1988; Dash 8 aircraft were introduced in 1994. There have been local proposals to expand the airport, but Avinor does not wish to pursue these.|$|E
5|$|Home to {{approximately}} 7.68 million people, the nine-county Bay Area contains many cities, towns, <b>airports,</b> <b>and</b> associated regional, state, and national parks, {{connected by a}} complex multimodal transportation network.

The Bay Area's population is ethnically diverse: for example, roughly half of the region's residents are Hispanic, Asian, African American, or Pacific Islander, all of whom have a significant presence throughout the region.|$|E

5|$|Manchester Airport {{serves as}} the main {{international}} hub for Northern England and is the busiest airport anywhere in the UK outside London, handling 25.6 million people in 2016. In total, there are seven international airports in the North; these are (in descending order of passenger traffic) Manchester, Newcastle, Liverpool John Lennon, Leeds Bradford, Doncaster Sheffield, Humberside and Durham Tees Valley. Many of these airports were developed during the boom in low-cost air travel during the early 2000s, but have suffered since the Great Recession – Durham Tees Valley is running at just 3% of its maximum capacity, and Blackpool Airport closed as an international airport in 2014. The devolution of Air Passenger Duty to Scotland represents a further possible threat to Northern English airports, allowing Scottish airports to offer cheaper flights than their English rivals. Few spoke flights operate between Northern <b>airports</b> <b>and</b> the national hubs at Heathrow and Gatwick, putting further strain on the smaller Northern <b>airports</b> <b>and</b> forcing connecting passengers to travel via continental European airports. The planned High Speed 2 station at Manchester Airport will offer direct high-speed services to London, allowing spare capacity at Manchester Airport {{to take some of}} the flights which currently serve busy London airports.|$|E
5|$|Manchester's civic {{leadership}} {{has a reputation}} for business acumen. It owns two of the country's four busiest <b>airports</b> <b>and</b> uses its earnings to fund local projects. Meanwhile, KPMG's competitive alternative report found that in 2012 Manchester had the 9th lowest tax cost of any industrialised city in the world, and fiscal devolution has come earlier to Manchester than to any other British city: it can keep half the extra taxes it gets from transport investment.|$|E

5|$|A committee, led by Erik Himle {{and later}} Preben Munthe, was {{appointed}} in 1962 to consider additional airports in Norway. The Sud Aviation Caravelle {{was about to}} the phased into use on the main domestic routes and the committee recommended in 1964 that nine new airports be built which could serve jetliners, including one airport in Florø. Widerøe came with an alternative proposal and suggested that a network of smaller airports be built instead, which could be served using short take-off and landing aircraft, which were being developed at the time. Smaller airports could be built and operated at lower cost than larger airports, but both <b>airports</b> <b>and</b> airlines would need subsidies to operate. Håkon Kyllingmark was appointed Minister of Transport and Communications in 1965 and was a proponent of the STOLport proposal. The political rationale was that, despite that the total operating costs would rise, it would provide better services to rural areas and thus keep up their population.|$|E
