5|$|Patterns in Rule 184 {{typically}} quickly stabilize, {{either to}} <b>a</b> <b>pattern</b> {{in which the}} cell states move in lockstep one position leftwards at each step, or to <b>a</b> <b>pattern</b> that moves one position rightwards at each step. Specifically, if the initial density of cells with state 1 is less than 50%, the pattern stabilizes into clusters of cells in state 1, spaced two units apart, with the clusters separated by blocks of cells in state 0. Patterns of this type move rightwards. If, on the other hand, the initial density is greater than 50%, the pattern stabilizes into clusters of cells in state 0, spaced two units apart, with the clusters separated by blocks of cells in state 1, and patterns of this type move leftwards. If the density is exactly 50%, the initial pattern stabilizes (more slowly) to <b>a</b> <b>pattern</b> that can equivalently be viewed as moving either leftwards or rightwards at each step: an alternating sequence of 0s and 1s.|$|E

5|$|The coat of {{the breed}} {{come in a}} variety of shades with the colours being {{separated}} into three main groups: black/black and tan, any solid colour other than black (ASCOB), and parti-colour. The black variety is either all black, or with tan points on the dog's head, the feet and the tail in <b>a</b> <b>pattern</b> called black and tan. The group known as ASCOB includes all other solid colours from light cream through to dark red, although some lighter colouring is allowed on the feathering according to standards. Parti-coloured dogs are white with patches of another colour such as black or brown, and includes any roan coloured dogs. In addition, American Cockers coats can come in <b>a</b> <b>pattern</b> known as merle, which is not recognised by the American Kennel Club.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Hebbian hetero-associative {{learning}} is inherently asymmetric. Storing a forward association from <b>pattern</b> <b>A</b> to <b>pattern</b> B enables the recalling of pattern B given <b>pattern</b> <b>A.</b> This, in general, {{does not allow}} the recalling of <b>pattern</b> <b>A</b> given <b>pattern</b> B. The forward association between A and B will tend to be stronger than the backward association between B and A. In this paper it is described how the dynamical associative model proposed in [10] can be extended to create a bi-directional associative memory where forward association between A and B is equal to backward association between B and A. This implies that storing a forward association, from <b>pattern</b> <b>A</b> to <b>pattern</b> B, would enable the recalling of pattern B given <b>pattern</b> <b>A</b> and the recalling of <b>pattern</b> <b>A</b> given <b>pattern</b> B. We give some formal results that support {{the functioning of the}} proposal, and provide some examples were the proposal finds application. ...|$|R

5|$|When {{cephalopod}} molluscs like squid and cuttlefish {{find themselves}} against a light background, they contract {{many of their}} chromatophores, concentrating the pigment into a smaller area, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>pattern</b> of tiny, dense, but widely spaced dots, appearing light. When they enter a darker environment, they allow their chromatophores to expand, creating <b>a</b> <b>pattern</b> of larger dark spots, and making their bodies appear dark. Amphibians such as frogs have three kinds of star-shaped chromatophore cells in separate layers of their skin. The top layer contains 'xanthophores' with orange, red, or yellow pigments; the middle layer contains 'iridophores' with a silvery light-reflecting pigment; while the bottom layer contains 'melanophores' with dark melanin.|$|E

Water from the lake {{may have contributed to}} increased oxygen-18 at Sajama around 14,300 years ago, possibly triggered by evaporation. As the lake level dropped, Lake Poopó would have been disconnected first; the sill separating it from the rest of Lake Tauca is relatively shallow. Coipasa and Uyuni would have remained connected until later. Water levels in Lake Titicaca's Lake Huinaimarca were low by 14,200 BP.|$|E

Meikle viewed this as a deterioration of Stevenson's original narrative initiated by Sullivan. Later adaptations diverged from the model established by Sullivan and the early films; some returned to Stevenson's novella, and others spun new variations from aspects of earlier versions.|$|E
