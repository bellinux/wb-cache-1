5|$|The {{stranding}} of the Northern bottlenose whale mainly {{happens in}} two {{villages in the}} northern part of Suðuroy: Hvalba and Sandvík. It is believed that it happens because of a navigation problem of the whale, because there are isthmuses on these places, where the distance between the east and west coasts are short, around one kilometer or so. <b>And</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> it seems like the bottlenose whale want to take a short cut through what it thinks is a sound, and too late it discovers, that is on shallow ground and is unable to turn around again. It happened on 30 August 2012, when two Northern bottlenose whales swam ashore to the gorge Sigmundsgjógv in Sandvík. Two men who were working on the harbour noticed these whales, and some time later they had either died by themselves or were killed by the locals and then cut up for food for the people of Sandvík and Hvalba (Hvalba municipality).|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, as I tell {{my white}} friends, we as black people, we're {{never going to}} be {{successful}}, not because of you white people, but because of other black people. When you're black, {{you have to deal with}} so much crap in your life from other black people. It's a dirty, dark secret; I'm glad it's coming out. One of the reasons we're {{never going to be}} successful as a whole, because of other black people. <b>And</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> we are brainwashed to think, if you're not a thug or an idiot, you're not black enough. If you go to school, make good grades, speak intelligent, and don't break the law, you're not a good black person. And it's a dirty, dark secret. There are a lot of black people who are unintelligent, who don't have success. It's best to knock a successful black person down because they're intelligent, they speak well, they do well in school, and they're successful... We're the only ethnic group who say, 'Hey, if you go to jail, it gives you street cred.' It's just typical BS that goes on when you're black, man.|$|E

The bulldozer kept moving, and she slipped and fell off the plow. But the bulldozer kept moving, the shovel above her. I guess it was about 10 or 15 meters that it dragged her <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> didn't stop. We shouted like crazy to the operator through loudspeakers that he should stop, but he just kept going and didn't lift the shovel. Then it stopped and backed up. We ran to Rachel. She was still breathing.|$|E

25|$|The Goa'uld ruled Earth for {{thousands}} of years, in the personae of gods from Earth's classical religions. It is never clarified, however, whether the Goa'uld impersonate deities that already existed in human mythology or if they themselves were the origin of those deities. From the humans, the Goa'uld engineered the Jaffa, who serve as soldiers and incubators for their young. They also transplanted significant numbers of humans from Earth throughout the galaxy via the Stargate network to serve as slaves and potential hosts. After Ra's rule over Earth {{came to an end}} with a rebellion in the third millennium BC, after which the Stargate was buried in the ground to render it unusable, Earth was largely forgotten <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> never revisited; this is possibly because Earth contained no notable natural resources such as naqahdah, and the Goa'uld had already established sustainable human slave populations of sufficient size for genetic diversity elsewhere, obviating the need to return to our inconveniently distant planet. Earth passed into legend amongst the human and Jaffa populations of the galaxy, until the 20th century, when the Stargate was discovered and eventually activated.|$|E
500|$|... "Gold Coat" [...] was Chinese Nü Yrs lead single, {{released}} on 7 October 2015. Six days later, the label Brainfeeder announced they would release the EP on 30 October 2015. Two {{days before the}} release of the EP, [...] the music blog Pigeons & Planes premiered [...] "Xiangjiao". Iglooghost said the name of the record came from looking at the sky while flying back home from his gig in Rome: [...] "The sky looked really weird <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> the word Chinese New Year came into my head. I was really happy, because everything seemed super cool, life just seemed really warm and nice. I think the word Chinese New Year sounds warm and cool. I imagine fireworks, red colours and Chinese lanterns.” Upon its distribution, Chinese Nü Yr garnered positive reviews. Gary Suarez, reviewing for The Quietus, spotlighted the EP's [...] "mirthfully manic synthesis of garage, hip hop, footwork, and as-yet undefined (sub)genres" [...] that [...] "makes him a beatmaker to watch." [...] Both Ryce and Exclaim! critic Ashley Hampson praised Malliagh for making such a unique record while still fitting with the works of other acts on the Brainfeeder label.|$|E
500|$|The centrepiece of the {{coronation}} regalia {{is named after}} Edward the Confessor, and {{is placed on the}} monarch's head at the actual moment of crowning by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Made of gold in 1661, StEdward's Crown has four fleurs-de-lis and four crosses pattée with two depressed arches on top. Surmounting the arches is a jewelled monde and cross pattée. Its frame is embellished with 444 precious and semi-precious stones, including amethysts, garnets, peridots, rubies, sapphires, topazes, tourmalines and zircons. There has been speculation that it may incorporate gold from a medieval crown seized by Cromwell <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> not melted down. The crown is [...] tall, and at a weight of [...] it has been noted to be extremely heavy. After 1689, monarchs chose to be crowned with a lighter, bespoke coronation crown (e.g., the Coronation Crown of GeorgeIV) or their state crown. The tradition of using St Edward's Crown was revived in 1911 for {{the coronation}} of GeorgeV. In 1953, Queen ElizabethII opted to use a stylised image of this crown in coats of arms, badges, logos and various other insignia throughout the Commonwealth realms to symbolise her royal authority.|$|E

2500|$|Bull and Peel, {{by early}} 1867, had moved their {{operations}} on to Belmont, Nevada, {{and then to}} Salt Lake City, Utah. While in Salt Lake City, the two argued, {{and for a time}} separated. [...] However, by the summer of 1867 the two were working together again, by this time in Helena, Montana. On the night of July 22, 1867, Peel and Bull were seated {{at a table in the}} [...] "Greer Brothers Exchange Saloon", <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> the argument they had previously had was rekindled.

2500|$|There is {{something}} essential to some human personalities ... which we cannot plausibly construe solely {{in terms of}} either brain states, or properties of brain states ... and, further, after biological death this non-reducible essential trait sometimes persists for some time, in some way, in some place, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> or other, existing independently of the person's former brain and body. Moreover, after some time, some of these irreducible essential traits of human personality, for some reason or other, and by some mechanism or other, come to reside in other human bodies either some time during the gestation period, at birth, or shortly after birth.|$|E

2500|$|Carson {{often made}} jokes {{at the expense}} of other celebrities. In 1980, Carson backed out of a deal to acquire the Aladdin Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, and a {{competing}} group led by Wayne Newton successfully bought the property. According to lawyer Henry Bushkin, Carson became annoyed that he was often portrayed by the media as having [...] "lost" [...] the deal and reacted by telling jokes on his show about Newton, who had spent a great deal of effort building a masculine image. This created something of a high-profile feud between Carson and Newton. Years later, Newton appeared on Larry King Live, declaring that [...] "Johnny Carson is a mean-spirited human being. And there are people that he has hurt that people will never know about. <b>And</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> at some point, he decided to turn that kind of negative attention toward me. And I refused to have it." [...] Newton has often told of personally confronting Carson; after the final straw, Newton barged into his office at the studio and threatened to beat him up unless the jokes stopped. They did.|$|E
2500|$|Subsequently, in August 2012, {{producer}} Jim Beanz {{reported that}} Timberlake {{started working on}} his new music project. However, at that time, shortly after the announcement, Timberlake's publicist revealed {{that there were no}} current plans for a new Timberlake album, affirming instead that Timberlake was working with Timbaland on songs for his upcoming project Shock Value III. After the release of The 20/20 Experience, Wright confirmed that the album was finished in the middle of July and described it as a [...] "fast record". Timberlake had four weeks to record the whole material, because he had to shoot his scenes for the film Runner Runner. Although, originally planned for release in October 2012, the album's date was postponed because of the singer's wedding with actress Jessica Biel. Wright stated that although in the project were involved artists who are also primarily Timberlake's friends it was tough keeping the album a secret, making them use codenames for the project. During an interview with American radio and television host Ryan Seacrest, Timberlake explained the meaning behind the album's title saying, [...] "It more or less came out of: I was playing some of the stuff for my friends and they would come {{in and out of the}} studio and I'd say, 'What do you think of this?' And my best friend said, 'This is music that you can see,' <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> that stuck with me." ...|$|E
