5|$|Galland {{succeeded in}} {{temporarily}} persuading Milch to support cancelling the Me 209 program {{in favour of}} producing 100 Me 262s {{by the end of}} 1943. However, because of persistent problems with its turbojet engines and later, Hitler's determination {{to use it as a}} bomber, the Me 262 was not developed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fighter</b> until late in the war.|$|E
5|$|His success <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fighter</b> pilot {{also led}} to {{promotions}} and more responsibility as an officer. 1 May 1942 saw him receive an unusually early promotion to Oberleutnant followed by appointment to Staffelkapitän of 3./JG 27 on 8 June 1942, thus succeeding Oberleutnant Gerhard Homuth who took command of I./JG 27.|$|E

50|$|Grigorian rose to {{prominence}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> young <b>fighter</b> with <b>an</b> extensive record in his adopted country of Belgium. In {{perhaps the most}} notable bout of his early career, he featured <b>as</b> <b>a</b> reserve <b>fighter</b> at the S-Cup Europe 2008 in Gorinchem, Netherlands on September 20, 2008, where he defeated Abdallah Mabel by decision.|$|R

5|$|Bieksa {{was known}} as a two-way defenceman with the Canucks, capable of playing in all situations. Throughout his NHL career, he has been placed on {{shutdown}} pairing with such defensive partners as Willie Mitchell and Dan Hamhuis. Offensively, he regularly jumps into the rush and has led the Canucks in defensive scoring in 2006–07 and 2008–09. His play is characterized by aggressive and competitive components. He also earned a reputation <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fighter</b> early in his career in the AHL. However, Bieksa's scoring dropped off in his first season with the Ducks.He has been praised throughout his career for his leadership qualities.|$|E

5|$|Diane gives Marty {{a tape of}} Tommy's 1999 Olympic trial fight. Tommy {{was ahead}} after two rounds but quit before round three because of a hand injury. Marty realizes that Tommy faked his injury because of the poor {{coaching}} and abuse coming from his stepfather, who was serving as his cornerman. Marty and Tommy talk about Tommy's stepfather and Marty's former fighter. Marty tells Tommy that boxing is a team sport and that Tommy will never be alone in the ring. Tommy's renewed motivation <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fighter</b> leads to a reconciliation with Stephanie.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} this success, it was clear the Blenheim was simply {{not going to work}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fighter.</b> On several {{occasions}} the CH stations directed the fighters to a successful radar capture, only to have the target slowly pull away from the fighter. In one case the Blenheim was able to see the target, but when it spotted them the aircraft increased power and disappeared. From 1 to 15 October 1940 Mk. III-equipped fighters from RAF Kenley made 92 flights, performed 28 radar interceptions, and made zero kills.|$|E
25|$|Although outclassed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> day <b>fighter,</b> the F.E.2 proved very {{suitable}} for use at night and was used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> night <b>fighter</b> in home defence squadrons on anti-Zeppelin patrols and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> light tactical night bomber. It was first used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> night bomber in November 1916, with the first specialist F.E.2b night bomber squadrons being formed in February 1917. F.E.2bs were used as night bombers in eight bomber squadrons {{until the end of}} the First World War, with up to 860 being converted to, or built as bombers. Service <b>as</b> <b>a</b> night <b>fighter</b> was less successful, owing to the type's poor climb and ceiling.|$|R

5|$|Makriyannis, {{having been}} ignored by history, and hardly {{mentioned}} by chroniclers of the War of Independence, had {{renewed interest in}} the revolution by offering a significant personal testimony to historical research. Despite this, after the initial interest in the newly published Memoirs, they were hardly cited for almost 40 years. One could say that Makriyannis was forgotten, not only <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fighter,</b> but also {{as the author of}} a text written in Demotic Greek; a text that, besides reproducing the heroic atmosphere of the War of Independence, is also a treasure-house of linguistic knowledge concerning the common Greek tongue of the time.|$|E
5|$|Momchil {{achieved}} initial successes against Turks and Byzantines alike, setting Turkish ships on {{fire and}} almost managing to kill one of his main opponents at the time, John VI Kantakouzenos. Despite this, he was defeated and killed by a joint Byzantine–Turkish army in 1345. Due to {{his opposition to the}} Turks, he is remembered in popular South Slavic legend <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fighter</b> against the Turkish invasion of the Balkans.|$|E

50|$|The {{advantage}} of adapting existing aircraft {{was that the}} emergency fighter could be produced quickly. A variety of aircraft types were used: the Bristol Blenheim light bomber lacked performance in its intended role <b>as</b> <b>a</b> heavy day <b>fighter,</b> but found <b>a</b> useful niche <b>as</b> <b>a</b> strike <b>fighter</b> in Coastal Command and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> night <b>fighter,</b> pioneering the use of airborne intercept radar; the Russian Ilyushin Il-2 was occasionally used to escort other Shturmoviks on ground attack missions; and 26 British Miles Masters were produced, but never used, as the M.24 Master <b>fighter</b> with <b>a</b> single seat and six wing guns.|$|R
5|$|The game {{begins with}} {{character}} creation, where the player assigns attribute points (such as strength, intelligence, charisma) to The Nameless One. The Nameless One starts the game <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fighter,</b> but the player may later change his character class to thief or wizard, with {{the option to}} also change back to fighter, after finding corresponding tutors. The player may recruit adventuring companions {{over the course of}} the game; there are seven potential party members, but a maximum of five may accompany the player at any one time. Conversation is frequent among party members, occurring both randomly and during conversations with other non-player characters.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War, Davis continued to serve in the 71st Squadron and did not see combat in the initial phase of the war. As it progressed, however, Davis began training on the F-86 Sabre (Sabrejet), the latest jet engine-powered fighter. On February 15, 1951, he was promoted to major and in October 1951 he was assigned to the headquarters of the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing, which was based in Japan and operating aircraft throughout Korea. As such, Davis was sent to the conflict <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fighter</b> pilot.|$|E
5|$|Wood {{observed}} that {{the requirements of the}} specification were of a multi-role nature, akin to the Hawker Siddeley P.1154 and variable geometry General Dynamics F-111K. In RAF service, the AFVG had originally been intended to serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fighter,</b> replacing the English Electric Lightning in the interceptor mission. However, following the decision to procure the American-built McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II instead, the AFVG's expected role was changed in 1966 to supplementing the F-111K strike aircraft in replacing the English Electric Canberra and the V bomber force.|$|E

He was also an {{enthusiastic}} glider pilot and in 1937 he volunteered for military service in the Luftwaffe. Following training <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fighter</b> pilot, Wurmheller, holding the rank of Unteroffizier (sergeant), was posted to 2.

5|$|After the war, McNamara was {{stationed}} in Japan with No.82 Squadron, {{as part of the}} British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF). In 1949 he was posted to Headquarters North-Eastern Area for air traffic control work. He married Dorothy Miller on 27May 1950; the couple had two daughters. From 1951 to 1953, he served as an instructor at Central Flying School in East Sale, Victoria. Ranked squadron leader, he then saw operational service in the Korean War as the Executive Officer of No.77 Squadron, flying Gloster Meteors. Initially employed in the conflict <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fighter</b> unit, by this time No.77 Squadron's role was primarily ground attack, using the Meteors' cannon augmented by newly fitted rocket armament. McNamara briefly took charge of the unit in November–December 1953 when there was a hiatus between commanding officers rotating out and rotating in.|$|E
5|$|Born in Victoria of German origins, Scherger {{graduated}} from the Royal Military College, Duntroon, before transferring to the Air Force in 1925.

He held senior training posts in the late 1930s and the early years of World War II, earning the Air Force Cross in June 1940. Promoted to group captain, Scherger was acting commander of North-Western Area when Darwin suffered its first air raid in February 1942.
