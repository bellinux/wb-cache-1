50|$|Chalkware is an American {{term for}} popular figurines either made of moulded plaster of Paris (usually) or sculpted gypsum, and painted, {{typically}} with oils or watercolors.

Those created during the earlier period were intended as <b>a</b> more serious <b>decorative</b> art, often imitating the more expensive imported English Staffordshire potteries figurines such as Staffordshire dog figurines; those during the second period, by contrast, were more typically somewhat jocular. Early chalkware was often hollow and is difficult to find unblemished.|$|R

2500|$|Around 1917, Daniel McFarlan Moore, {{then working}} at the General Electric Company, {{developed}} the miniature neon lamp. The glow lamp has a very different design than the much larger neon tubes used for signage; the difference was sufficient that a separate US patent was issued for the lamp in 1919. A Smithsonian Institution website notes, [...] "These small, low power devices use a physical principle called [...] "coronal discharge." [...] Moore mounted two electrodes close together in a bulb and added neon or argon gas. The electrodes would glow brightly in red or blue, depending on the gas, and the lamps lasted for years. Since the electrodes could take almost any shape imaginable, a popular application has been fanciful <b>decorative</b> <b>lamps.</b> Glow lamps found practical use as electronic components, and as indicators in instrument panels and in many home appliances until the acceptance of Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs) starting in the 1970s." ...|$|R
