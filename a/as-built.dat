5|$|In March 2015, Hornby {{announced}} {{the inclusion of}} a new <b>as-built</b> version of the class in OO gauge in their 2016 range; this model was subsequently postponed to the 2017 range.|$|E
5|$|The Merchant Navy {{class has}} been the subject of several models by {{different}} manufacturers, including Hornby Railways, Graham Farish and Minitrix. The first OO gauge model of an <b>as-built</b> locomotive was produced by Graham Farish in 1950 followed by Hornby/Wrenn in 1962 and by the modified version.|$|E
5|$|Bergen Street is {{laid out}} similar to other subway {{stations}} located below narrow streets, with two levels. The upper level—the only one used in regular service—serves local trains, while the lower level has formerly seen express service. As {{a result of the}} station's proximity to ground level, {{there is no room for}} a mezzanine, making it one of only three <b>as-built</b> express stations in the system that do not allow free transfers between directions. As a result passengers wishing to transfer from a Brooklyn-bound G to a Manhattan-bound F, and vice versa, cannot do so at this station.|$|E
5|$|The {{result was}} an {{operational}} period of only eight years. This unique locomotive was saved from being scrapped at Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales {{when it was}} purchased {{by a group of}} railway enthusiasts who restored it from scrapyard to <b>as-built</b> condition in 13 years. Since then, modifications have been made to the original design, resulting {{in one of the most}} efficient and powerful steam locomotives ever to run in Britain. As a result, the Duke of Gloucester can frequently be seen on the mainline around Britain.|$|E

500|$|Due to the {{problems}} experienced with the class, and following {{the success of the}} rebuilt Merchant Navy class designed by R. G. Jarvis, British Railways ordered the rebuilding of sixty locomotives to a more conventional design at Eastleigh between 1957 and 1961. The first locomotive to be rebuilt was No. 34005 Barnstaple, which adopted many features from the BR 'Standard' locomotive classes. The casing was removed and replaced with conventional boiler cladding, boiler pressure reduced to [...] and the chain-driven valve gear was replaced with modified Walschaerts valve gear fitted both outside as well as between the frames. The rapid onset of the 1955 Modernisation Plan during the early 1960s meant that the remaining fifty locomotives were not rebuilt, and continued in <b>as-built</b> condition until withdrawal.|$|E
500|$|After withdrawal, the [...] "Duke" [...] was {{initially}} {{selected for the}} National Collection, though it was later decided that only the cylinder arrangement was of interest. One of the outside cylinders was removed for display at the Science Museum; the other was removed to restore balance in readiness for scrapping. The locomotive was purchased by Dai Woodham, though it {{was initially}} sent to the wrong scrapyard. After retrieval, the [...] "Duke" [...] languished {{for many years in}} Woodham Brothers scrapyard at Barry Island, South Wales, before enthusiasts purchased the locomotive in 1974, forming the Duke of Gloucester Steam Locomotive Trust. [...] Restoration began in earnest, though with many components missing, the most expensive of which being the Caprotti valve gear, it took 13 years of {{effort on the part of}} enthusiasts, with assistance in the guise of sponsorships from industry, to return the locomotive to near <b>as-built</b> condition. One of the very few compromises made was replacing the previous steel cylinders with spheroidal graphite iron.|$|E
500|$|The {{class in}} both <b>as-built</b> and {{modified}} forms has {{been subject to}} a range of divergent opinions. The utilisation of welded steel construction and the various innovations that had not previously been seen in British locomotive design meant that the class earned Bulleid the title [...] "Last Giant of Steam". The constant concern for ease of maintenance and utility had not previously been seen on locomotives of older design, whilst their highly efficient boilers represented the ultimate in British steam technology, the hallmark of a successful locomotive design. Despite this, the number of innovations introduced at the same time made the class unreliable and difficult to maintain during {{the first few years of}} service. Many of these difficulties were overcome during the rebuilding, leading to D.L. Bradley's statement that the modified locomotives were [...] "the finest express locomotives to work in the country". Overall, the class was largely successful, with half of the locomotives completing more than 1 million miles in revenue-earning service.|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} {{to preserve a}} member of the class was made in November 1960. It was first intended to preserve the King Arthur class doyen No.453 King Arthur, and it was stored for a time after withdrawal in 1961 pending restoration to museum condition. However, it was decided to restore the preserved locomotive to <b>as-built</b> condition, and the lack of a suitable Drummond [...] "watercart" [...] tender precluded this consideration. No.453 was subsequently scrapped and it was decided to preserve one of the North British-built batch, No.30777 Sir Lamiel, withdrawn in October 1961, instead. Sir Lamiel was named after a character in Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, Sir Lamiel of Cardiff. This locomotive was restored to Maunsell livery as No.E777, and became part of the National Collection. It was restored to the later British Railways livery in 2003, and No.30777 can be seen at the Great Central Railway and on the railway network hauling mainline railtours as of 2010.|$|E
500|$|Ten of {{the eleven}} {{preserved}} merchant navy's ended up at Barry Scrapyard with one engine, 35028 Clan Line being bought by the Merchant Navy Locomotive Preservation Society direct from British Railways service in 1967, and has since been regarded as the 'flagship' of the class. [...] Although eleven {{members of the class}} have survived into the preservation era, it is very likely that many will never steam again, with only five having run in preservation thus far. This is because the class is too large and heavy for use on most of today's heritage railways. As the entire class was rebuilt from 1956 onwards, no Merchant Navy class locomotives exist in <b>as-built</b> condition, although a team are attempting to reverse-engineer 35011 General Steam Navigation to original condition. Other relics of the class have survived in the guise of locomotive nameplates and smokebox number plates, which were taken from their locomotives towards the end of steam on the British Railways Southern Region in the 1960s. As a result, many exist in private collections and several have been seen at auctions, selling for several thousands of pounds.|$|E

2500|$|One other set {{was briefly}} {{preserved}} until 2010 {{when it was}} scrapped, 3822, was located at the Churnet Valley Railway and was partially restored. In 2008 half of the set was returned to <b>as-built</b> BR Blue and received internal repairs. The other half remained in [...] "as withdrawn" [...] Connex condition, and the set operated at several special events throughout that year.|$|E

2500|$|Lutyens {{originally}} designed a cenotaph for Southend, following his {{example of the}} Cenotaph on Whitehall in London, arguably his most famous memorial. The memorial <b>as-built</b> {{is in the form}} of an obelisk flanked by stone flags and surrounded on three sides by a low screen wall. It is approached from the north by a set of six stone steps, similar to Lutyens' design for the North Eastern Railway War Memorial in York. The memorial was unveiled by Lord Lambourne, the Lord Lieutenant of Essex and dedicated by the Bishop of Colchester on 27 November 1921. It was designated a Grade II listed building in 1974 and upgraded to Grade II* in 2015, when Lutyens' memorials were recognised as a [...] "national collection".|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the course}} of any {{construction}} project, the work scope may change. Change is a normal and expected part of the construction process. Changes can {{be the result of}} necessary design modifications, differing site conditions, material availability, contractor-requested changes, value engineering and impacts from third parties, to name a few. Beyond executing the change in the field, the change normally needs to be documented to show what was actually constructed. This is referred to as change management. Hence, the owner usually requires a final record to show all changes or, more specifically, any change that modifies the tangible portions of the finished work. The record is made on the contract documents – usually, but not necessarily limited to, the design drawings. The end product of this effort is what the industry terms <b>as-built</b> drawings, or more simply, [...] "as built." [...] The requirement for providing them is a norm in construction contracts. Construction document management is a highly important task undertaken with the aid an online or desktop software system, or maintained through physical documentation. The increasing legality pertaining to the construction industries maintenance of correct documentation has caused the increase in the need for document management systems.|$|E
2500|$|There were {{extensive}} {{discussions about}} the armament, the /25 caliber anti-aircraft (AA) gun being favored as being easy to work and train in a fast moving and lively type of ship. The other candidate was the 5-inch/51 caliber surface type, being very powerful but all but useless against aircraft. [...] It was a discussion made more interesting as the 5-inch/38 caliber dual purpose gun became available in the early 1930s and the Ordnance Department favored it rather strongly. The 5-inch/38 gun was simply a 5-inch/25 gun with the same projectiles and a longer barrel, but that significantly increased its range against both air and surface targets. The class was originally built with eight Mk 12 5-inch/38 caliber guns in four Mark 22 single purpose (surface action only) twin enclosed mounts; the single purpose weapons were adopted to save weight. Anti-aircraft protection was provided by two quadruple 1.1-inch (28 mm) mounts; in the 1930s this was considered sufficient. Although the Porters had the same eight [...] torpedo tubes as the Farraguts, {{a full set of}} reloads was carried. The class was initially equipped with the Mark 11 torpedo or Mark 12 torpedo, which were replaced by the Mark 15 torpedo beginning in 1938. The heavy armament proved to be top-heavy, and aircraft were becoming a greater threat, so during World War II on most of the class, mounts 51 and 54 were replaced with dual purpose (surface action and air action) twin mounts, and the original 1.1-inch guns were replaced with 40 mm Bofors and 20 mm Oerlikon weapons. [...] In some ships, mount 52 was replaced by a quad 40mm mount, and mount 53 became a single 5in/38 cal dual purpose mount for a total of five 5-inch dual purpose guns. [...] Additional 40mm guns were added amidships along with 20mm weapons. On most ships four K-gun depth charge throwers were added to augment the <b>as-built</b> pair of depth charge racks. In some cases late in the war, (DD-357, DD-359, DD-360) the torpedo tubes, two K-guns, and one depth charge rack were removed to accommodate additional light AA armament, for a total of sixteen 40 mm cannons in three quad and two twin mounts and four 20 mm in two twin mounts.|$|E
