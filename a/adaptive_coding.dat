This class of codes has been presented in [Dragos Trinca, cs. DS/ 0505007] as {{a new class of}} non-standard variable-length <b>codes.</b> Generalized <b>adaptive</b> <b>codes</b> (GA codes, for short) have been also presented in [Dragos Trinca, cs. DS/ 0505007] not only as a new class of non-standard variable-length codes, but also as a natural generalization of <b>adaptive</b> <b>codes</b> of any order. This paper is intended to continue developing the theory of variable-length codes by establishing several interesting connections between <b>adaptive</b> <b>codes</b> and other classes of codes. The connections are discussed not only from a theoretical point of view (by proving new results), but also from an applicative one (by proposing several applications). First, we prove that adaptive Huffman encodings and Lempel-Ziv encodings are particular cases of encodings by GA codes. Second, we show that any (n, 1,m) convolutional code satisfying certain conditions can be modelled as an <b>adaptive</b> <b>code</b> of order m. Third, we describe a cryptographic scheme based on the connection between <b>adaptive</b> <b>codes</b> and convolutional codes, and present an insightful analysis of this scheme. Finally, we conclude by generalizing <b>adaptive</b> <b>codes</b> to (p,q) -adaptive codes, and discussing connections between <b>adaptive</b> <b>codes</b> and time-varying codes.

40|$|<b>Adaptive</b> video <b>coding</b> {{algorithms}} are {{digital video}} compression algorithms that can adapt the encoding {{of a video}} stream dynamically based {{on the amount of}} bandwidth available on the network. While such algorithms are more complicated than traditional video coding algorithms, they are attractive because of their inherent robustness to changes in network load (i. e., network congestion). <b>Adaptive</b> video <b>coding</b> algorithms seem particularly suitable for high speed network environments, such as B-ISDN/ATM, that offer Available Bit Rate (ABR) services. The goal {{of this paper is to}} assess the role that <b>adaptive</b> video <b>coding</b> algorithms will play in future high speed networks. The paper presents a simple mathematical model and analysis of several hypothetical video coding algorithms for high speed networks, and a simulation study of one such <b>adaptive</b> video <b>coding</b> algorithm that we have implemented in a local area network environment. The results show that <b>adaptive</b> video <b>coding</b> algorithms are indeed robust across a wide range of network loads. More importantly, however, the results suggest that the domain of <b>adaptive</b> video <b>coding</b> algorithms is quite narrow: moderately to heavily loaded networks with speeds on the order of 10 Mbps and 100 Mbps. As a result, <b>adaptive</b> video <b>coding</b> algorithms will likely play only a limited role in future high speed networks. ...|$|R

In purpose of finding the optimal number of classes, the increment of the <b>adaptive</b> <b>code</b> length is suggested to be the similarity measure between two conditional probability distributions, by which the similarity matrix is constructed as the input of the affinity propagation algorithm. After the given number of iterations, the optimal quantizer with the optimal number of classes is achieved and the <b>adaptive</b> <b>code</b> length is minimized at the same time. The simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that are better than the results obtained by the minimum conditional entropy context quantization implemented by K-means with lower computational complexity...|$|R
50|$|<b>Adaptive</b> <b>coding</b> {{refers to}} {{variants}} of entropy encoding methods of lossless data compression. They are particularly suited to streaming data, as they adapt to localized {{changes in the}} characteristics of the data, and don't require a first pass over the data to calculate a probability model. The cost paid for these advantages is that the encoder and decoder must be more complex to keep their states synchronized, and more computational power is needed to keep adapting the encoder/decoder state.|$|E
50|$|In <b>adaptive</b> <b>coding,</b> the encoder and decoder are instead {{equipped}} with a predefined meta-model about how they will alter their models {{in response to the}} actual content of the data, and otherwise start with a blank slate, meaning that no initial model needs to be transmitted. As the data is transmitted, both encoder and decoder adapt their models, so that unless the character of the data changes radically, the model becomes better-adapted to the data it is handling and compresses it more efficiently approaching the efficiency of the static coding.|$|E

Whereas a Golomb code has a tunable parameter that can be any positive integer value, Rice codes are those in which the tunable parameter is a power of two. This makes Rice codes convenient for use on a computer since multiplication and division by 2 can be implemented more efficiently in binary arithmetic.|$|E

The rules of the initialized centers chosen for K-means are also discussed. The proposed algorithm will traverse all possible number of the classes to search the optimal one which is corresponding to the shortest <b>adaptive</b> <b>code</b> length.

50|$|A {{generalization}} of Thompson sampling to arbitrary dynamical environments and causal structures, known as Bayesian control rule, {{has been shown}} to be the optimal solution to the <b>adaptive</b> <b>coding</b> problem with actions and observations. In this formulation, an agent is conceptualized as a mixture over a set of behaviours. As the agent interacts with its environment, it learns the causal properties and adopts the behaviour that minimizes the relative entropy to the behaviour with the best prediction of the environment's behaviour. If these behaviours have been chosen according to the maximum expected utility principle, then the asymptotic behaviour of the Bayesian control rule matches the asymptotic behaviour of the perfectly rational agent.|$|E

40|$|Our {{ability to}} {{discriminate}} and recognize thousands of faces despite their similarity as visual patterns relies on adaptive, norm-based, coding mechanisms that are continuously updated by experience. Reduced <b>adaptive</b> <b>coding</b> of face identity {{has been proposed}} as a neurocognitive endophenotype for autism, because it is found in autism and in relatives of individuals with autism. Autistic traits can also extend continuously into the general population, raising the possibility that reduced <b>adaptive</b> <b>coding</b> of face identity may be more generally associated with autistic traits. In the present study, we investigated whether <b>adaptive</b> <b>coding</b> of face identity decreases as autistic traits increase in an undergraduate population. <b>Adaptive</b> <b>coding</b> was measured using face identity aftereffects, and autistic traits were measured using the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) and its subscales.

We found that men who scored higher on levels of autistic traits related to social interaction had reduced <b>adaptive</b> <b>coding</b> of face identity. This result {{is consistent with the}} idea that atypical adaptive face-coding mechanisms are an endophenotype for autism. Autistic traits were also linked with face-selective recognition difficulties in men. However, there were some unexpected sex differences. In women, autistic traits were linked positively, rather than negatively, with <b>adaptive</b> <b>coding</b> of identity, and were unrelated to face-selective recognition difficulties. These sex differences indicate that autistic traits can have different neurocognitive correlates in men and women and raise the intriguing possibility that endophenotypes of autism can differ in males and females...|$|E
40|$|To {{efficiently}} {{represent all}} of the possible rewards in the world, dopaminergic midbrain neurons dynamically adapt their coding range to the momentarily available rewards.
