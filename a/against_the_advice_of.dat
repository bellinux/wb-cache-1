5|$|The {{sovereign}} {{does not}} have the power to withhold assent from a bill <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> ministers. The last bill that was refused assent by the sovereign (on the advice of ministers) was the Scottish Militia Bill during Queen Anne's reign in 1708.|$|E
5|$|After the Democratic Party's {{takeover}} of Congress, Bush allegedly delegated {{the responsibility for}} finding a new strategy almost solely to National Security Adviser Stephen J. Hadley and deputy National Security Adviser Meghan L. O’Sullivan. <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> {{the vast majority of}} his staff and other administration officials, Bush finally decided on the 'surge' strategy devised by retired General Jack Keane and General David H. Petraeus. The book describes deep in fighting within the administration.|$|E

5|$|Burnside, <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> the president, prematurely {{launched}} an offensive across the Rappahannock River and was stunningly defeated by Lee at Fredericksburg in December. Not only had Burnside been defeated on the battlefield, but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined. Desertions during 1863 {{were in the}} thousands and they increased after Fredericksburg. Lincoln brought in Joseph Hooker, despite his record of loose talk {{about the need for}} a military dictatorship.|$|E
5|$|By February, the Germans were in full retreat. On February 23, 1945, the U.S. 94th Infantry Division {{crossed the}} Saar and {{established}} a vital bridgehead at Serrig through which Patton pushed units into the Saarland. Patton had insisted upon an immediate crossing of the Saar River <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> his officers. Historians such as Charles Whiting have criticized this strategy as unnecessarily aggressive.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{informed}} Baldwin that {{he would}} abdicate {{if he could not}} marry Simpson. Baldwin then presented Edward with three choices: give up the idea of marriage; marry against his ministers' wishes; or abdicate. It was clear that Edward was not prepared to give up Simpson, and he knew that if he married <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> his ministers, he would cause the government to resign, prompting a constitutional crisis. He chose to abdicate.|$|E

5|$|Here, Brock met Tecumseh, and was {{immediately}} impressed. Brock also read American dispatches captured from Hull's army. He quickly judged Hull to be timid and afraid of the First Nations in particular, and the American force to be demoralised and short of rations. <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> his officers, Brock immediately prepared to launch an attack on Detroit.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the many}} factors in his success was Como's insistence on his {{principles}} of good taste; if he considered something to be in bad or questionable taste, {{it was not in}} the show or broadcast. When a remark made by Julius La Rosa about television personality Arthur Godfrey on The Perry Como Show was misconstrued, Como offered an on-air apology {{at the beginning of his}} next show, <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> his staff.|$|E

50|$|When {{approached}} by Ang Katotohanan, Nicolas Zamora accepted <b>the</b> leadership <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> and importuning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Americans. After some preparation, the group established the Iglesia Evangelica Metodista en las Islas Filipinas on 28 February 1909. Their vision and motivation was faith in God’s providence, and {{belief that the}} Filipino was capable of erecting a self-sustaining, autonomous, and self-propagating evangelical church.|$|R
5|$|<b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> Captain Dove, Paxton {{continued}} {{to advance the}} regiment. The element of surprise was gone, and it was dark. Dove knew the probability of being attacked was high, and he took steps to minimize the danger to the main column. The advance guard was ambushed around 1:00 am on May 2. Dove received a severe wound on his foot, {{and two of his}} men were killed. The regiment's total losses were four killed, eight wounded, and four missing—plus 28 horses killed. Paxton, who was popular with the regiment, was dismissed by General Eliakim P. Scammon after the regiment returned to camp.|$|E

5|$|Ark Royal {{was pressed}} into service, {{delivering}} aircraft to Malta during several supply runs throughout June and July, and escorting the convoys of Operation Substance in July and Operation Halberd in September. Despite some losses, the convoys succeeded in keeping Malta supplied and fighting. The continued Allied presence in Malta was a considerable problem for Rommel in Africa, who was losing {{as much as}} ⅓ of his supplies from Italy to submarines and bombers based there. Adolf Hitler decided to send a flotilla of U-boats into the Mediterranean to attack Allied shipping, <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> Großadmiral Raeder.|$|E
40|$|Within {{one week}} of his {{election}} to {{the presidency of the}} Fifth Republic de Gaulle had taken a number of decisions which were to lay the basis for the foreign and economic policies pursued throughout his tenure of office. Contrary to all expectations de Gaulle confirmed his support for the European Economic Community, <b>against</b> <b>the</b> initial <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> his ministers he devalued the franc, and at variance with his partners in the EEC he vetoed Britain's plans to set up a free trade area in Europe.

30|$|Although around 60 % of {{respondents}} claimed to routinely advise patients {{of the risk}} for all {{or at least some}} procedures, over 21 % only sometimes advise of the risks and a worrying 16 % would only rarely or just occasionally inform patients. Alarmingly, a minority (1.6 %) claimed they would never inform patients of the risks. This is <b>against</b> <b>the</b> current <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NHSLA [27]. Many patients will use the Internet to find out information about the procedure they are to undergo. If they then experience adhesion-related complications, they may seek legal advice and if they have not been warned about the risks then there {{is more likely to be}} a problem.|$|R
5|$|Between 1945 and 1950 the US {{fleet of}} battleships had been entirely decommissioned; however, Missouri was spared this fate {{due to the}} {{influence}} of President Harry S. Truman, a native Missourian, who refused to allow the battleship to be decommissioned, and <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson, Secretary of the Navy John L. Sullivan, and Chief of Naval Operations Louis E. Denfeld, Truman ordered Missouri to be maintained with the active fleet partly because of his fondness for the battleship and partly because the battleship had been christened by his daughter. As a result, Missouri was involved in various training and flag waving exercises at home and abroad between World War II and the Korean War.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, Breckinridge's wife Ann died.

He was offered pastorate of the Second Presbyterian Church of Lexington, Kentucky, but instead, accepted the presidency of Jefferson College in Pennsylvania in 1845 <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> his brothers John and William. A rift between Breckinridge and his brother Cabell's widow and other relatives may help account for this surprising decision. He did not feel he could yet return to his home state.|$|E

5|$|Prerogative {{powers were}} {{formerly}} exercised by the monarch acting {{on his or}} her own initiative.

Police originally theorized that two men were involved in the murders, but this was discounted once Chandler was arrested. Following his conviction, Chandler was incarcerated at Union Correctional Institution, and, during his seventeen years of incarceration until his execution, he was notable for not having had a single visitor.|$|E
5|$|This freelancing attempt did {{not start}} out well, with Benchley selling just one piece to Vanity Fair and accumulating countless {{rejections}} in two months. When a position as press agent for Broadway producer William A. Brady was offered, Benchley accepted it, <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> many of his peers. This experience was a poor one, as Brady was extremely difficult to work for. Benchley resigned to become a publicity director for the federal government's Aircraft Board {{at the beginning of}} 1918. His experience there was not much better, and when an opportunity was offered to return to the Tribune under new editorial management, Benchley took it.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the opening}} day of the Church of Scotland's General Assembly, Thursday 21 May, an attempt was made to change the order of {{business}} by hearing the Locharran-Skye overture before <b>the</b> Rennie case, <b>against</b> <b>the</b> legal <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Overture and Appeals Committee. [...] The attempt to change the order of business was interpreted by some as being designed to strengthen the cause of those opposed to Rennie's appointment. Speaking to his motion, Peter Parks argued that it would be illogical to decide a specific case without having already established <b>the</b> principle <b>against</b> which <b>the</b> case would be tested. The General Assembly was unconvinced and comfortably defeated Parks's motion, having been persuaded that it would be unjust to hear the overture first due to the danger of anachronism.|$|R
500|$|With {{the help}} of fresh seal meat which halted the ravages of scurvy, the {{survivors}} slowly recovered at Hut Point. The unstable condition of the sea ice in McMurdo Sound prevented them from completing the journey to the Cape Evans base.

On 8 May 1916, after carrying out reconnaissance {{on the state of the}} sea ice, Mackintosh announced that he and Hayward were prepared to risk the walk to Cape Evans. <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> urgent <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> their comrades, they set off, carrying only light supplies.|$|R
