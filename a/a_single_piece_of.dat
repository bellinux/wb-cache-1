5|$|The main {{advantage}} of composite bows over self bows (made from <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> wood) is their combination of smaller size with high power. They are therefore more convenient than self bows when the archer is mobile, as from horseback, {{or from a}} chariot. Almost all composite bows are also recurve bows as the shape curves away from the archer; this design gives higher draw-weight {{in the early stages}} of the archer's draw, storing somewhat more total energy for a given final draw-weight. It would be possible to make a wooden bow that has the same shape, length and draw-weight as a traditional composite bow, but it could not store the energy, and would break before full draw.|$|E
5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> elastic cartilage with a complicated relief on its inner surface and a fairly smooth configuration on its posterior surface. A tubercle, known as Darwin's tubercle, is sometimes present, {{lying in the}} descending part of the helix and corresponding to the ear-tip of mammals. The earlobe {{consists of}} areola and adipose tissue. The symmetrical arrangement of the two ears allows for the localisation of sound. The brain accomplishes this by comparing arrival-times and intensities from each ear, in circuits located in the superior olivary complex and the trapezoid bodies which are connected via pathways to both ears.|$|E
5|$|Temnospondyls' {{vertebrae}} {{are divided}} into several segments. In living tetrapods, {{the main body of}} the vertebra is <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> bone called the centrum, but in temnospondyls, this region was divided into a pleurocentrum and intercentrum. Two types of vertebrae are recognized in temnospondyls: stereospondylous and rhachitomous vertebrae.'In rhachitomous vertebrae, the intercentra are large and wedge-shaped, and the pleurocentra are relatively small blocks that fit between them.' Both elements support a spine-like neural arch, and well-developed interlocking projections called zygapophyses strengthen the connections between vertebrae. The strong backbone and strong limbs of many ratchitomous temnospondyls allowed them to be partially, and in some cases fully, terrestrial. In stereospondylous vertebrae, the pleurocentra have been lost entirely, with the intercentra enlarged as {{the main body of the}} vertebrae. This weaker type of backbone indicates that stereospondylous temnospondyls spent more time in water.|$|E

5|$|The {{stocks and}} sails were {{made during the}} two work-ins held in July and August, a total of 41 people {{attending}} over the two weeks. A second-hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and preserved at the mill, but upon examination it {{was found to be}} unfit for use. Thus two new stocks were required instead of one. Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and durability grounds, leaving two options. Traditional stocks made from <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> timber, or laminated stocks. Good quality pitch pine was not obtainable in the lengths required. Douglas fir was obtainable in such lengths but was discounted on strength and durability grounds. A Douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had rotted after only seven years. Thus it was decided that laminated stocks would be made.|$|E
5|$|The programmers {{suggested}} using 3D Studio Max for art {{and level}} design, which would {{save money by}} allowing the company to license <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> software, but the lead artists successfully lobbied against this plan, believing that allowing the respective teams to choose the software {{would allow them to}} work most efficiently. Huebner said this saved the project more time than any other decision made during development. The level designers chose QERadiant to take advantage of their previous experience using the software while working on Id Software's Quake series. Id allowed Nihilistic to license QERadiant and modify it to create a customized tool for its 3D environments. Because QERadiant was a finished, functional tool, it allowed the level designers to begin developing levels from the project's start and then export them into the NOD engine, rather than waiting for up to six months for Nihilistic to develop a custom tool or learning a new 3D level editor. In twenty-four months, the three level designers built over 100 in-game environments for Redemption. They obtained blueprints and sketches of buildings from medieval Prague and Vienna to better represent that period and locations. The four-person art team led by Kraaijvanger used Alias Wavefront Maya to create 3D art. Nihilistic's management wanted Kraaijvanger to use a less expensive tool but relented when the cost was found to be lower than had been thought. Throughout the project, the art team built over 1,500 3D models.|$|E

5000|$|The idea of {{creating}} a thinner, lighter lens by making it with separate sections mounted in a frame is often attributed to Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon. [...] The marquis de Condorcet (1743-1794) proposed grinding such a lens from <b>a</b> <b>single</b> thin <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> glass.|$|R
25|$|A {{solid wood}} floor is a floor laid with planks or battens created from <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> timber, usually a hardwood. Since wood is hydroscopic (it acquires and loses {{moisture}} from the ambient conditions around it) this potential instability effectively limits the length and width of the boards.|$|E
25|$|Piecing: Sewing {{small pieces}} of cloth into patterns, called blocks, that are then sewn {{together}} to make a finished quilt top. These blocks may be sewn together, edge to edge, or separated by strips of cloth called sashing. Note: Whole cloth quilts typically are not pieced, but are made using <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> cloth for the quilt top.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{its lack}} of influence, certain critics view Milton's God as {{by far the best}} {{sustained}} work of criticism on the poem by a 20th-century critic. Harold Bloom includes it {{as one of the few}} critical works worthy of canonical status in his The Western Canon (where it is also the only critical work concerned solely with <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> literature).|$|E

25|$|The {{subsequent}} directives 2001/12/EC, 2001/13/EC and 2001/14/EC, which {{built upon}} the initial legislation, are collectively {{known as the}} First Railway Package. In September 2010, the process of merging the directives into <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> legislation was begun, {{with the addition of}} modifications to strengthen the regulatory framework. The Second Railway Package and the Third Railway Package aimed to push integration further.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Atelier Ted Noten and UK {{creative}} company Laikingland {{designed a}} modern-day jewellery box called Lady Killer Vol. 1. It {{is made by}} 3D printing techniques and comprises a robotic arm that grabs and presents <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> stored jewellery. The gold-plated Lady Killer ring designed for this project has on top a miniature gun with a white and a black diamond.|$|E
25|$|These {{instruments}} {{usually have}} some 20–23 strings and are handmade, and often differ {{from each other}} in form and number of strings. The backs are usually hewn out of <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> wood. Wooden pegs hold the strings, which are tuned diatonically. Traditionally, these instruments had gut strings; however, {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century common performance practice changed over to steel strings.|$|E
50|$|A {{guillotine}} lock {{is a type}} of canal lock. The lock itself {{operates on}} the same principle as any normal pound lock, but is unusual in that each gate is <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>piece,</b> usually <b>of</b> steel, that slides vertically upwards when opened to allow a boat to traverse underneath. The resemblance to the French guillotine is obvious.|$|R
50|$|A {{monolith}} is a geological feature {{consisting of}} <b>a</b> <b>single</b> massive stone or rock, such as some mountains, or <b>a</b> <b>single</b> large <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> rock placed as, or within, a monument or building. Erosion usually exposes the geological formations, {{which are often}} made of very hard and solid igneous or metamorphic rock.|$|R
50|$|A {{compiler}} for {{a relatively}} simple language written by one person might be <b>a</b> <b>single,</b> monolithic <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> software. However, as the source language grows in complexity the design may be split {{into a number of}} interdependent phases. Separate phases provide design improvements that focus development on the functions in the compilation process.|$|R
