50|$|Charles F. Brush {{assembled}} {{his first}} dynamo {{in the summer}} of 1876 using a horse-drawn treadmill to power it. Brush's design modified the Gramme dynamo by shaping the ring armature like a disc rather than a cylinder shape. The field electromagnets were also positioned {{on the sides of the}} <b>armature</b> <b>disc</b> rather than around the circumference.|$|E
5|$|A {{more recent}} {{development}} is the electric action which uses low voltage DC to control the key and/or stop mechanisms. Electricity may control the action indirectly through air pressure valves (pneumatics), {{in which case the}} action is electro-pneumatic. In such actions, an electromagnet attracts a small pilot valve which lets wind go to a bellows ("pneumatic") which opens the pallet. When electricity operates the action directly without the assistance of pneumatics, it is commonly referred to as direct electric action. In this type, the electromagnet's <b>armature</b> carries a <b>disc</b> pallet.|$|R
2500|$|Bell {{exhibited}} a working telephone at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in June 1876, where it {{attracted the attention}} of Brazilian emperor Pedro II plus the physicist and engineer Sir William Thomson (who would later be ennobled as the 1st Baron Kelvin). In August 1876 {{at a meeting of the}} British Association for the Advancement of Science, Thomson revealed the telephone to the European public. In describing his visit to the Philadelphia Exhibition, Thomson said, [...] "I heard [...] passages taken at random from the New York newspapers: 'S.S. Cox Has Arrived' (I failed to make out the S.S. Cox); 'The City of New York', 'Senator Morton', 'The Senate Has Resolved To Print A Thousand Extra Copies', 'The Americans In London Have Resolved To Celebrate The Coming Fourth Of July!' All this my own ears heard spoken to me with unmistakable distinctness by the then circular <b>disc</b> <b>armature</b> of just such another little electro-magnet as this I hold in my hand." ...|$|R
