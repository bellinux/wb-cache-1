By then the government had increased the post-Olympic fund to NOK200 million. Ownership of the Hamar and Gjøvik venues had previously been transferred to the respective municipal governments. The fund was established in September and is managed by a separate foundation, Stiftelsen Lillehammer Etterbruksfond. <b>Additional</b> <b>capital</b> for the fund was secured through LOOC's financial buffers not being used and the surplus transferred to the funds.

5|$|The new {{business}} model required <b>additional</b> <b>capital.</b> To this end, {{the company was}} sold to Banner Productions in 1965, with Gottschalk remaining as president. Panavision would soon expand into markets beyond Hollywood, eventually including New York, Europe, Australia, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia. Kinney National Company bought out Banner in 1968 and took over Warner Bros.-Seven Arts the following year, eventually renaming itself Warner Communications due to a financial scandal. Kinney/Warner's financial resources made possible a massive expansion in Panavision's inventory, as well as substantial leaps in research and development.|$|E

This agreement is the largest single franchise agreement {{in the history of}} Burger King and will make the new Chinese venture the largest BK franchise in the world. The agreement gives the new franchise group control of the existing 63 locations in the country. The expansion has both pluses and minuses for Burger King, as a minor player in the market it yet to truly establish a brand identity as McDonald's and Yum!

5|$|Up to {{this point}} the Redman {{investment}} {{had not been a}} notable success: in the decade to 1934, despite an <b>additional</b> <b>capital</b> injection by Churchill, the business had made losses in half of the years, and in only one of the other years had it made any more than a modest profit. However, growth was steady after 1934, with profits of £23,000, £38,000, £54,000 and then a large jump to £139,000 in 1938. By 1939 the Redman operation alone employed 300 people, compared to around 30 in 1920. Motor industry expansion assisted in this growth, with Ford becoming a customer and Gabriel setting up a new machine tool division at Coventry Road, South Yardley, Birmingham, in 1938 to give easy access for the industry's centre, but rearmament was the most significant factor.|$|E

5|$|Spain had a {{comparatively}} low debt level among advanced economies {{prior to the}} crisis. Its public debt relative to GDP in 2010 was only 60%, more than 20 points less than Germany, France or the US, and more than 60 points less than Italy, Ireland or Greece. Debt was largely avoided by the ballooning tax revenue from the housing bubble, which helped accommodate a decade of increased government spending without debt accumulation. When the bubble burst, Spain spent {{large amounts of money}} on bank bailouts. In May 2012, Bankia received a 19 billion euro bailout, on top of the previous 4.5 billion euros to prop up Bankia. Questionable accounting methods disguised bank losses. During September 2012, regulators indicated that Spanish banks required €59 billion (US$77 billion) in <b>additional</b> <b>capital</b> to offset losses from real estate investments.|$|E

40|$|While the {{importance}} of venture capital {{to the growth of}} small firms has been widely discussed during the past decade, {{little is known about the}} acquisition of <b>additional</b> equity <b>capital,</b> especially internal equity capital, by the majority of small firms in the U. S. This paper utilizes the information collected in the Federal Reserve Board’s 1993 and 1998 Small Business Finance Surveys to investigate the acquisition of <b>additional</b> equity <b>capital</b> by small firms. While {{the importance}} of public issue markets and venture capital investment in promoting the growth of small dynamic firms cannot be denied, {{the importance of}} external equity capital seems to be overstated. Only a very small number of small firms acquired <b>additional</b> external equity <b>capital.</b> It is the internal equity capital, not external, equity, that is one of the major financing sources for most small firms. We found that younger, lower quality firms were more likely to acquire <b>additional</b> internal equity <b>capital</b> than other firms. There appeared to be a “pecking order” of borrowing from internal sources to traditional lenders to non-traditional lenders. In addition, internal equity capital and debt acquired from traditional and non-traditional lenders appeared to be complementary financial resources. Copyright Springer 2006...|$|R

40|$|This paper evaluates {{evidence}} {{of the impact of}} outbound foreign direct investment (FDI) on domestic investment rates. OECD countries with high rates of outbound FDI in the 1980 s and 1990 s exhibited lower domestic investment than other countries, which suggests that FDI and domestic investment are substitutes. U. S. time series data tell a very different story, however: years in which American multinational firms have greater foreign capital expenditures coincide with greater domestic capital spending by the same firms. One dollar of <b>additional</b> foreign <b>capital</b> spending is associated with 3. 5 dollars of <b>additional</b> domestic <b>capital</b> spending in the time series, implying that foreign and domestic capital are complements in production by multinational firms.
