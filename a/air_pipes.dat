25|$|L13A/B - Created in 1974, this {{locomotive}} {{consisted of}} two 1938 Stock Driving Motor cars coupled back to back. Modifications included the addition of high level <b>air</b> <b>pipes</b> to allow coupling to other Departmental vehicles, reciprocating compressors, {{and the addition of}} power lines between the two cars. These gave the locomotive a very long shoegear span, since all four bogies were fitted with shoe beams, enabling it to cross gaps in the current rail at very low speeds. The locomotive was built so that L14A/B, which had proved the usefulness of a long shunting locomotive, could be scrapped.|$|E
2500|$|Citywide {{compressed}} air energy {{systems have been}} built since 1870. Cities such as Paris, France; Birmingham, England; Dresden, Rixdorf and Offenbach, Germany and Buenos Aires, Argentina installed such systems. Victor Popp constructed the first systems to power clocks by sending a pulse of air every minute to change their pointer arms. They quickly evolved to deliver power to homes and industry. As of 1896, the Paris system had 2.2MW of generation distributed at 550kPa in 50km of <b>air</b> <b>pipes</b> for motors in light and heavy industry. [...] Usage was measured by cubic meters. [...] The systems were {{the main source of}} house-delivered energy in those days and also powered the machines of dentists, seamstresses, printing facilities and bakeries.|$|E
2500|$|Rule {{concluded}} that {{the primary cause of}} the sinking was a failure of the electrical bus that powered the main coolant pumps. According to Rule, SOSUS data indicates that after two minutes of electrical instability, the bus failed at 9:11 a.m., causing the main coolant pumps to trip off. This caused an immediate reactor scram, resulting in a loss of propulsion. Thresher could not be deballasted because ice had formed in the high-pressure <b>air</b> <b>pipes,</b> and so it sank. Rule's analysis holds that flooding (whether from a silver brazed joint or anywhere else) played no role in the reactor scram or the sinking, and that Thresher was intact until it imploded. In addition to the SOSUS data that does not record any sound of flooding, the crew of Skylark did not report hearing any noise that sounded like flooding, and Skylark was able to communicate with Thresher, despite the fact that even a small leak at test depth would have produced a deafening roar. Additionally, the previous commander of Thresher testified that he would not have described flooding, even from a small-diameter pipe, as a [...] "minor problem".|$|E

They preceded him to put the place in order, and before his arrival came to me in some irritation complaining that I had let them a haunted house! They insisted that there were strange noises, as if heavy weights were being dragged about, or heavy footsteps pacing in the rooms and on the stairs. I said that I knew nothing about the matter. The stairs are of stone, water is only carried up to the first floor, there is an unused system of hot <b>air</b> <b>pipes.</b> {177a} Something went wrong with the water-main in the area once, but the noises lasted after it was mended.|$|E
60|$|What {{circumstances}} of blood or food, of early habit or subsequent education, have {{created for the}} latter-day American his present physiognomy? It is as completely marked, as much his own, as is that of any race under the sun that has bred in and in for centuries. But the American owns a more mixed blood than any other race known. The chief stock is English, which is itself so mixed that no man can trace its ramifications. With this are mingled the bloods of Ireland, Holland, France, Sweden, and Germany. All this has been done within but a few years, so that the American {{may be said to}} have no claim to any national type of face. Nevertheless, no man has a type of face so clearly national as the American. He is acknowledged by it all over the continent of Europe, and on his own side of the water is gratified by knowing that he is never mistaken for his English visitor. I think it comes from the hot- <b>air</b> <b>pipes</b> and from dollar worship. In the Jesuit his mode of dealing with things divine has given a peculiar cast of countenance; and why should not the American be similarly moulded by his special aspirations? As to the hot-air pipes, there can, I think, be no doubt that to them is to be charged the murder of all rosy cheeks throughout the States. If the effect was to be noticed simply in the dry faces of the men about Wall Street, I should be very indifferent to the matter. But the young ladies of Fifth Avenue are in the same category. The very pith and marrow of life is baked out of their young bones by the hot-air chambers to which they are accustomed. Hot air is the great destroyer of American beauty.|$|E

50|$|Mt. Tom was {{a leader}} in snow making in the United States. It made snow almost from its start with hand crafted snow {{machines}}.

50|$|The {{electrical}} control system required control cables throughout {{the length of}} the train (in addition to the two <b>air</b> <b>pipes</b> for Westinghouse operation) and a jumper cable was provided at each end of every unit for use when two or more units were coupled to run in multiple. In 1950, no electronic control was possible and the system used four conductors in the cable to achieve graduated braking rates.|$|E
50|$|The short-coupled coaches {{could only}} be {{separated}} in the workshop.

50|$|Silica gel is {{also used}} to dry the air in {{industrial}} compressed air systems. Air from the compressor discharge flows through a bed of silica gel beads. The silica gel adsorbs moisture from the air, preventing damage at the point of use of the compressed air due to condensation or moisture.

50|$|On 8 August 1956, a major mining {{disaster}} {{occurred at}} the Bois du Cazier.
