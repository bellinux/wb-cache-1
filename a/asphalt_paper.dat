A few years ago a new family of highly modified binders was created which was characterized by reversed-phase of polymer-bitumen mixture, and it is now a perfect example of a binder which fulfil the pavement longevity assumptions concept. Based on a new, special polymer which was developed by polymer industry, a new family of binders – Highly Modified Asphalts (HiMA), has been developed – ‘hard’ (EN 25 / 55 - 80, PG 94 - 22), ‘middle’ (EN 45 / 80 - 80, PG 82 - 28) and ‘soft’ (EN 65 / 105 - 80, PG 76 - 28).

Increasing numbers of commercial vehicles and increase axle load that this trend will continue yearly.

40|$|Cold {{recycling}} with emulsified or foamed asphalt {{has been}} widely used in China to convert the existing asphalt surface layer to an asphalt base layer. A new asphalt surface layer between 12 and 18 cm is then paved. Since these semi-rigid pavements were originally built with cement treated base, this reconstruction practice {{has resulted in a}} special pavement structure: cement treated subbase + cold recycled asphalt base + new <b>asphalt</b> surface. This <b>paper</b> reports the long-term performance of such pavement structure on two expressways located in Jiangxi, China. In-situ distress survey and coring were conducted, as well as data collection of traffic and load spectra. Laboratory testing was then carried out on materials collected from the site. Numerical modelling was also conducted to investigate the possible influence from different materials and design options. Results from this study indicated that the main reason of premature failure of this type of pavement structure was the weakening and fatigue of the cold-recycled asphalt base layer. Poor quality control during construction might be the cause since the air voids of the cold-recycled base layer was found to be much higher than the limit. Structural analysis showed that increasing the new asphalt surface layer from 14 cm to 16 cm on top of a 12 cm cold-recycled asphalt base layer could increase the fatigue life and traffic endurance (in terms of equivalent single axle load) 1. 6 - 3. 2 times.

Fresh and impregnated samples of polyester and polypropylene nonwoven geotextiles were tested. Cationic rapid setting emulsified asphalt was used as asphalt binder. Wide-width tensile tests were carried out based on the specification of ABNT - NBR 12824 (1993). Water vapor transmission tests were conducted according to ASTM E 96 M (2005). Results of tensile tests on impregnated geotextiles showed a significant increase on tensile strength values, probably due to the inter contact of the fibers. Results also showed high increase in strength values at strain levels less than 0. 05 % and decrease on stiffness gains with increase of strains. Water vapor transmission tests demonstrated that cationic asphalt emulsion applied on nonwoven geotextiles allows a drastic reduction in permeability values to turn nonwoven geotextiles into a low permeability barrier.
