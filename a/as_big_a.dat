5|$|These two adaptations {{received}} mainly positive reviews, {{with the}} general consensus being that they were cartoonishly enjoyable and gleefully violent homages to their reasons for being. Although Hobo with a Shotgun was not <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>a</b> box office success in the U.S. {{as it was in}} Canada, it has since gained a cult following there.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Allenby's {{plan for}} 13 November {{was to turn}} the right flank of the Ottoman line on the coast despite {{aircraft}} and cavalry reconnaissances revealing a considerable Ottoman force further inland on the Egyptian Expeditionary Force's own right flank. He assigned the task of dealing with this immediate threat to the Australian Mounted Division, which was ordered to make <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>a</b> demonstration of their operations as possible. This would further focus Ottoman {{attention away from the}} coastal sector where the Anzac and Yeomanry Mounted Divisions would advance northwards to attempt to turn the Ottoman right flank assisted by infantry attacks on the Ottoman right centre the following day.|$|E

He {{said that he was}} disappointed that he had to deal with this issue while preparing for such <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>a</b> match as the Champions League semi-final against Chelsea. Bellamy reassured the fans that he was 100% committed to the club. He even stated that Benítez was the manager he had admired most during his career and wishes to emulate Benitez if he ever chooses to pursue a career in football management.|$|E
25|$|Allenby's {{plan for}} 13 November {{was to turn}} the right flank of the Ottoman line on the coast, despite {{aircraft}} and cavalry reconnaissances revealing the large Ottoman force, inland on his right flank facing the Australian Mounted Division.

Here Allenby planned for the Anzac and Yeomanry Mounted Divisions to advance northwards to attempt to turn the Ottoman right flank, assisted by infantry attacks on the Ottoman right centre.|$|E
25|$|The National Courtesy Campaign was not {{actually}} {{the second of}} its kind to instill values of courtesy to Singaporeans, though they were not conducted on <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>a</b> scale as the National Courtesy Campaign over such a long period. More than 10 {{years prior to the}} introduction of the National Courtesy Campaign, there was already a Bus Safety and Courtesy Campaign, which was held in 1968, as well as the National Safety First Council Road Courtesy Campaigns and the Safety and Courtesy Campaign Week which were held between 1972 and 1973 among others.|$|E

25|$|Rams (embolon) were {{fitted to}} the prows of warships, and {{were used to}} rupture the hull of the enemy ship. The {{preferred}} method of attack was to come in from astern, with the aim not of creating a single hole, but of rupturing <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>a</b> length of the enemy vessel as possible. The speed necessary for a successful impact depended on the angle of attack; the greater the angle, the lesser the speed required. At 60 degrees, 4 knots was enough to penetrate the hull, while it increased to 8 knots at 30 degrees. If the target for some reason was in motion {{in the direction of}} the attacker, even less speed was required, and especially if the hit came amidships. The Athenians especially became masters in the art of ramming, using light, un-decked (aphraktai) triremes.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{stated that}} {{songs such as}} [...] "Ready for the Floor" [...] and [...] "Bendable Poseable" [...] were {{reminiscent}} of their previous release, The Warning. The style of the album was not considered <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>a</b> leap forward as the changes evident between Coming on Strong (2004) to The Warning (2006). It was said that Hot Chip had honed their music by using quirks of their musical style to make more accomplished music, however, some critics felt that the album lacked focus, containing too many varied elements; it was described as [...] "loveable but flawed".|$|E
500|$|Kenneth Turan, {{writing in}} Los Angeles Times, gave a {{negative}} review, arguing that Unbreakable had no originality.

[...] "If The Sixth Sense hadn't been <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>a</b> success as it was, this story might have been assigned to oblivion, {{or at least to}} rewrite."

500|$|Through Caldwell more {{officers}} {{joined the}} protest, including two other celebrated aces, Wing Commander Bobby Gibbes and Squadron Leader John Waddy, {{as well as}} Squadron Leader Bert Grace, Squadron Leader Douglas Vanderfield, and later, Squadron Leader Stuart Harpham. During {{a series of meetings}} early in April 1945, Caldwell proposed that the eight resign en masse, and the others agreed. Arthur later stated that, [...] "I meant to make <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>a</b> fuss as I possibly could with the object of getting the position corrected... All the same, we realised that, to lay ourselves open to any charge of mutiny, we might lessen the force of what we were doing, which was the reason we put the things in as resignations and not as any attempt to unseat people higher up." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Breaking Point" [...] premiered on August 18, 2010, on {{the urban}} radio station V-103 in Atlanta. It was {{selected}} as the album's lead single to showcase Hilson sans featured acts. In an interview, Hilson elaborated on the decision: [...] "Timbaland and Polow [...] knew that even though I've been known for club records, guest features and collaborations, I am a true R lover ... for many reasons ... We knew it wouldn't grow as fast or even be <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>a</b> record as some of my past ... We wanted to showcase me by myself, feature-less, and we wanted to reveal that I can sing, and really connect with my music and my message. We felt that was the best introduction to No Boys Allowed." [...] Mosley Music Group and Interscope Records released the single via digital distribution in the United States on September 7, 2010. It was later sent to urban adult contemporary radio on October 25, 2010, while the album's second single, [...] "Pretty Girl Rock", was classified for contemporary hit radio the same week.|$|E
500|$|The video {{ends with}} the camera zooming out of the club to reveal a two-way mirror with Eminem and Dr. Dre in white lab uniforms, observing 50 Cent and taking notes. Atwell stated that [...] "seeing 50 with Dre and Em having his back is <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>a</b> visual {{statement}} {{as it is a}} musical statement" [...] and the shot was significant because it made clear the club was inside the center and not unrelated performance footage. On January 27, 2003, the video debuted on MTV's Total Request Live at number nine and stayed on the chart for fifty days. It also reached number one on the MuchMusic video charts. At the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was awarded Best Rap Video and Best New Artist and was nominated for Video of the Year, Best Male Video, and Viewer's Choice. Cameos include: Dr. Dre, Eminem, D12, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, The Game (in his first cameo appearance), Bang' Em Smurf, Young Buck, Xzibit and DJ Whoo Kid.|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{director}} Chris Weitz {{wanted to}} recast {{the role of}} Jacob Black for Twilights sequel, , due to the major physical changes that occur in Black between the two novels, and have an actor that would accurately portray [...] "the new, larger Jacob Black." [...] Black's role in the novel also increases significantly, with him {{falling in love with}} Bella and becoming a werewolf, putting the actor in a starring role. Representatives for Weitz had stated that they were make a full effort to recast the [...] "high-profile gig," [...] and MTV News confirmed that Weitz was looking at Michael Copon to take on the role; however, Summit Entertainment said a decision had not been made. In an attempt to keep the role, Lautner weight-trained extensively and gained approximately 30 pounds of muscle. In January 2009, Weitz and Summit Entertainment announced that Lautner would continue {{to play the role of}} Jacob in the sequel. In an interview, fellow cast member Kristen Stewart talked about Lautner's transformation saying, [...] "He's an entirely different person physically." [...] Stewart later said, [...] "He gets a lot of attention because he's buff, but I think as soon as the movie comes out, people are going to realize that's not why he got the job." [...] Co-star Robert Pattinson said after seeing Lautner's body, [...] "I saw him and thought 'Jesus, I'm going to get fired." [...] In an interview with The Wrap, Weitz said Lautner deserved a lot of credit for the movie's box office, stating, [...] "If you look at the movie, it should have been the weakest in the franchise, because Robert Pattinson doesn't play <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>a</b> role." [...] Weitz said Lautner had to [...] "pick up that slack, and if his character hadn't been emotionally, not just physically, appealing, the movie wouldn't have been <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>a</b> hit." [...] The commercial performance of the film outpaced the first film, setting several box office records including the biggest midnight opening in the United States and Canada and the biggest single-day opening. The opening weekend of New Moon is the third highest opening weekend in domestic history with $142,839,137. The Twilight Saga: New Moon also has the sixth highest worldwide opening weekend with $274.9 million total. Critical reception was less favorable, with the movie getting a 4.6/10 average from Rotten Tomatoes, and a 44 on Metacritic. Lautner won Favorite Breakout Movie Actor at the 35th People's Choice Awards.|$|E

500|$|In April 1945, having {{recently}} assumed {{command of}} No.1 TAF's No.78 Wing, Arthur helped trigger {{an incident that}} {{became known as the}} [...] "Morotai Mutiny" [...] (a phrase originating in one of his aide memoires at the time). He was one of eight senior pilots, including Australia's top-scoring ace, Group Captain Clive Caldwell, and fellow veterans from the North African campaign, Bobby Gibbes and John Waddy, who attempted to resign their commissions in protest at the relegation of RAAF fighter squadrons to apparently worthless ground attack missions. Frustrated at the lack of attention paid by Headquarters No.1 TAF to a [...] "balance sheet" [...] he produced showing that operational losses outweighed results, Arthur later said that his object for the [...] "mutiny" [...] was to [...] "make <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>a</b> fuss as I possibly could with the object of getting the position corrected." [...] A government inquiry into the incident exonerated the pilots, finding their motives in tendering their resignations to be sincere. Arthur remained in charge of No.78 Wing for the Battle of Tarakan, which commenced on 1May. He handed over command of the wing on 24May, but remained on Tarakan {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
500|$|Kurt's {{choice of}} [...] "I'm the Greatest Star" [...] to {{audition}} {{for the role of}} Tony—the one song not from West Side Story—drew comment: Benigno ascribed it to Kurt's [...] "ability to make a talented ass of himself", while Slezak was of the opinion that Kurt was [...] "way too savvy, and way too hungry for the role" [...] for that kind of misstep. Despite these plot-related issues, both reviewers gave the performance an [...] "A", and Benigno noted both that [...] "he nails it" [...] and [...] "last half of the song is a singing clinic." [...] VanDerWerff was not fond of the reliance on [...] "gimmicky staging", though Futterman called it [...] "an impressive physical performance", Votta stated that [...] "Kurt sounds flawless and the performance is captivating" [...] and Flandez complimented his [...] "captivating high notes after high notes", and added, [...] "He's a star unicorn, and he knows it." [...] Lisa Respers France of CNN wrote that Kurt [...] "was amazing singing Streisand, {{and for the first time}} I realized that he really is <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>a</b> star as Rachel." ...|$|E
500|$|Multiple {{commentators}} have described Inchon {{as the worst}} film ever made, including The Washington Post, [...] Newsweek, TV Guide, and the Canadian Press. Inchon was later profiled in multiple books on worst in film, including The Hollywood Hall of Shame by Harry and Michael Medved, and The Worst Movies of All Time by Michael Sauter. In 2000, Kenneth Lloyd Billingsley, writing in the libertarian magazine Reason, said about a proposed film on Stalinism: [...] "A film like this could easily have turned out <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>a</b> didactic dud as the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's 1982 bomb, Inchon, with Laurence Olivier as Gen. Douglas MacArthur." [...] A 2009 review by Phil Hall for Film Threat was less negative, and he disagreed with the characterization of the film as the worst ever made, [...] "I was genuinely surprised — this is hardly among the very worst films of all time. That's not {{to say it is}} a good film. It is a dull and forgettable movie, and I would never recommend it. However, its reputation for being among the bottom of the cinematic barrel is wholly undeserved." ...|$|E
