60|$|In {{the year}} 1713, lived in Fenchurch-street, one Mr. Coates, a tobacco-merchant, {{who had been}} for many years sorely tormented in his body, and had had {{recourse}} for a cure to all the most eminent physicians of the age, even up to the great Dr. Ratcliff himself; but all this mighty <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>relief</b> was still in vain; each doctor owned him a wonder and a mystery to physic, and left him as much a wonder as they found him. Neither could the professors of surgery guess at his ailment, or resolve the riddle of his distemper; and after having spent, from first to last, above a thousand pounds in search of proper remedies, they found the search ineffectual; the learned all agreed that it could proceed from nothing else than witchcraft; they had now indeed guessed {{the source of his}} illness, but it was an illness of such a kind that, when they had found it out, they thought themselves not the proper persons to prescribe to him any remedies. That task was reserved, it seems, for our Duncan Campbell, who, upon somebody's information or other, was sent for to the bewitched patient Mr. Coates, who found him the wonder that the others had left him, but did wonders in undertaking and compassing his cure. I remember, one of the ingredients made use of was boiling his own water, but I cannot tell how it was used; and, upon turning over the books of some great physicians since, I have found, that they themselves have formerly delivered that as one part of the prescriptions for the cure of patients in like cases. But as there are other things which Mr. Campbell performs, that seem to require a mixture of the second-sight, and of this natural magic, before they can be brought about, I will entertain the reader with one or two passages of that sort likewise, and so conclude the history of this so singular a man's life and adventures.|$|E

50|$|In Auer, {{the claim}} {{is not that the}} {{regulation}} is substantively unlawful, or even that it violates a clear procedural prerequisite, but rather that it was arbitrary and capricious not to conduct amendatory rulemaking (which might have resulted in no change). There was no basis for the court to set aside the agency’s action prior to any <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>relief</b> addressed to the agency itself. The proper procedure for pursuit of Respondent’s grievance was set forth explicitly in the APA: A petition to the agency for rulemaking.|$|E
50|$|If a {{respondent}} has filed an <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>relief</b> or has expressed to the immigration judge {{that he or}} she will be seeking a specific form of relief for which the respondent is not precluded by law, the immigration judge will set a merits hearing date. The merits hearing may be a matter of days or perhaps even more than a year later, {{depending on the type of}} relief requested and the particular court's docket. However, if the only form of relief from removal available or requested is voluntary departure, the immigration judge will most often grant or deny the respondent's request for voluntary departure on the same date of the request.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{attempts}} {{to create a}} reformed poof relief system in Elberfeld began in 1800, when, dissatisfied with existing conditions, the city appointed six visitors to investigate <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>relief.</b> The visitors were increased to 12 the following year.

50|$|The {{plaintiff}} {{wished to}} challenge a {{decision of the}} Refugee Review Tribunal denying him a protection visa. Two sections of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) purported to deny him the right to appeal the decision. The plaintiff applied to the High Court, arguing that the relevant sections did not apply to <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>relief</b> under s75(v) of the Constitution. s474 purported to make certain decisions ("privative clause decisions") unreviewable, while s486A placed time limits on applications to the High Court in respect of these decisions.|$|R
50|$|If a respondent's <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>relief</b> from removal {{is denied}} by an {{immigration}} judge, the respondent may {{be eligible to}} appeal that decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals ("BIA") within 30 days of {{the date of the}} decision. If appealed, the respondent's removal proceedings continue at the appellate level at the BIA. If no appeal is filed and the immigration judge has ordered a respondent to be removed, the order removing the respondent becomes final 30 days after it has been entered by the immigration judge. A respondent with a final order of removal from an immigration judge is susceptible to being arrested and deported from the United States at any time.|$|E

The respondent may also testify in support of his or her <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>relief,</b> and may call witnesses. The Department of Homeland Security also questions the respondent and witnesses, and DHS may also call its own witnesses in some cases. At the conclusion of the merits hearing, the immigration judge issues a decision. This decision might be oral and given on the same day as the merits hearing, or written and served by mail on all parties at a later date.|$|E
50|$|The Pennsylvania state Judicial Conduct Board had {{received}} four complaints about Conahan between 2004 and 2008, but later admitted {{it failed to}} investigate any of them, nor had it sought documentation regarding the cases involved. In 2006, the FBI was tipped off about Conahan and nepotism in the county courts. An additional investigation into improper sentencing in Luzerne County began early in 2007 resulting from requests for help from several youths that were received by the Philadelphia-based Juvenile Law Center. The Center's attorneys determined that several hundred cases had been tried without the teenaged defendants having received adequate assistance of counsel. In April 2008, the Center petitioned the Pennsylvania Supreme Court seeking relief for alleged violation {{of the civil rights}} of those young defendants. The court initially denied the <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>relief,</b> then in January 2009 after charges of corruption against the both judges surfaced, it reconsidered in favor of the appellants.|$|E

At the time of the attacks, Allbaugh was attending a conference in Big Sky, Montana, on the subject of emergency response.

5000|$|Arkansas {{state courts}} may issue a writ of coram nobis for only {{four types of}} claims: {{insanity}} {{at the time of}} trial, a coerced guilty plea, material evidence withheld by the prosecutor, or a third-party confession to the crime during the time between conviction and appeal. The Supreme Court of Arkansas provides the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in Arkansas (Citations and quotes removed): [...] The function of the writ of coram nobis is to secure relief from a judgment rendered while there existed some fact which would have prevented its rendition if it had been known to the trial court and which, through no negligence or fault of the defendant, was not brought forward before rendition of judgment. Coram nobis proceedings are attended by a strong presumption that the judgment of conviction is valid. The court is not required to accept at face value the allegations of the petition.Due diligence is required in making <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>relief,</b> and, {{in the absence of a}} valid excuse for delay, the petition will be denied. The mere naked allegation that a constitutional right has been invaded will not suffice. The application should make a full disclosure of specific facts relied upon and not merely state conclusions as to the nature of such facts.The essence of the writ of coram nobis is that it is addressed to the very court that renders the judgment where injustice is alleged to have been done, rather than to an appellate or other court. The writ is allowed only under compelling circumstances to achieve justice and to address errors of the most fundamental nature. A writ of coram nobis is available to address certain errors of the most fundamental nature that are found in one of four categories::# Insanity at the time of trial, :# A coerced guilty plea, :# Material evidence withheld by the prosecutor, or :# A third-party confession to the crime during the time between conviction and appeal.|$|E

40|$|With the {{collapse}} of high-profile corporations in Australia such as Cobar Mines, National Textiles Ltd and Ansett Airlines, the Howard Coalition Government in Australia (1996 - 2007) in 2000 established the Employee Entitlements Support Scheme (EESS). EESS was later replaced by the General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme (GEERS), funded by taxpayers to provide limited protection for employee entitlements {{in the event of}} corporate insolvency. However, the increased level of insolvencies between 2007 and 2009 due to the economic downturn in Australia, placed greater financial pressure on GEERS to provide protection for employees who had lost their jobs and entitlements. As a consequence, the Rudd Government was required to supplement the reserves of GEERS to cope with <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>relief.</b> In this paper the impact of the financial crisis on the GEERS budget is examined...|$|R
50|$|When Chalmers {{undertook}} {{the management}} of the parish of St John's, the poor of the parish cost the city £1400 per annum, and in four years the pauper expenditure was reduced to £280 per annum. The investigation of new <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>relief</b> was given to the deacon of the district, and an effort was made to enable the poor to help themselves. At this time there were few parishes north of the Forth and Clyde where there was a compulsory assessment for the poor, but the English method of assessment was spreading. Chalmers opposed compulsory assessment as counter-productive, and believed that relief should instead be raised and administered by voluntary means. It has been argued that Chalmers was both a paternalist, on the moral plane, and a supporter of economic individualism.|$|R
5000|$|In English law, an <b>application</b> <b>for</b> {{financial}} <b>relief</b> {{following the}} presentation of a petition for divorce, nullity or judicial separation used to be described as ancillary relief. The term arose because the financial application was 'ancillary' to the petition.
