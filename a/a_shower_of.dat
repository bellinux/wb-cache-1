In a white sari with a golden crown, she performs (surrounded by children) at a Holi celebration. After a series of jump cuts, the video ends with Azalea driving off on a motorcycle under <b>a</b> <b>shower</b> <b>of</b> flower petals.|$|E
5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble assumption {{also provides}} {{an explanation for}} the criticality of the initial ascent phase. Bubbles associated with symptoms are not necessarily generated on site. There is a growth process {{at the beginning of the}} ascent that may last for several cycles until the bubbles have reached a critical size when they are either filtered in the lung or stopped at the tissue level. It is postulated that the production of <b>a</b> <b>shower</b> <b>of</b> small arterial bubbles during the first minutes of the initial ascent is a precursor for DCS symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The popular {{legend of}} the Taktsang monastery is further embellished {{with the story of}} Tenzin Rabgye, who built the temple here in 1692. It has been {{mentioned}} by authors that the 8thcentury guru Padmasmabhava had reincarnated again in the form of Tenzin Rabgye. The corroborative proofs mooted are: that Tenzin Rabgye was seen (by his friends) concurrently inside and outside his cave; even a small quantity of food was adequate to feed all visitors; no one was injured during worship (in spite of the approach track to the monastery being dangerous and slippery); and the people of the Paro valley saw in the sky various animal forms and religious symbols including <b>a</b> <b>shower</b> <b>of</b> flowers that appeared and also vanished in the air without touching the earth.|$|E

5|$|Although Project Alberta had no attack orders, it {{proceeded}} {{with the plan}} to have the Little Boy ready by 1 August 1945 and the first Fat Man ready for use {{as soon as possible}} after that. In the meantime, a series of twelve combat missions were flown between 20 and 29 July against targets in Japan using high-explosive Pumpkin bombs. Project Alberta's Sheldon Dike and Milo Bolstead flew on some of these missions, as did the British observer Group Captain Leonard Cheshire. One serious incident occurred when a Pumpkin bomb was released in the bomb bay of the B-29 Strange Cargo while it was taxiing. The bomb fell through the closed bomb bay doors onto the taxiway. The plane came to a halt in <b>a</b> <b>shower</b> <b>of</b> sparks, but fire fighters doused the plane and the bomb in foam, and the bomb did not explode. The aircraft had to be jacked up to remove the bomb.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with these}} constraints, the Spanish {{expedition}} {{had to cross}} the river several times and fight at each ford against stiff opposition. The bulk of the Inca army confronted the Spaniards from a set of terraces overlooking a plain by the Urubamba River. Several Spanish assaults against the terraces failed against <b>a</b> <b>shower</b> <b>of</b> arrows, slingshots and boulders {{coming down from the}} terraces as well as from both flanks. To hinder the efforts of the Spanish cavalry the Incas flooded the plain using previously prepared channels; water eventually reached the horses' girths. The defenders then counterattacked; some of them used Spanish weapons captured in previous encounters such as swords, bucklers, armor and even a horse, ridden by Manco Inca himself. In a severely compromised situation, Hernando Pizarro ordered a retreat; under the cover of darkness the Spanish force fled through the Urubamba valley with the Incas in pursuit and reached Cusco the next day.|$|E
5|$|George's mother, the Electress Sophia, died on 28 May 1714 {{at the age}} of 83. She had {{collapsed}} in the gardens at Herrenhausen after rushing to shelter from <b>a</b> <b>shower</b> <b>of</b> rain. George was now Queen Anne's direct heir. He swiftly revised the membership of the Regency Council that would take power after Anne's death, as it was known that Anne's health was failing and politicians in Britain were jostling for power. She suffered a stroke, which left her unable to speak, and died on 1 August 1714. The list of regents was opened, the members sworn in, and George was proclaimed King of Great Britain and Ireland. Partly due to contrary winds, which kept him in The Hague awaiting passage, he did not arrive in Britain until 18 September. George was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 20 October. His coronation was accompanied by rioting in over twenty towns in England.|$|E

Behind this is the Scene, which represents a thick Cloudy Sky, a very Rocky Coast, and a Tempestuous Sea in perpetual Agitation. This Tempest (suppos'd to be rais'd by Magick) has many dreadful Objects in it, as several Spirits in horrid shapes flying down amongst the Sailers, then rising and crossing in the Air.

5|$|The climatic vault heist {{required}} {{four weeks}} of preparation with every scene and camera angle determined in advance. The filmmakers hired stunt director Spiro Razatos and stunt coordinator Jack Gill to direct the second-unit action filming. The pair initially began research for the stunt by testing {{the capabilities of the}} prop vaults and the Dodge Chargers driven by Diesel and Walker. Filmed on the streets of Hato Rey, the chaotic scene demanded specific timing that had to be synchronized with the various character interactions also occurring during the scene. Razatos chose to use a series of camera cars including a crane-mounted camera atop a Porsche Cayenne, which allowed him to film from a variety of angles and heights while the vehicles were in motion, and a Subaru Impreza with a steel cage built around it that allowed for tracking shots. The Subaru's driver Allen Padelford would occasionally accidentally collide with the vault, creating <b>a</b> <b>shower</b> <b>of</b> sparks that inadvertently became useful footage. Padelford also developed a top-mount dual-drive system for the Chargers that allowed a stunt driver to control the vehicle from the roof, while the actor focused on their performance inside the car.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears at a vanity, putting Curious on and {{earrings}} by Bulgari. She is then seen holding a top hat {{in front of}} her face, while doves fly out of another hat. Spears starts singing in the vanity but stands up and puts on a ringmaster jacket. She walks through an aisle while dancing suggestively with several circus dancers. Throughout the video, there are interspersed scenes of different circus performers, including ribbon dancers, contortionists, clowns and a mime on stilts. There are also scenes of Spears singing with the top hat, wearing a nude body stocking in front of a red curtain, with a spotlight on her. This is followed by a group dance scene {{in the middle of a}} circus ring, where Spears wears the ringmaster jacket, sequined hot pants and a feathered top hat. In the second verse, she dances with a chair and a whip wearing a nude bra covered in leaves. The video continues with a series of intercut scenes, such as Spears in slow motion in front of <b>a</b> <b>shower</b> <b>of</b> sparks, her surrounded by a pair of lions and in front of an elephant. During the bridge, Spears and her dancers perform a routine in front of flames. In the last chorus, Spears returns to the circus ring, surrounded by two elephants, many more circus performers, dancers and fire breathers. The video ends with Spears in the spotlight, laughing with the top hat over her head.|$|E

25|$|Ignition {{is started}} by a very-short (~10picoseconds) ultra-high-power (~70kJ, 4PW) laser pulse, aimed {{through a hole}} in the plasma at the core.

The electrons heat a spot on one side of the dense core, and if this heating is localised enough it is expected to drive the area well beyond ignition energies.|$|E
