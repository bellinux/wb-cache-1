25|$|The {{aftermath}} of <b>a</b> <b>Jigsaw</b> game is discovered by a SWAT team. The victim, Troy, {{was meant to}} rip chains from his body in order to escape from a bomb. Lieutenant Daniel Rigg calls Detectives Mark Hoffman and Allison Kerry to the scene. Kerry, who is guilt-ridden over the disappearance of Eric, {{points out that the}} room's only exit was welded shut, breaking Jigsaw's modus operandi of giving his victims a chance to survive. That night, while reviewing the videotape, she is abducted and awakens in a harness that is hooked into her ribs. Kerry manages to retrieve the key from a suspended beaker of acid and unlock it before the timer expires, but it tears her rib cage apart anyway, killing her.|$|E

25|$|Shepherd {{was convicted}} of the crime on October 9, 2008, after jurors deliberated for four hours. He was given the maximum {{sentence}} of 99 {{years in prison and}} a $10,000 fine. During the punishment phase of the trial, Shepherd revealed how he murdered Stewart. He pressured her to reveal her new relationship at college, but she refused to answer and grabbed a knife from a table and approached him with it in her hand. She swung at him with the knife and nicked his fingers. Afraid she was going to stab him again, he grabbed her around the neck with one arm and tried to reach the knife with his other hand. He ended up choking her to death out of anger.

500|$|Burke {{has been}} a {{principal}} draftsman of the map of ward boundaries. When Burke started his political career, the 14th Ward that he represents was centered in the Back of the Yards neighborhood, {{more than a mile}} and a half east of where it is now. The 14th Ward is a gerrymandered area whose shape has been described as [...] "like a piece of <b>a</b> <b>jigsaw</b> puzzle". With each new ward map, drawn every 10 years, its boundaries have been moved farther west. As of 2010, its boundaries extended from 39th Street south to 59th and from Western Avenue west to Cicero Avenue, including most of the Brighton Park, Gage Park and Archer Heights neighborhoods. The ethnic composition of the ward has changed dramatically during Burke's tenure in office. As of 1968, residents were predominantly of Polish or other Eastern European extraction, but by 2010 it had a large Mexican and Mexican-American population.|$|E

500|$|Verlaine and Lloyd interplayed their guitars {{around the}} rhythm section's drum hits and basslines. Their dual playing drew on 1960s rock and avant-garde jazz styles, abandoning the layered power chords of {{contemporary}} punk rock {{in favor of}} melodic lines and counter-melodies. Verlaine established the song's rhythmic phrase, against which Lloyd played dissonant melodies. Lloyd had learned to notate his solos {{by the time they}} recorded Marquee Moon, allowing him to develop his solo for a song from introduction to variation and resolution. The two traded rhythmic and melodic lines several times on some songs while producing tension. [...] "There weren't many bands where the two guitars played rhythm and melody back and forth, like <b>a</b> <b>jigsaw</b> puzzle", Lloyd said. Most of the solos on Marquee Moon followed a pattern wherein Verlaine ran up a major scale but regressed slightly after each step. On [...] "See No Evil", he soloed through a full octave before playing a blues-influenced riff, and on the title track, he played in a Mixolydian mode and lowered the seventh by half a step. Lloyd opened [...] "Friction" [...] by playing octaves before Verlaine's ringing harmonics and series of descending scales.|$|E
500|$|Once back in London, {{and with}} his {{compositions}} continually overlooked for inclusion on releases by the Beatles, Harrison found creative fulfilment in extracurricular projects that, {{in the words of}} his musical biographer, Simon Leng, served as an [...] "emancipating force" [...] from the restrictions imposed on him in the band. His activities during 1969 included producing Apple signings Billy Preston and Doris Troy, two American singer-songwriters whose soul and gospel roots proved as influential on All Things Must Pass as the music of the Band. He also recorded with artists such as Leon Russell and Jack Bruce, and accompanied Clapton on a short tour with Delaney Bramlett's soul revue, Delaney & Bonnie and Friends. In addition, Harrison identified his involvement with the Hare Krishna movement as providing [...] "another piece of <b>a</b> <b>jigsaw</b> puzzle" [...] that represented the spiritual journey he had begun in 1966. As well as embracing the Vaishnavist branch of Hinduism, Harrison produced two hit singles during 1969–70 by the UK-based devotees, credited as Radha Krishna Temple (London). In January 1970, Harrison invited American producer Phil Spector to participate in the recording of Lennon's Plastic Ono Band single [...] "Instant Karma!" [...] This association led to Spector being given the task of salvaging the Beatles' Get Back rehearsal tapes, released officially as the Let It Be album (1970), and later co-producing All Things Must Pass.|$|E
500|$|... "The Chinese Restaurant" [...] {{was first}} read by its cast on December 5, 1990, {{and it was}} filmed on December 11. Filming took place at CBS Studio Center in Studio City, Los Angeles, California, where all filming for the second season took place. As only one {{location}} was used, it took roughly half {{of the time it}} usually took for an episode to be filmed. Cast members have remarked that the filming was shorter than on any other episode. A few changes were made; in the first draft of the script, George, Jerry, and Elaine entered the restaurant talking about their least favorite holiday. In the version that aired, they talk about combining the jobs of policemen and garbagemen into a single job. In the original draft, the three friends also discussed how to spend the long waiting period in the future, with George suggesting they bring a deck of cards and that Jerry bring <b>a</b> <b>jigsaw</b> puzzle with nothing but penguins. One scene was cut before broadcast, featuring George explaining to Jerry that he pulled his hamstring while trying to untuck the covers of a hotel bed during his recent stay in Boston. George can be seen grabbing his hamstring as he walks to the phone. The scene was later included on the Seinfeld seasons one and two DVD boxset.|$|E

500|$|Consequently, paleontologists must usually rely on {{stratigraphy}} to date fossils. Stratigraphy is {{the science}} of deciphering the [...] "layer-cake" [...] that is the sedimentary record, and {{has been compared to}} <b>a</b> <b>jigsaw</b> puzzle. Rocks normally form relatively horizontal layers, with each layer younger than the one underneath it. If a fossil is found between two layers whose ages are known, the fossil's age must lie between the two known ages. Because rock sequences are not continuous, but may be broken up by faults or periods of erosion, {{it is very difficult to}} match up rock beds that are not directly next to one another. However, fossils of species that survived for a relatively short time can be used to link up isolated rocks: this technique is called biostratigraphy. For instance, the conodont [...] Eoplacognathus pseudoplanus has a short range in the Middle Ordovician period. If rocks of unknown age are found to have traces of [...] E. pseudoplanus, they must have a mid-Ordovician age. Such index fossils must be distinctive, be globally distributed and have a short time range to be useful. However, misleading results are produced if the index fossils turn out to have longer fossil ranges than first thought. Stratigraphy and biostratigraphy can in general provide only relative dating (A was before B), which is often sufficient for studying evolution. However, this is difficult for some time periods, because of the problems involved in matching up rocks of the same age across different continents.|$|E
500|$|The {{main goal}} of each level is to {{navigate}} through {{the stage and}} reach the gong located {{at the end of}} the level in order to transport Croc to the next, while also saving as many captured Gobbos imprisoned throughout the stage as possible. Certain stages also contain boss enemies known as [...] "Guardians" [...] that Croc must defeat in order to progress to the next stage. Various different collectibles are scattered throughout stages, including small, gray crystal orbs that act as Croc's health, and red hearts that give the player an extra life when collected. Also hidden across each stage are 6 Gobbos being held captive by the Dantini tribe that act as Croc's main objective throughout the length of the game. 5 of these Gobbos are hidden in various locations throughout the level, often collected by solving a puzzle or completing a challenge, whilst the 6th Gobbo is located in a bonus room hidden behind a set of doors that can only be reached by collecting 5 colored crystals hidden throughout the level. Rescuing every Gobbo before a boss level in each world unlocks a secret level that can be completed in order to collect <b>a</b> <b>jigsaw</b> puzzle piece. Subsequently, collecting every puzzle piece in the game unlocks an extra island containing more levels for the player to progress through. While collecting the Gobbos is not mandatory to completing the game, doing so is nonetheless necessary in order to face against the game's final boss and unlock the game's true ending.|$|E
