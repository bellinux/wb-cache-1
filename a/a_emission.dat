50|$|A {{semiconductor}} {{can absorb}} photons with energy larger {{than or equal}} to its bandgap. This means that light with a shorter wavelength is absorbed. Semiconductors are typically efficient emitters if the minimum of the conduction band energy is at the same position in k-space as the maximum of the valence band, i.e., the band gap is direct. The band gap of bulk TMDC material down to a thickness of two monolayers is still indirect, so the emission efficiency is lower compared to monolayered materials. The emission efficiency is about 104 greater for TMDC monolayer than for bulk material. The band gaps of TMDC monolayers are in the visible range (between 400 nm and 700 nm). The direct emission shows two transitions called A and B, separated by the spin-orbit coupling energy. The lowest energy and therefore most important in intensity is the <b>A</b> <b>emission.</b> Owing to their direct band gap, TMDC monolayers are promising materials for optoelectronics applications.|$|E

The observations {{were carried out}} using a high-resolution (lambda/Delta lambda approx. 40, 000) Fabry-Perot/CCD spectrometer at the McMath-Pierce solar telescope on Kitt Peak. This forbidden line, the carbon analog of [O I] 6300 A, is emitted in the radiative decay of C(1 D) atoms. In the absence of other sources and sinks, [C I] 9850 <b>A</b> <b>emission</b> {{may be used as}} a direct tracer of CO photodissociation in comets. However, in Hale-Bopp's large, dense coma, other processes, such as collisional excitation of ground-state C(3 P), dissociative recombination of CO+, and collisional dissociation of CO and CO 2 may produce significant amounts of C(1 D). The long C(1 D) radiative lifetime (approx. 4000 s) makes collisional de-excitation (quenching) the primary loss mechanism in the inner coma. Thus, a detailed, self-consistent global model of collisional and photochemical interactions is necessary to fully account for [C I] 9850 <b>A</b> <b>emission</b> in comet Hale-Bopp...|$|E

The [Oiii]λ 5007 Å line and 5 -GHz radio properties are compared and studied on a large, representative sample of GPS and CSS (i. e., young) quasars and radio galaxies as well as large-scale sources using [Oiii]λ 5007 Å line and 5 -GHz radio data from literature and our observations.

The main {{result is that the}} [Oiii]λ 5007 <b>Å</b> <b>emission</b> is strongly related to the GPS/CSS source size indicating that the [Oiii]λ 5007 <b>Å</b> <b>emission</b> is clearly enhanced by the jet expansion through the host galaxy ISM.

The goals of this work are to positively identify the 8446 <b>A</b> <b>emission</b> in the twilight airglow and to determine the intensity decay {{as a function of}} solar depression angle. Also, a study of the relative triplet line strengths is performed in hopes of establishing the importance of the primary excitation mechanisms (photoelectron impact or Bowen fluorescence) during the twilight period. Although absent in most of the data, a distinct auroral influence is also found to contribute considerably, on occasion, to the emission over Millstone Hill. The ratio of the combined 8446. 26 A and 8446. 38 A intensities to the 8446. 76 A intensity varies as 0. 13 +/- 0. 03 per degree of solar depression angle, indicating that secondary excitation mechanisms are becoming increasingly important as evening twilight progresses. Bowen fluorescence is not found to be the primary excitation mechanism at any time during twilight, contributing just a few Rayleighs at most.

The long-term average intensity shows a clear dependence on lambda(sub III), which establishes conclusively that the emission is produced by the interaction between Io's atmosphere and the plasma torus. Two prominent average intensity maxima, 70 deg to 90 deg wide, are centered at lambda(sub III) about 130 deg. and about 295 deg. A comparison of data from October 1998 with a three-dimensional plasma torus model, based upon electron impact excitation of atomic oxygen, suggests a basis for study of the torus interaction with Io's atmosphere. The observed short-term, erratic [O I] 6300 A intensity variations fluctuate approximately 20 % to 50 % on time scale of tens of minutes with less frequent fluctuations of a factor of about 2. The most likely candidate to produce these fluctuations is a time-variable energy flux of field-aligned nonthermal electrons identified recently in Galileo PLS data. If true, the short-term [O I] intensity fluctuations {{may be related to}} variable field-aligned currents driven by inward and outward torus plasma transport and/or transient high-latitude, field-aligned potential drops. A correlation between the intensity and emission line width indicates molecular dissociation may contribute significantly to the [O I] 6300 <b>A</b> <b>emission.</b> The nonthermal electron energy flux may produce O(1 -D) by electron impact dissociation of SO 2 and SO, with the excess energy going into excitation of O and its kinetic energy.
