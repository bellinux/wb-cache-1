5|$|Drew Karpyshyn, who {{previously}} served as <b>a</b> <b>senior</b> <b>writer</b> for Knights of the Old Republic, {{was the lead}} writer for Mass Effect. Despite {{of the fact that}} each of the game's planets had one primary writer, all of the writers involved in the production had to review each other's work and offer criticism. This process of collaborative feedback and individual effort is common at BioWare, and it behoved Karpyshyn to make sure the style was consistent across all different areas. One of the biggest challenges the writers faced was the amount of volume they were required to write to support the game's multiple dialogue paths and story outcomes. It took them three years to get everything into the game, which featured about 400,000 words and more than 20,000 lines of spoken dialogue. According to Karpyshyn, this is roughly the equivalent of 20 movies or 4-5 full novels.|$|E

500|$|... "Local Ad" [...] {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics. [...] Travis Fickett of IGN gave the episode a favorable review, saying [...] "This episode {{is a prime}} example of how The Office is able to do broad comedy while at the same time treating its characters as real people." [...] Fickett went on to praise the acting of Rainn Wilson as a depressed Dwight, as well as the story's twist. [...] Fickett stated that [...] "A great twist here is that we think we're watching Michael pilot a sinking ship as usual, but in fact – the ad is quite good. There's some clever stuff in there, albeit some of it not exactly professional in its production, but Michael doesn't do such a bad job." [...] Like Fickett, Christine Fenno of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a favorable review. [...] Fenno said that [...] "The premise of this episode, 'Local Ad' — the Scranton staffers shoot a commercial — was strong, and allowed almost every ensemble member to shine." [...] Fenno also praised the acting work of Ed Helms as Andy, as well as Steve Carell as Michael. [...] Oscar Dahl, <b>a</b> <b>Senior</b> <b>Writer</b> for BuddyTV, praised the episode, but also felt that the episode's thirty-minute length created a stark contrast to the previous four episodes' hour-long run, saying [...] "tonight's episode felt short. [...] Really short." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Survivor Man" [...] {{received}} a 4.9/7 in the Nielsen ratings, meaning that 4.9 {{percent of households}} were tuned in {{at any given moment}} and seven percent of all televisions in use were tuned in to the program. The episode was watched by 8.29 million viewers and achieved a 4.3/10 in the ages 18–49 demographic. Travis Fickett of IGN stated that [...] "Overall, this isn't a terrific episode, but holds up the show's usual standard. Steve Carell is hilarious as usual. Watching him attempt to make shelter and clothing out of his suit over the span of only a few hours is great fun." [...] Fickett also stated that {{a good portion of the}} humor in the episode came from in-jokes that required previous knowledge of the series, specifically pointing out the parallel comparison between Michael and Jim's lives. [...] Like Fickett, Christine Fenno of Entertainment Weekly praised the episode's comparison between Michael and Jim. [...] Fenno also went on to praise other points of the episode, stating she also enjoyed the overall episode for its [...] "just outdoorsiness with Michael and Dwight, and infighting among the rest of the staff." [...] Oscar Dahl, <b>a</b> <b>Senior</b> <b>Writer</b> for BuddyTV, stated that [...] "What seems like a one and done episode without much character work at first turns into much more by the end." [...] Dahl went on to praise the episode, stating that it was [...] "lighter" [...] in comparison to Carell's previous episode [...] "Casino Night".|$|E
2500|$|Being the showrunner—or leading {{executive}} producer, Polly Draper led {{the writers}} {{room and the}} series' production. She also served as head writer (another task of the executive producer) by writing most prolifically, editing scripts, and conveying storyline ideas for each episode.

[...] The Constitution Party, a paleoconservative third party, also campaigned for release of Obama's original long-form certificate. [...] In December 2008, Alex Koppelman, <b>a</b> <b>senior</b> <b>writer</b> for Salon, characterized nearly all of the prominent people promoting the story Obama was not eligible to be president—including Jerome Corsi, Philip Berg, Andy Martin, and Robert Schultz—as having a [...] "history of conspiracist thought".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 2006 Eichenwald left The New York Times and joined the staff of newly created {{business}} magazine Condé Nast Portfolio as <b>a</b> <b>senior</b> <b>writer.</b> [...] He was recruited by Jim Impoco, a former New York Times editor and {{managing editor of the}} new Portfolio. The first edition of the magazine was published in April 2007. However, both Eichenwald and Impoco had a very short tenure at Portfolio. [...] An Eichenwald article about terrorism that had been championed by Impoco was killed by editor-in-chief Joanne Lipman, leading to a significant dispute between the two editors. After several months of tension between them, Lipman fired Impoco in August 2007; Eichenwald resigned on the same day. Portfolio was not a commercial success, and was closed in April 2009. The failure of such a high-profile project was seen as a major setback for Condé Nast.|$|E

[...] Howard Richman wrote in the December 2012 issue of the Golf Course Management (GCM) Magazine that [...] "Nearly 40 years ago — before Hurdzan emerged among the world’s most notable and decorated golf course architects — he traveled the globe to protect America's interests. As a commander for the U.S. Army Special Forces, {{also known as the}} Green Berets, Hurdzan prepared his unit in case it needed to be called to action in theaters of war or conflict, such as Vietnam. Part of their war games training included missions in places such as Germany". Richman also wrote that an architecture editor for Golf Digest, [...] " [...] Whitten is convinced that Hurdzan, who chose not to pursue the rank of general, earned his stripes. Twice Hurdzan's orders to join the fighting in Vietnam were canceled (he was supposed to go there to spray jungles after he was schooled in chemical, biological and radiological warfare). Not seeing combat left him unfulfilled. [...] "I wanted to be a real live warrior, a cutter and a shooter, not some technical geek," [...] Hurdzan says. If he had fought for his country, Whitten imagines Hurdzan would have been outstanding." [...] Richman concluded that, [...] "convinced he has lived a charmed life, [...] thankful now that Vietnam wasn't in the cards for him so long ago." ...|$|E
