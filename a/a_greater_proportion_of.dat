5|$|The {{peppered}} maskray {{prefers to}} pick prey {{from the surface}} of the substrate, as opposed to digging for them. Caridean shrimp are by far the most important food source. It also consumes polychaete worms and amphipods, and rarely penaeid prawns, molluscs, and small bony fishes. Compared to smaller rays, larger rays have a more varied diet that incorporates <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> polychaete worms.|$|E

Spitfire units, however, had a lower attrition rate and a higher victory-to-loss ratio than those flying Hurricanes because of its higher performance. During the Battle, Spitfires in general were tasked with engaging Luftwaffe fightersmainly Messerschmitt Bf 109E series aircraft which were a close match for them.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to lead {{can occur}} by {{contaminated}} air, water, dust, food, or consumer products. Children are {{at greater risk}} as {{they are more likely to}} put objects in their mouth such as those that contain lead paint and absorb <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> the lead that they eat. Exposure at work is a common cause of lead poisoning in adults with certain occupations at particular risk. Diagnosis is typically by measurement of the blood lead level. The Centers for Disease Control (US) has set the upper limit for blood lead for adults at 10µg/dl (10µg/100 g) and for children at 5µg/dl. Elevated lead may also be detected by changes in red blood cells or dense lines in the bones of children as seen on X-ray.|$|E

5|$|Multi-platform {{releases}} {{were common}} {{in the early days}} of RPGs, but there was a period during the 1990s when this was not generally the case. The sixth generation of home gaming consoles led many game developers to resume the practice, and some opted to develop primarily or exclusively for consoles. The combination of the Xbox and DirectX technologies proved especially popular due to the two systems' architectural similarities, as well as their common set of programming tools.

In return, Hammer's distribution arm, Exclusive Films, distributed Lippert's films in the United Kingdom. Lippert's company was, in fact, a front for 20th Century Fox, whose president, Spyros Skouras, {{was a close friend}} of Lippert's. Quota laws in the UK meant that US films had to have a British supporting feature, so it was in the American studios' interests to fund these features to recover <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> the box office receipts.|$|E
5|$|The least weasel feeds {{predominantly}} on mouse-like rodents, including mice, hamsters, gerbils and others. It {{usually does}} not attack adult hamsters and rats. Frogs, fish, small birds and bird eggs are rarely eaten. It {{can deal with}} adult pikas and gerbils, but usually cannot overcome brown rats and sousliks. Exceptional cases are known of least weasels killing prey far larger than themselves, such as capercaillie, hazel hen and hares. In England, a favoured prey item is the field vole (Microtus agrestis). These have fluctuations in population size, and in years of abundance may form up to 54% of the weasel's diet. In years of scarcity, birds form <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> the diet and female least weasels may fail to breed.|$|E

In January 1899, artist William Keith and poet Charles Keeler obtained for her a part-time position as librarian of the Bohemian Club, of which Keith and Keeler were members. Her first assignment was to edit Songs from Bohemia, a book of poems by Daniel O'Connell, Bohemian Club co-founder and journalist, following his death. Her salary was $50 each month, less than she had been earning in Oakland, but her duties were light enough {{that she was able}} to devote <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> her time to writing, and she signed on as sometime staff of Charles Fletcher Lummis's The Land of Sunshine magazine.

5|$|Grey reef sharks feed {{mainly on}} bony fishes, with {{cephalopods}} such as squid and octopus being the second-most important food group, and crustaceans such as crabs and lobsters {{making up the}} remainder. The larger sharks take <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> cephalopods. These sharks hunt individually or in groups, and {{have been known to}} pin schools of fish against the outer walls of coral reefs for feeding. They excel at capturing fish swimming in the open, and they complement hunting whitetip reef sharks, which are more adept at capturing fish inside caves and crevices. Their sense of smell is extremely acute, being capable of detecting one part tuna extract in 10 billion parts of sea water. In the presence of a large quantity of food, grey reef sharks may be roused into a feeding frenzy; in one documented frenzy caused by an underwater explosion that killed several snappers, one of the sharks involved was attacked and consumed by the others.|$|E
5|$|Normal {{dietary fat}} {{contains}} mostly long-chain triglycerides (LCT). Medium-chain triglycerides are more ketogenic than LCTs because they generate more ketones {{per unit of}} energy when metabolised. Their use allows for a diet with a lower proportion of fat and <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> protein and carbohydrate, leading to more food choices and larger portion sizes. The original MCT diet developed by Peter Huttenlocher in the 1970s derived 60% of its calories from MCT oil. Consuming that quantity of MCT oil caused abdominal cramps, diarrhoea and vomiting in some children. A figure of 45% {{is regarded as a}} balance between achieving good ketosis and minimising gastrointestinal complaints. The classical and modified MCT ketogenic diets are equally effective and differences in tolerability are not statistically significant. The MCT diet is less popular in the United States; MCT oil is more expensive than other dietary fats and is not covered by insurance companies.|$|E

5|$|Reid {{occupied}} high-ranking cabinet {{positions in}} Greenfield's government {{and that of}} his successor, John Edward Brownlee. Greenfield appointed him Minister of Health and Minister of Municipal Affairs in 1921. In the former capacity, he drew on his past experience with the Vermilion board in establishing new municipal health boards. He also proposed a program of eugenics through the sterilisation of the mentally handicapped, which in 1928 led to the Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta. As an advocate of government-wide economy, he laid off all school inspection nurses and many public health nurses. This inclination towards thrift was also evident in his performance as Minister of Municipal Affairs, in which he resisted a 1926 call from several municipalities to transfer <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> the responsibility for caring for indigents to the province. In 1929, he disagreed with them again when he insisted that they be responsible for 10% of the old age pensions paid to their residents.|$|E
