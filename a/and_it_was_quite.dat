5|$|Mu'azzam's {{imprisonment}} was not severe, {{and indeed}} he {{was kept in}} the lap of luxury by his captors. This was the custom with regard to high-born and potentially useful captives, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> normal for captive and captor to become friends and even allies. Shivaji's own son, Sambhaji, was at roughly the same time a prisoner of the Mughals.|$|E
5|$|The {{roads were}} just prairie trails which wound around bluffs, {{up and down}} hills. These roads were quite {{adequate}} for horses, but were a different story for cars; {{very few of the}} roads went on the square where the roads allowances were finally surveyed. When it rained there was always a mud puddle at the bottom of every hill and every car that went through made the ruts deeper and deeper until you were stuck. The coming of cars soon made a big difference. The prairie trails proved inadequate and road allowances were graded and built up; culverts had to be installed where the natural water runs were. The new graded roads were a big improvement but many a muddy mile was driven over the country roads. Gradually, some of the main highways would get some gravel <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> a pleasure to pull of a muddy country road on to a few miles of gravel—Les Moffatt.|$|E
500|$|At the Liverpool concert {{where he}} was offered the {{production}} job, Nelson had noted that Coldplay's performance was [...] "very very uptight [...] they rushed through the set <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> difficult to listen to". Once in the studio Nelson and the band went through each song, learning {{how to play the}} piece live and deciding what tempo to play it at in an attempt to get the group to [...] "calm down" [...] ("Trouble", for example, had to be reworked to eliminate the cacophony included in its early versions).|$|E

500|$|Reactions to the {{transmissions}} were mixed, {{triggering a}} media debate concerning the ethical implications of mixing rock entertainment with human tragedy. The Edge said, [...] "A lot of nights {{it felt like}} quite an abrupt interruption that was probably not particularly welcomed {{by a lot of}} people in the audience. You were grabbed out of a rock concert and given a really strong dose of reality <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> hard sometimes to get back to something as frivolous as a show having watched five or ten minutes of real human suffering." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. In 2002, he said, [...] "I can't remember anything more excruciating than those Sarajevo link-ups. It was like throwing a bucket of cold water over everybody. You could see your audience going, 'What the fuck are these guys doing?' But I'm proud to have been a part of a group who were trying to do something." [...] During a transmission for the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo told Bono via satellite, [...] "We know you're not going to do anything for us. You're going to go back to a rock show. You're going to forget that we even exist. And we're all going to die." [...] Some people close to the band joined the War Child charity project, including Brian Eno. Writer Bill Flanagan believes that the link-ups accomplished Bono's goal for Zoo TV of [...] "illustrating onstage the obscenity of idly flipping from a war on CNN to rock videos on MTV". U2 vowed to perform in Sarajevo someday, eventually fulfilling this commitment on their 1997 PopMart Tour.|$|E
500|$|... "Acrobat" [...] {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{personal}} songs on Achtung Baby with Bono acknowledging personal weakness, contradictions, and inadequacy. The Edge noted that the song contained [...] "a bit of venom", likening it to [...] "the bitter, John Lennon tradition of 'Working Class Hero', slightly snarling and cynical." [...] Bono stated [...] "as we moved from the eighties to the nineties, I stopped throwing rocks at the obvious symbols of power and the abuse of it. I started throwing rocks at my own hypocrisy... 'Acrobat' [...] 'Don't believe what you hear, don't believe what you see / If you just close your eyes / You can feel the enemy...' I can't remember it, but the point is: you start to see the world in a different way, and you're part of the problem, not just part of the solution". In 2006, he noted it was [...] "a song about being a hypocrite, and I think we all can be and I certainly have been. And you know, you exact very high standards on people in the world but then you don't live them personally", noting the theme was most evident in the lyric [...] "I must be an acrobat to talk like this and act like that". Hot Press editor Niall Stokes felt The Edge's guitar playing combined elements of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] with [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky". Speaking of its theme he said [...] "at its heart is an awareness of the ravages of time, and what it does to people and to relationships. But beyond that, there is the self-awareness that, itself, comes only with experience... Bono acknowledges his own weakness and inadequacy. He is more conscious now than ever before of the contradictions in his own position." [...] Andy Greene of Rolling Stone believed the [...] "aggressive and venomous" [...] song reflected Bono's thoughts during the album sessions, saying [...] "Nearly every lyric brims with rage... It was a new decade <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> possible they were about to be dismissed as a relic of the past." ...|$|E

We saw Tricky {{a couple of weeks ago}} in Paris <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> an amicable meeting after five or six years." [...] Tricky agreed to record with the band and he revealed in a June 2013 interview that [...] "there's a couple of songs which are OK, which are really good actually to be honest with you". However, Tricky also stated in June 2013 that he could not spend more than two or three days with Massive Attack and described band member DaddyG as [...] "very arrogant".|$|E
2500|$|On 20 November 1968, {{two days}} before the release of The Beatles, McCartney gave Radio Luxembourg an {{exclusive}} interview, in which he commented on several of the album's songs. Speaking of [...] "Helter Skelter", he said: [...] "Umm, that came about just 'cause I'd read a review of a record which said, 'and this group really got us wild, there's echo on everything, they're screaming their heads off.' And I just remember thinking, 'Oh, it'd be great to do one. Pity they've done it. Must be great – really screaming record.' And then I heard their record <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> straight, and it was very sort of sophisticated. It wasn't rough and screaming and tape echo at all. So I thought, 'Oh well, we'll do one like that, then.' And I had this song called 'Helter Skelter,' which is just a ridiculous song. So we did it like that, 'cuz I like noise." ...|$|E
