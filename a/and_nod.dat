5|$|Following {{a series}} of {{international}} terrorist bombings that culminate {{in the destruction of}} the fictional Grain Trade Center in Vienna – attacks which are quickly attributed to the Brotherhood of Nod - the United Nations Security Council realizes that Kane <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> are commencing a global campaign of terrorism, and authorises the Global Defense Initiative to intervene on its behalf,setting a conflict in motion that escalates into a world war.|$|E
5|$|Command & Conquer {{requires}} the player {{to construct a}} base and to gather resources in order to fund the production of buildings, technologies, and combat units to attack and conquer an opponent's base. The game contains two playable factions: the Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and the Brotherhood of Nod. GDI units are sturdy and powerful, but expensive. Meanwhile, Nod armies {{are made up of}} a mix of cheap and numerous units, mixed in with unusual units such as rocket bikes and stealth tanks. As a result, GDI focuses on large-scale strategic attacks, while Nod creates bigger armies and uses unconventional tactics. There are roughly fifty units and structures in total. Tiberium, the game's sole resource, is gathered by harvester units that carry it to a refinery structure for processing. When the player constructs buildings, additional units and structures become available for purchase. Command & Conquer features two single-player campaigns, one each for the GDI <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> factions. The objective of most campaign missions is to destroy or take control of enemy buildings. The missions begin with live-action full motion video (FMV) cutscenes.|$|E
25|$|Eugene Field Park {{is located}} on 16 acres of land along the North Branch of the Chicago River in the Northwest Side {{neighborhood}} of Albany Park. The river cuts a diagonal path across the park site. Originally, the park was one of 2 parks commissioned by the now defunct Albany Park District. The Albany Park District made the first land purchases for what was then known as Central Park in 1923, but park improvements were not undertaken until 1925. The Albany Park District officially changed the park's name from Central Park to Eugene Field Park in November 1926. The park is named for Eugene Field, an important American writer; Field's name may have been selected through a contest held by the park district. He was born in St. Louis but lived in Chicago after 1883 where {{he worked as a}} journalist. Field {{is best known for his}} work as a children's poet (Wynken, Blynken, <b>and</b> <b>Nod,</b> Little Boy Blue).|$|E

500|$|Designers {{improved}} on {{the design}} of the Batsuit from Batman Begins, adding wide elastic banding to help bind the costume to Bale, and suggest more sophisticated technology. It was constructed from 200 individual pieces of rubber, fiberglass, metallic mesh, and nylon. The new cowl was modeled after a motorcycle helmet and separated from the neck piece, allowing Bale to turn his head left and right <b>and</b> <b>nod</b> up and down. The cowl is equipped to show white lenses over the eyes when the character turns on his sonar detection, which gives Batman the white eyed look from the comics and animation. The gauntlets have retractable razors which can be fired. Though the new costume is eight pounds heavier, Bale found it more comfortable and not as hot to wear. The depiction of Gotham City is less gritty than in Batman Begins. [...] "I've tried to unclutter the Gotham we created on the last film," [...] said production designer Nathan Crowley. [...] "Gotham is in chaos. We keep blowing up stuff, so we can keep our images clean." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Ron and {{the others}} deal with their meetings: April acts as uninterested as possible, Andy makes {{promises}} to people against Ron's wishes, and Ann provides several medical consults after revealing she is really a nurse (not a parks and recreation department employee). Although the two had previously been developing a romantic interest, Andy now acts uninterested in April because he feels uncomfortable about the eight-year age difference between them, further upsetting April on a difficult day. Ron, who views the many meetings as an utter nightmare, calls in the others {{during the middle of}} the day for a progress report, and angrily berates April for her mistake. After all the meetings, April arranges her own meeting with Ron, where she announces she is quitting. When Andy learns this, he convinces Ron that April is a great assistant. Ron goes to April's house and convinces her to come back by telling her about Andy's compliments. April then reveals that she knows Ron is Duke Silver, since her mother is a huge fan, and that she recognized him the first time that they met. On her first day back, April successfully scares off someone wanting to meet with Ron by scheduling absurd meeting dates and times such as June 50th, the [...] "one-teenth" [...] of [...] "march-tember" [...] and 2:65 PM. Ron gives her an approving smile <b>and</b> <b>nod</b> while watching from his office.|$|E
500|$|In Act I Pan {{challenges}} Apollo to {{a musical}} contest, with Tmolus as the judge. Tmolus awards the victory to Apollo. Pan challenges his decision, asking the mortal King Midas {{to decide the}} contest. Midas has a bias towards Pan and decides in favour of him. Apollo, upset at this mortal's interference in immortal affairs, punishes Midas by turning his ears into ass's ears, saying [...] "thus to the world / Wear thou the marks of what thou art, / Let Pan himself blush at such a judge". Zopyrion, Midas's prime minister, helps the king figure out to hide his ears: they design a crown to hide them. Although Zopyrion is determined to keep the king's secret, he still finds the situation hysterical. When he encounters Asphalion, a courtier, he misunderstands him and thinks that Asphalion also knows the secret. Asphalion discovers he has a secret, but not what it is. After Asphalion leaves, Zopyrion whispers the secret to the [...] "greenest reeds that sway / <b>And</b> <b>nod</b> your feathered heads beneath the sun". Bacchus then arrives, searching for Silenus. Bacchus decides to reward Midas for his hospitality and offers to grant him any wish he wants. Although his prime minister suggests that he wish for his original ears back, Midas wishes that everything he touches be turned to gold. During this conversation, Midas is convinced he hears Zopyrion whispering his secret, but it is really the reeds saying [...] "Midas, the king, has the ears of an ass." ...|$|E

2500|$|At Stephen King's request, Ellison {{provided}} {{a description of}} himself and his writing in Danse Macabre. [...] "My work is foursquare for chaos. I spend my life personally, and my work professionally, keeping the soup boiling. [...] {{is what they call}} you when you are no longer dangerous; I much prefer troublemaker, malcontent, desperado. I see myself as a combination of Zorro and Jiminy Cricket. My stories go out from here and raise hell. From time to time some denigrater or critic with umbrage will say of my work, 'He only wrote that to shock.' I smile <b>and</b> <b>nod.</b> Precisely." ...|$|E
