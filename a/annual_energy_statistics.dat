This paper explores {{the internal consistency of}} China's <b>energy</b> <b>statistics</b> from 1990 to 2000, coverage and reporting issues, and the state of the statistical reporting system. Available information suggests that, while <b>energy</b> <b>statistics</b> were probably relatively good in the early 1990 s, their quality has declined since the mid- 1990 s. China's <b>energy</b> <b>statistics</b> should be treated {{as a starting point for}} analysis, and explicit judgments regarding ranges of uncertainty should accompany any conclusions...|$|R

40|$|Monitoring energy {{efficiency}} improvements {{is essential for}} policy evaluation and for future policy making. We estimate the <b>annual</b> <b>energy</b> efficiency improvements achieved in six Dutch industry sectors between 1993 and 2008 by using a bottom-up model. This model incorporates the production data and specific energy consumption values of 122 products. We estimate <b>annual</b> <b>energy</b> efficiency improvements of 1. 0 % per annum (p. a.) for the total industry (excluding non-energy use); even though the results are subject to uncertainties due to errors in the <b>energy</b> <b>statistics,</b> we consider them as strong indication that Dutch industry needs to reinforce its efforts in {{energy efficiency}}. Based on historical achievements between 1989 and 2008, Business as Usual (BaU) scenarios project annual improvement potentials of 0. 6 – 1. 8 % p. a. until 2040. Based on literature review, this study estimates that implementing energy saving technologies can accelerate energy efficiency improvements to 2 % p. a. and beyond. Efficient {{combined heat and power}} technologies could increase these potentials further. These are beyond the historical achievements and BaU scenario projections. New policies will be required for technology development which ensures continuous energy efficiency improvements. The findings of this paper need to be extended by continuous monitoring and more scenario analyses with improved data...|$|R

40|$|A common {{disadvantage}} in existing distribution-free two-sample testing approaches {{is that the}} computational complexity could be high. Specifically, if the sample size is N, the computational complexity of those two-sample tests is at least O(N^ 2). In this paper, we develop an efficient algorithm with complexity O(N N) for computing <b>energy</b> <b>statistics</b> in univariate cases. For multivariate cases, we introduce a two-sample test based on <b>energy</b> <b>statistics</b> and random projections, which enjoys the O(K N N) computational complexity, where K {{is the number of}} random projections. We name our method for multivariate cases as Randomly Projected <b>Energy</b> <b>Statistics</b> (RPES).

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of China's <b>energy</b> <b>statistics</b> {{is of great}} concern because it contributes greatly to the uncertainties in estimates of global emissions. This study attempts to improve the understanding of uncertainties in China's <b>energy</b> <b>statistics</b> and evaluate their impacts on China's emissions {{during the period of}} 1990 – 2013. We employed the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC) model to calculate China's emissions based on different official data sets of <b>energy</b> <b>statistics</b> using the same emission factors. We found that the apparent uncertainties (maximum discrepancy) in China's energy consumption increased from 2004 to 2012, reaching a maximum of 646  Mtce (million tons of coal equivalent) in 2011 and that coal dominated these uncertainties. The discrepancies between the national and provincial <b>energy</b> <b>statistics</b> were reduced after the three economic censuses conducted during this period, and converging uncertainties were found in 2013. The emissions calculated from the provincial <b>energy</b> <b>statistics</b> are generally higher than those calculated from the national <b>energy</b> <b>statistics,</b> and the apparent uncertainty ratio (the ratio of the maximum discrepancy to the mean value) owing to energy uncertainties in 2012 took values of 30. 0, 16. 4, 7. 7, 9. 2 and 15. 6  %, for SO 2, NO x, VOC, PM 2. 5 and CO 2 emissions, respectively. SO 2 emissions are most sensitive to energy uncertainties because of the high contributions from industrial coal combustion. The calculated emission trends are also greatly affected by energy uncertainties – from 1996 to 2012, CO 2 and NO x emissions, respectively, increased by 191 and 197  % according to the provincial <b>energy</b> <b>statistics</b> but by only 145 and 139  % as determined from the original national <b>energy</b> <b>statistics.</b> The energy-induced emission uncertainties for some species such as SO 2 and NO x are comparable to total uncertainties of emissions as estimated by previous studies, indicating variations in energy consumption could be an important source of China's emission uncertainties. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>statistics</b> was {{proposed}} by Székely in the 80 's {{inspired by the}} Newtonian gravitational potential from classical mechanics, and it provides a hypothesis test for equality of distributions. It was further generalized from Euclidean spaces to metric spaces of strong negative type, and more recently, a connection with reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) was established. Here we consider the clustering problem from an <b>energy</b> <b>statistics</b> theory perspective, providing a precise mathematical formulation yielding a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) in the associated RKHS, thus establishing the connection with kernel methods. We show that this QCQP is equivalent to kernel k-means optimization problem once the kernel is fixed. These results imply a first principles derivation of kernel k-means from <b>energy</b> <b>statistics.</b> However, <b>energy</b> <b>statistics</b> fixes a family of standard kernels. Furthermore, we also consider a weighted version of <b>energy</b> <b>statistics,</b> making connection to graph partitioning problems. To find local optimizers of such QCQP we propose an iterative algorithm based on Hartigan's method, {{which in this case}} has the same computational cost as kernel k-means algorithm, based on Lloyd's heuristic, but usually with better clustering quality. We provide carefully designed numerical experiments showing the superiority of the proposed method compared to kernel k-means, spectral clustering, standard k-means, and Gaussian mixture models in a variety of settings...|$|R
40|$|Consistent and {{reliable}} <b>energy</b> <b>statistics</b> are of vital importance for proper monitoring of energy-efficiency policies. In recent studies, irregularities {{have been reported}} in the Dutch <b>energy</b> <b>statistics</b> for the chemical industry. We studied in depth the company data that form the basis of the <b>energy</b> <b>statistics</b> in the Netherlands between 1995 and 2004 to find causes for these irregularities. We discovered that chemical products have occasionally been included, resulting in statistics with an inconsistent system boundary. Lack of guidance in the survey for the complex energy conversions in the chemical industry in the survey also resulted in large fluctuations for certain energy commodities. The findings of our analysis have been the basis for a new survey that has been used since 2007. We demonstrate that the annual questionnaire used for the international <b>energy</b> <b>statistics</b> can result in comparable problems as observed in the Netherlands. We suggest to include chemical residual gas as energy commodity in the questionnaire and to include the energy conversions in the chemical industry in the international <b>energy</b> <b>statistics.</b> In addition, we think the questionnaire should be explicit about the treatment of basic chemical products produced at refineries and in the petrochemical industry to avoid system boundary problems. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology for {{the integration of}} dispatchable and nondispatchable renewable distributed generation (DG) units for minimizing <b>annual</b> <b>energy</b> losses. In this methodology, analytical expressions are first proposed to identify the optimal size and power factor of DG unit simultaneously for each location for minimizing power losses. These expressions are then adapted to place renewable DG units for minimizing <b>annual</b> <b>energy</b> losses while considering the time-varying characteristics of demand and generation. A combination of dispatchable and nondispatchable DG units is also proposed in this paper. The proposed methodology {{has been applied to}} a 69 -bus test distribution system with different scenarios. The results demonstrate that dispatchable DG units or a combination of dispatchable and nondispatchable DG units can lead to a substantial reduction in <b>annual</b> <b>energy</b> losses when compared to nondispatchable DG units. The results also show that a maximum <b>annual</b> <b>energy</b> loss reduction is achieved for all scenarios proposed with DG operation at optimal power factor. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
