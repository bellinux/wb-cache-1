40|$|During {{the last}} decade several {{empirical}} studies have {{stressed the importance of}} norms and social interactions for explaining sickness absence behavior. In this context public discussions about the intentions of the insurance, and of the rights and duties of the receivers, may be important for reducing the sickness absence. In this paper we study whether information <b>meetings</b> about <b>the</b> Swedish sickness insurance affect the length of sickness absence spells. The study is based on experimental data on individuals with weak labor market attachments. The displacement of when <b>the</b> call <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>meeting</b> was sent out was randomized. Comparing the survival functions of those called immediately with those whose calls were delayed (by about 30 days) makes it possible <b>to</b> study whether <b>the</b> length of sickness absence is affected by receiving the call earlier. The result suggests that the length is reduced by, on average, 20 percent. In the long term (12 months later) there is no effect of <b>the</b> information <b>meeting.</b> This suggests that <b>attendance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> information <b>meeting</b> does not change individuals' long-term behavior...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. June 2012. Major: English. Advisor: Paula Rabinowitz. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); iii, 301 pages. While the archival antipodes of accessibility and obfuscation [...] {{of order and}} chaos [...] have long captivated archive readers, such captivation has given way over {{the last thirty years}} to an obsession that, following the translation of Jacques Derrida's Mal d'Archive, is often called a fever. Although in Derrida's iteration, "archive fever" refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> archive's dependence on both preservation and destruction, it refers today both <b>to</b> <b>the</b> archive's promotion of feverish desires (for origins, for authenticity, for paper-bound or otherwise authentic connections) and to readers' often dis-eased responses <b>to</b> <b>the</b> archive as a mediator of conflicting and conflicted meanings. My dissertation, Feverish Fragments and Dis-eased Desire: The Archive as Fiction, argues that as <b>the</b> archive continues <b>to</b> accrue broad symbolic and political significance in contemporary archival discourse and beyond, it is increasingly necessary <b>to</b> investigate <b>the</b> aetiology of its production of fevers. I consequently maintain that a full investigation of the archive's current dis-eased status demands <b>attendance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> words of critics and other specialized archive readers, <b>attendance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> experiences of less professional or professionalized readers, <b>attendance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> archives and archivists themselves, and, as importantly, <b>attendance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fiction that takes the archive as subject and theme...|$|R

40|$|Assistance in {{childbirth}} differed in various cultural communities and historical periods. However, childbirth {{was always a}} family matter in which father participated either directly or indirectly. The last ten years revealed {{that the role of}} a man was absolutely irreplaceable in the relationship between mother, a new-born child and father, and that the role reflected itself in the relationship not only with mother [...] the mate but also with the child. The objective of the bachelor thesis was to ascertain <b>to</b> what extent <b>the</b> father's <b>attendance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> childbirth was a spontaneous wish of both <b>the</b> parents, and <b>to</b> what extent it was rather a wish of the woman in childbed. On the basis of my own experience, the following hypothesis was determined: "Fathers <b>attendance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> childbirth is predominantly a spontaneous wish of both the parents. In order <b>to</b> verify <b>the</b> hypothesis, I used the form of a quantitative research. The data were collected using the questionnaire containing 16 questions for mothers and 16 questions for fathers. The questions for both the groups of informants were identical. The questionnaire was anonymous. The research group consisted of the mothers giving birth to their child in the hospital in České Budějovice (a joint stock company) and their mates attending <b>to</b> <b>the</b> childbirth. The research group comprised 56 pairs of informants. The results of the thesis reveal that <b>the</b> mates <b>attendance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> childbirth is largely a spontaneous wish of the parents-to-be. It is obvious that as early as during the pregnancy the fathers-to-be search for the information on gravidity and childbirth. They enjoy the pregnancy together with their mates and do not assume an uninterested attitude <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gravidity of their mates. Active preparation of the pairs for the childbirth is also apparent. Assessment of negatives and positives of fathers <b>attendance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> childbirth is subjective and very individual. If <b>the</b> mates <b>attendance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> childbirth is a common wish of both the parents-to-be, the delivery of their child is an invaluable experience in their life...|$|R
