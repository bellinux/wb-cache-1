5|$|The Chinese never {{spotted the}} D-21B. The first one failed {{to turn around}} and {{continued}} straight on, crashing somewhere in the Soviet Union. Another test flight was conducted on 20 February 1970 in a successful attempt to correct any problems. The second operational mission, however, was not until 16 December 1970. The D-21B reached Lop Nor <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> recovery point, but the hatch had a partial parachute failure and was lost at sea with its photographs.|$|E

5|$|Amphibians have a {{juvenile}} stage and an adult stage, and the circulatory {{systems of the}} two are distinct. In the juvenile (or tadpole) stage, the circulation {{is similar to that}} of a fish; the two-chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated, and is spread around the body <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heart in a single loop. In the adult stage, amphibians (especially frogs) lose their gills and develop lungs. They have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria. When the ventricle starts contracting, deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs. Continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body. Mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers.|$|E
5|$|Back to the Future was {{released}} on July 3, 1985, grossing over $381 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1985. It won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film, and the Academy Award for Best Sound Effects Editing, as well as receiving three additional Academy Award nominations, five BAFTA nominations, and four Golden Globe nominations, including Best Motion Picture (Musical or Comedy). Ronald Reagan even quoted the film in his 1986 State of the Union Address. In 2007, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry, and in June 2008 the American Film Institute's special AFI's 10 Top 10 designated the film as the 10th-best film in the science fiction genre. The film {{marked the beginning of}} a franchise, with two sequels, Back to the Future Part II (1989) <b>and</b> <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Future Part III (1990), as well as an animated series, , several video games and a forthcoming musical.|$|E

5|$|Business US Highway 127 (Bus. US127) is a {{business}} loop that runs from an interchange on US127 on the southern Ithaca city limits through downtown <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> freeway north of the city. The southern end is at exit117 on US127, and from there, the business loop runs westward along Center Street through a cluster of businesses adjacent to the freeway interchange. Further west, Bus. US127 passes through residential neighborhoods to enter downtown Ithaca. At Main Street, the business loop turns northward one block to Emerson, then turns westward one block along Emerson to Pine River Street, bypassing downtown Ithaca. From there, Bus. US127 turns northward along the former route of US27 through town. North of downtown, the highway passes through another residential area before exiting Ithaca. North of town, the business loop passes a golf course before turning eastward a short distance along Polk Road to connect to the freeway.|$|E
5|$|Capillaries are {{organized}} into capillary beds in tissues; {{it is here}} that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart. Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Bella was a {{destructive}} tropical cyclone that passed near the Mauritius outer island of Rodrigues. The second named storm of the season, Bella {{originated in the}} middle of January 1991 from a surge in the monsoon trough to the southwest of Sumatra. For several days, the system remained weak as it moved generally west-southwestward. On January25, it intensified to tropical storm status, but Bella took three more days to intensify to tropical cyclone status, with 10minute maximum sustained winds of 120kilometres per hour (75miles per hour). The cyclone attained peak intensity on January29, officially reaching winds of 155km/h (100mph). The Joint Typhoon Warning Center unofficially estimated winds of 240km/h (150mph), the highest the agency estimated for any storm in the Southern Hemisphere in the year. Bella later turned to the southeast and weakened, passing about 50km (30mi) west of Rodrigues on January31. The storm turned to the south-southwest <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southeast again, becoming extratropical on February4.|$|E

The highway has a short northeast section <b>and</b> then curves <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southeast. It then crosses over the North Fork Nolin River. It then curves <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east-northeast and meets its eastern terminus, an intersection with KY 84 (Tanner Road), {{at a point}} southwest of Hodgenville.|$|R

5|$|III. Menuetto: Allegro – Trio. This is {{a somber}} movement, quite {{distinct}} from the typical atmosphere of dance movements. It is relatively conservative in its key scheme, moving to the relative major key <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tonic. In the B section, a sequence of hemiolas is interrupted by a dramatic interpolation in A-flat major, referencing the departure to this key in {{the opening of the}} Allegro with the added minor 6th. The second A section is a transformation of the first, interrupted every four bars by a silent bar, creating a mysterious atmosphere. The trio is in A-flat major, ternary form, with a B section beginning in E-flat major colored by its own minor 6th, and modulating to G-flat major via the parallel minor.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, leaks in {{the mall}} roof and mold caused Elliot Lake city councilors to {{consider}} moving the Elliot Lake Public Library out of the mall <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Solomon Building, {{where it had been}} before 1992. Many books were damaged, despite library staff using tarps to cover shelves. At some points, entire sections were blocked for public health reasons. Much of the leaking was said to be corrected, before council considered the issue, and an environmental study was completed. Some library board members and councilors worried that liability insurance wouldn't cover them {{in the mall}}, despite reassurances by library management and the city's insurance broker. With a multi-use complex in the works, some of the library board was concerned with a five-year lease that mall management was pursuing, despite the library's preference for a 2.5-year lease. In the end, the library remained at the mall.|$|E
5|$|In Jötunheimr, the jötunn Þrymr {{sits on a}} barrow, {{plaiting}} golden collars for {{his female}} dogs, and trimming the manes of his horses. Þrymr sees Loki, and asks what could be amiss among the Æsir and the elves; why is Loki alone in Jötunheimr? Loki responds that he has bad news for both the elves and the Æsir—that Thor's hammer, Mjöllnir, is gone. Þrymr {{says that he has}} hidden Mjöllnir eight leagues beneath the earth, from which it will be retrieved, but only if Freyja is brought to him as his wife. Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling, away from Jötunheimr <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> court of the gods.|$|E

Because it existed in both the eastern and western Pacific, John {{was one of a}} small number of tropical cyclones to be designated as both a hurricane and a typhoon. Despite lasting for a full month, John barely affected land at all, bringing only minimal effects to the Hawaiian Islands and the United States military base on Johnston Atoll. Its remnants later affected Alaska.|$|E
5|$|Plug-in {{electric}} vehicles offer users {{the opportunity to}} sell electricity stored in their batteries back to the power grid, thereby helping utilities to operate more efficiently {{in the management of}} their demand peaks. A vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system would take advantage of the fact that most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time. During such idle times the electricity stored in the batteries could be transferred from the PEV to the power lines <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> grid. In the U.S this transfer back to the grid have an estimated value to the utilities of up to $4,000 per year per car. In a V2G system it would also be expected that battery electric (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) would have the capability to communicate automatically with the power grid to sell demand response services by either delivering electricity into the grid or by throttling their charging rate.|$|E

This successful, seven-month-long British Empire campaign, begun at Romani in August, ended at the First Battle of Gaza in March 1917.|$|E

Past this area, the road continues through wooded areas of homes, with the forests becoming denser as the road heads more to the northeast. In the village of Centre Bridge, PA 263 signage ends at PA 32 (River Road). The route officially continues to the Centre Bridge-Stockton Bridge over the Delaware River, at which point it ends. The road continues into Stockton, New Jersey as Bridge Street, which heads to an intersection with Route 29 near the southern terminus of County Route 523.|$|E
5|$|The {{systemic}} {{heart has}} muscular contractile walls {{and consists of}} a single ventricle and two atria, one for {{each side of the}} body. The blood vessels consist of arteries, capillaries and veins and are lined with a cellular endothelium which is quite unlike that of most other invertebrates. The blood circulates through the aorta and capillary system, to the vena cavae, after which the blood is pumped through the gills by the auxiliary hearts <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main heart. Much of the venous system is contractile, which helps circulate the blood.|$|E
5|$|There are {{currently}} four business routes of Interstate69 (I-69) in the US state of Michigan. Designated Business Loop Interstate69 (BL I-69), {{they are all}} former routings of I-69's predecessor highways, US Highway27 (US27), M-78 or M-21, {{in whole or in}} part. The BL I-69 in Coldwater and the one in Charlotte were both parts of US27 before the freeway bypassed those two cities in 1967 and the early 1970s, respectively. The BL I-69 through Lansing and East Lansing was previously part of M-78 and Temporary I-69 until it was redesignated in 1987. Before 1984, the loop in Port Huron was originally part of M-21 and was initially a business spur numbered Business Spur Interstate69 (BS I-69). It was later redesignated when it was extended to run concurrently with that city's BL I-94 which was originally part of I-94's predecessor, US25. Each business loop follows streets through each city's downtown areas and connects to I-69 on both ends, giving traffic a route through the downtown <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> freeway.|$|E
