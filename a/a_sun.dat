5|$|Johnson further {{established}} himself as a quality player in Phoenix. In his three years as <b>a</b> <b>Sun,</b> Johnson averaged 14–20 points a game and provided tough defense. He played in two All-Star Games, was voted into three consecutive All-Defensive First Teams and earned his only All-NBA First Team appearance. In this period Johnson, like in Seattle, played shooting guard and became the main scorer on the team, as opposed to being the second or third option as a Sonic.|$|E

5|$|A four-sport athlete at Kathleen High School, Mitchell {{committed}} to UCLA {{to play football}} for the Bruins. In his collegiate debut in 1998, he had four receptions for 108yards, including a 79-yard touchdown from Cade McNown, {{as well as a}} 34-yard touchdown pass to Brian Poli-Dixon. Mitchell broke his femur the following week against Houston and missed most of the season. Limited by a knee cartilage injury throughout the 1999 season, he finished with 38 receptions for 533yards. As a junior in 2000, Mitchell was a Fred Biletnikoff Award finalist and earned first-team All-Pac-10 honors {{at the conclusion of the}} season. In the 2000 Sun Bowl, he had nine catches for <b>a</b> <b>Sun</b> Bowl record of 180yards.

5|$|After {{the end of}} {{his major}} league career, Martin {{returned}} to the minor leagues, serving as a player-manager with the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League in 1945 and 1946 before becoming the player-manager for the Greenville Spinners of the South Atlantic League in 1947. His fiery, competitive nature was still evident in July 1945 when it was reported that he had punched one of his players for not performing to his standards. While managing the Miami Sun Sox of the Florida International League in 1949, he was fined and suspended {{for the remainder of the}} season for choking an umpire. In August 1951, he made news again when he was arrested after <b>a</b> <b>Sun</b> Sox game when he went into the stands to punch a spectator in Lakeland, Florida.|$|E

50|$|The lower tangent arc {{is rarely}} observable, {{appearing}} under and tangent to a 22° halo centred on the sun. Just like upper tangent arcs, {{the shape of}} a lower arc is dependent on the altitude of the <b>sun.</b> <b>As</b> the <b>sun</b> slips over the horizon the lower tangent arc forms a sharp, wing-shaped angle below the <b>sun.</b> <b>As</b> the <b>sun</b> rises above over the horizon, the arc first folds upon itself and then takes {{the shape of a}} wide arc. <b>As</b> the <b>sun</b> reaches 29-32° over the horizon, it finally begins to widen and merge with the upper tangent arc to form the circumscribed halo.|$|R
5|$|Although the Palmyrenes worshiped their deities as individuals, {{some were}} {{associated}} with other gods. Bel had Astarte-Belti as his consort, and formed a triple deity with Aglibol and Yarhibol (who became <b>a</b> <b>sun</b> god in his association with Bel). Malakbel was part of many associations, pairing with Gad Taimi and Aglibol, and forming a triple deity with Baalshamin and Aglibol. Palmyra hosted an Akitu (spring festival) each Nisan. Each of the city's four-quarters had a sanctuary for a deity considered ancestral to the resident tribe; Malakbel and Aglibol's sanctuary was in the Komare quarter. The Baalshamin sanctuary was in the Ma'zin quarter, the Arsu sanctuary in the Mattabol quarter, and the Atargatis sanctuary in the fourth tribe's quarter.|$|E
5|$|Itzamna was {{the creator}} god, {{but he also}} {{embodied}} the cosmos, and was simultaneously <b>a</b> <b>sun</b> god; K'inich Ahau, the day sun, {{was one of his}} aspects. Maya kings frequently identified themselves with K'inich Ahau. Itzamna also had a night sun aspect, the Night Jaguar, representing the sun in its journey through the underworld. The four Pawatuns supported the corners of the mortal realm; in the heavens, the Bacabs performed the same function. As well as their four main aspects, the Bakabs had dozens of other aspects that are not well understood. The four Chaacs were storm gods, controlling thunder, lightning, and the rains. The nine lords of the night each governed one of the underworld realms. Other important deities included the moon goddess, the maize god, and the Hero Twins.|$|E

Mercedes admits that at first the {{kidnapping}} was a scam to get back at Paul Browning (Joe Thompson) for supposedly cheating on her and apologizes to Jacqui. At first Jacqui is furious at Mercedes for this and yells at her causing them both to start crying. After insulting Mercedes Jacqui forgives her and tells her that she love her.

5|$|Starting in 1870, flags {{were created}} for the Japanese Emperor (then Emperor Meiji), the Empress, and for {{other members of the}} {{imperial}} family. At first, the Emperor's flag was ornate, with <b>a</b> <b>sun</b> resting {{in the center of a}}n artistic pattern. He had flags that were used on land, at sea, and when he was in a carriage. The imperial family was also granted flags to be used at sea and while on land (one for use on foot and one carriage flag). The carriage flags were a monocolored chrysanthemum, with 16 petals, placed in the center of a monocolored background. These flags were discarded in 1889 when the Emperor decided to use the chrysanthemum on a red background as his flag. With minor changes in the color shades and proportions, the flags adopted in 1889 are still in use by the imperial family.|$|E
5|$|The 1947 Sun Bowl {{game was}} held as the {{culminating}} {{event of the}} Sun Carnival and was held at 15,000-seat Kidd Field {{on the campus of}} Texas Western University, today known as the University of Texas El Paso. The matchup of Virginia Tech and Cincinnati was out of character for the Sun Bowl, which traditionally matched the champion of the Border Conference with the best possible opponent. Hardin-Simmons University, champions of the Border Conference, declined <b>a</b> <b>Sun</b> Bowl bid, as did the second-place team, Texas Tech. With no other option, a member of the Sun Bowl Committee—who happened to be an alumnus of Virginia Tech—suggested inviting the Hokies to play against Cincinnati, which had already accepted an invitation.|$|E
5|$|The divisional {{insignia}} was <b>a</b> <b>sun</b> with 16 rays, {{the ancient}} {{symbol of the}} Macedonian king Alexander the Great. A divisional collar patch bearing the insignia was intended, but it is unlikely it was ever issued. During their formation and training in the Bácska region {{during the summer of}} 1944, the soldiers often dressed in khaki tropical uniforms with shorts. The official headgear of the division was the SS M43 fez: a field gray model to be worn with service uniform and a red model for dress uniform. Members of the division that had previously served in the 13th SS Division often continued to wear the divisional collar patch of that division, which showed an arm holding a scimitar over a swastika. These non-standard uniform items continued to be worn by members of the division after they became part of the 31st SS Division in October 1944.|$|E
50|$|Stormworld has {{geography}} that is {{very different}} from Earth. The first major difference easily noticed are the three suns: <b>a</b> yellow <b>sun,</b> <b>a</b> blue <b>sun</b> and <b>a</b> red <b>sun.</b> The three <b>suns</b> have <b>a</b> strong effect on the geography, flora and fauna of the planet. Because of the increased solar radiation, Stormworld is a very hot planet. This heat means there is a severe lack of fresh water available for the inhabitants. Water rationing and conservation is everyone's first concern. The lack of water also means fewer plants or animals are available as food sources.|$|R
