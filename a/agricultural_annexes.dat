50|$|Without {{the usual}} {{hierarchical}} dialogue between a dominant manorial house and <b>agricultural</b> <b>annexes,</b> {{the design of}} the villa might represent the product of a precise initiative {{on the part of the}} patrons and reflect the heterodox and egalitarian ideas of the Repeta family (Mario Repeta was denounced to the Holy Office in 1569), restless protagonists in the public life of Vicenza during the 16th century (Cinquecento).|$|E
50|$|Constructed and {{inhabited}} in 1556, {{the villa}} therefore functioned {{for the management}} of the fields and was simultaneously a visible sign of the “feudal” presence, so to speak, of Badoer in the territory: it is not coincidental that the building rises on the site of an ancient medieval castle. Palladio succeeded in uniting within one effective synthesis these dual meanings, joining the majestic manor house to the two barchesse (farm wings) bent into semicircles, which screen the stables and other <b>agricultural</b> <b>annexes.</b>|$|E
50|$|From archival {{documents}} one realises {{that the}} enormous columns {{are not the}} fragments of a monumental barchessa, like that for the Villa Pisani at Bagnolo, but rather of the façade of a true and proper country residence. The enormous Corinthian colonnade, a direct quotation from the pronaos of the Pantheon, would have reached an overall height of over thirteen metres. Lower porticoes, on a quarter-circle plan and still visible in the 19th century, would have tied the manorial house to <b>agricultural</b> <b>annexes</b> to left and right.|$|E
50|$|Located just to {{the west}} of the Princes' Gates at the eastern end of Exhibition Place, it was {{previously}} the site of a streetcar loop and open space. The new building took over the frontage along Prince's Boulevard and connected to the existing Coliseum and Industry Buildings (also known as the <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Annex),</b> creating a large inter-connected exhibition complex. The existing southern entrance of the Coliseum was demolished and integrated into the new complex. The streetcar loop was moved to the north of the complex. The open space was previously the site of the Engineering and Electrical Building, opened in 1928 and torn down in 1972.|$|R

50|$|As United States {{representative}} to Liberia {{as well as}} agent of the ACS, Ashmun effectively became governor of the colony from 1822 to 1828, from ages 28 to 34. He took {{a leadership role in}} what he found to be a demoralized colony and helped build the defenses of Monrovia, as well as building up trade. During his tenure in Liberia, Ashmun increased <b>agricultural</b> production, <b>annexed</b> more tribal land from the natives, and exploited commercial opportunities in the interior.|$|R
5000|$|Estate of Falcão (Quinta do Falcão), a large {{tract of}} land {{near the edge of}} Almagreira's western border, which was once the {{residence}} of magristrate/judge Falcão, {{who was one of the}} politico-administrative leaders of the early settlement of Vila do Porto. The estate is made of the red-brick masonry typical of the region; the complex consists of a residence, stables, <b>agricultural</b> <b>annexes,</b> cistern and overlook, accessible from the main road by a grand portico in a neoclassical design that includes a long entrance corridor to the main house.|$|E
50|$|Settlement of the {{depopulated}} {{village with}} Jewish war refugees, {{and later by}} new immigrants, began two weeks after its conquest. On 10 December 1948, Salamah {{and some of its}} <b>agricultural</b> land was <b>annexed</b> to Tel Aviv. Today the village site is part of the Kfar Shalem neighborhood of Tel Aviv.|$|R
50|$|This {{spring is}} {{known from the}} {{beginning}} of the Moorish settlement. Nowadays it is embellished and completely restored. Water from this source is natural and it flows through five pipes.In the area of the Fuente Grande, there have been found the archaeological remains of the Roman era, demonstrating the existence of population in antiquity. Excavations are being carried out to determine the type of site, which appears to be a villa with <b>annexes</b> <b>agricultural</b> production and ceramics.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally an Anglophonic European American settlement, Salinas became {{home to a}} {{significant}} Asian minority who joined European-American immigrants in the agriculture and fishing industries {{at the turn of}} the 20th century. Meanwhile, the neighboring and, at the time, unincorporated community of Alisal became a mecca for Hispanic immigrants primarily from Mexico, drawn to opportunities in the area's <b>agricultural</b> industry. When <b>annexed</b> in 1963, Alisal was described as a large Mexican-American enclave, added to a city that was still otherwise majority European-American.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{building}} was constructed after a general {{model of a}} cotton factory, as suggested by Mr. Atkinson, the form being a Greek cross, the transept nearly half the length, the <b>agricultural</b> and carriage <b>annexes</b> extending along the southern side, and the mineral and woods department forming an annex at the extreme western end of the building. Its extreme length was seven hundred and twenty feet, {{the length of the}} transport four hundred feet, and the width of the arms ninety-six feet. The dimensions of the remaining principal buildings were as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|Following {{the conquest}} of Poland by Nazi Germany and the USSR, the country's most fertile <b>agricultural</b> land was <b>annexed</b> to Germany in October 1939. The {{remaining}} area of German-occupied Poland (the General Government) did not produce enough food to feed its population. National Socialist People's Welfare, Nazi Germany relief service, was not providing adequate service and very soon started to exclude Jews from its aid programmes. Herbert Hoover testified before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs that around 400 to 500 million US dollars {{would be needed to}} feed approximately 7 million of destitute people in Poland, and argued that at least a quarter of that should be provided by the USA.|$|R
30|$|The main {{characteristic}} of pastoralism impacting on statistical visibility is the mobility required by effective dryland pastoral production (Bonnet and Bertrand 2014; de Jode 2010; Homewood 2008; Kratli et al. 2014). In the colonial era, considerable {{proportions of the}} arid lands’ populations were mobile pastoralists and a nomadic lifestyle was widespread; controlling and managing this mobility was often seen as a major challenge by colonial regimes, and in British East Africa, many dry season pastures with substantial <b>agricultural</b> potential were <b>annexed</b> by colonial farmers (Spear and Waller 1993; Hughes 2006; Lane 1996). Diverse ethnic and linguistically defined populations practise extensive pastoralism with various degrees of mobility; they demonstrate great heterogeneity in social organisation and relationships {{with each other and}} with other, more sedentary populations. There has always been considerable flexibility about the coexistence of pastoralism with other economic activities such as agriculture, trade, mining and seasonal labour to urban areas. Individuals, families and entire populations have moved in and out of mobile livestock keeping in times of drought or disease (Spear and Waller 1993; Bonfiglioli 1990; Little and Leslie 1999; Brainard 1991; Fratkin and Roth 2005; Toupet 1977).|$|R
