The performance of <b>automotive</b> <b>radars</b> may be degraded by interference from nearby radars using the same frequency. In this study, a scenario where two cars pass each other on a road was considered. Considering the utilization of cross-polarization, the desired-to-undesired signal power ratio (DUR) was found to vary approximately from - 10 to 30 dB. Different pseudo random sequences were employed for spectrum spreading the different radar signals to mitigate the interference effects. This paper evaluates the interference suppression provided by maximum length sequence (MLS) and Gold sequence (GS) through numerical simulations of the radar’s performance in terms of probability of false alarm and probability of detection. It was found that MLS and GS yielded nearly the same performance when the DUR is - 10 dB (worst case); for example when fixing the probability of false alarm to 0. 0001, the probabilities of detection were 0. 964 and 0. 946 respectively. The GS are more advantageous than MLS due to larger number of different sequences having the same length in GS than in MLS...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of rotating steel platform in the RCS (Radar Cross Section) measurement of vehicles at 22 - 26 GHz for <b>automotive</b> <b>radar</b> application. Across several measurement steps, we compare different RCS measurement results in order to eliminate the undesired RCS contribution caused mainly by the rotating steel platform. We demonstrate that when it is difficult or impossible to use microwave absorbers on the steel platform, an alternative method can be applied. Finally, {{with the help of}} 2 D radar image post processing, we can also identify and separate the RCS contribution of each element (vehicle, steel platform, ground/multipath/clutter) in the hologram image, and therefore obtain the pure RCS distribution of the tested vehicle. key words – RCS, hologram, radar image, <b>automotive</b> <b>radar</b> I. CONTEXT 24 GHz UWB (Ultra Wide Band) [21. 65 - 26. 65 GHz] <b>automotive</b> <b>radar</b> systems are very popular on the market since they provide most of the driving assistance options at a competitive cost [1] [2]. However, in Europe, regulation and permission of 24 GHz UWB for <b>automotive</b> <b>radar</b> is limited in time. Initially, European Commission (EC) decided the cut-off date would be July 2012, but this date is postponed till January 2018 for new vehicle registration and till January 2022 for vehicles registered before 2018 [3]. Therefore, 26 GHz UWB [24 - 29 GHz] will be ready as a replacement for 24 GHz UWB during the cut-off date. Indeed the shift to the 26 GHz band would be much easier to achieve. Moreover, this technology is allowed with no time limit. This paper deals with RCS measurement of vehicles in the frequency of 22 - 26 GHz for <b>automotive</b> <b>radar</b> application. II.

40|$|Abstract — Anti-collision radars {{are used}} in {{automobiles}} applications to prevent accidents of vehicles by detecting obstacles {{in front of the}} vehicles. Generally the correlation radars are used for this purpose, which compute the distance and the relative speed between the vehicles, but problem is that the correlation radars are not capable to measure the angle.

The proposed radar uses the two receiver concept to measure the angle of the object. The capability to angle measurement also increases the application area of this correlation radar.

40|$|This master thesis covers {{two major}} topics, {{the first is}} the use of Advance driver {{assistance}} system (ADAS) sensors for human detection, and second is the use of ADAS sensors for the odometry estimation of the mobile work machine. Solid-state Lidar and <b>Automotive</b> <b>Radar</b> sensors are used as the ADAS sensors. Real-time Simulink models are created for both the sensors. The data is collected from the sensors by connecting the sensors with the XPC target via CAN communication. Later the data is later sent to Robot operating system (ROS) for visualization. The testing of the Solid-state Lidar and <b>Automotive</b> <b>Radar</b> sensors has been performed in different conditions and scenarios, it isn’t limited to human detection only. Detection of cars, machines, building, fence and other multiple objects have also been tested. Moreover, the two major cases for the testing of the sensors were the static case and the dynamic case. For the static case, both the sensors were mounted on a stationary rack and the moving/stationary objects were detected by the sensors. For the dynamic case, both the sensors were mounted on the GIM mobile machine, and the machine was driven around for the sensors to detect an object in the environment. The results are promising, and it is concluded that the sensors can be used for the human detection and for some other applications as well. Furthermore, this research presents an algorithm used to estimate the complete odometry/ ego-motion of the mobile work machine. For this purpose, we are using an <b>automotive</b> <b>radar</b> sensor. Using this sensor and a gyroscope, we seek a complete odometry of the GIM mobile machine, which includes 2 -components of linear speed (forward and side slip) and a single component of angular speed. Kinematic equations are calculated having the constraints of vehicle motion and stationary points in the environment. Radial velocity and the azimuth angle of the objects detected are the major components of the kinematic equations provided by the <b>automotive</b> <b>radar</b> sensor. A stationary environment is a compulsory clause in accurate estimation of radar odometry. Assuming the points detected by the <b>automotive</b> <b>radar</b> sensor are stationary, it is then possible to calculate all the three unknown components of speed. However, it is impossible to calculate all the three components using a single radar sensor, because the latter system of equation becomes singular. Literature suggests use of multiple radar sensors, however, in this research, a vertical gyroscope is used to overcome this singularity. GIM mobile machine having a single <b>automotive</b> <b>radar</b> sensor and a vertical gyroscope is used for the experimentation. The results have been compared with the algorithm presented in [32] as well as the wheel odometry of the GIM mobile machine.

40|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} <b>automotive</b> <b>radars</b> employ multidimensional discrete Fourier transforms (DFT) {{in order}} to estimate various target parameters. The DFT is implemented using the fast Fourier transform (FFT), at sample and computational complexity of O(N) and O(N N), respectively, where N {{is the number of}} samples in the signal space. We have recently proposed a sparse Fourier transform based on the Fourier projection-slice theorem (FPS-SFT), which applies to multidimensional signals that are sparse in the frequency domain. FPS-SFT achieves sample complexity of O(K) and computational complexity of O(K K) for a multidimensional, K-sparse signal. While FPS-SFT considers the ideal scenario, i. e., exactly sparse data that contains on-grid frequencies, in this paper, by extending FPS-SFT into a robust version (RFPS-SFT), we emphasize on addressing noisy signals that contain off-grid frequencies; such signals arise from radar applications. This is achieved by employing a windowing technique and a voting-based frequency decoding procedure; the former reduces the frequency leakage of the off-grid frequencies below the noise level to preserve the sparsity of the signal, while the latter significantly lowers the frequency localization error stemming from the noise. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated both theoretically and numerically...|$|R
