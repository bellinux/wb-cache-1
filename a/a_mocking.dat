5|$|Jocelin {{was one of}} {{the main}} advisors of King John during the dispute with the pope over Stephen Langton's {{appointment}} to the Archbishopric of Canterbury. Jocelin did not immediately leave England after Pope Innocent III placed an interdict on England. Jocelin encouraged John to settle with Innocent in early 1209, worried that Innocent would expand the interdict into an excommunication, forcing John's advisors to choose between serving the king or obeying the pope. Nothing came of the negotiations, however. Jocelin did leave England when John was excommunicated in late 1209. Jocelin, along with Gilbert Glanvill, the Bishop of Rochester, was the subject of <b>a</b> <b>mocking</b> song on his conduct during the interdict.|$|E
5|$|The All Blacks {{perform a}} haka (Māori challenge) before each {{international}} match. The haka has been {{closely associated with}} New Zealand rugby ever since a tour of Australia and the United Kingdom by the 1888–89 New Zealand Native football team, though the New Zealand team that toured New South Wales in 1884 may also have performed a haka. The New Zealand native team that toured Britain in 1888 and 1889 used Ake Ake Kia Kaha, and the 1903 team in Australia used <b>a</b> <b>mocking</b> haka, Tupoto koe, Kangaru!. The 1905 All Blacks began the tradition of using Ka Matea haka composed in the 19th century by Ngāti Toa leader Te Rauparaha. The 1924 All Blacks used a specially composed haka Ko Niu Tireni, but later All Blacks reverted to Ka Mate.|$|E

On May 31, a jury found Louise Peete guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced her to death. While her sentence was being read, Peete sat in the courtroom reading The Importance of Living, a Chinese philosophy book by Lin Yutang. She looked up briefly to make <b>a</b> <b>mocking</b> facial expression to the prosecutor and then resumed reading.|$|E
25|$|In 1868, 20,000 spectators {{gathered}} at The Oval {{for the first}} game of the 1868 Aboriginal cricket tour of England, the first tour of England by any foreign side. Thanks to C.W. Alcock, the Secretary of Surrey from 1872 to 1907, the first Test match in England was played at The Oval in 1880 between England and Australia. The Oval, thereby, became the second ground to stage a Test, after Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). In 1882, Australia won the Test by seven runs within two days. The Sporting Times printed <b>a</b> <b>mocking</b> obituary notice for English cricket, which led to the creation of the Ashes trophy, which is still contested whenever England plays Australia. The first Test double century was scored at The Oval in 1884 by Australia's Billy Murdoch.|$|E

25|$|On 30 December, York and {{his forces}} sortied from Sandal Castle. Their reasons {{for doing so}} are not clear; they were {{variously}} {{claimed to be a}} result of deception by the Lancastrian forces, or treachery by northern lords who York mistakenly believed to be his allies, or simple rashness on York's part. The larger Lancastrian force destroyed York's army in the resulting Battle of Wakefield. York was killed in the battle. The precise nature of his end was variously reported; he was either unhorsed, wounded and died fighting to the death or captured, given <b>a</b> <b>mocking</b> crown of bulrushes and then beheaded. Edmund of Rutland was intercepted as he tried to flee and was executed, possibly by John Clifford, 9th Baron Clifford, in revenge for the death of his own father at the First Battle of St Albans. Salisbury escaped, but was captured and executed the following night.|$|E

Unlike the Pre-Crisis version, Lena is well-aware of history with Lex, having grown up {{alongside}} him, with only an abusive father. Lex and Lena's mother is named Letitia and is presumed deceased. She has no empathic abilities, and is a paraplegic with a teenaged daughter, Lori, both of whom still live in Smallville. Unlike his pre-Crisis version, Lex has little love for his sister, having abandoned her with an unnamed aunt after their father dies of a heart attack. Lex even {{goes so far as to}} cure Lena's illness, and then immediately undoes the process, leaving her completely catatonic, solely in order to make <b>a</b> <b>mocking</b> point to Superboy and Superman. Lena is currently under the care of the best doctors from Wayne Enterprises, hired by Red Robin.|$|E

She was {{declared}} the runner-up of season 3 on day 82 and won $50,000, losing to Lisa Donahue in a 9-1 vote. This result sparked and still sparks much criticism from BB fans who felt that Danielle lost the game purely on her entries in the Diary Room, where she often spoke about her fellow houseguests in <b>a</b> <b>mocking</b> and critical manner. The following season, the jury house was introduced, {{as a result of}} Danielle's loss. Early on in the game, Danielle teamed up with Jason in a strong but very secretive alliance. The alliance almost took them to the final 2, but they failed to win the final Head of Household prompting Lisa to evict Jason. Jason was Danielle's only vote in the final. In 2006, Danielle accepted an offer to appear on Big Brother 7: All Stars, where she claimed she was seeking redemption for her Big Brother 3 loss.|$|E

25|$|Reconciling with Lizaveta Prokofyevna, the Prince {{visits the}} Yepanchins at their dacha. He is {{beginning}} {{to fall in love}} with Aglaya, and she likewise appears to be fascinated by him, though she often mocks or angrily reproaches him for his naiveté and excessive humility. Myshkin joins Lizaveta Prokofyevna, her daughters and Yevgeny Pavlovich for a walk to the park to hear the music. While listening to the high-spirited conversation and watching Aglaya in a kind of daze, he notices Rogozhin and Nastassya Filippovna in the crowd. Nastassya Filippovna again addresses herself to Yevgeny Pavlovich, and in the same jolly tone as before loudly informs him that his uncle—a wealthy and respected old man from whom he is expecting a large inheritance—has shot himself and that a huge sum of government money is missing. Yevgeny Pavlovich stares at her in shock as Lizaveta Prokofyevna makes a hurried exit with her daughters. Nastassya Filippovna hears an officer friend of Yevgeny Pavlovich suggest that a whip is needed for women like her, and she responds by grabbing a riding-whip from a bystander and striking the officer across the face with it. He tries to attack her but Myshkin restrains him, for which he is violently pushed. Rogozhin, after making <b>a</b> <b>mocking</b> comment to the officer, leads Nastassya Filippovna away. The officer recovers his composure, addresses himself to Myshkin, politely confirms his name, and leaves.|$|E

500|$|Once Norreis {{reached the}} king he was {{converted}} to Baldwin's side, {{perhaps because of}} the latter's appointment of Norreis as the cellarer of Christ Church while the pair were at the king's court. The monks resisted this appointment, and in September they appealed to the papacy, arguing that the appointment was against the Benedictine Rule. They also captured and held Norreis in custody, telling anyone who enquired after him that he was sick. Norreis escaped in early 1188 by travelling through the sewer and fled to the safety of the archbishop, who was then at Otford. In <b>a</b> <b>mocking</b> reference to his escape route, Norreis was occasionally known as Roger Cloacarius or [...] "Roger the Drain-Cleaner". Baldwin then tried to have Norreis installed as prior at Christ Church's dependent priory of St Martin's, Dover, but the appointment was never confirmed.|$|E

It is no different than a person wearing a Cross or 'Taking Up the Cross' as it says in the Bible. My performance is neither anti-Christian, sacrilegious or blasphemous.
