5000|$|Traumatic neuroma follows {{different}} forms of nerve injury (often {{as a result of}} surgery). They occur at the end of injured nerve fibres as a form of ineffective, unregulated nerve regeneration; it occurs most commonly near a scar, either superficially (skin, subcutaneous fat) or deep (e.g., after a cholecystectomy). They are often very painful. Synonyms include scar neuroma, <b>amputation</b> <b>neuroma,</b> or pseudoneuroma.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Nerve {{tumors of the}} {{clitoris}} {{and particularly}} neuromas are extremely rare. CASE: A 27 -year-old infibulated African woman suffering from chronic vulvar pain increasing with sexual intercourse presented for gynecologic care. Examination revealed a painful clitoral tumor. The tumor was surgically excised. The diagnosis of <b>amputation</b> <b>neuroma</b> of the clitoris was made by microscopic examination. CONCLUSION: This is the first well-documented case of clitoral <b>amputation</b> <b>neuroma</b> occurring after female genital cutting. Considering {{the high number of}} genital cuttings practiced, these tumors are probably under-reported in the literature. © 2003 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

40|$|Introduction: Cholecystectomy {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} done procedures in general surgery. There are few reports of amputation neuromas following this procedure. This presentation describes a case of obstructive jaundice due to <b>amputation</b> <b>neuroma</b> in a patient with a history of cholecystectomy. Case presentation: We report about a 53 y o lady who presented with obstructive jaundice, 8 years following open cholecystectomy. Paraclinical investigations were in favor of cholangicarcinoma, however the final pathology revealed an <b>amputation</b> <b>neuroma</b> of the CBD. Discussion: Amputation neuromas are rarely seen in the era of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. They are benign reparative lesions of the CBD following surgery or manipulation of the extra hepatic biliary tree. It is very difficult to diagnose them pre-operatively. Surgical resection is the first choice of treatment. Conclusion: Traumatic neuromas should always be among the differential diagnosis, when assessing a CBD mass in patients with a previous history of open cholecystectomy or surgery to the gastrointestinal tract...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Amputation neuromas {{typically}} {{arise in}} injured peripheral nerves; rarely, however, they {{arise in the}} spinal cord. We report a rare case of intramedullary <b>amputation</b> <b>neuroma</b> associated with ependymoma in the cervical spinal cord. A 73 -year-old woman presented with a 5 -year history of progressive gait disturbance. Neurological examination revealed complete motor deficit of her hands and legs. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine revealed an enhancing mass within the spinal cord at the C 6 / 7 level. The patient underwent C 5 –C 7 laminectomy surgery. During resection of the spinal tumor, we found a whitish string resembling an aberrant nerve root or schwannoma with adhesion to the tumor on the ventral side of the spinal cord. After resecting the tumor, the surgical specimen was cut and separated into a soft greyish tumor (spinal tumor) and the tough whitish string. Histopatholo-gical and immunohistochemical examination revealed the former was a spinal ependymoma and the latter was a neuroma. An intramedullary <b>amputation</b> <b>neuroma</b> associ-ated with a spinal ependymoma is rare, {{and this is the}} first known case in which intraoprerative findings were clearly shown. Neurosurgeons should be aware that spinal ependymomas might coexist with neuromas...|$|E
40|$|Traumatic transection of a {{peripheral}} nerve is inherently {{associated with the}} development of neuroma {{at the end of the}} proximal stump, often leading to therapy-resistant pain. This study was designed to evaluate whether the neodymium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser could prevent neuroma formation after neurectomy. The sciatic nerves of 14 rats were diffuse coagulated by defocused Nd:YAG laser (12 W power), and subsequently transected with additional focused laser energy. The control group consisted of contralateral nerves transected by microscissors. The nerves were reexposed at different time intervals up to 9 weeks after surgery, and evaluation consisted of macroscopy, and light and transmission electron microscopy. True neuroma formation could not be observed after laser transection, and only five nerves formed a neuromatous bulb, with minimal adhesions to surrounding tissue. Microscissor transection resulted in widespread <b>amputation</b> <b>neuromas,</b> consisting of regenerating axons and connective tissue, and nervous tissue regenerating into surrounding tissue. Laser-transected nerves showed degenerative changes of the axons and myelin, while proliferation of Schwann cells could not be observed. No outgrowth of axons could be observed outside the coagulated proximal stump. An epi/perineurial layer was present, covering the nerve stumps. Microscissor-transected nerves showed proliferation of fibroblasts and Schwann cells, forming minifascicles, and vigorous outgrowth of axons into the tissue and even into the distal nerve stump. Within the limitations of this study it is concluded that the formation of <b>amputation</b> <b>neuromas</b> is suppressed by Nd:YAG laser application by thermal coagulation of the nerve and suppression of Schwann-cell proliferatio...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{present and}} discuss the {{occurrence}} of a traumatic neuroma subsequent to inferomedial orbital decompression surgery in Graves' orbitopathy. METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: Approximately 1 month after surgery, a patient who underwent bilateral rehabilitative inferomedial orbital decompression developed a mass with clinical and radiologic characteristics compatible with a traumatic neuroma of the left infraorbital nerve. The lesion, which {{was thought to be}} the result of unnoticed nerve trauma at the time of surgical dissection of the infraorbital canal, remained stable in shape and other imaging characteristics during the 39 -month follow-up period. Symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia could be only partially controlled with medical therapy (oral pregabalin 75 mg 3 times daily). CONCLUSIONS: The second branch of the trigeminal nerve may be damaged in the course of orbital floor removal decompression for Graves' orbitopathy. This may potentially induce the formation of traumatic or <b>amputation</b> <b>neuromas.</b> Such lesions should be included in the potential complications of decompressions when counseling patients about to undergo this type of surgery, as they are difficult to treat and may cause persistent and disabling pai...|$|R
40|$|Traumatic or <b>amputation</b> <b>neuromas</b> are neoformations {{developing}} after {{damage to}} a peripheral nerve. They are not proper tumors but rather a reactive process or a frustrated attempt of nerve regeneration. Traumatic neuromas are potentially found in every sensory peripheral nerve and often {{at the site of}} past surgical intervention, including orbital surgery. A 29 -year-old Northern African migrant presented progressive exophthalmos and progressive loss of acuity in left eye, which had started about 6 months before after a cranio-facial trauma caused by a violent assault. MRI of the orbits showed a massive intra-orbital, intra-conical lesion, clearly compressing and dislocating the optic nerve and extending posteriorly to the orbital apex. Surgery was performed through lateral approach of Kroenlein and led to complete excision of the lesion. Histology revealed fibrotic, adipose and striated muscle tissues, a disordered, non-neoplastic overgrowth of small and large fascicles of nerves, inflammatory infiltrates, and fibrosis with sparse calcifications were diffusely observed in a background of fat, scar and striated muscle tissued. Patient was discharged on the fifth day in good health condition, without deficit of eye motion but without recovery of visual acuity. In conclusion, this case demonstrates that traumatic neuromas may arise in the orbit in patients with minor direct trauma to nerves and without previous surgical treatment...|$|R
40|$|Autotomy is a {{phenomenon}} of deafferentation of the rat limb by transection of the sciatic and saphenous nerves, inducing an automutilation of the limb {{as a response to}} painful stimuli generated from the <b>amputation</b> <b>neuroma.</b> Autotomy has been proposed as an experimental model for neuralgia pain. The present study was designed to investigate the influence of streptomycin, ampicillin and chloramphenicol applied either {{in the vicinity of the}} nerve stump or intramuscularly. The course of autotomy was followed during 8 weeks using the scoring system of Wall et al. (1979). It was shown that streptomycin and ampicillin can suppress autotomy when applied topically whereas systemic use of the investigated antibiotics was efficient only when streptomycin was injected.

40|$|A {{traumatic}} neuroma of the biliary tract, {{most commonly}} {{has been described}} as an <b>amputation</b> <b>neuroma</b> in the cystic duct stump after cholecystectomy.

Three patients who had undergone a reconstructive procedure following accidental injury of the biliary tract during cholecystectomy are described. After many years they presented with jaundice due to an obstructive traumatic neuroma in the common hepatic duct (one patient) and in a previous biliary-digestive anastomosis (two patients). Eighteen cases of traumatic neuroma of the biliary tract causing obstructive jaundice, were found in the literature and analysed.

30|$|In recent years, IgG 4 -related sclerosing {{disease has}} become an {{increasingly}} intriguing clinicopathologic entity. The pathology involves diffuse or focal organ enlargement and mass-forming or thickening lesions, caused by heavy infiltration of IgG 4 -positive plasma cells and lymphocytes with fibrosis [10 – 12], in various organs, with resultant autoimmune pancreatitis, sclerosing cholangitis, cholecystitis, sialadenitis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, inflammatory aortic aneurysm, or inflammatory pseudotumors. However, the exact pathogenesis and pathophysiology of IgG 4 -related sclerosing disease remains unclear. As a malignancy is frequently suspected {{on the basis of}} clinical symptoms and radiologic findings in such cases, IgG 4 -related sclerosing disease should be included as a differential diagnosis. In the present case, diseases contributing to stenosis of the bile duct included cholangiocarcinoma, infiltration of the bile duct by gallbladder cancer, PSC, IgG 4 -related sclerosing disease, ischemic bile duct stenosis, and an <b>amputation</b> <b>neuroma.</b> In most cases, the diagnosis is easily established; however, a preoperative diagnosis is difficult to establish in a few patients.|$|E

The length of interval from the initial injury to presentation is widely variable. Diagnosis relies on clinical suspicion and accurate assessment, radiological imaging and, if indicated, surgical exploration.

40|$|Under normal conditions, the {{sympathetic}} neurotransmitter noradrenaline inhibits {{the production and}} release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, after peripheral nerve and tissue injury, pro-inflammatory cytokines appear to induce {{the expression of the}} alpha 1 A-adrenoceptor subtype on immune cells and perhaps also on other cells in the injured tissue. In turn, noradrenaline may act on up-regulated alpha 1 -adrenoceptors to increase the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin- 6. In addition, the release of inflammatory mediators and nerve growth factor from keratinocytes and other cells may augment the expression of alpha 1 -adrenoceptors on peripheral nerve fibers. Consequently, nociceptive afferents acquire an abnormal excitability to adrenergic agents, and inflammatory processes build. These mechanisms could {{contribute to the development of}} sympathetically maintained pain in conditions such as post-herpetic neuralgia, cutaneous <b>neuromas,</b> <b>amputation</b> stump pain and complex regional pain syndrome...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The forelimb amputee poses many {{reconstructive}} {{challenges in}} the clinical setting, {{and there is a}} paucity of established surgical models for study. To further elucidate the pathogenic process in <b>amputation</b> <b>neuroma</b> formation, we created a reproducible, well-tolerated rabbit forelimb amputation model. Methods Upon approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, 5 New Zealand White rabbits underwent left forelimb amputation. During this initial surgery, the median, radial and ulnar nerves were transected 1. 6 - 2. 5 (mean 2. 0) cm distal to the brachial plexus, transposed onto the anterior chest wall and preserved at length. Six weeks subsequent to the amputation, the distal 5 mm of each neuroma was excised, and the remaining stump underwent histomorphometric analysis. Results The nerve cross sectional areas increased by factors of 1. 99, 3. 17, and 2. 59 in the median (p = 0. 077), radial (p Conclusion Given that the surgical model appears well-tolerated by the rabbits and that patterns of morphologic change are consistent and reproducible, we are encouraged to further investigate the utility of this model in the pathogenesis of neuroma formation. </p...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To study {{possible}} causes of persistent pain {{in patients who}} underwent enucleation of the globe and in whom all other noninvasively detectable causes of pain had been ruled out. METHODS: Twenty patients were studied, 10 with intractable pain (score > 5 on a 0 -to- 9 self-reporting pain scale) persisting for more than 6 months after enucleation (for various reasons) and 10 without pain (score < 4) at least 6 months after enucleation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with dynamic color mapping (MRI-DCM) was used to quantify {{the motion of the}} optic nerve in millimeters per degree of gaze, 2 to 3 mm behind the implant. Histopathologic study of biopsy specimens was used to verify imaging findings. RESULTS: The optic nerve was attached to the implant in almost all (19 / 20) patients. On average, the motion was significantly less in patients with persistent intractable pain (0. 04 mm/deg) than in patients without pain (0. 08 mm/deg; normal orbit, 0. 13 mm/deg). A biopsy specimen was available in 5 of 10 patients with persistent pain, and in 4 of those 5, microscopic neuroma was found close to the optic nerve-implant junction. CONCLUSIONS: In the enucleated orbit, the optic nerve is usually attached to the implant and soft tissue motion is decreased. In patients who have persistent pain after enucleation, motion is decreased even more, and a high percentage of microscopic amputation neuromas are found. Increased stiffness of orbital soft tissue and optic nerve attachment after enucleation are detectable using MRI-DCM, and {{may play a role in}} susceptible patients in the development of microscopic <b>amputation</b> <b>neuroma</b> and pai...|$|E
40|$|The {{examination}} {{were carried}} out on 71 patients which below-knee/transtibial residual limbs, acquired in the growth period, which were regularly treated in Kharkov's prosthetic center from 1994 till 1998. The ratio of male to female patients was equal to 1, 4 : 1. The mean age during examination was 17, 5 years; the mean age to date of amputation 8 years. Predominantly were done the fasciomyoplasty (38 %), post- traumatic (67 %) amputations in the middle third of shank (65 %). The development after amputation by continued growth results very frequently in stump failure (2, 7 per one patient). The most frequent complication in the examined stumps during the growth was the terminal osseous overgrowth (55 %), treated by the patients, which were under 9 years of age during the amputation (76 %) and lost their shank in the distal third (74 %) for more than 10 years (74 %). The deviation of the stump axes in frontal (48 %) and saggital (16 %) 3 years after the primary <b>amputation.</b> <b>Neuroma</b> (4 %) developed just by the eldest group of patients.

Presently, PAP refractory to medical management is frequently treated with minimally invasive procedures guided by ultrasound, such as alcohol neurolysis and radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Objective: To record the immediate and long-term efficacy of alcohol neurolysis and RFA. We first used alcohol neurolysis and then, when necessary, we performed RFA on PAP patients. Study design: Prospective case series. Setting: Pain management center. Methods: Thirteen subjects were treated with ultrasound-guided procedures. Results: All patients were treated with neurolysis using alcohol solutions guided by ultrasound. Seven (54 %) of 13 subjects achieved pain relief after 1 – 3 alcohol injection treatments. The remaining 6 subjects obtained pain relief after receiving 2 administrations of ultrasound-guided RFA. After a 6 -month follow-up evaluation period, pain quantities were also assessed. Both stump pain (including intermittent sharp pain and continuous burning pain) and phantom pain were relieved. The frequency of intermittent sharp pain was decreased, and no complications were noted during the observation. Conclusion: The use of ultrasound guidance for alcohol injection and RFA of painful stump neuromas is a simple, radiation-free, safe, and effective procedure that provides sustained pain relief in PAP patients. In this case series, RFA was found to be an effective alternative to alcohol injection. Keywords: post-amputation pain, neuroma, ultrasound-guided, alcohol neurolysis, radiofrequency ablatio...|$|R
