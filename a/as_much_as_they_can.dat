25|$|Continuity {{theory is}} the view that in ageing people are {{inclined}} to maintain, <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can,</b> the same habits, personalities and styles of life that they have developed in earlier years. Continuity theory is Atchley's theory that individuals, in later life, make adaptations {{to enable them to}} gain a sense of continuity between {{the past and the present}} and the theory implies that this sense of continuity helps to contribute to well-being in later life. Disengagement theory, activity theory and continuity theory are social theories about ageing, though all may be products of their era rather than a valid, universal theory.|$|E
25|$|The {{citizens}} are {{shown to be}} a mixed bag. 98% are unemployed (due to advances in robotics) and range from lazy and sloth-like to highly rebellious violent criminals, bent on destroying and killing <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> for whatever reason they can think of at that time, if any. Most of the Judges seem to view them like a well-loved dim cat, stupid, greedy but with an unseen value that's worth protecting with everything they have. Although at times they've shown a huge lack of empathy towards them, such as when Chief Judge Francisco asked them if a large number that were on welfare could commit suicide in his Christmas message in order to help balance the budget for the following year. Some Judges openly view them as a nuisance to be removed, or like Judge Manners, as a sub-human race to be used and abused as the Judges see fit.|$|E

They come out to help fix the car <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> as Michael watches. Michael is visibly moved by their kindness and has a change of heart regarding giving the customer list to Wallace, but Dwight remains unmoved. Back at the office, Dwight tries to convince Michael he can't let his heart {{get in the way of}} business. Michael agrees to send the list and his information to Wallace, but then tries to escape and get rid of the list. Dwight chases Michael down and takes the list from him, causing Michael to finally give in. David Wallace calls Michael to congratulate him on getting the list. Michael then explains he is feeling a [...] "bittersweet" [...] moment over what he did to Prince Paper, bitter because he potentially ruined a decent family, but sweet because he satisfied Wallace.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{opens in}} the [...] "red reality" [...] (where Hannah {{is alive and}} Rex is not from the car accident), and Michael Britten (Jason Isaacs) is jogging around Los Angeles. When Michael gets home, he talks to his wife Hannah (Laura Allen), who is in Oregon looking at a university. Later in the [...] "green reality" [...] (where Rex is alive and Hannah is not), Michael and Rex (Dylan Minnette) are stuck in traffic, and Michael is later called into work. His partner in the [...] "green reality", Isaiah [...] "Bird" [...] Freeman (Steve Harris) talks to Michael, then Michael goes for {{a run at the}} Griffith Park. He goes {{to the top of a}} hill {{overlooking}} the city, while a dog appears from behind a bush and barks at him. Michael notices human flesh in him, and goes to investigate, where he finds a corpse sitting against a tree. Michael goes to the police station, and shows Captain Harper similar cases starting in 1999. In each case, a killer, nicknamed Gemini (Salvator Xuereb), vertically slashed the victim's wrists and carved a Roman numeral in their chests. The murders have taken place all across the United States, but everyone believes that Gemini is dead after an FBI agent Elizabeth Santoro (Megan Dodds) had shot him. Michael wants to cover the area <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> and Captain Tricia Harper (Laura Innes) agrees, telling Michael to pick up the profiler that the FBI has sent. Michael goes to Brentwood and meets with FBI agent Elizabeth Santoro. They discuss his history and she admits that she has been focused solely on the [...] "Gemini Killer" [...] for the last 12 years. Michael confirms that they did not find one on the body, so she figures that it is a copycat. Michael goes to the crime scene, while Bird is already there. The partners go over the hillside and find the dog. They take him to Dr. Banks (Chris McGarry) and have him check his stomach, where he finds a United States two-dollar bill in it. When Michael takes the evidence to Harper and Santoro, Santoro insists that it only means that someone with classified information to the case is involved. She suggests they check anyone who has recently laid off law enforcement officers with psych problems. Bird and Santoro create a database if the killer is alive. Santoro lets Harper decide and she tells the detectives to pull the files on law officers. As Santoro leaves, Michael approaches her and says that he understands the implications if the man she shot was Gemini. Meanwhile, the killer prepares a set of medical tools, a wad of two-dollar bills, and a syringe.|$|E
2500|$|Symptoms of {{dry mouth}} and dryness {{in the oral}} cavity are caused by the reduced {{production}} of saliva from the salivary glands (parotid gland, submandibular gland, and sublingual gland). To check the status of salivary glands {{and the production of}} saliva, a salivary flow-rate test is performed, in which the person is asked to spit <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> into a cup, and the resulting saliva sample is collected and weighed. This test's results can determine whether the salivary glands are functioning adequately. Not enough saliva produced could mean the person has SS. An alternative test is non-stimulated whole saliva flow collection, in which the person spits into a test tube every minute for 15 minutes. A resultant collection of less than [...] is considered a positive result.|$|E
2500|$|In August, {{after the}} Republican National Convention, Ronald Reagan gave a {{campaign}} {{speech at the}} annual Neshoba County Fair {{on the outskirts of}} Philadelphia, Mississippi, where three civil rights workers were murdered in 1964. He was the first presidential candidate ever to campaign at the fair. Reagan famously announced, [...] "Programs like education and others should be turned back to the states and local communities with the tax sources to fund them. I believe in states' rights. I believe in people doing <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> at the community level and the private level." [...] Reagan also stated, [...] "I believe we have distorted the balance of our government today by giving powers that were never intended to be given in the Constitution to that federal establishment." [...] He went on to promise to [...] "restore to states and local governments the power that properly belongs to them." [...] President Carter criticized Reagan for injecting [...] "hate and racism" [...] by the [...] "rebirth of code words like 'states' rights'".|$|E

2500|$|Dance {{competition}} {{had been}} a part of American television for decades before the premiere of So You Think You Can Dance, but usually in the form of all-around talent searches, (such as Star Search, Soul Train, or Showtime at the Apollo). [...] However, [...] a season-long American Idol-like talent-search show with a sole focus on dance had never been broadcast on American network television. [...] Producers and judges associated with the show have stated on numerous occasions, both {{within the context of the}} show and in interviews, that the series was meant to rejuvenate the visibility and appreciation of dance as an art form in the U.S. and to give exposure to struggling dancers. [...] Series judge Mary Murphy says, for example, [...] "Of course you hope you can make a living at it, because you don't want to give up on something that you do, but the honest truth is most dancers have to carry one or two jobs and dance <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> on the side -- it's a very lucky dancer who gets a full scholarship." [...] A number of dance-themed competition shows have been produced for American television since the premiere of So You Think You Can Dance, including America's Best Dance Crew, Superstars of Dance, and Live to Dance.|$|E
2500|$|Wengert's {{scholarship}} {{explored the}} politics {{of natural resources and}} environmental policy formation and administration, with emphases in national energy policy, urban water planning and management, land use planning and controls, national forest management, and citizen participation in administrative processes. At a time when environmental issues were nascent in the public consciousness, Wengert {{was one of the few}} political scientists applying their skills in this area. He achieved some early renown when his book Natural Resources and the Political Struggle which pioneered the revival of political economy in the United States found some popularity among scholars in 1955, but he is probably best known as coeditor and contributor of a timely anthology about the energy crisis that appeared coincidentally during the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973, published by the prestigious American Academy of Political and Social Science. Later in his career he advanced a seminal theory of the [...] "politics of getting" [...] in which he asserted: [...] "American politicians will get <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> for their constituents, with only casual attention to the merits of the case and to the extent that they are not likely to be held directly accountable for costs". This theory was accepted by others and extended into the study of international relations and comparative politics. Unafraid of courting controversy, he also published a research monograph that argued that the U.S. Forest Service had substituted its professional values for the legal requirements of their Organic Act of 1897 by allowing timber to be clearcut on the national forests for almost 80 years before they were authorized to do so by the National Forest Management Act of 1976. Overall, he authored more than fifty monographs and studies on the political economy and public administration of environmental resources.|$|E
