Actisol sprayer is considered to be suitable for the agriculture area (for instance, green houses) because it is small and portable in spite of a compressor in its system, and applies chemicals by dry treatment. It appears, additionaly, that Actisol sprayer may be used as an electrostatic sprayer because its output corresponds to very low volume or ultra low volume application...|$|E

40|$|The {{velocity}} of air generated by air-assisted crop sprayers {{is one of the}} parameters that determine the fate of pesticide droplets. If the velocity magnitude and direction are not properly adjusted, off target deposition causes severe environmental pollution and increases the cost of production. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model has been developed and used to investigate the effect of sprayer ground speed on the three dimensional (3 D) airflow patterns of a cross flow <b>air</b> <b>sprayer,</b> without considering crop interaction. Transient simulations based on a moving boundary condition were performed. The simulation was done for three tractor ground speeds (0, 6 and 10 km h(- 1)) and two fan rotational speeds (1360 and 1836 min(- 1)). Good agreement was found between measurements and simulations of transient velocity profiles as well as the vertical maximum jet velocity distribution at different distances from the jet outlet. Due to a large variation in magnitude and direction of the jet outlet velocity, the power-law maximum air jet velocity decay was not the same at every vertical position. Instead, a complex 3 D jet profile was established. The decay of the moving sprayer was best described with an inverse-linear relationship with normal distance from the jet outlet. The decay coefficient was linearly proportional to the ground speed to jet outlet velocity ratio, which ranged from 0 to 0 (.) 13. (c) 2005 Silsoe Research Institute.

40|$|Background] Chrysodeixis chalcites (Esper) {{is a major}} pest {{of tomato}} in Mediterranean {{countries}} and attacks banana in the Canary Islands (Spain). The efficacy of Chrysodeixis chalcites single nucleopolyhedrovirus (ChchSNPV-TF 1) was evaluated in plant growth chambers and greenhouse trials performed on tomato and banana plants respectively. Treatments were applied using a compressed <b>air</b> <b>sprayer.</b> [Results] Mean (± SE) lethal infection varied from 77 ± 10 % to 94 ± 3 % in second-instar larvae fed for 2 days on tomato plants treated with 2 × 10 to 5 × 10 virus occlusion bodies (OBs) L, increasing to ~ 100 % infection after 7 days. Mortality of larvae collected from banana at different intervals post-application varied from 54 ± 10 % to 96 ± 4 % in treatments involving 1 × 10 - 1 × 10 OBs L, whereas indoxacarb (Steward 30 % WG) and Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki (Biobit 16 % WP) treatments produced between 22 ± 6 % and 32 ± 5 % pest mortality. All treatments significantly reduced plant defoliation compared with untreated controls. Application of 1 × 10 OBs L was 3 - 4 -fold more effective than chemical or B. thuringiensis treatments. Larvae acquired lethal infection more rapidly when feeding on tomato than banana plants, but this difference disappeared following > 60 min of feeding. [Conclusion] This information should prove useful in the registration of ChchSNPV-TF 1 as a bioinsecticide in the Canary Islands and Europe.

A total of 20 experimental plots were established with 3 ft buffer zone between individual plots. The dimension of each experimental plot consists of 20 ft lengthx 10 ft width + 3 ft high on foundation wall (260 ft 2). Each treatment was replicated four times yielding 1040 ft 2.

40|$|In September and November 1996 Romanomermis iyengari Welch, a {{parasite}} of larval mosquitoes, {{was released in}} 44 natural larval habitat sites of Anopheles pseudopunctipennis Theobald {{in an attempt to}} reduce the larval populations of this important malaria vector. The selected treatment sites ranged in size from 5 to 500 m². The study was carried out in Pochutla District of Oaxaca State, on the Pacific coast of Mexico. Chemical pesticides to reduce vector populations have been the principal tool in malaria suppression campaigns. However, the excessive use of these chemicals has created pesticide resistance and other serious collateral problems. Therefore, a biological control project using agents that are pathogens of Anopheles larvae was initiated in 1996. The principal objective was to establish mass rearing capacities for R. iyengari. Detailed methodology for rearing and introducing these nematodes into mosquito larval habitats was established at the National Polytechnic Institute of Oaxaca State. Before application of the parasites to larval habitats, site characteristics were determined, including size, depth, aquatic vegetation, salinity, pH, conductivity, temperature, and pretreatment larval density. With a compressed <b>air</b> <b>sprayer,</b> infective mermithid parasites were released at rates of either 2000 or 3000 /m², and the parasites produced high levels of infection. Anopheles populations were sampled 72 h posttreatment, and the larvae obtained were taken to the laboratory and examined through microscopic dissection to determine infection levels and mean parasitism. Nematode parasitism ranged from 85 to 100 % at all the treatment sites, even though no previous information concerning field parasitism of An. pseudopunctipennis by R. iyengari has been reported. In addition, a significant reduction of mosquito larval density at the treatment sites was found five days after the nematode application. Levels of parasitism were indicative of the number of mosquito larvae killed by the treatment since infected larvae never progressed to the pupal stage. Results from sampling nine of the sites 2 months after the initial application of nematodes indicated that a high number of mosquito larvae were infected by parasites that had emerged from eggs previously deposited in the stratum. This work suggests the potential of this mermithid to reduce An. pseudopunctipennis populations in Oaxaca State...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research {{was to assess the}} outcomes on the spray patterns produced by the different feasible adjustments of two different <b>air</b> blast <b>sprayers</b> and one mist blower sprayer, commonly employed for treatments to Apulian "tendone" vineyards. The spray profiles of these machines and the respective refinements affected by the alteration of the available adjusting devices were evaluated using a test bench, suitably set up for calibrating the sprayers used inside such vines. The <b>air</b> blast <b>sprayers,</b> compared with the mist blower model, have a better chance to match the spray pattern and the canopy profile of the "tendone" vines. Furthermore, the left-right asymmetry of the spray profile is reduced only in the case of sprayers with two counter-rotating fans, under certain operating conditions. Conversely, the symmetry index worsens with the activation of the fan {{in the case of the}} <b>air</b> blast <b>sprayer</b> fitted with a single fan either with or without the air deflectors. The mist blower sprayer develops lower drawbacks, in terms of left-right asymmetry of the spray profile, even if the high "stiffness" of the spray profile makes this sprayer not particularly suitable to the changing needs of the canopy of the "tendone" vineyards.

Representative orchard and vineyard <b>air</b> blast <b>sprayers</b> in eight configurations (combination of two forward speeds, two air fan flow rates, and two nozzle types) were tested.

Muitos sÃo os fatores que influenciam na eficiÃncia de uma aplicaÃÃo de defensivos, porem grande parte dos produtores dÃo mais importÃncia ao produto aplicado que a forma como ele Ã aplicado. Definir o volume adequado de calda a ser aplicado na copa de culturas arbÃreas Ã uma tarefa difÃcil, devido a variabilidade existente entre os cultivos. O conceito de TRV (Tree Row Volume) surgiu como uma forma de adequar a quantidade de calda a ser aplicada em funÃÃo do volume da copa da cultura.

Os testes de perdas de corante e de calda para o solo foram conduzidos no delineamento de blocos, onde os tratamentos foram as oito taxas de aplicaÃÃo utilizados nos testes de deposiÃÃo na copa. A deposiÃÃo de calda na copa da cultura se deu de forma crescente a medida que se aumentou a taxa de aplicaÃÃo, apresentando uma maior concentraÃÃo na parte lateral da copa da cultura. Maiores valores de deposito de corante foram encontrados nos tratamentos com o pulverizador costal motorizado com regulador de vazÃo no nÃvel 6 e entre os nÃveis 3 e 4, nas aplicaÃÃes com o turboatomizador uma maior deposiÃÃo de corante foi encontrada nos tratamentos com 70 % e 55 % da taxa de aplicaÃÃo de referÃncia. As aplicaÃÃes com o turboatomizador apresentaram maior uniformidade de distribuiÃÃo de corante nos pontos de coleta em relaÃÃo aos equipamentos costal motorizado e costal manual. Maiores perdas de calda foram encontradas a medida que se aumentou a taxa de aplicaÃÃo, com exceÃÃo da aplicaÃÃo com o equipamento costal manual. Maiores perdas da corante foram encontradas nas aplicaÃÃes com o equipamento costal manual, seguido das aplicaÃÃes com o turboatomizador e com o pulverizador costal motorizado. As aplicaÃÃes com equipamento costal motorizado com regulador de vazÃo no nÃvel 6 e entre os nÃveis 3 e 4 se mostraram mais eficiente em depositar calda na cultura do cajueiro, para as aplicaÃÃes com o turboatomizador a taxa da aplicaÃÃo com 55 % da taxa da aplicaÃÃo de referÃncia se mostrou mais eficiente em depositar corante e com menores perdas.

Greater losses of the syrup as it increased the rate of application, with the exception of the application with knapsack equipment were found. Greater losses of dye were found in applications with manual knapsack equipment, followed by the <b>air</b> carrier <b>sprayer</b> applications and motorized knapsack sprayer. Applications with motorized knapsack equipment with flow regulator at level 6 and between levels 3 and 4 were more efficient in depositing the crop cashew dye, for applications with the <b>air</b> carrier <b>sprayer</b> application rate with 55 % of the rate of application of reference is more efficient in depositing dye and with smaller losses. It can be concluded that the deposition in the leaf and loss to the soil is greater the higher the rate, but the deposition of dye on the leaf is higher in motorized knapsack sprayer and more loss of dye to the ground occurs in the application equipment knapsack. t...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} relates about the {{structural}} {{characteristics of a}} trailed test bench prototype suitably designed for the adjustment of the sprayers used for expanded canopy fruit-growing. This test bench {{is equipped with a}} droplets intercepting patternator, that can be folded on the bottom of a road trailer during the transfers, through manually operated hydraulic systems. Furthermore the test bench is equipped with a computerized measure system realized by a measure bench, a computer and an ad hoc software. Preliminary tests of useful effectiveness were carried out with the still droplets intercepting patternator, through surveys of some fluid dynamic characteristics, very important for the evaluation of the transversal patterns of distribution produced by <b>air</b> assisted <b>sprayers</b> (air-convection or pneumatic sprayers). On the ground of the obtained results, the patternator is suitable for the evaluation of the transverse patterns of distribution produced by sprayers at present used for treatments to tree cultures 3. 5 m high...|$|R
40|$|Here {{we present}} {{the results of the}} first year of our {{research}} targeted at quantifying the landscape-level movement patterns of GWSS and its natural enemies. We showed that protein markers can be rapidly acquired and retained on insects for several weeks after marking directly in the field. Specifically, we sprayed a large citrus plot and a large olive tree plot with different inexpensive proteins using conventional <b>air</b> blast <b>sprayer.</b> In turn, insects that were hit by the protein solutions or that were exposed to marked plant tissue obtained enough protein to be detected by a protein-specific ELISA. Because the various protein specific ELISAs do not cross-react, we can apply the various proteins to different host plants in close proximity to one another. This marking technique provides the necessary tool to distinguish GWSS and its natural enemies so that studies of dispersal, migration, longevity, and density can be conducted. Additionally, different protein markers can be used to identify insect movement from different areas within a crop or from different crops...|$|R
40|$|ReportThe {{goals of}} this project were to {{identify}} equipment that maximizes spray coverage {{on the underside of}} leaves of cucurbits and to determine if powdery mildew can be controlled effectively with nonsystemic fungicides when coverage is maximized. Conventional nozzles and sprayers deliver little spray material to the underside of leaves. Thus systemic fungicides are currently essential for controlling powdery mildew in cucurbits. Fungicide resistance is a major concern because systemic fungicides are at-risk for resistance development due to their single-site mode of action and because the powdery mildew fungus has demonstrated high potential for developing resistance. Organic growers would also benefit from identification of a means to improve spray deposition as there are no systemic fungicides approved for organic production. The contact fungicide Bravo was applied using an <b>air</b> assist <b>sprayer</b> and using two novel nozzles (twin jet and air induction) and three traditional nozzles (flat fan, hollow cone, and cone jet) on a conventional boom. Parallel experiments were conducted on muskmelon and on pumpkin because these cucurbit crops have different canopies...|$|R
40|$|The EN 13790 and {{agricultural}} products certification standards stimulated the sprayers inspections in a yearly basis in Portugal. Since 2006 Centro Operativo e Tecnológico Hortofrutícola Nacional (COTHN) inspected almost 3000 sprayers throughout the all country, including field crops <b>sprayers,</b> <b>air</b> assisted <b>sprayers</b> for bush and tree crops {{and a few}} hand held sprayers for greenhouse crops. In 2009 and 2010, Ambi 3 Q and A. CANO began with sprayers inspections {{in the north and}} south of Portugal, respectively. The implementation of the article 8 of the European Directive CE 128 / 09 in all member states is an important step to minimize environmental impacts, protect human health and improve plant protection efficacy. However it is not an easy task due to the characteristics of agriculture and sprayers in use of each country. The actual legislation concerning the construction and inspection of sprayers was published in the last 3 years. According to the article 8 of the European Directive, the Official Service Direcção-Geral de Agricultura e Desenvolvimento Rural (DGADR) of the Agriculture Ministry, developed the Portuguese law Decreto-Lei n. º 86 / 2010 de 15 de Julho, in 2010, to impose that mounted sprayers, trailed sprayers and self-propelled sprayers must be inspected and approved before 26 November, 2016. The sprayers inspections carried out in Portugal should be an important tool to assess the sprayers in use and decide the best action plan to implement the article 8. Despite the sprayers inspections had been done mostly {{as a consequence of the}} European and National market rules, and so, the data collected are a rough sample of the real Portuguese situation, it is possible to observe that only one-third, of the sprayers inspected until now, have less than 5 years old. This means that the majority of the sprayers may not be in accordance with the standards and the article 8 of the European Directive...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Among the {{possible}} sources of environmental contamination by plant protection products, {{the use of}} <b>air</b> blast <b>sprayers</b> in orchards and vineyards can be very critical. The evaluation of the vertical distribution pattern is a crucial test to achieve a good quality of spray application. The aim of the paper was to compare {{the performance of a}} vertical lamel-late patternator versus a horizontal lamellate patternator. For this aim, an experimental device that allows the use of the same patternator, mounting the lamellae either horizontally or vertically, was utilized. The results showed that using the patternator with vertical lamellae a greater amount of liquid, 25 %, was collected than using the horizontal lamellae under the same test conditions. This amount represented the 36. 7 % of the total sprayed volume. The performance of patternator {{may be related to the}} reduced disturbance of the air flow induced by vertical lamellae. Although the amount of liquid col-lection is not considered the only parameter to assess the quality of a patternator, this characteristic can improve the effi-ciency of the test, especially when low volume orchard sprayers are tested...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} tree foliage on sprayer airflow through pear trees in a fruit orchard was studied and {{modelled}} in detail. A new three-dimensional (3 -D) {{computational fluid dynamics}} model that integrates the 3 -D canopy architecture with a local closure model to simulate {{the effect of the}} stem and branches and leaves of trees separately on airflow was developed. The model was validated with field observations made in an experimental orchard (pcfruit, Sint-Truiden, Belgium) in spring and summer 2008 and was used to investigate the airflow from three air-assisted orchard sprayers (Condor V, Duoprop and AirJet quatt). Velocity magnitudes were measured before and behind leafless and fully-leafed pear canopies across the row while the operating sprayers are passing along the row, and were compared with the simulations. The simulation results predicted the measured values well with all the local relative errors within 20 %. The effect of foliar density on airflow from the three <b>air</b> assisted <b>sprayers</b> was manifested by changing the magnitude and direction of the sprayers' air velocity behind the canopy, especially at the denser regions of the canopy and by changing the pattern of velocity decay horizontally along the jet. The developed methodology will also allow a thorough investigation of atmospheric airflow in canopy structures. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Wet {{scrubbers}} {{have found}} widespread use in cleaning contaminated gas streams {{because of their}} ability to remove particulates and based on the applications of scrubbing of marine engine exhaust gases by spraying sea-water. In order to examine the flow characteristics inside the scrubber, the model is designated with flow properties of hot <b>air</b> and water <b>sprayer.</b> The flow dynamics of evaporation of hot air by the injection of water droplets is the key factor considered in this paper. The flow behavior inside the scrubber was investigated from the previous works and to sum up the evaporation rate with respect to the concentration of water droplets are predicted to bring out the competent modelling. The numerical analysis using CFD facilitates in understanding the problem better and empathies the behavior of the model over its entire operating envelope...|$|R
40|$|Efficiency of {{different}} spraying lances and spraying volumes {{on the control}} of Brevipalpus phoenicis in coffee crops. The mite Brevipalpus phoenicis is found on coffee plantations in Brazil since the 1950 's. Responsible for indirect losses due to its role as vector of a virus disease, this mite species often requires control measures, the most common based on mitecide spraying. It was evaluated the mortality of B. phoenicis due the coverage of spraying liquid applied on coffee plants, with two types of lances used in <b>air</b> assisted <b>sprayers</b> and four spraying. volumes. Treatments were applied with mitecide abamectin (Vertimec 18 CE (R) at 0. 4 L per hectare), in volumes of 250, 400, 550 and 700 L per hectare, with two types of lances for the nozzles. The control efficiency against B. phoenicis, deposition and coverage by spray liquid on coffee plants was evaluated. Experimental delineation was in randomized blocks, with eight treatments plus a check plot in four replications. The statistical analysis was carried in a factorial scheme 2 x 4 + 1. No {{significant differences in the}} number of mites were found between treatments. As regards spraying liquid deposition, it was observed an increment with increasing spraying volumes, with the plant tops showing the best deposition of spraying liquid. The duplication of the lances (nozzle branches) resulted in a significant increase in control efficiency for B. phoenicis compared with conventional branch and with check plot, without dependence of spraying volume...|$|R
40|$|The {{strawberry}} crop shares {{some problems}} resulting from being horticultural crop cultivated on modelled and mulched lands, with narrow planting layouts, which reduce {{the types of}} machines available: hand held equipment (spray guns, spray booms, etc), or “cannon” distribution system. These sprayers produce both qualitative (uniform distribution of pesticide on and within the vegetation, ground losses) and quantitative (volume/ha; timeliness) problems. The aim {{of this paper is}} focused on the results of simulated treatment tests carried out in tunnels on strawberry crops with follow up analysis of the leaf deposits made using colorimetric techniques. Tests were made using the following hand held equipment: spray gun and two nozzle boom, connected with a hose to an hydraulic sprayer; furthermore an <b>air</b> assisted <b>sprayer</b> equipped with tangential cannon was used. Relating to hand held equipment, leaf deposits result from: a) the equipment characteristics and its positioning relative to target; b) operator velocity exchange during the treatment; c) position of the sampled leaves. Relating to cannon sprayers, leaf deposits show low capacity of penetration of the spray inside the vegetation and the need to adjust the length of the tunnel to the spray range. Finally, the ground losses are always higher than the leaf deposits, also in the case of localized treatments (carried out with the spray gun and the boom segment) owing to excess volumes/ha as regards to the effective needs of the cultivation...|$|R
40|$|Information {{is lacking}} on spray {{techniques}} to reduce off-target loss {{on the ground}} and via spray drift from the treated area in nursery applications. Airborne deposits at three elevations on sampling towers and on the ground at several distances from the sprayer were investigated with the three spray treatments in an open field without crops. Tests were conducted with an <b>air</b> blast <b>sprayer</b> equipped with conventional hollow cone nozzles (HC), low drift nozzles (AI), and conventional hollow cone nozzles with a drift retardant (HCDR) in an open field without crops. To compare field test results, wind tunnel experiments were conducted to assess spray deposits on the floor beyond 0. 4 m downwind distance from the nozzles and airborne deposits at 2. 1 m downwind from the spray discharge point with the three spray techniques. Droplet size distributions across spray patterns were measured with a laser particle/droplet image analysis system. There {{was no significant difference in}} airborne deposits for the three elevations at both 15 and 30 m downwind from the sprayer between AI and HC methods except for 3. 05 m elevation at the 15 m distance although the average airborne deposits with AI were lower than that with HC. The downwind spray deposits on the ground at 15 and 30 m from the sprayer with AI were higher than that with HC and HCDR. Compared with conventional hollow cone nozzles, drift reduction from air induction nozzles or the spray mixture with drift retardant was significant in wind tunnel tests but was not significant in field tests...|$|R
