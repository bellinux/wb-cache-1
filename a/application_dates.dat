50|$|A Field History Form {{should be}} {{completed}} before the planting season begins; farmers may not be available for a more thorough history prior to the season's start. This history {{is important because it}} acts as a reference when accurately diagnosing symptoms caused by pests, nutrient deficiencies and toxicities, chemical application, and unfavorable environmental conditions. This form should contain the following information: field location, farmer’s preferred field name or number, cropping history, including specific variety and seed manufacturer, planting date, planting rate (spacing), row width, tillage operations, crop yields, pesticide names, rates, <b>application</b> <b>dates</b> and who applied them, fertilizer and lime applications and rates, weather patterns, soil type, soil test records (N, P, K, percent organic matter, and pH), irrigation availability, major pest problems, and anything else that could make scouting more effective.

50|$|In 1995, Dana Innovations (Sonance) sued SpeakerCraft for {{infringement}} {{of patents}} on {{a method of}} retrofitting a wall to mount speakers. The speaker mounting system Sonance claimed to have patented was in fact largely invented by the SpeakerCraft partner Ken Humphreys as is evidenced by his name as an inventor. This invention is composed of a bracket attached by screws through the wall to the speaker support. The speaker is then wedged between the bar and the support surface in {{a hole in the}} wall, resulting in the speaker being flush-mounted to the wall. SpeakerCraft moved for a summary judgment of invalidity. The district court of California held that the patents were invalid because they were anticipated by an in-wall speaker offered by Boston Acoustics Inc. more than a year prior to the <b>application</b> <b>dates</b> of each patent. The U.S. Court of Appeals held that the patents were not anticipated by the Boston Acoustics product and reversed the district court’s decision and remanded the case for further proceedings. The circuit court affirmed the district court’s decision.|$|E

40|$|Field {{studies were}} {{established}} in Zavalla and Oliveros, Argentina, during four years in order to optimize Johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense (L.)

The effect of three <b>application</b> <b>dates</b> of postemergence herbicides was determined by visual control, density of tillers originated form rhizome bud regrowth, and from crown and shoot bud regrowth, and soybean yield. Following the thermal calendar model criterion, applications during the second date afforded the best control. Weed height for the first date showed little variability between experiments but was highly variable {{in the second and third}} <b>application</b> <b>dates,</b> achieving in some cases values greater than 120 cm. For all years, no significant differences were detected for crop yield between the first and second <b>application</b> <b>dates,</b> and yields were always lower for the third date. The greatest rhizome bud regrowth was observed for the earliest application date and the highest crown and shoot bud regrowth was determined for the last application date. Parameters associated with control efficiency showed the best behaviour for the second date. However, plant height at this moment may interfere with herbicide application and variability exhibited by this parameter highlights the risk of determining control timing using only one decision criterion. 199...|$|E
