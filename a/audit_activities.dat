The results of the study support that (1) internal <b>audit</b> <b>activities</b> have a significant intervening effect on the relationship between the scope of risk management and ACPQ, and (2) a direct and positive relationship exists between ethical environment and ACPQ.

Further, the results indicate that fostering a more ethical environment directly leads to higher ACPQ.
