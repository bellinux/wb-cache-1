40|$|A {{cryogenic}} cam {{butterfly valve}} has {{a body that}} includes an axially extending fluid conduit formed there through. A disc lug is connected to a back side of a valve disc and has a circular bore that receives and is larger than a cam of a cam shaft. The valve disc is rotatable for a quarter turn within the body about a lug axis that is offset from the shaft axis. <b>Actuating</b> the <b>cam</b> shaft in the closing rotational direction first causes the camming side of the cam of the cam shaft to rotate the disc lug and the valve disc a quarter turn from the open position to the closed position. Further <b>actuating</b> causes the <b>camming</b> side of the cam shaft to translate the valve disc into sealed contact with the valve seat. Opening rotational direction of the cam shaft reverses these motions...|$|R

50|$|Since their introduction, {{automatic}} washing machines {{have relied on}} electromechanical timers to sequence the washing and extraction process. Electromechanical timers consist {{of a series of}} cams on a common shaft driven by a small electric motor via a reduction gearbox.

40|$|The NASA Lunar Electric Rover (LER) {{has been}} {{developed}} at Johnson Space Center as a next generation mobility platform. Based upon a twelve wheel omni-directional chassis with active suspension the LER introduces a number of novel capabilities for lunar exploration in both manned and unmanned scenarios. Besides being the primary vehicle for astronauts on the lunar surface, LER will perform tasks such as lunar regolith handling (to include dozing, grading, and excavation), equipment transport, and science operations. In an effort to support these additional tasks a team at the Kennedy Space Center has produced a universal attachment interface for LER known as the Quick Attach. The Quick Attach is a compact system that has been retro-fitted {{to the rear of}} the LER giving it the ability to dock and undock on the fly with various implements. The Quick Attach utilizes a two stage docking approach; the first is a mechanical mate which aligns and latches a passive set of hooks on an implement with an <b>actuated</b> <b>cam</b> surface on LER. The mechanical stage is tolerant to misalignment between the implement and the LER during docking and once the implement is captured a preload is applied to ensure a positive lock. The second stage is an umbilical connection which consists of a dust resistant enclosure housing a compliant mechanism that is optionally actuated to mate electrical and fluid connections for suitable implements. The Quick Attach system was designed with the largest foreseen input loads considered including excavation operations and large mass utility attachments. The Quick Attach system was demonstrated at the Desert Research And Technology Studies (D-RA TS) field test in Flagstaff, AZ along with the lightweight dozer blade LANCE. The LANCE blade is the first implement to utilize the Quick Attach interface and demonstrated the tolerance, speed, and strength of the system in a lunar analog environment...|$|R
40|$|A {{latching}} mechanism {{in which there}} is linear movement and rotational movement is described. The umbilical doors of the space shuttle orbiter are required to be open during vehicle launch. After the external tank is released, the doors are closed. Presently, the device for maintaining the doors in an open position is mounted on the external tank and therefore has a single mission life. The {{latching mechanism}} of the invention is mounted in the orbiter and therefore is returned and has multimission capability. The latching mechanism is comprised of a pair of concentric nested, cylindrical cams and motors to <b>actuate</b> the <b>cams,</b> and latch pin all contained within a cover mounted on a support bracket carried by the substructure.

40|$|Ventilation Stack Continuous Air Monitor (CAM) Interlock System failure modes, failure {{frequencies}} and system availability {{have been evaluated}} for the RPP. The evaluation concludes that CAM availability {{is as high as}} assumed in the safety analysis and that the current routine system surveillance is adequate to maintain this availability. Further, requiring an alarm to <b>actuate</b> upon <b>CAM</b> failure is not necessary to maintain the availability credited in the safety analysis, nor is such an arrangement predicted to significantly improve system availability. However, if CAM failures were only detected by the 92 -day functional tests required in the Authorization Basis (AB), CAM availability would be much less than that credited in the safety analysis. Therefore it is recommended that the current surveillance practice of daily simple system checks, 30 -day source checks and 92 -day functional tests be continued in order to maintain CAM availability...|$|R
50|$|Drum brakes {{are also}} {{occasionally}} fitted as the parking (and emergency) brake {{even when the}} rear wheels use disc brakes as the main brakes. Many rear disc braking systems use a parking brake in which the piston in the caliper is <b>actuated</b> by a <b>cam</b> or screw. This compresses the pads against the rotor. However, this type of system becomes much more complicated when the rear disc brakes use fixed, multi-piston calipers. In this situation, a small drum is usually fitted within {{or as part of}} the brake disc. This type of brake is also known as a banksia brake.|$|R
5000|$|Until 2010 this {{engine was}} a dual {{overhead}} cam design with one <b>cam</b> <b>actuating</b> the injectors {{and the other}} the valve train. This injection system is known as HPI (high pressure injection) where the injectors are cam-actuated to create injection pressure. The fuel system uses an Integrated Fuel System Module (IFSM) with a lift pump, gear pump, pressure regulators, shutoff valve, metering and timing actuators to deliver fuel to the injectors. It has a one piece valve cover that is either plastic or on older models a chrome plated steel cover otherwise known as the Signature 600 or ISX CM570.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{cylinder}} bank {{had a single}} overhead <b>cam</b> <b>actuating</b> the poppet valves. The camshaft included two sets of cams, one for full takeoff power, and another for economical cruise. The pilot could select between the two settings, which would shift the camshaft along its axis to bring the other set of cams over the valve stems. Interestingly, the design mounted some of the accessories on the [...] "front side" [...] of the camshafts, namely two magnetos and four distributors. The seventh camshaft was not used in this fashion, its location {{on the front of}} the engine was used to feed oil to the propeller reduction gearing.|$|R
50|$|The engine {{initially}} displaced 379 cuin L, {{though the}} potential for larger displacements was engineered into the design. It had SOHCs actuating the valves via roller-tipped rockers mounted on rockershafts flanking the centrally located camshaft. Just like the FE Cammer, this allows splayed valves. It has a bore spacing of 4.53 inches, a stroke of 3.74 inches, a bore of 4.015 inches, and a deep-skirted thinwall casting block with cross-bolted mains. The 1950s-designed 390 FE had a bore spacing of 4.63 inches, a stroke of 3.78 inches, a bore of 4.05 inches, and a deep-skirted thinwall casting block. The SOHC version of the FE with cross-bolted maincaps, developed in 1965, had single overhead <b>cams</b> <b>actuating</b> the valves via roller-tipped rockers. A 427 cuin L version of the new Boss engine was put together and tested. It produced 700 hp.|$|R
40|$|The {{automotive}} {{brake system}} plays {{a significant role}} not only in the deceleration and stopping process, but also in many stability control strategies. To overcome the limitations of conventional brake systems and to improve vehicle control strategies such as traction control, and differential braking, a new generation of brake systems called the brake-by-wire system has been introduced to the vehicle industry. This generation of brake systems combines electrical, mechanical and, in some cases, hydraulic components. Although different types of brake-by-wire mechanisms have been developed in the past two decades, there still exist demands for further improvement and developing new brake mechanisms in the automotive industry due to the ever increasing demand for better safety and performance. This research proposes a novel brake-by-wire system based on cam actuation. This system is a combination of electrical, mechanical and hydraulic components. The unique feature of the cam actuation brake system proposed in this research is that the characteristics of the motor torque amplification can be optimized by careful design of the cam shape. The compactness and self-contained characteristic of the design allow the brake system to be installed on each wheel enabling fully independent control of each wheel for better stability control. Moreover, the <b>cam</b> <b>actuated</b> brake has a fail-safe advantage by keeping the direct connection between the driver and the brake calipers in case of any system failure. In this work, different subsystems of the brake system and their components are explained, the dynamic model of the system is found and the design parameters are optimized. Specifically, the optimal design problem has been formulated by taking the geometry of the cam as the optimization variable and the open-loop response time of the brake system as the objective function to be minimized. The solution to this problem is then obtained by the multi-layer design optimization process using the genetic algorithm (GA). Various control algorithms are applied to the developed <b>cam</b> <b>actuated</b> brake system to investigate their performance in terms of tracking a desired braking pressure...|$|R
5000|$|Nissan {{introduced}} its Variable Valve Event and Lift (VVEL) in 2007 as the world's second CVVL system. The first application {{was on the}} VQ37VHR V6 engine of Skyline Coupe (Infiniti G37). Nissan's system is more compact than BMW’s, involving fewer parts and less energy loss, and is therefore more adaptable to high-performance engines. [...] The VVEL does not use a conventional intake camshaft. Each valve is <b>actuated</b> by a <b>cam</b> which is pivoted on - but not fixed to - the camshaft. While conventional camshafts feature fixed rotating lobes, the cam in VVEL swings up and down; {{this is why it}} does not need a symmetric profile. Its movement is driven by the camshaft via a series of components. VVEL varies valve lift by the eccentric control shaft inside the rocker arm. By rotating the eccentric control shaft, the position of rocker arm is shifted, changing the swing angle of cam. The swing angle of cam determines the degree of valve lift.|$|R
5000|$|The SG 540 is an air-cooled, gas-operated, {{selective}} fire {{assault rifle}} that fires from a closed bolt position. SIG designers used a long-stroke piston-driven action (with the recoil spring {{wrapped around the}} piston rod itself) and an adjustable gas regulator with three settings: [...] "0"—used to launch rifle grenades, [...] "1"—used in normal operating conditions and [...] "2"—used in extreme environmental conditions or {{in the presence of}} heavy fouling. The firearm is locked into battery by means of a rotating bolt which features two heavy steel locking lugs. The bolt head is rotated by a control cam riding in a helical guide slot machined into the bolt carrier. When a shot is fired, propellant gases from the barrel are fed into the gas cylinder located above the barrel and impart rearward pressure on the piston rod, which drives the bolt carrier back. After a certain amount of free travel built into the system to allow the projectile to depart the barrel, residual gas pressures in the bore drop to a safe level, allowing the breech to be opened. The cam slot in the bolt carrier proceeds to <b>actuate</b> the <b>camming</b> stud in the bolt, rotating the bolt head out of engagement with the locking abutments in the receiver. The spent cartridge casing is extracted by a claw extractor contained in the bolt assembly while a protrusion on one of the internal bolt carrier guide rails in the upper receiver acts as the fixed ejector, removing the casing through a port {{on the right side of}} the receiver housing.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe classical approach {{for the analysis}} of linkages has been to assume rigid elements during operation. As the operational speeds of mechanisms increase, this assumption creates larger errors in the analysis. Thus a better model of a machine that considers elastic deformations will aid in more efficient design as well as provide improved accuracy and performance. This thesis presents a simulation for the dynamic response of an elastic link model with three clearances. The simulation has been developed for an automobile, <b>cam</b> <b>actuated</b> valve train. The computer program is coded in FORTRAN IV, for an IBM- 360 computer and is included as a portion of this work. The capability to visually observe the dynamic action of the model is included by a graphic display routine.

5000|$|The 6G73 is a 24-valve SOHC {{design with}} two valves running off a single cam lobe on the exhaust valves using a forked rocker arm and each intake valve <b>actuated</b> with two <b>cam</b> lobes, {{with a smaller}} bore than the 3.0 liter {{version of the same}} block. Bore and stroke are 83.5 x 76 mm; it is a 60-degree V6 and weighs around 155 kg. The engine has {{low-profile}} cast aluminum heads which help it to fit into compact engine bays, while pent-roof combustion chambers increase efficiency and make room for four valves per cylinder, arranged in a cross-flow pattern with a [...] "tumble" [...] intake port for both strong breathing and low emissions. Spark plugs are centered in the combustion chambers. The intake valves are 33 mm in diameter while exhaust valves are 29 mm. It also {{should be noted that the}} SOHC 24 valve version of the 6g72 uses these same cylinder heads. A toothed timing belt is used. The output of 6G73 is 161 hp (122 kW; 163 PS) at 5,900 rpm with 221 Nm (163 lb-ft) of torque at 4,350 rpm.|$|R
