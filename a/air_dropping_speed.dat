50|$|For smoke-sized particles, a MERV 12 filter may {{function}} {{as well as}} a MERV 14 filter at half its rated air velocity (for smoke particles), and a MERV 14 may function like a MERV 12 at double its rated velocity. This is because smoke-sized particles depend on diffusion (Brownian motion) onto fibers as much as impaction, rather than completely on impaction like dust. A slower air speed gives diffusion more time for the particle to stick to the fiber or previously attached particles. Conversely, a higher filter speed may increase the collection of larger particles because impaction depends on the inertia of the particles. As a filter gets clogged from use, the fan <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> <b>drops</b> so that the effective CADR for smoke may actually rise rather than decrease, while the CADR for dust will be lower from the decrease in fan speed, especially because the particles fall out before they are filtered.|$|R

The seepage gradient of the upstream shell is very small, which will not cause adverse effect on the upstream dam slope stability. The free surface of the downstream dam shell rockfill body changes little, which will not cause adverse effect on the downstream of the dam slope stability.

40|$|Abstract. For long {{distance}} water transmission project, choose {{a more effective}} control method is very import for safety and decrease loss in the emergency status. In the past, the serial regulate gate method is adopted oftentimes. However, its disadvantages are obvious, such as lower efficiency and rapid <b>dropping</b> <b>speed</b> of water lever which easily lead to landslide. This paper proposes a synchronous regulating gates method for emergency control which ensures the flow of open channel can reach new status of uniform flow in shortest time. The results of simulation show the <b>dropping</b> <b>speed</b> of water level using synchronous regulation method is significantly smaller than serial regulation method. The total time requires significantly less than serial regulation method too...|$|R
