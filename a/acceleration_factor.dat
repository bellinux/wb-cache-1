40|$|International audienceDiffusion MRI {{measurements}} using hyperpolarized gases {{are generally}} acquired during patient breath hold, which yields {{a compromise between}} achievable image resolution, lung coverage and number of b-values. In this work, we propose a novel method that accelerates the acquisition of MR diffusion data by undersampling in both spatial and b-value dimensions, thanks to incorporating knowledge about the signal decay into the reconstruction (SIDER). SIDER is compared to total variation (TV) reconstruction by assessing their effect on both the recovery of ventilation images and estimated mean alveolar dimensions (MAD). Both methods are assessed by retrospectively undersampling diffusion datasets of normal volunteers and COPD patients (n= 8) for <b>acceleration</b> <b>factors</b> between x 2 and x 10. TV led to large errors and artefacts for <b>acceleration</b> <b>factors</b> equal or larger than x 5. SIDER improved TV, presenting lower errors and histograms of MAD closer to those obtained from fully sampled data for <b>accelerations</b> <b>factors</b> up to x 10. SIDER preserved image quality at all <b>acceleration</b> <b>factors</b> but images were slightly smoothed and some details were lost at x 10. In conclusion, we have developed and validated a novel compressed sensing method for lung MRI imaging and achieved high <b>acceleration</b> <b>factors,</b> {{which can be used}} {{to increase the amount of}} data acquired during a breath-hold. This methodology is expected to improve the accuracy of estimated lung microstructure dimensions and widen the possibilities of studying lung diseases with MRI...|$|R

This factor is increased by 0.02 each time a new EP is recorded, which means that every time a new EP is observed, it will make the <b>acceleration</b> <b>factor</b> go up.

To prevent it from getting too large, a maximum value for the <b>acceleration</b> <b>factor</b> is normally set to 0.20.

40|$|Recently, k-t FASTER (fMRI Accelerated in Space-time {{by means}} of Truncation of Effective Rank) was {{introduced}} for rank-constrained acceleration of fMRI data acquisition. Here we demonstrate improvements achieved through a hybrid three-dimensional radial-Cartesian sampling approach that allows posthoc selection of <b>acceleration</b> <b>factors,</b> as well as incorporation of coil sensitivity encoding in the reconstruction. The multicoil rank-constrained reconstruction used hard thresholding and shrinkage on matrix singular values of the space-time data matrix, using sensitivity encoding and the nonuniform Fast Fourier Transform to enforce data consistency in the multicoil non-Cartesian k-t domain. Variable <b>acceleration</b> <b>factors</b> were made possible using a radial increment based on the golden ratio. Both retrospective and prospectively under-sampled data {{were used to assess}} the fidelity of the enhancements to the k-t FASTER technique in resting and task-fMRI data. The improved k-t FASTER is capable of tailoring <b>acceleration</b> <b>factors</b> for recovery of different signal components, achieving up to R[*]=[*] 12. 5 acceleration in visual-motor task data. The enhancements reduce data matrix reconstruction errors even at much higher <b>acceleration</b> <b>factors</b> when compared directly with the original k-t FASTER approach. We have shown that k-t FASTER can be used to significantly accelerate fMRI data acquisition with little penalty to data quality.

40|$|Purpose: Compressed sensing methods with motion {{estimation}} and compensation techniques {{have been proposed}} for the reconstruction of accelerated dynamic MRI. However, artifacts that naturally arise in compressed sensing reconstruction procedures hinder the estimation of motion from reconstructed images, especially at high <b>acceleration</b> <b>factors.</b> This work introduces a robust groupwise non-rigid {{motion estimation}} technique applied to the compressed sensing reconstruction of dynamic cardiac cine MRI sequences. Theory and Methods: A spatio-temporal regularized, groupwise, non-rigid registration method based on a B-splines deformation model and a least squares metric is used to estimate and to compensate {{the movement of the}} heart in breath-hold cine acquisitions and to obtain a quasi-static sequence with highly sparse representation in temporally transformed domains.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Parallel imaging {{techniques}} like SENSE or GRAPPA are used routinely in clinical practice today and offer robust <b>acceleration</b> <b>factors</b> {{in the range}} of R= 2 to R= 4.

Several methods have been proposed to calculate g-factor maps for visualizing the strength of the local noise amplification [1]. Recently, novel iterative reconstruction techniques have been presented that promise high <b>acceleration</b> <b>factors</b> by sampling k-space incoherently, e. g. using Poisson disc schemes, and exploiting sparse representations of the object [2].

40|$|A {{number of}} {{reconstruction}} {{methods have been}} proposed recently for accelerated functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data collection. However, existing methods suffer {{with the challenge of}} greater artifacts at high <b>acceleration</b> <b>factors.</b> This paper addresses the issue of accelerating fMRI collection via undersampled k-space measurements combined with the proposed Double Temporal Sparsity based Reconstruction (DTSR) method with the l 1 -l 1 norm constraint. The robustness of the proposed DTSR method has been thoroughly evaluated both at the subject level and at the group level on real fMRI data. Results are presented at various <b>acceleration</b> <b>factors.</b> Quantitative analysis in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and other metrics, and qualitative analysis in terms of reproducibility of brain Resting State Networks (RSNs) demonstrate that the proposed method is accurate and robust. In addition, the proposed DTSR method preserves brain networks that are important for studying fMRI data. Compared to the existing accelerated fMRI reconstruction methods, the DTSR method shows promising potential with an improvement of 10 - 12 dB in PSNR with <b>acceleration</b> <b>factors</b> upto 3. 5. Simulation results on real data demonstrate that DTSR method can be used to acquire accelerated fMRI with accurate detection of RSNs.

The PV electrochemical degradation mechanisms in the two polarities are different: (1) degradation rates in the two polarities are of the same order of magnitude; (2) center tapped grounded arrays are a preferred system configuration to minimize electrochemical degradation. The use of thicker pottant layers and polymer substrate films to reduce equilibrium leakage current values is suggested.
