Having recovered from surgery, Bolt competed in the 4 × 100 metres relay of the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Not in peak form Bolt {{said that he was}} attending the Games for the fans and to show his progress since the injury. Bolt <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>teammates</b> won the 4 × 100 metres relay in 37.58 seconds – a Commonwealth Games record. This was the foremost competition of the year for Bolt, given no Olympics or World Championships in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Following the Rangers' defeat, he {{announced}} his retirement from the NHL on 4 May 2009, {{at the age of}} 35. Näslund had informed Rangers general manager Glen Sather, head coach John Tortorella, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>teammates</b> of his intention to retire prior to the team's playoff elimination. By announcing his retirement early in the off-season, Näslund forfeited a $2million buyout from the Rangers, which would have counted against the team's salary cap for the following season had he waited until he was formally bought out. Näslund retired from the NHL second among all-time Swedish players with 395 goals (behind Mats Sundin's 564; he retired the same year). His 869 points ranked fifth, while his 1,117 games played ranked fourth.|$|E

5|$|It {{was four}} years before Selänne {{returned}} to international play; he appeared in the 1996 World Championship and the 1996 World Cup of Hockey and averaged over one point per game in both tournaments as Finland finished fifth each time. At the 1998 Winter Olympics, Selänne finished with ten points in five games. He was the tournament's leading scorer on a Finnish team that he described in 2003 as the best he ever played on and {{the best in the}} tournament, but lost the semifinal, 7–4 to Russia. He suffered an abdominal muscle injury that prevented him from playing in the third place game, which Finland won 3–2 over Canada; Selänne <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>teammates</b> ended the tournament as the bronze medal winners.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the regular}} season began, Ruth was a star pitcher who was also {{dangerous}} at the plate. The team performed well, yet received almost no attention from the Baltimore press. A third major league, the Federal League, had begun play, and the local franchise, the Baltimore Terrapins, restored that city to the major leagues {{for the first time}} since 1902. Few fans visited Oriole Park, where Ruth <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>teammates</b> labored in relative obscurity. Ruth may have been offered a bonus and a larger salary to jump to the Terrapins; when rumors to that effect swept Baltimore, giving Ruth the most publicity he had experienced to date, a Terrapins official denied it, stating it was their policy not to sign players under contract to Dunn.|$|E
5|$|Sena {{has made}} several {{appearances}} outside the Eyeshield 21 anime and manga.

As the series' title character, Sena is playable in all Eyeshield 21 games. These usually feature the manga's original story, but Eyeshield 21: Devilbats Devildays features other storylines. In Eyeshield 21: Max Devil Power!, Sena can play for teams other than the Devil Bats. He also appears in the crossover games Jump Super Stars and Jump Ultimate Stars as a supporting character.|$|E

5|$|Before the 2009 AFL season, Selwood was {{appointed}} to the club's seven-man leadership group at just 20years of age. After the 2008 Grand Final loss ended Geelong's previous season, Selwood <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>teammates</b> began their 2009 campaign by capturing the pre-season NAB Cup {{for the second time in}} four years. Selwood's 33disposals, 11clearances, and 2goals earned him the Michael Tuck Medal as the player adjudged best afield in this final. In round five, Selwood made his 50th senior appearance, setting a new VFL/AFL record for the highest percentage of wins inside 50games. His involvement in 46victories set a winning percentage of 92 percent. In addition, Selwood's 50th appearance coincided with the club's own record-setting effort for the most successful 50game stretch in VFL/AFL history. Geelong had won 47 out of 50games—Selwood had been involved in 46—eclipsing Essendon's return of 46wins and 4losses during their dominant stretch during the 1999–2001 seasons.|$|E
5|$|In January 1971, with Bobby Moore, Brian Dear and Clyde Best, Greaves was {{involved}} in late-night drinking, against the wishes of manager Ron Greenwood, prior to an FA Cup tie away to Blackpool. On arriving in Blackpool, Greaves <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>teammates</b> had been informed {{by members of the}} press that the game, the following day, was unlikely to go ahead due to a frozen pitch and the likelihood of frost that night. Believing {{that there would be no}} game the following day, Greaves drank 12 lagers in a club owned by Brian London and did not return to the team hotel until 1.45am. In fact, the match went ahead and West Ham lost 4–0. Greaves claimed the defeat was not a result of the late night, the drinking or the frozen pitch, but because the West Ham team in which he was playing was not good enough. As a result, the players were fined and dropped by the club.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match, {{the team of}} the Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott Steiner) and The Smoking Gunns (Billy and Bart Gunn) faced the team of Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R.

Fatu and Bart Gunn entered the match, and Fatu <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>teammates</b> wore Bart down while {{preventing}} him from tagging in a partner. Billy Gunn fought DiBiase and controlled the match until DiBiase performed the Million Dollar Dream on Billy. DiBiase released the hold and gloated about his performance. This enabled Billy Gunn to surprise DiBiase with a small package pinfall to win the match. After the match, the teams continued to fight until the Steiners and Gunns cleared their opponents from the ring.|$|E

He gained {{his first full}} cap against Switzerland scoring twice in a 3-1 win at Hampden Park on 15 May 1946 At international level, Liddell played predominantly as an outside left, in competition with Scotland-based Lawrie Reilly and Willie Ormond. The Scottish Football Association (SFA) denied Liddell <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>teammates</b> {{the opportunity to participate}} in the 1950 World Cup, hosted by Brazil, because of an earlier decision not to sanction involvement as British Home Championship runners-up. The decision meant qualification depended on the final match against England on 25 May 1950, which Scotland lost 1-0 when joint-first needed only a draw. Despite pressure from players, the SFA maintained its position.|$|E
5|$|Moving {{up to the}} {{national}} junior team, Getzlaf made his first of two appearances at the World Junior Hockey Championship in 2004. He recorded six points in six games for a Canadian squad that scored 25 goals in its four round-robin games and surrendered only four {{en route to a}} gold medal showdown with the United States. With Canada leading 3–1 early in the third period of the final, both Getzlaf and Sidney Crosby failed to capitalize on opportunities to add an extra goal that may have sealed a victory. Instead, Canada surrendered the lead, and Getzlaf <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>teammates</b> were forced to settle for the silver medal after goaltender Marc-André Fleury accidentally sent a clearing pass off a teammate and into his own net for the game-winning goal.|$|E
5|$|On January 1, 2010, Parise {{was named}} to the 2010 Men's Olympic Hockey Team, and was later named as one of the team's {{alternate}} captains.

In the final against Canada, Parise scored a game-tying goal with 24 seconds left in the third period to send the game into overtime, although Parise <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>teammates</b> had to settle for the silver medal after a Sidney Crosby goal during overtime. For the tournament, Parise finished third in the tournament in scoring, and he {{was named to}} the Olympic All-Star team with countrymen Ryan Miller and Brian Rafalski. In 2014, Parise was again selected to represent his country at the Olympics, and was given the added responsibility of serving as team captain. Parise and the United States capped off their 2014 Olympic campaign with a 5–0 loss to Finland in the bronze medal game.|$|E

5|$|The 2004 World Cup of Hockey {{was played}} after Selänne's {{difficult}} NHL season with Colorado. For Selänne, the tournament was about recovering his joy at playing hockey.

Returning to the national team for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Selänne joined Jere Lehtinen and Saku Koivu on what The Hockey News called the best team Finland has ever produced. The Finns outscored their opposition 19–2 in the group stage, then defeated the United States and shut-out Russia in the semi-final.

5|$|The {{following}} season, Johnson was City's leading goalscorer with 25 {{goals as}} the club sought an immediate {{return to the}} top division. The race for promotion went to the final match, with Manchester City and Portsmouth both in contention for {{the second of the}} two promotion places. Johnson starred in a resounding City win, scoring a hat-trick in an 8–0 victory against Bradford City. The watching crowd believed the result to be sufficient for promotion, but Portsmouth's match had been delayed by 15 minutes and was still in progress. A late Portsmouth goal meant the final scoreline in their match was a 5–1 win, enough to give Portsmouth second place on goal average by a margin of one two-hundredth of a goal. Johnson <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>teammates</b> overcame the disappointment of the preceding season in 1927–28, winning the Second Division to return to the top flight. His Second Division winner's medal was to be the only honour Johnson won in his Manchester City career.
