5|$|In {{addition}} to the 16 living orders, there are 9 extinct orders and one superfamily known only from fossils. The relationship of these to living groups <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other is controversial. The extinct Arthropleuridea was long considered a distinct myriapod class, although work in the early 21st century established {{the group as a}} subclass of millipedes. Several living orders also appear in the fossil record. Below are two proposed arrangements of fossil millipede groups. Extinct groups are indicated with a dagger (†). The extinct order Zosterogrammida, a chilognath of uncertain position, is not shown.|$|E
5|$|It will {{be remembered}} that the Virginia was a novelty in naval architecture, wholly unlike any ship that ever floated; that her {{heaviest}} guns were equal novelties in ordnance; that her motive power and obedience to her helm were untried, and her officers and crew strangers, comparatively, to the ship <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other; and yet, under all these disadvantages, the dashing courage and consummate professional ability of Flag Officer Buchanan and his associates achieved the most remarkable victory which naval annals record.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Hiroshima, {{almost all of}} the buildings were of old-fashioned Japanese construction, consisting of timber or timber-framed buildings with timber walls (with or without plaster) and tile roofs. Many of the smaller industries and business establishments were also situated in buildings of timber or other materials not designed to withstand explosions. Nagasaki had been permitted to grow for many years without conforming to any definite city zoning plan; residences were erected adjacent to factory buildings <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other almost as closely as possible throughout the entire industrial valley. On the day of the bombing, an estimated 263,000 people were in Nagasaki, including 240,000 Japanese residents, 10,000 Korean residents, 2,500 conscripted Korean workers, 9,000 Japanese soldiers, 600 conscripted Chinese workers, and 400 Allied prisoners of war in a camp to the north of Nagasaki.|$|E

25|$|Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That in {{recognition}} of the gallantry of First Lieutenant Frank H. Newcomb, of the Revenue-Cutter Service, commanding the revenue cutter Hudson, his officers and the men of his command, for their intrepid and heroic gallantry in the action at Cardenas, Cuba, on the eleventh day of May, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, when the Hudson rescued the United States naval torpedo boat Winslow {{in the face of a}} most galling fire from the enemy's guns, the Winslow being disabled, her captain wounded, her only other officer and half her crew killed. The commander of the Hudson kept his vessel in the very center of the hottest fire of the action, although in constant danger of going ashore on account of the shallow water, until finally he got a line made fast to the Winslow and towed that vessel out of range of the enemy's guns. In commemoration of this signal act of heroism it is hereby enacted that the Secretary of the Treasury be authorized and directed to cause to be and to present to First Lieutenant Frank H. Newcomb, Revenue-Cutter Service, a gold medal, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> of his officers a silver medal, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> member of his crew a bronze medal.|$|E

25|$|When Yang and Mills {{proposed}} the theory, {{there was no}} candidate vector boson. J. J. Sakurai in 1960 predicted {{that there should be}} a massive vector boson which is coupled to isospin, and predicted that it would show universal couplings. The rho mesons were discovered a short time later, and were quickly identified as Sakurai's vector bosons. The couplings of the rho to the nucleons <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other were verified to be universal, as best as experiment could measure. The fact that the diagonal isospin current contains part of the electromagnetic current led to the prediction of rho-photon mixing and the concept of vector meson dominance, ideas which led to successful theoretical pictures of GeV-scale photon-nucleus scattering.|$|E

25|$|R. romandi, {{along with}} other swarm-founding wasps, can be quite {{aggressive}} during the swarming process. They are aggressive towards humans, non-nestmates, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other. Aggressiveness towards humans may result in stings, while aggressiveness towards other wasps involves biting of the body, legs or wings. Workers are more often the aggressors, while queens are more often the victims. In R. romandi, workers do not always act out against non-nestmates. If different colonies of R. romandi are introduced to each other during the absconding process, they will cluster together and relatively little violence is exhibited against non-nestmate queens at this stage. If a queen is introduced after new colony formation, however, she will be vigorously attacked. It has been hypothesized that this means that R. romandi workers test out different queens during the absconding process.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{she argues}} for an ethics based {{precisely}} on {{the limits of}} self-knowledge as the limits of responsibility itself. Any concept of responsibility which demands the full transparency of the self to itself, an entirely accountable self, necessarily does violence to the opacity which marks {{the constitution of the}} self it addresses. The scene of address by which responsibility is enabled is always already a relation between subjects who are variably opaque to themselves <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other. The ethics that Butler envisions is therefore one in which the responsible self knows the limits of its knowing, recognizes the limits of its capacity to give an account of itself to others, and respects those limits as symptomatically human. To take seriously one's opacity to oneself in ethical deliberation means then to critically interrogate the social world in which one comes to be human {{in the first place and}} which remains precisely that which one cannot know about oneself. In this way, Butler locates social and political critique at the core of ethical practice.|$|E
