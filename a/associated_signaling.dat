Some digital interfaces such as Channel <b>Associated</b> <b>Signaling</b> also use versions of E&M signaling.

The protein forms a heterodimer with a related family member that may interact at postsynaptic sites to form a multimeric scaffold for the clustering of receptors, ion channels, and <b>associated</b> <b>signaling</b> proteins. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been described but their full-length nature has yet to be completely determined.|$|E

25|$|Off Indicator: An {{illuminated}} off indication {{means the}} <b>associated</b> <b>signal</b> is showing a proceed aspect. These are mainly used at stations, {{for the benefit}} of the train-crew and platform staff. When the display is blank, it means that the <b>associated</b> <b>signal</b> is at danger. An illuminated indication CD (close doors) is an instruction to close the train's power-operated doors. An illuminated indication RA or R (right away) means that station duties are complete and the train may depart.|$|R
50|$|In Europe, SS7 links {{normally}} {{are directly}} connected between switching exchanges using F-links. This direct connection is called <b>associated</b> <b>signaling.</b> In North America, SS7 links are normally indirectly connected between switching exchanges using an intervening network of STPs. This indirect connection is called quasi-associated signaling, which reduces {{the number of}} SS7 links necessary to interconnect all switching exchanges and SCPs in an SS7 signaling network.|$|E
50|$|In practice, many US {{helicopters}} used {{in emergency}} services {{are equipped with}} radios that allow communications on nearly any conventional two-way radio system, {{so long as the}} aircrew know the frequency and <b>associated</b> <b>signaling</b> tones. The radios usually have presets, like a car's broadcast radio, that allow some channels to be configured ahead of need. There was no information in the Commission report suggesting NYPD helicopters had such a capability.|$|E
50|$|The {{situation}} in Europe {{and the rest}} of the world is different. A Primary Rate ISDN configurations uses E1 carriers, where each carrier has 32 timeslots. 30 of the timeslots are used to carry calls, one timeslot is used for synchronization, and one timeslot is used to carry the signaling channel. The line cards in switches designed for the E1 system already include processing for the signaling timeslot. As a result, Non-Facility <b>Associated</b> <b>Signaling</b> is rarely used with E-carrier.|$|E
40|$|Associative {{learning}} and memory are common activities in life, and their cellular infrastructures constitute {{the basis of}} cognitive processes. Although neuronal plasticity emerges after memory formation, basic units and their working principles for the storage and retrieval of <b>associated</b> <b>signals</b> remain to be revealed. Current reports indicate that associative memory cells, through their mutual synapse innervations among the co-activated sensory cortices, are recruited to fulfill the integration, storage and retrieval of multiple <b>associated</b> <b>signals,</b> and serve associative thinking and logical reasoning. In this review, we aim to summarize associative memory cells in their formation, features and functional impacts...|$|R

By December 2009 it had been demolished. The junction and <b>associated</b> <b>signalling</b> is now operated from Healey Mills PSB.|$|R
50|$|NFAS is a {{cost-cutting}} measure. Customers {{ordering a}} Primary Rate ISDN {{service will be}} charged for each signaling channel. Therefore an NFAS configuration can be cheaper than Facility <b>Associated</b> <b>Signaling,</b> due to historical reasons. North American switches such as the Lucent 5ESS, and the Nortel DMS-100 did not handle common channel signaling such as ISDN on the same line card that terminated the T1 circuit. So, the telephone company needs to buy and maintain a separate signaling card for every D channel.|$|E
50|$|For CCS signaling, {{messages}} of several bytes are transmitted through the 64 kbit/s channel {{provided by the}} TS16 of the frame, with these messages providing the signaling for all the channels in the frame. Each message contains information that determines the channel that is signaling. The signaling circuits access the 64 kbit/s channel of the TS16, and they are also common to all the channels signaled. There are different CCS systems that constitute complex protocols. In the following section and by way of example, channel <b>associated</b> <b>signaling</b> will be looked.|$|E
50|$|However, in the T-carrier systems {{used in the}} U.S. and Canada, a {{technique}} called bit-robbing uses, in every sixth frame, the least significant bit in the time slot associated with the voice channel for Channel <b>Associated</b> <b>Signaling</b> (CAS). This effectively renders the lowest bit of the 8 speech bits unusable for data transmission, and so a 56 kbit/s line used only 7 of the 8 data bits in each sample period to send data, thus giving a data rate of 8000 Hz × 7 bits = 56 kbit/s.|$|E

50|$|There are {{signals that}} {{indicate}} when a subscriber {{has picked up}} the telephone, {{when he or she}} can start to dial a number, and when another subscriber calls, as well as signals that let the communication link be maintained, and so on. In the E1 PCM system, signaling information can be transmitted by two different methods: the common channel signaling (CCS) method and the channel <b>associated</b> <b>signaling</b> (CAS) method. In both cases, the time slot TS16 of the basic 2 Mbit/s frame is used to transmit the signaling information.|$|E
5000|$|Integrins play an {{important}} role in cell signaling by modulating the cell signaling pathways of transmembrane protein kinases such as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK). While the interaction between integrin and receptor tyrosine kinases originally was thought of as uni-directional and supportive, recent studies indicate that integrins have additional, multi-faceted roles in cell signaling. Integrins can regulate the receptor tyrosine kinase signaling by recruiting specific adaptors to the plasma membrane. For example, β1c integrin recruits Gab1/Shp2 and presents Shp2 to IGF1R, resulting in dephosphorylation of the receptor. [...] In a reverse direction, when a receptor tyrosine kinase is activated, integrins co-localise at focal adhesion with the receptor tyrosine kinases and their <b>associated</b> <b>signaling</b> molecules.|$|E
50|$|PSD-95 is {{a member}} of the membrane-associated {{guanylate}} kinase (MAGUK) family. With PSD-93 it is recruited into the same NMDA receptor and potassium channel clusters. These two MAGUK proteins may interact at postsynaptic sites to form a multimeric scaffold for the clustering of receptors, ion channels, and <b>associated</b> <b>signaling</b> proteins. PSD-95 is the best studied member of the MAGUK-family of PDZ domain-containing proteins. Like all MAGUK-family proteins, its basic structure includes three PDZ domains, an SH3 domain, and a guanylate kinase-like domain (GK) connected by disordered linker regions. It is almost exclusively located in the post synaptic density of neurons, and is involved in anchoring synaptic proteins. Its direct and indirect binding partners include neuroligin, NMDA receptors, AMPA receptors, and potassium channels. It plays an important role in synaptic plasticity and the stabilization of synaptic changes during long-term potentiation.|$|E
