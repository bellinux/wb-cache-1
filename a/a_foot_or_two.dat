25|$|Attempts {{to fly the}} Cygnet II at Baddeck, Nova Scotia between 22 and 24 February 1909, {{met with}} failure. When the AEA Silver Dart was ready for flight testing, the engine {{was removed from the}} Cygnet II, and then returned. Rebuilt again as the Cygnet III with a more {{powerful}} 70hp Gnome Gamma engine, its final flight was on 19 March 1912, at Bras d'Or Lake, Nova Scotia, piloted by John McCurdy. The results were highly unsatisfactory with the Cygnet III only able to lift off the ground for <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> typically considered remaining in ground effect. After a final trial on 17 March, the tetrahedral cell bank failed structurally, leaving the aircraft irreparably damaged. The Cygnet II and III were abandoned following this flight attempt.|$|E
500|$|Scottish {{infantry}} {{were generally}} armed, as was almost universal in Western Europe, {{with a combination}} of pike and shot. Pikes were theoretically [...] long, but were often shortened by <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> to make them more manageable, this had disastrous consensuses at the Battle of Benburb (1646), where the Confederate Irish defeated the Scots because they possessed longer pikes. Musketeers were mainly armed with matchlock muskets, with some firelocks (probably mainly reserved for troops defending the baggage and ammunition) and there were a handful of troops that brought more accurate rifled guns. Continental experience tended to increasingly emphasise firepower over melee and this was reflected in the greater proportions of shot to pike, usually in proportions of three to two. Scottish armies may also have had individuals with weapons including bows, Lochaber axes, and halberds. as recruits who lacked pike and shot were told to report with these. Most cavalry were probably equipped with pistols and swords, although {{there is some evidence that}} they included lancers.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the last}} few decades, canoe racing has become popular among Coast Salish peoples. [...] It's done with {{specifically}} designed war canoes or racing canoes. [...] They {{are based on the}} more traditional canoe styles, but have quite a modern design. [...] The canoe is usually <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> above water level, with enough width for one man. [...] Different races include single, double, or 11-man races. [...] The races are held in the summertime.|$|E

60|$|His {{way back}} lay by the {{military}} gymnasium-ground. And there he passed the Corporal glibly instructing young soldiers how to swing themselves over rapid and deep watercourses {{on their way to}} Glory, by means of a rope, and himself deftly plunging off a platform, and flying <b>a</b> hundred <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> as <b>an</b> encouragement to them to begin. And there he also passed, perched on a crowning eminence (probably the Corporal's careful hands), the small Bebelle, with her round eyes wide open, surveying the proceeding like a wondering sort of blue and white bird.|$|R
50|$|For a {{single-ended}} HF antenna, a good {{electrical earth}} connection is essential. It {{is also necessary}} from the points of view of safety and EMC considerations on any radio transmitter installation on a boat or ship. As mentioned above, metal-hulled vessels have a natural advantage in that, especially at HF and lower frequencies, the hull can {{be considered to be}} in contact with the water, as the insulating properties of the paint layer against the water is a capacitance that presents very little electrical impedance to the RF currents. For fibreglass and wooden hulls and HF transmission, the usual solution is to attach a sintered bronze plate to the outside of the hull for RF earthing. The construction of a sintered bronze plate is porous to water so that although the plate may be only <b>a</b> square <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> and <b>an</b> inch thick, the actual surface area of metal in electrical contact with the water is very many times that.|$|R
2500|$|The {{doctor who}} {{examined}} Oughton's remains {{said that she}} had been standing within <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> of the bomb when it exploded. [...] It may, in fact, have gone off in her hands. [...] Ayers has raised the possibility that Oughton may have intentionally detonated the explosion, and {{it has been reported that}} a vicious argument occurred throughout the previous day and night in which Boudin favored using antipersonnel bombs, and that Oughton had misgivings.|$|E
2500|$|The four tallest {{buildings}} {{in the area are}} located in downtown Minneapolis. The first skyscraper built west of the Mississippi in 1929 was the Foshay Tower. Today there is some contention over exactly which building is the tallest—most Minnesotans would immediately think of the IDS Center if queried on the point, although most sources seem to agree that Capella Tower is slightly taller. But in early 2005, {{it was found that the}} IDS Center is taller by a [...] washroom garage on top, which brings its total height to 792 feet (241 m). Capella Tower and the Wells Fargo Center only differ in height by <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> a rather negligible amount.|$|E
2500|$|The {{geothermal}} {{areas of}} Yellowstone include several geyser basins in Yellowstone National Park {{as well as}} other geothermal features such as hot springs, mud pots, and fumaroles. The number of thermal features in Yellowstone is estimated at 10,000. [...] A study that was completed in 2011 found that a total of 1,283 geysers have erupted in Yellowstone, 465 of which are active during an average year. [...] These are distributed among nine geyser basins, with a few geysers found in smaller thermal areas throughout the Park. [...] The number of geysers in each geyser basin are as follows: Upper Geyser Basin (410), Midway Geyser Basin (59), Lower Geyser Basin (283), Norris Geyser Basin (193), West Thumb Geyser Basin (84), Gibbon Geyser Basin (24), Lone Star Geyser Basin (21), Shoshone Geyser Basin (107), Heart Lake Geyser Basin (69), other areas (33). [...] Although famous large geysers like Old Faithful are part of the total, most of Yellowstone's geysers are small, erupting to only <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> [...] The hydrothermal system that supplies the geysers with hot water sits within an ancient active caldera. [...] Many of the thermal features in Yellowstone build up sinter, geyserite, or travertine deposits around and within them.|$|E
25|$|Furious {{at being}} {{abandoned}} by his confederates, Workman {{had to make}} his way back to Brooklyn by <b>foot.</b> <b>A</b> day <b>or</b> <b>two</b> later Workman filed a 'grievance' with the board against Weiss and Schechter. Although he had simply followed Weiss' frantic orders to drive away without waiting for Workman, the unfortunate Schechter ended up bearing the punishment, becoming a Murder, Inc. victim himself a short time later. In 1944 Weiss ended up in the electric chair for another murder. Workman was eventually tried by the State of New Jersey for the Schultz murder and served 23 years in prison.|$|R
5000|$|The terms {{aerial view}} and aerial {{viewpoint}} are also sometimes used synonymous with bird's-eye view. The term aerial view {{can refer to}} any view from a great height, even at a wide angle, as for example when looking sideways from an airplane window or from a mountain top. Overhead view is fairly synonymous with bird's-eye view but tends to imply a less lofty vantage point than the latter term. For example, in computer and video games, an [...] "overhead view" [...] of a character or situation often places the vantage point only <b>a</b> few <b>feet</b> (<b>a</b> meter <b>or</b> <b>two)</b> above human height. See top-down perspective.|$|R
5000|$|... "La Diablesse", {{the devil}} woman, is {{sometimes}} personified {{as an old}} crone, who steps forth with her cloven hoof from behind a tree on a lonely road, the sound of chains mingling with the rustle of her petticoat. Sometimes she {{takes the form of}} a beautiful woman, to lure some unsuspecting passerby to his death or perhaps to madness. Although she may appear young, she will be dressed in the ancient costume of these islands: a brilliant madras turban, chemise with half sleeves and much embroidery and lace, zepingue tremblant ("trembling pins of gold"), and all the finery of the by-gone days. Even when she appears beautiful, there is something that betrays her - she often has one hoof and <b>a</b> normal human <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> hooves which she uses her long, flowing gown to hide.|$|R
2500|$|The Aerodium is a skydiving {{simulator}} {{wind tunnel}} invented in Germany in 1984. [...] In 1987, Action Park built and opened their own Aerodium in the Waterworld {{section of the}} park, becoming the first American amusement park to open an Aerodium. [...] The attraction was operated by Aerodium Inc, who would act as a concessionaire for the park through 1997. Stadium seating encircled {{the perimeter of the}} Aerodium, allowing friends and spectators to watch riders fly. Riders wearing a special skydiving suit, helmet, and earplugs would join the bodyflight instructor one by one on a trampoline-like netting directly over the fan. The instructor would grab each rider's wrists and guide the rider to fall forward, allowing the fan to lift the rider skyward. After a few seconds of flight, the attendant operating the fan would cut the power, causing the rider to fall onto the air cushions surrounding the fan. Park guests' flights were limited to a maximum of 6 or 7 feet (2 m) above the ground, approximately <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> over the instructor's head. The Aerodium also caused severe injuries, for example, when a rider instinctively tried to break his fall by extending his arm, which caused shoulder dislocation, severed nerves, and near-permanent paralysis of the arm.|$|E

60|$|But {{where was}} the warden, who was by office, {{as well as by}} courtesy, to have {{received}} us? He too had not expected us, and was gone home after his day's work to his new clearing inland: but a man had been sent on to him over the mountain; and over the mountain we must go, and on foot too, for the horses could do no more, and there was no stabling for them farther on. How far was the new clearing? Oh, perhaps a couple of miles--perhaps a league. And how high up? Oh, nothing--only <b>a</b> hundred <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> One knew what that meant; and, with a sigh, resigned oneself to a four or five miles' mountain walk {{at the end of a}} long day, and started up the steep zigzag, through cacao groves, past the loveliest gardens--I recollect in one an agave in flower, nigh thirty feet high, its spike all primrose and golden yellow in the fading sunlight--then up into rastrajo; and then into high wood, and a world of ferns--tree ferns, climbing ferns, and all other ferns which ever delighted the eye in an English hothouse. For along these northern slopes, sheltered from the sun for the greater part of the year, and for ever watered by the steam of the trade-wind, ferns are far more luxuriant and varied than in any other part of the island.|$|R
6000|$|But {{there the}} analogy stopped. It hardly applied even so far. [...] Between {{us and the}} rough dark-skirted {{wilderness}} of the high forests on Montserrat the infant frost had never trodden; all basked in the equal heat of the perpetual summer; awaiting, it may be, in ages to come, a civilisation higher even than that whose decay Shelley deplored as he looked down on fallen Italy. No clumsy words of mine can give an adequate picture of {{the beauty of the}} streams and glens which run down from either slope of the Northern Mountain. The reader must fancy for himself the loveliest brook which he ever saw in Devonshire or Yorkshire, Ireland or Scotland; crystal-clear, bedded with gray pebbles, broken into rapids by rock-ledges or great white quartz boulders, swirling under steep cliffs, winding through flats of natural meadow and copse. Then let him transport his stream into the great Palm-house at Kew, stretch out the house up hill and down dale, five miles in length and two thousand feet in height; pour down on it from above a blaze which lights up every leaf into a gem, and deepens every shadow into blackness, and yet that very blackness full of inner light--and if his fancy can do as much as that, he can imagine to himself the stream up which we rode or walked, now winding along the narrow track <b>a</b> hundred <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> above, looking down on the upper surface of the forest, on the crests of palms, and the broad sheets of the balisier copse, and often on the statelier fronds of true bananas, which had run wild along the stream-side, flowering and fruiting in the wilderness {{for the benefit of the}} parrots and agoutis; or on huge dark clumps of bamboo, which (probably not indigenous to the island) have in like manner spread themselves along all the streams in the lapse of ages.|$|R
60|$|Two steps {{took him}} up to the waist, and he had trouble in finding solid bottom at the next, because the gravel rolled and slipped away beneath his feet in the strong stream. The current also dragged hard at his limbs, and he set his lips tight when it crept up to his ribs. Then he lost his footing, and was washed away, {{plunging}} and floundering, with now and then one toe resting momentarily upon the bottom, until he was hurled against the first of the boulders with a crash that almost drove the little remaining breath out of his body. He clung to it desperately, gasping hard; and then with a determined struggle contrived to reach the second stone, against which the stream pressed him, without finding any support for his <b>feet.</b> <b>A</b> moment <b>or</b> <b>two</b> later, Vane was washed down towards him, and grabbing at the boulder held on by it. They said nothing to each other, but they looked at the sliding water between them and the opposite bank. Carroll was getting horribly cold, and felt the power ebbing out of him; he thought if he must swim across he had better do so at once.|$|R

60|$|But {{here the}} shop-bell rang; {{it was like}} a sound from a remote distance,--so far had Hepzibah descended into the sepulchral depths of her reminiscences. On {{entering}} the shop, she found an old man there, a humble resident of Pyncheon Street, and whom, for a great many years past, she had suffered {{to be a kind of}} familiar of the house. He was an immemorial personage, who seemed always to have had a white head and wrinkles, and never to have possessed but a single tooth, and that a half-decayed one, in the front of the upper jaw. Well advanced as Hepzibah was, she could not remember when Uncle Venner, as the neighborhood called him, had not gone up and down the street, stooping a little and drawing his feet heavily over the gravel or pavement. But still there was something tough and vigorous about him, that not only kept him in daily breath, but enabled him to fill a place which would else have been vacant in the apparently crowded world. To go of errands with his slow and shuffling gait, which made you doubt how he ever was to arrive anywhere; to saw <b>a</b> small household's <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> of firewood, <b>or</b> knock to pieces an old barrel, or split up a pine board for kindling-stuff; in summer, to dig the few yards of garden ground appertaining to a low-rented tenement, and share the produce of his labor at the halves; in winter, to shovel away the snow from the sidewalk, or open paths to the woodshed, or along the clothes-line; such were some of the essential offices which Uncle Venner performed among at least a score of families. Within that circle, he claimed the same sort of privilege, and probably felt as much warmth of interest, as a clergyman does in the range of his parishioners. Not that he laid claim to the tithe pig; but, as an analogous mode of reverence, he went his rounds, every morning, to gather up the crumbs of the table and overflowings of the dinner-pot, as food for a pig of his own.|$|R
60|$|WHERE and WHEN are {{questions}} belonging to all finite existences, and are by us always reckoned from some known {{parts of this}} sensible world, and from some certain epochs marked out {{to us by the}} motions observable in it. Without some such fixed parts or periods, the order of things would be lost, to our finite understandings, in the boundless invariable oceans of duration and expansion, which comprehend in them all finite beings, and in their full extent belong only to the Deity. And therefore we are not to wonder that we comprehend them not, and do so often find our thoughts at a loss, when we would consider them, either abstractly in themselves, or as any way attributed to the first incomprehensible Being. But when applied to any particular finite beings, the extension of any body is so much of that infinite space as the bulk of the body takes up. And place is the position of any body, when considered at a certain distance from some other. As the idea of the particular duration of anything is, an idea of that portion of infinite duration which passes during the existence of that thing; so the time when the thing existed is, the idea of that space of duration which passed between some known and fixed period of duration, and the being of that thing. One shows the distance of the extremities of the bulk or existence of the same thing, as that it is <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> square, <b>or</b> lasted <b>two</b> years; the other shows the distance of it in place, or existence from other fixed points of space or duration, as that it {{was in the middle of}} Lincoln's Inn Fields, or the first degree of Taurus, and in the year of our Lord 1671, or the 1000th year of the Julian period. All which distances we measure by preconceived ideas of certain lengths of space and duration,--as inches, feet, miles, and degrees, and in the other, minutes, days, and years, &c.|$|R
