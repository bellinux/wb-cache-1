40|$|International audienceRobots {{with human}} {{appearance}} (i. e., <b>anthropomorphic</b> <b>robots)</b> {{are supposed to}} be better accepted by users because they are physically closer. However, several recent studies tend to contradict this idea. In this paper, two experiments are aiming to investigate the attitudes toward <b>anthropomorphic</b> <b>robots</b> for children, adolescents, adults and senior in France. In the first experiment, two hundred seventeen participants were asked to perform individually three successive tasks: to explain what a robot for him/her; complete our French translation of the negative attitudes scale toward robots called “NARS” (Nomura, Kanda, & Suzuki, 2006); and to sort by ascending order of preference eight robots shown in videos. In the second experiment, because the NARS is not adapted for youngest participants, forty-eight children were asked to perform the same successive tasks but with an adapted questionnaire for them by using a continuous rating scale. The results show that the physical appearance of robots is a key determinant of attitudes and opinions (positive and negative), whatever of age and gender of the participants. In addition, too much physical similarity with humans, i. e., anthropomorphism, produces negative attitudes towards robots for all the age groups. Our first experiment is a first validation of the French version of the “NARS” for French teenagers, adults and seniors. Our second experiment is a first validation of an adapted version of the NARS for French children, by using a continuous rating scale. Moreover, contrary to what some researchers in human–robot interaction (HRI) suggested, the negative attitudes towards <b>anthropomorphic</b> <b>robots</b> exist for youngest participants, i. e., for future users of these <b>anthropomorphic</b> <b>robots.</b> In other words, the design of <b>anthropomorphic</b> <b>robots</b> does not necessarily accompanied positive attitudes towards them for all actual and/or future users. Les robots à forme humaine (i. e., anthropomorphes) sont censés être mieux acceptés par les usagers parce qu’ils sont plus proches physiquement. Pourtant, plusieurs études menées en Asie tendent à contredire cette approche. Dans deux études, nous nous intéressons aux attitudes vis-à-vis de ces robots anthropomorphes chez des enfants, adolescents, adultes et seniors français. Les participants devaient individuellement réaliser trois tâches successives : expliquer ce qu’est un robot pour lui/elle; exprimer leurs opinions à l’égard des robots; classer par ordre croissant de préférence huit robots présentés dans des vidéos. Les résultats montrent que l’apparence physique des robots est le facteur déterminant des attitudes et opinions, quels que soient l’âge et le genre des participants. De plus, la trop grande similitude physique avec l’humain, i. e., l’anthropomorphisme, explique en grande partie les attitudes négatives vis-à-vis des robots, quel que soit l’âge...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{technological}} improvements {{made during}} the last decade, bipedal robots today present a surprisingly high level of humanoid skill. Autonomy, {{with respect to the}} processing of information, is realized to a relatively high degree. What is mainly lacking in robotics, moving from purely <b>anthropomorphic</b> <b>robots</b> to ‘anthropofunctional’ machines, is energetic autonomy. In a previously published analysis, we showed that closer attention to the functional morphology of human walking could give robotic engineers the experiences of an at least 6 Myr beta test period on minimization of power requirements for biped locomotion. From our point of view, there are two main features that facilitate sustained walking in modern humans. The first main feature is the existence of ‘energetically optimal velocities’ provided by the systematic use of various resonance mechanisms: (a) suspended pendula (involving arms as well as legs in the swing phase of the gait cycle) and matching of the pendular length of the upper and lower limbs; (b) inverted pendula (involving the legs in the stance phase), driven by torsional springs around the ankle joints; and (c) torsional springs in the trunk. The second main feature is compensation for undesirable torques induced by the inertial properties of the swinging extremities: (a) mass distribution in the trunk characterized by maximized mass moments of inertia; (b) lever arms of joint forces at the hip and shoulder, which are inversely proportional to their amplitude; and (c) twisting of the trunk, especially torsion. Our qualitative conclusions are three-fold. (1) Human walking is an interplay between masses, gravity and elasticity, which is modulated by musculature. Rigid body mechanics is insufficient to describe human walking. Thus <b>anthropomorphic</b> <b>robots</b> completely following the rules of rigid body mechanics cannot be functionally humanoid. (2) Humans are vertebrates. Thus, <b>anthropomorphic</b> <b>robots</b> that do not use the trunk for purposes of motion are not truly humanoid. (3) The occurrence of a waist, especially characteristic of humans, implies the existence of rotations between the upper trunk (head, neck, pectoral girdle and thorax) and the lower trunk (pelvic girdle) via an elastic joint (spine, paravertebral and abdominal musculature). A torsional twist around longitudinal axes seems to be the most important...|$|R
