40|$|DC {{distribution}} is a promising technology for addressing incoming issues in AC conventional distribution. In marine power systems, {{given the high}} power requirements of electric propelled vessels, Medium Voltage DC (MVDC) {{distribution is}} on study. Among all the relevant issues of DC distribution, short circuit currents definition and interruption is the most problematic now. Rail-to-rail faults are commonly studied, and models and methods to address their calculation are present in literature. Conversely, rail-to-ground faults are more complex to assess. Indeed, their fault loop include also <b>AC</b> <b>generation</b> <b>systems,</b> so their grounding configuration must be considered. Moreover, rail-to-ground faults produce currents that can be non-symmetrical and non-sinusoidal on AC side, depending on DC side grounding configuration, rendering unsuitable common system models and methods to assess fault currents. In this paper, a study on fault currents in a shipboard power system with different DC side grounding configurations has been done, highlighting when the resulting currents are symmetrical or not. Considerations about practical applicability of proposed configurations has been also done, pointing out pros and cons and defining the most recommendable practices...|$|R

Obtaining accurate average-value models of individual subsystems {{that can be used for}} extracting the input/output impedance as well as for increasing the simulation speed of the respective models. In this paper, a parametric approach for developing a dynamic average-value model of a generator-rectifier subsystem is presented. The method initially requires a detailed switched model from which the rectifier/dc-link dynamics are captured using numerical averaging; however, the resulting model is continuous and computationally efficient. The developed average-value model is compared against measured and detailed simulation results and is shown to be very accurate in both the time- and frequency-domains. A 74 -fold increase in simulation speed is achieved. Key-Words:- naval electric systems, synchronous generator, average value model, impedance, simulation. ...|$|R
