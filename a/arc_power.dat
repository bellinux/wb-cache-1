The traditional <b>arc</b> welding <b>power</b> source is backward in technology and large amount of consumables, so <b>arc</b> welding inverter <b>power</b> has become the direction of its development. With the enhanced awareness of energy saving and environmental protection, this paper concentrates on new high <b>power</b> factor of <b>arc</b> welding <b>power</b> source as the research object, and introduces the main structure of high-power <b>arc</b> welding <b>power</b> source. At the same time, using Matlab software for modeling and simulation analysis on the main circuit and control circuit, the simulation results comply with the design requirements and verify the feasibility of the system design...|$|R

The predicted arc current and incident energy are used in selecting appropriate overcurrent protective devices and personal protective equipment (generally abbreviated as PPE), as well as defining safe working distance. Since {{the magnitude of the}} arc current is inherently linked with the degree of arc hazard, the arc is examined as a circuit parameter. Furthermore, since estimations are often useful, simple equations for predicting ballpark arc current, <b>arc</b> <b>power,</b> and incident energy values and probable ranges are presented in this work.|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{study has been}} undertaken to investigate the dependencies of particle and power fluxes on {{the parameters of the}} deposition process and the relation with the quality of the deposited layers. The conclusions on this part of the work are: (1) The heat transfer to the substrate increases with the <b>arc</b> <b>power</b> and the argon flow in the arc. (2) The deposition rate increases with the <b>arc</b> <b>power,</b> the argon flow and the toluene flow. (3) The specific deposition rate increases strongly with <b>arc</b> <b>power.</b> These observations can qualitatively be explained as follows. The arc injects a partially ionized plasma of 0. 5 - 1 eV temperature. The ion fraction can charge exchange with toluene molecules leading to atomic ions or radical formation by subsequent dissociative recombination. These radicals are the active species in the deposition process. Hence higher <b>arc</b> <b>power</b> involving a higher ionization degree in the argon flow leads to a larger deposition rate...|$|E

40|$|Local anode {{heat flux}} in a quasi-steady MPD {{thruster}} {{is measured by}} thermocouples attached to the inside surface of a shell anode. Over a range of arc currents J from 5. 5 to 44 kiloamperes and argon propellant mass flows m from 1 to 48 g/sec, with the ratio J 2 /m held constant, the fraction of <b>arc</b> <b>power</b> deposited in the anode is found to decrease with increasing <b>arc</b> <b>power.</b> Specifically, this anode power fraction decreases from 50 % at 200 kW <b>arc</b> <b>power,</b> to 10 % at 20 MW. In an effort to account for this functional behavior, the current density, plasma potential, and electron temperature in the plasma adjacent to the anode are measured with probes, {{and the results are}} used in a theoretical anode heat flux model.

40|$|For a {{thermally}} sprayed coating, {{a strong}} adhesion between the coating and the substrate {{is critical for}} its service performance. Furthermore, the adhesion between the coating and the substrate is mainly controlled by the splat-substrate adhesion. Therefore, enhancing the splat-substrate adhesion {{is important for the}} preparation and application of thermally sprayed coating. In the present work, individual cast iron splats were deposited on polished aluminium surfaces by atmospheric plasma spraying technique (APS) with varying plasma arc powers and spray distances. After spraying, the splat-substrate interfacial structure was examined by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The effects of the <b>arc</b> <b>power</b> and spray distance on the morphology of the splats were studied. It was found that high <b>arc</b> <b>power</b> promoted splat-substrate adhesion by elevating the temperature and velocity of the impinging particles compared to low <b>arc</b> <b>power.</b> Moreover, a short spray distance promoted splat-substrate adhesion due to the heating of the substrate surface by the plasma jet and the high impinging velocity of the particles compared to a long spray distance...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} partial {{penetration}} Variable Polarity Plasma Arc welds {{were made at}} equal power but various combinations of current and voltage on 2219 Aluminum. Arc efficiency was measured calorimetrically and ranged between 48 % and 66 % for {{the conditions of the}} welds. Arc efficiency depends in different ways on voltage and current. The voltage effect dominates. Raising voltage while reducing current increases arc efficiency. Longer, higher voltage arcs are thought to transfer a greater portion of <b>arc</b> <b>power</b> to the workpiece through shield gas convection. Melting efficiency depends upon weld pool shape as well as arc efficiency. Increased current increases the melting efficiency as it increases the depth to width ratio of the weld pool. Increased plasma gas flow does the same thing. Higher currents are thought to raise arc pressure and depress liquid {{at the bottom of the}} weld pool. More <b>arc</b> <b>power</b> then transfers to the workpiece through increasing plasma gas convection.
