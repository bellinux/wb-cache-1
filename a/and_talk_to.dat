5|$|In most Dragon Quest games, players must visit {{a church}} (known as a House of Healing in the NES translations) <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> a priest or nun {{to save the}} games' progress; in Dragon Warrior, players {{had to talk to}} a king to save their progress, though the first two Dragon Quest titles for Famicom use a {{password}} save system. If the party dies in battle the group loses half of its gold and warps to the nearest save location where the hero is revived; players must then pay a priest or nun to revive their party members.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} for {{the film}} began in October 2012 with film's lead cast. The film was shot in Goa, Mumbai and Cape Town.

40|$|We {{explored}} {{the functions of}} team monitoring <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the room (undirected <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> relay relevant information or comment {{on the performance of}} real-time self behavior) for effects on team interaction and performance in 27 anesthesia teams in the clinical setting. Immediate reactions <b>to</b> team monitoring <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the room were investigated by means of lag sequential analysis. As expected, we found that in high performing teams, immediate consequences of team monitoring were speaking-up and providing unsolicited assistance. <b>Talking</b> <b>to</b> the room led <b>to</b> further <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the room <b>and</b> substituted explicit coordination. The results highlight the relevance of team monitoring <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the room for team coordination and performance in dynamic healthcare environments...|$|R

Meanwhile, Dwight, Jim, and Harry rush to the company in an attempt to win the client, only to hear that the company has gone with Andy. After Andy wins the client, he calls Robert and offers him the client if Robert will re-hire him. Robert is furious at his attempt to blackmail him, and hangs up on Andy. This leads Andy to seek help from David Wallace (Andy Buckley), the former Chief Financial Officer of Dunder Mifflin who has become a multi-millionaire. Andy tells David that, despite being in poor shape, Dunder Mifflin could be worth twice its net worth if the company's management is restructured.

5|$|Armed {{with an air}} gun, Huseby {{threatened}} a cabin attendant and told the captain to proceed as planned to Fornebu. He claimed (falsely) to have placed explosives on board.

During one of those dates, Jack invites her to a TGS VIP party he has hastily staged, whereupon he enlists the help of Jon Bon Jovi—at the time NBC's real-life Artist in Residence—to come over <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them, in an effort to impress the successful Avery. When Bon Jovi approaches them, though, Jack disregards him due to his own intriguing conversation with Avery, which impresses her even more.

5|$|Reyes and Doggett {{arrive in}} Novi <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Detective Van Allen (James McDonnell), who seems apathetic about the case. At the same time, Scully {{contacts}} Dr. Bertram Mueller (George D. Wallace), a former medical examiner who autopsied several {{bodies in the}} 1960s that were skinned {{in a manner similar}} to Potts. Mueller tells Scully that the sheriff at the time did not pay much attention to the cases, emphasizing that there was more than one victim, and that he later killed himself. Reyes and Doggett receive news of Terry's attack and arrive at the local butchery to find him strung up among the pigs. While looking around the crime scene, Doggett discovers that Terry is still alive; Terry weakly says Ed's name. Doggett and the local police arrest Ed, who claims that he is innocent. Reyes believes him and admits that she too is having similar visions. Ed is freed, but not before having a vision in which Dr. Holland is skinned. In the meantime, Scully discovers that Potts and Terry were both born on the same day that two of the 1960s murder victims died.|$|E

25|$|Investigators {{at first}} focused on Emile and Roldan, since {{both of them}} {{might have had a}} motive to harm Bethany due to the love {{triangle}} they were involved in.

25|$|Steinbergs also filmed a {{video in}} which he and his two companions (his girlfriend and another student) {{approach}} the smoking crater <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> each other excitedly when they apparently discover a burning mass {{at the bottom of}} the crater. The deliberately amateur style of the video, with shaky handheld camerawork and apparently spontaneous reactions from the students, has been compared to The Blair Witch Project. The video was published on YouTube and news websites, attracting worldwide interest. Landowner Larisa Gerasimova reportedly charged visitors the equivalent of $2 each to view the crater.|$|E
25|$|He {{developed}} a reputation as being very friendly with children. He carried candy in his pockets for the street urchins in Mantua and Venice, and taught catechism to them. During papal audiences, he would gather children around him <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them about things that interested them. His weekly catechism lessons {{in the courtyard of}} San Damaso in the Vatican always included a special place for children, and his decision to require the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine in every parish was partly motivated by a desire to reclaim children from religious ignorance.|$|E
