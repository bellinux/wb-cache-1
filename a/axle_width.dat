50|$|The {{standardization}} of currency with this round coinage {{was part of}} a broader plan to unify weights, measures or <b>axle</b> <b>width</b> during the Qin empire. Ban Liang coins continued to be used under the Western Han dynasty until they were finally replaced by the Wu Zhu coins in 118 BC.|$|E
5000|$|In general an <b>axle</b> <b>width</b> {{should be}} chosen that {{is close to}} the width of the deck it will be used with. For example, a 7.75" [...] wide deck will usually be fitted with trucks that have axles between 7.5" [...] wide and 8.0" [...] wide. (Standard truck axle nut size is 5/16"-24tpi UNF, and the thinner [...] "jam" [...] style with an {{optional}} nylon lock.) Trucks that are too wide can make doing tricks difficult and can cause the wheels {{to get in the way}} when the skateboard is being ridden. Trucks that are too small can be hard to maintain stability and can cause wheel bite to occur when turning.|$|E
5000|$|Slopestyle (SS) {{bikes are}} a strange blend of Dirt Jump and Freeride bikes, having the {{geometry}} similar to Dirt Jumpers, but with approximately 4" [...] (100mm) of suspension travel {{in both the}} front and rear. These bikes are mostly used by professional slopestyle riders, this specific usage being their origin, and as such are designed for the extremely large jumps and high speeds encountered in competition. The frames are either adapted from existing All-Mountain or Freeride designs or designed specifically for the purpose, with durable frame designs and sophisticated suspension linkages {{to make the most}} of their minimal suspension travel. These bikes usually have relatively slack head angles, relative to their short suspension travel, with a slightly more aggressive overall geometry than the Dirt Jumpers many are based on. These bikes are often equipped with a mix of Dirt Jump and All-Mountain interface specifications (headset size, bottom bracket style, rear <b>axle</b> <b>width</b> and diameter, rear derailleur hanger) to accommodate both Freeride and Dirt Jump components as necessary to handle the high speeds and harsh impacts associated with their use. Slopestyle bikes are also used for light downhill or trail riding by many, if not riding jumps on the same scale as professional riders, with their durability and sophisticated suspension designs allowing for extra versatility when compared to Dirt Jump bikes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{discusses}} {{efforts to}} parameterize the actuation models of a four-wheel automobile {{for the purposes}} of closed-loop control. As a novelty, the authors used the equipment already available or in use by the vehicle, rather than expensive equipment used solely for the purpose of system identification. After rudimentary measurements were taken of wheelbase, <b>axle</b> <b>width,</b> etc., the vehicle was driven and data were captured using a controller area network (CAN) interface. Based on this captured data, we were able to estimate the feasibility of certain closed-loop controllers, and the models they assumed (i. e., linear, or nonlinear) for control. Examples were acceleration and steering. This work served to inform the separation of differences in simulation and vehicle behavior during vehicle testing. I...|$|E
40|$|Farmers {{experience}} whole-body vibrations {{when they}} drive tractors. Among the various {{factors that influence}} the vibrations to which the driver is exposed are terrain roughness, tractor speed, tire type and pressure, rear <b>axle</b> <b>width,</b> and tractor seat height above the ground. In this paper the influence of tractor seat height above the ground on the lateral vibrations to which the tractor driver is exposed is studied {{by means of a}} geometrical and an experimental analysis. Both analyses show that: (i) lateral vibrations experienced by a tractor driver increase linearly with tractor-seat height above the ground; (ii) lateral vibrations to which the tractor driver is exposed can equal or exceed vertical vibrations; (iii) in medium-size tractors, a feasible 30 cm reduction in the height of the tractor seat, which represents only 15 % of its current height, will reduce the lateral vibrations by around 20 %; and (iv) vertical vibrations are scarcely influenced by tractor-seat height above the ground. The results suggest that manufacturers could increase the comfort of tractors by lowering tractor-seat height above the ground, which will reduce lateral vibrations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} a processing {{preparation for}} micro-electrode array fabrication by micro wire electrical discharge machining. Based on a self-developed micro-WEDM machine tool and adopted thin tungsten wire electrode of 30 µm in diameter, {{a series of}} experiments on micro-electrode array machining are introduced. The relationship between the discharge gap and working area of wire discharge under given voltage is investigated. The examination for micro-girder structure forming process has gone along and the <b>axle</b> journal's minimized <b>width</b> of least micro girder which could not bring on machining flexural thermal deformation has been obtained. The clamping method of work-piece intended for electrode array fabrication is analyzed and a special fixture is designed. The factors affecting forming accuracy are summarized. An amounted 5 × 5 squared-disk-type micro-electrode array structure with a high aspect ration, namely 20 µm in <b>axle</b> journal <b>width</b> and 500 µm in length of a single electrode, has been machined successfully...|$|R

50|$|The car was {{initially}} built {{with the same}} 2700 mm wheelbase as the Typ 200 (W 21). It also inherited the sophisticated all-round independent suspension system originally introduced with the manufacturer’s smaller Mercedes-Benz W15 model. There was no full <b>width</b> <b>axle</b> at the front, the wheels being suspended from two transverse leaf springs. At the back there were two half swing-axles.|$|R
50|$|Codes inside {{parentheses}} are internal {{codes that}} identify some technical {{characteristics of the}} variants, like length/wheelbase, number of <b>axles,</b> floor height, <b>width,</b> engine arrangement and so on. Some codes are unique to one variant, while others are shared between variants. Some variants have changed from one code to another over time. These codes are sometimes mistakenly used as a model designation. One can find the codes in VINs (ie. WMAA21...) and in vehicle production serial numbers (ie. A210012).|$|R
5000|$|The 170 was {{the first}} Mercedes with all-round {{independent}} suspension. There was no full <b>width</b> <b>axle</b> at the front, the wheels being suspended from two transverse leaf springs. At the back there were two half swing-axles. The suspension lay-out, which minimized unsprung mass and provided {{a high level of}} stability, was subsequently introduced across the entire Mercedes-Benz range, giving the cars a quality of comfort and safety that competitors using the then common combination of rigid axles and leaf springing could not match.|$|R
5000|$|... 00 {{models can}} be {{converted}} to work on EM or P4 by replacing or reprofiling wheels, fitting the correct <b>width</b> <b>axles</b> and moving the locomotive or carriage frames outward to suit. Modern products from Hornby, Bachmann UK and others have some element of springing in their suspension to aid this, and many aftermarket chassis kits exist from a variety of vendors such as high level kits, Comet, DJH, and others. Products intended for the more dedicated modeller are generally designed to be buildable to fit any of the three standards, though one side effect of underscale locomotive frames for 00 gauge is that the width between the frames is limited, which can limit the size of electric motor that may be fitted.|$|R

2500|$|The Friskysprint was a {{prototype}} sports racing car {{built at the}} Meadows factory and said {{to be capable of}} [...] Press reports stated that on production versions the front suspension and probably the chassis and running gear would be made at the Vickers–Armstrongs (Aircraft) factory at South Marston. The prototype was finished in the American national racing colours of white with a blue stripe. It featured two bucket seats and a three-cylinder air-cooled [...] Excelsior engine mounted transversely in the frame with final drive by roller chain. Unlike all other Friskys, the rear <b>axle</b> was full <b>width</b> and fitted with a differential. The car was also independently sprung using a swing axle layout. It was expected to sell for between £675 and £750 including purchase tax. The Friskysprint never reached production and Gordon Bedson who designed and built the prototype left to join Lightburn in Australia the following spring to produce the Zeta Sports. The Friskysprint and Zeta Sports had some similarities in styling but were otherwise unconnected and despite Lightburn advertising to the contrary, Giovanni Michelotti was not involved in the design of either car.|$|R
