25|$|A {{varistor}} is {{an electronic}} component with an electrical resistance that {{varies with the}} applied voltage. Also known as a voltage-dependent resistor (VDR), it has a nonlinear, non-ohmic current–voltage characteristic {{that is similar to}} that of <b>a</b> <b>diode.</b> In contrast to <b>a</b> <b>diode</b> however, it has the same characteristic for both directions of traversing current. At low voltage it has a high electrical resistance which decreases as the voltage is raised.|$|E
25|$|Because base–emitter voltage varies as the {{logarithm}} of the base–emitter and collector–emitter currents, a BJT {{can also}} be used to compute logarithms and anti-logarithms. <b>A</b> <b>diode</b> can also perform these nonlinear functions but the transistor provides more circuit flexibility.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, Joel S. Spira, {{who would}} found the Lutron Electronics Company in 1961, invented a dimmer based on <b>a</b> <b>diode</b> and a tapped autotransformer, saving energy and {{allowing}} the dimmer to be installed in a standard electrical wallbox.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> laser <b>diode,</b> or LD {{also known}} as {{injection}} laser diode or ILD, is an electrically pumped semiconductor laser in which the active laser medium is formed by a p-n junction of <b>a</b> semiconductor <b>diode</b> similar to that found in <b>a</b> light-emitting <b>diode.</b>|$|R
25|$|For special purposes, other active {{elements}} {{have been}} used. For example, {{in the early}} days of the satellite communication, parametric amplifiers were used. The core circuit was <b>a</b> <b>diode</b> whose capacitance was changed by an RF signal created locally. Under certain conditions, this RF signal provided energy that was modulated by the extremely weak satellite signal received at the earth station.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>diode</b> {{clamp circuit}} {{can take a}} {{periodic}} alternating current signal that oscillates between positive and negative values, and vertically displace it such that either the positive, or the negative peaks occur at a prescribed level. The clamper does not restrict the peak-to-peak excursion of the signal, it moves the whole signal up or down so as to place the peaks at the reference level.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{technologies}} used for variable-gain amplification, each having different advantages and disadvantages. Vacuum tubes are used in a configuration called variable-mu where the grid-to-cathode voltage changes to alter the gain. Optical compressors use a photoresistor and a small lamp (Incandescent, LED or electroluminescent panel) to create changes in signal gain. Other technologies used include field effect transistors and <b>a</b> <b>diode</b> bridge.|$|E
50|$|Lambda diodes work {{at higher}} voltage than tunnel <b>diodes.</b> Whereas <b>a</b> typical tunnel <b>diode</b> may exhibit {{negative}} differential resistance approximately between 70 mV and 350 mV, this region occurs approximately between 1.5 V and 6 V in <b>a</b> lambda <b>diode</b> {{due to the}} higher pinch-off voltages of typical JFET devices. <b>A</b> lambda <b>diode</b> therefore cannot replace <b>a</b> tunnel <b>diode</b> directly.|$|R

25|$|A crystal radio receiver, {{also called}} a crystal set or cat's whisker receiver, {{is a very}} simple radio receiver, popular {{in the early days}} of radio. It needs no other power source but that {{received}} solely from the power of radio waves received by a wire antenna. It gets its name from its most important component, known as a crystal detector, originally made from a piece of crystalline mineral such as galena. This component is now called <b>a</b> <b>diode.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rectifiers {{are also}} used for {{detection}} of amplitude modulated radio signals. The signal may be amplified before detection. If not, a very low voltage drop diode or <b>a</b> <b>diode</b> biased with a fixed voltage must be used. When using a rectifier for demodulation the capacitor and load resistance must be carefully matched: too low a capacitance makes the high frequency carrier pass to the output, and too high makes the capacitor just charge and stay charged.|$|E
25|$|Diode lasers of {{that era}} {{operated}} with threshold current densities of 1000 A/cm2 at 77 K temperatures. Such performance enabled continuous-lasing to be demonstrated in the earliest days. However, when operated at room temperature, about 300 K, threshold current densities were two orders of magnitude greater, or 100,000 A/cm2 in the best devices. The dominant challenge {{for the remainder of}} the 1960s was to obtain low threshold current density at 300 K and thereby to demonstrate continuous-wave lasing at room temperature from <b>a</b> <b>diode</b> laser.|$|E

25|$|To {{produce the}} {{circular}} motion, they used another concept {{known as the}} magnetron. The magnetron is essentially <b>a</b> <b>diode</b> that uses a magnetic field to control {{the path of the}} electrons from cathode to anode instead of the more common solution of an electrically charged grid. This was initially invented as a way to avoid patents on grid-based tubes but proved to be impractical in that role. Follow-up studies had noted the ability of the magnetron to create small levels of microwaves under certain conditions, but only halting development had taken place along these lines.|$|E
25|$|In 1910 Hans Gerdien of the Siemens {{corporation}} {{invented a}} magnetron. In 1912, Swiss physicist Heinrich Greinacher {{was looking for}} new ways to calculate the electron mass. He settled on a system consisting of <b>a</b> <b>diode</b> with a cylindrical anode surrounding a rod-shaped cathode, placed {{in the middle of a}} magnet. The attempt to measure the electron mass failed because he was unable to achieve a good vacuum in the tube. However, as part of this work, Greinacher developed mathematical models of the motion of the electrons in the crossed magnetic and electric fields.|$|E
25|$|Nanofluidic diodes are {{utilized}} for rectification of ionic transport. <b>A</b> <b>diode</b> in electronic circuits limits {{the flow of}} electric current to one direction. A nanofluidic diode has the same function to restrict the ionic flow in one direction. A nanofluidic diode is a channel with its radius dimension of several nanometers. The inner surface of the channel is coated with surface charges. Current rectification can occur when the surface charges at the wall are of the same sign. It is also observed that, when a half of the channel is coated with opposite sign or electrically neutral, the rectification will be enhanced.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> laser <b>diode,</b> or LD {{also known}} as {{injection}} laser diode or ILD, is a semiconductor device similar to <b>a</b> light-emitting <b>diode</b> in which the laser beam is created at the diode's junction.|$|R
2500|$|<b>A</b> Zener <b>diode</b> is <b>a</b> type of <b>diode</b> {{that permits}} current {{in the forward}} {{direction}} like <b>a</b> normal <b>diode,</b> {{but also in the}} reverse direction if the voltage is larger than the breakdown voltage known as [...] "Zener knee voltage" [...] or [...] "Zener voltage". The device was named after Clarence Zener, who discovered this electrical property.|$|R
5000|$|To derive the {{diffusion}} current in <b>a</b> semiconductor <b>diode,</b> the depletion layer must be large {{compared to the}} mean free path.One begins with the equation for the net current density J in <b>a</b> semiconductor <b>diode,</b> ...|$|R
25|$|Diodes are {{frequently}} used to conduct damaging high voltages away from sensitive electronic devices. They are usually reverse-biased (non-conducting) under normal circumstances. When the voltage {{rises above the}} normal range, the diodes become forward-biased (conducting). For example, diodes are used in (stepper motor and H-bridge) motor controller and relay circuits to de-energize coils rapidly without the damaging voltage spikes that would otherwise occur. (<b>A</b> <b>diode</b> used in such an application is called a flyback diode). Many integrated circuits also incorporate diodes on the connection pins to prevent external voltages from damaging their sensitive transistors. Specialized diodes are used to protect from over-voltages at higher power (see Diode types above).|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>diode</b> {{can be used}} as a {{temperature}} measuring device, since the forward voltage drop across the diode depends on temperature, as in a silicon bandgap temperature sensor. From the Shockley ideal diode equation given above, it might appear that the voltage has a positive temperature coefficient (at a constant current), but usually the variation of the reverse saturation current term is more significant than the variation in the thermal voltage term. Most diodes therefore have a negative temperature coefficient, typically −2 mV/˚C for silicon diodes. The temperature coefficient is approximately constant for temperatures above about 20 kelvins. Some graphs are given for 1N400x series, and CY7 cryogenic temperature sensor.|$|E
25|$|Amateur Radio {{operators}} {{needed to}} modify their transmitters to allow for HF RTTY operation. This was accomplished by adding a frequency shift keyer that used <b>a</b> <b>diode</b> to switch a capacitor {{in and out of}} the circuit, shifting the transmitter’s frequency in synchronism with the teleprinter signal changing from mark to space to mark. A very stable transmitter was required for RTTY. The typical frequency multiplication type transmitter that was popular in the 1950s and 1960s would be relatively stable on 80 meters but become progressively less stable on 40 meters, 20 meters and 15 meters. By the middle 1960s, transmitter designs were updated, mixing a crystal-controlled high frequency oscillator with a variable low frequency oscillator, resulting in better frequency stability across all Amateur Radio HF bands.|$|E
50|$|The {{precision}} rectifier, {{also known}} as <b>a</b> super <b>diode,</b> is <b>a</b> configuration obtained with an operational amplifier {{in order to have}} a circuit behave like <b>an</b> ideal <b>diode</b> and rectifier. It is useful for high-precision signal processing.|$|R
5000|$|Firstly, let us {{consider}} <b>a</b> mathematically idealized <b>diode.</b> In such <b>an</b> ideal <b>diode,</b> if the diode is reverse biased, the current flowing through it is zero. This ideal diode starts conducting at 0 V and for any positive voltage an infinite current flows and the <b>diode</b> acts like <b>a</b> short circuit. The I-V characteristics of <b>an</b> ideal <b>diode</b> are shown below: ...|$|R
30|$|P-type doping of ZnO {{is still}} a problem that diminishes the {{prospects}} of a ZnO p-n homojunction device [4]. On the other hand, ZnO is naturally n-doped and does not need external dopants. <b>A</b> Schottky <b>diode</b> {{seems to be a}} very feasible device from ZnO. <b>A</b> Schottky barrier <b>diode</b> exhibits faster switching and lower turn-on voltages as compared to <b>a</b> p-n junction <b>diode</b> and there is some optical loss in the p-region of <b>a</b> p-n <b>diode.</b> That makes it a very useful for electronic and optoelectronic application.|$|R
25|$|Operation of a {{solar cell}} can be {{understood}} from the equivalent circuit at right. Light, of sufficient energy (greater than the bandgap of the material), creates mobile electron–hole pairs in a semiconductor. Charge separation occurs because of a pre-existing electric field associated with the p-n junction in thermal equilibrium (a contact potential creates the field). This charge separation between positive holes and negative electrons across a p-n junction (<b>a</b> <b>diode)</b> yields a forward voltage, the photo voltage, between the illuminated diode terminals. As has been noted earlier in the terminology section, the photo voltage is {{sometimes referred to as}} the photo emf, rather than distinguishing between the effect and the cause. The charge separation causes a photo voltage that drives current through any attached load.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>diode</b> is a two-terminal {{electronic}} component that conducts current primarily {{in one direction}} (asymmetric conductance); it has low (ideally zero) resistance in one direction, and high (ideally infinite) resistance in the other. A semiconductor diode, {{the most common type}} today, is a crystalline piece of semiconductor material with a p–n junction connected to two electrical terminals. A vacuum tube diode has two electrodes, a plate (anode) and a heated cathode. Semiconductor diodes were the first semiconductor electronic devices. The discovery of crystals' rectifying abilities was made by German physicist Ferdinand Braun in 1874. The first semiconductor diodes, called cat's whisker diodes, developed around 1906, were made of mineral crystals such as galena. Today, most diodes are made of silicon, but other materials such as selenium and germanium are sometimes used.|$|E
25|$|Since modern {{thyristors}} {{can switch}} {{power on the}} scale of megawatts, thyristor valves have become the heart of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) conversion either to or from alternating current. In the realm of this and other very high-power applications, both electrically triggered (ETT) and light-triggered (LTT) thyristors are still the primary choice. The valves are arranged in stacks usually suspended from the ceiling of a transmission building called a valve hall. Thyristors are arranged into <b>a</b> <b>diode</b> bridge circuit and to reduce harmonics are connected in series to form a 12-pulse converter. Each thyristor is cooled with deionized water, and the entire arrangement becomes one of multiple identical modules forming a layer in a multilayer valve stack called a quadruple valve. Three such stacks are typically mounted on the floor or hung from the ceiling of the valve hall of a long-distance transmission facility.|$|E
50|$|In {{semiconductor}} devices, <b>a</b> backward <b>diode</b> (also {{called back}} <b>diode)</b> is <b>a</b> variation on <b>a</b> Zener <b>diode</b> or tunnel <b>diode</b> having <b>a</b> better conduction for small reverse biases (for example -0.1 to -0.6 V) than for forward bias voltages.|$|R
5000|$|Like <b>a</b> typical <b>diode,</b> {{there is}} <b>a</b> fixed anode and cathode in <b>a</b> Zener <b>diode,</b> {{but it will}} conduct current in the reverse {{direction}} (electrons flow from anode to cathode) if its breakdown voltage or [...] "Zener voltage" [...] is exceeded.|$|R
50|$|In <b>a</b> PIN <b>diode,</b> the {{depletion}} region exists almost completely within the intrinsic region. This depletion region {{is much larger}} than in <b>a</b> PN <b>diode,</b> and almost constant-size, independent of the reverse bias applied to the diode. This increases the volume where electron-hole pairs can be generated by an incident photon. Some photodetector devices, such as PIN photodiodes and phototransistors (in which the base-collector junction is <b>a</b> PIN <b>diode),</b> use <b>a</b> PIN junction in their construction.|$|R
