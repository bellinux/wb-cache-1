40|$|In the 1980 s, the Producer Subsidy Equivalent (PSE) {{became the}} {{dominant}} measure of protection in applied studies of international agricultural trade. This paper analyzes potential biases in the ratio {{form of the}} PSE introduced by using <b>actual</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>prices</b> rather than social opportunity costs in the denominator. It is shown that doing so introduces a consistent under-estimation {{of the effects of}} trade restrictions and other price-support policies, relative to deficiency payments and other income-support policies. It is found that under plausible conditions this bias leads the PSE to rank protection levels across countries or crops incorrectly. In a sample of 250 activities across 33 countries, such errors were found to occur in 5 % of crop comparisons and 8 % of country comparisons, including a number of politically sensitive cases. An improved formula would therefore provide significantly more accurate results than the conventional PSE, with no additional data or more restrictive assumptions.

40|$|The {{main concern}} {{of this study}} is to obtain an optimal time path of crude oil and natural gas {{production}} by controlling the pressure at the bottom of any producing well in Walton Canyon Reservoir. To achieve this goal, the following objectives were obtained: (a) an estimation of the reservoir properties at different levels of the reservoir pressure; (b) an estimation of an optimal time path of joint production using the estimated reservoir properties and the expected prices and costs in the absence and presence of severance, state, and federal income taxes, and depletion of allowances; and (c) an analysis of the changes in the rates of extraction, firms 2 ̆ 7 profits, revenues to local, state, and federal governments, and welfare losses as a result of changes in tax policies. To conduct this study, an optimization model is used to maximize the present value of net revenues of firms producing oil and gas in the reservoir, subject to the available stock of oil in the ground. Cost per unit of time is discussed at three stages of production (naturally flowing, pumping, and secondary recovery or pressure maintenance). Using the assumption that all producing wells in the reservoir are at the pumping stage of production, the conclusion is made that only the operating cost is related to the bottom well-hole flowing pressure. Since the goal is to control the rates of joint production by controlling the bottom well-hole flowing pressure, the operating cost of the whole reservoir is minimized through separable programming. The non-linear cost equation is solved for the values of the bottom well-hole flowing pressure under a competitive condition in the absence of externalities. In order to estimate the optimal rates of oil and gas production, the expected prices are computed using the <b>actual</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>prices</b> of oil, gas, and electricity. The optimal rates of oil and gas production are obtained through dynamic programming which is applied to the optimization model using a 15 percent discount rate. However, discount rates of 10 percent and 20 percent also are used to determine the influences on the optimal production plan, allowing the production period for twenty years. The empirical results indicate that the production of oil and gas from this reservoir will be profitable in the future, using a 15 percent discount rate, prior to imposition of any taxes. The whole recoverable stock of oil by pump will be extracted within three years beginning with a higher production rate in 1998 and ending with a lower production rate in the year 2000. A 10 percent discount rate influenced the net revenue of the whole reservoir but did not change the production plan. However, the optimization model and, in particular, the production plan are affected by the 20 percent discount rate. In other words, the joint production is profitable in the early years, using a 20 percent discount rate, beginning with a higher production rate in 1982 and ending with a lower production rate in 1985. The important conclusion is that imposing various taxes and depletion allowances, while using a 15 percent discount rate, did not change the optimal time path of production from that time path, which was obtained in the absence of taxation using the same discount rate. The presence of taxation, however, affected revenues and, thereby, resulted in welfare changes in the producing firms and local, state, and federal governments...|$|R

40|$|It {{is almost}} {{invariably}} {{taken for granted}} in theoretical descriptions of the international price mechanism and {{in the construction of}} trade models that a country's export price for a particular product is identical to its <b>domestic</b> <b>price.</b> Any impact of foreign or <b>domestic</b> events on <b>prices</b> is expected to fall identically on the export and the <b>domestic</b> <b>price</b> for a good. In contrast to these conventional assumptions, the few empirical studies of international prices have shown that there are fairly substantial and long-lasting divergences between export and <b>domestic</b> <b>price</b> changes for the same or closely related products. If there can be divergences between export and <b>domestic</b> <b>prices,</b> a type of relative price mechanism may be at work: the depreciating country should find export prices rising relative to <b>domestic</b> <b>prices</b> of the same goods. Since a producer can shift more easily from domestic to export sales of a product than from production of home goods to production of export goods we should expect the changes within commodities between domestic sales and exports to occur more rapidly. Since the evidence is strong that there are divergences between export and <b>domestic</b> <b>prices,</b> we wish to trace through the effects of foreign price changes and exchange rate changes on export and <b>domestic</b> <b>prices</b> and see whether a mechanism of the hypothesized type exists.

40|$|This study {{examines}} how <b>domestic</b> <b>price</b> discrimination between fluid and manufacturing milk influences dairy trade. Two types of dairy models {{are used for}} the study. The first one is a stylized mathematical model {{which is used to}} explore the relative trade effects of <b>domestic</b> <b>price</b> discrimination accompanied with revenue pooling mechanism versus border measures in dairy product markets. The second one is a partial equilibrium, multiple-region model of dairy policy and trade, which is used to see the empirical implication of <b>domestic</b> <b>price</b> discrimination for six major dairy producers. The analytical results identify the trading status as the key to determine the relative trade effects. While <b>domestic</b> <b>price</b> discrimination is always less trade distorting than border measures in a net-importer case, the relative trade distortiveness depends on the export volume in a net exporter case. The theoretical possibility that <b>domestic</b> <b>price</b> discrimination is more trade distorting than border measures is found when the ratio of dairy export to domestic manufacturing milk consumption is very high. The results also indicate that while the both support measures increase dairy export, <b>domestic</b> <b>price</b> discrimination may place greater economic burden on fluid milk consumers and less economic burden on tax payers than border measures. In addition, the results imply that <b>domestic</b> <b>price</b> discrimination schemes can be effective trade protective measures for Canada, Japan and the United States, where the schemes are currently being implemented. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ...|$|R
