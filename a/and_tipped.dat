5|$|The {{accident}} {{that would take}} the life of Samuel Collyer came in July 1884. While responding to the fire alarm, hose carriage number one struck an upright stone post on the corner on Mineral Spring and Lonsdale Avenue <b>and</b> <b>tipped</b> over. All six firefighters were injured in the accident, those less seriously were on the step and seat of the carriage, but Collyer who rode on the reel was crushed underneath. Collyer sustained a punctured lung and broken ribs, but managed to survive for almost three weeks before succumbing to his injuries. Contemporary accounts state that the funeral service and procession were the most elaborate of any in the town's history. Collyer's home, known as the Potter-Collyer House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The skull was {{structured}} {{in such a}} way that as it closed, the bones holding the teeth in the upper jaw would bow out. This would cause the lower surfaces of the upper jaw teeth to rub against the upper surface of the lower jaw's teeth, grinding anything caught in between and providing an action that is the rough equivalent of mammalian chewing. Because the teeth were always replaced, the animal could have used this mechanism throughout its life, and could eat tough plant material. Additionally, the front ends of the animal's jaws were toothless <b>and</b> <b>tipped</b> with bony nodes, both upper and lower, providing a rough margin that was likely covered and lengthened by a keratinous material to form a cropping beak for biting off twigs and shoots. Its food gathering would have been aided by its flexible little finger, which could have been used to manipulate objects, unlike the other fingers.|$|E

40|$|The two {{closely related}} {{eukaryotic}} AAA+ proteins, <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49, are essential components of large multi-protein complexes {{that are involved}} in diverse cellular processes. Specific mechanisms for their activity in transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodelling, DNA repair and apoptosis have not yet been characterised; however, different oligomeric forms, sub-cellular localisation and post translational modification of <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 may be important in co-ordinating these functions. The assembly of the human <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 into different oligomers was studied. Both proteins were mainly monomeric in the absence of nucleotide cofactors. Incubation with ATP or ADP in the presence of Mg 2 + modified the distribution of TIP 48 oligomers to favour hexamers, but this did not occur with TIP 49. The double hexameric complex of TIP 48 /TIP 49 was also analysed and indicated a heterodisperse population of species, which provided clues about assembly pathways. <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 are structurally homologous to the bacterial branch migration motor RuvB. <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 do not incorporate the DNA binding domain present in RuvB, and instead have acquired a novel domain (Domain II) inserted between the Walker A and B ATPase motifs. Using mutants, we demonstrated that TIP 48 Domain II is critical for regulating nucleotide dependent hexamerisation of TIP 48. Furthermore, TIP 48 /TIP 49 complexes lacking Domain II indicated that hexamer-hexamer interactions are not exclusively mediated by Domain II; this domain may regulate the assembly of different forms of the heteromeric complex. Interactions between <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 <b>and</b> several putative binding partners were tested in vitro. The ATPase activity <b>and</b> oligomerisation of <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 were assayed in the presence of Hint 1, which was reported to disrupt the homotypic and heterotypic interactions within the TIP 48 /TIP 49 complex. Finally, the sub-cellular localisation and post translational modification of <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 were analysed. Using immunofluorescence <b>and</b> GFP-tagged <b>TIP</b> 49, we confirmed that <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 associate with the mitotic spindle; however, TIP 48 accumulates at the midbody during cytokinesis, while TIP 49 does not. Furthermore, we investigated potential modifications of <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 by 2 -D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which may account for the regulation of these distinct functions. ...|$|R
40|$|We use {{near-infrared}} {{observations of}} eight selected Galactic globular clusters to estimate their distances {{by comparing the}} observed and theoretically predicted K magnitudes of the red giant branch bumps <b>and</b> <b>tips.</b> The K magnitude levels of the RGB bump <b>and</b> <b>tip</b> have been measured from the luminosity function of the selected RGB stars in the clusters.

40|$|The box C/D small {{nucleolar}} RNPs (snoRNPs) {{are essential}} for the processing and modification of rRNA. <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 are two related AAA+ proteins that {{are essential for}} the formation of box C/D snoRNPs. These proteins are key components of the pre-snoRNP complexes, but their exact role in box C/D snoRNP biogenesis is largely uncharacterized. Here we report that <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 interact with one another in vitro, <b>and</b> only the <b>TIP</b> 48 /TIP 49 complex, but not the individual proteins, possesses significant ATPase activity. Loss of <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 results in a change in pre-snoRNA levels and a loss of U 3 snoRNA signal in the Cajal body. We show that <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 make multiple interactions with core snoRNP proteins and biogenesis factors and that these interactions are often regulated by the presence of ATP. Furthermore, we demonstrate that <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 efficiently bridge interactions between the core box C/D proteins NOP 56 or NOP 58 and 15. 5 K. Our data imply that the snoRNP assembly factor NUFIP can regulate the interactions between <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 <b>and</b> the core box C/D proteins. We suggest that snoRNP assembly involves an intricate series of interactions that are mediated/regulated by bridging factors and chaperones...|$|R

25|$|Because of {{the very}} high power levels involved, large lamps are water-cooled. In those used in IMAX projectors, the {{electrode}} bodies are made from solid Invar <b>and</b> <b>tipped</b> with thoriated tungsten. An O-ring seals off the tube, so that the naked electrodes do not contact the water. In low power applications the electrodes are too cold for efficient electron emission and are not cooled; in high power applications an additional water cooling circuit for each electrode is necessary. To save costs, the water circuits are often not separated and the water needs to be deionized to make it electrically non-conductive, which, in turn, lets the quartz or some laser media dissolve into the water.|$|E
25|$|The {{album was}} {{produced}} by <b>and</b> <b>tipped</b> for a United States release with Jay-Z's entertainment company Roc Nation, but this was later disputed by the group which claimed that Roc Nation was only signed to serve as A, {{as well as to}} produce Sweet 7. The involvement of Roc Nation's in-house producers gave the album a strong electro and dance-pop sound due to work from US producers and writers, mainly Fernando Garibay, Stargate and The Smeezingtons. Despite the high-profile input, Sweet 7 was negatively received by critics, which was awarded a 39 out of 100 according to aggregated reviews at Metacritic. The negative reviews stemmed to the originality of the image due to the loss of Buchanan, as well as a lack of an identifiable sound and soul from the project.|$|E
25|$|Away to Chelsea in {{the fifth}} round, despite {{starting}} without King, Žigić and N'Daw and losing Carr to injury after only 12 minutes, Birmingham opened the scoring when the defence failed to deal with Mutch's corner and Murphy shot firmly home. Two minutes later, Elliott tripped Ramires to concede a penalty, taken by Juan Mata <b>and</b> <b>tipped</b> onto the post by Doyle. In the second half, Chelsea equalised with a Daniel Sturridge header, and Redmond failed to convert a late chance to secure an unlikely victory. Under interim manager Roberto Di Matteo, after André Villas-Boas' dismissal, Chelsea won the replay, but they were made to fight by a weakened Birmingham side motivated by Žigić, who was angered by a facial gash courtesy of David Luiz's boot. Mata scored a scrambled goal soon after half-time, and Raul Meireles doubled the lead with a rising shot from , but Doyle again saved a penalty from Mata to restrict the winning margin to two goals.|$|E

25|$|The {{representatives of}} the Dutch Republic, England, and Spain signed the treaty on 20 September 1697. Emperor Leopold I, desperate for a {{continuation}} of the war so as to strengthen his own claims to the Spanish succession, initially resisted the treaty, but because he was still at war with the Turks, and could not face fighting France alone, he also sought terms and signed on 30 October. The Emperor's finances were in a bad state, and the dissatisfaction aroused by the raising of Hanover to electoral rank had impaired Leopold I's influence in Germany. The Protestant princes had also blamed him for the religious clause in the treaty, which stipulated that the lands of the Reunions that France was to surrender would remain Catholic, even those that had been forcibly converted—a clear defiance of the Westphalia settlement. However, the Emperor had netted an enormous accretion of power: Leopold I's son, Joseph, had been named King of the Romans (1690), and the Emperor's candidate for the Polish throne, August of Saxony, had carried the day over Louis XIV's candidate, the Prince of Conti. Additionally, Prince Eugene of Savoy's decisive victory over the Ottoman Turks at the Battle of Zenta – leading to the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699 – consolidated the Austrian Habsburgs <b>and</b> <b>tipped</b> the European balance of power in favour of the Emperor.|$|E

He then faced Juan Mónaco in the third round, their third meeting in a row, with Ferrero prevailing in the other two. He was upset, 6–7(2–7), 6–3, 3–6, in a match that lasted over three hours. At the Sony Ericsson Open, he made the round of 16, losing to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, 2–6, 2–6, after defeating John Isner, 6–2, 3–6, 6–3, and Daniel Köllerer, 4–0 RET. At the Monte Carlo Masters, he defeated Marcel Granollers, 6–0, 6–3, and Benjamin Becker, 6–3, 6–4. After defeating the German, Ferrero upset Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, 6–1, 3–6, 7–5, earning his first victory over the Frenchman. He, however, lost to Rafael Nadal, 4–6, 2–6, in the quarterfinals. At the Barcelona Open, Ferrero was upset by Dutchman Thiemo de Bakker in the third round, due to not playing well in the tie-breaks, 6–7(2–7), 6–3, 6–7(4–7),. At the Rome Masters, his form worsened as he surprisingly slumped to a 0–6, 3–6 loss to qualifier Santiago Giraldo in the first round. Ferrero went into the French Open seeded 16th <b>and</b> <b>tipped</b> by some to make a good run in the tournament. He defeated Pablo Cuevas of Uruguay in the first round, 6–4, 6–3, 6–1.

After coming back from a two-set deficit and being a break of serve up in the decider, Ferrero lost in the fifth set with a final score of 7–5, 6–3, 3–6, 2–6, 6–4. He may have been seen to have underachieved in the tournament but did improve on his previous year's performance and did therefore increase his ranking points.|$|E
