5|$|Analysis of {{the flawed}} images {{showed that the}} cause of the problem was that the primary mirror had been {{polished}} to the wrong shape. Although it was probably the most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, <b>a</b> <b>flaw</b> <b>in</b> which light reflecting off the edge of a mirror focuses on a different point from the light reflecting off its center.|$|E
5|$|In October 2017, it was {{reported}} that <b>a</b> <b>flaw</b> <b>in</b> a code library developed by Infineon, which had been in widespread use in security products such as smartcards and TPMs, enabled private keys to be inferred from public keys. This could allow an attacker to bypass BitLocker encryption when an affected TPM chip is used. Microsoft released an updated version of the firmware for Infineon TPM chips that fixes the flaw via Windows Update.|$|E

Past the 7th cave, to the east of hill is a dry pond, with large artificial boulders and Buddhist cisterns along its banks. At the end of the north spur of the main hill is a mound that resembles a Buddhist stupa. This, states Michell and Dhavalikar, may be the remains of a much higher Buddhist stupa from about 2nd century BCE.|$|E
5|$|The report {{suggests}} two hypotheses for the accident. In the first, {{there was}} <b>a</b> <b>flaw</b> <b>in</b> the power {{control of the}} plane's engines, which would have kept one of the thrust levers into acceleration, regardless of their actual position. In such circumstances, there was mechanical failure of the aircraft. However, the occurrence of this failure is one in 400 billion hours of flight and therefore highly improbable. In the second hypothesis, the pilot has performed a procedure different from that provided in the manual, and put the thrust lever in an irregular position, a configuration of human error for the accident.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{not known}} when Marshall began {{studying}} law, nor who his tutor was, he was practicing as early as 1785. In that year, he discovered <b>a</b> <b>flaw</b> <b>in</b> the original 1774 survey of the town of Frankfort. Due to the flaw, several choice acres of land {{in the northern part of}} Frankfort remained unclaimed, and Marshall quickly entered claims for them at the land office. Marshall also gained membership in the Kentucky Society for Promoting Useful Knowledge, a Danville-based society dedicated to disseminating information to farmers, mechanics, and other common citizens. He apparently was not accepted for membership in the Danville Political Club, although some sources report that he was accepted as a member after initially being rejected.|$|E

5|$|Privacy Control can warn users when sending {{confidential}} information. It {{can also}} be configured to block the transmission. It allows users to specify how the information can sent, such as via IM or e-mail. Item-specific exceptions allow users to control where there data can be sent. However, PC Pro found <b>a</b> <b>flaw</b> <b>in</b> the information filtering feature. The way information is formatted {{on the list of}} confidential information can affect its effectiveness. For example, entering the last six digits of a credit card number will not stop the numbers from leaking if they are grouped in four digits. PC Magazine also noted the fact anyone who can login to the computer can view the database of private information. For that reason, Symantec recommends entering only the last portion of sensitive information.|$|E
5|$|On 15 September 1940, {{three weeks}} after commissioning, Bismarck left Hamburg to begin sea trials in Kiel Bay. Sperrbrecher 13 escorted the ship to Arcona on 28 September, {{and then on to}} Gotenhafen for trials in the Gulf of Danzig. The ship's power-plant was given a {{thorough}} workout; Bismarck made measured-mile and high speed runs. As the ship's stability and manoeuvrability were being tested, <b>a</b> <b>flaw</b> <b>in</b> her design was discovered. When attempting to steer the ship solely through altering propeller revolutions, the crew learned that Bismarck could be kept on course only with great difficulty. Even with the outboard screws running at full power in opposite directions, they generated only a slight turning ability. Bismarcks main battery guns were first test-fired in late November. The tests proved she was a very stable gun platform. Trials lasted until December; Bismarck returned to Hamburg, arriving on 9 December, for minor alterations and the completion of the fitting-out process.|$|E
