5000|$|In power {{turbines}} like reaction turbines, Kaplan turbines, or Francis turbines, a diffuser tube {{is installed}} at the exit of the runner, known as draft tube. [...] In an impulse turbine the available head is high {{and there is no}} significant effect on the efficiency if the turbine is placed a couple of meters above the tail race. But in the case of reaction turbines, if the net head is low and if the turbine is installed above the tail race, there can be appreciable loss in <b>available</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>head.</b> If the pressure at the exit of the turbine is lower than the pressure of fluid in the tail race, a back flow of liquid into the turbine can result in significant damage. By placing a diffusing pipe at the exit of the runner, the pressure head is increased by decreasing the exit velocity, and both the overall efficiency and the output of the turbine can be improved.|$|E
40|$|This paper compares {{different}} recently proposed {{methods for}} pressure-driven snapshot simulations of water distribution networks using the EPANET software interface and proposes a new one. The proposed method {{is based on}} the insertion of a sequence of devices consisting of a General Purpose Valve (GPV), a fictitious junction, a reach with a check valve and a reservoir at each water demand node. The proposed method differs from other methods previously proposed in the literature – and similarly based on the insertion of sequences of devices consisting of a valve and a reservoir or emitter – in that it uses a GPV; more specifically, for this valve the user can fix the relationship between outflow discharge (or the flow delivered to users) and the <b>available</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> at the node, thus allowing for a flexible representation of the relationship between these two parameters, whereas with the other methods this relationship remains fixed, based on the structure of the sequence of devices used. Practical applications to three different real-life cases show the unreliability and limits, in terms of accuracy, of some of the methods previously proposed in the literature. They also show, by contrast, the validity of the new method, which has proven to be reliable and accurate, as well as flexible, since it enables any relationship to be defined between the delivered flow and available head...|$|E

[...] The {{formulae}} {{which give}} the thrust theoretically obtainable {{in a system}} where the ejector exhaust is mixed with the engine cooling air are of considerable mathematical complexity, {{and it is not}} therefore evident under what conditions the greatest benefit can be obtained from such a system. By considering a special case, it is shown that there is an optimum size of the mixing duct in relation to the exhaust-pipe diameter; and also that the effect of mixing the exhaust gas and cooling air streams is only beneficial when the <b>available</b> total <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> behind the engine is small. 1. Introduction. [...] It is well known that the reaction thrust obtainable from a jet of gas can be considerably increased by the provision of a mixing tube into which a secondary air stream is induced. With the relatively small amount of momentum available in the exhaust gas from a reciprocating engine, the possible gain by fitting secondary tubes to the exhaust pipes would be inconsiderable, and would not pay for the increased aerodynamic drag...|$|R

5000|$|Each coil of {{the tube}} helps {{increase}} the <b>available</b> <b>head</b> <b>pressure,</b> effectively increasing how high the water can be pumped. Successive coils are wound such that their outer diameter is slightly less than the inner diameter of the previous coil as the tubing spirals in. The diameter of the coil is {{much larger than the}} diameter {{of the tube}}, so the diameter of each additional coil decreases only a small amount. Due to the alternating water and air that is taken into the tubing the pressure of the previous coil gets added to the pressure in each coil. If the coils are about the diameter of the wheel the apparatus will pump water to a height of approximately the coil diameter multiplied by the number of coils. As an example 3 coils that average 4 meters in diameter could pump water up to about 12 meters above the water surface. [...] At the outlet there will be alternating water then compressed air coming out of the water tubing.|$|R

Improvement of 10 % in <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> was shown comparing with two-stage system; it was however shown a decrease of 5.9 % comparing flow rate in four- and two-stage system.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{operating}} <b>pressure</b> <b>heads</b> on water application uniformity in microirrigation submain units was evaluated. Research {{results show that}} water application uniformity either increases or slightly decreases as operating <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> increases in a range when the emission exponent x {{less than or equal}} to 0. 5 in most cases. The water application uniformity decreases as operating <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> increases in a range when the emission exponent x > 0. 5. The relationship between operating <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> and average emitter discharge in submain units can be considered as approximately linear for operating <b>pressure</b> <b>heads</b> in a small range (usually between the allowable minimum and maximum operating pressures of the submain units). These results help to estimate the average emitter discharge rate easily in a submain unit for an increased or decreased operating <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> when one is attempting to manage emitter discharge dynamically according to the requirements of crop root growth for different periods. Generally, a microirrigation system designed to meet the desired uniformity of water application according to the allowable minimum operating <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> would be better when x {{less than or equal to}} 0. 5 because water application uniformity increases as operating pressure increases if emitter discharges are being managed dynamically. However, a microirrigation system designed to meet the required water application uniformity according to the allowable maximum operating <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> would be better when x > 0. 5 because, in general, water application uniformity increases as operating pressure decreases...|$|R

40|$|In modeling, actual crop {{transpiration}} as {{a function}} of soil hydraulic conditions is usually estimated from a water content or <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> dependent reduction function. We compared the performance of the empirical <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> based reduction function of Feddes (FRF) and a more physically based reduction function using matric flux potential as the main parameter (DRF), both available in the SWAP ecohydrological model. Model performance was evaluated by comparison of SWAP predictions and observed water contents and <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> values in a field experiment with a common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) crop. For > 50 d, no rain occurred and the soil reached very dry conditions with <b>pressure</b> <b>heads</b> in the range - 100 to - 150 m.

Root water uptake distribution with time and depth simulated by SWAP showed very different patterns depending on the reduction function used. Root water uptake estimated by SWAP-FRF showed smooth transitions with time and between layers, whereas SWAP-DRF, highly sensitive to hydraulic conditions, generally predicted uptake to be concentrated at a few depths. The order of magnitude of the <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> difference between root xylem and root surface based on SWAP-DRF-predicted uptake rates, root length density, and reported values of root conductance was the same as the order of magnitude of the limiting root water <b>pressure</b> <b>head,</b> implying the necessity to include root hydraulic resistance in the DRF...|$|R

40|$|The {{linkage between}} root zone soil {{moisture}} and groundwater is either neglected or simplified in most land surface models. The fully-coupled subsurface-land surface model TerrSysMP including variably saturated groundwater dynamics {{is used in}} this work. We test and compare five data assimilation methodologies for assimilating groundwater level data via the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to improve root zone soil moisture estimation with TerrSysMP. Groundwater level data are assimilated {{in the form of}} <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> or soil moisture (set equal to porosity in the saturated zone) to update state vectors. In the five assimilation methodologies, the state vector contains either (i) <b>pressure</b> <b>head,</b> or (ii) log-transformed <b>pressure</b> <b>head,</b> or (iii) soil moisture, or (iv) <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> for the saturated zone only, or (v) a combination of <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> and soil moisture, <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> for the saturated zone and soil moisture for the unsaturated zone. These methodologies are evaluated in synthetic experiments which are performed for different climate conditions, soil types and plant functional types to simulate various root zone soil moisture distributions and groundwater levels. The results demonstrate that EnKF cannot properly handle strongly skewed pressure distributions which are caused by extreme negative <b>pressure</b> <b>heads</b> in the unsaturated zone during dry periods. This problem can only be alleviated by methodology (iii), (iv) and (v). The last approach gives the best results and avoids unphysical updates related to strongly skewed <b>pressure</b> <b>heads</b> in the unsaturated zone. If groundwater level data are assimilated by methodology (iii), EnKF fails to update the state vector containing the soil moisture values if for (almost) all the realizations the observation does not bring significant new information.

How the induction zone affects finger location and spacing is unknown. In the moist subsoil, fingers may well dissipate because the finger tips {{no longer have}} to overcome the water entry value. Both flow regions were investigated in a two-dimensional chamber with a fine-over-coarse glass bead porous medium. A capillary fringe was created by upward wetting through capillary rise. Upon ponding with dye-coloured water, fingers emerged, propagated downward and diverged when reaching the capillary fringe. Microtensiometers were installed in the induction zone, the fingers, and in the capillary fringe. In the induction zone, a lateral sinusoidal <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> developed within minutes.

To meet this crop yields demand, the associated dramatic improving of water productivity (WP) must necessarily be accompanied by maximization of water use efficiency (WUE) (Ragab 2011, UNEP 2014).

IrriLab is a very simple toll allows to design microirrigation unit optimizing WUE, pressure energy and irrigation unit costs.
