25|$|Selective inhibitors {{were used}} to {{determine}} the involved CYPs in the <b>aconitine</b> metabolism. The results indicate that <b>aconitine</b> was mainly metabolized by CYP3A4, 3A5 and 2D6. CYP2C8 and 2C9 had a minor role to the <b>aconitine</b> metabolism, whereas CYP1A2, 2E1 and 2C19 did not produce any <b>aconitine</b> metabolites at all. The proposed metabolic pathways of <b>aconitine</b> in human liver microsomes and the CYPs involved to it are summarized in the table above.|$|E
25|$|The {{antiarrhythmic}} drug lidocaine {{has been}} reported to be an effective treatment of <b>aconitine</b> poisoning of a patient. Considering the fact that <b>aconitine</b> acts as an agonist of the sodium channel receptor, antiarrhythmic agents which block the sodium channel (Vaughan-Williams' classification I) might be the first choice for the therapy of <b>aconitine</b> induced arrhythmias.|$|E
25|$|Animal {{experiments}} {{have shown that}} the mortality of <b>aconitine</b> is lowered by tetrodotoxin. The toxic effects of <b>aconitine</b> were attenuated by tetrodotoxin, probably due to their mutual antagonistic effect on excitable membranes.|$|E
25|$|Also paeoniflorin {{seems to}} have a detoxifying effect on the acute {{toxicity}} of <b>aconitine</b> in test animals. This may result from alternations of pharmacokinetic behavior of <b>aconitine</b> in the animals due to the pharmacokinetic interaction between <b>aconitine</b> and paeoniflorin. In addition, in emergencies, one can wash the stomach using either tannic acid or powdered charcoal. Heart stimulants such as strong coffee or caffeine may also help until professional help is available.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aconitine</b> is a toxin {{produced}} by the Aconitum plant, also known as devil’s helmet or monkshood. Monkshood is notorious for its toxic properties. In China, <b>aconitine</b> is also used in small doses as an analgesic and as a blood coagulant.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aconitine</b> is metabolized by {{cytochrome}} P450 isozymes (CYPs).|$|E
25|$|<b>Aconitine</b> binds to the {{receptor}} at the neurotoxin {{binding site}} 2 on the alpha-subunit {{of the channel}} protein. This binding results in a sodium-ion channel that stays open longer. <b>Aconitine</b> suppresses the conformational change in the sodium-ion channel from the active state to the inactive state. The membrane stays depolarized due to the constant sodium influx (which is 10-1000 fold greater than the potassium efflux). As a result, the membrane cannot be repolarized. The binding of <b>aconitine</b> to the channel also leads to the channel to change conformation from the inactive state to the active state at a more negative voltage.|$|E
25|$|Cleopatra VII of Egypt {{poisoned}} {{her brother}} Ptolemy XIV with <b>aconitine,</b> {{to put her}} son on the throne.|$|E
25|$|At higher {{concentration}} (0.3–3 µM) <b>aconitine</b> {{decreases the}} electrically evoked acetylcholine release, {{resulting in a}} decrease in muscle tension.|$|E
25|$|Biologically active {{isolates}} from Aconitum and Delphinium {{plants are}} classified as norditerpenoid alkaloids, which are further subdivided based on {{the presence or absence}} of the C18 carbonaconitum. <b>Aconitine</b> is a C19-norditerpenoid, based on its presence of this C18 carbonaconitum. It is barely soluble in water, but very soluble in organic solvents such as chloroform or diethyl ether. <b>Aconitine</b> is also soluble in mixtures of alcohol and water if the concentration of alcohol is high enough.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 Canadian actor Andre Noble {{died from}} <b>aconitine</b> poisoning. He accidentally ate some {{monkshood}} {{while he was}} on a hike with his aunt in Newfoundland.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aconitine</b> was {{previously}} {{used as an}} antipyretic and analgesic and still has some limited application in herbal medicine although the narrow therapeutic index makes calculating appropriate dosage difficult.|$|E
25|$|In neurons, <b>aconitine</b> {{increases}} the permeability of the membrane for sodium ions, {{resulting in a}} huge sodium influx in the axon terminal. As a result, the membrane depolarizes rapidly.|$|E
25|$|In 1953 <b>aconitine</b> {{was used}} by a Soviet {{biochemist}} and poison developer Grigory Mairanovsky in experiments with prisoners in the secret NKVD laboratory in Moscow. He admitted killing around 10 people using the poison.|$|E
25|$|Research with mouse nerve-hemidiaphragm muscle {{preparation}} {{indicate that}} at low concentrations (<0.1 µM) <b>aconitine</b> increases the electrically evoked acetylcholine release causing an induced muscle tension. Action potentials are generated more often at this concentration.|$|E
25|$|In 2009 Lakhvir Singh of Feltham, west London, used <b>aconitine</b> {{to poison}} {{the food of}} her ex-lover (who {{died as a result}} of the poisoning) and his current fiancée. Singh {{received}} a life sentence for the murder.|$|E
25|$|Progression of {{symptoms}}: {{the first}} symptoms of <b>aconitine</b> poisoning appear approximately 20 minutes to 2 hours after oral intake and include paraesthesia, sweating and nausea. This leads to severe vomiting, colicky diarrhea, intense pain and then paralysis of the skeletal muscles. Following {{the onset of}} life-threatening arrhythmia, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, death finally {{occurs as a result}} of respiratory paralysis or cardiac arrest.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aconitine</b> is {{naturally}} synthesized by the monkshood plant via the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway (MEP chloroplast pathway). Approximately 700 naturally occurring C19-diterpenoid alkaloids have been isolated and identified, but {{the synthesis of}} only a few of these alkaloids are well understood. In 1971, the Weisner group discovered the total synthesis of talatisamine (a C19-norditerpenoid). In the subsequent years, they also discovered the total syntheses of other C19-norditerpenoids, such as chasmanine, and 13-deoxydelphonine.|$|E
25|$|Reportedly {{the mixture}} was {{ground to a}} paste, boiled in water, and {{administered}} as a drink. After 2 to 4 hours the patient would become insensitive to pain and then lapse into unconsciousness. Depending on the dosage, they might remain unconscious for 6–24 hours. The active ingredients in tsūsensan were scopolamine, hyoscyamine, atropine, <b>aconitine</b> and angelicotoxin. When consumed in sufficient quantity, tsūsensan produced a state of general anesthesia and skeletal muscle paralysis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aconitine</b> can {{interact}} with the voltage-dependent sodium-ion channels, which are proteins in the cell membranes of excitable tissues, such as cardiac and skeletal muscles and neurons. These proteins are highly selective for sodium ions. They open very fast to depolarize the cell membrane potential, causing the upstroke of an action potential. Normally, the sodium channels close very rapidly, but the depolarization of the membrane potential causes the opening (activation) of potassium channels and potassium efflux, which results in repolarization of the membrane potential.|$|E
25|$|The {{whole family}} takes ill {{suddenly}} (apart from Bryan and Alexander {{who had gone}} away for a few days) and Alfred dies. Later, the curry made by Lucy on the fateful day is found to contain arsenic. Some days later, Harold, after returning home to London, receives a delivery of some tablets {{that appear to be}} the same as the sleeping pills prescribed to him by Dr. Quimper, who had told him he need not take them any more. The box they come in is actually the box for Emma's sedatives that were swapped for something else. They prove to be poisoned with <b>aconitine</b> and Harold dies.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Aconitine</b> was {{the poison}} used by George Henry Lamson in 1881 to murder his {{brother-in-law}} {{in order to}} secure an inheritance. [...] Lamson had learned about <b>aconitine</b> as a medical student from professor Robert Christison, who had taught that it was undetectable—but forensic science had improved since Lamson's student days.|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} {{research}} in 2011 in China to investigate in-depth the CYPs involved in <b>aconitine</b> metabolism in human liver microsomes. It {{has been estimated}} that more than 90 percent [...] of currently available human drug metabolism can be attributed to eight main enzymes (CYP 1A2, 2C9, 2C8, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4, 3A5). The researchers used recombinants of these eight different CYPs and incubated it with <b>aconitine.</b> To initiate the metabolism pathway the presence of NADPH was needed.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Aconitine</b> is {{very toxic}} due to several {{reactive}} groups. The nitrogen {{in one of}} the six-membered ring structure can easily form salts and ions. This turns the molecule into a structure with high binding affinity for polar and lipophilic structures (such as cell membranes and receptors) and makes it possible for the molecule to pass the blood-brain barrier. The acetoxyl group at the c8 position can readily be replaced by a methoxy group, by heating <b>aconitine</b> in methanol, to produce a 8-deacetyl-8-o-methyl derivatives. If <b>aconitine</b> is heated in its dry state, it undergoes a pyrolysis to form pyroaconitine((1α,3α,6α,14α,16β)-20-Ethyl-3,13-dihydroxy-1,6,16-trimethoxy-4-(methoxymethyl)-15-oxoaconitan-14-yl benzoate) with the chemical formula C32H43NO9.-Diterpenoid Alkaloids |vauthors=Pelletier SW, Mody NV | title = The Alkaloids: Chemistry and Physiology | volume = 17 | year = 1979 | page = 4 | doi = 10.1016/S1876-0813(08)60296-1 | url = https://books.google.com/books?hl=en==NTXlVrG0oIcC=fnd=PA4 }} ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Aconitine</b> (referred to as aconite, a {{derivative}} {{of the plant}} aconitum, monkshood devil's helmet, wolfsbane or women's bane) poisoning {{plays a key role}} in the murder mystery [...] "Breakdown" [...] by Jonathan Kellerman (2016).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Aconitine</b> {{was also}} {{made famous by}} its use in Oscar Wilde's 1891 story [...] "Lord Arthur Savile's Crime". [...] Aconite also plays a {{prominent}} role in James Joyce's Ulysses, in which the protagonist Leopold Bloom's father used pastilles of the chemical to commit suicide.|$|E
2500|$|The toxic {{effects of}} <b>aconitine</b> {{have been tested}} {{in a variety of}} animals, {{including}} mammals (dog, cat, guinea pig, mouse, rat and rabbit), frogs and pigeons. Depending on the route of exposure, the observed toxic effects were: local anesthetic effect, diarrhea, convulsions, arrhythmias or death.|$|E
2500|$|The active {{ingredients}} in tsūsensan are scopolamine, hyoscyamine, atropine, <b>aconitine</b> and angelicotoxin. When consumed in sufficient quantity, tsūsensan produces {{a state of}} general anesthesia and skeletal muscle paralysis. Shutei Nakagawa (1773–1850), {{a close friend of}} Hanaoka, wrote a small pamphlet titled [...] "Mayaku-ko" [...] ("narcotic powder") in 1796. Although the original manuscript was lost in a fire in 1867, this brochure described the current state of Hanaoka's research on general anesthesia.|$|E
2500|$|During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, a British {{detachment}} {{were the}} subject of attempted poisoning with <b>aconitine</b> by the Indian regimental chefs. The plot was thwarted by John Nicholson who, having detected the plot, interrupted the British officers {{just as they were}} about to consume the poisoned meal. The chefs refused to taste their own preparation, whereupon it was force fed to a monkey who [...] "expired on the spot". The chefs were hanged.|$|E
2500|$|... police-detectives. He {{then added}} a second dose of arsenic to Alfred's tea. When he {{poisoned}} Harold, {{he used the}} box that held Emma's sedative tablets and swapped them for <b>aconitine</b> tablets which killed Harold. Miss Marple then tells Mrs. McGillicuddy and Inspector Craddock that old Mr. Crackenthorpe may die soon, that Emma will get over the doctor, and that there will soon be wedding bells for Lucy - though she refuses to be drawn on {{the identity of the}} groom. Television adaptations have interpreted Lucy as choosing either Bryan Eastley or Inspector Craddock (though Craddock is revealed to be unmarried in a later novel, making Bryan the most likely choice).|$|E
6000|$|... "Unfortunately, yes; he {{made use}} of <b>aconitine</b> for that {{otherwise}} laudable purpose. Now, as ill luck would have it"--Mayfield's wrinkles deepened--"Yorke-Bannerman and Sebastian, then two rising doctors engaged in physiological researches together, had just been occupied in experimenting upon this very drug--testing the use of <b>aconitine.</b> Indeed, you will no doubt remember"--he crossed his fat hands again comfortably--"it was these precise researches on a then little-known poison that first brought Sebastian prominently before the public. What was the consequence?" [...] His smooth, persuasive voice flowed on as if I were a concentrated jury. [...] "The Admiral grew rapidly worse, and insisted upon calling in a second opinion. No doubt he didn't like the <b>aconitine</b> {{when it came to}} the pinch--for it DOES pinch, I can tell you--and repented him of his evil. Yorke-Bannerman suggested Sebastian as the second opinion; the uncle acquiesced; Sebastian was called in, and, of course, being fresh from his researches, immediately recognised the symptoms of <b>aconitine</b> poisoning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know the}} sequel. I was called in, and {{suddenly}} found that I had Bannerman in my power. There {{had been a}} very keen rivalry between us in science. He was {{the only man in}} England whose career might impinge upon mine. I had this supreme chance of putting him out of my way. He could not deny that he had been giving his uncle <b>aconitine.</b> I could prove that his uncle had died of <b>aconitine.</b> He could not himself account for the facts--he was absolutely in my power. I did not wish him to be condemned, Maisie. I only hoped that he would leave the court discredited and ruined. I give you my word that my evidence would have saved him from the scaffold." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{should like}} to take it now,' said Lady Clementina, holding {{up to the light}} the little {{transparent}} capsule, with its floating bubble of liquid <b>aconitine.</b> I am sure it is delicious. The fact is that, though I hate doctors, I love medicines. However, I'll keep it till my next attack.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not give}} the Admiral any more <b>aconitine</b> after I {{had taken over the}} case. But what was already in his system was enough. It was evident that we had seriously under-estimated the lethal dose. As to your father, Maisie, you have done me an injustice. You have always thought that I killed him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the first}} place, I {{must tell you}} that both Dr. Bannerman and myself were engaged at the time in an {{investigation}} upon the nature and properties of the vegetable alkaloids, and especially of <b>aconitine.</b> We hoped for the very greatest results from this drug, and we were both equally enthusiastic in our research. Especially, we had reason to believe that it might have a most successful action {{in the case of a}} certain rare but deadly disease, into the nature of which I need not enter. Reasoning by analogy, we were convinced that we had a certain cure for this particular ailment.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{had another}} resource. Bannerman's {{prescriptions}} were {{made up by}} a fellow named Barclay, who had been dispenser at Nathaniel's and afterwards set up as a chemist in Sackville Street. This man was absolutely in my power. I had discovered him at Nathaniel's in dishonest practices, and I held evidence which would have sent him to gaol. I held this over him now, and I made him, unknown to Bannerman, increase the doses of <b>aconitine</b> in the medicine until they were sufficient for my experimental purposes. I will not enter into figures, but suffice it that Bannerman was giving more than ten times what he imagined.|$|E
