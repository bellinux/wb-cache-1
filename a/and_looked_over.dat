5|$|In {{creating}} original music, Shimomura {{wanted to}} create compositions that would make players feel good while playing to accompany the action aspect of Kingdom Hearts. She played the game <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> scripts and illustrations for inspiration. After coming up with ideas, she discussed them with director Tetsuya Nomura and the game planners. For the PlayStation 2 re-release of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, she and her team spent {{much of their time}} working on the fight music; Shimomura wanted the different fight music to reflect different emotions such as happiness and sadness. To handle the large workload for Kingdom Hearts coded, Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days and Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, Shimomura composed the most prominent themes, while the rest was created by other composers. In retrospect, Shimomura has stated that the Kingdom Hearts series combined the scenes and music well, and she felt very honored her music has entered into people's hearts. She has also commented that she enjoyed working on the project, despite its hardships, and is proud of the work.|$|E

A woman went to the building, and when she lifted her arms and {{opened the door to the}} building [...] "light was shed from her arms over both sky and sea, and all worlds were made bright by her". In punishment for [...] "his great presumption" [...] in having sat in the holy seat, Freyr went away filled with grief.|$|E
500|$|The {{first major}} {{decision}} confronting the new district, which unlike other engineer districts had no geographic limits, was {{the choice of}} construction site. On 30 June Nichols and Marshall set out for Tennessee, where they met with officials of the Tennessee Valley Authority <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> prospective sites {{in the foothills of}} the Cumberland Mountains that had been identified (by scouts from the Office of Scientific Research and Development) as possessing the desirable attributes of abundant electric power, water and transportation with sparse population. A site at Oak Ridge, Tennessee was chosen, but Marshall delayed purchase while he awaited [...] scientific results that justified a full-scale plant. Afterwards, Nichols visited the Metallurgical Laboratory, or [...] "Met Lab", at the University of Chicago, where he met with Arthur Compton. Seeing the problems of overcrowding there, Nichols, on his own authority, arranged for a new experimental site to be established in the Argonne Forest which would eventually become the Argonne National Laboratory.|$|E
