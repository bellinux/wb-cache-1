Baits were applied on baiting lanes in sunflower fields {{with an electric}} seeder mounted on an all-terrain cycle. Three noncommercial (decoy) sunflower fields were baited with CAT-treated baits diluted 1 : 9 with similar mixture of untreated bait {{at a rate of}} 50 lbs/lane acre (9. 3 total treated acres). Based on total bait consumption, the estimate of blackbirds killed by the CAT treatment ranged from 13, 266 to 30, 650. The total amount of CAT-treated mixed bait consumed was 62. 1 pounds. The predominant species causing damage in the test fields was the red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) Overall, redwings constituted an average of 73 % of all birds observed in test fields, yellow-headed blackbirds (Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus) 23 %, and common grackles (Quiscalus quiscula) 4 %. Peak number of blackbirds feeding in test fields during observation periods varied from 2, 250 to 10, 635. Peak roost counts for roosts near test fields ranged from 60, 000 to 90, 000 blackbirds. Baits treated with an <b>acutely</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>pesticide</b> were evaluated as part of the bait mix and singly on sunflower rows as a toxicmarker. Birds and small mammals did not become immobilized and die close to ingestion sites. These results precluded the use of this toxic marker baits for estimating the number of birds accepting CAT baits. This technique does not appear promising as a technique for reducing local populations and associated sunflower loss...|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} example of {{environmental}} injustice among Latinos is {{the exposure to}} pesticides faced by farmworkers. After DDT and other chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides were banned in the United States in 1972, farmers began using more <b>acutely</b> <b>toxic</b> organophosphate <b>pesticides</b> such as parathion. A large portion of farmworkers in the US are working as undocumented immigrants, {{and as a result}} of their political disadvantage, are not able to protest against regular exposure to pesticides or benefit from the protections of Federal laws. Exposure to chemical pesticides in the cotton industry also affects farmers in India and Uzbekistan. Banned throughout much of the rest of the world because of the potential threat to human health and the natural environment, Endosulfan is a highly toxic chemical, the safe use of which cannot be guaranteed in the many developing countries it is used in. Endosulfan, like DDT, is an organochlorine and persists in the environment long after it has killed the target pests, leaving a deadly legacy for people and wildlife.|$|R
40|$|Dichlorvos is an <b>acutely</b> <b>toxic</b> organophosphorous <b>pesticide</b> that {{is known}} as a {{classical}} acetylcholinesterase (AChE; EC 3. 1. 1. 7) inhibitor. Here, the brain AChE from the important Amazonian fish tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) was assayed in the presence of this insecticide and also of deltamethrin, a classical sodium and potassium channel inhibitor (negative control). Four tissue homogenates were analyzed in triplicate for AChE activity using acetylthiocholine as the substrate and 5, 5 '-dithiobis(2 -nitrobenzoic) acid (DTNB) as the color-developing agent. Each tissue homogenate represented pooled brains from five fish. The inhibitory effect of dichlorvos on AChE activities was determined at concentrations from 0. 001 to 10 ppm and compared to controls. This effect followed an exponential decay model (y = 9. 420 + 26. 192 e(-x/ 5. 380); r 2 = 0. 989), presenting IC 50 (the concentration of dichlorvos that is required for 50 % of AChE inhibition) of 0. 081 ppm (0. 368 umol/L). No effect was observed for the deltamethrin, and the concentration 0. 0452 umol/L of dichlorvos was significantly different from this control. These results suggest that tambaqui brain AChE can be proposed as a biomarker for dichlorvos and {{can be used as a}} tool for aquatic environment monitoring. 200...|$|R
40|$|Background : Atrazine is an {{agricultural}} herbicide used extensively in corn production worldwide. Atrazine is an endocrine disruptor {{and has been}} linked to many other deleterious health outcomes. Exposure assessment studies have been carried out in Iowa among farm and non-farm populations. However, commercial pesticide applicators have been left out of those studies. Atrazine is also used in developing countries in grain production. In developing countries there is great concern about acute pesticide poisonings, but chronic exposure to less <b>acutely</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>pesticides</b> has not been studied extensively. This study assessed the in-home contamination of atrazine among commercial pesticide applicators in Iowa and then quantitatively analyzed these results with results from similar studies. Occupational inhalation exposure to atrazine was also assessed in Honduras. Methods : Dust samples were taken from 29 commercial pesticide applicator households in four different locations. This sampling was done once during the atrazine application season and again six months later during winter months to assess atrazine persistence. Occupational and household characteristics were analyzed for associations with atrazine dust levels. Data from two previous studies that analyzed farm and non-farm household dust samples for atrazine were combined with data from the commercial applicator 2 ̆ 7 s homes. This new and larger dataset was analyzed to identify which population has the greatest risk for take-home atrazine exposure and what determinants were associated with in-home atrazine dust levels. Lastly, corn production practices in Honduras were evaluated and personal air samples were taken from pesticide applicators during atrazine application to assess inhalation exposure. Results : The first study found that atrazine levels persist into the winter months in the homes of commercial applicators. Atrazine handling (days, pounds, and acres sprayed) were all positively associated with in-home atrazine levels. Commercial applicators that change their shoes inside had higher atrazine levels. More frequent floor cleaning was associated with lower atrazine levels. The second study identified commercial applicators 2 ̆ 7 homes as the most contaminated compared with farmers who apply atrazine to their own land, farmers who hire out atrazine application, and non-farm homes. Farmers that apply their own atrazine also had significantly higher atrazine levels in their homes. The association between atrazine handling and household atrazine levels was highly significant in this study (p 3 ̆c 0. 001). In Honduras, atrazine is applied to corn fields with tractor/boom equipment and manual backpack sprayers. Despite applying about one-fifteenth the amount of atrazine, backpack sprayers are exposed to nearly equal amounts of atrazine via inhalation exposure and likely have greater exposure via the dermal route. Among backpack sprayers, which type of spray nozzle used is associated with inhalation exposure. Among tractor/boom applicators, tractor drivers have much lower inhalation exposure than workers who operate and observe the boom. Conclusions : The amount of atrazine handled is the most important determinant for predicting in-home atrazine levels in Iowa. Ubiquitous atrazine contamination and its distribution within homes and among household type provide strong evidence for the take-home pathway. While some improvements have been made in Honduras regarding pesticide application, poor farm workers and small farmers still use antiquated pesticide application techniques which leads to a higher risk of inhalation and dermal exposure...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the capacity of decolorization and detoxification of the textile dyes Reactive Red 198 (RR 198), Reactive Blue 214 (RB 214), Reactive Blue 21 (RB 21) and the mixture of the three dyes (MXD) by Penicillium simplicissimum INCQS 40211. The dye RB 21, a phthalocyanine, was totally decolorized in 2 days, and the others, the monoazo RR 198, the diazo RB 214 and MXD were decolorized after 7 days by P. simplicissimum. Initially the dye decolorization involved dye adsorption by the biomass followed by degradation. The acute toxicity after fungal treatment was monitored with the microcrustacean Daphnia pulex and measured through Effective Concentration 50 % (EC 50). P. simplicissimum reduced efficiently the toxicity of RB 21 from moderately <b>acutely</b> <b>toxic</b> to minor <b>acutely</b> <b>toxic</b> and it also reduced the toxicity of RB 214 and MXD, which remained minor <b>acutely</b> <b>toxic.</b> Nevertheless, the fungus increased the toxicity of RR 198 despite of the reduction of MXD toxicity, which included this dye. Thus, P. simplicissimum INCQS 40211 was efficient to decolorize different textile dyes and the mixture of them with a significant reduction of their toxicity.
