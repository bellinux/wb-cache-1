Although this was publicly praised as an act of sportsmanship on Steinitz's part, Steinitz may have desperately needed the money.|$|E

50|$|This same naming {{convention}} for sidings is {{followed in the}} American rules for railroad operation. The General Code of Operating Rules Seventh Edition effective April 1, 2015 defines <b>a</b> <b>siding</b> as “A track connected to the main track and used for meeting or passing trains. Location of sidings are shown in the timetable.” The definition is interesting in that it appears to attach a single purpose to <b>a</b> <b>siding</b> and {{makes no mention of}} other possibilities such as the storage of rail cars or equipment on <b>a</b> <b>siding.</b> Like their Canadian counterparts, there also is no assigned number of main track switch connections in this definition of <b>a</b> <b>siding.</b>|$|R

5|$|As built, both ships {{also carried}} 21 /51 caliber guns arrayed ten to <b>a</b> <b>side</b> with {{one in the}} stern, {{primarily}} for defense against destroyers and torpedo boats. Many of the 5-inch guns were poor in accuracy in rough seas due to being mounted near {{the ends of the}} ship and below the main deck. The ships were not designed with anti-aircraft (AA) defense in mind, and with the development of naval aviation, this was seen as a serious drawback to the class. The New York class was the first US battleship to mount anti-aircraft guns, with two /50 caliber guns mounted on platforms on top of the boat cranes of Texas in 1916. In 1918, the secondary armament was reduced to 16 5-inch/51 caliber guns, eight to <b>a</b> <b>side,</b> as the guns near the ends of the ship were difficult to work in any kind of sea. When both ships were refitted 1925-26, AA defense was increased with eight 3-inch/50 caliber guns arrayed four to <b>a</b> <b>side.</b> Six of the 16 remaining 5-inch guns were relocated higher in the ship to new casemates on the main deck. The New York class also initially featured four torpedo tubes, 1 each on the port side bow and stern and starboard bow and stern, for the Bliss-Leavitt Mark 3 torpedo, instead of the previous two, because of advances in torpedo performance increasing the prominence of the weapon. The torpedo rooms held 12 torpedoes total, plus 12 naval defense mines. However, the torpedo tubes were removed in the 1925-26 refit.|$|E

The Roma management appointed Luis Enrique, who had previous coached the Barcelona B side, in a bid to emulate Barcelona's football style.|$|E

Originally {{there was a}} {{turntable}} behind the second platform which was used during {{the building of the}} tunnel under Enniscorthy town but was also used afterwards due to heavy traffic on Market Day. There was once an engine shed opposite the present day goods shed, two water columns were {{at each end of the}} platforms and there was also <b>a</b> very long <b>siding</b> for loading cattle. There were also a number of sidings, including <b>a</b> <b>siding</b> for O'Donahoes behind the station building, <b>a</b> <b>siding</b> for Buttles Bacon Factory which is now the site of the Enniscorthy Swimming Pool, <b>a</b> <b>siding</b> at the entrance of the tunnel for Roches and another siding that went under Barrack Street via a tunnel to Minch Norton.

5000|$|In early Canadian Pacific Railway {{employee}} timetable editions, {{the capacity}} of <b>a</b> <b>siding</b> was not shown.

Originally made from whole, sliced onions, they were reformulated into a formed product made from onion paste in 2001 as part of a menu revamp. In the same 2001 menu revamp, the company added an onion ring-specific dipping sauce, and emphasized it again during its 99¢ BK Value Menu introduction in 2002. As part of its BK Cravers value menu introduction in 2005, the company briefly sold jalapeño poppers accompanied by <b>a</b> <b>side</b> of ranch dressing as part of its national menu.
