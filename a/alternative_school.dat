5|$|The Albany Free School is {{the oldest}} independent, inner-city <b>alternative</b> <b>school</b> in the United States. Founded by Mary Leue in 1969 based on the English Summerhill School philosophy, the free school lets {{students}} learn at their own pace. It has no grades, tests, or firm schedule: students design their own daily plans for learning. The school is self-governed through a weekly, democratic all-school meeting run by students in Robert's Rules. Students and staff alike receive one equal vote apiece. Unlike Summerhill-style schools, the Albany Free School is a day school that serves predominantly working-class children. Nearly 80 percent of the school is eligible for reduced-price meals in the public schools. About 60 students {{between the ages of}} three and fourteen attend, and are staffed by six full-time teachers and a number of volunteers.|$|E

40|$|U. S. {{public schools}} {{systematically}} serve some student populations better than others. Higher expectations, more resources, more rigorous content and instruction, and priorities reflecting students' purposes for education support opportunity for some. Social unrest in the 1960 s reframed diverse education outcomes for students as inequity, {{a problem for}} democracy and civil rights. In that milieu, public secondary <b>alternative</b> <b>schools</b> emerged as innovative response to this socially articulated and shared problem in public education. In {{the first decade of}} the 21 st century, public secondary <b>alternative</b> <b>schools</b> (<b>alternative</b> <b>schools)</b> serve consistently around 2. 3 % of secondary students in the U. S., about 600, 000 students annually. Institutional theory predicts that innovative organizations in highly institutionalized sectors, like U. S. public education, will not persist as heterogeneous alternatives. Current models (Greenwood, Suddaby & Hinings, 2002) describe an institutional change path for innovation to either institutionalization, institutionalized organizations in a field adopt the innovative structures and practices, or extinction as fad or fashion. But, <b>alternative</b> <b>schools</b> have persisted as heterogeneous alternatives for more than forty years. This study addresses the question, "what about the role of public <b>alternative</b> <b>schools</b> allows them to persist as peripheral heterogeneous organizations in the institutionalized field of U. S. public secondary schools?" A mixed methods approach to this study allows inquiry and analysis into multiple levels of the institutional dynamics: 1) an analysis of the history of <b>alternative</b> <b>schools,</b> as organizations that evolve to address unmet priorities for changing populations underserved by traditional <b>school</b> organizations, connects <b>alternative</b> structures and practices to stakeholders' alternative priorities for these schools; 2) a longitudinal analysis, of National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) demographic and resource data, describes trends in differences between traditional and <b>alternative</b> secondary <b>schools</b> in the U. S. and makes the case that <b>alternative</b> <b>schools</b> engage in their work with different student populations and different levels of resources; and, 3) two case studies explain work that is understood as important for different stakeholders in two, different type <b>alternative</b> <b>schools.</b> The accounts of that work legitimate school structures and practices, and the schools themselves. Findings trace <b>alternative</b> <b>schools</b> as innovation through the Stages of Institutional Change (Suddaby, et al., 2002) arguing for a third path of persistence for alternative heterogeneous organizations in institutionalized environments. <b>Alternative</b> <b>schools</b> address diverse priorities for public education in the U. S.; serve high-needs populations of students in much higher concentrations than regular schools and with fewer resources; and these schools may need to maintain their heterogeneity to effectively address the priorities of local constituent groups. <b>Alternative</b> <b>schools</b> stabilize the field by serving as safety net for students and as a pressure valve for public <b>schooling.</b> I. e., <b>alternative</b> <b>schools</b> address technical and normative problems in public education that require a response from constituencies significant enough to demand, at least, a persistent marginalized solution. 2019 - 05 - 2...|$|R
