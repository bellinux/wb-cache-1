5|$|By this time, the fortifications {{had fallen}} into {{disrepair}} because the Swedish command did not pay much <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> territories, and funds that were allotted for renovation were insignificant. In addition, the forts at Nöteborg and Nyenskans were considered sufficient to provide defense for the region. In 1702, however, some repairs were completed {{under the supervision of}} Captain L. Stobecks.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} renewed {{interest}} in Nepenthes worldwide. Much of the plants' current popularity can probably be attributed to Shigeo Kurata, whose book Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu (1976), which featured the best colour photography of Nepenthes to date, did much to bring <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> unusual plants.|$|E
5|$|Verses 1–10 of chapter 8 {{elaborate}} on the practice of Dharana or meditation to train the mind in {{the consciousness of the}} self. The five elements in the universe correspond to five body functional systems, and that systems are gods residing within the human body. The next level of meditation is to fix one's undistracted <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> five, while simultaneously performing the breath exercises mastered in the previous step.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{deal with}} the issues which concern discriminations in textbooks. In America, they have paid special <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> {{problems}} since 1960 's. They made guidelines for textbooks to check various kinds of discriminative descriptions {{and tried to make}} textbooks <b>to</b> meet <b>these</b> standards. In this respects I would examine the present states about textbooks in America and would compare them to the Japanese ones. That would be useful, I believe, when we consider these issues in Japan...|$|R
50|$|In contrast, the Black Sea Fleet was {{bringing}} in reinforcements {{in spite of}} the Luftwaffe. On 12 June the cruiser Molotov and destroyer Bditel'nyy brought in 2,314 soldiers, 190 tons of ammunition and 28 artillery pieces. The Luftwaffe turned its <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> convoys. On 13 June it sank the transports Gruzyia, TSch-27, patrol boat SKA-092, motor boat SP-40, five barges and a floating crane. On 15 June another 3,400 soldiers, 442 tons of ammunition, 30 tons of fuel and 12 tons of provisions reinforced the Soviet positions.|$|R

25|$|Though López García {{is devoted}} to the mundane—he depicts humble people, buildings, plants, and {{cluttered}} interiors—his portrayal of these subjects is compelling and beautiful. Starkly lit studies of his studio, bathroom, and the red brick wall in his backyard underscore an interest in prosaic subject matter. His deftness brings <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> simple forms, encouraging the viewer to re-examine the presence of ordinary objects.|$|E
25|$|During Monday 31 March, {{there were}} {{spontaneous}} gatherings of sailors, {{during which they}} discovered the pay review, shipboard conditions, and the ineffectiveness of the lower-deck committees.

25|$|His satirical works {{depict the}} second world, {{in which human}} flaws are caricatured {{with little regard for}} actual or {{historical}} truth. Though critics call <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> anachronisms and narrative inconsistencies, it's possible that Vicente considered these errors trivial in his portrayals of an already false and imperfect world. In contrast, his representations of the mythic, symbolic, and religious aspects of Christmas, such as the figure of the Virgin Mother, the infant Jesus, and Christmas eve, demonstrate a harmony and purity which is not present in his social commentary.|$|E
25|$|The nose-gear light {{indicators}} {{were designed}} to be fail safe by having two separate light bulbs. This proved to be inadequate, as {{it was impossible to}} look through the cover to check whether one of the bulbs had been compromised, meaning that a failure of one bulb would not be detected until both bulbs malfunctioned. The first bulb was thus presumed to have gone inoperative some time before the day of the flight, while the second bulb broke during Flight 933. The NTSB therefore advised the Federal Aviation Administration to articulate means to avoid similar compromised fail-safe designs in the future. Both pilots had minimum-descent altitude light warnings, which were presumed to have given a visual warning, but because of the work overload, neither pilot directed his <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> alerts.|$|E

500|$|An {{important}} GR innovation, later {{adopted by}} Pinyin, {{was to use}} contrasting unvoiced/voiced pairs of consonants from Latin to represent aspirated and unaspirated sounds in Chinese. For example b and p represent [...] and [...] (p and p‘ in Wade). [...] Another distinctive feature of GR {{is the use of}} j, ch, and sh to represent two different series of sounds. When followed by i these letters correspond to the alveolo-palatal sounds [...] (Pinyin j, q, and x); otherwise they correspond to the retroflex sounds (Pinyin zh, ch, and sh). Readers used to Pinyin need to pay particular <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> spellings: for example, GR ju, jiu, and jiou correspond to Pinyin zhu, ju, and jiu respectively.|$|E
500|$|The Barrack-Room Ballads, as {{the name}} suggests, are songs of soldiers. Written by Kipling, they share a form and a style with {{traditional}} Army songs. Kipling {{was one of the}} first to pay <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> works; Charles Carrington noted that in contrast to the songs of sailors, [...] "no-one had thought of collecting genuine soldiers' songs, and when Kipling wrote in this traditional style it was not recognised as traditional". Kipling himself was fond of singing his poetry, of writing it to fit the rhythm of a particular tune. In this specific case, the musical source has been suggested as the Army's [...] "grotesque bawdy song" [...] Barnacle Bill the Sailor, but it is possible that some other popular tune of the period was used.|$|E
500|$|The {{right of}} {{assembly}} was originally {{distinguished from the}} right to petition. In United States v. Cruikshank (1875), the Supreme Court held that [...] "the {{right of the people}} peaceably to assemble for the purpose of petitioning Congress for a redress of grievances, or for anything else connected with the powers or duties of the National Government, is an attribute of national citizenship, and, as such, under protection of, and guaranteed by, the United States. The very idea of a government, republican in form, implies a right on the part of its citizens to meet peaceably for consultation in respect to public affairs and to petition for a redress of grievances." [...] Justice Morrison Waite's opinion for the Court carefully distinguished the right to peaceably assemble as a secondary right, while the right to petition was labeled to be a primary right. Later cases, however, paid less <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> distinctions.|$|E

500|$|According to {{observations}} by Kerry Carrington and Andrew Johnson, media {{references to}} Leigh being sexually assaulted [...] "almost completely disappeared" [...] {{in less than}} a year, as did the references to her being assaulted by the group of boys. They stated that the fact that NC1 was not charged with raping Leigh had created the legal fiction that his sex with her was consensual. The [...] "unsustainable assumption" [...] that Leigh consented to sex was the turning point in her being blamed for her own assault and murder on the grounds that, because she was supposedly sexually promiscuous, Leigh had somehow [...] "asked for [...] ". In addition to sexual promiscuity and the lack of parental supervision, Carrington states that media attention also shifted to the presence of drugs and alcohol at the party; Morrow and San Roque credit media <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> factors as taking attention away from the abuse that Leigh suffered before she died.

500|$|After the game's release, Hubbard {{identified}} the realistic expectations {{set by the}} team as a strong point in the game's development, saying that [...] "given our budget, team size, and development cycle, {{the best we could}} hope to do was to create a fun, engaging 60s espionage game that would make up in presentation what it lacked in innovation." [...] Other positive aspects of the process included the aforementioned mission statement, along with the flexible systems used in development, the cohesion of the team, and effective scheduling. On the other hand, Hubbard cited difficulties in fleshing out the final team, as well as inefficient pre-production, delays due to waiting on technology, and the major difficulties in finding a publisher. Hubbard also mentioned the cinematic cutscenes as lengthy and problematic, partly because of technical difficulties, and partly because of conceptual flaws on his behalf, with regard to screenwriting. Regarding gameplay, he said that [...] "ne of the main failings of NOLF [...] was that it ended up feeling a lot more scripted and linear than it was intended to be". Hubbard also expressed dissatisfaction with the balance between action and intrigue: [...] "Unfortunately, we came up a little short on intrigue. Stealth was too unforgiving. Once you were spotted, you were playing an action game." [...] The team paid <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> points while developing No One Lives Forever 2.|$|E

50|$|Much of {{the news}} media tended to {{minimize}} peaceful protests, however, and gave greater <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> arrests. <b>These</b> included controversial police actions of Friday evening, after the G20 Summit and the organized protests had ended.

2500|$|With the {{discovery}} of new species and Sir Joseph Banks' original introduction of specimens to Europe in 1789, interest in Nepenthes grew throughout the 19th century, culminating {{in what has been}} called the [...] "Golden Age of Nepenthes" [...] in the 1880s. However, the popularity of the plants dwindled in the early 20th century, before all but disappearing by World War II. This is evidenced by the fact that no new species were described between 1940 and 1966. The revival of global interest in the cultivation and study of Nepenthes is credited to Japanese botanist Shigeo Kurata, whose work in the 1960s and 1970s did much to bring <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> plants.|$|E
