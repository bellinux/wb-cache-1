30|$|The {{second point}} on the list - Specifying the unit of {{deliberate}} practice in developing entrepreneurial expertise – provides the strongest theoretical justification for the present paper.

His anxiety to learn, practise and become a great artiste was intense leading to his spreading the net for <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>expertise</b> far and wide. He attracted the attention of Manpoondia Pillai, the illustrious percussionist from Pudukottai and went with him to Tirunelveli where he was given special orientation in 'laya'. The training gave his rendition a lop-sided slant to laya to the detriment of sweet, balanced music. The lure of laya leads the musicians to over-indulgence and exhibitionist acrobatics to the detriment of melody and depth. As a friend, Tirukodikaval Krishna Ayyar is credited with bringing Vaidyanatha Ayyar back to the glorious path of balanced rendition.

40|$|This article uses a {{critical}} evaluation {{of research on}} student misconceptions in science and mathematics to articulate a constructivist view of learning in which student conceptions play productive roles in the <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>expertise.</b> We acknowledge and build on the empirical results of misconceptions research but question accompanying views of the character, origins, and growth of students’ conceptions. Students have often been seen as holding flawed ideas, which are strongly held, interfere with learning, and which instruction must confront and replace. We argue that this view overemphasizes the discontinuity between students and expert scientists and mathematicians, making the <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>expertise</b> difficult to conceptualize. It also conflicts with the basic premise of constructivism, that students build more advanced knowledge from prior understandings. Using case analyses we dispute some commonly cited dimensions of discontinuity and identify important continuities that have been previously ignored or underemphasized. We highlight elements of knowledge that serve both novices and experts, albeit in different contexts, and under different conditions. We provide an initial sketch a constructivist theory of learning that interprets students ’ prior conceptions as resources for cognitive growth within a “complex systems ” view of knowledge. This theoretical perspective aims to characterize the interrelationships among diverse knowledge elements rather than identify particular flawed conceptions; itMisconceptions Reconceived 3 emphasizes knowledge refinement and reorganization, rather than replacement, as primary metaphors for learning; and it provides a framework for understanding misconceptions as both flawed an...|$|E
