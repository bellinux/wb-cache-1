5|$|F-16E/F: The F-16E (single seat) and F-16F (two seat) are newer F-16 variants. The Block 60 {{version is}} based on the F-16C/D Block 50/52 and has been {{developed}} especially for the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It features improved AN/APG-80 <b>active</b> <b>electronically</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>array</b> (AESA) radar, avionics, conformal fuel tanks (CFTs), and the more powerful General Electric F110-GE-132 engine.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the older AN/MPQ-53 Passive Electronically Scanned Array (PESA) radar set of the MIM-104 Patriot PAC-2, the Green Pine is an <b>active</b> <b>electronically</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>array</b> (AESA) solid state radar. Unlike the advanced AN/TPY-2 X band radar of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, Green Pine operates at L band - in the range 500 MHz to 1,000MHz, or 1,000MHz to 2,000MHz.|$|E
5|$|The F-16E/F is {{outfitted}} with Northrop Grumman's AN/APG-80 <b>active</b> <b>electronically</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>array</b> (AESA) radar. Northrop Grumman developed the latest AESA radar upgrade for the F-16 (selected for USAF and Taiwan Air Force F-16 upgrades), named the Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR). In July 2007, Raytheon {{announced that it}} was developing a Next Generation Radar (RANGR) based on its earlier AN/APG-79 AESA radar as a competitor to Northrop Grumman's AN/APG-68 and AN/APG-80 for the F-16.|$|E

5|$|F-16V: At the 2012 Singapore Air Show Lockheed Martin {{unveiled}} {{plans for}} the new F-16V variant with the V suffix for its Viper nickname. It is to feature an <b>active</b> <b>electronically</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>array</b> (AESA) radar, a new mission computer and electronic warfare suite, and various cockpit improvements; this package is an option on current production F-16s and can be retrofitted to most in service F-16s.

5|$|The Northrop Grumman E-10 MC2A {{was to be}} a 767-400ER-based {{replacement}} for the USAF's 707-based E-3 Sentry AWACS, Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint STARS, and RC-135 SIGINT aircraft. The E-10 MC2A would have included an all-new AWACS system, with a powerful <b>active</b> <b>electronically</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>array</b> (AESA) that was also capable of jamming enemy aircraft or missiles. One 767-400ER aircraft was produced as a testbed for systems integration, but the program was terminated in January 2009 and the prototype was sold to Bahrain as a VIP transport.|$|E
5|$|The {{centerpiece}} of the Nike-X system was MAR, using the then-new <b>active</b> <b>electronically</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>array</b> (AESA) concept {{to allow it to}} generate multiple virtual radar beams, simulating any number of mechanical radars needed. While one beam scanned the sky for new targets, others were formed to examine the threat tubes and generate high-quality tracking information very early in the engagement. More beams were formed to track the RVs once picked out, and still more to track the Sprints {{on their way to the}} interceptions. To make all of this work, MAR required data processing capabilities on an unprecedented level, so Bell proposed building the system using the newly invented resistor–transistor logic small-scale integrated circuits. Nike-X centralized the battle control systems at their Defense Centers, consisting of a MAR and its associated underground Defense Center Data Processing System (DCDPS).|$|E
5000|$|Adaptive arrays can be {{a single}} antenna with active {{elements}} or an array of similar antennas with ability to change their combined radiation pattern as different conditions persist. <b>Active</b> <b>electronically</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>arrays</b> (AESAs) manipulate phase shifters and attenuators at the face of each radiating site to provide a near instantaneous scan ability as well as pattern and polarization control. This is especially beneficial for radar applications since it affords a single antenna the ability to switch among several different modes such as searching, tracking, mapping and jamming countermeasures.|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>active</b> <b>electronically</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>arrays</b> (AESAs) further evolved this process. In a PESA the broadcast signal {{is a single}} frequency, although that frequency can be easily changed from pulse to pulse. In the AESA, each element is driven at a different frequency (or at least {{a wide selection of}} them) even within a single pulse, so there is no high-power signal at any given frequency. The radar unit knows which frequencies were broadcast, and amplifies and combines only those return signals, thereby reconstructing a single powerful echo on reception. An adversary, unaware of which frequencies are active, has no signal to see, making detection on radar warning receivers extremely difficult.|$|R
40|$|In the UMS GH 25 - 10 GaN MMIC {{technology}} a Cband {{high power}} amplifier (HPA) has been realized. The current design is primarily {{intended for use}} in a space-based SAR system with a center frequency of 5. 4 GHz and a sweep bandwidth of 100 MHz. To enable reuse of the amplifier in other radar systems such as weather radar, a large bandwidth is required. A design bandwidth from 5 to 6 GHz has been used. Simulation and measurement data from on-wafer and mounted samples will be shown. Showing more than 50 W output power with 45 % efficiency the HPA shows sufficient performance to be used in a module for state-of-the-art <b>active</b> <b>electronically</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>arrays.</b> The measured output power and efficiency are a record for MMIC amplifiers. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{synthesis}} of the optimal excitations of the sum and the difference patterns in planar <b>active</b> <b>electronically</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>arrays</b> (AESAs) for side-looking airborne monopulse radar systems is addressed. Under the assumption that each array element {{is equipped with a}} single transmit receive module (TRM), which is shared among all patterns, the complex (amplitude and phase) TRM coefficients are optimized with a customized convex programming procedure to yield a sum beam with maximum directivity and difference beams with maximum slope along the boresight direction as well as asymmetric sidelobes envelope for noise suppression from half-space. Representative results from a synthesized AESA devoted to a real airborne application are illustrated and discussed to give some insights to the interested readers on the features and the potentialities of the proposed synthesis approach...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the benefits and challenges of using gallium nitride (GaN) based components in next generation transmit/receive (T/R) modules for <b>active</b> <b>electronically</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>arrays</b> (AESAs). GaN is particularly well-suited for high power amplifiers (HPAs) in transmit and may be considered for limiters and low noise amplifiers (LNAs) in the receive path. Higher radiated power per element increases the range while the cost per radiated watt can be lower. Higher radiated power per element can also reduce antenna size (area/module count) for fixed range performance. GaN’s higher drain voltage results in improved efficiencies at the next higher level assembly in the array by reducing the amount of copper conductors in the assembly. Higher voltage operation also reduces current requirements on dc/dc converters that are used throughout the array. Challenges in using GaN include its perceived lack of maturity and cost...|$|R
