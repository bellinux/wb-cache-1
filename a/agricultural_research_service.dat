25|$|Palm oil, {{a natural}} oil {{extracted}} from the fruit of oil palm trees that is semi-solid at room temperature (15–25 degrees Celsius), can potentially serve {{as a substitute for}} partially hydrogenated fats in baking and processed food applications, although there is disagreement about whether replacing partially hydrogenated fats with palm oil confers any health benefits. A 2006 study supported by the National Institutes of Health and the USDA <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Service</b> concluded that palm oil is not a safe substitute for partially hydrogenated fats (trans fats) in the food industry, because palm oil results in adverse changes in the blood concentrations of LDL and apolipoprotein B just as trans fat does.|$|E
25|$|Since 1998, the United States Department of Agriculture, <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Service</b> (ARS) has {{experimented with}} using the fungus Myrothecium verrucaria as a biologically based {{herbicide}} against kudzu.

Initial formulations of the herbicide produced toxic levels of other trichothecenes as byproducts, though the ARS discovered growing M. verrucaria in a fermenter on a liquid, instead of a solid, diet limited or eliminated the problem.|$|E

25|$|Spinach is {{packaged}} in air, or in nitrogen gas to extend shelf life. Some packaged spinach {{is exposed to}} radiation to kill any harmful bacteria that {{may be on the}} leaves. The Food and Drug Administration approves of irradiation of spinach leaves up to 4.0 kilograys; however, using radiation to sanitize spinach is of concern because it may deplete the leaves of their nutritional value. Researchers at the <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Service</b> experimentally tested the concentrations of vitamins C, E, K, B9, and four carotenoids in packaged spinach following irradiation. They found with increasing level of irradiation, four nutrients showed little or no change. Those nutrients include vitamins B9, E, K, and the carotenoid neoxanthin. This study showed the irradiation of packaged spinach to have little or no change to the nutritional value of the crop, and the health benefits of irradiating packed spinach to reduce harmful bacteria seem to outweigh the loss of nutrients.|$|E

Strong winds will pick up loose sand and topsoil and hurl it through the air at speeds ranging from [...] to [...] Such windblown sand causes {{extensive}} damage to plant seedlings because it ruptures plant cells, making them vulnerable to evaporation and drought. Using a mechanical sandblaster in a laboratory setting, scientists affiliated with the <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Service</b> studied the effects of windblown sand abrasion on cotton seedlings. The study showed that the seedlings responded to the damage created by the windblown sand abrasion by shifting energy from stem and root growth to the growth and repair of the damaged stems.
