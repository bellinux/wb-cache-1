5|$|Immersion {{in water}} and {{exposure}} to cold water and high pressure have physiological effects on the diver which limit the depths <b>and</b> <b>duration</b> possible in ambient pressure diving. Breath-hold endurance is a severe limitation, and breathing at high ambient pressure adds further complications, both directly and indirectly. Technological solutions have been developed which can greatly extend depth <b>and</b> <b>duration</b> of human ambient pressure dives, and allow useful {{work to be done}} underwater.|$|E
5|$|Immersion {{in water}} and {{exposure}} to high ambient pressure have physiological effects that limit the depths <b>and</b> <b>duration</b> possible in ambient pressure diving. Humans are not physiologically and anatomically well adapted to the environmental conditions of diving, and various equipment has been developed to extend the depth <b>and</b> <b>duration</b> of human dives, and allow different types {{of work to be}} done.|$|E

5|$|Decompression {{which follows}} the {{procedure}} of relatively fast ascent interrupted by periods at constant depth {{is known as}} staged decompression. The ascent rate and the depth <b>and</b> <b>duration</b> of the stops are integral parts of the decompression process. The advantage of staged decompression {{is that it is}} far easier to monitor and control than continuous decompression.|$|E

As introduced in the following definition, the total number of time measures implied by a set of n events <b>and</b> the corresponding <b>durations</b> is n+m=n+n(n− 1)/ 2 =n(n+ 1)/ 2.|$|R

5|$|A diver {{missing a}} {{required}} decompression stop {{increases the risk}} of developing decompression sickness. The risk is related to the depth <b>and</b> <b>duration</b> of the missed stops. The usual causes for missing stops are: not having enough breathing gas to complete the stops, or accidentally losing control of buoyancy. An aim of most basic diver training is to prevent these two faults. There are also less predictable causes of missing decompression stops. Diving suit failure in cold water may force the diver to choose between hypothermia and decompression sickness. Diver injury or marine animal attack may also limit the duration of stops the diver is willing to carry out.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{males and}} most adult females start their pre-winter moult before {{returning}} south, but complete most feather replacement on the wintering grounds. In Kenya, males moult 3–4 weeks {{ahead of the}} females, finishing before December, whereas females typically complete feather replacement during December and early January. Juveniles moult from their first summer body plumage into winter plumage during late September to November, and later undergo a pre-breeding moult similar in timing <b>and</b> <b>duration</b> {{to that of the}} adults, and often producing as brightly coloured an appearance.|$|E

5|$|As one on an {{official}} mission, Wright {{would probably have}} offered greetings to Leopold's ambassador extraordinary in London, the Marqués de Lede, and to Alonso de Cárdenas, the regular Habsburg ambassador, who had also been engaged since 1649 in art procurement for the Spanish Monarch. The lack of records means that the timing <b>and</b> <b>duration</b> of this visit remain uncertain. However, de Lede left in late June, and de Cárdenas {{a few weeks later}} – as relations between Cromwell and the Habsburgs deteriorated – so Wright probably arrived back in Flanders, with any acquisitions he had made, just in time to learn of the Archduke's impending departure – and that of his huge art collection – from Brussels in the autumn of 1655.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1960s, James E. Lloyd's {{investigation}} of female fireflies {{of the genus}} Photuris revealed they emit the same light signals that females of the genus Photinus use as a mating signal. Further research showed male fireflies from several different genera are attracted to these mimics, and are subsequently captured and eaten. Female signals are based on that received from the male, each female having a repertoire of signals matching the delay <b>and</b> <b>duration</b> of the female of the corresponding species. This mimicry may have evolved from non-mating signals that have become modified for predation.|$|E

5|$|Much {{research}} has been done into erection. By two years post-injury, 80% of men recover at least partial erectile function, though many experience problems with the reliability <b>and</b> <b>duration</b> of their erections if they do not use interventions to enhance them. Studies have found that half or up to 65% of men with SCI have orgasms, although the experience may feel different than it did before the injury. Most men say it feels weaker, and takes longer and more stimulation to achieve.|$|E
5|$|Outcome {{is related}} to the extent <b>and</b> <b>duration</b> of lead exposure. Effects of lead on the {{physiology}} of the kidneys and blood are generally reversible; its effects on the central nervous system are not. While peripheral effects in adults often go away when lead exposure ceases, evidence suggests that most of lead's effects on a child's central nervous system are irreversible. Children with lead poisoning may thus have adverse health, cognitive, and behavioral effects that follow them into adulthood.|$|E
5|$|Seven Halo soundtracks {{have been}} released. The Halo Original Soundtrack {{contains}} most of Combat Evolveds music. Due to the varying nature of gameplay, the music present {{was designed to}} use the game's dynamic audio playback engine. The engine allows for the mood, theme, <b>and</b> <b>duration</b> of music played to change according to gameplay. To afford a more enjoyable listening experience, O'Donnell rearranged portions of the music of Halo into standalone suites, which follow the narrative course of the game. The soundtrack also contains music not used in the game, including {{a variation on the}} Halo theme that was first played at Halos debut at Macworld 1999.|$|E
