25|$|The festival has {{striking}} {{similarities to}} Confucian and Neo-Confucian ideals, {{in that it}} deals with filial piety. It has been observed that the account of rescuing the mother in hell has helped Buddhism to integrate into Chinese society. At the time, due to the Buddhist emphasis on the renunciant life, Buddhism was criticized by Confucianists. They felt Buddhism went against the principle of filial piety, because Buddhist monks did not have offspring to make offerings for ancestor worship. Maudgalyāyana's account helped greatly to improve this problem, and has therefore been raised as a textbook example of the adaptive qualities of Buddhism. Other scholars have proposed, however, that the position of Buddhism in India versus China was not <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>different,</b> as Buddhism {{had to deal with}} the problem of filial piety and renunciation in India as well. Another impact the story of Maudgalyāyana's had was that, in East Asia, the account helped to shift the emphasis of filial piety towards the mother, and helped redefine motherhood and femininity.|$|E

[...] The Huffington Post said, [...] "previously it had been unfathomable that students in Baghdad might be experiencing the same ephemeral and narcissistic heartbreak as we are in the United States." [...] Farhi and Nicholls noticed that the Iraqi students do the same things as American high school students, such as listening to rap music, trying to study without distractions, playing sports, becoming stressed over their final exams and acting silly with their friends. Perigard commented, [...] "despite the cultural differences, Ali, Anmar, Hayder and Mohammad will seem instantly familiar to anyone who has spent time around a teenage boy.

[...] Andrew Lynch of entertainment.ie noted that [...] "lthough at times it [...] a little contrived, for the most part this is stylishly decadent music that should appeal to all fans of film noir." [...] The NME viewed the album as [...] "cold, desolate and old-fashioned" [...] and argued that Felt Mountain was not a [...] "bad concept" [...] except that [...] "Portishead got there first, and managed to update the spy-film vibe with a hefty dose of break-driven twilight melancholia." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although the {{simplest}} reflexes may be mediated by circuits lying entirely within the spinal cord, more complex responses rely on signal processing in the brain. For example, when {{an object in}} {{the periphery of the}} visual field moves, and a person looks toward it many stages of signal processing are initiated. [...] The initial sensory response, in the retina of the eye, and the final motor response, in the oculomotor nuclei of the brain stem, are not <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>different</b> from those in a simple reflex, but the intermediate stages are completely different. [...] Instead of a one or two step chain of processing, the visual signals pass through perhaps a dozen stages of integration, involving the thalamus, cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, superior colliculus, cerebellum, and several brainstem nuclei. [...] These areas perform signal-processing functions that include feature detection, perceptual analysis, memory recall, decision-making, and motor planning.|$|E
