40|$|This study {{presents}} an electromagnetically-actuated reciprocating pump for high-flow-rate microfluidic applications. The pump comprises four major components, namely a lower glass plate containing a copper microcoil, a middle PMMA plate incorporating a PDMS diaphragm with a surface-mounted magnet, upper PMMA channel plates, and a ball-type check valve {{located at the}} channel inlet. When an AC current is passed through the microcoil, an alternating electromagnetic force is established between the coil and the magnet.

40|$|In this thesis, a new {{piezoelectric}} {{valve system}} with bi-chevron aluminum nitride (AlN) actuator is described. The intended {{application of the}} new piezoelectric valve is for the advanced printing technology with supercritical carbon dioxide as the solvent. With supercritical carbon dioxide as the solvent, the ink dissolved will start to nucleate with a micronozzle and generate extremely small and uniform ink particles due to rapid expansion of supercritical solution (RESS). Therefore, {{the resolution of the}} printing can be improved and induce a much better printing quality. To successfully operate this new printing technology, the operation pressure of this valve system should be as high as 30 MPa. This operation pressure is much higher than what the current piezoelectric MEMS valve can offer. Aluminum nitride is chosen as the piezoelectric material over lead zirconate titanate (PZT) because the depolarization of PZT due to compressive stresses limits the operating pressure to less than 5 MPa. In order to meet high pressure requirements, thin-film AlN is selected because it doesn't experience compressive stress depolarization and is IC compatible. The piezoelectric valve system is designed with bi-chevron shape not only to amplify the generated stroke but also to reduce undesired out-of-plane motion. This amplification mechanism is achieved by the cantilever beam structure without increasing the size of the valve system significantly. In the bi-chevron, the use of piezoelectrics with matched sets of actuator arms enables a push-pull actuation in both directions and also reduces out-of-plane buckling. To verify the working function of the bi-chevron actuator, a pre-prototype device is introduced and fabricated. And the result from the static testing of the pre-prototype device is compared with the finite element simulation and the theoretical analysis. The result shows a good fitting between finite element simulation and the pre-prototype device measurement (maximum error is about 17 %). However, the error between the theoretical analysis and finite element simulation is significant due to the particle top/bottom electrode coverage. This is because partial-coverage results in a nonuniform electrical field along the width of the AlN beam and simultaneously reduces the generated stroke and the generated force. For the dynamic performance, an alternating current (AC) is used to actuate the pre-prototype device rather than direct current (DC). It is because AC <b>actuating</b> <b>voltage</b> gives the dynamic response of the pre-prototype device and then indicates the resonant frequency of the pre-prototype devices which corresponds to the operation speed while DC <b>actuating</b> <b>voltage</b> has no effect on the dynamic performance at all. The result of the dynamic performance shows that the prototype device will give 1. 5 micron in-plane generated stroke with acceptable out-of-plane generated stroke when the device is actuated in 60 kHz with 10 V <b>actuating</b> <b>voltage.</b> The pre-prototype device has 1100 micron long, 10 micron wide, and 2 ° angle AlN beams. In addition to the pre-prototype device, the prototype device is fabricated for the supercritical carbon dioxide valve system. The difference between prototype devices and supercritical carbon dioxide devices is that supercritical carbon dioxide devices have been sealed with a cap. That means the prototype devices can become goal devices, supercritical carbon dioxide valves, after sealing the device with a cap. This prototype device uses a SOI wafer with bi-chevron AlN actuator to control the flow of the supercritical carbon dioxide valve. This is prototype device is also evaluated and the result verify that this fabrication process is correct...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, some {{fundamental}} relationships for beams incorporating piezoelectric film actuators and sensors are examined. The differential {{equation of motion}} for a beam with piezoelectric film bonded to both sides is used to develop Laplace domain transfer function models of the system. These transfer functions are exact Laplace domain representations of the system equations of motion. The transfer functions are cast into a closed rational form using Maclaurin series expansions representing a specific number of modes. In this form, the transfer functions lend themselves to classical control analysis. It is shown that the transfer function relating a voltage applied to a full coverage actuating layer, to the voltage induced in a full coverage sensing layer on the opposite beam face, be-haves like a classic colocated system with alternating poles and zeros and accordingly the system is easy to stabilize with low order compensation. In contrast to this result, it is shown {{that in spite of}} the effective colocation of actuator and sensor {{in the case of the}} transfer function from <b>actuating</b> <b>voltage</b> to tip position, the desirable alternating pole/zero pattern is not exbibited due to incompatibility of actuating and sensing signals.

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the implementation of}} surface bonded piezoelectric actuators to control or minimize the deformation in elastic or viscoelastic cantilever beams due to simultaneous heat and moisture diffusion. The problem is addressed {{in the context of}} linearized elasticity and linearized viscoelasticity. The constitutive equations are derived from the balance laws for mass, linear and angular momenta, energy, entropy and the second law of thermodynamics. The constitutive equations for linearized elasticity are then obtained as a consequence of small deformation assumption. The temperature and moisture induced deformation is introduced through the coefficient of thermal expansion CTE and coefficient of moisture expansion CME. The constitutive equations for linearized viscoelasticity are obtained by correspondence principle. The coupled temperature and moisture diffusion equations are obtained as a consequence of Clausius-Duhem inequality. The extent of coupling between heat conduction and moisture diffusion phenomena is studied by varying the ratio of their diffusivities and a non-dimensional coupling parameter. The effect of coupled unsteady heat conduction and moisture diffusion phenomena on the short and long term response characteristics of the beam such as displacement, stress and strain fields is studied. Based on these response characteristics, the magnitude of external <b>actuating</b> <b>voltage</b> required to minimize deformation is predicted. This is followed by a comparative study of the field variables in cases of actuated and unactuated beams. Four materials are chosen for this study; aluminium, epoxy, carbon fiber reinforced polymer with fiber volume fraction of 60 percent, and an epoxy-like viscoelastic material. The viscoelastic material is assumed to be thermorheologically simple. The shift factor is assumed to be a linear function of temperature and moisture fields. To address this problem numerically, a finite difference formulation is presented for the field equations and boundary conditions. This numerical scheme is validated by solving the problem of uniformly loaded cantilever beam and comparing the results with the analytical solution known a priori. The results obtained numerically are validated by comparison with experimental results. It is observed that the under the effect of external actuation, the stress and displacement fields are largely minimized in all four cases chosen for study. The bending in the unactuated viscoelastic beam is more pronounced than bending in the unactuated elastic beam. This is due to the softening of the material with time due to evolving temperature and moisture fields. However, relatively lesser external <b>actuating</b> <b>voltage</b> is necessary to minimize bending in the former case compared to the latter. The magnitude of actuating electric field required in the piezoelectric layer suggests a need to address the problem with in a non-linear framework, no such attempt is made in this study...|$|E

40|$|Charged {{particle}} beam actuators such as particle accelerators and {{particle beam}} optics systems have wide applications in industry and academia, from medical and industrial diagnostics to investigations in fundamental science. This work details the preliminary {{efforts in the}} miniaturization of charged particle accelerators and manipulators to be highly compact and portable, by developing a toolbox of beam actuation components, which can be integrated for different applications. The three components that were developed are the electrostatic curved particle beam guide, a co-planar waveguide based RF resonator architecture for linear accelerators, and the Einzel lens for beam focusing. The central thesis is to use micro-fabrication techniques to attain micron precision in structures with 100 - 500 micron feature sizes, channels in which high electric fields (> 106 V/m) could be sustained to act upon charged particles. The use of electrostatic fields is feasible in many applications, {{eliminating the need for}} permanent magnets required in macro-scale charged particle systems. The micro-fabricated components utilizing electrostatic fields are realized on a planar substrate with the electrodes defined by micro-machined doped silicon or PCB copper, on a substrate such as silicon handle wafer or PCB dielectric. Within the planar implementation, the charged particle beam propagates in the plane of the substrate, with device sizes varying from 1 cm 2 chips to cell-phone dimensions. Micro-fabrication processes were developed to accommodate electrically isolated actuator patterning, as well as multilayer high aspect-ratio structures.

Their effects are investigated using finite element modelling, with the conclusions validated experimentally. The actuated needle was inserted into porcine tissue up to 30 mm depth and its visibility was observed under colour Doppler imaging. The piezoelectric transducer is able to generate longitudinal vibration with peak-to-peak amplitude up to 4 μm at the needle tip with an <b>actuating</b> <b>voltage</b> of 20 Vpp. Actuated in longitudinal vibration modes (distal mode at 27. 6 kHz and transducer mode at 42. 2 kHz) with a drive amplitude of 12 – 14 Vpp, a 120 mm needle is delineated as a coloured line in colour Doppler images, with both needle tip and shaft visualised. The improved needle visibility is maintained while the needle is advanced into the tissue, thus allowing tracking of the needle position in real time. Moreover, the needle tip is highlighted by strong coloured artefacts around the actuated needle generated by its flexural vibration. A limitation of the technique is that the transducer mode requires needles of specific lengths so that the needle’s resonance frequency matches the transducer. This may restrict the choice of needle lengths in clinical applications...|$|E
40|$|Transport of a {{water droplet}} on a solid surface can be {{achieved}} by differentially modifying the contact angles at either side of the droplet using capacitive charging of the solid-liquid interface (i. e., electrowetting-on-dielectric) to create a driving force. Improved droplet mobility {{can be achieved by}} modifying the surface topography to enhance the effects of a hydrophobic surface chemistry and so achieve an almost complete roll-up into a superhydrophobic droplet where the contact angle is greater than 150 degrees. When electrowetting is attempted on such a surface, an electrocapillary pressure arises which causes water penetration into the surface features and an irreversible conversion to a state in which the droplet loses its mobility. Irreversibility occurs because the surface tension of the liquid does not allow the liquid to retract from these fixed surface features on removal of the <b>actuating</b> <b>voltage.</b> In this work, we show that this irreversibility can be overcome by attaching the solid surface features to the liquid surface to create a liquid marble. The solid topographic surface features then become a conformable "skin" on the water droplet both enabling it to become highly mobile and providing a reversible liquid marble-on-solid system for electrowetting. In our system, hydrophobic silica particles and hydrophobic grains of lycopodium are used as the skin. In the region corresponding to the solid-marble contact area, the liquid marble {{can be viewed as a}} liquid droplet resting on the attached solid grains (or particles) in a manner similar to a superhydrophobic droplet resting upon posts fixed on a solid substrate. When a marble is placed on a flat solid surface and electrowetting performed it spreads but with the water remaining effectively suspended on the grains as it would if the system were a droplet of water on a surface consisting of solid posts. When the electrowetting voltage is removed, the surface tension of the water droplet causes it to ball up from the surface but carrying with it the conformable skin. A theoretical basis for this electrowetting of a liquid marble is developed using a surface free energy approach...|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} {{are used}} to store fuel to generate energy in fuel cell systems. In this regard, a nano-piping systems are needed to transfer and control the molecules of fuel flow, through the cell system. In this study a <b>voltage</b> <b>actuated</b> nano-valve system to control the molecule flow, has been presented which consists of a both ends fixed Single wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) and a ground plane. To show the function of presented nano-valve, both van der Waals between SWNT and the ground plane and electrostatic forces due to voltage inducement are considered. Induced voltage causes SWNT to deflect. When kink phenomenon happens due to SWNT deflection, the molecules path will be closed. In comparison to previous presented nano-valves, this nano-valve has better controlling features and faster and easier actuation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} delay time {{compensation}} method {{in the model}} predictive control (MPC) of induction motor (IM) at high and low speed considering the selection of optimum switching vector to <b>actuate</b> the three-phase <b>voltage</b> source inverter (VSI). The proposed control method compensates the delay time to improve {{the performance of the}} system, and consequently maintain the accurate tracking of the references at different speed regions. The control scheme utilizes the discrete nature of the system, and uses the possible switching vectors of the converter in an intuitive manner. Therefore, based on minimum quality function the optimum switching vector is selected for the next sampling time actuation of the power converter. The control scheme is validated through the MATLAB simulation and experimental validation in DS 1104 R&D Controller Platform. The simulation and experimental results prove the feasibility of the proposed method with encouraging performance...|$|R
