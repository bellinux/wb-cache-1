500|$|George Lucas {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the film (originally titled Munchkins) in 1972. Similar in intent to Star Wars, he created [...] "a number of well-known mythological situations for a young audience". During the production of Return of the Jedi in 1982, Lucas approached Warwick Davis, who was portraying Wicket the Ewok, about playing Willow Ufgood. Five years passed before he was actually cast in the role. Lucas [...] "thought {{it would be great to}} use a little person in a lead role. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> movies are about a little guy against the system, and this was just a more literal interpretation of that idea." ...|$|E

500|$|Biden {{declared}} his candidacy for president on January 31, 2007, {{although he had}} discussed running for months prior. It had been speculated that Biden would be offered and accept the position of Secretary of State because of his foreign policy experience and credentials. Biden rejected the notion outright, saying [...] "Under no administration will I accept the job of Secretary of State". He stated that he was focused only on the presidency. At a campaign event, Biden commented, [...] "I know <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> opponents out there say I'd be a great secretary of state. Seriously, every one of them. Do you watch any of the debates? 'Joe's right, Joe's right, Joe's right.'"

500|$|The lyrical themes on {{the album}} deal with issues of spirituality, morality, and self-examination. Vedder said, [...] "I think there's a little self-examination in those songs, {{something}} that <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> friends are going through too, as they approach 30." [...] Ament said, [...] "In some ways, it's like the band's story. It's about growing up." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Hail, Hail" [...] refer to two people in a troubled relationship struggling to hold it together.

He explained his position to the Western Daily Press, stating that the show's producers had made a number of changes to the series without consulting him, and that in the process Time Team had been [...] "dumbed down", something he considered bad for archaeology. He was annoyed that a number of archaeologists—including surveyor Stewart Ainsworth, small finds specialist Helen Geake and illustrator Victor Ambrus—had seen their roles diminished while a new co-presenter, Mary-Ann Ochota (a former model with a bachelor's degree in archaeology and anthropology), had been introduced, and that as a result the episodes now contained [...] "a lot of faffing about." [...] In an interview with the magazine British Archaeology Aston said: [...] "The time had come to leave.

500|$|Three {{months after}} the release of Goodbye Lullaby (2011), Lavigne {{announced}} that work on her fifth studio album had already begun, having eight songs written. Lavigne stated that the album would musically be the opposite of Goodbye Lullaby, with a release date rumoured for sometime in 2012. Lavigne explained, [...] "Goodbye Lullaby was more mellow, [...] the next one will be pop and more fun again. I already have a song that I know {{is going to be a}} single, I just need to re-record it!." [...] In an interview, Lavigne said about her collaboration with Kroeger: [...] "I have a song called Hello Kitty, which I wrote about Hello Kitty because I'm obsessed, and it's a really fun thing that I've never done before. It kind of has a kind of glitchy, electronic feel to it and it's... the only one on the record that sounds like that.

Following Mangold's noir and Spaghetti Western inspirations for the film, Beltrami explained, [...] "I think I do every movie as a western whether it is or not, so there’s definitely some of the spaghetti western influence on my music throughout the score, and I guess throughout <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> work. I wouldn’t say there was a particular movie that influenced me more than something else. There was nothing that I was trying to mimic or anything." [...] On associating sounds with the film's primary location, Beltrami said, [...] "I think the last thing that Jim [...] and I wanted to do was Japanese music associated with Japanese places. There's a reference; I do use Japanese instruments, [...] not really in a traditional way." [...] The score was performed by an 85-piece ensemble of the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th Century Fox.|$|E
500|$|Oakley and Weinstein stood down as showrunners after season eight {{because they}} [...] "didn't {{want to break}} [...] " [...] and Mike Scully took over as showrunner in 1997. As showrunner and {{executive}} producer, Scully said his aim was to [...] "not wreck the show", Scully was popular with the staff members, many of whom praised his organization and management skills. Writer Tom Martin said he was [...] "quite possibly the best boss I've ever worked for" [...] and [...] "a great manager of people" [...] while writer Don Payne commented that for Scully [...] "it was really important that we kept decent hours".

500|$|In late 2009, Docter {{noticed his}} pre-teen daughter, Elie, exhibiting similar shyness. [...] "She started getting more quiet and reserved, and that, frankly, {{triggered}} <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own insecurities and fears," [...] he said. He imagined {{what happens in}} the human mind when emotions set in. The idea to depict it through animation excited Docter, who felt it the ideal form to portray [...] "strong, opinionated, caricatured personalities." [...] He began researching information about the mind, alongside Jonas Rivera, a producer, and Ronnie del Carmen, a secondary director. They consulted Paul Ekman, a well-known psychologist who studies emotions, and Dacher Keltner, {{a professor of psychology at}} the University of California, Berkeley. Ekman had early in his career identified six core emotions—anger, fear, sadness, disgust, joy, and surprise. Docter found surprise and fear to be too similar, which left him with five emotions to build characters around. Other emotions considered for inclusion during the development process were schadenfreude, ennui, pride, and hope. Keltner focused on sadness being an emotion that strengthens relationships. Both emphasized how emotions organize social lives and the structuring of interpersonal interactions.|$|E
500|$|<b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{performances}} {{have had}} fire involved, {{so we thought}} 'Heat.' Also, red {{is one of my}} favorite colors, as is gold. So then we thought of making the bottle look like it's on fire. I love antique bottles — my mother had a collection of them when I was growing up. I wanted something with an antique yet modern feeling. Even with my wardrobe, I always try to find things that have a little bit of something vintage, yet still timeless and classic. The bottle, I felt, was a great mixture of the two... Everything, from the bottle design to the name and the ideas for the commercials–that's me. When I commit to something, I do it 100 percent, and I've never had [...] until this project. I learned a lot of great things from the past — but I always asked myself, 'If I could have my own scent, what would it be?' I wasn't worried about deadlines. It could have taken me three, four, however many years — this was my first fragrance, and I wanted to make sure that it was something I would love forever.|$|E
500|$|Like Amir, {{the protagonist}} of the novel, Hosseini was born in Afghanistan and left {{the country as a}} youth, not {{returning}} until 2003. Thus, he was frequently questioned about the extent of the autobiographical aspects of the book. In response, he said, [...] "When I say some of it is me, then people look unsatisfied. The parallels are pretty obvious, but... I left a few things ambiguous because I wanted to drive the book clubs crazy." [...] Having left the country {{around the time of the}} Soviet invasion, he felt a certain amount of survivor's guilt: [...] "Whenever I read stories about Afghanistan my reaction was always tinged with guilt. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> childhood friends had a very hard time. Some of our cousins died. One died in a fuel truck trying to escape Afghanistan [...] Talk about guilt. He was one of the kids I grew up with flying kites. His father was shot." [...] Regardless, he maintains that the plot is fictional. Later, when writing his second novel, A Thousand Splendid Suns (then titled Dreaming in Titanic City), Hosseini remarked that he was happy that the main characters were women as it [...] "should put the end to the autobiographical question once and for all".|$|E
