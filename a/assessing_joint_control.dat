40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} preliminary evaluation of a novel version of the robotic elbow exoskeleton NEUROExos, designed for the in-clinic treatment of stroke survivors in acute and subacute phases. The robotic design implements a novel series elastic actuation system, a 4 -degree-of-freedom (DoFs) passive mechanism for the anatomical axis alignment, and one active DoF with remote cable-driven actuation. The low-level control system allows two working modalities: a torque <b>control</b> and a <b>joint</b> position <b>control.</b> The high-level control system employs a finite-state machine that allows the setting and execution of these modalities during rehabilitation exercises. Preliminary pilot tests based on passive exercises, with three chronic post-stroke patients, demonstrated {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed approach in <b>assessing</b> <b>joint</b> rigidity and its usability within a rehabilitation clinic...|$|R

The effects of each procedure on delayed sequencing behavior were also tested. Ten undergraduate students participated in 2 experiments.

Finally, when the self-echoic mediation component was blocked, accurate responding deteriorated in 8 of 10 participants...|$|R
40|$|In our {{previous}} research, we experimentally implemented and evaluated {{the effect of}} dynamics compensation in model- based control algorithms.

While the former utilizes the complete dynamics model of the manipulator, the latter assumes a decoupled and linear model of the manipulator dynamics. We discuss the design of controller gains for both the computed-torque and the independent <b>joint</b> <b>control</b> schemes and establish a framework for comparing their trajectory tracking performance. Our experiments show that within each scheme the trajectory tracking accuracy varies slightly with the change of the sampling rate. However, at low sampling rates the computed-torque scheme outperforms the independent <b>joint</b> <b>control</b> scheme. 1...|$|R

This research investigates the effectiveness of <b>joint</b> <b>control</b> training in teaching selection responses and if self-echoic and tact skills alone will be sufficient in producing name-object responses. The experimenter taught children with autism how to echo, tact, and use these two skills jointly to emit correct selection behaviors. Subjects participated in a total of seven different steps that included baseline testing, naming training (self-echoic and tact training), generalization testing, and joint-control training. The finding demonstrated that echoic and tact training alone did not result in generalized selection response; it was only when the participants were taught to emit the two verbal responses (self-echoic and tact) jointly that the performance in selection manded behavior improved significantly...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{cooperative}} and communicative aspects of control over dynamic situations such as emergency management and military operations. Taking a stance in Cognitive Systems Engineering, Decision making and Communication studies, the role of information systems as tools for communication in dynamic situations is examined. Three research questions are examined; 1) How new forms of information technology affects <b>joint</b> <b>control</b> tasks in dynamic situations, and how/if microworld simulations {{can be used to}} investigate this. 2) What the characteristics of actual use of information systems for <b>joint</b> <b>control</b> are in dynamic situations? 3) What the pre-requisites are for efficient communication in <b>joint</b> <b>control</b> tasks and especially in dynamic, high-risk situations? Four papers are included. A study performed with a microworld simulation involving military officers as participants is presented, and the method of using microworlds for investigating the effects of new technology is discussed. Field observations from an emergency call centre are used to exemplify how information systems actually are used in a cooperative task. An interview study with military officers from a UN-mission describes the social aspects of human-human communication in a dynamic, high risk environment. Finally, an elaborated perspective on the role of information systems as tools for communication, and especially the relation between the social, organisational and technical layers of a <b>joint</b> <b>control</b> activity is presented...|$|R
