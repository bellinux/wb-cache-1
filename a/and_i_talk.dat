500|$|Even as {{a colonial}} pioneer, Crease {{clung to the}} aristocratic traditions of Britain. The Crease family's home in New Westminster was Ince Cottage, on Sapperton Road, named for the castle that belonged to Henry's mother's family in England. He sent his sons to Haileybury College in England for their schooling, and was dismayed to note that, [...] "While you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> of the Old Country as 'Home,' all our {{children}} call Canada 'home.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|My Papa knows you, {{and he says}} you're a man {{who makes}} reading for [...] books; [...] But I never read nothing you wrote, nor did Papa,--I know by his [...] looks. [...] So I guess you're like me when I talk, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> all [...] the day, [...] And they only say, [...] "Do stop that child!" [...] or, [...] "Nurse, take Miss Edith [...] away." ...|$|E
60|$|P.S.--Ward <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> {{of going}} to Holland. I {{want to see how}} a Dutch canal looks after the Bosphorus. Pray respond.|$|E
50|$|<b>And</b> you <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> of poetry.|$|R
60|$|Phelps <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> it over on our journey, {{but neither}} of us could devise a {{satisfactory}} reason for this new development.|$|R
60|$|George <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> for a {{time while}} the men smoked. He, from his glum stupidity, broke into a harsh, almost {{imbecile}} loquacity.|$|R
6000|$|... "He lied," [...] said Edith. [...] "When you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> {{about it}} together, {{we should tell}} the simple truth. We have pardoned him his lie;--but he lied." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} mind," [...] she said softly, [...] "that my brother <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> {{sometimes}} in our native language. You do not, by chance, know Portuguese, Mr. Chetwode?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit down, you bold, bad boy. Don't {{you see it}} is of {{business}} that you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> down here; and it is {{of business}} that ozzer people up stairs are thinking. Eh?" ...|$|E
60|$|Emily <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> {{on by the}} window, {{about books}} and people. She was {{intensely}} serious, and generally succeeded in reducing me to the same state.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is no Burnamy physically, or {{so far as}} I {{can make}} out, spiritually. She didn't mention him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> at least five minutes with her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr Davidson <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> it over, <b>and</b> we made up {{our minds}} {{the first thing}} to do was to put down the dancing. The natives were crazy about dancing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Tut! Let us {{have done}} with that. WE know very well how it was. Why should you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> about it, when you and I can't {{disguise}} it? To proceed. I am disappointed and cut a poor figure.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{has been}} most kind, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> like a brute. But I am liable to do worse--I give you notice. She won't like it any more than she did before, if she thinks I want to make up to you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|She had {{not time}} to say more, when the whole castle shook, and a rustling, hissing, groaning sound was heard. The girl quickly pushed Vassili into a chest under the bed, locked it and whispered: 'Listen to what the serpent <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> about.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Jackson was {{disappointed}} with her opponent, telling The Dispatch after her victory [...] "the senator <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> early about running positive campaigns. Unfortunately, his campaign {{ended up being}} about half-truths and half-statements." ...|$|R
6000|$|The captain laughed. [...] "It {{stands to}} reason that it might have been that way," [...] he said, [...] "but it wasn't. He stopped, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> to him for about five minutes." ...|$|R
6000|$|Along the Ferdinand Strasse Harris <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> about private lunatic asylums, which, Harris said, {{were not}} well managed in England. He said {{a friend of}} his, a patient in a lunatic asylum-- ...|$|R
60|$|I don't know that, Madam, said I, that's as {{you order}} it; by the Father's Side, said I, I {{know it will}} not, but what it may by the Mother's Side, that's a Doubt I can't resolve till the Devil <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> farther about it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, David," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "what else do {{you think}} your {{patients}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> of when I am trying to nurse them? It has agitated the town ever since you first walked up the Marrywellbrae, and we can't get on with our work for thinking of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{there is}} more," [...] he answered, {{advancing}} again. [...] "This time I {{can make the}} offer more attractive. Marry me, and Caryll is not only free to depart, but no evidence shall be laid against him. I swear it! Refuse me, and he hangs as surely--as surely as you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> together here this moment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jackson was {{disappointed}} with her opponent, telling The Dispatch after her victory [...] "the senator <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> early about running positive campaigns. [...] Unfortunately, his campaign {{ended up being}} about half-truths and half-statements." ...|$|R
60|$|They both spoke English excellently, {{nearly as}} well as they spoke French and German; and they bustled about and made him comfortable. At supper he sat next to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. <b>I</b> {{remember}} Levison <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> it over <b>and</b> said it {{was curious}} that a deed between Brander and Mr. Hartington {{should not have been}} given to us as usual to be drawn up." ...|$|R
60|$|Our eldest girl, who is {{very like}} her mother, married John Spatter's eldest son. Our two {{families}} are closely united in other ties of attachment. It is very pleasant of an evening, when we are all assembled together--which frequently happens--and when John <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> over old times, and the one interest {{there has always been}} between us.|$|E
6000|$|Now she's dead. They've got the paper—her paper—in {{the kitchen}} down there, and it's full of photographs, even an old photo of me—"an unfortunate misalliance." [...] I feel, somehow, as if I were {{at an end}} too. I thought I'd grown a solid, middle-aged-man, and here I feel sore as I did at twenty-six, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> as I used to.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] the man admitted, [...] "I try {{to teach}} them that much. They like it. You are an American? I am glad of it. I have 'most lost the use of my lungs, here. I'm a great talker, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> to my wife till she's about dead; then I'm out of {{it for the rest}} of the day; I can't speak German." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quincey <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> it over, but {{the more}} we talked, the more puzzled we got, till now I can say for myself that I'm about up a tree as to any meaning about anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I said that," [...] {{answered}} Joan. [...] "I {{wanted to}} do it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked,</b> so hard. <b>I</b> said everything I could think of. But that was the only answer: I mustn't do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{they know}} about you, and see you now and then, and Henry Tagalana <b>talked</b> to them, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> a little to them, and they asked me about our ways here, {{and they want to}} learn." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes--which {{of us is}} right," [...] cried MacIan violently. [...] "Oh, {{you have}} long words and I have long words; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> of every man being the image of God; and you talk of every man being a citizen and enlightened enough to govern. But if every man typifies God, there is God. If every man is an enlightened citizen, there is your enlightened citizen. The first man one meets is always man. Let us catch him up." ...|$|E
60|$|Not a day passes but Dolby <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> {{about you}} both, and recall {{where we were}} at the {{corresponding}} time of last year. My old likening of Boston to Edinburgh has been constantly revived within these last ten days. There is a certain remarkable similarity of tone between the two places. The audiences are curiously alike, except that the Edinburgh audience has a quicker sense of humour and is a little more genial. No disparagement to Boston in this, because I consider an Edinburgh audience perfect.|$|E
6000|$|... "But what {{a horrible}} thing!" [...] she exclaimed, drawing {{out a little}} mirror from the bag by her side and gazing into it. [...] "How {{unpleasant}} to have any one else going about with a mouth exactly like one's own! No, I never had a brother, Mr. Orden, or a sister, and, {{as you may have}} heard, I am an enfant mechante. I live in London, I model very well, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> very bad sociology. As I think I told you, I know your anarchist friend, Miles Furley." ...|$|E
50|$|Matthew <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> {{about the}} {{production}} on “Certainly Never” {{and he wanted}} a very room like, no frills sound for the song. At {{the time we were}} recording at Bearsville Recording Studio <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had access to the finest microphones and gear around.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hugh {{captured}} that Valborg boy up the track. They became {{such good}} friends. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> {{to him for}} a while. I'd heard he was eccentric, but really, I found him quite intelligent. Crude, but he reads--reads almost the way Dr. Westlake does." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No go," [...] she answered. [...] "I {{spent the}} {{evening in the}} club <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> with two men who knew Craig, but I couldn't get on to anything. From all I could hear of the man, respectability is his middle name." ...|$|R
