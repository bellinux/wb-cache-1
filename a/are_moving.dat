5|$|In 1912, Vesto Slipher made spectrographic {{studies of}} the {{brightest}} spiral nebulae to determine their composition. Slipher discovered that the spiral nebulae have high Doppler shifts, indicating that they <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> at a rate exceeding the velocity of the stars he had measured. He found {{that the majority of}} these nebulae <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> away from us.|$|E
5|$|It is {{important}} not to over-interpret these diagrams. Nothing is implied about how a particle gets from one point to another. The diagrams do not imply that the particles <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> in straight or curved lines. They do not imply that the particles <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> with constant speeds. The fact that the photon is often represented, by convention, by a wavy line and not a straight one does not imply that it is thought that it is more wavelike than is an electron. The images are just symbols to represent the actions above: photons and electrons do, somehow, move from point to point and electrons, somehow, emit and absorb photons. The theory does not explain how these things happen, but it does tell us the probabilities of these things happening in various situations.|$|E
5|$|Spiders {{maintain}} balance when walking, so that legs 1 and 3 on {{one side}} and 2 and 4 on the other side <b>are</b> <b>moving,</b> while the other four legs are on the surface. To run faster, spiders increase their stride frequency.|$|E

5|$|The rate {{of change}} in the {{distance}} between two objects in a frame of reference with respect to which both <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> (their closing speed) may have a value in excess ofc.

5|$|At present, {{the continents}} of North and South America <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> westward from Africa and Europe. Researchers have {{produced}} several scenarios {{about how this}} will continue in the future. These geodynamic models can be distinguished by the subduction flux, whereby the oceanic crust moves under a continent. In the introversion model, the younger, interior, Atlantic ocean becomes preferentially subducted and the current migration of North and South America is reversed. In the extroversion model, the older, exterior, Pacific ocean remains preferentially subducted and North and South America migrate toward eastern Asia.|$|E
5|$|Based on this star's {{kinematic}} properties, {{it appears}} {{to belong to a}} stellar association called the Castor Moving Group. However, Vega may be much older than this group, so the membership remains uncertain. This group contains about 16 stars, including Alpha Librae, Alpha Cephei, Castor, Fomalhaut and Vega. All members of the group <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> in nearly the same direction with similar space velocities. Membership in a moving group implies a common origin for these stars in an open cluster that has since become gravitationally unbound. The estimated age of this moving group is , and they have an average space velocity of 16.5km/s.|$|E

5|$|By {{repeated}} scanning, bats can mentally {{construct an}} accurate {{image of the}} environment in which they <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> and of their prey item. However, some species of moth have exploited this, such as the tiger moths which produces aposematic ultrasound signals to warn bats that they are chemically protected. Other moth species can produce signals to jam bat echolocation. Many moth species have a hearing organ called a tympanum, which responds to an incoming bat signal by causing the moth's flight muscles to twitch erratically, sending the moth into random evasive maneuvers.|$|E
5|$|Farmers exploit {{flocking}} {{behavior to}} keep sheep together on unfenced pastures such as hill farming, {{and to move}} them more easily. For this purpose shepherds may use herding dogs in this effort, with a highly bred herding ability. Sheep are food-oriented, and association of humans with regular feeding often results in sheep soliciting people for food. Those who <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> sheep may exploit this behavior by leading sheep with buckets of feed.|$|E

5|$|Munro also {{reported}} that, at the time, Rùm was highly forested, with {{an abundance of}} deer. Munro goes on to argue that the best way of slaying the deer would be when they <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> uphill (when gravity is against them), their principle home being in the heights. Contemporary with Munro, substantial stone walls were built in the glens to funnel deer into pens.|$|E
5|$|People {{from the}} {{overpopulated}} western highlands and the underdeveloped north <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> to the coastal plantation zone and urban centres for employment.

5|$|The {{autonomous}} navigation of the Air-Cobot robot is in two phases. The first, navigation in {{the airport}} or the factory, allows the robot to move close to the aircraft. The second navigation, around the aircraft, allows the robot to position itself at control points referenced in the aircraft virtual model. In addition, the robot must insert itself in a dynamic environment where humans and vehicles <b>are</b> <b>moving.</b> To address this problem, it has an obstacle avoidance module. Many navigation algorithms are constantly running on the robot with real time constraints. Searches are conducted on optimizing the computing time.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory of}} plate {{tectonics}} {{demonstrates that the}} continents of the Earth <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> across the surface {{at the rate of}} a few centimeters per year. This is expected to continue, causing the plates to relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within the planet and the presence of a hydrosphere. With the loss of either of these, continental drift will come to a halt. The production of heat through radiogenic processes is sufficient to maintain mantle convection and plate subduction {{for at least the next}} 1.1 billion years.|$|E
5|$|This metric {{contains}} a scale factor, which {{describes how the}} size of the universe changes with time. This enables a convenient choice of a coordinate system to be made, called comoving coordinates. In this coordinate system, the grid expands along with the universe, and objects that <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> only because of the expansion of the universe, remain at fixed points on the grid. While their coordinate distance (comoving distance) remains constant, the physical distance between two such co-moving points expands proportionally with the scale factor of the universe.|$|E

5|$|When stars <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> at {{sufficiently}} high peculiar velocities, their astrospheres {{can generate}} bow shocks as they collide with the interstellar medium. For decades {{it was assumed}} that the Sun had a bow shock. In 2012, data from Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) and NASA's Voyager probes showed that the Sun's bow shock does not exist. Instead, these authors argue that a subsonic bow wave defines the transition from the solar wind flow to the interstellar medium. A bow shock is the third boundary of an astrosphere after the termination shock and the astropause (called the heliopause in the Solar System).|$|E

The number of organized shortwave listening clubs has diminished along with printed magazines devoted to the hobby; however, many enthusiasts continue to exchange information and news on the web.|$|E
5|$|A {{more complex}} example of stepped {{impedance}} design {{is presented in}} figure 6. Again, narrow lines are used to implement inductors and wide lines correspond to capacitors, but in this case, the lumped-element counterpart has resonators connected in shunt across the main line. This topology {{can be used to}} design elliptical filters or Chebyshev filters with poles of attenuation in the stopband. However, calculating component values for these structures is an involved process and has led to designers often choosing to implement them as m-derived filters instead, which perform well and are much easier to calculate. The purpose of incorporating resonators is to improve the stopband rejection. However, beyond the resonant frequency of the highest frequency resonator, the stopband rejection starts to deteriorate as the resonators <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> towards open-circuit. For this reason, filters built to this design often have an additional single stepped-impedance capacitor as the final element of the filter. This also ensures good rejection at high frequency.|$|E
50|$|From Bernoulli's principle, the {{pressure}} on the upper surface where the flow <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> faster <b>is</b> lower than {{the pressure}} on the lower surface where it <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> slower. This pressure difference creates a net aerodynamic force, pointing upward.|$|R
