A comparison of two 65 -year data sets (1876 – 1940 and 1941 – 2005) of <b>average</b> <b>daily</b> <b>flows</b> did not show any significant change in the basic statistical characteristics of the Danube river discharge. The analysis of the long-term average monthly Danube discharges revealed, that in the last 25 years the discharge rates increased in the winter half-year, while a decline was observed between June and August. From the long-term trend analysis it follows, that the mean annual Danube discharge at Bratislava, in any case did not rise in the 1876 – 2005 period. The third part of this study is devoted to the long-term prediction of monthly discharge of the Danube by applying stochastic methods. The following two types of models were used for the prediction: 1. hidden Markov model derived from Fourier series; 2. stochastic seasonal auto-regression model of moving averages- SARIMA.

The area experiences intensive {{water resources management}} and ecosystem monitoring due to its strategic role as the principal water supply for New York City. Study focusWe analyzed <b>average</b> <b>daily</b> <b>flows</b> in nested and non-nested pairs of gaged watersheds in the Catskills to assess whether <b>daily</b> <b>flow</b> in ungaged watersheds can be calculated based on watershed area ratios. New hydrological insights for the regionWatershed area ratio {{was the most important}} basin parameter for estimating flow at upstream sites based on downstream flow. The area ratio alone explained 93 % {{of the variance in the}} slopes of relationships between upstream and downstream flows. Regression analysis indicated that flow at any upstream point can be estimated by multiplying the flow at a downstream reference gage by the watershed area ratio. This method accurately predicted upstream flows at area ratios as low as 0. 005. We also observed a very strong relationship (R 2 = 0. 79) between area ratio and flow–flow slopes in non-nested catchments. Our results indicate that a simple flow estimation method based on watershed area ratios is justifiable, and indeed preferred, for the estimation of daily streamflow in ungaged watersheds in the Catskills region...|$|R
