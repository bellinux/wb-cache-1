50|$|Spinal {{muscular atrophy}} (SMA) and <b>ageing-related</b> motor {{degeneration}} share clear parallels with ALS in the patterns and specificity of motor neuron loss. Though {{it is completely}} distinct from ALS in its pathogenesis, SMA leads to a similar rapid death of FF motor neurons, with S type neurons being generally spared. Further, motor pools controlling facial muscles (including those of the eye) and voluntary excretory muscles are spared. Motor neuron degeneration caused by ageing similarly affects FF types but not S types; ageing also seems to spare ocular motor pools. These similar patterns of neurodegeneration in three different diseases have led researchers to speculate that slow-twitch motor neurons, along with motor pools of the eyes and excretory muscles, have intrinsic neuroprotective properties that are not disease-specific.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} the mechanisms underlying (1) the <b>ageing-related</b> motor handicap at the whole muscle, cellular, contractile protein and myonuclear levels; and (2) <b>ageing-related</b> differences in muscle adaptability. In vivo muscles function was studied in the knee extensors. Decreases were observed in isokinetic and isometric torque outputs in old age in the sedentary men and women and elite master sprinters. A 20 -week long specific sprint and resistance training successfully improved the maximal isometric force and rate of force development in a subgroup of master sprinters. In vitro measurements were performed in muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle. Immunocytochemical and contractile measurements in single membrane permeabilized muscle fibres demonstrated ageing- and gender-related changes at the myofibrillar level. In sedentary subjects, data showed a preferential decrease in the size of muscle fibres expressing type IIa MyHC in men, lower force generating capacity in muscle fibres expressing the type I MyHC isoform in both men and women and lower maximum velocity of unloaded shortening (V 0) in fibres expressing types I and IIa MyHC isoforms in both men and women. The master sprinters also experienced the typical <b>ageing-related</b> reduction in the size of fast-twitch fibres, a shift toward a slower MyHC isoform profile and a lower V 0 of type I MyHC fibres, which {{played a role in the}} decline in explosive force production capacity. The fast-twitch fibre area increased after the resistance training period. A model combining single muscle fibre confocal microscopy with a novel algorithm for 3 D imaging of myonuclei in single muscle fibre segments was introduced to study the spatial organisation of myonuclei and the size of individual myonuclear domains (MNDs). Significant changes in the MND size variability and myonuclear organization were observed in old age, irrespective gender and fibre type. Those changes may influence the local quantity of specific proteins per muscle fibre volume by decreased and/or local cooperativity of myonuclei in a gender and muscle fibre specific manner. In conclusion, the <b>ageing-related</b> impairments in in vivo muscle function were related to significant changes in morphology, contractile protein expression and regulation at the muscle fibre level. It is suggested that the altered myonuclear organisation observed in old age impacts on muscle fibre protein synthesis and degradation with consequences for the <b>ageing-related</b> changes in skeletal muscle structure and function. However, the improved muscle function in response to a 20 -week intense physical training regime in highly motivated physically active old subjects demonstrates that all <b>ageing-related</b> in muscle function are not immutable...|$|E

We tested this using muscle-derived stem/progenitor cells (MDSPCs) in a murine progeria model.

Intraperitoneal administration of MDSPCs, isolated from young wild-type mice, to progeroid mice confer significant lifespan and healthspan extension. The transplanted MDSPCs improve degenerative changes and vascularization in tissues where donor cells are not detected, suggesting that their therapeutic effect may be mediated by secreted factor(s). Indeed, young wild-type-MDSPCs rescue proliferation and differentiation defects of aged MDSPCs when co-cultured.

40|$|Motivation: The {{incidence}} of <b>ageing-related</b> diseases has been constantly increasing {{in the last}} decades, raising the need for creating effective methods to analyze <b>ageing-related</b> protein data. These methods should have high predictive accuracy and be easily interpretable by ageing experts. To enable this, one needs interpretable classification models (supervised machine learning) and features with rich biological meaning. In this paper we propose two interpretable feature types based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways and compare them with traditional feature types in hierarchical classification (a more challenging classification task regarding predictive performance) and binary classification (a classification task producing easier to interpret classification models). As far as we know, this work is the first to: (i) explore {{the potential of the}} KEGG pathway data in the hierarchical classification setting, (i) use the graph structure of KEGG pathways to create a feature type that quantifies the influence of a current protein on another specific protein within a KEGG pathway graph and (iii) propose a method for interpreting the classification models induced using KEGG features. Results: We performed tests measuring predictive accuracy considering hierarchical and binary class labels extracted from the Mouse Phenotype Ontology. One of the KEGG feature types leads to the highest predictive accuracy among five individual feature types across three hierarchical classification algorithms. Additionally, the combination of the two KEGG feature types proposed in this work results in one of the best predictive accuracies when using the binary class version of our datasets, at the same time enabling the extraction of knowledge from <b>ageing-related</b> data using quantitative influence information...|$|E
40|$|There {{is a clear}} {{motivation}} for ageing research, since ageing is the greatest risk factor for many diseases, including most types of cancer. Arguably, another strong {{motivation for}} ageing research is that, despite the large progress in this area {{in the last two}} decades, ageing is still to a large extent a poorly understood process, especially in humans. The vast majority of biogerontology research is still based on “wet lab” experiments done with simpler organisms, due to the problems associated with performing <b>ageing-related</b> experiments with humans. In contrast, this thesis proposes a data mining approach, based on classification algorithms, for analysing data about human DNA repair genes and their relationship to ageing. The classification algorithms – more precisely, decision tree induction and Naive Bayes algorithms – were applied to datasets prepared specifically for this research, by adapting and integrating data from several bioinformatics resources, namely: (a) the GenAge database of <b>ageing-related</b> genes; (b) a web site with a comprehensive list of human DNA repair genes; (c) Uniprot, a centralized repository of richly-annotated data about proteins; (d) the HPRD (Human Protein Reference Database); and (e) the Gene Ontology – a controlled vocabulary for describing gene or protein functions. Some experiments also used a separate dataset including gene expression data. Applying classification algorithms to such datasets aimed at producing classification models that identify which gene properties are most effective in discriminating <b>ageing-related</b> DNA repair genes from other types of genes – mainly non-ageing-related DNA repair genes, but in some experiments the other types of genes also included genes whose protein product interact with DNA repair genes. A related goal of this research was to analyse the automatically-built classification models from two perspectives, namely: (a) measuring the predictive accuracy (or “generalization ability”) of those models from a data mining perspective; and (b) interpreting the meaning of the main gene properties relevant for classification in those models, in the light of biological knowledge about DNA repair genes and the process of ageing. In summary, the main gene properties that were found effective in discriminating <b>ageing-related</b> DNA repair genes from other types of genes (mainly non-ageing-related DNA repair genes) in the datasets created in this research are as follows: <b>ageing-related</b> DNA repair genes’ protein products tend to interact with a considerably larger number of proteins; their protein products {{are much more likely to}} interact with WRN (a protein whose defect causes the Werner’s progeroid syndrome) and XRCC 5 (KU 80, a key protein in the initiation of DNA double-strand repair by the error-prone non-homologous end joining DNA repair pathway); they are more likely to be involved in response to chemical stimulus and, to a lesser extent, in response to endogenous stimulus or oxidative stress; and they are more likely to have high expression in T lymphocytes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The ageing of the {{worldwide}} population means {{there is a growing}} need for research on the biology of ageing. DNA damage is likely a key contributor to the ageing process and elucidating the role of different DNA repair systems in ageing is of great interest. In this paper we propose a data mining approach, based on classification methods (decision trees and Naive Bayes), for analysing data about human DNA repair genes. The goal is to build classification models that allow us to discriminate between <b>ageing-related</b> and non-ageing-related DNA repair genes, in order to better understand their different properties. Results The main patterns discovered by the classification methods are as follows: (a) the number of protein-protein interactions was a predictor of DNA repair proteins being ageing-related; (b) the use of predictor attributes based on protein-protein interactions considerably increased predictive accuracy of attributes based on Gene Ontology (GO) annotations; (c) GO terms related to "response to stimulus" seem reasonably good predictors of ageing-relatedness for DNA repair genes; (d) interaction with the XRCC 5 (Ku 80) protein is a strong predictor of ageing-relatedness for DNA repair genes; and (e) DNA repair genes with a high expression in T lymphocytes {{are more likely to be}} <b>ageing-related.</b> Conclusions The above patterns are broadly integrated in an analysis discussing relations between Ku, the non-homologous end joining DNA repair pathway, ageing and lymphocyte development. These patterns and their analysis support non-homologous end joining double strand break repair as central to the ageing-relatedness of DNA repair genes.

40|$|It {{has been}} firmly {{established}} that ageing constitutes a principal {{risk factor for}} cardiac disease. Currently, the underlying mechanisms of ageing {{that contribute to the}} initiation or acceleration of cardiac disease are essentially unresolved. Prevailing theories of ageing center on the loss of cellular protein homeostasis, by either design (genetically) or "wear and tear" (environmentally). Either or both ways, the normal protein homeostasis in the cell is affected, resulting in aberrant and misfolded proteins. Should such misfolded proteins escape the protein quality control (PQC) system, they become proteotoxic and accelerate the loss of cellular integrity.

To measure cognitive performance and brain pathology, we conducted detailed neuropsychological assessments and multi-modality neuroimaging (T 1 -weighted, T 2 -weighted, diffusion-MRI, resting-state functional-MRI, spectroscopy, arterial spin labelling) at baseline and after two-year follow-up. Group differences in rates of change were assessed using linear mixed effects models. Results 123 PLWH and 78 HIV-negative controls completed longitudinal assessments (median interval = 1. 97 years). There were no differences between PLWH and HIV-negative controls in age, sex, years of education, smoking, alcohol use, recreational drug use, blood pressure, body-mass index or cholesterol levels.
