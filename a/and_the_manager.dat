5|$|As the British {{government}} has no legal jurisdiction, it requires the local residents to form a representative committee according {{to the laws of}} the long-defunct dukedom before negotiating with them. Ancient Burgundian law requires that the Duke himself appoint a council. Sébastien de Charolais arrives and presents his claim to the title, which is verified by Professor Hatton-Jones. He forms the governing body which includes the local policeman, Spiller, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>manager</b> of the bank branch, Mr. Wix; the neighbourhood shop keeper, Arthur Pemberton, is appointed as Burgundy's Prime Minister. The council begin discussions with the government, particularly about the Burgundian treasure.|$|E
5|$|For La belle Hélène, Offenbach secured Hortense Schneider to {{play the}} title role. Since her early success in his short operas, {{she had become a}} leading star of the French musical stage. She now {{commanded}} large fees and was notoriously temperamental, but Offenbach was adamant that no other singer could match her as Hélène. Rehearsals for the premiere at the Théâtre des Variétés were tempestuous, with Schneider and the principal mezzo-soprano feuding, the censor fretting about the satire of the imperial court, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>manager</b> of the theatre attempting to rein in Offenbach's extravagance with production expenses. Once again the success of the piece was inadvertently assured by the critic Janin; his scandalised notice was strongly countered by liberal critics and the ensuing publicity again brought the public flocking.|$|E

5|$|After {{spending}} years modeling, including winning Miss Hawaiian Tropic Canada in 2003, Ouellet {{was hired}} by the professional wrestling promotion WWE in August 2006, after she participated in the WWE Diva Search competition. She spent time in Ohio Valley Wrestling and Florida Championship Wrestling, WWE's developmental territories, before being assigned to the SmackDown brand in 2008. In December 2008, Maryse won her first WWE Divas Championship and held it for seven months, which is the third longest reign in the championship's history. In April 2009, she was drafted to the Raw brand, and won the WWE Divas Championship {{for the second time in}} February 2010, making her the first wrestler to have held the championship on more than one occasion.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that the personality traits influence {{the occurrence of}} conflicts <b>and</b> that <b>the</b> <b>managers</b> have important responsibilities {{to deal with these}} conflicts.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the Second World War, Waddington was {{appointed}} chairman of the North Eastern Division Advisory Committee for the Control of Oils and Fats and became an agent of the Ministry of Food. His responsibilities included arranging for the storage of fats. When the war concluded, he was charged with conspiracy to defraud the Ministry of Food when it was discovered that a letter detailing amounts of money had been altered. The prosecution alleged that between 1943 and 1944, Waddington <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>manager</b> of another fat storage firm shared £1,600 between them which should have gone to the latter's company when the price paid by the Ministry for storage increased. Waddington denied all knowledge; his brother Priestley, another director at the family firm, said that he made the arrangements to pay a portion of the increased fees to Waddington's co-defendant without the knowledge of Waddington. Waddington was acquitted when a judge ruled {{that there was no way}} that it could be proven that he had known of the alteration to the letter, or that he was in any way responsible.|$|E
5|$|For Kinkladze, {{the start}} of the 2001–02 season {{followed}} a similar pattern to the previous season, comprising a mixture of starts and substitute appearances. Jim Smith resigned from his managerial position at Derby on 7 October 2001, leaving Kinkladze, a Smith favourite, bitterly disappointed. The appointment of new manager Colin Todd signalled a change in the club's playing style. Todd did not favour flair players, and Kinkladze made only a single substitute appearance in Todd's first two months in charge. Frustrated by a lack of opportunities, Kinkladze took the unusual step of using his lawyer to arrange a meeting with Todd to discuss his exclusion from the first team. Todd reacted by telling Kinkladze he could leave the club if he was unhappy. According to Kinkladze's agent, Manchester City, as well as Spanish clubs Valencia, Mallorca and Málaga, were all interested in signing Kinkladze. However, Todd was sacked on 14 January 2002 with Derby second from bottom of the Premier League, and John Gregory was appointed as manager on 30 January 2002. Kinkladze stayed at the club, playing regular first team football in the remainder of the season, but Derby continued to struggle, and Kinkladze endured relegation {{for the third time in}} his career. The club, who were £35 million in debt, started an end-of-season clear-out to reduce their annual £17 million wage bill. Derby's actions included off-loading of some of the highest earners, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>manager</b> informed Kinkladze that he had no future at the club. However, Kinkladze, whose contract ended in summer 2003, was reluctant to leave the club and turned down a move to Turkish champions Galatasaray.|$|E
