25|$|In May 2009, the Justice Minister, Jack Straw, {{said that}} while he could not change the law, he could amend the {{sentencing}} guidelines to require judges to treat {{an attack on a}} member of a subculture as an <b>aggravating</b> <b>factor</b> similar to a racially motivated or homophobic assault when sentencing perpetrators.|$|E
25|$|Before Teresa's death, Syriani {{was charged}} with {{assault with a deadly}} weapon with intent to kill. This charge was changed to capital murder after her death. On June 12, 1991 he was sentenced to death in Mecklenburg County Superior Court, with the jury finding as an <b>aggravating</b> <b>factor</b> the crime being {{especially}} heinous, atrocious, or cruel. This outweighed the eight mitigating circumstances they also found.|$|E
25|$|The Court found that, {{because of}} the jury's finding at least one <b>aggravating</b> <b>factor</b> was a {{prerequisite}} for imposing the death penalty, Georgia's scheme adequately narrowed the class of defendants eligible for the death penalty. Although there was admittedly some discretion as to the mitigation phase, that discretion is channeled in an objective way, and therefore provided for individualized sentencing. Thus, Georgia's death penalty scheme complied with the Furman requirements and was thus approved by the Court.|$|E
50|$|Third, the Clause {{prevents}} the arbitrary and discriminatory {{use of the}} death penalty. Nor can the death penalty be mandatory for those convicted of a certain offense. <b>Aggravating</b> <b>factors</b> must be found by a jury. <b>Aggravating</b> <b>factors</b> cannot be vague. The sentencing decision-maker must {{have the authority to}} consider all mitigating factors.|$|R

25|$|First, at the {{sentencing}} hearing of a capital felon, the jury determined whether {{one or more}} <b>aggravating</b> <b>factors</b> exist, drawing on a list very similar to Georgia's. Then the jury was specifically asked to weigh the mitigating evidence presented against the statutory <b>aggravating</b> <b>factors</b> that have been proved. This scheme is called a weighing scheme.|$|R
25|$|Other {{initiatives}} {{have included the}} establishment of the Commission for Equality and Human Rights on 1 October 2007 which is tasked with working for equality in all areas and replaced the previous commissions dedicated to sex, race and disability alone; the setting up of the Sexual Orientation and Gender Advisory Group within the Department of Health; a provision of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 that a court must treat hostility based on sexual orientation as an <b>aggravating</b> <b>factor</b> for sentencing a person; guidance from the Crown Prosecution Service on dealing with homophobic crime; and a commitment from the Government to work for LGBT rights at an international level.|$|E
25|$|Societies {{have varied}} in their attitudes and {{cultural}} standards regarding public intoxication, historically {{based on the}} relationship between religion and drugs in general, and religion and alcohol in particular. In some instances, consumption of a mind-altering substance has formed the basis of religious or other socially approved ceremonies and festivals. In others, intoxication has been stigmatized as a sign of human weakness, of immorality, or as a sin. Secular approaches may also vary, having less inherent opposition to drugs but acknowledging that these may affect the inhibitions that help to keep socialized individuals from breaking prevailing social taboos {{which may or may not}} have been expressly criminalized. The attitude of a legal system to intoxicating substances can affect the applicability of intoxication as a defense under its laws: a system strongly opposed to a substance may even view intoxication as an <b>aggravating</b> <b>factor</b> rather than a mitigating one.|$|E
25|$|From time to time, new {{vulnerabilities}} {{are discovered}} in various versions of Adobe Reader, prompting {{the company to}} issue security fixes. Other PDF readers are also susceptible. One <b>aggravating</b> <b>factor</b> is that a PDF reader can be configured to start automatically if a web page has an embedded PDF file, providing a vector for attack. If a malicious web page contains an infected PDF file that takes advantage of a vulnerability in the PDF reader, the system may be compromised even if the browser is secure. Some of these vulnerabilities {{are a result of}} the PDF standard allowing PDF documents to be scripted with JavaScript. Disabling JavaScript execution in the PDF reader can help mitigate such future exploits, although it does not protect against exploits {{in other parts of the}} PDF viewing software. Security experts say that JavaScript is not essential for a PDF reader, and that the security benefit that comes from disabling JavaScript outweighs any compatibility issues caused. One way of avoiding PDF file exploits is to have a local or web service convert files to another format before viewing.|$|E

2500|$|Under California's DSL, {{the middle}} term is the [...] "statutory maximum" [...] {{sentence}} for Blakely purposes. [...] The DSL required judges {{to impose the}} middle term unless <b>aggravating</b> <b>factors</b> were found to exist, and those <b>aggravating</b> <b>factors</b> by definition did not include any element of the crime. [...] Thus, the maximum sentence the judge could impose {{based solely on the}} jury's findings was the middle term, not the high term.|$|R
500|$|Intent is a {{function}} of kaṣāya, which refers to negative emotions and negative qualities of mental (or deliberative) action. The presence of intent acts as an <b>aggravating</b> <b>factor,</b> increasing the vibrations of the soul, which results in the soul absorbing more karma. This is explained by Tattvārthasūtra 6.7: [...] " [...] intentional act produces a strong karmic bondage and [...] unintentional produces weak, shortlived karmic bondage." [...] Similarly, the physical act is also not a necessary condition for karma to bind to the soul: the existence of intent alone is sufficient. This is explained by Kundakunda (1st Century CE) in Samayasāra 262–263: [...] "The intent to kill, to steal, to be unchaste and to acquire property, whether these offences are actually carried or not, leads to bondage of evil karmas." [...] Jainism thus places an equal emphasis on the physical act as well as intent for binding of karmas.|$|E
500|$|The way the {{situation}} had been handled was subject to criticism; firstly, the choice by Carmichael-Smyth to hold the firing drill parade was immediately criticised by his superior, Hewitt, who felt that had the parade not been held, the issue with the cartridges [...] "would have blown over." [...] Furthermore, a junior officer from Carmichael-Smyth's regiment, Lieutenant John Campbell MacNabb, felt that the drill parade was unnecessary and stated that the dislike held by the men toward their commanding officer was an <b>aggravating</b> <b>factor</b> in the events that followed. When Hewitt informed the Commander in Chief, Major General George Anson, about the public nature of the men's sentence, and of placing them in irons {{in front of the}} entire Meerut Division, on 9 May, Anson confirmed the sentences but did not approve of the [...] "unusual procedure" [...] that Hewitt had followed. For his conduct on 10 May, Hewitt later faced criticism from Lieutenant General Sir Patrick Grant, (who was the acting Commander in Chief by that point, following Anson's death) and from John Lawrence (who was then Commissioner of Punjab province). Following the mutiny of the troops at Meerut, Hewitt's command of the Meerut Division was taken away. At a subsequent appeal, Hewitt and his immediate subordinate, Brigadier General Archdale Wilson of the Bengal Artillery, blamed each other for the way {{the situation}} unfolded; Hewitt said that Wilson was responsible for the tactics on the day, and Wilson stated that as Hewitt was the overall commander, responsibility lay with him; Hewitt lost the appeal. The historian Kim A. Wagner, in his 2010 book The Great Fear of 1857, stated that the senior officers' fear of [...] "making a 'wrong decision'" [...] led them to make no decision at all, [...] "with devastating results".|$|E
2500|$|Liquid stool is more {{difficult}} to control than formed, solid stool. Hence, FI can be exacerbated by diarrhea.

This may give side effects of FI, diarrhea and steatorrhea.|$|E

2500|$|In two earlier decisions, the Court {{had ruled}} that {{aggravating}} factors imposing {{the death penalty}} where the murder was [...] "outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman," [...] or where the murder was [...] "especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel," [...] was unconstitutionally vague. [...] In Walton, however, the Court reversed this trend and upheld Arizona's [...] "especially heinous, cruel, or depraved" [...] <b>aggravating</b> <b>factor</b> against a similar challenge.|$|E
2500|$|Walton v. Arizona, 497 U.S. 639 (1990), was a United States Supreme Court {{case that}} upheld two {{important}} aspects of [...] the capital sentencing scheme in Arizona — judicial sentencing and the <b>aggravating</b> <b>factor</b> [...] "especially heinous, cruel, or depraved" [...] — as not unconstitutionally vague. The Court overruled {{the first of these}} holdings in Ring v. Arizona, [...] The second of these holdings has yet to be overturned.|$|E
2500|$|The {{effects of}} the Great Depression reached Hungary after 1930 and it hit {{predominantly}} agriculture. The pengő had to be devalued and the debt of the country increased. After {{a short period of}} recovery, the war preparations [...] amongst which the most important was the Győr-program [...] had loosened the financial and monetary discipline which in turn led to the depreciation of the pengő currency. The territories given back to Hungary by the First and Second Vienna Awards in 1938 and 1940 were economically less developed, which was an additional <b>aggravating</b> <b>factor</b> regarding the economic situation of the country.|$|E

25|$|The {{fact that}} the jury had found that two <b>aggravating</b> <b>factors</b> applied to Coker's crime (his prior {{convictions}} and the {{fact that the}} rape was committed during the course of a robbery) did not change the Court's conclusion. The rape may have been committed during the course of another crime and by a hardened criminal, but the rape did not escalate into a killing. Finally, even a deliberate killing does not merit a death sentence under Georgia law without the finding of <b>aggravating</b> <b>factors.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Some authors like Franz Schelling {{proposed}} a mechanical damage procedure based on violent blood reflux. Later the focus moved to softer hemodynamic abnormalities, which were showing precede changes in sub-cortical gray matter and in substantia nigra. However, such {{reports of a}} [...] "hemodynamic cause of MS" [...] are not universal, and possibly not even common. At this time the evidence is largely anecdotal and some MS patients have no blood flow issues. Possibly vascular problems may be an <b>aggravating</b> <b>factor,</b> like many others in MS. Indeed, the research, by demonstrating patients with no hemodynamic problems actually prove {{that this is not}} the only cause of MS.|$|E
2500|$|But the Arizona {{system was}} {{different}} in both these areas. First, a jury {{was not involved}} in the sentencing phase of a capital case at all — a judge sitting alone presided over the sentencing hearing and made both the preliminary findings of fact and the ultimate decision. [...] Because judges were presumed to follow the law, they needed no guidance in finding a killing to be [...] "heinous, cruel, or depraved" [...] in the correct circumstances. Second, the Arizona Supreme Court had developed a body of law that defined the words [...] "heinous, cruel, or depraved." [...] Thus, there were legal standards available for trial judges to follow in imposing the death sentence. [...] For the Walton Court, these key differences meant that Arizona's [...] "especially heinous, cruel, or depraved" [...] <b>aggravating</b> <b>factor</b> satisfied the dictates of the Eighth Amendment.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Blackmun {{disagreed}} with the Court's conclusion that the judge-only sentencing and appellate definition of [...] "heinous, cruel, or depraved" [...] allowed it to uphold Walton's death sentence. In the Court's view, the state supreme court's definition of the words [...] "heinous, cruel, or depraved" [...] provided [...] "meaningful guidance" [...] to trial judges charged with carrying out sentencing hearings and applying the standards the Arizona Supreme Court had propounded. Justice Blackmun pointed out that [...] "the State Supreme Court's opinions, however, will serve to narrow [...] discretion only if that body of case law articulates a construction of the aggravating circumstance that is coherent and consistent, and that meaningfully limits the range of homicides to which the <b>aggravating</b> <b>factor</b> will apply." [...] In Justice Blackmun's opinion, {{there was no such}} definition to be found in Arizona law.|$|E
40|$|Humanitarian {{agencies}} regularly {{carry out}} nutrition surveys {{to estimate the}} prevalence of acute malnutrition (wasting) and mortality {{as well as to}} collect data {{on a wide range of}} contributory or <b>aggravating</b> <b>factors</b> in order to identify interventions and to direct aid where it is most needed. In this study, the case of Ethiopia was used (i) to assess the proportion of 291 nutrition surveys conducted between 2003 and 2008 that used the recommended sampling method to estimate the prevalence of wasting, (ii) to assess how and what data on indicators of <b>aggravating</b> <b>factors</b> were collected, (iii) to examine whether data on such factors can be used to establish priorities for emergency assistance based on Ethiopian Government guidelines and (iv) to discuss the general value of such data. All but one survey used the recommended methods to estimate the prevalence of wasting. Data were collected on more than 40 indicators of <b>aggravating</b> <b>factors</b> related to health, caring practices, food security and coping strategies, but no consistent methods or indicators were used, resulting in inconsistent data. This illustrates the need to develop and agree upon a set of core indicators of <b>aggravating</b> <b>factors</b> and then thresholds to describe the humanitarian situation in Ethiopia and elsewhere and to indicate priorities for interventions...|$|R
