5|$|Entering {{the final}} game of the 1958 season, Cleveland needed to either win or tie against the New York Giants to clinch the Eastern Conference title and the right to host the {{championship}} game. Cleveland lost that game under snowy conditions on a 49-yard field goal by Pat Summerall as time expired, and then lost <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> <b>game</b> against the Giants the following week to end the season. The Giants went on to play the Baltimore Colts in the championship, a game often cited as the seed of professional football's popularity surge in the U.S.|$|E

On March 29, 1934 in <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> <b>game</b> against the Montreal Maroons Gardiner had a shutout as the Black Hawks won 3–0; though he was named first star as the best player of the game, Gardiner was in extreme pain during the entire game with a fever of 102 Fahrenheit and was attended to by a doctor in the dressing room during intermissions.|$|E

5|$|When Cleveland {{entered the}} NFL in 1950, {{questions}} lingered {{about whether the}} team could sustain its early dominance. The Browns, however, began the season by beating the defending NFL champions, the Philadelphia Eagles. The team finished with a 10–2 regular-season record and reached the championship game after winning <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> <b>game</b> against the New York Giants. In the championship against the Los Angeles Rams, Lavelli caught 11 passes – then a record for a title game – and had two touchdown receptions. The Browns won the game 30–28.|$|E

5|$|In the 2010–11 season, the {{aforementioned}} 2010 Seahawks won the NFC West with a 7–9 record, hosting and defeating the 11–5 New Orleans Saints. Failing {{to make the}} playoffs were the New York Giants and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, both with 10–6 records, due to losing tiebreakers for the sixth seed to the Green Bay Packers, who {{went on to become the}} first sixth-seeded team from the NFC to win the Super Bowl. The 2010 Seahawks were the first team in NFL history to win both a division championship and <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> <b>game</b> with a losing regular season record. They currently have the lowest win percentage of any team to ever make the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|In the 2014–15 season, the Carolina Panthers won the NFC South with a 7–8–1 record. By week 16, no team in that {{division}} {{could finish}} {{with more than}} seven wins. The Panthers then defeated the Atlanta Falcons, who were 6–9 and undefeated within the division entering the game, for the division title. They hosted and defeated the 11–5 Arizona Cardinals in the wild card round. The best team to miss the playoffs that year was the Philadelphia Eagles, who finished 10–6. To date, the 2014 Panthers and 2010 Seahawks {{are the only two}} teams to win a division, and <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> <b>game,</b> with a losing record.|$|E
5|$|Jordan's {{second season}} {{was cut short}} when he broke his foot in the third game of the year, causing him to miss 64 games. Despite Jordan's injury and a 30–52 record (at {{the time it was}} fifth worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history), the Bulls made the playoffs. Jordan {{recovered}} in time to participate in the playoffs and performed well upon his return. Against a 1985–86 Boston Celtics team that is often considered one of the greatest in NBA history, Jordan set the still-unbroken record for points in <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> <b>game</b> with 63 in Game 2.

5|$|On January 13, 2010, Bryan Murray {{relieved}} Goaltending Coach Eli Wilson of his duties. Immediately afterward, {{the team}} {{went on a}} team-record 11-game winning streak. The streak propelled the team {{to the top of}} the Northeast Division standings and a top-three placing for the playoffs. The team was unable to hold off the Sabres for the division lead, but qualified for the playoffs in the fifth position. For the third season in four, the Senators played off against the Penguins in the first round. A highlight for the Senators was winning a triple-overtime fifth game in Pittsburgh, but the team was unable to win <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> <b>game</b> on home ice, losing the series in six games.|$|E
5|$|On October 24, 2007, Olli Jokinen {{scored two}} goals against the Philadelphia Flyers {{to become the}} franchise's all-time leader in both goals and points. Both marks were {{previously}} held by Scott Mellanby. Jokinen also became the all-time leader in assists, surpassing Robert Svehla. However, with the Panthers' struggles to make the playoffs, Jokinen never played <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> <b>game</b> for the franchise. No one player holds as many playoff records for the Panthers as Jokinen does for the regular-season versions. Robert Svehla holds the career record for assists, Ed Jovanovski is the leader in games played, Paul Laus owns the record for most penalty minutes and Dave Lowry shares the goal scoring lead with Ray Sheppard, who also holds the franchise record for playoff points.|$|E
5|$|Each Asia League Ice Hockey {{regulation}} game is an {{ice hockey}} game played between two teams and is 60 minutes long. The game comprises three 20-minute periods separated by two 15 minute intermissions. While some teams have television broadcast contracts, {{they do not}} take television time-outs like the NHL. At {{the end of the}} 60 minute game, the team with the most goals wins. If the game is tied at the end of 60 minutes, the teams play an overtime period. Overtime is five minutes, with four skaters on each team. If the game remains tied after five minutes, then the teams partake in a three player shoot-out, until one team comes out ahead. Prior to the 2008–09 season these games ended in a tie with no shoot-out. In <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> <b>game</b> the league doesn't use the shoot-out and instead the teams play continual overtime periods of 20 minutes until one team scores.|$|E

5|$|Hershey won {{the first}} game 5–2 on April 26, with Crabb opening scoring with a power play goal, and the Bears taking a 4–0 lead by the second period, {{resulting}} in Providence goaltender Niklas Svedberg being pulled from the game. The victory marked Hershey's first game one win in a playoff series since defeating Manchester in the 2009–10 Eastern Conference finals. The Bears also won their second game 5–4 on April 28, with Grubauer making 54 saves, eight short of matching the team's playoff record. The Bruins allowed 64 shots, which were six short of Hershey's highest in <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> <b>game.</b> Hershey was losing 4–3 in the third, their first time trailing in the series, but Grubauer was pulled for an extra attacker and Crabb tied the game with 91 seconds in regulation, allowing DiSalvatore to score the game-winner in overtime on a power play. Hershey's 5-for-10 power play record ranked {{the highest in the}} Calder Cup playoffs at the time.|$|E
5|$|Selänne then {{declined}} {{an option}} in his contract {{that would have}} paid $6.5 million in 2003–04 and instead opted to sign a one-year, $5.8 million contract with the Colorado Avalanche, where he was joined by former Anaheim teammate Paul Kariya. The pair chose to sign with the Avalanche together in the belief it was their best chance at winning the Stanley Cup. Their hope failed to materialize, however, as Selänne endured a disastrous season in which he scored only 16 goals and 32 points—the lowest totals of his career to that date—and was ultimately relegated to Colorado's fourth line, but was also held out of the lineup as a healthy scratch during <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> <b>game.</b> He struggled throughout the year with knee problems that ultimately required surgery, his third such procedure, and with the 2004–05 season canceled by a labour dispute, took the time off to recover.|$|E
5|$|The 1932 NFL season {{resulted}} in a tie for first place between the Chicago Bears and Portsmouth Spartans, {{and could not be}} resolved by the typical winloss system. To settle the tie, <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> <b>game</b> was played; Chicago won the game and the championship. The following year, the NFL split into two divisions, and the winner of each division would play in the NFL Championship Game. In 1967, the NFL and the rival AFL agreed to merge, effective following the 1969 season; as part of this deal, the NFL champion from 1966 to 1969 would play the AFL champion in an AFL–NFL World Championship Game {{in each of the four}} seasons before the completed merger. The NFL Championship Game was ended after the 1969 season, succeeded by the NFC Championship Game. The champions of that game play the champions of the AFC Championship Game in the Super Bowl to determine the NFL champion.|$|E
