25|$|For each episode's score, Goldsmith {{simulated}} a real orchestra with a synthesizer {{palette of}} an eighty-piece symphony orchestra for budgetary reasons, although he occasionally used {{two or three}} musicians for added orchestral authenticity. Goldsmith's long-time assistant Neal Acree started composing additional music for Stargate SG-1 in Season 8. The amount of composed music varied between 12 and 33 minutes out of a 44-minute episode, {{with an average of}} around 22 to 26 minutes, making the full symphonic score of SG-1 more time-consuming to create than for general TV shows. Since Goldsmith lived <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> from Vancouver, he and the producers discussed ideas over the phone and exchanged tapes via Federal Express for several years until the show switched to Internet file transfers.|$|E
2500|$|Three days later, <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away,</b> {{the scene}} {{repeated}} itself: again the long lines, again the silent tribute, again the thousands filling {{the great hall}} of the Rivergate Convention Center in downtown New Orleans this time. Mayor Moon Landrieu and Louisiana Governor John J. McKeithen joined gospel singer Bessie Griffin. Dick Gregory praised Jackson's [...] "moral force" [...] as {{the main reason for}} her success. Lou Rawls sang [...] "Just a Closer Walk With Thee". The funeral cortège of 24 limousines drove slowly past her childhood place of worship, Mt. Moriah Baptist Church, where her recordings played through loudspeakers. The procession made its way to Providence Memorial Park in Metairie, Louisiana, where she was entombed. Despite the inscription of her birth year on her gravestone as 1912, she was actually born in 1911. Among her surviving relatives are her great-nephews, NBA basketball player Danny Granger and soul artist Scotty Granger.|$|E

60|$|There were {{thoughtful}} and sagacious men, {{who began to}} doubt whether a great country like America would always be content to remain under the government of <b>an</b> island three <b>thousand</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away.</b> This was the more doubtful, because the English Parliament had long ago made laws which were intended to be very beneficial to England {{at the expense of}} America. By these laws the colonists were forbidden to manufacture articles for their own use, or to carry on trade with any nation but the English.|$|R
50|$|Usmani’s {{selection}} as candidate arose from his {{prominence in the}} Meerut trial. Since he was <b>a</b> prisoner <b>thousands</b> of <b>miles</b> <b>away,</b> {{he was unable to}} conduct the campaign himself, so a deputy to represent him was chosen - one Billy Brain. Communists from many parts of Britain converged at Spen Valley. The campaign was successful {{in the sense that it}} brought into focus Meerut and harshness of British rule in India, which were hitherto unknown to many.|$|R

60|$|It was {{the same}} with other known objects. Up to five, whether shoes or shirts or pillow-slips, Michael would fetch the number requested. And between the {{mathematical}} mind of Michael, who counted to five, and {{the mind of the}} ancient black at Tulagi, who counted sticks of tobacco in units of five, was a distance shorter than that between Michael and Dag Daughtry who could do multiplication and long division. In the same manner, up the same ladder of mathematical ability, a still greater distance separated Dag Daughtry from Captain Duncan, who by mathematics navigated the Makambo. Greatest mathematical distance of all was that between Captain Duncan's mind and the mind of an astronomer who charted the heavens and navigated <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> million <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> among the stars and who tossed, a mere morsel of his mathematical knowledge, the few shreds of information to Captain Duncan that enabled him to know from day to day the place of the Makambo on the sea.|$|R
50|$|Reflecting {{on the use}} {{to which}} her {{ethnography}} had been put, she expressed a lively wariness about how aboriginal material can be reworked to fit some modern theory,under the misapprehension that the scholar thereby evinces a 'detachment' from the immediate world of his study's distant subjects, as when she remarked perceptively, as Evans notes, observed that:I dare say little {{with an air of}} finality about black people; I have lived too much with them for that. To be positive, you should never spend more than six months in their neighbourhood; in fact, {{if you want to keep}} your anthropological ideas quite firm, it is safer to let the blacks remain in inland Australia while you stay <b>a</b> few <b>thousand</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away.</b> Otherwise, your preconceived notions are almost sure to totter to their foundations; and nothing is more annoying than to have elaborately built-up, delightfully logical theories, played ninepins with by an old greybeard of a black, who apparently objects to his beliefs being classified, docketed, and pigeon-holed, until he has had his say.|$|R

60|$|While {{the general}} was {{planning}} fortifications on Lake George, Colonel Bradstreet obtained permission to carry into effect an expedition {{which he had}} for some time meditated, and which had been a favored project with the lamented Howe. This was to reduce Fort Frontenac, the stronghold of the French {{on the north side}} of the entrance of Lake Ontario, commanding the mouth of the St. Lawrence. This post was a central point of Indian trade, where the tribes resorted from all parts of a vast interior; sometimes a distance of <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>miles,</b> to traffic <b>away</b> their peltries with the fur-traders. It was, moreover, a magazine for the more southern posts, among which was Fort Duquesne on the Ohio.|$|R
5000|$|Pizza {{is based}} on the {{traditional}} Italian dish, brought by Italian immigrants to the United States, but varies highly in style based on the region of development since its arrival. For example, [...] "Chicago" [...] style has focus on a thicker, taller crust, whereas a [...] "New York Slice" [...] is known to have a much thinner crust which can be folded. These different types of pizza can be advertised throughout the country and are generally recognizable and well-known, with some restaurants {{going so far as to}} import New York City tap water from <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> or more <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> to recreate the signature style in other regions.|$|R
50|$|After his embassy to Europe, Bar Sauma {{lived out}} the rest of his years in Baghdad. It was {{probably}} during this time that he wrote the account of his travels, which was published in English in 1928 as The Monks of Kublai Khan, Emperor of China or The History of the Life and Travels of Rabban Sawma, Envoy and Plenipotentiary of the Mongol Khans to the Kings of Europe, and Markos Who as Mar Yahbh-Allaha III Became Patriarch of the Church of the East in Asia, translated and edited by Sir E.

Their own name, the name of the people who dwelt thereon, {{translates}} delicately and justly into 'The Island of Tranquil Laughter.' On the chart you will find the erroneous name given to it by the old navigators to be Manatomana. The seafaring gentry the round ocean around called it the Adamless Eden. And the missionaries for a time called it God's Witness--so great had been their success at converting the inhabitants. As for me, it was, and ever shall be, Paradise.|$|R
5000|$|When someone {{discusses}} {{the amount of}} energy used to produce, harvest, transport and distribute a head of broccoli to <b>a</b> store three <b>thousand</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away,</b> the energy used can be expressed {{in terms of the number}} of energy slaves required to do that work. Since there are so many such deeply nested costs associated with the industrial infrastructure, we need some way to resolve the energy used to build the truck, to smelt the steel and convert petroleum into plastics, into units of human labor. Would we directly substitute an actual person walking across the country with the head of broccoli for the truck that actually carries it for the sake of comparative productivity? Or do we just divide the units of energy used by the industrial infrastructure by the number of calories used by one person to accomplish the same task, to get energy-slaves? ...|$|R
40|$|America, {{a country}} of {{multiple}} ethnics, is always open for endless list of topics of discussion for how each of its existing culture interplays with the others which results in multifaceted cultural dynamic. The social reality is one cause for American writers to elevate the uniqueness of a culture despite its capability to accommodate external influences. Amy Tan is one of prolific American writers, realizes the importance of acknowledging one’s former culture to establish a comprehensive understanding on one’s cultural identity regarding the complexity of American cultural web work. The Bonesetter’s Daughter {{is one of her}} paramount works in which she puts forth the idea of the rise of Chineseness in the main characters’ two-life spheres as Chinese-Americans. As the plot of the novel moving on, the readers will find that the journey of revisiting their Chineseness, the main characters do not only comprehend their identity as Chinese better, but is more capable of understanding their existence as Americans as well. The process of re-rooting of the main characters in The Bonesetter’s Daughter culturally is the bedrock for the analysis in this study. Their pride of being Chinese eventually brings them to a final conclusion of how their life is intermingled with a story of <b>a</b> country <b>thousands</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> from where they live which shapes their self-identity...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{assessing}} a battered woman’s risks is to centralize her {{safety in the}} most comprehensive way possible. At its best, effective evaluation of risks for battered women departs from traditional therapeutic models and illuminates the complex network of needs and problems each woman faces. It allows the practitioner and the battered women to address holistically the complicated realities of the woman’s experiences and existence. It recognizes that the apparent risks for a battered woman may be {{only the tip of}} an iceberg while significant portions of the dangers she faces remain hidden. Although the concept might seem simple, it is not an easy task. Such assessments begin with the individual woman and the immediate circumstances of her abuse, but may end with her extended family living in <b>a</b> village ten <b>thousand</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away.</b> Risk Assessment that Centralizes Battered Women’s Safety Effective risk assessment must take into account the diverse social factors of a battered woman’s life that impact her choices and decisions, especially regarding her experiences of battering. Quite often, these social factors facilitate her safety. However, just as frequently they act as hindrances to securing the same. It is these factors that are of vita...|$|R

40|$|Getting {{a college}} degree or finding {{continuing}} education courses in surveying/geomatics is still a problem {{in most parts of}} the world including the United States. There are only a handful of colleges or universities in the U. S. that offer baccalaureate or higher degrees in surveying even by traditional methods. An alternative to the traditional college education is distance learning. This method of education, although an old concept, has new meaning due to advanced delivery techniques. Continuing education has been the primary use of distance learning, but now, we have the means to deliver an entire college degree program to <b>a</b> student <b>thousands</b> of <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> from the campus. Distance learning in surveying/geomatics is still in its infancy and most are not familiar with some of the delivery techniques. For this reason, it is essential that students, employers, and regulatory agencies are convinced that the quality of the education provided via distance learning can be comparable to what is being delivered on campus in a traditional setting. It is important that the structuring of the program, support it receives from the university administration and delivery technologies are all geared towards maintaining the quality of education the students receive in distance learning programs...|$|R
