5|$|At Sinclair's home, Jenny {{discovers that}} he is a Nazi secret agent and knocks him out. She is later {{detained}} and forced to leave a message for Cliff to bring the rocket pack to the Griffith Observatory in exchange for her life. Just before he is arrested by the FBI and taken to Hughes and Peevy, Cliff hides the rocket pack. Hughes explains that his rocket pack is a prototype, similar to one that Nazi scientists have, up to now, been unsuccessful in developing, and shows them <b>a</b> <b>horrifying</b> propaganda film that reveals the scope of the Nazis' plans, depicting an army of flying soldiers invading the United States. The FBI agents mention that they are tracking a Nazi spy in Hollywood, whom Cliff realizes to be Sinclair. When Hughes demands the return of the rocket pack, Cliff explains that he needs it to rescue Jenny; he escapes, inadvertently leaving behind a clue to where he is headed.|$|E
5|$|The {{dampening}} {{of public}} enthusiasm for freak shows and human oddities continued {{and the police}} and magistrates became increasingly vigilant in closing shows down. Merrick remained <b>a</b> <b>horrifying</b> spectacle for his viewers and Roper grew nervous about the negative attention the Elephant Man drew from local authorities. Merrick's group of managers decided that he should go on tour in Continental Europe, {{with the hope that}} authorities there would be more lenient. Merrick's management was assumed by an unknown man (possibly named Ferrari) and they left for the Continent. The Elephant Man was no more successful there than in Britain, and similar action was taken by authorities to move him out of their jurisdictions. In Brussels, Merrick was deserted by this new manager, who stole Merrick's £50 (2015 equivalent £) savings. Abandoned, Merrick made his way by train to Ostend, where he attempted to board a ferry for Dover but was refused passage. He travelled to Antwerp and was able to board a ship bound for Harwich in Essex. From there, he travelled by train to London and arrived at Liverpool Street station.|$|E

25|$|A German {{exchange}} student {{said he was}} beaten randomly by riot police in the Exarheia district, his only reason for being there that he had accompanied other students to eat. The student gives <b>a</b> <b>horrifying</b> description of the violence he endured, he cowered in a corner when he saw police because {{a few weeks before}} he had witnessed police beating a man they had arrested. He claims that upon spotting him, about six police officers started beating him with their batons, and when they left they were replaced by another group of police. The student was unarmed and posed no threat but the police were ruthlessly brutal in their actions. It has been indicated that riot police left beaten and gravely individuals without any medical assistance. Amnesty International urges Greece to effectively and promptly investigate these crimes against civilians, which clearly violate human rights, and hold perpetrators accountable.|$|E

That's <b>a</b> <b>horrifying</b> image to throw at a little kid. You really could almost think that your talking in line, say, was on a par with killing Jesus." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Roadrunners" [...] first {{aired in}} the United States on Fox on November 26, 2000. The episode earned a Nielsen {{household}} rating of 8.3, {{meaning that it}} was seen by 8.3% of the nation's estimated households. The episode was viewed by 8.37 million households, and 13.6 million viewers. The episode ranked as the 38th most-watched episode for the week ending November 26. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the episode made its first appearance on television on March 1, 2001 on Sky1. [...] "Roadrunners" [...] was the seventh most watched program that week and received 0.67 million viewers. Fox promoted the episode with the tagline [...] "A desolate town.

500|$|Sissoi Veliky was {{repaired}} by Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée. The French engineers openly ridiculed {{the quality}} of Russian workmanship manifested in a [...] open seam between the belt armour and the ship's hull. This could have completely negated the battleship's protection if a shell had struck it. The Russian investigators reported <b>a</b> <b>horrifying</b> number of less obvious faults and deemed the ship unfit for sailing. The internal decks of the secondary armament casemates were particularly dangerous since the 152mm shells easily fell through the cracks and holes in the deck. The Saint Petersburg admirals dismissed these concerns, arguing that the gap between armour plates was an inevitable feature of the design, and that the decks and other faults could be fixed by the crew [...] "in their spare time".|$|E
500|$|Steinman rejoined Meat Loaf and {{the band}} for a live {{performance}} in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1978 {{with the intention of}} going through the songs for Bat II after the show. However, someone broke into their dressing rooms during the show and stole several possessions, including the new lyric book. Then, Meat Loaf lost his voice and was unable to record Renegade Angel. Steinman says [...] "he sounded literally like the little girl in The Exorcist... like a dragon trying to sing—it was <b>a</b> <b>horrifying</b> sound." [...] Steinman [...] "kept writing the music to Bat Out of Hell part 2... my sequel." [...] Not being able to [...] "bear for people not to hear those songs," [...] Steinman recorded the album, retitled Bad for Good, as a solo project, although Rory Dodd contributed lead vocals on some songs. Four songs from Bad for Good were included on Bat Out of Hell II. In 1989, Steinman formed all-female vocal group Pandora's Box. The album, Original Sin, was a commercial flop, but featured two songs which would also appear on Bat II. Meat Loaf says [...] "Jim put [...] "It Just Won't Quit" [...] on Original Sin without telling me. I could have strangled him." ...|$|E

500|$|Meyer {{moved to}} Boulder, Colorado because he [...] "just {{wanted to get}} {{as far from the}} New York {{environment}} as [...] could." [...] There, he wrote a film script for Letterman; the project was dropped due to the success of Letterman's show, although several of its jokes were later used in The Simpsons when no other ideas could be found. He spent time [...] "skiing, going to poetry readings, and trying to meet girls from the University of Colorado." [...] He founded the humor zine Army Man; he wrote the eight-page first issue almost wholly by himself, publishing just 200 copies which he gave to his friends. Meyer had been disappointed by the decline of the National Lampoon and felt that there was no longer a magazine which has the sole purpose of being funny. By starting Army Man he [...] "tried to make something that had no agenda other than to make you laugh." [...] He claimed that [...] " [...] didn't know what [...] was doing," [...] and reprinted material without obtaining permission, including a review of Cannonball Run II. He added: [...] "I like to think that Army Man was somewhere between a real publication and a very irresponsible, lawbreaking zine." [...] Army Man gained a strong following and was listed on Rolling Stones [...] "Hot List" [...] in 1989. Meyer noted: [...] "The only rule was that the stuff had to be funny and pretty short. To me, the quintessential Army Man joke was one of John Swartzwelder's: 'They can kill the Kennedys. Why can't they make a cup of coffee that tastes good?' It's <b>a</b> <b>horrifying</b> idea juxtaposed with something really banal-and yet there's a kind of logic to it. It's illuminating because it's kind of how Americans see things: Life's a big jumble, but somehow it leads to something I can consume. I love that." [...] Meyer suspended publication with the third issue, after offers to take the magazine national made him fear that it would lose its best qualities. According to The Believer: [...] "In comedy circles, [...] taken on almost mythological proportions." [...] This was met with varying reactions from Meyer, who felt [...] "embarrassed when people build it up as this monumental work of comedy. It was just a silly little escapade, never meant to be enshrined." ...|$|E

2500|$|Protectionist groups, {{such as the}} Indian Rights Association {{as well as the}} Office of Indian Affairs, {{criticized the}} hiring of Native American {{performers}} on several grounds.

[...] Reformers insisted that the supposed savagery of Native Americans needed to undergo the effects of civilization through land ownership, education, and industry. The logic of the reformers insisted that once Indians adopted new lifestyles, they would progress to a level approximating civilization.|$|E

2500|$|For over a decade, car No. 31 was Childress's R car. It {{debuted in}} 1988 at the fall event at North Carolina Speedway, as No. 22 and Rodney Combs driving, {{finishing}} dead last.

[...] The car wasn't seen again until 1993, as No. 31 and Earnhardt's longtime friend Neil Bonnett driving at Talladega Superspeedway. In this race, Bonnett, already on a comeback, was involved in <b>a</b> <b>horrifying</b> accident, but made it out okay. After driving another race in the season finale at Atlanta Motor Speedway as a start and park entry that year for RCR, Bonnett died testing Phoenix Racing's No. 51 Country Time Lemonade car for the 1994 Daytona 500.|$|E
2500|$|By the 1970s, Harlan Ellison even {{described}} dystheism {{as a bit}} of {{a science}} fiction cliché.

Lester del Rey's [...] "Evensong" [...] (the first story in Harlan Ellison's much-acclaimed Dangerous Visions anthology), {{tells the story of a}} fugitive God hunted down across the universe by a vengeful humanity which seeks to [...] "put him in his place". [...] "Faith of Our Fathers" [...] by Philip K. Dick, also from the same anthology, features <b>a</b> <b>horrifying</b> vision of a being, possibly God, who is all-devouring and amoral.
