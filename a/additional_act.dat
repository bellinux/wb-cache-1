5|$|The Reactionary Party (the former {{dissident}} conservative {{elements within}} the Moderate Party) began by passing the Interpretation of the <b>Additional</b> <b>Act,</b> which {{was followed by the}} reform of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Both laws, built upon the 1834 <b>Additional</b> <b>Act,</b> would allow the national government to reassert its control over provincial police and courts. They would provide the means to deal effectively with provincial rebellions and inevitably grant the national government greater sway over the provincial governments. In turn, the party in power would gain greater ascendancy in national politics through patronage and office appointments. Fearful that their adversaries would stay in power indefinitely, the Liberals began to call for PedroII to attain majority at a younger age. They hoped to regain their influence by doing away with the regency and dealing directly with a pliable young emperor. Towards that end, the Liberals allied themselves with the Facção Áulica (Courtier Faction), led by Aureliano Coutinho (Feijó's ally in the 1832 coup attempt).|$|E
5|$|With the 1834 {{constitutional}} amendment {{known as the}} <b>Additional</b> <b>Act,</b> Provincial General Councils were supplanted by the Assembleias Legislativas Provinciais (Provincial Legislative Assemblies). The new Assemblies enjoyed much greater autonomy from the national government.

5|$|The hamstrung Regency proved {{unable to}} resolve {{disputes}} and rivalries between {{national and local}} political factions. Believing that granting provincial and local governments greater autonomy would quell the growing dissent, the General Assembly passed a constitutional amendment in 1834, called the Ato Adicional (<b>Additional</b> <b>Act).</b> Instead of ending the chaos, these new powers only fed local ambitions and rivalries. Violence erupted throughout the country. Local parties competed with renewed ferocity to dominate provincial and municipal governments, as whichever party dominated the provinces would also gain control over the electoral and political system. Those parties which lost elections rebelled and tried to assume power by force, resulting in several rebellions.|$|E

5|$|The câmara {{municipal}} (town council) was {{the governing}} body in {{towns and cities}} and had existed in Brazil {{since the beginning of}} the colonial period in the 16th century. The Chamber was composed of vereadores (councilmen), the number of which depended on the size of the town. Unlike the Provincial General Council, the Constitution gave town councils great autonomy. However, when the Provincial Assembly replaced the Provincial General Council in 1834, many of the powers of town councils (including the setting of municipal budgets, oversight of expenditures, creation of jobs, and the nomination of civil servants) were transferred to the provincial government. Additionally, any laws enacted by the town council had to be ratified by the Provincial Assembly—but not by Parliament. While the 1834 <b>Additional</b> <b>Act</b> granted greater autonomy to the provinces from the central government, it transferred the towns' remaining autonomy to the provincial governments. There was no office of mayor, and towns were governed by a town council and its president (who was the councilman who won the most votes during elections).|$|E
5|$|Several rebellions erupted {{during the}} regency. The first were the Rebellion of Santa Rita (1831), the Revolt of the Year of the Smoke (1833) and the Cabanada (or War of the Cabanos, 1832–34), which sought {{the return of}} Pedro I and which {{had the support of}} common people, former slaves, and slaves. The death of Pedro I on 24 September 1834 ended their hopes. The {{promulgation}} of the <b>Additional</b> <b>Act</b> in 1834, a constitutional amendment that gave higher administrative and political provincial decentralization, exacerbated conflicts between political parties, as whichever dominated the provinces would also gain control over the electoral and political system. Those parties which lost elections rebelled and tried to assume power by force. Rebellious factions, however, continued to uphold the Throne as a way of giving the appearance of legitimacy to their actions (that is, they were not in revolt against the monarchy per se). The Cabanagem (1835–40), the Sabinada (1837–38) and the Balaiada (1838–41) all followed this course, even though in some instances provinces attempted to secede and become independent republics (though ostensibly only so long as Pedro II was a minor). The exception was the Ragamuffin War, which began as yet another dispute between political factions in the province of Rio Grande do Sul but quickly evolved into a separatist rebellion financed by the Argentine dictator Don Manuel Rosas. But even in this case, the majority of the province's population, including the largest and most prosperous cities, remained loyal to the Empire.|$|E

In October 1786, the Virginia General Assembly passed an act establishing the public ferry at Parsons' property near the present site of the U.S. Route 50 bridge west of Romney. The assembly's act set the ferry's toll at three pence and three farthings per man, and the same price per horse. By 1790, Parsons was continuing the operation of the ferry, which had become known as [...] "Parson's Ferry". On December 26, 1792, the Virginia General Assembly passed an <b>additional</b> <b>act</b> for the settlement and regulation of public ferries.

The power to approve or suspend resolutions of provincial councils was extraordinary, it was the competence of the General Assembly and could only occur if that body, for some reason, was unable to meet (This prerogative was annulled by the 1834 <b>Additional</b> <b>Act</b> and the subsequent creation of the Provincial Assemblies).|$|E

2500|$|The {{imperial}} Constitution of 1824 made Brazil {{a highly}} centralized country, aiming to facilitate control {{by the central}} government over the provinces and thereby prevent eventual territorial desmemberment. Nonetheless, the local governments had a certain autonomy, because municipal assemblies elected by the population had their own prerogatives. This framework would be changed when the 1840 <b>Additional</b> <b>Act</b> created the Provincial Assemblies to legislate on issues related to local administration. The Act also created an [...] "economic and local government" [...] that made possible to cities to [...] "neutralize {{in a certain way}} the absolute power exercised over the provinces by their presidents". A supposed reversal occurred in this area due to the [...] Law of Interpretation, which would have restricted the autonomy gained by the 1834 Act.

2500|$|Nonetheless, {{even after}} the {{revision}} of 1840, the Brazilian State retained certain characteristics of federalism, {{despite the fact that}} these were not foreseen in its founding in 1822. Because federalism was the principal change proposed by the republicans in the 19th century, scholars of the subject give the impression that federalism did not exist under the monarchy. William H. Riker, one of the main theoreticians about federalism, considered that the Brazilian monarchy adopted a federalist model after the 1834 <b>Additional</b> <b>Act.</b> His view is that federalism would consist of a [...] "division of competencies between the general [...] government and the regional governments." [...] The principal characteristic of federation is the mutual existence of two autonomous levels of government, in this case central and regional. This was reality during the monarchy, which would be considered a de facto federation {{were it not for the}} fact of the presidents of the provinces (same as governors of states) being appointed by the Emperor and the Senator having a lifelong tenure. The prussian officer Max von Versen who visited Brazil in 1867 wrote that the Emperor [...] "shares the sovereignty with a Senate and a Chamber of Deputies [...] that are assemblies elected by universal suffrage. In fact the Crown does have only the ability to execute decisions of the Legislative. It is so great the administrative autonomy of the provinces, so predominant is the function of the Parliament as it is small the sphere of political attributions of the Emperor".
