The organisms included 217 Bacteroides fragilis group strains, 137 non-B. fragilis group Bacteroides spp., and 40 fusobacteria. All strains <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> to piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, and meropenem.

For the beta-lactamase-positive fusobacteria, {{greater than or equal}} to 97 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> to amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, cefoperazone-sulbactam, trospectomycin, and cefoxitin, 90 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> to cefotetan, and 89 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> to tosufloxacin. All agents showed excellent activity against beta-lactamase-negative strains (for trospectomycin, 95 % were susceptible; for all other drugs, 100 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible).</b> Overall, both carbapenems and piperacillin-tazobactam were most active. Amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, and cefoperazone-sulbactam lacked activity against some cefoxitin-resistant B. fragilis group strains but had excellent activity against other organisms. Tosufloxacin, a new quinolone, had very good activity against B. fragilis group strains (94 % susceptible), good activity against other beta-lactamase-positive strains (less than or equal 85 % susceptible), and excellent activity against beta-lactamase-negative strains (100 % susceptible; MIC for 90 % of strains, 0. 5 microgram/ml). Trospectomycin was active against > 90 % of all strains except for B. fragilis group strains (88 % susceptible; MIC for 90 % of strains, 32 microgram/ml).

40|$|The susceptibilities of Streptococcus pneumoniae (1, 476 strains) and untypeable Haemophilus influenzae (1, 676 strains) {{to various}} oral β-lactam, macrolide-azalide, and {{fluoroquinolone}} antimicrobial agents {{were determined by}} broth microdilution. Organisms were isolated from specimens obtained from outpatients in six geographic regions of the United States. MIC data were interpreted according to pharmacodynamically derived breakpoints applicable to the oral agents tested. Among H. influenzae strains, 41. 6 % were β-lactamase positive. Virtually all H. influenzae strains <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> to amoxicillin-clavulanate (98 %), cefixime (100 %), and ciprofloxacin (100 %), while 78 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> to cefuroxime, 57 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> to amoxicillin, 14 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> to cefprozil, 9 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> to loracarbef, 2 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> to cefaclor, and 0 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> to azithromycin and clarithromycin.

Although ciprofloxacin has marginal activity against S. pneumoniae, no high-level fluoroquinolone-resistant strains were found. Significant cross-resistance was found between penicillin and macrolides-azalides among S. pneumoniae isolates, with 5 % of the penicillin-susceptible strains being macrolide-azalide resistant, compared with 37 % of the intermediate isolates and 66 % of the resistant isolates. Resistance was highest in S. pneumoniae isolates from patients younger than 10 years of age, middle ear and paranasal sinus specimens, and the southern half of the United States.

40|$|Objective: This study {{compared}} {{the activity of}} ceftolozane–tazobactam and ceftazidime–avibactam against 120 bacterial strains, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, isolated from patients admitted to Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Methods: In vitro susceptibility was tested using the Etest strip minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method, and PCR was used to characterize the carbapenemase enzymes produced by CRE strains. Results: All 29 ESBL isolates <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> to ceftazidime–avibactam (MIC 50 0. 125  μg/ml), whereas all but one <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> to ceftolozane–tazobactam (MIC 50 0. 38  μg/ml). Twenty-seven (45 %) CRE isolates <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> to ceftazidime–avibactam (MIC 50 ≥ 256  μg/ml), whereas only six (10 %) isolates <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> to ceftolozane–tazobactam (MIC 50 ≥ 256  μg/ml). Very few NDM- 1 isolates <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> to ceftazidime–avibactam, whereas the majority of OXA- 48 isolates <b>were</b> <b>susceptible.</b> Twenty-nine (94 %) P. aeruginosa isolates <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> to ceftazidime–avibactam (MIC 50 1. 5  μg/ml), whereas 30 (97 %) isolates <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> to ceftolozane–tazobactam (MIC 50 0. 75  μg/ml). Conclusions: Ceftolozane–tazobactam and ceftazidime–avibactam showed comparable activity against ESBL and P. aeruginosa, with ceftazidime–avibactam having lower MICs against ESBL isolates and ceftolozane–tazobactam having lower MICs against P. aeruginosa.

40|$|The {{number of}} strains of Proteus studied was 413, {{and these were}} {{obtained}} from all clinical materials {{with the exception of}} fecal specimens. Lactose was fermented by 37 strains (P. inconstans, 29 %; P. rettgeri, 16 %; P. mirabilis, 4. 2 %; P. morganii, 3. 6 %; and P. vulgaris, 0 %) of which 33 were from the genitourinary system. These 33 strains constituted 12. 7 % of the 260 strains isolated from this source. Biochemically, P. mirabilis was the least variable, and P. rettgeri was the most variable of the five species of Proteus tested. P. inconstans and P. rettgeri resembled each other more closely {{than any of the other}} species of Proteus. Comparison of results obtained in the Memphis area with those found in other locations showed that biochemical characteristics varied most with the substances citrate, salicin, xylose, trehalose, and mannitol. In contrast to earlier reports from Israel and England, none of the strains of P. inconstans in the present study was able to attack urea. All five species of Proteus tested (by the disc method) <b>were</b> highly <b>susceptible</b> to methenamine mandelate. P. mirabilis, P. morganii, and P. vulgaris <b>were</b> also highly <b>susceptible</b> to nitrofurantoin. All strains of P. mirabilis <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> to ampicillin.
