5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} {{has been}} more broadly described <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> adjust one’s thinking from old situations to new situations as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> overcome responses or thinking that have become habitual and adapt to new situations. As such, if one is able to overcome previously held beliefs or habits (when it is required for new situations) then they would be considered cognitively flexible. Lastly, the ability to simultaneously consider two aspects of an object, idea, or situation {{at one point in}} time refers to cognitive flexibility. According to this definition, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if they can sort cards based on the color of the objects and type of objects on the card simultaneously. Similarly, cognitive flexibility has been defined as having the understanding and awareness of all possible options and alternatives simultaneously within any given situation.|$|E

5|$|Aquaria is a 2D sidescrolling action-adventure game, heavily {{focused on}} {{exploration}} and puzzle-solving, with non-linear gameplay. The player controls Naija, a lone underwater dweller; although {{similar to a}} human woman, Naija also has several fish-like qualities, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> breathe underwater and propel herself quickly with webbed feet. The game, originally only available for personal computers, {{was designed to be}} primarily controlled solely through the mouse, though it can also be controlled with a keyboard or Xbox 360 controller. The player directs Naija through an underwater world composed of several distinct regions, ranging from caves to underwater ruins to sunlit oases. These areas are filled with plant and animal life, which can be hostile, friendly, or neutral towards her. Hostile plants and animals can hurt Naija, reducing her health meter, by touching her or firing projectiles at her.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{executive}} {{power in the}} EU isn't concentrated in a single institution. It becomes clearer under the Lisbon Treaty with {{the division of the}} European Council as a distinct institution with a fixed President. This arrangement has been compared to the dual executive system found in the French republic where there is a President (the Council President) and Prime Minister (the Commission President). However, unlike the French model, the Council President does not hold formal powers such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> directly appoint and sack the other, or the ability to dissolve Parliament. Hence while the Council President may have prestige, it would lack power and while the Commission President would have power, it would lack the prestige of the former.|$|E

Revenge retained Takedowns {{but continued to}} evolve the aggressive style of driving by introducing new features such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> knock traffic {{out of the way}} and into opponents. With Revenge, Criterion wanted to set the game on its own path rather than just recreate Burnout 3 again. Ward admitted that later Burnout games may not have recaptured the same quintessential feeling that Burnout 3 did. He considered Burnout 3 to be the game that he was most proud of working on and high point for the studio.|$|E

Other offline modes include Versus Mode, where two players can fight against each other locally; Training Mode, which features several customization options for training purposes, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> adjust the Hyper Combo gauge, set AI difficulty, record and playback moves, and even simulate input lag; and Mission Mode, which features character-specific challenges designed to test players {{on their ability to}} execute complex combos.|$|E
5|$|Needy decides {{she must}} kill Jennifer. She goes to Jennifer's home and sees her, already recovered, picking out her next victims in her yearbook.

Jennifer's mother enters and finds Needy with the box cutter {{on top of her}} daughter's body. Soon after, Needy is brought to an asylum. As she was bitten non-fatally by Jennifer, she manifests some of Jennifer's supernatural powers, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> hover in the air. Desiring revenge for what was done to her, Jennifer, and Chip, Needy escapes the mental facility and hitchhikes a ride to the hotel where Low Shoulder are staying; there, she slaughters the members, whose killings are later discovered by local authorities.|$|E

StarCraft: Ghost includes many of the vehicle units featured in StarCraft and StarCraft: Brood War.

Nevertheless, devices like the telephone system were originally advertised with an emphasis on the practical dimensions of the device (such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> conduct business or order home services) as opposed to the social dimensions. It was not until the late 1920s and 1930s that the social dimensions of the device became a prominent theme in telephone advertisements. New promotions started appealing to consumers' emotions, stressing the importance of social conversations and staying connected to family and friends.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} {{decided to}} return to a gameplay style similar to the original Genesis Sonic games, which producer Yuji Naka felt was refreshing. Despite this, they also included concepts that were incorporated in the Dreamcast games, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> grind on rails and and the modernized character designs by Yuji Uekawa. As the Sonic games released for the Dreamcast allowed players to download the Chao Garden minigame onto the VMU, the development team decided to expand upon this idea by implementing a similar minigame that was compatible with the GameCube's GBA link cable, thus making Sonic Advance one of the first games {{to make use of the}} cable. It also makes use of graphical techniques such as rotation effects and Mode 7. The game's musical score was composed by Yutaka Minobe and Tatsuyuki Maeda.|$|E
5|$|To {{mark the}} game's fifteenth anniversary, a port for the Game Boy Advance, titled Sonic the Hedgehog Genesis, was {{released}} on November 14, 2006.

This version of the game, unlike others, received poor reviews, with a Metacritic score of 33/100. The chief complaints concerned its poor conversion to the Game Boy Advance, resulting in a bad performance and poor implementation of the original music and gameplay.|$|E

Following financial investment, new club president John Henry Davies paid £500 for the erection of a new 1,000-seat stand at Bank Street. Within four years, the stadium had cover on all four sides, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> hold approximately 50,000 spectators, some of whom could watch from the viewing gallery atop the Main Stand.|$|E
5|$|Dishonored {{features}} role-playing game elements, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> upgrade {{powers and}} to make moral choices {{with a focus on}} non-linear consequences. The game is designed to allow the player to complete it without killing any non-player characters (NPC), including boss characters and mission targets. An example of a non-lethal situation given by co-creative designer Harvey Smith involved the player completing a side mission for a character, and in return that character had two of Corvo's targets kidnapped and enslaved. Each mission contains multiple ways to explore and reach targets. Movement through and exploration of levels is designed to support the player character's abilities, rather than specific paths that are aimed at a particular gameplay style, such as hacking or sneaking. Specific elements of missions, such as changes to the color of a target's clothing and mask in one mission are randomized, requiring the player to explore the game area to find the target each time the mission is played.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} settlement, Augustus was also granted {{the power of}} a tribune (tribunicia potestas) for life, though not the {{official}} title of tribune. For some years, Augustus had been awarded tribunicia sacrosanctitas, the immunity given to a Tribune of the Plebs. Now he decided to assume the full powers of the magistracy, renewed annually, in perpetuity. Legally, it was closed to patricians, a status that Augustus had acquired some years earlier when adopted by Julius Caesar. This power allowed him to convene the Senate and people at will and lay business before them, to veto the actions of either the Assembly or the Senate, to preside over elections, and to speak first at any meeting. Also included in Augustus' tribunician authority were powers usually reserved for the Roman censor; these included the right to supervise public morals and scrutinize laws to ensure that they were in the public interest, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> hold a census and determine the membership of the Senate.|$|E
