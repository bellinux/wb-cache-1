Henderson's impact was noticeable on José Reyes, the Mets' former leadoff hitter. [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> around the game", Henderson said in May 2007. [...] "That's something that's in my blood. Helping them have success feels just as good." ...|$|E
500|$|An early {{title for}} the album was When All Is Said and Done More Is Said Than Done, {{suggested}} by Fazzi. The group liked it, however, Fazzi said it was [...] "way too long to fit on a side of a CD". According to Lazzara, the album was given the title New Again because [...] "that's what it feels like. We are in a totally different band, just {{because there has been}} this new life breathed into the band with the addition of Matt." [...] The album was written in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Here, Rubano said the group [...] "stuck out on the street because we were so loud". For the album, the band embraced the concept that [...] "it's up to us to decide what Taking Back Sunday sounds like. We <b>always</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> redefining what that means, and there's stuff on this record I think in the past we would have stayed away from", according to Rubano. Fazzi said the group wanted to [...] "put a new foot forward ... to show people that we're expanding the music". He noted that the song structures and chord patterns were [...] "just a bit stronger and smarter".|$|E

However, Wrangler always considered himself homosexual. [...] "I'm not bisexual and I'm not straight", Wrangler later said. [...] "I'm gay, but I could never live a gay lifestyle, because I'm much too competitive. When I was with a guy I would <b>always</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> better than him: what we were accomplishing, what we were wearing—anything. With a woman you compete like crazy, but coming from different points of view, {{and as far as}} I'm concerned, that was doable." ...|$|E

The new owners intend to make several improvements, including adding a podcast studio. [...] They hope to begin recording Tony's podcast at Chatter starting May 1, 2017. Kornheiser is quoted as saying, [...] "Did I <b>always</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> part of a restaurant? No. But now with a podcast and trying to own my own content, the ability {{to put it on}} during the mornings or during the day and to have other people use it, that would be fun for me." ...|$|E

"Because, my dear, both {{history and}} {{observation}} teach us that great gifts like yours partake {{of the character}} of an accident in a woman; they are not natural to her, and she does not wear such jewels easily --they put her outside of her sex.

Darling, mother not only consents, she wants you to be my wife. Do you hear that? And listen--she had me in a corner and, of course, being my mother, she put on the screws.
