5|$|Ariel first {{appears in}} The Little Mermaid (1989), {{in which she}} is shown as being adventurous and curious <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of humans, a fascination which angers both her father King Triton and his court {{composer}} Sebastian, as merfolk {{are not allowed to}} make contact with the human world. She and Flounder go in search of human objects, which they take to a seagull named Scuttle for appraisal. Ariel {{falls in love with a}} human prince named Prince Eric after saving him from drowning, and visits the sea witch, Ursula, who agrees to turn her into a human in exchange for her voice. Ariel must make Prince Eric fall in love with her and romantically kiss her within three days, lest she belong to Ursula forever.|$|E
5|$|Commonsense {{knowledge}} and reasoning. Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply {{enormous amounts of}} information about the world: the program needs to have some idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database so large and no one knew how a program might learn so much information.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 1915 and 1916, Kropotkin, {{who lived}} in Brighton, England, was often in poor health. He was unable to travel during the winter, having been ordered {{not to do so}} by doctors in January 1915, and {{underwent}} two operations to his chest in March. As a result, he was confined to a bed for the majority of 1915 and to a wheeled bath-chair in 1916. During this time, Kropotkin kept a steady correspondence with other anarchists, including fellow Russian anarchist Marie Goldsmith. Goldsmith and Kropotkin clashed often on their opinions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> War, the role of internationalism during the conflict, and whether it was possible to advocate antimilitarism during that period (early 1916). As explained above, Kropotkin took firmly pro-war positions during these communiques, as he was predisposed to frequently criticize the German Empire.|$|E

5|$|When Richard {{was five}} years old, his mother {{gave birth to a}} younger brother, Henry Philips, who died at four weeks of age on February 25, 1924. Four years later, Richard's sister Joan was born, and the family moved to Far Rockaway, Queens. Though {{separated}} by nine years, Joan and Richard were close, as they both shared a natural curiosity <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Their mother thought that women did not have the cranial capacity to comprehend such things. Despite their mother's disapproval of Joan's desire to study astronomy, Richard encouraged his sister to explore the universe. Joan eventually became an astrophysicist specializing in interactions between the Earth and the solar wind.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Cooper {{struggled}} with health problems. As {{well as his}} ongoing treatment for ulcers, he suffered a severe shoulder injury during the filming of Blowing Wild when {{he was hit by}} metal fragments from a dynamited oil well. During the filming of Vera Cruz, he reinjured his hip falling from a horse, and was burned when Lancaster fired his rifle too close and the wadding from the blank shell pierced his clothing. In 1955, he appeared in Otto Preminger's biographical war drama The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell, <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> War I general who tried to convince government officials of the importance of air power, and was court-martialed after blaming the War Department for a series of air disasters. Some critics felt that Cooper was miscast, and that his dull, tight-lipped performance did not reflect Mitchell's dynamic and caustic personality. In 1956, Cooper was more effective playing a gentle Indiana Quaker in William Wyler's Civil War drama Friendly Persuasion with Dorothy McGuire. Like Sergeant York and High Noon, the film addresses the conflict between religious pacifism and civic duty. For his performance, Cooper received his second Golden Globe nomination for Best Motion Picture Actor. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, was awarded the Palme d'Or at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival, and went on to earn $8 million worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} {{directly}} controls the on-screen character from a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} people, objects, and enemies. Unlike previous games in the series, the player can also control the camera with the right analog stick, allowing for a 360° view of the surroundings. While in towns and cities, the player may only see {{from the perspective of}} Vaan, but any character may be controlled in the field. The world of Final Fantasy XII is rendered to scale relative to the characters in it; instead of a caricature of the character roaming around miniature terrain, as found in the earlier Final Fantasy games, every area is represented proportionally. The player navigates the overworld on foot, Chocobo, or by airship. Players may save their game to a memory card using save crystals or gate crystals, and may use the latter to teleport between gate crystals. An in-game bestiary provides incidental information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of Final Fantasy XII.|$|E

5|$|When {{accessing}} {{a previously}} visited region, the player {{appears in the}} location of their last visit. Upon acquiring items called seals, the player can revert regions to their previous statuses to play through them again; regions can be unsealed again at any time. Unlike in the predecessor, the game is automatically saved when players enter the Historia Crux, {{as well as at}} key moments in the plot. The player may also manually save at any time. Instead of accessing stores at save points like in XIII, the player can purchase items from a character named Chocolina, who is found throughout the game. An in-game data log provides a bestiary and incidental information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of Final Fantasy XIII-2. When talking to characters, the game sometimes begins the Live Trigger system, in which the player chooses their response from several options; these dialogue options are generally not repeatable. The game also occasionally features temporal rifts, in which the player must complete a puzzle to close the rift and continue the game.|$|E

5000|$|This {{approach}} has become popular with psychologists as {{it gives a}} basis from which to explore human social understanding. Beginning in the mid-1980s, several influential developmental psychologists began advocating the theory theory: the view that humans learn {{through a process of}} theory revision closely resembling the way scientists propose and revise theories. Children observe <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> and in doing so, gather data <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>world's</b> true structure. As more data accumulates, children can revise their naive theories accordingly. Children can also use these theories <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>world's</b> causal structure to make predictions, and possibly even test them out. [...] This concept is described as the 'Child Scientist' theory, proposing that a series of personal scientific revolutions are required for the development of theories <b>about</b> <b>the</b> outside <b>world,</b> including <b>the</b> social <b>world.</b>|$|R
