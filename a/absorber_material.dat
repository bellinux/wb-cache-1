The first generation cells—also called conventional, traditional or wafer-based cells—are made of crystalline silicon, the commercially predominant PV technology, that includes materials such as polysilicon and monocrystalline silicon. Second generation cells are thin film solar cells, that include amorphous silicon, CdTe and CIGS cells and are commercially significant in utility-scale photovoltaic power stations, building integrated photovoltaics or in small stand-alone power system. The third generation of solar cells includes a number of thin-film technologies often described as emerging photovoltaics—most of them {{have not yet been}} commercially applied and are still in the research or development phase. Many use organic materials, often organometallic compounds as well as inorganic substances. Despite the fact that their efficiencies had been low and the stability of the <b>absorber</b> <b>material</b> was often too short for commercial applications, {{there is a lot of}} research invested into these technologies as they promise to achieve the goal of producing low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells.|$|E

5000|$|The {{divertor}} {{was initially}} introduced during the earliest studies of fusion power {{systems in the}} 1950s.

Operating on the same principle as a mass spectrometer, the plasma passes through the divertor region where heavier ions are flung out of the fuel mass by centrifugal force, colliding with some sort of <b>absorber</b> <b>material,</b> and depositing its energy as heat.

However, if PVs are to make a significant contribution to satisfy global energy requirements, issues of sustainability and cost will need to be addressed with increased urgency.

Recently, a 3.4% bifacial device, using In substituted CZTS (CZTIS) <b>absorber</b> <b>material</b> and transparent conducting back contact was reported in 2014, which can produce photocurrent {{on either side of}} illumination; later, the device efficiency based on this bifacial configuration has been boosted to 5.8% in 2016.

50|$|Saturable {{absorption}} is {{a property}} of materials where {{the absorption of}} light decreases with increasing light intensity. Most materials show some saturable absorption, but often only at very high optical intensities (close to the optical damage). At sufficiently high incident light intensity, atoms in the ground state of a saturable <b>absorber</b> <b>material</b> become excited into an upper energy state at such a rate that there is insufficient {{time for them to}} decay back to the ground state before the ground state becomes depleted, and the absorption subsequently saturates. Saturable absorbers are useful in laser cavities. The key parameters for a saturable absorber are its wavelength range (where it absorbs), its dynamic response (how fast it recovers), and its saturation intensity and fluence (at what intensity or pulse energy it saturates). They are commonly used for passive Q-switching.|$|E

50|$|All {{light with}} energy {{greater than the}} band gap of the {{material}} can be absorbed, {{though there is a}} trade-off to reducing the band gap as photons absorbed with energies higher than the band gap will thermally give off its excess energy, resulting in lower voltages and power conversion efficiencies. When these materials absorb a photon, an excited state is created and confined to a molecule or a region of a polymer chain. The excited state can be regarded as an exciton, or an electron-hole pair bound together by electrostatic interactions. In photovoltaic cells, excitons are broken up into free electron-hole pairs by effective fields. The effective fields are set up by creating a heterojunction between two dissimilar materials. In organic photovoltaics, effective fields break up excitons by causing the electron to fall from the conduction band of the absorber to the conduction band of the acceptor molecule. It is necessary that the acceptor material has a conduction band edge that is lower than that of the <b>absorber</b> <b>material.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The water-solubility of {{the organic}} {{constituent}} of the <b>absorber</b> <b>material</b> make devices highly prone to rapid degradation in moist environments. The degradation which is caused by moisture can be reduced by optimizing the constituent materials, {{the architecture of the}} cell, the interfaces and the environment conditions during the fabrication steps. [...] Encapsulating the perovskite absorber with a composite of carbon nanotubes and an inert polymer matrix has been demonstrated to successfully prevent the immediate degradation of the material when exposed to moist ambient air at elevated temperatures. However, no long term studies and comprehensive encapsulation techniques have yet been demonstrated for perovskite solar cells. Besides moisture instability, it has also been shown that the embodiment of devices in which a mesoporous TiO2 layer is sensitized with the perovskite absorber exhibits UV light induced instability. The cause for the observed decline in device performance of those solar cells is linked to the interaction between photogenerated holes inside the TiO2 and oxygen radicals on the surface of TiO2.The measured ultra low thermal conductivity of 0.5 W/(Km) at room temperature in CH3NH3PbI3 can prevent fast propagation of the light deposited heat, and keep the cell resistive on thermal stresses that can reduce its life time. The PbI2 residue in perovskite film has been experimentally demonstrated to {{have a negative effect on}} the long-term stability of devices. The stabilization problem is claimed to be solved by replacing the organic transport layer with a metal oxide layer, allowing the cell to retain 90% capacity after 60 days. Besides, the two instabilities issues can be solved by using multifunctional fluorinated photopolymer coatings that confer luminescent and easy-cleaning features on the front side of the devices, while concurrently forming a strongly hydrophobic barrier toward environmental moisture on the back contact side. The front coating can prevent the UV light of the whole incident solar spectrum from negatively interacting with the PSC stack by converting it into visible light, and the back layer can prevent water from permeation within the solar cell stack. The resulting devices demonstrated excellent stability in terms of power conversion efficiencies during a 180-day aging test in the lab and a real outdoor condition test for more than 3 months.|$|E
