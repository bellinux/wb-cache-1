40|$|Objectives. To {{describe}} the new drugs marketed in Brazil {{during the period}} 2000 – 2004, compare the description to the country’s burden of disease, and suggest initiatives capable of addressing the situation {{from the perspective of}} a developing country. Methods. Records of new drugs were surveyed in an official drug registration database. The new drugs were categorized by Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification, indication, and innovation, and compared with the needs of the country’s burden of disease. Data on the morbidity and mortality rates of selected diseases (diabetes, Hansen’s disease, hypertension, tuberculosis) were retrieved from official documents and the literature. Results. During the period investigated, 109 new drugs were launched. Most were general anti-infectives for systemic use (19), followed by <b>antineoplastic</b> <b>and</b> <b>immunomodulating</b> <b>agents</b> (16). The number of new drugs launched in 2004 was roughly one-third that of 2000. Of 65 new drugs, only one-third can be classified as innovative. Most new drugs were in-tended to treat noninfectious diseases that typically affect developed countries, diseases that constitute only a fraction of the country’s challenges. Conclusions.

40|$|Background: Managed entry {{agreements}} (MEAs) are a set {{of instruments}} to facilitate access to new medicines. This study surveyed the implementation of MEAs in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) where limited comparative information is currently available. Method: We conducted a survey on the implementation of MEAs in CEE between January-March 2017. Results: Sixteen countries participated in this study. Across five countries with available data {{on the number of}} different MEA instruments implemented, the most common MEAs implemented were confidential discounts (n= 495, 73 %), followed by paybacks (n= 92, 14 %), price-volume agreements (n= 37, 5 %), free doses (n= 25, 4 %), bundle and other agreements (n= 19, 3 %), and payment by result (n= 10, > 1 %). Across seven countries with data on MEAs by therapeutic group, the highest number of brand names associated with one or more MEA instruments belonged to the ATC-L group, <b>antineoplastic</b> <b>and</b> <b>immunomodulating</b> <b>agents</b> (n= 201, 31 %). The second most frequent therapeutic group for MEA implementation was ATC-A, alimentary tract and metabolism (n= 87, 13 %), followed by medicines for neurological conditions (n= 83, 13 %). Conclusion: Experience in implementing MEAs varied substantially across the region and there is considerable scope for greater transparency, sharing experiences and mutual learning. European citizens, authorities and industry should ask themselves whether within public health systems confidential discounts can still be tolerated, particularly when it is not clear which country and party they are really benefiting. Further, if MEAs are to improve access, countries should establish clear objectives for their implementation and a monitoring framework to measure their performance as well as the burden of implementation...|$|E

40|$|The {{costs of}} {{medicines}} pose a growing burden on healthcare systems worldwide. A comprehensive understanding of current procurement processes provides {{strong support for}} the development of effective policies. This study examined Brazilian Federal Government pharmaceutical procurement data provided by the Integrated System for the Administration of General Services (SIASG) database, from 2006 to 2013. Medicine purchases were aggregated by volume and expenditure for each year. Data on expenditure were adjusted for inflation using the Extended National Consumer Price Index (IPCA) for December 31, 2013. Lorenz distribution curves were used to study the cumulative proportion of purchased therapeutic classes. Expenditure variance analysis was performed to determine the impact of each factor, price and/or volume, on total expenditure variation. Annual expenditure on medicines increased 2. 72 times, while the purchased volume of drugs increased 1. 99 times. A limited number of therapeutic classes dominated expenditure each year. Drugs for infectious diseases drove the increase in expenditures from 2006 to 2009 but were replaced by <b>antineoplastic</b> <b>and</b> <b>immunomodulating</b> <b>agents</b> beginning in 2010. Immunosuppressants (L 04), accounted for one third of purchases since 2010, showing the most substantial growth in expenditures during the period (250 -fold increase). The overwhelming price-related increase in expenditures caused by these medicines is bound to have a relevant impact on the sustainability of the pharmaceutical supply system. We observed increasing trends in expenditures, especially in specific therapeutic classes. We propose {{the development and implementation of}} better medicine procurement systems, and strategies to allow for monitoring of product price, effectiveness, and safety.

40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} and analyze {{specific aspects of}} pharmacoeconomic research and application in 10 Asian countries in recent years from 2003 to 2013. Methods: Our study concentrated on 10 Asian countries, including China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Literature was collected and reviewed systematically from United States National Library of Medicine- PubMed. Grey literature was also taken into account. After screening, a total of 268 pharmacoeconomic research articles and 38 pharmacoeconomic application studies were included. This review followed the Cochrane systematic review guidelines and PRISMA flow diagram. Publication was analyzed by regions, economic evaluation techniques used, drug groups analyzed. The status of these pharmacoeconomic studies was identified with options being: for scientific interest, undertaken to support reimbursement issues directly or performed {{in the framework of}} clinical guidelines or formularies. Results: There is an increasing in the number of pharmacoeconomic studies in Asian countries in the later period (2008 - 2013) compared with the first five years considered (2003 - 2007). Most pharmacoeconomic studies were carried out in Japan (26 %), China (22 %), Thailand (15 %), Taiwan (12 %) and South Korea (10 %).

40|$|Thesis (M. Pharm. (Pharmacy Practice)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. Cancer {{is a broad}} {{term used}} to {{describe}} more than 100 diseases that can affect {{any part of the}} body. Cancer is the uncontrollable division of abnormal cells in the human body, which can invade nearby tissue and spread through the bloodstream {{to other parts of the}} body (National Cancer Institute, 2007 b). Cancer can affect people all over the world, from every race, society and age (Albrecht, 2006 : 3). The treatment of cancer is becoming more and more expensive as newer and more effective drugs enter the market (Niezen et al., 2006 : 2887) and diagnosing and screening of cancer patients is showing remarkable progress (Meropol & Schulman, 2007 : 180). The general objective of this study was to investigate and review the prescribing patterns of <b>antineoplastic</b> <b>and</b> <b>immunomodulating</b> <b>agents</b> in a section of the private health care sector of South Africa. This research can be classified as retrospective and quantitative. Data were obtained from a medicine claims database, of a pharmacy benefit management company. The study population consisted of all prescriptions, containing one or more cancer medicine items (classified according to the ATC classification), for the study period January 2005 to December 2006. Different aspects of cancer were investigated in order to determine the international and national prevalence of cancer and types of cancer and cancer treatment. An overview of managed care aspects were given and through this study it is evident that pharmacoeconomic studies and other managed care aspects could play a major role as information system in the decision making about cancer treatments. The prescribing patterns of <b>antineoplastic</b> <b>and</b> <b>immunomodulating</b> <b>agents</b> were reviewed, analysed and interpreted. It was determined that the number of cancer patients, the number of prescriptions containing one of more cancer drug and the number of cancer medicine items respectively comprised less than 1 % of the total number of patients, prescriptions and medicine items recorded on the total database. To the contrary, the total cost of cancer medicine items comprised 4. 00 % and 5. 31 % of the total cost of all medicine items (total database) in 2005 and 2006 respectively. This indicates the relatively high cost of cancer medicine items. Almost 50 % of all cancer patients are 59 years of age or older and the total cost of cancer medicine items claimed by patients 59 years and older comprised almost 60 % of the total cost of all cancer medicine items claimed during the two study years respectively. Cancer medicine items claimed by patients < 19 years of age comprised only 2 % of all cancer medicine items claimed in both study years and less than 1 % of the total cost of all cancer medicine items. Cancer medicine items claimed by patients between the age of 19 and 59 years of age comprised 45. 32 % and 44. 80 % of the total number of cancer medicine items in 2005 and 2006 respectively whilst the cost for these age groups comprised 40. 81 % and 40. 73 % of the total cost of cancer medicine items. More than 70 % of all cancer patients in 2005 and 2006 were females whilst male cancer patients comprised about 30 % of all cancer patients. The number of cancer medicine items claimed by female cancer patients also comprised more than 70 % of the total number of cancer medicine items claimed in 2005 and 2006, however, the total cost of cancer medicine items was divided almost even between male (45 %) and female (55 %) cancer patients for both study years. Therefore, according to this study, cancer medicine items claimed by male cancer patients are relatively more expensive than those claimed by female cancer patients. In completion of this study, recommendations for further studies concerning cancer treatment and cost-effective usage of cancer medicine were formulated, including the influence of the nature of the cancer, the age and gender of the patients as well as the treatment costs of cancer.

Os medicamentos foram classificados de acordo com o Anatomical-Therapeutical-Chemical â ATC, Classification Index e as reaÃÃes adversas atravÃs do WHO-ART tambÃm recomendado pela OrganizaÃÃo Mundial da SaÃde. RESULTADOS: Foram internados nas clÃnicas mÃdicas do HUWC um total de 970 pacientes destes, 54 % eram mulheres e 46 % homens, com idade variando de 9 meses a 97 anos. Todos os pacientes fizeram uso de medicamentos durante a internaÃÃo, variando de 1 a 20 medicamentos/paciente. Os grupos de medicamentos mais utilizados, (1 &# 61616; nÃvel ATC) foram medicamentos que atuam no sistema nervoso central (19, 0 %), medicamentos que atuam sobre o trato alimentar e metabolismo (17, 0 %), medicamentos que atuam no sistema cardiovascular (16, 7 %). Do total, oito (0, 8 %) tiveram como diagnÃstico de internaÃÃo alguma reaÃÃo adversa a medicamento. Durante o perÃodo do estudo foram verificadas 30 novas ocorrÃncias de RAM em pacientes hospitalizados. As manifestaÃÃes das reaÃÃes adversas compreendiam principalmente afecÃÃes da pele (65, 0 %) e distÃrbios do estado geral (25, 0 %). Quanto Ã gravidade, as reaÃÃes foram na sua maioria classificadas como moderadas (79, 0 %), seguidas das reaÃÃes leves (19, 0 %). A relaÃÃo de causalidade foi considerada provÃvel em 58, 0 % dos casos e definida em 24, 5 %.

INTRODUCTION: Adverse drug reactions (ADR) constitute {{cause of}} morbidity in hospitalized patients, represent a risk for patients {{and an increase}} in the period patients stay in hospitals and the costs. OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of adverse drug reactions in the Walter CantÃdio University Hospital (WCUH), investigate what factors may be associated with these events and propose measures to prevent or reduce the negative impact of those reactions. METHODS: An observational, analytical, and prospective study, with intensive monitoring of patients, analysis of the cumulative incidence of ADR and an exploratory evaluation of its determinants. The study included all inpatients in the medical clinics of WCUH from September 1 st, 2000 to February 28 th 2001, which were assisted from admission until discharge or death, to detection and monitoring of adverse reaction. Daily calls were made to the clinics WCUH in order to register the use of drugs and the occurrence of ADR. Cases in which patients had ADRs were assessed according to the methodology proposed by the World Health Organization. The reactions were classified based on liability, severity and type. Drugs were classified according to the Anatomical-Therapeutical-Chemical (ATC), Classification Index and adverse reactions through the WHO-ART also recommended by the World Health Organization. RESULTS: 970 patients were admitted to the medical clinics of HUWC. Of those, 54 % were women and 46 % were men, ranging in age from 09 months to 97 years. All patients received medication during hospitalization, ranging from 1 to 20 drugs / patient. The most commonly used drug groups (1 st level ATC) are drugs that act on central nervous system (19. 0 %), drugs that act on the digestive tract and metabolism (17. 0 %), and drugs that act on the cardiovascular system (16. 7 %). Of the total, in eight (8 %) the diagnosis for admission was an adverse reaction to medication. During the study, 30 new cases of ADRs in inpatients were registered. The results of adverse reactions comprised mainly skin disorders (65. 0 %) and general disturbances (25. 0 %). About gravity, the reactions were mostly classified as moderate (79. 0 %), followed by mild reactions (19. 0 %). The relation of causality was considered probable in 58. 0 % of cases and set at 24. 5 %. Most involved pharmacological groups were antibiotics for systemic use (66. 4 %), followed by drugs that act on the nervous system (7. 7 %), <b>antineoplastic</b> <b>and</b> <b>immunomodulating</b> <b>agents</b> (7. 7 %). The incidence of ADR among inpatients is not associated with age or gender. The number of days of hospital admission interfered with the occurrence of RAM. CONCLUSION: Adverse reactions as cause of admission were identified. All inpatients with ADRs have skin manifestations. Antibiotics, especially cephalosporins, were drugs commonly involved with the occurrence of ADRs in inpatients...|$|E

40|$|The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) {{classification}} system, {{recommended by}} the World Health Organization, categories drugs into different classes according to their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. For a set of query compounds, how can we identify which ATC-class (or classes) they belong to? It is an important and challenging problem because the information thus obtained would be quite useful for drug development and utilization. By hybridizing the informations of chemical-chemical interactions and chemical-chemical similarities, a novel method was developed for such purpose. It was observed by the jackknife test on a benchmark dataset of 3, 883 drug compounds that the overall success rate achieved by the prediction method was about 73 % in identifying the drugs among the following 14 main ATC-classes: (1) alimentary tract and metabolism; (2) blood and blood forming organs; (3) cardiovascular system; (4) dermatologicals; (5) genitourinary system and sex hormones; (6) systemic hormonal preparations, excluding sex hormones and insulins; (7) anti-infectives for systemic use; (8) <b>antineoplastic</b> <b>and</b> <b>immunomodulating</b> agents; (9) musculoskeletal system; (10) nervous system; (11) antiparasitic products, insecticides and repellents; (12) respiratory system; (13) sensory organs; (14) various. Such a success rate is substantially higher than 7 % by the random guess. It has not escaped our notice that the current method can be straightforwardly extended to identify the drugs for their 2 (nd) -level, 3 (rd) -level, 4 (th) -level, and 5 (th) -level ATC-classifications once the statistically significant benchmark data are available for these lower levels...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{present the}} {{systematic}} literature review (SLR), which {{formed the basis}} for the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) evidence-based recommendations for vaccination in adult patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIIRD). Methods: AIIRD, vaccines <b>and</b> <b>immunomodulating</b> drugs, as well as eight key questions were defined by the multidisciplinary expert committee commissioned by EULAR for developing the recommendations. A SLR was performed using MedLine through October 2009 and including data from meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized trials, and observational studies, excluding case series with participants. Articles in English and regarding patients years of age, were eligible. Results: Several vaccine-preventable infections (VPI) occur more often in AIIRD-patients and most vaccines are efficacious in AIIRD-patients, even when treated with <b>immunomodulating</b> <b>agents,</b> except rituximab. There {{does not appear to be}} an increase in vaccination-related harms in vaccinated patients with AIIRD in comparison with unvaccinated patients with AIIRD. However, these studies are underpowered and therefore not conclusive. Conclusion: Based on the current evidence from the literature, recommendations for vaccination in patients with AIIRD were made. However, more research is needed in particular regarding incidence of VPI, harms of vaccination and the influence of (new <b>and</b> established) <b>immunomodulating</b> <b>agents</b> on vaccination efficacy.

40|$|Children {{with complex}} chronic {{conditions}} (CCC) are {{presumed to be}} vulnerable to adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The clinical profiles of ADRs in CCC are not well known. Herein, we aim to describe the ADR profiles in CCC with regard to typical presentations and vulnerable groups. We accessed the ADR yearly reports at a tertiary children's hospital whose practice is mainly dedicated to CCC and descriptively analyzed their clinical profiles {{according to the presence}} of a complex chronic condition, ADR severity, and age groups. A total of 1841 cases were analyzed, among which 1258 (68. 3 %) were mild, 493 (26. 8 %) moderate, and 90 (4. 9 %) cases were severe. A total of 1581 (85. 9 %) cases of complex chronic condition were reported. The proportion of CCC in each severity group increased as the ADR becomes more severe. In CCC, ADRs were most frequently reported by nurses in the adolescent group and in cases where the symptoms involved the gastrointestinal system. The class of <b>antineoplastic</b> <b>and</b> <b>immunomodulating</b> drugs was the most commonly suspected of causing an ADR, followed by one of the antibiotics. When we focus on the trend across the age groups, the ratio of severe-to-total ADRs decreased with older age. Among severe cases, the ratio of off-label prescription-related cases was the highest in the infant/toddler group and decreased as the groups aged. In conclusion, ADRs of CCCs admitted to a tertiary children's hospital have a unique profile. These groups are vulnerable to ADRs and thus they should be monitored closely, especially when they are infants or toddlers, so that severe ADRs can be identified and treated immediately...|$|R

40|$|Purpose To characterise the {{therapeutic}} profile of orphan medicines. Materials and Methods A cross-sectional study was performed during 2 {{months in a}} convenience sample of seven hospital pharmacy services, in the region of Lisbon. Data were collected, from pharmaceutical service's records. Results A total of 18 orphan medicines, were dispensed to 355 patients with rare diseases. Most patients were adults (76. 4 %). Premature and neonates accounted with 50. 0 % of the paediatric patients. Differences were not found between the proportion of male and female patients across age groups (p = 0. 762). Only 18. 3 % were inpatients. A high proportion of paediatric inpatients (58. 3 %) were seen in relation to adult inpatients (5. 9 %) (P = 0. 001). In general, anti-neoplastic <b>and</b> <b>immunomodulating</b> <b>agents</b> for rare cancers were the most frequent dispensed medicines (51. 3 %). In relation to paediatrics, Caffeine Citrate for primary apnoea of premature newborns had the higher frequency distribution (57. 1 %). Five (71. 4 %) medicines dispensed for paediatrics, do not have market authorisation and the remaining (28. 6 %) were used off-label. For pulmonary arterial hypertension 19 of 27 patients (70. 3 %) were treated with Bosentan. According to evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, Bosentan has a good level of evidence and substantial benefit: grade of recommendation A. Conclusions Most orphan medicines dispensed to paediatrics and adults were not licensed. A special pharmacovigilance program and a risk management plan through the entire life cycle should be implemented, towards effectiveness and safety of orphan medicines.

40|$|AIM—Orbital {{inflammation}} is common, but {{the mechanisms}} underlying leucocytic infiltration of orbital tissue are poorly understood. Human orbital fibroblasts (OF) express chemokines, interleukin 8  (IL- 8) and monocyte chemotactic protein 1  (MCP- 1), {{when exposed to}} proinflammatory cytokines. The effects of dexamethasone (DEX) and cyclosporin A (CSA) on OF IL- 8 and MCP- 1 were examined.  METHODS—Cultured human OF were incubated with recombinant interleukin 1 β (rIL- 1 β; 0. 2,  2. 0,  20  ng/ml) alone or incubated with rIL- 1 β and DEX (10 - 8, 10 - 7, 10 - 6 M) or CSA (3,  30,  300  ng/ml) for 24  hours. ELISA and northern blot analyses were performed to determine OF IL- 8 and MCP- 1 protein secretion and mRNA expression, respectively.  RESULTS—OF lacked constitutive IL- 8 or MCP- 1 expression, but secreted significant amounts of these chemokines and expressed substantial steady state mRNA for both chemokines upon rIL- 1 β stimulation. DEX caused dose dependent inhibition of IL- 1 induced IL- 8 (p< 0. 001) and MCP- 1 (p< 0. 05) secretion and mRNA expression at all concentrations of rIL- 1 β. CSA enhanced IL- 1 induced OF IL- 8 (p< 0. 001) and suppressed rIL- 1 β induced OF MCP- 1 (p< 0. 05) secretion when lower doses of rIL- 1 β were used. These effects on secreted chemokines at different concentrations of rIL- 1 β <b>and</b> <b>immunomodulating</b> <b>agents</b> were corroborated by steady state OF IL- 8 and MCP- 1 mRNA expression.  CONCLUSIONS—DEX is a potent inhibitor of OF IL- 8 and MCP- 1. In contrast, CSA enhances IL- 1 induced OF IL- 8 and suppresses OF MCP- 1. These observations may explain the relative lack of CSA effectiveness in human orbital diseases that respond to corticosteroids.    Keywords: orbital fibroblasts; chemokines; dexamethasone; cyclosporin...|$|R
40|$|Sepsis and {{septic shock}} {{are among the}} leading causes of death in {{intensive}} care units worldwide. Numerous studies on their pathophysiology have revealed an imbalance in the inflammatory network leading to tissue damage, organ failure, and ultimately, death. Cytokines are important pleiotropic regulators of the immune response, which have {{a crucial role in}} the complex pathophysiology underlying sepsis. They have both pro- and anti-inflammatory functions and are capable of coordinating effective defense mechanisms against invading pathogens. On the other hand, cytokines may dysregulate the immune response and promote tissue-damaging inflammation. In this review, we address the current knowledge of the actions of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in sepsis pathophysiology as well as how these cytokines <b>and</b> other important <b>immunomodulating</b> <b>agents</b> may be therapeutically targeted to improve the clinical outcome of sepsis...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{remarkable}} efficacy of biological therapy {{has resulted in}} significant success in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) management, susceptibility to infections remains a concern. The biological agents include the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors, for instance infliximab, <b>and</b> other <b>immunomodulating</b> <b>agents,</b> such as natalizumab. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare but mostly fatal opportunistic brain infection caused by reactivation of the human polyomavirus JC virus (JCV), {{has been found in}} two patients with multiple sclerosis and one patient with Crohn's disease (CD), linked to treatment with natalizumab. After these cases of PML, the commercial and investigational use of natalizumab was suspended in February 2005 but was subsequently resumed for multiple sclerosis and for CD, only through a special restricted distribution program. This review, starting from an extensive literature search by the PubMed database, resumes the clinical aspects and pathophysiology of CD and focuses on the biologics in current use in CD (infliximab, adalimumab, and natalizumab), in order to provide a reference and gateway to prevention, recognition, and management of JCV, {{in the early years of}} biological agents therapy. It also proposed to provide an overview on the hypothetical mechanism of reactivation of JC virus related to the use of these drugs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{review article}} {{considers}} different variants of measles vaccine {{that may be}} classified into two groups, i. e., vaccines that do not contain viable measles virus, and attenuated measles vaccines which could be employed in unusual manner. The first group includes DNA-vaccines, recombinant vaccine strains encoding synthesis of measles hemagglutinin and fusion protein, as well as peptide vaccines containing molecular fragments of these proteins. The mentioned variants of vaccines were effective in animal experiments, {{but they have not}} been tested in humans. The second group includes live attenuated mucosal measles vaccins applied in combination with immunomodulator(s), as aerosol and intranasally. Efficiency of these vaccines was tested and confirmed by immunization of children and adults. Mucosal measles vaccine induces local production of IgA measles antibodies, along with induced synthesis of circulating IgM and IgG antibodies against measles. The latter experimental variant could be a live attenuated measles vaccine containing some immunity-modulating agent. Elaboration of these variant was based on the known data about transient immunosuppressive activity of measles vaccine. An appropriate experimental variant represents a mixture of attenuated measles vaccine <b>and</b> synthetic <b>immunomodulating</b> <b>agent</b> (MP- 2 peptide) which protects T-lymphocytes from inhibitory effect of the measles virus. In present revue, some data are presented concerning the mechanisms of immunogenic activity and adverse effects of measles vaccines...|$|R
40|$|Toxic {{epidermal}} necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS) are severe adverse cutaneous drug {{reactions that}} predominantly involve {{the skin and}} mucous membranes. They are characterized by mucocutaneous tenderness and typically hemorrhagic erosions, erythema and more or less severe epidermal detachment presenting as blisters and areas of denuded skin. Drugs are assumed or identified as {{the main cause of}} SJS/TEN in most cases, but Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Herpes simplex virus infections are well documented causes alongside rare cases in which the etiology remains unknown. Several drugs are at "high" risk of inducing TEN/SJS including: Allopurinol, Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and other sulfonamide-antibiotics, aminopenicillins, cephalosporins, quinolones, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital and NSAID's of the oxicam-type. Differential diagnosis includes linear IgA dermatosis and paraneoplastic pemphigus, pemphigus vulgaris and bullous pemphigoid, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), disseminated fixed bullous drug eruption and staphyloccocal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS). Due to the high risk of mortality, management of patients with SJS/TEN requires rapid diagnosis, identification and interruption of the culprit drug, specialized supportive care ideally in an intensive care unit, <b>and</b> consideration of <b>immunomodulating</b> <b>agents</b> such as high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. </p...|$|R
40|$|Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is {{responsible}} for a primary infection (varicella) followed by a latency, eventually resulting in herpes zoster (shingles). The replication cycle of VZV is normally interrupted after varicella. Consequently, VZV remains dormant in the organism. Reactivation occurs after viraemia, {{and the development of}} tissue alterations (skin and viscera) depends on the immunological status of the patient. Diagnosis of herpes zoster relies on clinical recognition and cytological and histological evaluations combined with immunohistochemistry and molecular biology techniques. Treatment of herpes zoster primarily relies upon antiviral drugs <b>and</b> incidentally on <b>immunomodulating</b> <b>agents,</b> specific immunoglobulins, antimicrobial agents, antiviral enzymes and corticosteroids. Drugs with a clinically relevant activity against varicella zoster virus infections include aciclovir, adenosine monophosphate, bromodeoxyuridine, desciclovir, fiacitabine, idoxuridine, interferon-alpha and vidarabine. Among them, aciclovir appears to be a first-line agent. Its efficacy has been well established by many clinical studies. Promising drugs for the future include famciclovir, penciclovir, valaciclovir and other molecules currently under investigation. Recent and promising improvements in antiviral drug development may increase patient compliance, cost-benefit ratios and therapeutic efficacy. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of data from an active pharmacovigilance project at 32 EDs in the Lombardy region collected between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2011. Demographic, clinical, and pharmacological data on patients admitted to EDs were collected by trained and qualified monitors, and deterministic record linkage was performed to estimate hospitalizations. Pharmacoeconomic analyses were based on Diagnosis-Related Group reimbursement. Results: 8, 862 ADRs collected with an overall prevalence rate of 3. 5 per 1, 000 visits. Of all ADRs, 42 % were probably/definitely preventable and 46. 4 % were serious, 15 % required hospitalization, and 1. 5 % resulted in death. The System Organ Classes most frequently associated with ADRs were: skin and subcutaneous tissue, gastrointestinal, respiratory thoracic and mediastinal, and nervous system disorders. The most common Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classes involved in admissions were J (anti-infectives <b>and</b> <b>immunomodulating</b> <b>agents),</b> B (blood <b>and</b> blood-forming organs), and N (nervous system). Older age, yellow and red triage, higher number of concomitantly taken drugs, and previous attendance in ED for the same ADR were significantly associated with an increased risk of hospitalization. The total cost associated with ADR management was € 5, 184, 270, with a mean cost per patient of € 585. Fifty-eight percent of the economic burden was defined as probably/definitely preventable. Conclusion: ADRs are a serious health/economic issue in EDs. This assessment provides a thorough estimation of their seriousness, preventability, and burden impact in a large population from a representative European region.
