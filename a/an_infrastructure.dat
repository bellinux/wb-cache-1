40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} {{application}} level fairness issues in IEEE 802. 11 Wireless LANs. The current implementations of 802. 11 use {{the so called}} Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) that gives the same medium access priority to all the stations: realizing fairness at the MAC level. Nevertheless, fairness at MAC level may not correspond to fairness at application level, especially in presence of TCP controlled applications operating in <b>an</b> <b>infrastructured</b> network topology, such as an hot-spot. The goal {{of this paper is}} twofold: firstly, we investigate the fairness issues experienced by TCP based applications in <b>an</b> <b>infrastructured</b> WLAN; then we propose a rate-control mechanism, which seems appealing for its implementation practicability. ...|$|R
