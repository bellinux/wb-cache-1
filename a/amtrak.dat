5|$|<b>Amtrak</b> {{announced}} in October 1976 that the North Coast Hiawatha {{would be the}} second train, after the Empire Builder, to receive the new bi-level Superliner coaches, then on order from Pullman Standard. In the end the train was cancelled before the Superliners entered long-distance service. In the spring of 1977 <b>Amtrak</b> added seven hours to the schedule, increasing it to 52 hours 30 minutes. The change was prompted by new speed restrictions on <b>Amtrak</b> trains after a rash of derailments involving the new EMD SDP40F diesel locomotives. In September <b>Amtrak</b> eliminated the off-day ChicagoSt. Paul service, leaving the North Coast Hiawatha with three trips a week. <b>Amtrak</b> reduced the Empire Builder to quad-weekly service as well. The Twin Cities Hiawatha returned as a daytime service between Chicago and Minneapolis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Amtrak</b> assumed {{control of}} almost all private sector {{intercity}} passenger rail service in the United States on May 1, 1971, with a mandate to reverse decades of decline. <b>Amtrak</b> retained approximately 184 of the 440 trains which had run the day before. To operate these trains, <b>Amtrak</b> inherited a fleet of 300 locomotives (electric and diesel) and 1190 passenger cars, most of which dated from the 1940s–1950s.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{in order}} to add four {{additional}} <b>Amtrak</b> trips along the corridor, four of the then six round trips to New London were cut back to Old Saybrook. An agreement with the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection limits service over the Old Saybrook-Old Lyme bridge {{in order to}} avoid inconveniencing recreational boaters. ConnDOT's agreement with <b>Amtrak</b> allowed commuters with monthly passes to ride certain <b>Amtrak</b> trains instead. After criticism over the service cuts, in April 2008 ConnDOT began allowing commuters with multi-ride passes to board the selected <b>Amtrak</b> trains as well.|$|E

5|$|In 2008 Congress {{directed}} <b>Amtrak</b> {{to study}} resumption of service, which rekindled hope of restoration. <b>Amtrak</b> published a feasibility study in October 2009, which proposed restoring the North Coast Hiawatha to its 1979 route where possible with a daily schedule. <b>Amtrak</b> projected a yearly ridership of 359,800, {{some of whom}} would {{be drawn from the}} Empire Builder. <b>Amtrak</b> estimated that $1 billion in funds would be necessary to relaunch the service, including over $300 million for new locomotives and rolling stock. The corporation estimated it would take four to five years to reintroduce the service if a decision was made to move forward.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1977 <b>Amtrak</b> faced a power crisis. In {{addition}} to the SDP40Fs derailing, <b>Amtrak</b> was having trouble with two other six-axle designs. The GE E60CP and E60CH electric locomotives were having derailment problems as well; the GE P30CH had the same truck design as E60s and rode poorly, although it did not exhibit the same tendency to derail. <b>Amtrak</b> decided to abandon the SDP40F {{in favor of the}} F40PH, a four-axle design with none of the riding problems of the six-axle locomotives. <b>Amtrak</b> traded 40 SDP40Fs back to EMD; components including the prime mover were installed into an F40PH's frame. Between 1977–1987 <b>Amtrak</b> would trade 132 of the SDP40Fs back to EMD for F40PHRs. The SDP40F remained in service on the Santa Fe longer than anywhere else, although the arrival of HEP-equipped Superliner cars on the Western routes displaced them from there as well. The last SDP40Fs left the <b>Amtrak</b> roster in 1987.|$|E
5|$|On February 6, 1977, <b>Amtrak</b> {{announced}} plans to spend $24.4 million to overhaul all 61 cars {{as part of a}} larger fleet renewal program. In early 1977, some cars were repainted in Amtrak's Phase I paint scheme with red, white and blue ends and a small <b>Amtrak</b> logo. On September 28, the <b>Amtrak</b> board approved a more limited overhaul program of 16 Metroliners, as well as the purchase of the first 8 AEM-7 electric locomotives. On November 7, <b>Amtrak</b> released a specification for overhauling the 57 unmodified cars. It awarded a $20 million overhaul contract to GE that month.|$|E

5|$|On November 7, 1998, <b>Amtrak</b> {{extended}} the Pennsylvanian through to Chicago {{along the route}} of the Capitol Limited via Toledo, finally bringing a daylight connection to Cleveland. The Three Rivers continued to run over a different schedule via Akron and Fostoria. As part of the change <b>Amtrak</b> truncated the eastern end to Philadelphia, enabling the train to complete the run within a single day. The change was driven by Amtrak's growing mail and express business; Pittsburgh–Philadelphia ridership suffered. <b>Amtrak</b> returned the Pennsylvanian to the New YorkPittsburgh route on January 27, 2003, citing low ridership and Amtrak's withdrawal from the express freight business. On November 1, 2004, <b>Amtrak</b> merged the Pennsylvanian and Three Rivers, keeping the latter name with a western terminus in Chicago. <b>Amtrak</b> had sought $2.5million in assistance from Pennsylvania to keep both trains running. On March 8, 2005, <b>Amtrak</b> truncated service to PittsburghNew York and restored the Pennsylvanian name to the route.|$|E
5|$|After {{significant}} ridership {{gains in}} 1984, PennDOT proposed {{that a second}} train {{be added to the}} route. PennDOT and <b>Amtrak</b> would have split the costs evenly. <b>Amtrak</b> officials were favorable, but budget problems stalled the plan.|$|E

25|$|Today, <b>Amtrak's</b> Auto Train carries about 200,000 {{passengers}} and generates around $50million in revenue annually. It is considered <b>Amtrak's</b> best-paying train {{in terms of}} income in comparison with operating expenses.|$|R
5|$|<b>Amtrak</b> {{discontinued}} the Broadway Limited on September 10, 1995, in {{the face}} of significant funding problems. The Broadway Limited then earned $6.6 million against costs of $24 million. <b>Amtrak</b> replaced it with the all-coach Three Rivers, which would in turn be discontinued in 2005.|$|E
5|$|<b>Amtrak</b> {{inherited}} {{an aging}} and mechanically-incompatible fleet of diesel locomotives from various private railroads on its startup in 1971. The most modern locomotives remained {{in private hands}} to operate the various commuter services which, by law, did not pass to <b>Amtrak.</b> To replace these <b>Amtrak</b> ordered 150 EMD SDP40F locomotives, which began entering service in 1973. These were supplemented by 25 GE P30CHs which entered service in 1975. The SDP40F was a troubled design; problems with weight distribution led {{to a series of}} derailments in the mid-1970s. Meanwhile, the poor truck design of the P30CH (and the electric GE E60CP) curtailed further orders of that unit when <b>Amtrak</b> found itself needing more short- and medium-distance power in the spring of 1975.|$|E
5|$|<b>Amtrak</b> ordered 26 E60s in 1973; 15 on March 26, 1973, and {{a further}} 11 on October 12. The {{total cost of}} the order was $18.4 million. The initial order was for 15 {{locomotives}} with steam generators and 11 with head-end power, but 9 of the first type were switched to using head-end power as <b>Amtrak</b> ramped up acquisition of Amfleet cars. <b>Amtrak</b> anticipated that E60-hauled Amfleet trains could displace both the GG1s and the mechanically-unreliable Metroliners.|$|E

5|$|<b>Amtrak</b> retired its {{fleet of}} F40PHs {{in the mid-1990s}} {{in favor of the}} GE Genesis, but the {{locomotive}} remains the mainstay of Via Rail's long-distance trains and is a common sight on many other commuter railroads throughout the United States. In addition, <b>Amtrak</b> has kept a number of de-engined F40PHs in use as Cabbage cars/Non-Powered Control Units.|$|E
5|$|<b>Amtrak</b> {{singled out}} the Broadway Limited for special {{treatment}} and in 1972 completely refurbished its equipment, {{most of which}} was ex-Penn Central, although former Union Pacific Railroad sleeping cars were also used. <b>Amtrak</b> also added a Slumbercoach to the consist. In 1974 <b>Amtrak</b> tried out rebuilt 6-bedroom, 8-roomette ex-Rock Island sleeping cars, but their limited capacity reduced revenue. The Broadway Limited began receiving rebuilt Heritage Fleet cars in 1980, and Amfleet coaches thereafter. 68 cars were rebuilt at a total cost of $9.8 million.|$|E
5|$|<b>Amtrak</b> {{took over}} {{operation}} of most intercity rail passenger {{service in the}} United States on May 1, 1971; up until then such services were run by various private railroads. The private railroads chose to retain their most modern passenger locomotives to operate the various commuter services which, by law, did not pass to <b>Amtrak.</b> To operate these intercity services the company had to buy or lease from the private railroads whatever locomotives remained. This left <b>Amtrak</b> with an aging and mechanically-incompatible fleet of diesel locomotives. The mainstays of Amtrak's road diesel fleet were veteran EMD E8s and EMD E9s, which were all 10–20 years old and due for replacement.|$|E

5|$|<b>Amtrak,</b> the {{national}} passenger rail system, provides service to Denver, operating its California Zephyr daily {{in both directions}} between Chicago and Emeryville, California, across the bay from San Francisco. <b>Amtrak</b> Thruway service operated by private bus companies links the Denver station with Rocky Mountain points. In 2017 a bill was introduced into the state legislature to connect towns and cities along the Front Range with an additional <b>Amtrak</b> line or state-funded alternative.|$|E
5|$|As {{problems}} with the EMD SDP40F mounted, <b>Amtrak</b> adopted the F40PH as its long-term solution nationwide for diesel service. In the spring of 1977 <b>Amtrak</b> traded 40 SDP40Fs back to EMD; components including the prime mover were installed into an F40PH's frame. The 40 rebuilt locomotives were designated F40PHR and were identical to new-build F40PHs, incorporating the larger fuel tank and more powerful HEP generator which had become standard. <b>Amtrak</b> ultimately acquired 132 F40PHRs in this manner, which combined with new orders between 1975–1988, and the purchase of six GMD F40PHs from GO Transit in 1990, led to a fleet of 216 locomotives, the country's largest fleet.|$|E
5|$|Elizabethtown is an <b>Amtrak</b> {{railroad}} {{station on the}} Keystone Corridor in Elizabethtown, Lancaster County in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. The station is served by Amtrak's Keystone Service between New York City and Harrisburg, and by the Pennsylvanian between New York and Pittsburgh. The station was built in 1915 by the Pennsylvania Railroad to replace another that had been built in 1900. The station building was closed in 1977 by <b>Amtrak.</b> The title to the building {{was transferred to the}} borough of Elizabethtown in 1998, and it was leased back to <b>Amtrak.</b> From 2009 to 2011, the station underwent a 21-month renovation to make it handicapped-accessible.|$|E
