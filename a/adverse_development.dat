Other anatomical factors that may have significance include os acromiale and acromial spurs. Environmental factors implicated include increasing age, shoulder overuse, smoking, and any medical condition that affects circulation or impairs the inflammatory and healing response, such as diabetes mellitus.|$|E

According to food columnist Ari LeVaux, Seneff's {{work in this area}} has made her [...] "a controversial figure in the scientific community" [...] and she has received [...] "heated objections from experts in most every field she’s delved into". In 2013, she coauthored a paper that associated the herbicide glyphosate {{with a wide variety of}} diseases such as cancer and disorders such as autism. Discover magazine writer Keith Kloor criticized the uncritical republication of the study's results by other media outlets. Jerry Steiner, the executive vice president of sustainability at Monsanto, said in an interview regarding the study that [...] "We are very confident in the long track record that glyphosate has. It has been very, very extensively studied." [...] Seneff's claim that glyphosate is a major cause of autism and that, [...] "At today’s rates, by 2025, half the kids born will be diagnosed with autism," [...] has also been criticized. For example, the Pacific Standard noted that, contrary to Seneff's claims, many scientific reviews have found that the rise in autism rates over the past 20 years is due to changes in diagnostic practices, and that a number of studies, including a 2012 review in the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, have found little evidence that glyphosate is associated with <b>adverse</b> <b>development</b> outcomes.|$|E
