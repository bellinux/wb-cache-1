5|$|Sonderbehandlung is a German noun meaning special {{treatment}} in English. While it {{can refer to}} any sort of preferential treatment, it is known primarily as <b>a</b> <b>euphemism</b> for mass murder used by Nazi functionaries and the SS, who commonly used the abbreviation S.B. in documentation. It first came to prominence during Action T4, where SS doctors killed mentally ill and disabled patients between 1939 and 1941, {{and was one of}} a number of nonspecific words the Nazis used to document mass murder and genocide. Another notable example was Sonderbehandlung 14f13.|$|E
5|$|With the SA {{out of the}} way, Heydrich began {{building}} the Gestapo into an instrument of fear. He improved his index-card system, creating categories of offenders with colour-coded cards. The Gestapo {{had the authority to}} arrest citizens on the suspicion that they might commit a crime, and the definition of a crime was at their discretion. The Gestapo Law, passed in 1936, gave police the right to act extra-legally. This led to the sweeping use of Schutzhaft—"protective custody", <b>a</b> <b>euphemism</b> for the power to imprison people without judicial proceedings. The courts were not allowed to investigate or interfere. The Gestapo was considered to be acting legally {{as long as it was}} carrying out the leadership's will. People were arrested arbitrarily, sent to concentration camps, or killed.|$|E
5|$|But Beyoncé is {{far from}} being all sentiment. Because a large part of being Beyoncé in America in 2013 is being a sexual {{creature}} and not only being unafraid of that fact, but reveling— and reveling confidently— in it. The amorphous, shifting Houston-trap-meets-Noah Shebib trunk rattler 'Partition' exemplifies this particular sentiment. On the track, the Queen Bey tells her driver to put the partition up because 'I don’t need you seeing 'Yoncé on her knees'; uses Monica Lewinsky as <b>a</b> <b>euphemism</b> for her man finishing on her clothing; reveals that 'he like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty'; and repeats that it took her '45 minutes to get all dressed up / and we ain’t even gonna make it to this club'. And in maybe the wildest moment in an album full of bold moves, Beyoncé actually slips in the French translation of Julianne Moore's 'Feminists love sex' monologue from The Big Lebowski.|$|E

50|$|Kurai Onrum Illai {{is one of}} the few songs {{written by}} Indian politician, freedom-fighter and Governor-General of India, Chakravarti Rajagopalachari. According to Gopalkrishna Gandhi the song is <b>an</b> <b>euphemism</b> for the bhakti of untouchables (also known as Adi Dravidars or Harijans or Panchama).|$|R
5000|$|Doodh peeti was {{a method}} of female {{infanticide}} in which newborns were drowned in pails or pits of cow milk (doodh). The practice was prevalent in the Saurashtra and Kutch region of India. The phrase is <b>an</b> <b>euphemism</b> literal meaning [...] "feeding of milk".|$|R
5|$|Geheime Staatspolizei ("Secret State Police"; Gestapo) was {{the secret}} police force of Nazi Germany and German-occupied Europe. Formed in April 1933 by the {{aviation}} minister Hermann Göring, it was by the following year administrated by the SS and regarded as a sister organization of the SD. The Gestapo relied on members of other agencies, spies and a huge network of informants for information. It was led by Heydrich and Heinrich Müller. Whether trained as police originally or not, Gestapo agents themselves were shaped by their socio-political environment. Historian George C. Browder contends {{that there was a}} four-part process (authorization, bolstering, routinization, and dehumanization) in effect which legitimized the psycho-social atmosphere conditioning members of the Gestapo to radicalized violence. The power of the Gestapo included what was called, Schutzhaft ("protective custody"), <b>a</b> <b>euphemism</b> for the power to arrest and imprison people without judicial proceedings.|$|E
5|$|The wet, or rainy, {{season is}} the time of year, {{covering}} one or more months, when most of the average annual rainfall in a region falls. The term green season is also sometimes used as <b>a</b> <b>euphemism</b> by tourist authorities. Areas with wet seasons are dispersed across portions of the tropics and subtropics. Savanna climates and areas with monsoon regimes have wet summers and dry winters. Tropical rainforests technically do not have dry or wet seasons, since their rainfall is equally distributed through the year. Some areas with pronounced rainy seasons will see a break in rainfall mid-season when the intertropical convergence zone or monsoon trough move poleward of their location {{during the middle of the}} warm season. When the wet season occurs during the warm season, or summer, rain falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours. The wet season is a time when air quality improves, freshwater quality improves, and vegetation grows significantly.|$|E

5000|$|During World War II, Japanese {{soldiers}} {{engaged in}} forced prostitution during their invasions across East Asia and Southeast Asia. The term [...] "comfort women" [...] became <b>an</b> <b>euphemism</b> for the estimated 200,000 mostly Korean and Chinese {{women who were}} forced into prostitution in Japanese military brothels during the war.|$|R

5000|$|In the 2007 book China Road, author Rob Gifford {{stated that}} the Chinese refer to Anhui as a [...] "big {{agricultural}} province" [...] (农业大省). According to Gifford, this is <b>an</b> <b>euphemism</b> for <b>a</b> [...] "very poor" [...] area and that people have referred to Anhui as the [...] "Appalachia of China".|$|R
25|$|Terminological inexactitude is {{a phrase}} {{introduced}} in 1906 by British politician (later Prime Minister) Winston Churchill. Today, {{it is used}} as <b>a</b> <b>euphemism</b> or circumlocution meaning a lie or untruth.|$|E
25|$|In {{the city}} of Poltava all the {{remaining}} clergy were arrested during the night of 26–27 February 1938. Their relatives were told {{that all of them}} were sentences to ten years without the right to correspond, which was <b>a</b> <b>euphemism</b> for the death sentence.|$|E
25|$|Those {{who favor}} the non-sexual {{interpretation}} argue against a denotation {{of sexual behavior}} in this context, noting that while the Hebrew word for know appears over 900 times in the Hebrew Scriptures, only approximately 1% (13–14 times) of those references is it clearly used as <b>a</b> <b>euphemism</b> for realizing sexual intimacy. Instead, those who hold to this interpretation usually see the demand to know as demanding the right to interrogate the strangers.|$|E
5000|$|The Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary and Webster's Dictionary both define [...] "{{son of a}} gun" [...] in American English as <b>an</b> <b>euphemism</b> for son of a bitch. Encarta Dictionary {{defines the}} term in a {{different}} way as someone [...] "affectionately or kindly regarded." [...] The term can also be used as an interjection expressing surprise, mild annoyance or disappointment.|$|R
5000|$|Some use {{initials}} {{as a form}} {{of pride}} and an option to recognize/credit their father. Some rare people use mother name's initial, when their father is cruel or deserted—just to credit their mother's role in bringing them up. In some parts of Tamil Nadu, the term [...] "person without initial" [...] is often used as <b>an</b> <b>euphemism</b> for bastard.|$|R

25|$|To avoid {{confusion}} with the Alevis, the Alawites call themselves Arap Alevileri ("Arab Alevis") in Turkish. The term Nusayrī, previously used in theological texts, has been revived in recent studies. In Çukurova, Alawites {{are known as}} Fellah and Arabuşağı (although the latter is considered offensive) by the Sunni population. A quasi-official name used during the 1930s by Turkish authorities was Eti Türkleri ("Hittite Turks"), to conceal their Arabic origins. Although this term is obsolete, it is still used by some older people as <b>a</b> <b>euphemism.</b>|$|E
25|$|The salsa {{controversy}} is also {{closely tied to}} the decades-long estrangement between the governments of the United States and Cuba, and the United States embargo against Cuba. Radio stations in the United States would get bomb threats (presumably from Cuban exiles) for playing Cuban records over the air. Homegrown salsa on the other hand, was embraced. For a time the Cuban state media officially claimed that the term salsa music was <b>a</b> <b>euphemism</b> for authentic Cuban music stolen by American imperialists, though the media has since abandoned this theory.|$|E
25|$|It was the Spaniards {{who gave}} the world the notion that an aristocrat's blood is not red but blue. The Spanish nobility started taking shape around the ninth century in classic {{military}} fashion, occupying land as warriors on horseback. They were to continue the process {{for more than five}} hundred years, clawing back sections of the peninsula from its Moorish occupiers, and a nobleman demonstrated his pedigree by holding up his sword arm to display the filigree of blue-blooded veins beneath his pale skin—proof that his birth had not been contaminated by the dark-skinned enemy. Sangre azul, blue blood, was thus <b>a</b> <b>euphemism</b> for being a white man—Spain's own particular reminder that the refined footsteps of the aristocracy through history carry the rather less refined spoor of racism.|$|E

25|$|In {{classical}} Athens, it {{was used}} as an abbreviation for the Greek θάνατος (thanatos, “death”) and as it vaguely resembles a human skull, theta was used as a warning symbol of death, {{in the same way that}} skull and crossbones are used in modern times. It survives on potsherds used by Athenians when voting for the death penalty. Petrus de Dacia in a document from 1291 relates the idea that theta was used to brand criminals as empty ciphers, and the branding rod was affixed to the crossbar spanning the circle. For this reason, use of the number theta was sometimes avoided where the connotation was felt to be unlucky—the mint marks of some Late Imperial Roman coins famously have the sum ΔΕ or ΕΔ (delta and epsilon, that is 4 and 5) substituted as <b>a</b> <b>euphemism</b> where a Θ (9) would otherwise be expected.|$|E

500|$|... "Teso Dos Bichos" [...] {{was taken}} by John Shiban, the episode's writer, from an ancient chant. The words {{translate}} into archaic Portuguese as [...] "Burial Mound of Small Animals," [...] although other translations have been proposed. In Colombia and Venezuela, the word [...] "bichos" [...] is <b>a</b> <b>euphemism</b> for testicles, something Shiban was unaware of when writing the script. Shiban later joked that this [...] "controversy" [...] {{would be good for}} ratings.|$|E
500|$|The RSDLP, the {{predecessor}} to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, {{was formed in}} 1898. The goal of the RSDLP was to change {{the economic and political}} system in the Russian Empire through a proletarian revolution in accordance with Marxist doctrine. Alongside their political activities, the RSDLP and other revolutionary groups (such as anarchists and Socialist Revolutionaries) practised a range of militant operations, including [...] "expropriations", <b>a</b> <b>euphemism</b> for armed robberies of government or private funds to support revolutionary activities.|$|E
500|$|Prostitutes in Athens {{were either}} [...] "pornai" [...] or hetairai ("companions", <b>a</b> <b>euphemism</b> for higher-class prostitution). Although many were slaves or metics (and state-run brothels staffed by slaves {{were said to}} have been part of Solon's reforms), Athenian-born women also worked in the sex trade in Athens. Pornai {{apparently}} charged one to six obols for each sexual act; hetairai were more likely to receive gifts and favours from their clients, enabling to them to maintain a fiction that they were not being paid for sex.|$|E
5000|$|Eve-teasing is <b>an</b> <b>euphemism</b> used {{throughout}} South Asia, {{in countries such}} as Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, for public sexual harassment or molestation (often known as [...] "street harassment") of women by men, where Eve alludes to the very first woman, according to the Biblical creation story. Sexual harassment affects many women in Bangladesh, especially teenage girls, where the girls are intimidated in the streets, are shouted obscenities at, laughed at, or grabbed by their clothes.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{authorities}} {{have stated that}} the official name Estado Libre Asociado constitutes <b>an</b> <b>euphemism,</b> that is, <b>a</b> term intended to give positive appearances to negative events or even mislead entirely, and have charged that the official name in English of [...] "Commonwealth" [...] constitutes a fig leaf, i.e., a term used figuratively and associated with the covering up of an act that is actually embarrassing or distasteful with something of innocuous appearance.|$|R
5000|$|Like Grand Theft Auto, {{the game}} has a free-roam, sandbox-style structure, and allows the player to do {{whichever}} mission at his/her own leisure.
