30|$|Earnings {{functions}} are estimated for wage employees, for both sexes together and separately {{for men and}} women. Since participation in wage employment is not a random phenomenon, we first correct for potential sample selection bias by estimating an equation to determine who is a wage employee and then estimate an earnings function conditional on wage employment. Thus, we include in the earnings equation an additional regressor representing the selectivity variable (inverse of Mill’s ratio) constructed from the estimates of a multinomial logit model for <b>activity</b> <b>status.</b> The choice groups for <b>activity</b> <b>status</b> are wage employment, non-wage employment (comprising employers, self-employed persons, and unpaid family workers), unemployment, and non-participation in the labor force. In the estimation of earnings functions containing a selectivity term, the identification of this term requires having one or more variables that influence the choice of <b>activity</b> <b>status</b> but do not directly determine earnings. We achieve this identification by excluding household characteristics that appear in the model for <b>activity</b> <b>status</b> (viz., presence of small children, if head of household, number of other earners in the household, and total earnings of other household members) from the earnings equation. The results of the first stage exercise on the determinants of <b>activity</b> <b>status</b> are not <b>reported</b> in the paper, but {{are available from the}} author on request.|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} the OSPAR Commission {{includes}} monitoring input of pollutants from sea, land and atmospheric sources entering the North Sea and wider North-East Atlantic. The OSPAR Commission is responsible for implementing {{the requirements of the}} OSPAR Convention on the protection of the marine environment of the North-East Atlantic. As part of its activities, the Commission published the results of those monitoring <b>activities</b> in Quality <b>Status</b> <b>Reports</b> in 2000 and 2010. Those reports set out the state of the environment in the OSPAR maritime area as a whole and its regional areas such as the North Sea. Data on oil inputs from the offshore oil and gas industry and from shipping that enters the North Sea is generally available, but less so for the broader OSPAR maritime area. Data on the impact of oil inputs on the marine environment has much more limited availability. This chapter provides an overview of the development of the OSPAR Convention and Commission and examines the findings of the Quality <b>Status</b> <b>Reports,</b> both for the wider OSPAR maritime area and the North Sea more specifically...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Cardiac {{rehabilitation}} (CR) is {{most often}} provided in a hospital setting. Home-based models of care {{have been developed to}} overcome geographic, among other, barriers in patients at lower-risk. This study assessed whether clinical and geographic factors were related to use of either a hospital- or home-based program. Methods: Secondary analysis was undertaken within a study of 1268 cardiac outpatients recruited from 97 cardiologist practices where clinical data were extracted. Participants completed a survey including the Duke <b>Activity</b> <b>Status</b> Index. They <b>reported</b> CR utilization in a second survey mailed 9 months later, including CR site and program model. Geographic information systems was used to determine distances and drive times to the CR site attended from patients’ homes. Results: Overall, 469 (37. 0 %) participants attended CR at one of 41 programs. Of the 373 (79. 5 %) participants with complete geographic data, 43 (11. 5 %) reported attending home-based CR. The sole clinical difference was in <b>activity</b> <b>status,</b> where patients attending hospital-based program had lower <b>activity</b> <b>status</b> (p. 05). Conclusions: Only one-tenth of outpatients participated in a home-based program, and this allocation was unrelated geographic considerations. While patients should continue to be appropriately-triaged based on clinical risk to ensure safety, more targeted allocation of patients to home-based services may be warranted. This may optimize degree of participation, and potentially patient outcomes. Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) grant MOP- 7443...|$|R
40|$|The University of California, Davis, {{starling}} {{research program}} was broadened in 1976 to encompass agricultural pest birds in general. Under new direction {{there were a}} number of applied problems studied. The effects of feeding cattle only between 1600 hours and 0800 hours on cattle weight gain was studied with results indicating slower weight gains and lower meat quality when compared to cattle fed ad lib. Feed component selection by starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) was also studied finding that a starling selected diet contains a higher percentage of the high protein components than present in a commercially prepared dairy feed ration fed to them. References are given to papers on a damage assessment technique for grapes, a field test of methiocarb as an avian repellent to protect figs, and a field test using Avitrol treated seed to control house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus).

40|$|In {{the context}} of policy {{concerns}} regarding social exclusion, a range of agencies has collected information on, and delivered services for, "vulnerable" young people. Technological developments enhance possibilities of linking information from different sources to "map" and "track" young people as they move between agencies and their <b>activity</b> <b>status</b> changes. This <b>report</b> outlines some of the advantages and limitations of "mapping" and "tracking" methodologies. It identifies examples of good practice and difficulties which agencies have encountered in building reliable, accurate, up-to-date and robust systems. Particular {{attention is paid to}} issues relating to resources, partnership working, data protection and information technology. "Keeping track": traces the changing nature of youth transitions; explores the concepts of "mapping" and "tracking"; outlines the results of a survey of activities of careers service companies; presents pen portraits of a number of local tracking projects and discusses key issues emerging. This report is important reading for policy makers, practitioners and researchers concerned with social exclusion and the delivery of services to young people. It is of particular relevance to those working in careers services, local authorities, the voluntary sector and others engaging in partnership at local level...|$|R
