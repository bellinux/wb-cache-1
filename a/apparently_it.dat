5|$|The rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia, {{which the}} Sumatran rhino inhabits, are also targets for {{legal and illegal}} logging because of the {{desirability}} of their hardwoods. Rare woods such as merbau, meranti and semaram are valuable on the international markets, fetching as much as $1,800perm3 ($1,375percuyd). Enforcement of illegal-logging laws is difficult because humans live within or near {{many of the same}} forests as the rhino. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake has been used to justify new logging. Although the hardwoods in the rainforests of the Sumatran rhino are destined for international markets and not widely used in domestic construction, the number of logging permits for these woods has increased dramatically because of the tsunami. However, while this species has been suggested to be highly sensitive to habitat disturbance, <b>apparently</b> <b>it</b> is of little importance compared to hunting, as it can withstand more or less any forest condition.|$|E

25|$|By 1989, {{a second}} army Brigade was formed, the 223, {{equipped}} with 4 locally developed trailer launchers, {{known as the}} Al-Nida. There were also a second indigenous launcher, the Al-Waleed, but <b>apparently</b> <b>it</b> never became operational.|$|E
50|$|Pahñú o Pañhú is an archeological site in Tecozautla, State of Hidalgo. A {{settlement}} from Xajay Culture {{developed between}} 300 and 1100 years ago. <b>Apparently</b> <b>it's</b> {{the heir to}} the Preclassic period of Chupícuaro culture, in El Bajío, is related to origin of the Otomis of Mezquital Valley.|$|R
50|$|Amazon stone, or amazonite, is a green {{variety of}} microcline. It is not found {{anywhere}} in the Amazon Basin, however. The Spanish explorers who named <b>it</b> <b>apparently</b> confused <b>it</b> with another green mineral from that region.|$|R
50|$|Wife selling {{was criticized}} by the Roman Catholic Pope Gregory VII in the 11th century, and the Catholic church over time objected to <b>it,</b> <b>apparently</b> because <b>it</b> objected to divorce, while the non-Catholic Christian church {{sometimes}} did not oppose it.|$|R
25|$|The Seanchaí {{goes on to}} tell Somerville {{the story}} of the Serpent once inhabiting Lough Cluhir, when Ivor was still living. <b>Apparently</b> <b>it</b> caused {{considerable}} destruction and would jump out to grab anything or anyone who got within five feet of the water. One day, however...|$|E
25|$|Practice of the {{imperial}} cult was revived by Titus, though <b>apparently</b> <b>it</b> met with some difficulty as Vespasian was not deified until six months after his death. To further honor and glorify the Flavian dynasty, foundations were laid for what would later become the Temple of Vespasian and Titus, which was finished by Domitian.|$|E
25|$|Remarks: The {{shell is}} white with rather {{numerous}} brown flammulations that become confluent on the base, elongate, and quite slender. <b>Apparently</b> <b>it</b> {{is a white}} derivative from the interruptus stock, which may have a definite geographic separation in Bali and Java. Material from Kedewan, East Java (Butot, Chicago Natural History Museum 72404) ranged from 43.5 to 48mm in height.|$|E
50|$|Within {{these devices}} {{rotation}} is detected by a mechanical ring (US 5,936,612). This mechanism was {{promoted by the}} Canadian company Handview Inc; however <b>it</b> <b>apparently</b> never made <b>it</b> to production.|$|R

Good-bye, Mr. Carmyle, and thank you for giving me dinner." ...|$|R
25|$|Probably the non-preservation of {{the work}} was due to an excess of the foreign element in its composition, causing it to be {{regarded}} with disfavor. Moreover, as has recently been ascertained by A. Epstein, {{it was not a}} systematically arranged work, but merely a collection of notes made by Moses. For this reason, <b>apparently,</b> <b>it</b> did not have a fixed title, and therefore it is quoted under various names by different authors.|$|E
25|$|Within Anatolia, {{regional}} volcanism started middle-late Miocene. During {{the late}} Miocene–Pliocene period, widespread volcanism blanketed the entire East Anatolian–Iranian plateau under thick volcanic rocks. This volcanic activity has continued uninterrupted until historical times. <b>Apparently,</b> <b>it</b> reached a climax during the latest Miocene–Pliocene, 6 to 3 Ma. During the Quaternary, the volcanism became restricted {{to a few}} local volcanoes such as Mount Ararat. These volcanoes are typically associated with north–south tensional fractures formed by the continuing the north–south shortening deformation of Anatolia.|$|E
25|$|The state {{retained}} {{both its}} powers {{and its role}} in the rural economy in the 1980s. Decollectivization, like the collectivization of the 1950s, was directed from the top down. Sometimes, <b>apparently,</b> <b>it</b> was imposed on communities that had been content with their collective methods. But in permitting households and communities greater leeway to decide what to produce and in allowing the growth of rural markets and small-scale industries, the state stepped back from the close supervision and mandatory quotas of the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E

25|$|According to her survivors, {{the first}} torpedo struck just aft {{of the bridge}} and caused major damage. <b>Apparently,</b> <b>it</b> {{exploded}} the ship's magazine; the resulting blast sheared off everything forward of the point of impact, destroying completely the bridge, the chart room, and the officers' and petty officers' quarters. As she stopped dead in the water, unable to signal a distress message, a second torpedo struck about 40 feet forward of the fantail and carried away the after part of the ship above the keel plates and shafts and destroyed the after crew's quarters. Only the midships section was left intact.|$|E
25|$|Stairway. At about 30 metres {{west of the}} Votive Pyramid this {{stairway}} was discovered, {{was used}} as main access to the top levels of the site. It was constructed in two stages; the first, that approximately reached {{the middle of the}} height now observed, <b>apparently</b> <b>it</b> was round shape, and can be associated with shapes of now missing structures; the second, built over the former and with greater height, it reached the walkway on the second level, evidence shows ties with a two ramp stairway that ascended to the third level. At a point in time the main stairway was cancelled, by defence reasons by means of the retaining wall, limiting access.|$|E
25|$|In Tamil Nadu, Sheikh Abdul Ghaffoor, 39, {{was arrested}} with an alleged plan of {{carrying}} out bombings on Independence Day, 15 August 2008. The plot included bombing the state capital Chennai along with three other cities in Tamil Nadu and at least six trains. Meenakshi Amman Temple in Madurai {{is believed to be}} on top of the list for such terror attack. The man was detained with a large cache of explosives and two timer devices. <b>Apparently,</b> <b>it</b> is believed that the plot was revealed by an arrested leader, P Ali Abdullah, of a banned organisation, who has been serving sentences in an Indian jail since 2003. Chennai city police later on 1 August 2008 announced that the arrests were not linked with either the Ahmedabad or Bangalore blasts.|$|E

25|$|A trial trip to Mapperley {{was made}} on 1 May on car 57. <b>Apparently</b> <b>it</b> was a very hot day and {{the driver of the}} car said that much sand was needed to {{overcome}} the stickiness of the tar, which had melted and overflowed onto the rails from between the setts. The steepest gradient of the section was 1 in 11. Major Pringle, the Board of Trade inspector, duly inspected the approved route on 6 May and public service commenced a week later, on 13 May. This service operated via the Market Place to Trent Bridge every 12 minutes, alternating with a short working between Alexandra Park and Trent Bridge every 12 minutes. The fare between the Market Place and Mapperley was 2d., with intermediate 1d. stages. At first there was a stop on the outward journey at Cranmer Street, but this was discontinued early in 1903 because of the difficulty of restarting the cars, the hill being at its steepest at this point.|$|E
25|$|Kuchuk Tepe {{settlement}} in Bactria (today Uzbekistan) is {{also related to}} the Yaz I culture. It looked like a flattened circular hill with an area of 0.5 hectares and height 8 m. The structures were built on a clay platform surrounded by a defensive wall. At {{the end of the}} first period (10th to mid-8th centuries BCE) the building had twenty-five chambers; <b>apparently</b> <b>it</b> was a large fortified house, while towns start appearing in the region towards the end of that period. Other Bactrian well known sites with Yaz I ceramics are Tillya Tepe in northeastern Afghanistan, and Kyzyl Tepe, Dzharkutan, Kangurt-Tut, and Teguzak in Tajikistan. The single purely Yaz I site in Tajikistan is Karim-berdy which measures 500 x 300 m. Along the Kunduz River are located oasis Naibabad and Farukabad. The settlements at Bandykhan, between Shirabad and Denov in Uzbekistan, show Yaz I (14th-11th century BCE), Yaz II/A (10th-9th/8th century BCE), Yaz II/B (8th-7th/6th century BCE), and Yaz III (6th-4th century BCE).|$|E
25|$|Llorens {{returned}} to Spain {{in the late}} 1870s. In 1879 he married Concepción Colomer y Conca and settled in her native town of Onteniente, in the family residence at Carre Gomis in the city centre; the couple had 2 sons and 2 daughters. Active in Juventud Católica, published three volumes of his war recollections. In the mid-1880s he produced the first designs to re-direct the Turia river near Valencia and to re-build the local maritime infrastructure accordingly, to create a park along the river banks and to expand the local tram network. He taught at the Valencian Academia de Matemáticas, becoming a recognized scholar also in astronomy. Occasionally contributed to newspapers, himself founded a satirical review El Centro, practiced oil painting and used to win honors in local exhibits. Lloréns invented a handgun which bore his name; the patent was registered in 1897 and featured a repeating rifle with detachable magazine box, though <b>apparently</b> <b>it</b> has never entered production.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after this}} episode was aired, Gateworld {{announced}} that the Sci-Fi Channel had decided not renew Stargate SG-1 for the coming year. The Channel later confirmed this decision, {{at the same time}} announcing that Stargate Atlantis had been picked up for another season. Many fans denounced Gateworld's cancellation announcement, both the timing of it (<b>apparently</b> <b>it</b> had been made while the cast and crew were celebrating the episode's airing)—and the decision itself, on the ground that, while ratings were not as high as they had been in previous seasons, the series was still drawing an audience of a respectable size. (For example, it had a season average of 2million viewers in Australia, half of them in the 18–49 demographic.) Sci Fi responded that the cancellation decision had not been based on ratings so much as a feeling the series had run its course. Some of the main characters in SG-1 re-appear later in episodes of Atlantis and Universe and in the direct-to-DVD sequel films, [...] and [...]|$|E

Soon after, a couple of thugs from a Muay Thai camp ask her if she has seen the box. They force their way into her flat, only to be killed, accidentally.|$|R
