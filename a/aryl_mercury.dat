40|$|A {{variable}} temperature ^ 13 C and ^ 199 Hg NMR {{study has}} been conducted for diphenyl-, bis(o-tolyl) -, bis(m-tolyl) -, and bis(2, 6 -xylyl) mercury in dimethyl sulfoxide and 1, 1, 2, 2 tetrachloroethane; ^ 13 C T 1 relaxation times are reported {{as a function of}} temperature. Barriers to rotation of the aryl rings are obtained. Chemical shifts and couplings in CDCl_ 3 are given for bis(p-tolyl) -, bis(2, 5 -xylyl) -, bis(mesityl) -,phenyl(o-tolyl) -, phenyl(m-tolyl) mercury, and the compounds listed above. The steric interactions of these <b>aryl</b> <b>mercury</b> compounds are discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe new heteroleptic mercury(II) complex PhHgN(SiMe 3) 2 (1) {{reacts with}} the strong Brønsted acid [H(OEt 2) 2][H 2 N{B(C 6 F 5) 3 } 2] with {{cleavage}} of a N–Si bond to give [C 6 H 5 Hg(H 2 NSiMe 3) ][H 2 N{B(C 6 F 5) 3 } 2] (2), a phenyl–mercury(II) cation stabilised by a primary amine and a non-coordinating counter-anion. Attempts to generate donor-free <b>aryl</b> <b>mercury</b> cations were not successful. The crystal structure of 2. CH 2 Cl 2 shows short p-bonding interactions between the metal and the phenyl ring of a neighbouring cation; the geometry about the mercury(II) atom is nearly linear. The X-ray structures of the new salts [H 2 N(SiMe 3) 2. H 3 NSiMe 3][B(C 6 F 5) 4] 2 and [Et 3 O][H 2 N{B(C 6 F 5) 3 } 2]. CH 2 Cl 2 are also presented...|$|E
40|$|Several {{groups of}} oxygen heterocycles have been {{prepared}} utilizing organopalladium chemistry. The first group synthesized were butenolides. The strategy employed for their synthesis involved the palladium(II) -assisted intramolecular cyclization of organomercurials containing acyclic olefin and ester functionality. A variety of substitution patterns were examined. The second group of oxygen heterocycles obtained were bicyclic lactones and bicyclic acetals. The method used for {{the preparation of the}} bicyclic lactones involved the palladium(II) -assisted intramolecular cyclization of organomercurials containing cyclic olefin and ester functionality. Several substituted bicyclic lactones were obtained. Bicyclic acetals were generated via a novel oxypalladation reaction from cyclic allylic alcohols and vinyl ethers. The scope and limitations of this oxypalladation reaction were examined. Benzofurans were prepared utilizing two methods. The first approach involved the palladium(II) -assisted cyclization of allylic <b>aryl</b> ethers containing <b>mercury</b> functionality. The second approach examined the palladium(0) -catalyzed intramolecular cyclization of allylic aryl ethers containing iodide functionality. Several substituted benzofurans were subsequently synthesized...|$|R
