Conceptually, performance auditing is a misnomer for a class of mainly evaluative review activities.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{understand}} the role of audit in managing {{the performance of the}} NHS in Scotland and the impact which the relationship between performance and audit has upon key actors, including NHS organisations and national <b>audit</b> <b>bodies.</b> It is informed by Michael Power’s Audit Society (1999) and associated works, which present audit as a collection of ideas which shape how society defines control, accountability and transparency. The premise of this doctoral research is that the age of performance assessment in the NHS is evidence of Power’s Audit Society in action. A longitudinal analysis of annual Overview Reports produced by Audit Scotland, which symbolise the national <b>audit</b> <b>body’s</b> identity relative to the NHS, explores the impact which the performance assessment regime had upon the evolution of the national <b>audit</b> <b>body</b> and demonstrates the capacity of a national <b>audit</b> <b>body</b> to forge its own role in performance assessment and in doing so shift its identity from traditional external auditor to authoritative commentator on performance. A recent performance crisis in a Scottish NHS board {{is the subject of a}} case study which explores the role of audit when significant gaming is uncovered in a previously high-trust system. This case demonstrates how the ritual appeal of audit can be mobilised by the government to restore public confidence in reported improvements in performance across the whole NHS. The organisational impact of audit on performance management is explored through an observation-based case study set in a Scottish NHS board, which traces interactions between the main actors in audit and performance networks. These analyses show how audit can permeate the performance assessment of NHS bodies, at both the national and organisational level, even where it is not given a formal role in the assessment framework...|$|R

40|$|This master’s project adds to {{the body}} of {{knowledge}} on the status of auditing and accreditation in carbon accounting. It addresses three questions regarding greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting (carbon accounting) and auditing: (1) What is the current status of GHG auditing globally?, (2) What are some of the key challenges in auditing?, and (3) Is there an expressed need for greater harmonization, and if so, what are the main obstacles to harmonization and how can they be overcome? To answer these questions two separate surveys were deployed, one to auditors who conduct the review of GHG assertions and a second to accreditation bodies who oversee the quality of work performed by the auditors. Survey results support existing research which suggests that certification standards for sustainability reporting are increasingly being promulgated and adopted by organizations across the world. Certification standards frequently require that an organization undergo an audit. The results of these surveys show an increase in demand for the services of <b>audit</b> <b>bodies</b> and a growth in the development of accreditation programs to oversee the competence and impartiality of the <b>audit</b> <b>bodies.</b> Results also show that there are challenges associated with this growth. The key challenge cited by <b>audit</b> <b>bodies</b> is complying with the multitude of GHG reporting requirements as well as multiple accreditation requirements. One <b>audit</b> <b>body</b> may be required to understand and apply many GHG auditing standards and may also be required to maintain a different accreditation for each standard. Accreditation bodies expressed (1) the need for greater harmonization and (2) the importance of training on GHG reporting and auditing. Recommendations on how to facilitate this harmonization include increased dialog on this subject within existing international forums; training, guidance and case studies to facilitate common understanding on the subject; and the development of Multilateral Recognition Arrangements (MRAs) of accreditation providers. Harmonization is essential in successfully linking regional and national climate change programs such that one ton of carbon measured in one country is the same as one ton of carbon measured in another...|$|R

Our paper reports on an empirical study of 17 auditors and 22 representatives of VfM client organisations.

Questions were raised about {{the relevance of the}} auditors' experience and knowledge of the <b>audited</b> <b>body's</b> activities. Our results also indicate significant role conflicts in the VfM process. Three types of conflict could be identified: (a) conflict between the VfM auditors' roles and their own professional values and standards (person-role conflict); (b) conflict between the VfM auditors' capabilities and their role requirements (role overload), and (c) conflict between the auditors and the auditees (inter-sender conflict) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} Thesis is to {{to provide}} {{empirical}} explanations for the perceptions of external auditors and clients (professionals and Operational Managers in the UK Public Sector organisations), {{in regard to the}} Value for Money (VfM) audit’s ability to improve performance in the UK Public Sector organisations. The main source of the data was face-to-face semi-structured interviews with auditors from the National Audit Office, The Audit Commission and other accounting firms from the UK Private Sector. Senior professionals and Operational Managers from the National Health Service, Local Government Authorities, the Police Service and Housing Associations were also interviewed. The evidence is organised with the following aims; (1) to investigate the audit expectations and perception gaps between the external VfM auditors and their clients, i. e. professionals and Operational Managers in the UK Public Sector organisations, while identifying the nature of potential role conflicts in the VfM audit environment along with the causes and consequences of such potential conflicts; (2) to examine, both from the auditor and client perspectives, the impact of the VfM audit on the audited bodies’ performance and to determine whether the VfM audit has effected any changes in the way these organisations manage public resources, and (3), to examine, from the external VfM auditors’ and clients’ perspectives, the impact of the VfM audit on the UK Public Sector <b>audited</b> <b>bodies,</b> while investigating {{the ways in which the}} interplay of personal, interpersonal and external factors can enhance or hinder its effective performance. The results show that, among other tools, the VfM audit has been perceived as an important means with which to improve institutional performances in the Public Sector, but the VfM audit has not yet been internalised in the <b>audited</b> <b>bodies</b> as previously assumed. The results indicate the existence of clear audit expectationss and perception gaps within the VfM audit environment. Clients expect the external VfM auditors, firstly, to identify areas where their performance needs to be improved and then to suggest solutions in order to remedy the problems and improve performance in the <b>audited</b> <b>bodies.</b> According to official documentary evidence, these expectationss have been regarded as unreasonable, with the assumption being that the auditors should not be involved in working with the <b>audited</b> <b>bodies</b> to find out solutions to remedy problems, as this might impair their independence. The findings of this study also show that, while the majority of the auditors interviewed took an extremely positive view of their own achievements in terms of improving public institutions’ performances and delivering VfM services, the majority of the clients, and some of the auditors interviewed, were not convinced of the external auditors’ competence to carry out a VfM audit effectively, and to provide their clients with value added recommendations. The major concern seems to be in regard to the auditors’ relevant experience and knowledge of the <b>audited</b> <b>body’s</b> activities, the materiality of their findings and the truth and fairness of their reports In addition, the results show that audit expectationss and perception gaps between the external VfM auditors and their clients give rise to significant role conflicts. Three types of role conflicts have been identified; (a) conflict between the external VfM auditors’ roles and their own professional values and standards (person-role conflict); (b) conflict between the external VfM auditors’ actual capabilities and their role requirements (role overload), and (c) conflict between the external VfM auditors and their clients (intersender conflict). Moreover, this study has revealed that social factors at the personal (the VfM auditors’ competence based on their relevant skills, experience and knowledge of the Public bodies’ activities), interpersonal (task interdependence between the external VfM auditors and the clients) and external levels (the ambiguity of the VfM audit process), all have negative effects on the influence of the external VfM auditors over the <b>audited</b> <b>bodies,</b> hindering the effective performance of the VfM audit. Finally, the findings reported in this study suggest that there is a necessity for more studies to examine both the VfM audit’s effective performance and impact on the <b>audited</b> <b>bodies,</b> especially in view of the constant change which characterises both Public Sector organisations, as well as the remits of the VfM audit as a tool to improve performance...|$|R

40|$|Since {{incorporation}} {{in fiscal}} 2004, national universities have undertaken institutional reforms of their governing structure and discretionary budgeting, {{in an effort}} to improve efficiency by strengthening incentives through autonomy and independence. As a result of these efforts, national universities have established a governance system with the university president {{at the core of the}} institution in order to conduct voluntary, efficient and effective university management. But is this structure functioning as effectively as originally intended? To date, no data-based empirical verification has taken place in order to answer this question. Therefore, this paper uses data to verify the effect of the governing structure of national universities on their financial performance. By estimating the governance of universities using variables that show the decision making of the board of directors and the <b>auditing</b> <b>body</b> and the leadership of the president as organizational factors, we see that improved decision-making by the board of directors and the <b>auditing</b> <b>body</b> and stronger leadership by the president reduces the dependence on subsidies and raises the proportions of donations, funded research, and funded businesses. It also becomes clear that stronger leadership by the president reduces the ratio of personnel expenses and raises research expenses for individual teaching staff and that greater involvement by the <b>auditing</b> <b>body</b> in decision making lowers educational expenses per-student. Given that the purpose of incorporation is the efficient management of a university by creating a governance structure based on stronger presidential authority, it is possible to view the results of this paper as an indication that the objectives sought by the institutional reforms are headed toward fruition. It is hoped that as university presidents exercise their leadership roles, we will see the creation of a governance system that will ensure the quality of education and research and improve financial efficiency. ...|$|R
