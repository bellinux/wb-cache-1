40|$|A graph {{dynamical}} system (GDS) is {{a theoretical}} construct {{that can be}} used to simulate and analyze the dynamics of contagion processes on network representations of systems. One of our goals is to compute the phase space of a system (i. e., the set of all transitions for each state of the system), <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>this,</b> <b>even</b> 30 -vertex graphs present a computational challenge. This is because the number of states is exponential in the number of graph vertices. We implement several algorithms for phase space computations based on naive approaches, and based on more recent graph dynamical systems theory. We find that MapReduce is not well suited for these types of computations. While we observe improvements in execution times with algorithmic improvements, these improvements are not sufficient to overcome inefficiencies of MapReduce for these types of computations. We present a detailed set of observations explaining system performance. Future work entails executing our algorithms on Apache Spark.

Topics of the interviews included {{the amount of time}} they spend on Facebook on their mobile phones and how often, why they are using it on this device and when they rather use a computer. The results of the interviews indicate that people mostly use their mobile phone on their every-day journeys, esp. while they use public transport and they are bored waiting for or beeing on the means of transport. Often they just check the Newsfeed to see what their friends are doing. They mainly want to be informed about the activities of their friends, therefore, produce less content themselves on Facebook Mobile rather than on their computer. The questioned users do not have the feeling they need to log in on Facebook, instead they do it subconsciously all the time. The small screen and keypad on the mobile phone are still the main reasons why {{the usage of}} Facebook on the computer is more convenient.

40|$|O cântico de Judite 16, 1 - 12, síntese da parte em prosa do livro, faz memória da ação do Deus de Israel em favor dos oprimidos, libertando-os do poder dos impérios opressores. No centro do poema (v. 5), situa-se a ação do Todo-poderoso por mão de fêmea. A vitória de Judite é uma ironia não só à guerra, mas também às mulheres. Por um lado, as armas utilizadas pela mulher, para matar o comandante-em-chefe beleza do rosto, perfumes, veste festiva, sandália, diadema nos cabelos, são aparentemente insignificantes diante do poderio do exército inimigo, o que representa a vitória dos fracos sobre os fortes. Por outro, numa sociedade patriarcal e androcêntrica, beleza e sedução são consideradas como armas essencialmente femininas. Assim, enquanto a narrativa diverte a audiência, ela adverte aos homens que a mulher bela é perigosa, e, por sua causa, até o general mais poderoso pode perder a cabeça. Entre os séculos 4 a. C. e 2 d. C., há muitas narrativas judaicas que ressaltam o perigo de se olhar para uma mulher bela. No contexto dos movimentos sociais de resistência do período helenista, a {{literatura}} historiográfica acentua o protagonismo dos homens, enquanto a ação da mulher como protagonista só aparece no campo da ficção, e ainda para reforçar a atuação masculina. Ler Judite 16, 1 - 12 a partir da ótica de gênero nos desafia a compreender os mecanismos que continuam expropriando o corpo e o desejo de mulheres e homens. É um convite para entoarmos novos cânticos, pautados por relações entre iguais, numa vivência solidária e de reciprocidade. (AU) The canticle of Judith 16, 1 - 12, {{a synthesis}} of the prose part of the book, {{reminds us of the}} action of the God of Israel on behalf of the oppressed, liberating them from the power of the imperial oppressors. In the centre of the poem, (v. 5) is placed the action of the All-powerful through the hand of the female. The victory of Judith is an irony not only of war, but also of women. On one side, the weapons used by the woman to kill the commander-in-chief the facial beauty, the festive dress, the sandals, the tiara in her hair, are apparently insignificant before the might of the enemy, which represent the victory of the weak over the strong. On the other hand, in a patriarchal and male-dominated society, beauty and seduction are considered as essential feminine weapons. Thus while the narrative distracts the audience, it warns the men that the beauiful woman is dangerous, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason <b>even</b> the most powerful general can lose his head. Between the centuries 4 BC and 2 AD, there are many Judaic narratives which project the danger of looking at a beautiful woman. In the context of social resistence movements of the Helenistic period, {{to such an extent that}} historiographic literature accentuates the protagonism of men, whereas the action of the woman as protagonist only appears in the field of activity of fiction and furthermore to reinforce male action. To read Judith 16, 1 - 12 from the optic of gender challenges us to comprehend the mechanisms which continue expropriating the body and desires of women and men. It is an invitation to sing new canticles based on relations among equals in a mutual and reciprocal manner of living. (AU...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} paper {{is a critical}} approach to the external music in Nimayian poetry. We have examined some topics with examples of contemporary poetry, topics such as wrap method, {{the end of the}} hemistich, the use of prosodic options, and misleading effect of external music in Nimayian poetry. We also have detected shortcomings at the laws of prosody, done by the scholars, or the implementation of the law, by the poets. We tried to add some provisions and amendments to previous laws, to make it easier <b>for</b> scholars <b>and</b> poets to recognize the intricacies of external music in Nimayian poetry and get the best out of it.   This article has five parts. Here are the contents of each section separately and summarily: 1. Wrap method in Nimayian poetry Most of the great poets, accepted wrap based on prosody`s law, but sometimes the law is in contrast with the meaning of sentences, and poet is forced to move short part of  a sentence in one hemistich to another or A sentence has to be divided into several parts. It is better to match the sentence structure to the structure of prosody. Isolated short parts of a sentence and use of one or two syllables in each hemistich are signs of poet`s weakness in prosody. 2. The end of hemistiches Contrary to popular belief, making hemistiches Short or long is not completely free in Nimayian poetry, because short syllables at the end of hemistiches considered as long syllables and if we end the hemistiches with short syllables the mathematical order in syllables chain will fail.   3. Prosodic options and necessities Use of prosodic options in Nimayian poetry sometimes can be the reason of dissonance in the external music and make it difficult to understand the main meter, because In classic poems equality of hemistiches help us to find the meter, but in Nimayian poetry hemistiches are unequal and sometimes in short hemistiches by utilization of one prosodic option or necessities, the external music seems abnormal.    This section has four parts: 1 / 3. Prosodic options and necessities in first hemistich of poem  Meter is still not known in first Hemistich of poem, and use of prosodic options and Necessities can make it difficult to understand the true meter, therefore it is better to not using it in this Place.   2 / 3. Taskin  It is better to not using taskin at the end of hemistich and if you did, you should not repeat it in several line, because if you do, the meter seems different. 3 / 3. Eshba' in one-syllabic words It is better to not using eshba' in one-syllabic words, because it is not appealing in the musical aesthetics. 4 / 3. Several prosodic options and necessities in one hemistich According to the musical aesthetics using several prosodic options and necessities in one hemistich of poem is not pleasant.   4. Unexpandability of external music in some meters Meters with united prosodic elements are easily comprehensible and in each of the long syllables, the hemistich can be finished, but in meters with intermittent prosodic elements which are made of two different prosodic elements, the elimination of one element and finishing hemistiches is impermissible. 5. Misleading effect of external music Long and short of hemistiches in some meters is misleading, specifically in this syllables chain: «- -  U - U -  U U - - U - U - [...] . » In classic poems, long and short of hemistiches are not permitted and we can recognize prosodic false by counting syllables, but in Nimayian poetry hemistiches are unequal and sometimes detecting prosodic false is difficult <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason, <b>even</b> great poets in Nimayian poetry made mistakes in prosody. We have given some examples in this regard...|$|R
