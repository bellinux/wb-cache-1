5|$|While {{living in}} London Hogg made the {{acquaintance}} of several well-known writers, and he published literary works of his own. He studied Greek literature {{for much of}} his life and published several articles on the subject, including two entries in the Encyclopædia Britannica. Most of the fiction he wrote was poorly reviewed. His best-known literary work was The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley, an unfinished biography of the poet. Although the book was well researched and painted <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>picture</b> of Shelley as a young man, it was criticised for portraying him negatively.|$|E
5|$|With {{this dispute}} settled {{collaboration}} could once again take place. Chadwick wanted to involve as many British scientists {{as possible so}} long as Groves accepted them. Chadwick's first choice, Joseph Rotblat {{refused to give up}} his Polish citizenship. Chadwick then turned to Otto Frisch, who to Chadwick's surprise accepted becoming a British citizen right away and began the screening process so that he could travel to America. Chadwick spent the first few weeks of November 1943 acquiring <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>picture</b> of the extensive Manhattan Project. He realised the scale of such sites as Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which was the new headquarters of the project, and could safely conclude that without similar industrial site being found in Germany the chances of the Nazi atomic bomb project being successful was very low.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{the night}} {{different}} opposing ships {{came into contact}} in an arc as the German fleet proceeded from west to east across {{the tail of the}} British fleet. The two fleets were on similar courses so the encounter was drawn out over several hours, but at no time did the British get <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>picture</b> of what was happening. The action was characterised by determination and nerve on the German side to keep a steady course despite continual encounters with British destroyers, but by confusion and failure to report events by the British. Individual British ships showed considerable courage and determination in carrying out attacks, but their efforts were spoilt by confusion, which meant many ships turned away from possible targets, uncertain that they were enemy vessels.|$|E
25|$|Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) {{analysis}} involves {{creating an}} inventory of flows from and to nature for a product system. Inventory flows include inputs of water, energy, and raw materials, and releases to air, land, and water. To develop the inventory, a flow model of the technical system is constructed using data on inputs and outputs. The flow model is typically illustrated with a flow chart that includes the activities {{that are going to}} be assessed in the relevant supply chain and gives <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>picture</b> of the technical system boundaries. The input and output data needed for the construction of the model are collected for all activities within the system boundary, including from the supply chain (referred to as inputs from the technosphere).|$|E

25|$|Thanks to his scouts, Archduke John had <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>picture</b> of his opponent's army. He ordered Frimont's {{advance guard}} {{to attack the}} French {{soldiers}} at Pordenone in the morning. At 6:00 am, the Austrians clashed with Sahuc's cavalry patrols. General-major Joseph von Wetzel's Grenz brigade attacked across the Noncello (Foncello) stream {{on the east side}} of the town, attracting the attention of the defending infantry. When General-major Josef von Schmidt's line brigade came down from the northeast, the French were compelled to stretch the 35th Line to cover the north side of town. Sahuc formed his horsemen north of the town, hoping to catch the Austrian attackers in the flank. But it was the French cavalry who were flanked when Frimont fell on them with four regiments of cavalry, routing them. Without cavalry support, the infantry in the town were forced to pull out.|$|E
25|$|There are two generic ideas how to {{visualize}} the Pareto front in high-order multi-objective decision problems (problems with more than two objectives). One of them, which is applicable {{in the case of}} a relatively small number of objective points that represent the Pareto front, is based on using the visualization techniques developed in statistics (various diagrams, etc. – see the corresponding subsection below). The second idea proposes the display of bi-objective cross-sections (slices) of the Pareto front. It was introduced by W.S. Meisel in 1973 who argued that such slices inform the decision maker on objective tradeoffs. The figures that display a series of bi-objective slices of the Pareto front for three-objective problems are known as the decision maps. They give <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>picture</b> of tradeoffs between three criteria. Disadvantages of such an approach are related to two following facts. First, the computational procedures for constructing the bi-objective slices of the Pareto front are not stable since the Pareto front is usually not stable. Secondly, it is applicable in the case of only three objectives. In the 1980s, the idea W.S. Meisel of implemented in a different form – in the form of the Interactive Decision Maps (IDM) technique.|$|E
