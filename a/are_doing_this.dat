5|$|Visiting his wife's parents {{during the}} middle of the night, Peter informs Carter that he is now his {{personal}} slave, and must perform any task he wishes, including having a limousine joust and writing witty catchphrases. Noticing Peter and Carter spending time together, Barbara and Lois soon witness the two taking a high-definition television out of the house. But while they <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this,</b> Peter accidentally spills the beans to Barbara about the affair, and Barbera is instantly devastated by this and runs of the room sobbing.|$|E

25|$|The party then learns of {{one last}} hope of {{stopping}} Melodia and Malpercio: the Magnus of Life. This power is {{counter to the}} End Magnus which currently empower Malpercio, and that this power was used to create Kalas and his brother, Fee. Kalas, however, was too human for Geldoblame's liking and only had one wing, so Geldoblame had ordered his termination. This leads Georg to blow up his laboratory with explosives and secretly flee to Mira with Kalas and Fee in tow. Due to being a creation of the Magnus of Life, however, Kalas is empowered by it, though he does not yet know how to tap into this power. The group decide to tie up some loose ends from their journey so they can learn to harness the Magnus of Life's tremendous power. While they <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this,</b> it is decided that the islands shall launch a massive assault against Cor Hydrae's barrier. The purpose {{is to create a}} hole in it so Kalas' party can enter by flying the White Dragon into it.|$|E
500|$|QED is {{organised}} by skeptics {{volunteers and}} any proceeds {{go back into}} the event or a charity. On the [...] "Token Skeptic" [...] podcast Michael Marshall said, [...] "How we try to always pitch it and how we try and run it is - it's all about the skeptical community. Because its being run by people who are just part of that community who <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> because we really love it, the atmosphere, seems to be, of people coming together. It's kind of a big party, a celebration of UK skepticism and also international skepticism".|$|E
500|$|When James and Kristen awaken, it is morning, {{and they}} are tied to chairs {{in the living room}} with the masked strangers {{standing}} before them. Kristen asks them why they <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this,</b> to which the blonde woman replies, [...] "because you were home". The strangers then unmask themselves to the couple offscreen, and take turns stabbing the couple in the stomach and chest before leaving. They drive past two young boys on bicycles who are distributing religious tracts. Dollface asks for a tract. The boy asks if she's a sinner and she replies, [...] "sometimes". The strangers drive away, as the pin-up girl states, [...] "it'll be easier next time". The two boys come upon the house and discover the chaotic scene, including the bodies of Kristen, James and Mike inside. One boy approaches Kristen's body, and as he reaches out to her, she wakes up and screams.|$|E

500|$|NME {{gave the}} album {{a score of}} six out of ten: [...] "It tails off towards the end, and TBS never quite shake the feeling that other people <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> sort of thing far more thrillingly elsewhere." [...] Now {{reviewer}} Evan Davies wrote that although the group's fans and label had expectations, it [...] "doesn't {{mean you have to}} put out the exact same fucking album twice in a row." [...] According to Davies, Taking Back Sunday writes two kinds of songs: [...] "energetic pop rock with whiny vocals, and midtempo power rock, again with whiny vocals." [...] Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone wrote that the group [...] "amped up their sound," [...] with Valentine [...] "delivering a turbocharged attack spiked with dark, catchy melodies and giant choruses." [...] Hoard called most of the album's songs [...] "skull-rattling slasher with enough pop smarts to keep the heartbroken agony from becoming too much to handle." [...] For Stylus Magazine, Ian Cohen wrote that the album [...] "tables the discussion" [...] of whether Taking Back Sunday [...] "embrace their arena destiny or disappear into the basement for cred that never really existed." [...] Cohen concluded, [...] "As was the case with pop-metal, 'albums' weren't the objective, so much as a few ace singles and album tracks that hold serve, which is Louder Now in a nutshell." ...|$|E
500|$|Three years later, in the {{build-up}} to {{the release}} of Manhunt 2, the controversy re-ignited. Two days after announcing the game, which was set for release in July, Take-Two Interactive (Rockstar's parent company) issued a statement which read, in part: [...] "We are aware that in direct contradiction to all available evidence, certain individuals continue to link the original Manhunt title to the Warren Leblanc case in 2004. The transcript of the court case makes it quite clear what really happened. At sentencing the Judge, defense, prosecution and Leicester police all emphasized that Manhunt played no part in the case." [...] Later that day, however, Patrick and Giselle Pakeerah condemned the decision to release a sequel, and insisted that Manhunt was a factor in their son's murder. Upon the announcement of the sequel, Patrick stated [...] "I'm very disappointed. This is rubbing salt into the wounds in the month we will be marking the anniversary of Stefan's death. I'm very surprised they <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> after all that has happened and all the publicity." [...] Giselle added [...] "It is an insult to my son's memory that they have announced this game in the month we will be marking this anniversary. These game moguls are {{making a lot of money}} out of games which are morally indecent. Why do they have to pump more violence into society?" [...] Leicester East MP Keith Vaz supported the Pakeerahs, claiming he was [...] "astonished" [...] that Rockstar were making a sequel; [...] "It is contempt for those who are trying very hard to ensure something is done to control the violent nature of these games." ...|$|E
500|$|Peter and Chris set up traps {{for each}} other as they fight. Lois then gets sick of the boys fighting, so the monkey tricks Peter and Chris into coming to dinner together. Chris and Peter admit they don't hate each other and vow to spend more time together. As they <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this,</b> they see Brian and Stewie running away from the chaotic Miley who is smashing vehicles, shops and houses. The monkey confronts her, and {{attempts}} to talk her out of her rampage (as well as her career), but Miley ends up kidnapping him and takes him {{to the top of a}} nearby skyscraper. Fortunately, Peter is able to recruit his neighbor, Quagmire, to shoot her down in a biplane, and a battle with Miley starts escalating. The monkey falls out of her hands and he grips onto a narrow ledge with one hand. Miley's skin, hair and clothes peel off, revealing her android skeleton and she tries to kill Peter and Quagmire with a rock, but fails. Eventually, she is pummelled off the top. Afterwards, the monkey falls off the ledge but is saved by Peter just before he hits the road far below. Stewie and Brian then see the broken Miley, where Stewie says Brian can now have sex with her, but Miley blows up seconds later. Stewie apologizes to Brian for missing his chance for sexual intercourse with Miley but then her dismembered arm falls back out of the sky in front of them and Brian wags his tails in excitement and tells Stewie that it's not too late to have sex with her, anticipating what's to happen with him next with her hand. Monkey then moves out of Chris's closet, and his friendly attitude also parts ways with him, saying he will [...] "go where he's needed", and moves to Tom Tucker's upside-down-faced son Jake's closet as his new haunt.|$|E

2500|$|The club {{held their}} {{annual general meeting}} on 16 September 1993, and {{commercial}} manager Geoff Warburton announced that the reports showed a loss of only £6,999 for the year.

2500|$|Today many {{multiple}} pregnancies are {{the result}} of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and [...]08% quadruplets). Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made {{to reduce the risk of}} multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.|$|E
2500|$|One other {{use that}} is being {{discussed}} {{is the use of}} social networks in the science communities. Julia Porter Liebeskind et al. have published a study on how new biotechnology firms are using social networking sites to share exchanges in scientific knowledge. They state in their study that by sharing information and knowledge with one another, they are able to [...] "increase both their learning and their flexibility in ways that would not be possible within a self-contained hierarchical organization". Social networking is allowing scientific groups to expand their knowledge base and share ideas, and without these new means of communicating their theories might become [...] "isolated and irrelevant". Researchers use social networks frequently to maintain and develop professional relationships. They are interested in consolidating social ties and professional contact, keeping in touch with friends and colleagues and seeing what their own contacts <b>are</b> <b>doing.</b> <b>This</b> can be related to their need to keep updated on the activities and events of their friends and colleagues in order to establish collaborations on common fields of interest and knowledge sharing.|$|E
