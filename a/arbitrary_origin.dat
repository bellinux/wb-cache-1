That is, we want to preprocess them into a data structure, so that the first intersection point of a query ray and the given polyhedra can be determined quickly. We describe data structures that require Õ(n · poly(k)) preprocessing time and storage (where the Õ(·) notation hides polylogarithmic factors), and have polylogarithmic query time, for several special instances of the problem. These include the case when the ray origins are restricted to lie on a fixed line ℓ 0, but the directions of the rays are arbitrary, the more general case when the supporting lines of the rays pass through ℓ 0, and the case of rays orthogonal to some fixed line with <b>arbitrary</b> <b>origins</b> and orientations.

60|$|I cannot {{now think}} symbols {{less than the}} {{greatest}} of all powers whether they are used consciously by the masters of magic, or half unconsciously by their successors, the poet, the musician and the artist. At first I tried to distinguish between symbols and symbols, between what I called inherent symbols and arbitrary symbols, but the distinction has come to mean little or nothing. Whether their power has arisen out of themselves, or whether it has an <b>arbitrary</b> <b>origin,</b> matters little, for they act, as I believe, because the great memory associates them with certain events and moods and persons. Whatever the passions of man have gathered about, becomes a symbol in the great memory, and in the hands of him who has the secret, it is a worker of wonders, a caller-up of angels or of devils. The symbols are of all kinds, for everything in heaven or earth has its association, momentous or trivial, in the great memory, and one never knows what forgotten events may have plunged it, like the toadstool and the ragweed, into the great passions. Knowledgeable men and women in Ireland sometimes distinguish between the simples that work cures by some medical property in the herb, and those that do their work by magic. Such magical simples as the husk of the flax, water out of the fork of an elm-tree, do their work, as I think, by awaking {{in the depths of the}} mind where it mingles with the great mind, and is enlarged by the great memory, some curative energy, some hypnotic command. They are not what we call faith cures, for they have been much used and successfully, the traditions of all lands affirm, over children and over animals, and to me they seem the only medicine that could have been committed safely to ancient hands. To pluck the wrong leaf would have been to go uncured, but, if one had eaten it, one might have been poisoned.|$|E
60|$|Not {{only had}} wise {{counsellors}} been tried; consultative assemblies had been tried also. Necker had been dismissed in 1781, after publishing the memorable Report which first initiated {{the nation in}} the elements of financial knowledge. The disorder waxed greater, and the monarchy drew nearer to bankruptcy each year. The only modern parallel to the state of things in France under Lewis the Sixteenth is to be sought in the state of things in Egypt or in Turkey. Lewis the Fourteenth had left a debt of between two and three thousand millions of livres, but this had been wiped out by the heroic operations of Law; operations, by the way, which have never yet been scientifically criticised. But the debt soon grew again, by foolish wars, by the prodigality of the court, and by the rapacity of the nobles. It amounted in 1789 to something like two hundred and forty millions sterling; and it is interesting to notice that this was exactly the sum of the public debt of Great Britain at the same time. The year's excess of expenditure over receipts in 1774 was about fifty millions of livres: in 1787 it was one hundred and forty millions, or according to a different computation even two hundred millions. The material case was not at all desperate, if only the court had been less infatuated, and the spirit of the privileged orders had been less blind and less vile. The fatality of the situation lay in the characters of a handful of men and women. For France was abundant in resources, and even at this moment was far from unprosperous, in spite of the incredible trammels of law and custom. An able financier, with the support of a popular chamber and the assent of the sovereign, could have had no difficulty in restoring the public credit. But the conditions, simple as they might seem to a patriot or to posterity, were unattainable so long as power remained with a caste that were anything we please except patriots. An Assembly of Notables was brought together, but it was only the empty phantasm of national representation. Yet the situation was so serious that even this body, of <b>arbitrary</b> <b>origin</b> as it was, still was willing to accept vital reforms. The privileged order, who were then as their descendants are now, the worst conservative party in Europe, immediately persuaded the magisterial corporation to resist the Notables. The judicial corporation or Parlement of Paris had been suppressed under Lewis the Fifteenth, and unfortunately revived again at the accession of his grandson. By the inconvenient constitution of the French government, the assent of that body was indispensable to fiscal legislation, on the ground that such legislation was part of the general police of the realm. The king's minister, now Loménie de Brienne, devised a new judicial constitution. But the churchmen, the nobles, and the lawyers all united in protestations against such a blow. The common people are not always the best judges of a remedy for the evils under which they are the greatest sufferers, and they broke out in disorder both in Paris and the provinces. They discerned an attack upon their local independence. Nobody would accept office in the new courts, and the administration of justice was at a standstill. A loan was thrown upon the market, but the public could not be persuaded to take it up. It was impossible to collect the taxes. The interest on the national debt was unpaid, and the fundholder was dismayed and exasperated by an announcement that only two-fifths would be discharged in cash. A very large part of the national debt was held in the form of annuities for lives, and men who had invested their savings on the credit of the government, saw themselves left without a provision. The total number of fundholders cannot be ascertained with any precision, but it must have been very considerable, especially in Paris and the other great cities. Add to these all the civil litigants in the kingdom, who had portions of their property virtually sequestrated by the suspension of the courts into which the property had been taken. The resentment of this immense body of defrauded public creditors and injured private suitors explains the alienation of the middle class from the monarchy. In the convulsions of our own time, the moneyed interests have been on one side, and the population without money on the other. But in the first and greatest convulsion, those who had nothing to lose found their animosities shared by those who had had something to lose, and had lost it.|$|E

The fundamental question that is asked when studying nonequilibrium systems, in particular when calculating transport coefficients is the following.

50|$|When {{discussing}} the dipole moment of a non-neutral system, {{such as the}} dipole moment of the proton, a dependence on the choice of reference point arises. In such cases it is conventional to choose the reference point {{to be the center}} of mass of the system, not some <b>arbitrary</b> <b>origin.</b> This choice is not only a matter of convention: the notion of dipole moment is essentially derived from the mechanical notion of torque, and as in mechanics, it is computationally and theoretically useful to choose the center of mass as the observation point. For a charged molecule the center of charge should be the reference point instead of the center of mass. For neutral systems the references point is not important. The dipole moment is an intrinsic property of the system.|$|E
50|$|In Eqs. (1) to (4), X, Y, and Z {{represent}} the three coordinates {{of a point}} in the three-dimensional space which is at rest with respect to the ether. The values for X, Y, and Z can be determined in the frame of the ether by using meter-sticks to measure the projection of the distance between an <b>arbitrary</b> <b>origin</b> and the point (X,Y,Z) along three arbitrarily assigned, mutually orthogonal axes. T represents the time advance in the ether rest frame. Time can be measured using clocks at rest in the ether. X', Y', and Z' {{represent the}} three coordinates of a coordinate system set up by preferred frame observers that moves with a velocity U with respect to the ether rest frame. T' is the time associated by preferred frame observers with the moving coordinate system. The numerical values of X', Y', Z', and T' can be determined for the moving coordinate system by using Eqs. (1) to (4). Equations (1) to (4), the Galilean transformations, are the only transformations of space and time that retain the classical meaning of space and time. Thus it is assumed in both the Lorentz theory and the theory proposed herein that coordinate representations of time and space transform via Eqs. (1) to (4), but modifications of measuring instruments caused by motion through the ether cause moving observers to infer incorrect coordinate systems for their moving frames. Note {{that this is the first}} crucial conceptual difference between relativity and the absolute theories. Relativity assumes that time and space are transformed by relative motion, and that all observers are on an equal footing with regard to determinations of space and time. Absolute theories assume a fixed space and one universal time with one well-defined simultaneity. Since absolute theories assume a single well-defined space and time, no transformations of these concepts are allowed. It is possible, however, to transform to a moving coordinate system and use such a system to describe the single space and time. In absolute theories one can set up a coordinate system in a moving frame via a Galilean transformation, but this is not a transformation of space; rather, it is a transformation of the coordinate system used to define the one existing space.|$|E

40|$|Solute {{transport}} in three-dimensional aquifers, with spatially varying {{hydraulic conductivity}} of arbitrary point distribution is investigated. The {{basis of our}} study is a multiindicator model (MIM) representation of the heterogeneity, combined with a self-consistent approximation for groundwater flow and particle transport. A time-domain random walk (TDRW) approach is presented for computing the expected mass arrival along the longitudinal transport direction that is simple and honors the hydrodynamics of flow for any variability. Using hydraulic conductivity measurements at the MADE site and the MIM, it is shown that the travel time distribution for large variability, cannot be well reproduced by the common distributions used for modeling hydrological transport, such as the log-normal distribution, or the inverse-Gaussian distribution. The proposed TDRW approach directly relates to the Lagrangian trajectory formulation and is appropriate for applications where occurrence of negative flow velocities is small.

The <b>origin</b> of a low energy feature in the cross section for the reaction of F with H- 2 and its absence for the reaction with D- 2 is investigated. Close-coupling calculations of the scattering matrix show that the F-H- 2 feature arises from the presence of a virtual state associated with the van der Waals well in the entrance channel and that the virtual state is responsible for the enhanced zero temperature rate coefficient of the F-H- 2 reaction. For a mass of about 1. 12 hydrogen masses the virtual state turns into a zero energy resonance and the corresponding zero temperature rate coefficient is I X 10 (- 9) cm(3) s(- 1) despite an energy barrier of 300 K.

Teaching the {{transformation}} of coordinates from North American Datum of 1927 (NAD 27) or an <b>arbitrary</b> <b>origin</b> to North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83) is critical to preparing students for “the real world, ” and {{their understanding of the}} techniques commonly in use through application is very important. Two procedures commonly in use are the Similarity (Helmert) or four-parameter affine and the rigid body or three parameter affine. Both have drawbacks in their execution. The four parameter affine will change the scale, since scale is one of the four parameters. In going from NAD 27 to NAD 83, this is theoretically unacceptable. The three-parameter affine depends on the users choice of {{the transformation}} point. This point, if misidentified, can cause substantial error in the transformation. To illustrate these problems, a procedure was developed that combines the best aspects of the usual “Rigid Body ” (three-parameter affine) and the Similarity (Helmert) Least Squares procedures found in most Civil Engineering enhancements to popular CAD programs. The procedure will work to transform North American Datum of 1927 (NAD 27) coordinates into the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83) system and will also work in transforming arbitrary coordinates (coordinates derived in an arbitrary system) to NAD 83...|$|E
