500|$|Padukone has {{admitted}} to being socially awkward {{as a child}} and did not have many friends. The focus of her life was badminton, which she played competitively from a young age. Describing her daily routine in a 2012 interview, Padukone said, [...] "I would wake up at five in the morning, go for physical training, go to school, again go for playing badminton, finish my homework, and go to sleep." [...] Padukone continued to pursue a career in badminton throughout her school years and played the sport in national level championships. She also played baseball in a few state level tournaments. While concentrating on her education and sporting career, Padukone also worked as a child model, first appearing in a couple of advertising campaigns at the age of eight. In the tenth grade, she changed focus and decided to become a fashion model. She later explained, [...] "I realised that I was playing the game only because it ran in the family. So, I <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> if I could give up the game and he wasn't upset at all." [...] In 2004, she began a full-time career as a model under the tutelage of Prasad Bidapa.|$|E

2500|$|E: Yes, I {{did not do}} it consciously. I saw all the sunset, but I didn't see {{the fence}} and large boulder that were there. I blocked out {{everything}} except the sunset. After I saw the sunset, I lost consciousness for three days. When I finally awakened, I <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> why they had taken out that fence, tree, and boulder. I did not realize I had blotted them out when I fixed my attention so intensely on the sunset. Then, as I recovered and became aware of my lack of abilities, I wondered how I was going to earn a living. I had already published a paper in a national agricultural journal. [...] "Why Young Folks Leave the Farm." [...] I no longer had the strength to be a farmer, but maybe I could make it as a doctor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ask the Zulus," [...] she answered. [...] "They {{understand}} me, {{and they}} will tell you. Or {{if there is no}} time, <b>ask</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and mother--afterwards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My uncle's obstinacy {{must not}} be {{permitted}} to occasion this disaster. Go once more on deck, Jasper; and <b>ask</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> to come into the cabin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Down there. I'm {{going to}} <b>ask</b> <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> I suppose you'll believe {{it if he}} tells you. I suppose you'll believe a Professor of Astronomy knows what--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what may}} that be?" [...] <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> [...] "I would like, sir, {{to make over}} to my Aunt Janet--" [...] My father {{interrupted}} him by asking--he had evidently remembered my jest: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Bass <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{and me to}} {{come down}} for a few days," [...] {{answered}} Cynthia, her color heightening again. Life is full of contrasts, and Cynthia was becoming aware of some of them.|$|E
60|$|At length, after a pause, Mr. Marais, {{pointing}} to myself, {{a small and}} stubbly-haired youth with a sharp nose, <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> whether he would like me to be instructed in the French tongue. The answer was that nothing would please him better.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{out of the}} question, Mrs. Harvey, until I can buy my own dresses. I can't <b>ask</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> to buy {{anything}} more than is strictly necessary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I wish--but it {{is useless}} {{to talk about}} that. I could not presume to <b>ask</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> for a commission--Heaven knows when I shall dare to speak to him!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Richard kindly, [...] "I am {{no doctor}} myself, but I'll <b>ask</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> about you, and perhaps {{he can give}} you an order for the hospital." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> that, and he {{said most}} likely by next Monday. He will want to give us all some {{instructions}} before we leave. And {{he wants us to}} read this book," [...] and Shep drew a small volume from his pocket.|$|E
6000|$|Mother {{saw nothing}} strange {{in the coming}} of the first two carriages, the Buttons often came driving in that way,--but when the Babcocks, the Coles, and the Gilchrists clattered in with smiling faces, we all stood in the yard transfixed with amazement. [...] "What's the meaning of all this?" [...] <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> <b>father.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "If so, friend Athalbrand, {{why did you}} {{not stop}} away?" [...] <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> firing up, then adding quickly: [...] "Nay, no offence; you are welcome here, {{whatever}} your humour, and you too, my daughter that is to be, and you, Steinar, my fosterling, who, as it chances, are come in a good hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What? I! But, as I say, I am only a woman. I should <b>ask</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> for it, or sign {{a receipt}} for my trustees, or {{something}} of that sort." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only that mamma {{has said}} it, and I wouldn't {{seem to go}} against her," [...] said Frank, [...] "I'd <b>ask</b> <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> He wouldn't give way to such nonsense, I know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, we cannot," [...] said Rollo; [...] "and besides, {{they will}} not let you stay, I know. I went {{yesterday}} to <b>ask</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> to let Jonas go with us to-day, and he would not." ...|$|R
60|$|As we trekked along comfortably enough, for {{the road}} was good and the cart, being on springs, gave my leg no pain, I <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> what {{he thought that the}} Heer Marais had meant when he told us that the Boers had {{business}} at Maraisfontein, during which our presence as Englishmen would not be agreeable to them.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{so little}} to tell," [...] she answered. [...] "He {{is a member of}} the firm who publish books for my father. He is quite kind to us both. He used to come down here more often, even, than he does now, and one night he <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> whether he might speak to me." ...|$|E
60|$|That evening, {{after we}} had eaten, Heer Marais <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and myself {{to speak with him}} in the sitting-room. By an afterthought also, or so it seemed to me, he told his daughter, who had been {{clearing}} away the dishes and with whom as yet I had found no opportunity to talk, to come in with us and close the door behind her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Rollo, I {{would not}} mind. If it does rain, I will <b>ask</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{to let me}} stay and play with you to-day, and {{we can have a}} fine time up in your little room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} to come here some other day," [...] added Rollo; [...] "and I mean to <b>ask</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> to let us come. Uncle George will come with us. But now we had better go home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{need not}} <b>ask,</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> if you {{remember}} the Carthusian monk, Clement, and his preachings and lessons; at which indeed you assisted so often, that you cannot be ignorant men called you one of his converts, and with greater justice termed me so likewise?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And what {{is there}} to {{distress}} thee, in particular, Betsey?" [...] <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> blowing his nose, and speaking with unusual tenderness; [...] "if it be in my power to set thy heart at ease on this, or on any other point, name it, and I will give orders to have it immediately performed. Thou hast been a good pious woman, and canst have little to reproach thyself with." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Everything {{was then}} {{carefully}} replaced {{as they had}} found it; and my father at once rode off, with six of the leading tenants--three Protestants and three Catholics--and laid a complaint before the general. The latter professed himself much shocked, and lamented the impossibility of keeping strict discipline among the various regiments stationed in the towns. However, he went down with them at once to the barracks of the regiment, ordered them to be formed up, and <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> if he could identify the culprits.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> but he {{will not}} answer me," [...] Chebron said thoughtfully. [...] "I think {{sometimes}} that it is because I have asked these questions {{that he does not}} wish me to become a high priest. I did not mean anything disrespectful to the gods. But somehow when I want to know things, and he will not answer me, I think he looks sadly, as if he was sorry at heart that he could not tell me what I want to know." ...|$|E
60|$|ANABEL. Your <b>father</b> <b>asked</b> me. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> {{was already}} giving her some lessons.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That you may rely on,' said John. 'I wish I {{could help}} you; {{but there were}} many things at Barbuda that seemed so like fancies of my own, that I could not <b>ask</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> to pay for them, and I have not much at my {{disposal}} just now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I'm {{going to}} <b>ask</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{to buy a}} ranch near here, where mother can have more of the comforts of life, and where we can all live {{together}} till Wayland is able to stand city life again. Then, if {{you want him to}} go East, I will go with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|My mother <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{what the}} men with the sticks were doing--for, you know, many animals can {{talk to each other}} in their own way, even if they are of {{different}} kinds. He told her that they were protecting the wheat to prevent us from eating it, to which she answered angrily that hares must live somehow, especially when they had young ones to nurse. My father replied that men did not seem to think so, and perhaps they had young ones also. I see now that my father was a philosophic hare. But are you tired of my story? ...|$|E
6000|$|Resolved not to {{be caught}} a second time in such a humiliating {{position}} by a Democrat, I <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> that night what the Tariff was. But I {{was too young to}} understand it, he said. I was to take his word for it that the country would go to the dogs if the Democrats got in and the Tariff were taken away. Here, in a nutshell, though neither he nor I realized it, was the political instruction of the marching hordes. Theirs not to reason why. I was too young, they too ignorant. Such is the method of Authority! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then that's settled,' said Psmith. 'I {{knew you}} would not desert me in my hour of need, Comrade Jackson. [...] "What will you do," [...] <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> alarmed for my safety, [...] "among these wild undergraduates? I fear for my Rupert." [...] "Have no fear, father," [...] I replied. [...] "Comrade Jackson will be beside me." [...] His face brightened immediately. [...] "Comrade Jackson," [...] he said, [...] "is a man in whom I have the supremest confidence. If he is with you I shall sleep easy of nights." [...] It was after that that the {{conversation}} drifted {{to the subject of}} agents.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in the least, uncle. I {{dare not}} <b>ask</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> any {{questions}} about his duty, for he thinks {{it is not a}} woman's business; and all I can say is, that we are to sail as soon as the wind will permit, and that we are to be absent a month." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{time came}} for the two Balliol men to take their leave. Norman May had been sitting very silent all the evening, and Meta, who was near him, {{respected}} his mood. When he said good-night, he drew Ethel outside the door. [...] "Ethel," [...] he said, [...] "only one thing: do <b>ask</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> not {{to put on his}} spectacles to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "His steward came but brief while since," [...] {{said the}} Jewess, [...] "panting with haste, to <b>ask</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> for certain monies, {{the price of}} wool the growth of Cedric's flocks, and from him I learned that Cedric and Athelstane of Coningsburgh had left Prince John's lodging in high displeasure, and were about to set forth on their return homeward." ...|$|R
