5|$|During {{his service}} at headquarters, Hitler pursued his artwork, drawing {{cartoons}} <b>and</b> <b>instructions</b> for an army newspaper. During the Battle of the Somme in October 1916, {{he was wounded}} in the left thigh when a shell exploded in the dispatch runners' dugout. Hitler spent almost two months in hospital at Beelitz, returning to his regiment on 5 March 1917. On 15 October 1918, he was temporarily blinded in a mustard gas attack and was hospitalised in Pasewalk. While there, Hitler learned of Germany's defeat, and—by his own account—upon receiving this news, he suffered a second bout of blindness.|$|E

However, the arrival off Porto Ferrajo on 1 August of a powerful British squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren in HMS Renown, whose ship chased Bravoure and Succès as far as Leghorn and reopened the sea passage into the port, almost immediately frustrated Watrin's ambitions. At the same time, a small British force under Captain Gordon landed at Porto Ferrajo to augment the Tuscan garrison.|$|E

40|$|Evaluation <b>and</b> <b>Instruction</b> play very {{important}} roles in curriculum implementation. As a result, the two concepts are often enshrined in the curriculum document. This article therefore examined the Visual Arts curriculum and its relationship with evaluation <b>and</b> <b>instruction.</b> Furthermore, the roles of Evaluation <b>and</b> <b>Instruction</b> in curriculum planning and implementation were investigated. The article was approached as follows: Overview of curriculum; Overview of Art Education and the Visual Arts curriculum; Evaluation; Instruction; and Relationship between curriculum, <b>instruction</b> <b>and</b> evaluation. It was revealed that curriculum, evaluation <b>and</b> <b>instruction</b> are inextricably linked. That, while the Visual Arts curriculum is planned by the curricularist, instruction is what the Visual Arts teacher plans to realize the curriculum; that, evaluation is an enterprise {{carried out by the}} teacher at the implementation level.

5|$|A {{major element}} of {{gameplay}} is the optional discovery and collection of manuscript pages from Alan Wake's latest novel—Departure. Although Wake does not remember writing this book, its storyline {{seems to be}} becoming real around him. These readable manuscript pages are scattered around the game world, out of chronological order; they often describe scenes {{that have yet to}} occur and act as warning <b>and</b> <b>instructions</b> for proceeding through upcoming challenges. Other optional collectibles include coffee thermoses scattered around the game world (100 in all), as well as discovering television sets which show different episodes of the fictional Night Springs series, radios airing talk and music from Bright Falls' local radio station, and textual signs around the town. The radio shows and signs provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} town's history and culture. The game's downloadable content episodes introduce other collectibles such as alarm clocks.|$|E

5|$|On May 23, 2000, {{in a live}} radio {{interview}} on KROQ-FM (Los Angeles), Billy Corgan announced the band's decision to break {{up at the end}} of that year following additional touring and recording.

Only twenty-five copies were cut, each of which was hand numbered and given to friends of the band along with band members themselves. The album, released under the Constantinople Records label created by Corgan, consisted of one double LP and three ten-inch EPs. Originally, the band asked Virgin to offer Machina II as a free download to anyone who bought Machina. When the record label declined, Corgan opted to release the material independently.|$|E

5|$|The Story of Sinuhe, {{written in}} Middle Egyptian, {{might be the}} classic of Egyptian literature. Also written at this time was the Westcar Papyrus, a set of stories told to Khufu by his sons {{relating}} the marvels performed by priests. The Instruction of Amenemope is considered a masterpiece of near-eastern literature. Towards {{the end of the}} New Kingdom, the vernacular language was more often employed to write popular pieces like the Story of Wenamun and the Instruction of Any. The former {{tells the story of a}} noble who is robbed on his way to buy cedar from Lebanon and of his struggle to return to Egypt. From about 700BC, narrative stories <b>and</b> <b>instructions,</b> such as the popular Instructions of Onchsheshonqy, as well as personal and business documents were written in the demotic script and phase of Egyptian. Many stories written in demotic during the Greco-Roman period were set in previous historical eras, when Egypt was an independent nation ruled by great pharaohs such as Ramesses II.|$|E
5|$|In June 1460 {{the exiled}} Yorkists {{successfully}} invaded England, and on 10 July they defeated a royal army at the Battle of Northampton, and captured the king. As a result, Clifford was now ordered to surrender Penrith castle and Honour {{back to the}} earl of Salisbury. But although the now-Yorkist government repeatedly sent messages, orders <b>and</b> <b>instructions</b> to Clifford in the north, he did not acknowledge them, and with Northumberland and Lord Roos, remained in control {{of most of the}} region. In October 1460, the duke of York claimed the throne, and a parliament was summoned to discuss this. The result of its deliberations was the Act of Accord, which disinherited the Prince of Wales in favour of York and his heirs. This, it has been said, was 'repugnant' to Clifford and his colleagues and strengthened their support for the queen. It seems that, although Clifford was summoned to attend, he stayed away, and probably met with Queen Margaret in Kingston upon Hull, where she was gathering Lancastrian lords and their retainers to her. Together, they had soon gathered a fighting force of thousands. Clifford was one of these lords who was subsequently accused of 'systematically' pillaging and looting the Yorkshire estates and tenants of York and Salisbury. In response to these attacks, York, Salisbury, and the latter's son Thomas led an army to the north. Encamped at York's castle at Sandal, on 30 December 1460, the two armies met at the Battle of Wakefield, where Clifford commanded one of the wings of the Lancastrian army. The Yorkist army was routed, and all three Yorkist lords were killed. Clifford was knighted by the Lancastrian commander, Henry Beaufort, Duke of Somerset prior to the battle commencing.|$|E
5|$|The Governor didn't {{have the}} right to make or suspend any laws, unless in cases of urgent necessity, he could do it with the consent of the Governor-General of India. He didn't have the power of {{creating}} a new office, or granting any salary, gratuity, or allowance, without the sanction of the Governor-General of India. The Governor-General had full power to superintend and control the Governor in all points relating to the civil or military administration of the Presidency, and the Governor had to obey the orders <b>and</b> <b>instructions</b> of the Governor-General in all cases. The Governors could propose to the Governor-General drafts of any laws which they thought expedient, together with their reasons for the same; and the Governor-General communicated the resolutions to the Governor, after considering the reasons. The Governors regularly transmitted to the Governor-General true copies of all orders and acts of their governments, and also advice of all matters which they felt to be communicated to the Governor-General. The powers of the Governors were not suspended when the Governor-General visited the Presidency. The departure of the Governor from India with intent to return to Europe was deemed to be a resignation from his office. Alternately, the Governor could resign by declaring it in writing and delivering it to the secretary for the public department of the Presidency.|$|E
