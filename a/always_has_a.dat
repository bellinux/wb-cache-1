5|$|The headdress is {{a variant}} of the {{truncated}} or bee-hive hennin, then fashionable at the Burgundian court. A very similar style, with no tail, is seen on the older of two girls in the donor panels of Presentation of Christ by the Master of the Prado Adoration of the Magi, a pupil of Rogier van der Weyden. The black band under the chin is rarely found in other images from the period, and has been interpreted as a style borrowed from the male chaperon hat, which <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> long tailing tail or cornette, sometimes worn wrapped under the chin in this way.|$|E
5|$|At any size, a meat ant nest <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> {{possibility}} of dying out in any year, but the site may be reoccupied by another colony. Hence, nests {{can be very}} old as suggested in one study. Some nests may never be reoccupied for unknown reasons. The regrowth of vegetation which shades the nest, soil damage or even a disease may wipe out a colony and leave the nest site completely abandoned. The death of a colony may be obvious when competing colonies increase in population and size by expanding their territories with well-established satellite nests in order exploit the food sources once used by a former colony. Satellite nests may diverge from their parent nests to become independent, {{as suggested by the}} antagonism of worker ants from different nests or when others are uninhabitable by insecticide treatment. After the eradication of a nest, satellite nests emerge nearby, and may sever their connections with the parent nest. The separation of a satellite nest is an effective way for a nest to exploit food sources, and a colony with less than 11 entrance holes is recognised as non-mature (a nest is mature at 12). As most satellite nests have 11 holes and accept a queen of their own, a satellite nest may easily develop maturity in one year.|$|E

40|$|Cubicoids (degree 3 surfaces) <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{parameterization}} in tenos {{of rational}} functions, (a polynomial divided by another). On {{the other hand}} cubics (degree 3 plane curves) do not <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> rational parameterization.

[n this paper we describe algorithms to obtain rational and special parametric equations for the cubics and cubicoids. given the impli-cit equations.

25|$|The {{presence}} of a prefix for certain verbs: padìrbti – {{to work for a}} certain amount of time, pašaũkti – to call, nukrìsti – to fall. There are very few perfective prefixed verbs that would distinguish themselves from their imperfective unprefixed counterparts only by their perfective meaning, since any prefix almost <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> semantical nuance.|$|E

25|$|The {{acquisition}} of non-manual features follows an interesting pattern: When {{a word that}} <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> particular non-manual feature associated with it (such as a wh- question word) is learned, the non-manual aspects {{are attached to the}} word but don’t have the flexibility associated with adult use. At a certain point, the non-manual features are dropped and the word is produced with no facial expression. After a few months, the non-manuals reappear, this time being used the way adult signers would use them.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{chirality}} {{of their}} component amino acids, all strands exhibit right-handed twist evident in most higher-order β-sheet structures. In particular, the linking loop between two parallel strands almost <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> right-handed crossover chirality, which is strongly {{favored by the}} inherent twist of the sheet. This linking loop frequently contains a helical region, in which case it is called a β-α-β motif. A closely related motif called a β-α-β-α motif forms the basic component {{of the most commonly}} observed protein tertiary structure, the TIM barrel.|$|E

A field in this style is usually outdoors and almost <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> theme. Urban concept fields are often seen filled with cars, buildings, and other elements that {{are found in the}} city, though some concept field creators go all out and put together themes that may seem a bit over the top to those who aren't familiar with the sport.|$|E

He rides the shining dwarf-made boar Gullinbursti and possesses the ship Skíðblaðnir which <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> favorable breeze and can be folded together and carried in a pouch when it is not being used.

25|$|Typically a coppiced {{woodland}} is {{harvested in}} sections or coups on a rotation. In this way, a crop is available each year {{somewhere in the}} woodland. Coppicing {{has the effect of}} providing a rich variety of habitats, as the woodland <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> range of different-aged coppice growing in it, which is beneficial for biodiversity. The cycle length depends upon the species cut, the local custom, and the use to which the product is put. Birch can be coppiced for faggots on a three- or four-year cycle, whereas oak can be coppiced over a fifty-year cycle for poles or firewood.|$|E

500|$|Nicolas Giffard summarises {{the modern}} {{assessment}} of the Budapest Gambit: an old opening, seldom used by champions without having fallen in disgrace. While White has several methods to get a small advantage, this defence is strategically sound. Black gets a good pawn structure and possibilities of attack on the kingside. His problems generally come from the white pressure on the d-column {{and a lack of}} space to manoeuvre his pieces. Boris Avrukh writes, [...] "The Budapest Gambit is almost a respectable opening; I doubt there is a refutation. Even in the lines where White manages to keep an extra pawn, Black <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> lot of play for it." ...|$|E

Typically, the rhythmic patterns played on the percussion are rather complicated, often with several different patterns played simultaneously. The clave rhythm is an important element that forms the basis of salsa. Apart from percussion, a variety of melodic instruments are commonly used as accompaniment, such as a guitar, trumpets, trombones, the piano, and many others, all depending on the performing artists. Bands are typically divided into horn and rhythm sections, led by one or more singers (soneros or salseros) [...]|$|E
