40|$|The anodic {{electrochemical}} {{behavior of}} the water vapor electrolysis cell was investigated. A theoretical review of various aspects of cell overvoltage is presented with special emphasis on concentration overvoltage and <b>activation</b> <b>overvoltage.</b> Other sources of overvoltage are described. The experimental apparatus controlled and measured anode potential and cell current. Potentials between 1. 10 and 2. 60 V (vs NHE) and currents between 0. 1 and 3000 mA were investigated. Different behavior was observed between the standard cell and the free electrolyte cell. The free electrolyte cell followed typical Tafel behavior (i. e. <b>activation</b> <b>overvoltage)</b> with Tafel slopes of about 0. 15, and the exchange current densities of 10 to the minus 9 th power A/sq cm, both in good agreement with literature values. The standard cell exhibitied this same Tafel behavior at lower current densities but deviated toward lower than expected current densities at higher potentials. This behavior and other results were examined to determine their origin...|$|E

This paper details the empirical analysis wh ich yielded the parametr ic coefficients employed in the model. A 28 run exper iment covering a range of operating currents (50 to 300 ASF), temperatures (328 to 358 K), oxygen partial pressures (0. 6 to 3. 1 a tm abs.) and hydrogen partial pressures (2. 0 to 3. 1 a im abs.) was conducted. Parametr ic equations for the <b>activation</b> <b>overvoltage</b> and the internal resistance of the fuel cell were obtained f rom linear regression. The factors to be employed in the linear regression had been previously determined through a mechanist ic analysis of fuel cell processes. <b>Activation</b> <b>overvoltage</b> was mode led {{as a function of}} the operating temperature, the product of operating temperature, and the logarithm of the operating current, and the product of operating temperature and the logarithm of the oxygen concentration at the catalyst reaction sites. The internal resistance of the fuel cell was mode led {{as a function of the}} operating temperature and the current. Correlation of the empirical mode l to exper imental data was very good. It is anticipated that the mechanist ic validity yielded by the coupling of mechanist ic and empirical mode l ing techniques will also al low for accurate predictive capabil-ities outside of the experimental range. A mechanist ic mode l defining the factors most likely to influence fuel cell per fo rmance has been described previ-ously. I' 2 The per formance of a fuel cell (output voltage) was defined as a function of the thermodynamic potential, the <b>activation</b> <b>overvoltage,</b> and the ohmic overvoltage, with mass transport losses being incorporated in each of the three terms V = E + ~ot + ~lohm ~ [1] The thermodynamic potential E was defined via a Nernst equat ion a...|$|E
40|$|A parametr ic mode l {{predicting}} the per formance {{of a solid}} po lymer electrolyte, proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell has been developed using a combinat ion of mechanistic and empirical mode l ing techniques. This paper details the mechanist ic mode l development. Mass transport properties are considered in the mechanist ic deve lopment via Stefan-Maxwel l equations. Thermodynamic equil ibrium potentials are defined using the Nernst equation. <b>Activation</b> <b>overvoltages</b> are defined via a Tafel equation, and internal resistances are defined via the Nernst-P lanck equation, leading to a definition of ohmic overvoltage via an Ohm's law equation. The mechanist ic mode l cannot adequately mode l fuel cell performance, since several simplifying approximat ions {{have been used in}} order to facilitate mode l development. Additionally, certain properties likely to be observed in operational fuel cells, such as thermal gradients, have not been considered. Nonetheless, the insights gained f rom the mechanist ic assessment of fuel cell processes were found to give the resulting empirical mode l a firmer theoretical basis than many of the mode ls presently available in the literature. Correlation of the empirical mode l to actual exper imental data was very good.

Data are presented which strongly indicate that the overvoltage includes an <b>activation</b> <b>overvoltage</b> in addition to that due to concentration polarization. The data are analyzed {{from the point of view}} of rate proces-ses and it is shown that the electrode behavior is given by an equation which allows an evaluation of the exchange current density and the transfer coefficients...|$|E
40|$|Passivation {{phenomena}} {{have been}} observed upon cathodic and anodic polarization of the Al electrode in AlCl 3 -KCl-NaCl melts between 100 and 160 C. They are caused by formation of a solid salt layer at the electrode surface resulting from concentration changes upon current flow. The anodic limiting currents increased with temperature and with decreasing AlCl 3 content of the melt. Current voltage curves obtained on a rotating aluminum disk showed a linear relationship between the anodic limiting current and omega to the minus 1 / 2 power. Upon cathodic polarization, dendrite formation occurs at the Al electrode. The <b>activation</b> <b>overvoltage</b> in AlCl 3 -KCl-NaCl was determined by galvanostatic current step methods.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} the contact surface structure of porous Si-based membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) on the performance of microfuel cells, because the contact area of the triple-phase boundary among the MEA components {{plays an important role in}} the performance of polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). An n-type silicon substrate was first wet-etched with KOH and subsequently anodically etched to fabricate a porous Si substrate. The cross section of the mechanically polished Si wafer showed pores with high aspect ratios. Electrolyte solutions were filled into the pores to prepare a porous Si membrane (PSM), and the MEA was fabricated by hot-pressing the PSM between two conventional catalyst-coated carbon-paper electrodes. The porous Si-based MEA worked well and showed a power density higher than that of the Nafion®- 212 -based membrane. Further, we examined {{the effects of the}} nano/microstructures at the triple-phase boundary and found that the more densely arranged nano/microstructures reduced the magnitudes of the <b>activation</b> <b>overvoltage</b> and ohmic overvoltage, thereby improving the cell performance...|$|E
40|$|The total {{electric}} potential difference between a metal and a solution across an oxide film being bui lt up by a constant anodic current is decomposed into three contributions: differences at the interphases metal-oxide and oxide-solu-tion, both subject o <b>activation</b> <b>overvoltage,</b> and the difference across the oxide layer. For {{one or the other}} of the interphases the case of l inearity of overvolt-age with the logarithm of the current (in the range of large currents) and that of proportionality of overvoltage with current (in the range of small currents) are examined in some detail, and previously obtained experimental data for three types of t itanium, for hafnium, and for tantalum are analyzed in terms of the proposed theoretical treatment. Numerical values are obtained for the various parameters appearing in the equations: thickness of the interphase, exchange current, {{electric potential}} difference, and electric field at zero current.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{detailed}} {{model of a}} solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) tube is presented. The SOFC tube is discretized along its longitudinal axis. Detailed models of the kinetics of the shift and reforming reactions are introduced in order to evaluate their rates along the SOFC axis. Energy, moles, and mass balances are performed for each slice of the components under investigation, allowing the calculation of temperature profiles. Friction factors and heat-exchange coefficients are calculated by means of experimental correlations. As for the SOFC overvoltages, the <b>activation</b> <b>overvoltage</b> is calculated using the Butler-Volmer equation and semiempirical correlations for the exchange current density, Ohmic losses are evaluated introducing an appropriate electrical scheme and material resistivities, and concentration overvoltage is calculated by means of both binary and Knudsen diffusion coefficients. On {{the basis of this}} model, a case study is presented and discussed, in which temperatures, pressures, chemical compositions, and electrical parameters are evaluated for each slice of the SOFC tube under investigation. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed, in order to investigate the influence of the design parameters on the performance of the system...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The heavy {{hydrogen}} isotopes, deuterium (D) and tritium (T) are important {{materials in the}} field of nuclear energy. Particularly in recent years, development of new effective separation method is required for the water contaminated by the T. Every day the enormous volume is accumulating in Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. The water electrolysis, which is the industrially most general separation method, has disadvantage that consume energy is tremendous. To solve this point, we have investigated novel hydrogen isotope separation system named Combined Electrolysis Fuel Cell (CEFC) [1]. In this system, hydrogen and oxygen produced by electrolysis is used for power generation in fuel cell. From this, we can save energy and get further isotope effect by electrochemical reaction in fuel cell. Actually we reported that the D isotope was enriched in water phase by fuel cells with anion or cation conducting polymer [2, 3]. Here, we newly focused on another type of fuel cell, Alkaline Fuel Cell (AFC), and investigated the separation mechanism by several electrochemical methods. Experimental The anode was Ru catalyst supported by carbon and the cathode was Pt one. The electrolyte was 30 wt. % KOH solution. Pure H 2 ­­ or D 2 gas was supplied to anode and air was did to cathode. The reference electrode was Hg/HgO. Linear sweep amperometry was measured at the scan rate of 20 mA/sec until the cell voltage reached 0. 4 V. Simultaneously electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out by frequency analyzer. The frequency range was from 0. 1 Hz to 1 x 104 Hz. The experimental temperature was 50 ºC. 3 ．Results Figure 1 shows the cell voltage-current curves of AFC. The same values of cell voltage at 0 A did not clearly demonstrate that the equilibrium potential of hydrogen oxidation reaction depended on the isotopes. The <b>activation</b> <b>overvoltage,</b> which can be detected as the voltage drop when the current was applied, was about 0. 2 V for both gases. On the one hand, the cell voltage decreased linearly until the current reached 1400 mA when H 2 gas was used. On the other hand, the voltage of D 2 result was remarkably fallen at 1160 mA. The difference of the cell voltage was mainly attributed to the anode potential. This result suggested that the H 2 gas transportation in the gas diffusion layer was faster than that of D 2 probably. In the meeting, we report the separation factor of the D in a ddition to the EIS results...|$|E
