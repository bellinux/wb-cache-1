5|$|For a {{short time}} during his playing days with the Giants, Bonds {{temporarily}} changed his demeanor {{at the behest of}} a group of teammates, resulting in him smiling much more frequently and engaging more with others with a pleasant demeanor. Shortly thereafter, {{in the midst of a}} slump, the same group of teammates pleaded that he revert, having seemingly lost his competitive edge, and causing the team lose more.

William Smith and James McGill later moved to Indianapolis in 1913 after purchasing the Indianapolis Baseball Club for $150,000. George Smith, the 1916 Kentucky Derby winner, was named after Pittsburgh Phil because he had once owned the colt's dam, Consuelo II.

5|$|Although {{romantic love}} was not discouraged, marriages were {{arranged}} as agreements <b>and</b> <b>bonds</b> formed between two clans (with property {{as the chief}} concern), not necessarily two individuals.

However, she retained her natal surname. The vast majority of people during Han practiced monogamy, although wealthy officials and nobles could afford to support one or many concubines in addition to their legal wife.|$|E
5|$|Grant's {{second term}} saw renewed {{economic}} turmoil. In September 1873, Jay Cooke & Company, a New York brokerage house, collapsed after {{it failed to}} sell all of the bonds issued by Jay Cooke's Northern Pacific Railway. The collapse rippled through Wall Street, and other banks and brokerages that owned railroad stocks <b>and</b> <b>bonds</b> were also ruined. On September 20, the New York Stock Exchange suspended trading for ten days. Grant, who knew little about finance, traveled to New York to consult leading businessmen and bankers for {{advice on how to}} resolve the crisis, which became known as the Panic of 1873. Grant believed that, as {{with the collapse of the}} Gold Ring in 1869, the panic was merely an economic fluctuation that affected bankers and brokers. He instructed the Treasury to buy $10 million in government bonds, injecting cash into the system. The purchases curbed the panic on Wall Street but an industrial depression, later called the Long Depression, nonetheless swept the nation. Many of the nation's railroads—89 out of 364—went bankrupt.|$|E

Through continued work and re-investment of profits, it survived the Great Depression and became increasingly successful during the late 1930s and early 1940s. By 1943, Kimball's initial $150 investment in the agency was worth nearly $100,000.|$|E

5|$|Ruth set the Major League Baseball single-season {{home run}} record four times, first at 29 (1919), then 54 (1920), 59 (1921), and finally 60 (1927). Ruth's 1920 and 1921 seasons are {{tied for the}} widest margin of victory for a home run {{champion}} as he topped the next highest total by 35 home runs in each season. The single season mark of 60 stood for 34 years until Roger Maris hit 61 home runs in 1961. Maris' mark was broken 37 years later by both Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa during the 1998 home run record chase, with McGwire ultimately setting the mark at 70. Barry Bonds, who also has the most career home runs, set the current single season record of 73 in 2001. The 1998 and 2001 seasons each had 4 players hit 50 or more home runs – Greg Vaughn, Ken Griffey, Jr., Sosa, and McGwire in 1998 and Alex Rodriguez, Luis Gonzalez, Sosa, <b>and</b> <b>Bonds</b> in 2001.

METHODS: 180 specimens {{were made of}} Duralay and randomly divided into 6 groups (n = 30) according to surface treatment <b>and</b> <b>bonding</b> material: G 1 - surface roughening with Soflex <b>and</b> <b>bonding</b> with Duralay; G 2 - roughening with aluminum oxide blasting <b>and</b> <b>bonding</b> with Duralay; G 3 - application of monomer <b>and</b> <b>bonding</b> with Duralay; G 4 - roughening with Soflex <b>and</b> <b>bonding</b> with Transbond XT; G 5 - roughening with aluminum oxide blasting <b>and</b> <b>bonding</b> with Transbond XT and G 6 : application of monomer <b>and</b> <b>bonding</b> with Transbond. The results were statistically assessed by ANOVA/Games-Howell. RESULTS: The means (MPa) were: G 1 = 18. 04, G 2 = 22. 64, G 3 = 22. 4, G 4 = 9. 71, G 5 = 11. 23, G 6 = 9. 67. The Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI) ranged between 2 and 3 on G 1, G 2 and G 3 whereas in G 4, G 5 and G 6 it ranged from 0 to 1, showing that only the material affects the pattern of adhesive flaw. CONCLUSION: The surface treatment and the material influenced adhesive resistance of brackets bonded to temporary crowns. Roughening by aluminum blasting increased bond strength when compared to Soflex, in the group bonded with Duralay. The bond strength of Duralay acrylic resin was superior to that of Transbond XT composite resin...|$|R
