To contrast the speed of Reign in Blood, the band consciously decided {{to slow down the}} tempos, and incorporate more melodic singing. According to Hanneman, [...] "We knew we couldn't top Reign in Blood, so we had to slow down.

So I started to write about that and it turned into the Hockey Sweater story." ...|$|E

500|$|To {{prevent any}} of the {{material}} from leaking onto the Internet, West made the recording of the album as secretive as he could; he instituted a [...] "No tweeting, no talking, no e-mailing" [...] rule for others at the sessions to abide by. Pusha T recalled West's attitude in an interview for Rolling Stone, saying that [...] "then there {{happened to be a}} leak, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> Kanye ranting and raving, like, 'Fuck this!

500|$|The flag {{being so}} very large, mother {{was obliged to}} obtain {{permission}} from the proprietors of Claggetts [...] brewery which was in our neighborhood, to spread it out in their malt house; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> seeing my mother down on the floor, placing the stars: {{after the completion of}} the flag, she superintended the topping of it, having it fastened in the most secure manner to prevent its being torn away by (cannon) balls: the wisdom of her precaution was shown during the engagement: many shots piercing it, but it still remained firm to the staff. Your father (Col. Armistead) declared that no one but the maker of the flag should mend it, and requested that the rents should merely be bound around.|$|E
500|$|... "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" [...] {{features}} guest appearances {{from several}} actors and actresses, including Rosemarie DeWitt (as Midge) and Maggie Siff (as Rachel Menken). DeWitt {{was given a}} recurring role in the season as Don's mistress, which lasted for six episodes. She initially felt out of place while playing out her character. DeWitt stated, [...] "They were {{at the end of}} casting, and hadn't found the right Midge yet. Originally they had a scene where she opens the door wearing a red kimono, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> thinking 'I'm not that', so I wasn’t sure I was right for the part.

[...] "It was 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> I was so freaked out by the script that I went upstairs to our guest bedroom where my wife was sick with the flu and I got into bed with her," [...] recalled Korman. [...] "I called Jen and said: 'I'm telling you, this script is remarkable. I've never read a pilot like this, and for a guy who has never written a procedural show in his life, he's actually making two cases work". Initially, Salke and Korman looked to sell acquisition rights to Fox.|$|E

So when I was doing 'Bounce', you know I don't actually drink or smoke so I thought I don't wanna do a video in a club like poppin' bottles and all this stuff, although the song's about partying. I [...] do a celebration... and it made me think of that experience with my mother's friend going to an Indian wedding and having the most crazy and amazing time and I though I wanna do an Indian wedding!

500|$|Britpop {{artists were}} vocal about their disdain for grunge. In a 1993 NME interview, Damon Albarn of Britpop band Blur agreed with {{interviewer}} John Harris' assertion that Blur was an [...] "anti-grunge band", and said, [...] "Well, that's good. If punk was about {{getting rid of}} hippies, then I'm getting rid of grunge". Noel Gallagher of Oasis, while a fan of Nirvana, wrote music that refuted the pessimistic nature of grunge. Gallagher noted in 2006 that the 1994 Oasis single [...] "Live Forever" [...] "was written {{in the middle of}} grunge and all that, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> Nirvana had a tune called 'I Hate Myself and I Want to Die,' and I was like...'Well, I'm not fucking having that.'

500|$|Rodriguez wrote Machete in 1993 {{as a full}} {{feature for}} Danny Trejo. [...] "I had cast him in Desperado <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> thinking, 'Wow, this guy should have his own series of Mexploitation movies like Charles Bronson or like Jean-Claude Van Damme.' So I wrote him this idea of a federale from Mexico who gets hired to do hatchet jobs in the U.S. I had heard {{sometimes}} FBI or DEA have a really tough job that they don't {{want to get their}} own agents killed on, they'll hire an agent from Mexico to come do the job for $25,000. I thought, 'That's Machete. He would come and do a really dangerous job for {{a lot of money to}} him but for everyone else over here it's peanuts.' But I never got around to making it." [...] The trailer was made into a feature film which was released in September 2010; a sequel, Machete Kills (2013), followed.|$|E
500|$|Broderick's moves were choreographed by Kenny Ortega (who later choreographed Dirty Dancing). Much {{of it had}} to be {{scrapped}} {{though as}} Broderick had injured his knee badly during the scenes of running through neighbors' backyards. [...] "I was pretty sore", Broderick said. [...] "I got well enough to do {{what you see in the}} parade there, but I couldn't do most of Kenny Ortega's knee spins and things like that that we had worked on. When we did shoot it, we had all this choreography <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> John would yell with a megaphone, 'Okay, do it again, but don't do any of the choreography,' because he wanted it to be a total mess." [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] was somewhat choreographed but for [...] "Twist and Shout", Broderick said, [...] "we were just making everything up". Hughes explained that much of the scene was spontaneously filmed. [...] "It just happened that this was an actual parade, which we put our float into—unbeknownst to anybody, all the people on the reviewing stand. Nobody knew what it was, including the governor." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first song}} she wrote was [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] {{and in an}} {{interview}} with Faze, she revealed that writing songs in English proved to be challenging for her: [...] "I prayed and asked God to send me a good song today, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> I started writing the song [...] a couple of hours after. I wrote the music and lyrics at the same time, and when that happens it's really magical to me." [...] After completing [...] "Objection (Tango)", Shakira decided to write ten more songs and began setting up portable recording studios in the rural region of Uruguay. She wrote various songs with a [...] "dictionary {{in one hand and a}} thesaurus in the other." [...] During the songwriting process, Shakira wrote [...] "Underneath Your Clothes" [...] as a love song for de la Rúa. She explained that, [...] "If you check the subject of my songs, most of them talk about my own experiences and feelings and what I was actually going through in my life." ...|$|E

I {{just thought it was}} the ultimate sexy show I've ever seen. And I was like, 'I wish I was up there, I wish I could perform that for my man...' So that's what I did for the video." [...] Talking about the video, Nava noted that for the shooting Beyoncé was trying to be [...] "even more risque than she's been in the past". While filming, he further tried to [...] "create and capture a bit of genuine intimacy" [...] between the singer and her husband.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Charles to make a funny [...] "dark-themed" [...] episode, using {{elements}} that were unusual in sitcoms. Sets for the episode were built, and Bobbi Jo Lathan was cast as flight attendant Lucy Merrit and Ernie Sabella was cast as gun salesman Mo Korn, who was described in the script as [...] "overweight, greasy, slow and low-key". The table reading of the episode was held on December 12, 1990. Louis-Dreyfus stated, [...] "I read the script <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> thinking 'we're {{not going to do}} this'." [...] According to Alexander, when she read a scene in which she holds the gun to her head stating [...] "where do you want it Jerry? The Kennedy? [...] The McKinley?" [...] (referencing the assassination of the two American presidents), Louis-Dreyfus turned to Alexander, stating [...] "I'm not doing this." [...] Both Alexander and Cherones, who would direct the episode, felt that the gun content in the story was too provocative. Richards was concerned that his character would be open about arming Elaine, though in a later interview he stated [...] "although, why not? I think Kramer could justify the use of a weapon." ...|$|E
500|$|He left CAI {{at the age}} of 18 {{and began}} a degree in French at the University of Ulster, (formally Ulster Polytechnic) in Jordanstown. He stayed at {{university}} for a year before dropping out. In a 1999 interview, Nesbitt said, [...] "I had the necessary in my head, but I just couldn't be bothered. Being 18 is the worst age to expect people to learn things. There are other things to be bothered with, like girls and football." [...] He made the decision to quit when he was trying to write an overdue essay on existentialism in Les Mains Sales at 4am one day. His father suggested that he should move to England if he wanted to continue acting, so Nesbitt enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama (CSSD), part of University of London. Nesbitt felt lost and misrepresented when he first arrived in London, on account of his Northern Irish background; [...] "When I first came to drama school I was a Paddy the minute I walked in. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> going to drama school and them all saying to me, 'Aww, yeah, Brits out', and I was like 'It's a wee bit more complicated than that, you know.'"

He formally received the accolade at Buckingham Palace on 18 February 2009. Afterwards he said, [...] "You can't ask a fantasy writer not to want a knighthood. You know, for two pins I'd get myself a horse and a sword." [...] In late 2009, he did make himself a sword, {{with the help of his}} friends. He told a Times Higher Education interviewer that [...] "At the end of last year I made my own sword. I dug out the iron ore from a field about 10miles away – I was helped by interested friends. We lugged 80kilos of iron ore, used clay from the garden and straw to make a kiln, and lit the kiln with wildfire by making it with a bow.' Colin Smythe, his long-term friend and agent, donated some pieces of meteoric iron – 'thunderbolt iron' has a special place in magic and we put that in the smelt, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> when we sawed the iron apart it looked like silver. Everything about it I touched, handled and so forth ... And everything was as it should have been, it seemed to me." ...|$|E
500|$|On April 16, 1953 {{against the}} St. Louis Browns (the second {{game of the}} season, and Chicago's home opener) Pierce pitched his second one-hitter, a 1–0 victory in which he allowed only a seventh-inning double by Bobby Young; the White Sox gained only two singles in the contest, and scored on a walk, {{sacrifice}} hit, error and sacrifice fly. Pierce was chosen to start the All-Star Game for the AL – the first White Sox pitcher ever to do so – and allowed only one hit through three innings (a single by Stan Musial). Boston Red Sox star Ted Williams recalled of the game: [...] "It was a hot day at Crosley Field <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> being so concerned for little Billy Pierce of the White Sox. Billy probably threw harder than anybody for a guy his size, he had a real big delivery, nice to look at, and he had overcome a lot. I understand he had had epilepsy, and I was really pulling for him. He was a nervous little guy, {{and here he was}} starting his first All-Star game in a bandbox park that's tough to pitch in, and against Robin Roberts to boot. Pierce held them {{in the palm of his}} hand that day. He threw the ball right by everybody." ...|$|E
500|$|Rowland has {{acknowledged}} {{on several occasions}} that although she loved dance music, it was not really the type of music she would record. While in Europe in 2008, she met Guetta {{at one of his}} DJ shows in Southern France and commented that [...] "Listening to him was just crazy." [...] Guetta was playing the instrumental version of [...] "When Love Takes Over". Recalling that it brought tears to her eyes, Rowland remarked, [...] "I felt so much emotion from the track; something happened the first time I heard it, and it was just beautiful. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> thinking 'Why is this touching me like this?' You know, it was like there was a kinda soul-tie to it!" [...] Upon meeting Guetta, she asked him for the song so she could write its lyrics. [...] "So I met David and asked him for the track... He gave it to me, and I brought it back here to London, UK and wrote the actual song". At a writing session in a London hotel room, Rowland and songwriting duo Nervo wrote the lyrics and melody over Guetta's backing track. Rowland later joined Guetta and Julie Terry Lefèvre-Han in the recording studio to finish off the song.|$|E
