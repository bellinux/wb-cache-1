40|$|INTRODUCTION As {{a result}} of {{separate}} investigations on Panulirus japonicus (sens, lat.), the present authors independently {{came to the conclusion}} that more than one species was included under that name. The first author (George), when in 1958 studying specimens of the Western <b>Australian</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> which at that time was indicated by the name Panulirus longipes (A. Milne Edwards) (a species considered by many authors to be synonymous with P. japonicus), was dissatisfied with that identification and obtained material of the typical P. longipes from Zanzibar. Comparison with this material showed that the Western <b>Australian</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> represented an unnamed species, which he then described as P. cygnus. He also arrived at the conclusion that P. japonicus and P. longipes are separate species and that the latter perhaps should also be split up. The second author (Holthuis), during a year's visit (1952 - 1953) to the U. S. National Museum in Washington, D. C., was struck by the fact that the colour pattern of "Panulirus japonicus" from Hawaii is strikingly different from that of the typical Japanese P. japonicus, a difference that proved to be constant. He also found the colour pattern of P. longipes to be strikingly different from that of the typical P. japonicus, and further discovered constant morphological differences between the three forms, which convinced him that they represented three valid species. These finds were verified later with the collections of the Leiden Museum, where the types of P. japonicus are preserved; it was then decided to make a revision of the entire P. japonicus group. In the meantime E. P. Reed described a new species P. pascuensis from Easter Island, which also proved to belon...|$|E
40|$|A lectin {{detected}} in haemolymph from the <b>Australian</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> Panulirus cygnus agglutinated human ABO Group A cells {{to a higher}} titre than Group O or B. The lectin also agglutinated rat and sheep erythrocytes, with reactivity with rat erythrocytes strongly enhanced by treatment with the proteolytic enzyme papain, an observation consistent with reactivity via a glycolipid. The lectin, purified by affinity chromatography on fixed rat-erythrocyte stroma, was inhibited equally by N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylgalactosamine. Comparison of data from gel filtration of haemolymph (behaving as a 1, 800, 000 Da macromolecule), and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified lectin (a single 67, 000 Da band), suggested that in haemolymph the lecin was a multimer. The purified anti-A lectin autoprecipitated unless the storage solution contained chaotropic inhibitors (125 [*]mmol/L sucrose: 500 [*]mmol/L urea). The properties of this anti-A lectin and other similar lectins are consistent with a role in innate immunity in these invertebrates...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Changes in the {{offshore}} oceanographic processes are suspected {{to be the}} cause of a recent dramatic decline in the settlement of post-larvae of the Western <b>Australian</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> (Panulirus cygnus), which has greatly reduced the productivity from the world’s second-largest spiny lobster fishery. The present study assessed whether there are differences in the nutritional condition of the larvae of P. cygnus sampled from two pairs of cyclonic eddies (CEs) and anticyclonic eddies (AEs). Morphometric and biochemical analyses were undertaken on the mid–late-stage larvae (VI, VII, VIII) sampled offshore from two pairs of adjacent counter-rotating mesoscale eddies in the Leeuwin Current off Western Australia. The results showed that larvae captured from CEs had greater average total dry mass (P, 0. 001) than those from AEs. Stage VIII larvae from CEs contained more protein (P, 0. 008) (38. 5 % 5. 4 s. e.) and lipid (P, 0. 005) (67. 2 % 12. 1) than did those from AEs. The possible causes for these differences are uncertain but may be related to differences in water temperatures in CEs v. AEs influencing the ability of phyllosomas to accumulate nutritional reserves...|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} unique marine {{crustaceans}} in Australian waters. The best-known class, {{to which all}} the edible species of crustacean belong, is Malacostraca. The warm waters of northern Australia are home to many species of decapod crustaceans, including crabs, false crabs, hermit crabs, lobsters, shrimps, and prawns. The peracarids, including the amphipods and isopods, are more diverse in the colder waters of southern Australia. Less-well-known marine groups include the classes Remipedia, Cephalocarida, Branchiopoda, Maxillopoda (which includes the barnacles, copepods and fish lice), and the Ostracoda. Notable species include the Tasmanian giant crab, the second largest crab species in the world, found in deep water, and weighing up to 13kg, and the <b>Australian</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters,</b> such as the western rock lobster, which are distinct from other lobster species as {{they do not have}} claws.|$|R
50|$|Other {{common names}} for the species in the United States include <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> Bermuda <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> common <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> crawfish, Florida <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> West Indian langouste and West Indian <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Panulirus penicillatus is {{a species}} of <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> that lives on shallow rocky and coral reefs in the {{tropical}} Indo-Pacific region.

40|$|The <b>Australian</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> {{fishery is}} Australia's most {{economically}} valuable fishery, presently worth around 450 million per annum (Anon., 2008 a). However, while many are currently well managed, most <b>Australian</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> fisheries {{are at their}} maximum sustainable capacity whilst demand for lobster continues to increase (Jones, 2009 a). Globally, spiny lobster catch rates have stabilised or even declined since 2002 (FAO, 2007; 2009). Furthermore, due to anthropogenic perturbations, wild fishery production may actually drop significantly as highlighted by recent projections for western rock lobster catch and marked decreases in catch per unit effort (CPUE) for may lobster species (Anon., 2008 b; FAO, 2009). The only real potential for significant production growth appears to be through aquaculture. Internationally, lobster aquaculture to date has consisted of capturing juvenile wild seed stock for on-growing to market size (Jones, 2009 b). However, the long-term viability and sustainability of spiny lobster aquaculture depends on closing the life cycle and developing an economically viable method for raising lobsters from eggs through to market size (Grove-Jones et al., 2002). The ornate spiny lobster (Panulirus ornatus) {{has been identified as}} having clear commercial potential, largely due to its abbreviated life history compared to other spiny lobster species (Grove-Jones et al., 2002; George, 2005). More specifically, its relatively short larval phase (4 months) and fast juvenile growth rate make it a suitable candidate for commercial aquaculture if techniques and technologies, to consistently produce large numbers of juveniles from eggs, are developed. A Fisheries Research and Development Corporation (FRDC) commissioned review (Grove-Jones et al., 2002) stated that development of viable puerulus production technology for lobsters would be a 5 + year prospect, which should be addressed through three discrete phases to most effectively achieve the commercialisation of spiny lobsters in Australia (see Chapter II). The experiments carried out as a part of this study address phase I as specified by the Grove-Jones et al. (2002). This work fills important knowledge gaps previously unknown for this species, in brief, the major findings include: 1. The control of breeding, gonad development, moulting and egg extrusion though the photoperiodic and water temperature manipulation. In particular, that the lengthening of photoperiod is the cue to gonad development and breeding for this species. 2. The optimal egg incubation temperature defined for this species and a model to predict the hatch timing and developmental period of embryos when incubated at a range of temperatures. 3. Techniques to quantitatively assess phyllosoma quality at hatch, including the development of a ten minute salinity stress test. 4. Larval husbandry techniques to achieve high growth and survival through to phyllosoma stage V. These findings are important towards the development of hatchery technology and commercialisation for P. ornatus. Ultimately, these findings are fundamental to successful puerulus culture. Results from these studies have made a significant contribution to the culture for P. ornatus within Australia. Furthermore, they have formed the foundation of continuing successful work in the area of rock lobster larval rearing which has resulted in the completion of the larval cycle of Panulirus ornatus in captive culture...|$|E

25|$|<b>Spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> tend {{to live in}} crevices {{of rocks}} and coral reefs, only {{occasionally}} venturing out at night to seek snails, clams, sea-hares, crabs, or sea urchins to eat. Sometimes, they migrate in very large groups in long files of lobsters across the sea floor. These lines {{may be more than}} 50 <b>lobsters</b> long. <b>Spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> navigate using the smell and taste of natural substances in the water that change {{in different parts of the}} ocean. It was recently discovered that <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> can also navigate by detecting the Earth's magnetic field. They keep together by contact, using their long antennae. Potential predators may be deterred from eating <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> by a loud screech made by the antennae of the <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> rubbing against a smooth part of the exoskeleton. <b>Spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> usually exhibit the social habit of being together. However recent studies indicate that healthy lobsters move away from infected ones, leaving the diseased lobsters to fend for themselves.|$|R

5|$|Natural predators of the California <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> include bony fish {{such as the}} California sheephead, giant {{sea bass}} and cabezone, sharks {{including}} the horn shark and leopard shark, octopuses and sea otters. In response to an approaching predator, <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> including the California <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> can produce a loud noise using the stick-slip phenomenon, akin to a bowed instrument. The bases of the antennae act as a plectrum, which is rubbed over a file {{on the edge of}} the antennular plate. If a predator is very close, <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> will flex their muscular tail in order to escape the predator, backwards.|$|R
40|$|<b>Spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> feed on a {{wide range}} of natural marine food. They prey nocturnally upon a diverse {{assemblage}} of epifaunal and infaunal organisms including molluscs (such as snails and clams), smaller crustaceans, echinoderms, polychaetes and algae (Lipicius and Cobb, 1994). Slow moving or sessile benthic marine invertebrates, which serve as main food of most <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> in the wild have also been found useful in culture trials of lobsters. Marine food items are preferred over terrestrial animal food by lobsters and among marine food sources, shellfish (particularly mussels) is preferred over finfish (Booth and Kittaka, 1994). Tropical <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> have several amenable characteristics which make them suitable for aquaculture. Tropical lobsters are adaptable to captive conditions, less cannibalistic and relatively fast growing than their counterparts in the sub-tropical and temperate regions (Anon., 1994). The greatest hurdle in growing <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> is the difficulty in larval rearing and hence the culture of <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> is still not commercially taken up in spite of significant advances made in recent years. However, since <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> mature and breed in captivity and as they can be grown communally; it seems likely that their commercial culture will be possible in the near future (Kittaka and Booth, 1994).

40|$|Abstract. A complex {{nervous system}} enables <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> {{to have a}} rich {{behavioural}} repertoire. The present paper discusses {{the ways in which}} the sensory systems of the Caribbean <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> Panulirus argus, particularly its chemosensory systems, are involved in feeding behaviour. It addresses the neural mechanisms of three aspects of their food-finding ability: detection, identification, and discrimination of natural food odours; the effect of learning on responses to food odours; the mechanisms by which <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> orient to odours from a distance under natural flow conditions. It demonstrates that the olfactory organ of <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> might use acrossneuron response patterns in discriminating odour quality; that the hedonic value of food can be modified by experience, including associative and nonassociative conditioning; that <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> can readily orient to distant odour sources; and that both chemo- and mechanosensory antennular input are important in this behaviour. Either aesthetasc or nonaesthetasc chemosensory pathways can be used in identifying odour quality, mediating learned behaviours, and permitting orientation to the source of distant odours.
