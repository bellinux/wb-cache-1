They are indispens-able for damage control and tissue remodeling on myocardial injury and principal mediators of pathological cardiac remodeling and fibrosis. Despite their manyfold functions, cardiac fibroblasts remain poorly character-ized in molecular terms. Evidence is evolving that cardiac fibroblasts are a heterogeneous population and likely derive from various distinct tissue niches in health and disease. Here, we review our emerging understanding of where cardiac fibroblasts come from, as well <b>as</b> how <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>possibly</b> use this knowledge to develop novel therapies for cardiac fibrosis.

40|$|I {{am pleased}} and excited {{to present the}} {{following}} report {{to you on the}} state of breast cancer in Chicago. The epidemiology of this disease describes an epidemic. This report begins to address the background, the implications and the steps {{that will allow us to}} do better <b>as</b> <b>we</b> battle against it. The researchers in the Sinai Urban Health Institute and their colleagues who have written the papers that follow present several important findings. Notably, far too many women are dying of breast cancer, some for lack of effective treatment and some because of inadequate quality along with less than optimal frequency of mammography. It is not only that the situation is critical and needs to be improved but it is also that the racial disparities in breast cancer mortality are unacceptable and must be eliminated. So we must improve both screening and treatment. Both must be available and both must be <b>as</b> effective <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>possibly</b> make them. In some cases, women cannot afford mammography. In other cases, different programs provide free mammography to those who cannot afford it but then there are no programs to provide the needed treatment if cancer is diagnosed. In still other cases, the quality of the mammogram may be inadequate. Fortunately, this latter situation can be rather well-understood due to benchmark indicators of quality established by the America...|$|R
60|$|Or {{putting the}} thing in a {{slightly}} different phrasing, the New Republican idea amounts to this: the serious aspect of our private lives, the general aspect of all our social and co-operative undertakings, is to prepare as well <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>can</b> a succeeding generation, which shall prepare still more capably for still better generations to follow. We are passing as a race out of a state of affairs when the unconscious building of the future was attained by individualistic self-seeking (altogether unenlightened or enlightened only by the indirect moralizing influence of the patriotic instinct and religion) into a clear consciousness of our co-operative share in that process. That is the essential idea my New Republic would personify and embody. In the past man was made, generation after generation, by forces beyond his knowledge and control. Now a certain number of men are coming to a provisional understanding of some at least of these forces that go to the Making of Man. To some of us there is being given the privilege and responsibility of knowledge. We may plead lack of will or lack of moral impetus, but we can no longer plead ignorance. Just as far as our light upon the general purpose goes, just so far goes our responsibility (whether we respect it or not) to shape and subdue our wills to the Making of Mankind.|$|E

40|$|Closed meanders are planar {{configurations}} {{of one or}} several disjoint closed Jordan curves intersecting a given line or curve transversely. They arise as shooting curves of parabolic PDEs in one space dimension, as trajectories of Cartesian billiards, and as representations of elements of Temperley-Lieb algebras. Given the configuration of intersections, for example as a permutation or an arc collection, the number of Jordan curves is unknown {{and needs to be}} determined. We address this question in the special case of bi-rainbow meanders, which are given as non-branched families (rainbows) of nested arcs. Easily obtainable results for small bi-rainbow meanders containing up to four families suggest an expression of the number of curves by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of polynomials in the sizes of the rainbow families. We prove however, {{that this is not the}} case. In fact, the number of connected components of bi-rainbow meanders with more than four families cannot be expressed as the gcd of polynomials in the sizes of the rainbows. On the other hand, we provide a complexity analysis of nose-retraction algorithms. They determine the number of connected components of arbitrary bi-rainbow meanders in logarithmic time. In fact, the nose-retraction algorithms resemble the Euclidean algorithm, which is used to determine the gcd, in structure and complexity. Looking for a closed formula of the number of connected components, the nose-retraction algorithm is as good as a gcd-formula and therefore <b>as</b> good <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>possibly</b> expect...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} ten months, we have {{designed}} and developed a game for the Microsoft Imagine Cup. This game, built on the Cannibal Engine, was to revolve around the Millennium Development Goals. The obvious goal was to win the Imagine Cup, {{or at least to}} get <b>as</b> far <b>as</b> <b>we</b> could <b>possibly</b> <b>can.</b> Our team consisted of three programmers with little to no game design experience, and {{in the last couple of}} months a 3 D artist helped us with creating the models of the game. In the end, we did not win, nor even made it to the finals, but we were still an experience richer. The design of the game did not go as quickly and as smoothly as expected, but in the end we came up with a design everyone was happy with. It would be a game that did not incorporate the Imagine Cup theme as explicitly as most other entries of the year before, but still would convey the message of the Millennium Development Goals. Set on a distant planet, we also gave ourselves some artistic freedom with the character design, which was necessary because we did not have an artist yet. The main gameplay element of the game would be the ability to travel back in time, whenever for however long you wanted. In the end the mechanic became limited in its use by an energy meter that depletes when you went back in time, and by a five-minute limit of the time you can go back in time. Implementation-wise this mechanic proved to be quite a challenge, especially in combination with an adventure-puzzle-platform game with enemies and other moving and changeable objects. However, with three programmers working almost full-time on it, any problems that arose were dealt with. Having three programmers also meant a sound and solid structure, except when the deadline nears, which is when anything goes, as long as it works. This did not have to happen very often, however. Near the end of the development process, we got the Cannibal Composer from Cannibal Game Studios, to go with their Engine. Using this Composer the world was created, story elements and puzzles were added to the world, and all just in time for the deadline of round 2. Or rather a trifle too late, since the end result could have been that much better, even with just a few hours more. All in all this has been a hard, but challenging and rewarding Bachelor Project, and none of us have regretted our choice of doing this.

60|$|But the Scripture {{alone can}} supply ideas {{answerable}} to {{the majesty of}} this subject. In the Scripture, wherever God is represented as appearing or speaking, everything terrible in nature is called up to heighten the awe and solemnity of the Divine presence. The Psalms, and the prophetical books, are crowded with instances of this kind. The earth shook, (says the Psalmist,) the heavens also dropped at {{the presence of the}} Lord. And what is remarkable, the painting preserves the same character, not only when he is supposed descending to take vengeance upon the wicked, but even when he exerts the like plenitude of power in acts of beneficence to mankind. Tremble, thou earth! at the presence of the Lord; at the presence of the God of Jacob; which turned the rock into standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters! It were endless to enumerate all the passages, both in the sacred and profane writers, which establish the general sentiment of mankind, concerning the inseparable union of a sacred and reverential awe, with our ideas of the divinity. Hence the common maxim, Primus in orbe deos fecit timor. This maxim may be, as I believe it is, false with regard to the origin of religion. The maker of the maxim saw how inseparable these ideas were, without considering that the notion of some great power must be always precedent to our dread of it. But this dread must necessarily follow the idea of such a power, when it is once excited in the mind. It is on this principle that true religion has, and must have, so large a mixture of salutary fear; and that false religions have generally nothing else but fear to support them. Before the Christian religion had, as it were, humanized the idea of the Divinity, and brought it somewhat nearer to us, there was very little said of the love of God. The followers of Plato have something of it, and only something; the other writers of pagan antiquity, whether poets or philosophers, nothing at all. And they who consider with what infinite attention, by what a disregard of every perishable object, through what long habits of piety and contemplation it is that any man is able to attain an entire love and devotion to the Deity, will easily perceive {{that it is not the}} first, the most natural, and the most striking effect which proceeds from that idea. Thus we have traced power through its several gradations unto the highest of all, where our imagination is finally lost; and we find terror, quite throughout the progress, its inseparable companion, and growing along with it, <b>as</b> far <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>possibly</b> trace them. Now, as power is undoubtedly a capital source of the sublime, this will point out evidently from whence its energy is derived, and to what class of ideas we ought to unite it.|$|R
