The series was expected to show the objective of self-sufficiency and recycling throughout and this was represented throughout the house. Inside the house, as housemates entered, they were greeted by a huge wall containing recycled life-sized doors. Behind one of the doors was the Diary Room; a housemate could call to talk to Big Brother in this room {{from the bottom of the}} stairs. Inside the Diary Room was a metallic based chair, layered in slim red padding. Outside of the Diary Room, there was a sweeping staircase leading down to an eco-living room with producers desperate to make the housemates experience 'hell in a hell house'. The living room contained different coloured sofas and chairs and a plasma television. Beside the living room, there was a circular style kitchen for housemates to use. The housemates could store their food items and utensils obtained from the adjacent store room in a purpose-built cow. There was a round table for housemates to sit at and eat together <b>at.</b> <b>Beside</b> the living room, there was a small toilet, and the bedroom. The bedroom was colourful in design this year, and introduced a bike which powered the hair dryers and hair straighteners when active. Both the bedroom and the living area led out into the garden. This series, the garden had a barred prison for any housemates that misbehaved, as well as a treehouse for housemates to get cosy in and it included the returning vegetable patch which was last seen in Big Brother 4. Housemates had to shower outside; with one housemate having to spin a wheel that powered the only shower. The traditional mangle also made its return to the house.

I made Dame Nan teach {{me a few}} words, but I never could remember anything but that [...] "mercy" [...] is [...] "thank ye". However, Merrycourt offered to come with me, and my Lord wished it. Moreover, I thought he might aid in tracing you out. So I saw my Lord alone, and he passed his word to me that, come what would, no one should persuade him to alter his will to do wrong to Berenger's daughter; and so soon as Master Hobbs could get the THROSTLE unladen, and fitted out again, we sailed for Bordeau, {{and there he is}} waiting for us, while Clause and I bought horses and hired a guide, and made our way here on Saturday, where we were very welcome; and the Duchess said she would but wait till she could learn there were no bands of the enemy at hand, to go down with me herself to the place where she had sent the lady. A right worthy dame is this same Duchess, and a stately; and that young King, as they call him, seems hard to please, for he told Berry that his wife's courtliness and ease in his reception were far above aught that he found here. What he means is past a plain man, for as to Berry's wife she is handy, and notable enough, and 'tis well he loves her so well; but what a little brown thing it is, for a man to have gone through such risks for. Nothing to look <b>at</b> <b>beside</b> his mother!' ...|$|E

[...] But I should make to him a just reply: [...] "You do not speak well, Sir, if you think a man in whom there is even a little merit ought to consider danger of life or death, and not rather regard this only, when he does things, whether the things he does are right or wrong and the acts of a good or a bad man. For according to your argument all the demigods would be bad who died at Troy, including the son of Thetis, who so despised danger, in comparison with enduring any disgrace, that when his mother (and she was a goddess) said to him, as he was eager to slay Hector, something like this, I believe,:My son, if you avenge the death of your friend Patroclus and kill Hector, you yourself shall die; for straightway, after Hector, is death appointed unto you. (Hom. Il. 18.96)he, when he heard this, made light of death and danger, and feared much more to live as a coward and not to avenge his friends, and said,:Straightway may I die, after doing vengeance upon the wrongdoer, that I may not stay here, jeered <b>at</b> <b>beside</b> the curved ships, a burden of the earth.|$|E

40|$|A {{study on}} the {{evaluation}} of insecticidal activity of a formulation of in transfluthrin and cyfluthrin insecticide aerosol against lab-bred Aedes aegypti under open and hidden position was conducted. The formulation of aerosol used in this experiment designated as transfluthrin 0. 040 % w/w + cyfluthrin 0. 025 % w/w were commercially sold in the market as ahousehold insecticide product and was tested in a room furnished into similar bedroom condition. The formulation of aerosol was tested against Aedes aegypti based on the accordance of WHO guidelines for efficacy testing of household insecticides product (WHO/HTM/NTDPES/ 2009. 3) and WHO guideline for safe and effective use of household insecticide product (WHOCDS/WHOPES/ 99. 1). Four cages with 10 mosquitoes {{were placed in the}} following positions: one cage at the wall of room (approximately 2 m up from the floor), one cage under the bed, one cage at {{the middle of the floor}} of the cabin room and another one cage <b>at</b> <b>beside</b> of the wardrobe. Ten lab-bred 3 years old sugar-fed Aedes aegypti adult mosquitoes were placed inside the test cages. The test were observed for knockdown at 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes of exposure after applying the aerosol. The mortality rate was determined after 24 hours of holding period. The result showed that the transfluthrin 0. 040 % w/w + cyfluthrin 0. 025 % w/w are more effective among cages which placed in the open area rather than were kept in hidden places and also indicated that longer period of exposure time giving the highest knockdown effect...|$|E
