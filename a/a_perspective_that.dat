5|$|Caprica-Six and Boomer {{are next}} shown conversing with Number Three. While the three move up a stairwell, {{explosives}} {{set by the}} resistance led by Samuel T. Anders (Michael Trucco) detonate, trapping Anders, Three, Boomer, and Caprica-Six in a parking garage. While Anders is originally shielded and hidden by the blast, Caprica-Six breaks her leg. Number Three offers to euthanize her, but Caprica-Six refuses as she suspects that Number Three will {{take the opportunity to}} box her. Shortly afterwards, the three find Anders who Number Three intends to kill before being stopped by Boomer and Caprica-Six. As Number Three goads them, Boomer and Caprica-Six understand that their unique view of humanity through their love for Baltar and Galen Tyrol gives them <b>a</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>that</b> makes them a threat to the Cylon status-quo. When Number Three attempts to kill Anders, she is killed by Caprica-Six who, along with Boomer, allow Anders to escape. Recognizing that it will take some time for Number Three to resurrect and report them, Caprica-Six and Boomer form a pact to change the Cylon perspective of humanity together before finally being rescued from the collapsed parking garage by the other Cylons.|$|E
25|$|Shenhav focuses his multiculturalist program {{mostly on}} around the postcolonialist discourse, but also {{includes}} the postmodernist and feminist ones. For Shenhav, identity is a dynamic, constructivist, random and non-primordial concept, and seeks to deconstruct {{the social and cultural}} constructions (which he sees as basically European) in order develop <b>a</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>that</b> would advance identity politics. Shenhav admits the existence of an asymmetry between the way in which he negates a substantive identity and criticizes the formation of a Hegemonic identity, while encouraging the formation of another substantive identity he wants to liberate within his identity politics. In his opinion, this can be morally justified since an analogy cannot be made between the oppressors and the oppressed and between the rulers and the ruled.|$|E
25|$|Thorstein Veblen {{laid the}} {{foundation}} for the perspective of institutional economics with his criticism of traditional static economic theory. As much as Veblen was an economist, he was also a sociologist who rejected his contemporaries who looked at the economy as an autonomous, stable, and static entity. Veblen disagreed with his peers, as he strongly believed that the economy was significantly embedded in social institutions. Rather than separating economics from the social sciences, Veblen viewed the relationships between the economy and social and cultural phenomena. Generally speaking, the study of institutional economics viewed economic institutions as the broader process of cultural development. While economic institutionalism never transformed into a major school of economic thought, it allowed economists to explore economic problems from <b>a</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>that</b> incorporated social and cultural phenomena. It also allowed economists to view the economy as an evolving entity of bounded rationale.|$|E

500|$|Born in 1946, Michael Aquino was a {{military}} intelligence officer specialising in psychological warfare. In 1969 he joined Anton LaVey's Church of Satan and rose rapidly through the group's ranks. In 1970, while he was serving with the U.S. military during the Vietnam War, Aquino was stationed in Bến Cát in South Vietnam when he authored a tract entitled [...] "Diabolicon" [...] in which he reflected upon his growing divergence from the Church of Satan's doctrines. In this tract, teachings about {{the creation of the}} world, God, and humanity are presented, as is the dualistic idea that Satan complements God. The character of Lucifer is presented as bringing insight to human society, <b>a</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>that</b> was inherited from the depiction of Lucifer in John Milton's seventeenth-century epic poem Paradise Lost.|$|E

500|$|In mid-2004, the newspaper's then-public editor Daniel Okrent, {{wrote an}} opinion piece {{in which he}} said that The New York Times did have a liberal bias in news {{coverage}} of certain social issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage. He stated that this bias reflected the paper's cosmopolitanism, which arose naturally from its roots as a hometown paper of New York City. He wrote, [...] "if you're examining the paper's coverage of these subjects from <b>a</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>that</b> is neither urban nor Northeastern nor culturally seen-it-all; if you are among the groups The Times treats as strange objects to be examined on a laboratory slide (devout Catholics, gun owners, Orthodox Jews, Texans); if your value system wouldn't wear well on a composite New York Times journalist, then a walk through this paper can make you feel you're traveling in a strange and forbidding world." [...] Okrent wrote that the Times Arts & Leisure; the Sunday Times Magazine, and Culture coverage trend to the left.|$|E
500|$|A second {{influence}} on Durkheim's view of society beyond Comte's positivism was the epistemological outlook called social realism. Although he never explicitly exposed it, Durkheim adopted a realist perspective {{in order to}} demonstrate the existence of social realities outside the individual and to show that these realities existed {{in the form of}} the objective relations of society. As an epistemology of science, realism can be defined as <b>a</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>that</b> takes as its central point of departure the view that external social realities exist in the outer world and that these realities are independent of the individual's perception of them. This view opposes other predominant philosophical perspectives such as empiricism and positivism. Empiricists such as David Hume had argued that all realities in the outside world are products of human sense perception. According to empiricists, all realities are thus merely perceived: they do not exist independently of our perceptions, and have no causal power in themselves. Comte's positivism went a step further by claiming that scientific laws could be deduced from empirical observations. Going beyond this, Durkheim claimed that sociology would not only discover [...] "apparent" [...] laws, but would be able to discover the inherent nature of society.|$|E
500|$|The novel, {{originally}} {{conceived by}} Döblin as a novel in [...] "Kino-Stil" [...] ("cinematic style"), {{is characterized by}} rapid shifts of perspective and the increasingly sophisticated use of montage. Döblin, having emphatically rejected the psychological novel in his 1913 essay [...] "To novel writers and their critics," [...] presents the reader of Wadzek with a depiction of characters from <b>a</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>that,</b> rather than offering psychological motivations for their actions, opts for a [...] "psychiatric method" [...] that records events and processes without commenting on them or attempting to explain them. Condemned by contemporary critics for its overly-detailed and grotesque descriptive language, the novel's style has since received acknowledgment for its [...] "radical naturalism". Describing the narrative technique used in Wadzek, the critic Judith Ryan has written, [...] Döblin's refusal to make Wadzek a tragic figure, {{as well as the}} novel's thematization and satire of tragedy, earned the praise of a young Bertolt Brecht, who declared, [...] "Ich liebe das Buch." [...] Other themes of the novel include monopoly capitalism, modern technology, the bourgeois family, and the modern metropolis. Certain aspects of the plot, such as Schneemann's dislike of Stettin (Szczecin) and Wadzek's elopement for America, recapitulate elements of Döblin's own biography.|$|E

500|$|Williams {{has stated}} that the game's events are open to interpretation. Many {{different}} theories have been discussed by the development staff. Davis described the game's pacing as [...] "deliberate", {{but he added that}} there are moments where the pacing slows down significantly and allows the player {{to learn more about the}} game's story through inspecting environmental objects. The city of Dubai is filled with graffiti, which is used to give players information regarding the factions and the backstory. According to Yager, the graffiti was designed to give players <b>a</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>that</b> is different from the main game, and to help make the location more realistic. The team also hoped to make players feel lost when playing the game. As a result, the team added hallucination to the game. The team hoped that by using hallucination as a plot device, they could create a snowball effect and engage players more fully in the story as they complete the game. These hallucinations sometimes occur through the subtext, in which players may not realize their presence. Williams added that having subtext is important, and that the [...] "best stories are the ones that have stuff hidden in them". The game fades to black when the game transitions from one scene to another, and it fades to white when Walker is hallucinating or otherwise deceiving himself.|$|E
500|$|The arch is only {{a prelude}} to the complex {{divisions}} beyond. The space inhabited by the Holy Family is holy ground. Mary, Joseph, the Christ child and the four surrounding angels occupy a space partitioned in the front by the archway and by the wall at the rear. A semicircle of figures is positioned around Christ, echoed in the semicircle of rocks placed directly inside the doorsill. Mary and Joseph are echoed by the colorful vertical porphyry columns on the sides, and by the statues of Adam and Eve. The rear of the shed where the four men stand, the small valley with the shepherds, the town, and the background landscape are also spatially discrete areas, which create a [...] "steady, measured movement into space {{in place of the}} more abrupt jumping from foreground to distant background common to Flemish painting." [...] They also function to surround the Holy Family while simultaneously preventing its isolation from the world. Ainsworth writes that the [...] "message of the painting quietly emerges from the strict, perspectively correct space constructed to engage the viewer." [...] Upton agrees, explaining that the use of geometric devices emphasize the focal point, which [...] "falls well below the horizon in the exact center of the panel", <b>a</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>that</b> would have given the 15th center viewer, kneeling in front of the panel, a [...] "sense of physical relationship between the actual and ideal act of worship." ...|$|E
500|$|Besides Nosaka's {{regimen of}} {{psychological}} indoctrination, {{there were several}} reasons that Japanese POWs chose to join the Chinese communists. Communist guerrillas took care to develop an early rapport with their prisoners by treating them well. Captured Japanese soldiers were generally moved when they learned of the terrible conditions the war inflicted on the Chinese people, <b>a</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>that</b> {{they had not been}} exposed to before their capture. Closer to the end of [...] the war, the growing possibility of defeat created anxiety among the Japanese army. Because of the Japanese military's policy to never surrender, Japanese soldiers never received any training about how to act as POWs: upon returning to Japanese ranks, many would face disgrace, punishment, and starvation. Many Japanese soldiers committed suicide after their capture, but those who chose to live generally came to sympathize with the Chinese. The Japanese army was aware of the existence of Nosaka's Communist Japanese soldiers, and feared the phenomena out of proportion to their actual threat. Koji Ariyoshi, an American who met Nosaka in Yan'an wrote that Nosaka was [...] "the Japanese national who undoubtedly contributed the most in the war against Japanese militarism". The Japanese army attempted to use numerous spies and assassins in order to eliminate Nosaka (who used the name [...] "Okano Susumu" [...] {{for the duration of the}} war), but were unsuccessful. Nosaka maintained a network of agents throughout Japanese-occupied China, which he used to gather information about events within the Japanese Empire and about the war.|$|E
