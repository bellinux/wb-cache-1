500|$|Before {{going on}} tour with her Harajuku Lovers Tour (2005), Stefani {{revealed}} {{that she was}} going to release a second album in 2006, stating: [...] "I have a bunch of leftover tracks from making 'Love. Angel. Music. Baby.'. And two months ago, Pharrell called me up, he was like, 'Come down to Miami and write some more songs!' And I'm like, 'OK!' I went down there and wrote four songs and played three of them tonight. They're really fresh". In September 2006, during the Fashion Week, MTV News interviewed Swizz Beatz <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be working with Stefani as well, claiming: [...] "She's always taking it to the next level. I love her background for music. She likes a lot of Caribbean sounds with hard beats". They worked on [...] "Now That You Got It", which was selected to be the fourth single from The Sweet Escape (2006). For the single version, Stefani enlisted Damian Marley, son of Jamaican reggae musician Bob Marley, giving the single a [...] "reggae" [...] feel to it. It was released to mainstream radio in the United States, on August 26, 2007, while in the United Kingdom, it was released on October 15, 2007. Two remixes were included on the CD single, both featuring Marley. The [...] "remix" [...] version uses the same instrumentation as the original single, but has a more reggae-infused rendition and an added verse sung by Marley; the [...] "" [...] version features the song's original beat mixed with the remix version.|$|E
500|$|Davis proved, perhaps, to be {{the most}} pivotal instrumentalist during these sessions. [...] "If you listen to the album, every tune is led by Richard and {{everybody}} followed Richard and Van's voice," [...] says Merenstein. [...] "I knew if I brought Richard in, he would put the bottom on to support what Van wanted to do vocally, or acoustically. Then you get Jay playing those beautiful counter-lines to Van." [...] Davis was not impressed by Morrison, but not out of disdain or any preconceived notions, but rather because Morrison's professional comportment generally did not meet Davis's expectations. [...] "No prep, no meeting," [...] recalls Davis. [...] "He was remote from us, 'cause he came in and went into a booth... And that's where he stayed, isolated in a booth. I don't think he ever introduced himself to us, nor we to him... And he seemed very shy..." [...] Drummer Connie Kay later told Rolling Stone that he approached Morrison and asked [...] "what he wanted me to play, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> play whatever I felt like playing. We more or less sat there and jammed." [...] Morrison's impression of the sessions was [...] "The songs came together very well in the studio. Some of the tracks were first takes. [...] the musicians were really together. Those type of guys play what you're gonna do before you do it, that's how good they are." [...] He told Ritchie Yorke that only two tracks recorded during the sessions did not make it to the album. [...] "One was about Jesse James and the other about trains. They were both just basic blues numbers. That's why they didn't fit in with the album." ...|$|E

Around 194, Sun Ce, under a commission from the warlord Yuan Shu, entered Yang Province to aid his relatives, Wu Jing and Sun Ben, who were under attack by another warlord Liu Yao. When Sun Ce was at Liyang (歷陽; present-day He County, Anhui) and was preparing to cross the Yangtze River to attack Liu Yao, he sent a messenger to inform Zhou Yu about his plans.

2500|$|Xiang Yu {{and his men}} made a {{last stand}} against wave after wave of Han forces until only Xiang himself was left alive. Xiang Yu {{continued}} to fight on and [...] slew over 100 enemy soldiers, but he had also sustained several wounds all over his body. Just then, Xiang Yu saw an old friend Lü Matong among the Han soldiers, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> Lü, [...] "I heard that the King of Han (Liu Bang) has placed a price of 1,000 gold and the title of [...] "Wanhu Marquis" [...] (萬戶侯; lit. [...] "marquis of 10,000 households") on my head. Take it then, on account of our friendship." [...] Xiang Yu then committed suicide by slitting his throat with his sword, and a brawl broke out among the Han soldiers at the scene due to the reward offered by Liu Bang, and Xiang Yu's body {{was said to be}} dismembered and mutilated in the fight. The reward was eventually claimed by Lü Matong and five others.|$|E

2500|$|Although Beckett {{refused to}} be drawn on the {{backgrounds}} of the characters, this has not stopped actors looking for their own motivation. Jean Martin had a doctor friend called Marthe Gautier, who {{was working at the}} Salpêtrière Hospital, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> her: [...] "'Listen, Marthe, what could I find that would provide some kind of physiological explanation for a voice like the one written in the text?' [...] said: 'Well, {{it might be a good}} idea if you went to see the people who have Parkinson's disease.' So I asked her about the disease ... She explained how it begins with a trembling, which gets more and more noticeable, until later the patient can no longer speak without the voice shaking. So I said, 'That sounds exactly what I need.'" [...] "Sam and Roger were not entirely convinced by my interpretation but had no objections." [...] When he explained to Beckett that he was playing Lucky as if he were suffering from Parkinson's, Beckett said, [...] "'Yes, of course.'

2500|$|Schweitzer {{continues}} {{writing in}} The Quest of the Historical Jesus {{that it is}} totally unreasonable to think that [...] "coming quickly", [...] "near", and [...] "soon" [...] could mean hundreds of years, much less, thousands {{of years in the}} future. [...] "Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and heed the things which are written in it; for the time is near." [...] (Revelation 1:3) [...] "And he said to me, 'These words are faithful and true'; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent His angel to show to His bond-servants the things which must soon take place." [...] "And behold, I am coming quickly. Blessed is he who heeds the words of the prophecy of this book." [...] <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> me, [...] "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near" [...] (Revelation 22:6, 7, 10, 12). [...] "All these things shall come upon this generation" [...] (Matthew 23:36). Schweitzer concludes that the 1st-century theology, originating in the lifetimes of those who first followed Jesus, is totally incompatible with modern Christian belief.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell's {{opposition to the}} nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court, of which Falwell had said, [...] "Every good Christian should be concerned", Goldwater retorted: [...] "Every good Christian ought to kick Falwell right in the ass." [...] (According to John Dean, Goldwater actually suggested that good Christians ought to kick Falwell in the [...] "nuts", but the news media [...] "changed the anatomical reference.") Goldwater also had harsh words for his one-time political protegé, President Reagan, particularly after the Iran–Contra Affair became public in 1986. Journalist Robert MacNeil, a friend of Goldwater's from the 1964 Presidential campaign, recalled interviewing him in his office shortly afterward. [...] "He {{was sitting in his}} office with his hands on his cane... <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> me, 'Well, aren't you going to ask me about the Iran arms sales?' It had just been announced that the Reagan administration had sold arms to Iran. And I said, 'Well, if I asked you, what would you say?' He said, 'I'd say it's the god-damned stupidest foreign policy blunder this country's ever made!'", though aside from the Iran–Contra scandal, Goldwater thought nonetheless that Reagan was a good president.

And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he gave him charge over all the labour of the house of Joseph. And it came to pass at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field.

2500|$|When {{the strike}} broke out, Ceaușescu {{and his wife}} Elena were on a Black Sea vacation.

[...] (in reference to the Lupeni Strike of 1929, enshrined in the mythology of the Romanian Communist Party), {{in an effort to}} add legitimacy to their cause. Dobre read the list of grievances to Ceaușescu, presenting 26 demands related to work hours, production targets, pensions, supplies, housing and investments. They asked for a restoration of the status quo ante in social legislation, the guarantee of adequate food supplies and medical care, the establishment of workers’ commissions at the enterprise level empowered to dismiss incompetent or corrupt managers, and a pledge of no reprisals against the strikers. After that, Dobre recalled, [...] "While my name was being shouted, I turned toward Ceaușescu, gave him the list from which I had read <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> me: 'Thank you for informing me, comrade'.
