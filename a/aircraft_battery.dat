5|$|Major General Ennis Whitehead's Advanced Echelon (ADVON) {{headquarters}} in Port Moresby ordered three squadrons based there {{to join the}} battle. P-38s of the 39th Fighter Squadron engaged a dozen Japanese fighters over Wau, shooting one down. A few minutes later, the 9th Fighter Squadron—which had only recently converted to the P-38—downed another Japanese fighter, while P-40s of the 41st Fighter Squadron surprised six Japanese fighters, shooting down three. The airmen claimed to have shot down 23 Japanese fighters and a bomber. Australian gunners of the 156th Light Anti <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Battery</b> claimed another bomber and two fighters. For its part in the battle, the 374th Troop Carrier Group was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation.|$|E
5|$|In the North, the {{commander}} of 1. Kavalleriedivision, Major General Kurt Feldt, faced the unenviable task of having to advance over the Enclosure Dike {{because of a lack}} of ships. This dam was blocked by the Kornwerderzand Position, which protected a major sluice complex regulating the water level of Lake IJssel, which had to be sufficiently high to allow many Fortress Holland inundations to be maintained. The main fortifications contained 47mm antitank-guns. Long channel piers projected in front of and behind the sluices, on both the right and left; on these, pillboxes had been built which could place a heavy enfilading fire on the dam, which did not provide the slightest cover for any attacker. On 13 May the position was reinforced by a 20mm anti <b>aircraft</b> <b>battery.</b> It had been Feldt's intention to first destroy the position by a battery of siege mortars, but the train transporting it had been blocked on 10 May by a blown railway bridge at Winschoten. Several air attacks on 13 May had little effect; in the late afternoon five bicycle sections tried to approach the main bunker complex under cover of an artillery bombardment, but soon fled after being fired upon; the first was pinned down and could only retreat under cover of darkness, leaving behind some dead.|$|E

50|$|In 1922, Fühlingen was {{incorporated}} into Cologne. The Second World War left the place almost intact despite its proximity to the chemical plants in Leverkusen and Dormagen, {{as well as the}} anti <b>aircraft</b> <b>batteries</b> stationed in the vicinity.|$|R
25|$|However the {{floating}} hulk was on captured on 14 May 1940 by the invading German forces. The ship sank after {{being attacked by}} a British aircraft on 21 and 22 June 1940. The Germans decided to salvage her in October 1940 and converted her into an Anti <b>Aircraft</b> <b>battery</b> at Antwerpen. The conversion lasted from 1941 to 1943 and the ship was renamed Ariadne. After the war the ship was recovered in Wilhelmshaven and given back to the Netherlands, to be converted at the Wilton-Fijenoord shipyard into an accommodation ship. On 21 October 1947 she was recommissioned and given back her initial name Hertog Hendrik. She was finally decommissioned on 27 September 1968 and stricken from the navy list on 28 August 1969.|$|E
500|$|During German bombing raids {{targeted}} on Bristol, many bombs {{fell in the}} parish: Ruen House on {{the road}} to Chew Hill was bombed. The nearly flat area just east of the Y-junction on Chew Hill was initially chosen as a Starfish site area to be lit by fires to simulate Bristol in flames. Later, about half way between North Chew Farm and Manor Farm, North Wick was an area secured by Royal Air Force personnel, lit by fires, and with [...] "automatic" [...] guns to simulate anti-aircraft guns. There was also a genuine heavy anti <b>aircraft</b> <b>battery</b> at Chewhill farm. The area was guarded by pill boxes of which one remains {{on the west side of}} Blacklands (map reference ST579640).|$|E
500|$|Fifth Air Force fighters {{provided}} {{air cover}} from 06:45. A Japanese reconnaissance aircraft {{flew over the}} beachhead at 09:10, and was shot down. [...] A lone bomber showed up ten minutes later and attacked the LSTs on the beach, but missed. Two dive bombers attacked at 09:30, and were driven off, but not before inflicting casualties. The Bofors guns of the 10th Light Anti <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Battery</b> were attacked, and five men were wounded, one fatally. Over {{the next two weeks}} there was at least one air raid on the beachhead every day. The air raids proved an effective way of clearing the beach. A large attack by 39 aircraft of the 4th Air Army ran into bad weather and had to return to Wewak, but a naval air forces attack with 38 Zeke fighters and eight Betty bombers found the LSTs and destroyers near the Tami Islands on their way back to Buna at 12:40. The fighter cover was being changed over, so the Fifth Air Force fighter controller on board the destroyer [...] could deploy five squadrons instead of just three. They claimed to have shot down 29 fighters and 10 bombers. Antiaircraft gunners from the destroyers, LSTs, and Sonoma also engaged the bombers. While torpedo wakes were seen, no hits were suffered. Three Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighters were shot down, but at least one pilot was rescued. The Japanese pilots claimed to have sunk two cruisers, two destroyers, and two transports.|$|E

2500|$|Gun {{batteries}} {{were also}} {{installed on the}} Humber foreshore at Stallingborough {{in the first and}} second world wars. During the First World War Stallingborough battery had two 6 inch breech-loading Mk VII guns; the First World War fort is evidenced by a pillbox. There was also a [...] airfield (closed 1919) used by a flight of No. 251 Squadron RAF which carried out marine patrols with Airco DH.6 planes. During the Second World War the site was again used, with 4.7 inch quick-firing gun and a searchlight. There was also an anti <b>aircraft</b> <b>battery</b> at Little London, with positions for four guns. Post war a location near the Little London site was used as a Royal Observer Corps monitoring post.|$|E

50|$|In 2011, the Federal Aviation Administration {{temporarily}} grounded the CJ4 {{and issued}} an airworthiness directive because of {{fires in the}} original Lithium-ion battery equipment: We are adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Cessna Aircraft Company (Cessna) Model 525C airplanes. This emergency AD was sent previously to all known U.S. owners and operators of these airplanes. This AD requires replacing certain lithium-ion batteries installed as the main <b>aircraft</b> <b>battery</b> with either a Ni-Cad or a lead acid battery.
