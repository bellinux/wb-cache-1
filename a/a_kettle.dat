5|$|The video cuts {{between two}} narratives. In the first, a hunter (uncredited actor) straps a 16-gauge shotgun around his shoulder, and tracks {{footsteps}} through the snow, eventually finding the Swamplord (the band's mascot, here as depicted {{on the covers}} of The Black Waltz and For the Revolution). In the second narrative, the band members, dressed warmly in heavy clothing, are sitting around a campfire, preparing <b>a</b> <b>kettle</b> of an unknown drink. As each person takes a sip, they begin convulsing. To simulate the drink's effects, the camera used shaking and rapid zooming. As the song finishes, Pekka pours himself a drink and is the only one immune to its effects.|$|E
5|$|Teapot: The teapot {{was invented}} during the Yuan Dynasty, tea {{preparation}} in previous dynasties did not utilize a teapot. In the Tang Dynasty, a cauldron {{was used to}} boil grounded tea, which was served in bowls. Song Dynasty tea was made by pouring water boiled using <b>a</b> <b>kettle</b> into a bowl with finely ground tea leaves. A brush was then used to stir the tea. The innovation of the teapot, a vessel that steeps tea leaves in boiling water, occurs during the late Yuan dynasty. Written evidence of a teapot appears in the Yuan Dynasty text, Jiyuan Conghua, which describes a teapot that the author, Cai Shizhan, bought from the scholar Sun Daoming. By the Ming Dynasty, teapots were widespread in China.|$|E

25|$|By the 17th century, it {{was common}} for a Western kitchen to contain a number of skillets, baking pans, <b>a</b> <b>kettle</b> and several pots, along {{with a variety of}} pot hooks and trivets. Brass or copper vessels were common in Asia and Europe, whilst iron pots were common in the American colonies.

25|$|Choosing {{the right}} heat {{exchanger}} (HX) requires {{some knowledge of}} the different heat exchanger types, {{as well as the}} environment where the unit must operate. Typically in the manufacturing industry, several differing types of heat exchangers are used for just one process or system to derive the final product. For example, <b>a</b> <b>kettle</b> HX for pre-heating, a double pipe HX for the ‘carrier’ fluid and a plate and frame HX for final cooling. With sufficient knowledge of heat exchanger types and operating requirements, an appropriate selection can be made to optimise the process.|$|E

25|$|The {{scene was}} {{attended}} by Superintendent Thomas Arnold and Inspector Edmund Reid from Whitechapel's H Division, as well as Frederick Abberline and Robert Anderson from Scotland Yard. Arnold had the room broken into at 1:30p.m. after the possibility of tracking the murderer from the room with bloodhounds was dismissed as impractical. A fire fierce enough to melt the solder between <b>a</b> <b>kettle</b> and its spout had burnt in the grate, apparently fuelled with clothing. Inspector Abberline thought Kelly's clothes were burnt by the murderer to provide light, as the room was otherwise only dimly lit by a single candle.|$|E

500|$|The sweet wort {{collected}} from sparging {{is put into}} <b>a</b> <b>kettle,</b> or [...] "copper" [...] (so called because these vessels were traditionally made from copper), and boiled, usually for about one hour. During boiling, water in the wort evaporates, but the sugars and other components of the wort remain; this allows more efficient use of the starch sources in the beer. Boiling also destroys any remaining enzymes {{left over from the}} mashing stage. Hops are added during boiling as a source of bitterness, flavour and aroma. Hops may be added at more than one point during the boil. The longer the hops are boiled, the more bitterness they contribute, but the less hop flavour and aroma remains in the beer.|$|E
500|$|Moffat's script {{started by}} repeating Martha's departure. The script {{indicated}} that [...] "this time, we {{stay with the}} Doctor. As before ... the Doctor takes a moment, then slam the controls," [...] and described the Fifth Doctor as having a [...] "frock coat, cricket jersey, and a stick of celery on his lapel". Moffat included several references to Fifth Doctor stories in his script: the Tenth Doctor commented about the Fifth Doctor's attire and his disuse of the sonic screwdriver, saying: [...] "Ooh, I'm the Doctor, I can save the universe with <b>a</b> <b>kettle</b> {{and a piece of}} string and ooh, look at me, I'm wearing a vegetable." [...] A line about the effects of the paradox the TARDIS collision had caused gave an explanation of why the Fifth Doctor looked far older than normal, thus getting around the fact that Peter Davison had left the role over twenty years before. [...] And {{near the end of the}} episode, he refers to Tegan Jovanka, Nyssa, the Cybermen stories Earthshock and The Five Doctors, the Mara serials Kinda and Snakedance, the Time Lords' [...] "funny hats" [...] from Arc of Infinity, and the various Ainley Master stories during Davison's tenure.|$|E

500|$|The gang {{lived in}} or around London. [...] For a time Turpin stayed at Whitechapel, {{before moving to}} Millbank. [...] On 4February 1735 he met John Fielder, Samuel Gregory, Joseph Rose, and John Wheeler, at an inn along The Broadway in London. [...] They planned to rob the house of Joseph Lawrence, a farmer at Earlsbury Farm in Edgware. [...] Late that afternoon, after {{stopping}} twice along the way for food and drink, they captured a shepherd boy and burst into the house, armed with pistols. [...] They bound the two maidservants, and brutally attacked the 70-year-old farmer. [...] They pulled his breeches around his ankles, and dragged him around the house, but Lawrence refused to reveal the whereabouts of his money. [...] Turpin beat Lawrence's bare buttocks with his pistols, badly bruising him, {{and other members of}} the gang beat him around the head with their pistols. [...] They emptied <b>a</b> <b>kettle</b> of water over his head, forced him to sit bare-buttocked on the fire, and pulled him around the house by his nose, and hair. [...] Gregory took one of the maidservants upstairs and raped her. [...] For their trouble, the gang escaped with a haul of less than £30.|$|E
500|$|Ghosh {{acknowledges}} the allusions to Ray's films. In one scene, Vidya asks {{the manager of}} the guest house why there is no hot water although the signboard had claimed [...] "running hot water". The manager explains that the sign refers for his errand boy, who runs to deliver hot water in <b>a</b> <b>kettle</b> whenever required. This alludes to a similar scene in Ray's Joi Baba Felunath (1979). In an interview with The Telegraph, Ghosh says that the way Vidya looks out and moves from window to window in the guest-house room is reminiscent of Ray's Charulata (1964), where the actress Madhabi Mukherjee enjoys glimpses of the outside world through the blinds of windows. He also {{acknowledges the}} influence of Mahanagar (1963), another Ray film noted for its portrayal of Kolkata. According to the director, he was inspired by particular scenes of Ray's Nayak (1966) to plan the portrayal of complex emotional issues between Vidya and the police officer Rana, especially Rana's awe in the presence of Vidya. Ghosh expresses his inspiration from Ray's Aranyer Dinratri (1970) in which Ray [...] "wanted the audience to be inside the car with the four guys all the time. So the camera never leaves the car." [...] Ghosh shot a similar scene, hoping the audience would become [...] "like Vidya's fellow passenger." ...|$|E
500|$|Rogers stocked his {{ships with}} limes {{to fend off}} scurvy, a {{practice}} not universally accepted at that time. [...] After reaching the Pacific Ocean, the ships' provisions of limes were exhausted and seven men died of the vitamin deficiency disease. Dampier was able to guide the ships to little-known Juan Fernandez Island to replenish supplies of fresh produce. On 1 February 1709, as they neared the island, the sailors spotted a fire ashore and feared {{that it might be}} a shore party from a Spanish vessel. The next morning Rogers sent a party ashore and discovered that the fire was from Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk, who had been stranded there four years previously. Selkirk was to become an inspiration for the classic novel Robinson Crusoe, written by Rogers' friend, Daniel Defoe. Rogers found Selkirk to be [...] "wild-looking" [...] and [...] "wearing goatskins", noting in his journal, [...] "He had with him his clothes and bedding, with a firelock, some powder, bullets and tobacco, a hatchet, a knife, <b>a</b> <b>kettle,</b> a Bible and books." [...] Selkirk, who {{had been part of the}} ship's crew that abandoned Dampier after losing confidence in his leadership, was now more than willing to join a flotilla that included his old commodore as ship's pilot. Selkirk served as a mate aboard the Duke, and was later given command of one of the prize ships taken by the expedition.|$|E
