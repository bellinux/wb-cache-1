2500|$|In May 2004, Barenboim {{was awarded}} the Wolf Prize at a {{ceremony}} at the Israeli Knesset. Education Minister Livnat held up the nomination until Barenboim apologized for his performance of Wagner in Israel. Barenboim called Livnat's demand [...] "politically motivated", adding [...] "I don't see what I need to apologize <b>about.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> ever hurt a person privately or in public, I am sorry, because I {{have no intention of}} hurting people...", which was good enough for Livnat. The ceremony was boycotted by Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin, {{also a member of the}} Likud party. In his acceptance speech, Barenboim expressed his opinion on the political situation, referring to the Israeli Declaration of Independence in 1948: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It’s {{a smooth}} sea," [...] said he, {{looking at the}} perturbed countenance of Private Smith, [...] "’an there’s a lot of {{shipping}} <b>about.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> was a deserter, sooner than be caught, I would slip overboard to-night with a lifebelt and take my chance." ...|$|E
60|$|LORD SUMMERHAYS. You {{mean you}} can tell Bentley <b>about</b> me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> do.|$|R
5000|$|There {{would be}} nothing strange <b>about</b> it <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were to die (if such a {{situation}} occurred).|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't talk <b>about</b> it. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> {{choose to}} lend {{it to my}} brother and you without security, there's nothing very {{uncommon}} in that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Me feeling brave? What are {{you talking}} <b>about?</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> was as timid as you are, I wouldn't ever talk about bravery to other people. If there is {{anything}} you dare to do that I don't, I've never heard of it," [...] retorted Sammy Jay.|$|E
6000|$|And then, [...] "It's a lark, our marrying. It's curious 'ow {{things come}} <b>about.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> 'adn't run against you, where should I 'ave been now. Eh?... Even after we met, I didn't {{seem to see}} it like--not marrying you I mean--until that night I came. I didn't--reely." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Girls is so 'cute. Ruby {{is awful}} 'cute. It {{makes me feel}} as though I had two hun'erdweight o' meal on my stomach, lying awake o' nights and {{thinking}} as how he is, may be,--pulling of her <b>about!</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> thought that she'd let him--; oh! I'd swing for it, Muster Carbury. They'd {{have to make an}} eend o' me at Bury, if it was that way. They would then.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well. Now, Marian, remember--nothing <b>about</b> HIM <b>if</b> <b>I</b> get the place. I don't wish {{to bring}} his name down to the dirt." ...|$|R
60|$|ACIS [evidently {{out of his}} depth] I shouldn't {{think too}} much <b>about</b> it <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were you. You have to keep sane, you know.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{see much}} hair of any color," [...] said Marilla. [...] "I wouldn't worry <b>about</b> it, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were you, {{until it becomes}} visible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I couldn't forgive {{myself at}} such a time as this, Mr Walter,' said Susan, 'and when there's so much serious {{distress}} to think <b>about,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> rested hard on anyone, especially on them that little darling Paul speaks well of, but I may wish that the family was set to work in a stony soil to make new roads, and that Miss Blimber went in front, and had the pickaxe!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Life isn't all {{a matter}} of dollars," [...] Vine {{answered}} contemptuously. [...] "There are other things worth thinking <b>about.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> strike at you and your friends, it is not for the money or the notoriety I could make out of it. It is because I want to attack a villainous system, because I consider that you and Weiss and the rest of you are really doing your best to throttle the greatest country on God's earth." ...|$|E
6000|$|The king {{then took}} a great desire for her, and ordered her brother {{to go home and}} bring her back with him, for he trusted no one better to {{accomplish}} that errand. He got a ship, and everything else that he required, and sailed home for his sister. As soon as the stepmother heard what his errand was she at once said to herself, 'This will never come <b>about</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can do anything to hinder it. She must not be allowed to come to such honour.' ...|$|E
60|$|I read no newspapers, {{and hardly}} {{remember}} who is President, and feel as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{had no more}} concern with what other people trouble themselves <b>about</b> than <b>if</b> <b>I</b> dwelt in another planet.|$|R
6000|$|... "All the same," [...] {{rejoined the}} parson, firing the last shot; [...] "I'd think twice <b>about</b> it, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were you, before I married Mary Lowther." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But maybe, Madge, ye wad mind {{something}} <b>about</b> it, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was to gie ye this half-crown?" [...] said Sharpitlaw, {{taking out}} the piece of money.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know that; {{they have}} to me, for instance. These are the things which I would write <b>about</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had any turn for verse, not about human nature, of which I know, I'm afraid, {{a little too much}} already. I always like to read old 'Darwin's Loves of the Plants;' bosh as it is in a {{scientific}} point of view, it amuses one's fancy without making one lose one's temper, as one must when one begins to analyse the microscopic ape called self and friends.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Well, well, now,' says I. 'I {{guess that}} man made a mistake. Maybe {{it was some}} other boy he was talking <b>about.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> catch him I'll teach him to go around slandering people.' And after supper I goes up town and {{telegraphs}} to Mrs. Conyers, 862 Poplar Avenue, Quincy, Ill., that the kid is safe and sassy with us, and will be held for further orders. In two hours an answer comes to hold him tight, and she'll start for him by next train.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, I hardly {{expected}} {{you would}} take good advice, but it was my duty to give it. Just now I'll leave you to your own resources, because Dom Pedro is waiting with the chessmen below. Most gentlemanly old rascal, and you are indebted to him; but I wouldn't tell him too much respecting the supposititious treasure you rambled <b>about</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were you. Henceforward {{you will have to}} get better in your own way, because word has just been sent me that my niggers are dying by dozens." ...|$|E
6000|$|Molly's eyes sparkled, but {{she gave}} a little shrug as she answered, [...] "She won't care. She never {{troubles}} herself <b>about</b> me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> let her alone.|$|R
6000|$|... "There--I wouldn't {{give myself}} any worry <b>about</b> that, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was you. And besides, I can settle {{what you would}} do. Are you any {{different}} from me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bo, {{this town}} {{is no place for}} you. Understand? You ride this train out, and make no mistake <b>about</b> it. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> catch you after it's gone ..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There it {{is again}} on the other side!' said the Snow-man, by which he meant the sun was {{appearing}} again. 'I have become quite accustomed to its glaring. I hope it will hang there and shine, so that I {{may be able to}} see myself. I wish I knew, though, how one ought to see about changing one's position. I should very much like to move <b>about.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> only could, I would glide up and down the ice there, as I saw the boys doing; but somehow or other, I don't know how to run.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} that I do pride myself on my swimming, Giles Taunton," [...] Ned said composedly; [...] "at any rate, no one has ever heard me speak of such {{abilities}} as I may have in that way. As to the natives, they have seen each other fight with sharks, and know how the matter is gone <b>about.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> were to be present a few times, when such strife takes place, it may be that I should not shirk from joining in the sport; but knowing nothing whatever of the method pursued, or of the manner of attack, I should be worse than a fool, were I to propose to venture my life in such a sport." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I do wish it, because I {{think it}} will be best for you," [...] I replied, without looking at her. [...] "You must marry some time, Betty, and Frank is the only man I know to whom I could trust you. As your guardian, I have an {{interest}} in seeing you well and wisely settled for life. You have always taken my advice and obeyed my wishes; and you've always found my way the best, in the long run, haven't you, Betty? You won't prove rebellious now, I'm sure. You know quite well that I am advising you for your own good. Frank is a splendid young fellow, who loves you with all his heart. Marry him, Betty. Mind, I don't COMMAND. I have no right to do that, and you are too old to be ordered <b>about,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had. But I wish and advise it. Isn't that enough, Betty?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{the other}} eagerly assented. [...] "I was told, at your county seat, that I could learn all <b>about</b> it <b>if</b> <b>I</b> asked for Squire Braile, here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shouldn't worry <b>about</b> it <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was you," [...] he remarked. [...] "She's hardly {{likely to}} find you now. And if she does she won't get much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite well, sir, but {{he never}} held up his head since he heard it, and poor Miss Mary has so moped <b>about.</b> <b>If</b> ever <b>I</b> thought to see the like--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is what I want {{to speak}} <b>about.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> can see {{the list of the}} sums to be paid, and if you can assure {{yourself}} that by paying them I shall get back all the post-obit bonds which Mountjoy has given, and that the money can be at once raised upon a joint mortgage, to be executed by me and Augustus, I will do it. But the first thing must be to know the amount. I will join Augustus in nothing without your consent. He wants to assume the power himself. In fact, the one thing he desires is that I shall go. As long as I remain he shall do nothing except by my co-operation. I will see you and him to-morrow, and now you may go and eat your dinner. I cannot tell you how much obliged I am to you for coming." [...] And then Mr. Grey left the room, went to his chamber, and in process of time made his way into the drawing-room.|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon {{this the}} fine-looking skipper gave signs of distress. The ship mustn't miss the next morning's tide. He {{had to take}} on board forty tons of {{dynamite}} and a hundred and twenty tons of gunpowder at a place down the river before proceeding to sea. It was all arranged for next day. There would be no end of fuss and complications if the ship didn't turn up in time.--I couldn't help hearing all this, while wishing him to take himself off, because I {{wanted to know why}} Mr Powell had told me to wait. After what he had been saying there didn't seem any object in my hanging <b>about.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> had had my certificate in my pocket I should have tried to slip away quietly; but Mr Powell had turned about into the same position I found him in at first and was again swinging his leg. My certificate open on the desk was under his left elbow and I couldn't very well go up and jerk it away.|$|E
6000|$|... 'MY DEAR ETHELBERTA,--I {{have tried}} to like staying at Sandbourne [...] because you wished it, but I can't endure the town at all, dear Berta; [...] {{everything}} is so wretched and dull! O, I only wish you knew how [...] dismal it is here, and how much I would give to come to London! I [...] cannot help thinking that I could do better in town. You see, I [...] should be close to you, and should {{have the benefit of}} your [...] experience. I would not mind what I did for a living could I be there [...] where you all are. It is so like banishment to be here. If I could [...] not get a pupil-teachership in some London school (and I believe I [...] could by advertising) I could stay with you, and be governess to [...] Georgina and Myrtle, for I am sure you cannot spare time enough to [...] teach them as they ought to be taught, and Emmeline is not old enough [...] to have any command over them. I could also assist at your [...] dressmaking, and you must require a great deal of that to be done if [...] you continue to appear in public. Mr. Long read in the papers the [...] account of your first evening, and afterwards I heard two ladies of [...] our committee talking about it; but of course not one of them knew my [...] personal interest in the discussion. Now will you, Ethelberta, think [...] if I may not come: Do, there's a dear sister! I will do anything you [...] set me <b>about</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> may only come.--Your ever affectionate, [...] PICOTEE.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! I {{need not}} have asked <b>about</b> her <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had thought a moment beforehand. Father Rocco would {{be sure to keep}} her out of Fabio's sight, for his niece's sake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Mary, then I'll {{tell you}} exactly how it is--but mind, I don't want it talked about yet for rasons; so you won't say {{anything}} <b>about</b> it <b>if</b> <b>I</b> tell you?" ...|$|R
60|$|My {{fingers are}} {{beginning}} to get horribly numb, and I'm afraid I shan't {{be able to write}} much longer. I must be quick <b>about</b> it, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> want to finish this confession.|$|R
