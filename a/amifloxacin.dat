The potency of the quinolones as DNA gyrase inhibitors did not always correlate with antimicrobial potency. For example, OFL was a less potent inhibitor of gyrase than rosoxacin, yet the MIC of OFL was 16 -fold lower than that of rosoxacin. Similarly, the MICs of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin (the most potent of the antibiotics tested in these assays) were several hundredfold lower than the MIC of nalidixic acid (the least potent of these antibiotics), but the inhibition of purified gyrase by these two quinolones was only 8 - to 16 -fold lower than that of nalidixic acid. These results suggest that factors in addition to inhibition of gyrase supercoiling activity are important in determining the potency of these drugs. Further studies indicated that the uptake of norfloxacin, OFL, and <b>amifloxacin</b> by M. luteus cells may not account for the large differences in MICs observed for these drugs (MICs of 0. 8, 2. 0, and 128 micrograms/ml, respectively) ...|$|E
40|$|Quinolone {{antibiotics}} {{have been}} proposed as possible alternatives to vancomycin for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. We investigated the activities of <b>amifloxacin,</b> ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and vancomycin by time-kill kinetic studies.

Staphylococci were plated onto ciprofloxacin-containing agar at all time points, in repeat time-kill kinetic studies. Macrobroth dilution MICs and MBCs were determined. Ciprofloxacin levels were measured by bioassay. Replica plating was performed from the original susceptible inoculum (MIC, 0. 125 micrograms/ml) onto ciprofloxacin-supplemented agar. At 4. 0 times the MIC, only with ciprofloxacin was there regrowth at 24 and 48 h. All four strains of staphylococci grew on agar supplemented with 1 microgram of ciprofloxacin per ml; three of four grew on agar supplemented with 2 micrograms of ciprofloxacin per ml. MICs and MBCs for these resistant clones ranged from 8 to 32 micrograms/ml. No degradation in activity or amount of ciprofloxacin could be detected in the bioassay. Replica-plated staphylococci grew on agar containing 1 microgram/ml but not higher concentrations of ciprofloxacin at 48 h. <b>Amifloxacin</b> and norfloxacin sustained bactericidal activity {{comparable to that of}} vancomycin.

Antibiotic concentrations {{equal to or greater}} than the broth dilution MIC inhibited or killed L. pneumophila by the time kill method, except {{this was not the case}} for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Antibiotic concentrations below the broth dilution MIC did not inhibit Legionella growth. The only antibiotic-rifampin combinations which produced improved killing of L. pneumophila by the time kill method were those in which the logarithmic growth of L. pneumophila occurred during the experiment (rosoxacin, <b>amifloxacin,</b> cinoxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin, and doxycycline).

Rifampin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, rosoxacin, enoxacin, <b>amifloxacin,</b> gentamicin, clindamycin, and doxycycline all inhibited intracellular L. pneumophila growth at readily achievable concentrations in serum. Cefoxitin and thienamycin showed no inhibition of growth, although they were present extracellularly at concentrations that were 20 to 1, 000 times their broth dilution MICs. Clindamycin was the only antibiotic that was able to inhibit intracellular L. pneumophila growth at an extracellular concentration below its MIC.

However, against synergy-resistant isolates the activities of these two quinolones were comparable with and sometimes greater than those of penicillin-aminoglycoside combinations...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{resistance of}} genital mycoplasmas to tetracycline poses {{a problem because}} tetracycline {{is one of the}} few antimicrobial agents active against Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, chlamydiae, gonococci, and other agents of genitourinary-tract disease. Since the quinolones are a promising group of antimicrobial agents, the susceptibilities of M. hominis and U. urealyticum to the newer 6 -fluoroquinolones were determined by the agar dilution method. Ciprofloxacin, difloxacin, and ofloxacin had good activity against M. hominis, with the MIC for 50 % of isolates tested (MIC 50) being 1 microgram/ml. Fleroxacin, lomefloxacin, pefloxacin, and rosoxacin had MIC 50 s of 2 micrograms/ml. Enoxacin, norfloxacin, and <b>amifloxacin</b> had MIC 50 s of 8 to 16 micrograms/ml, and cinoxacin and nalidixic acid were inactive (MIC 50, greater than or equal to 256 micrograms/ml). Overall, the activities of 6 -fluoroquinolones for ureaplasmas were similar to those for M. hominis, with MICs being the same or twofold greater. The most active 6 -fluoroquinolones against ureaplasmas were difloxacin, ofloxacin, and pefloxacin, with MIC 50 s of 1 to 2 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin was unusual in that the MIC 50 for M. hominis was 1 microgram/ml, whereas the MIC 50 for ureaplasmas was 8 micrograms/ml. Since the MIC 50 s for the most active quinolones approximate achievable concentrations in blood and urine, quinolones have promise in treating mycoplasmal infections...|$|E
40|$|Identification and {{susceptibility}} {{studies were}} performed on 301 blood and urine Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium isolates. Strep Trio-Tubes S 4, S 5, and S 3 (Carr-Scarborough Microbiologicals, Inc.) were compared with conventional methods for accuracy and rapidity. Of 282 isolates identified as S. faecalis, 98 % were identified by species in 4 h with Trio-Tubes; the same percentage of isolates analyzed by conventional methods were identified in 24 h. All 14 S. faecium isolates (approximately 5 % {{of the total number}} of isolates) were identified by Trio-Tubes in 24 h. In vitro MIC susceptibility testing of the isolates was performed by the Dynatech 2000 microdilution technique (Dynatech Laboratories, Inc.). Several newly developed antimicrobial agents, including imipenem (a carbapenem) and some of the quinolone drugs, i. e., CI- 934, ciprofloxacin, A- 56619, A- 56620, <b>amifloxacin,</b> norfloxacin, and enoxacin, were tested, as were ampicillin, erythromycin, and vancomycin. Both ampicillin and vancomycin showed good activity against S. faecalis, with MICs for 90 % of isolates tested (MIC 90 S) of 1 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively; with S. faecium, ampicillin exhibited an MIC 90 of 16 micrograms/ml and vancomycin exhibited an MIC 90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Of the newer antimicrobial agents, imipenem and CI- 934 exhibited the greatest activity against S. faecalis strains, with MIC 90 S of 2 and 0. 5 micrograms/ml, respectively. MBCs against the isolates were determined with CI- 934, with 90 % of S. faecalis strains showing MBCs of 1 microgram/ml or less...|$|E
40|$|The {{fluoroquinolone}} antibiotics are structurally {{related to}} nalidixic acid. Their primary antibacterial action {{appears to be}} mainly due to inhibition of DNA gyrase (DNA topoisomerase II). We determined the activity of several fluoroquinolones in vitro against two strains of Plasmodium falciparum, FCC 1 (chloroquine susceptible) and VNS (chloroquine resistant). [3 H]hypoxanthine incorporation by malarial parasites was determined at 48 and 96 h. The molarity at which each agent caused a 50 % decrease in the incorporation of [3 H]hypoxanthine {{compared with that of}} drug-free controls was defined as the 50 % inhibitory concentration. The fluoroquinolones evaluated were <b>amifloxacin,</b> ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and pefloxacin. Other DNA gyrase inhibitors tested were nalidixic acid, oxolinic acid, novobiocin, and coumermycin A 1. Among the fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin had the lowest 50 % inhibitory concentrations at 48 h against both chloroquine-susceptible and -resistant strains of P. falciparum, (0. 26 +/- 0. 08) x 10 (- 4) and (0. 38 +/- 0. 15) x 10 (- 4) M, respectively (mean +/- standard deviation). Enoxacin had the lowest 50 % inhibitory concentrations against FCC 1 and VNS at 96 h, 0. 23 x 10 (- 5) and (0. 06 +/- 0. 04) x 10 (- 5) M, respectively. With the VNS strain, fractional inhibitory concentration indexes for the combination of ciprofloxacin and tetracycline were calculated at 48 and 96 h to be 0. 93 and 0. 79, respectively, indicating modest additive effects. The combination of novobiocin with ciprofloxacin showed indifference in the same system. The antimalarial effects of some fluoroquinolones occur at achievable serum concentrations. Whether inhibition of DNA gyrase contributes to the antimalarial activity of the fluoroquinolones is unknown at present...|$|E
40|$|Inhibition of {{cytochrome}} P 450 IA 2 {{activity is}} an important adverse effect of quinolone antibacterial agents. It results in a prolonged half-life for some drugs that are coadministered with quinolones, such as theophylline. The objective of the study described here was to define the parameters for quantifying the inhibitory potencies of quinolones against cytochrome P 450 IA 2 in vivo and in vitro and to investigate {{the relationship between the}} results of both approaches. Cytochrome P 450 IA 2 activity in vitro was measured by using the 3 -demethylation rate of caffeine (500 microM) in human liver microsomes. The inhibitory potency of a quinolone in vitro was determined by calculating the decrease in the activity of cytochrome P 450 IA 2 caused by addition of the quinolone (500 microM) into the incubation medium. The mean values (percent reduction of activity without quinolone) were as follows: enoxacin, 74. 9 %; ciprofloxacin, 70. 4 %; nalidixic acid, 66. 6 %; pipemidic acid, 59. 3 %; norfloxacin, 55. 7 %; lomefloxacin, 23. 4 %; pefloxacin, 22. 0 %; <b>amifloxacin,</b> 21. 4 %; difloxacin, 21. 3 %; ofloxacin, 11. 8 %; temafloxacin, 10. 0 %; fleroxacin, no effect. The inhibitory potency of a quinolone in vivo was defined by a dose- and bioavailability-normalized parameter calculated from changes of the elimination half-life of theophylline and/or caffeine reported in previously published studies. Taking the pharmacokinetics of the quinolones into account, it was possible to differentiate between substances with and without clinically relevant inhibitory effects by using results of in vitro investigations. The in vitro test described here may help to qualitatively predict the relevant drug interactions between quinolones and methylxanthines that occur during therapy...|$|E
40|$|Most {{antibacterial}} agents do {{not affect}} human lymphocyte function, {{but a few}} are inhibitory. In contrast, a pronounced increase in the incorporation of [3 H]thymidine {{in the presence of}} 4 -quinolones was observed in these studies. The uptake of [3 H]thymidine into DNA (trichloroacetic acid precipitable) was significantly increased in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human lymphocytes when they were exposed to eight new 4 -quinolone derivatives, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, A- 56619, A- 56620, <b>amifloxacin,</b> enoxacin, and pefloxacin, at 1. 6 to 6. 25 micrograms/ml for 5 days. Four less antibacterially active 4 -quinolones (nalidixic acid, cinoxacin, flumequine, and pipemidic acid) stimulated [3 H]thymidine incorporation only at higher concentrations or not at all. Kinetic studies showed that incorporation of [3 H]thymidine was not affected or slightly inhibited by ciprofloxacin 2 days after phytohemagglutinin stimulation but was increased on days 3 to 6. The total incorporation of [3 H]thymidine from day 1 to day 6 after phytohemagglutinin stimulation was increased by 42 to 45 % at 5 to 20 micrograms of ciprofloxacin per ml. Increased [3 H]thymidine incorporation was also seen when human lymphocytes were stimulated with mitogens other than phytohemagglutinin. Ciprofloxacin added {{at the start of the}} culture had a more pronounced effect on [3 H]thymidine incorporation than when added later. In spite of the apparent increase in DNA synthesis, lymphocyte growth was inhibited by 20 micrograms of ciprofloxacin per ml, and cell cycle analysis showed that ciprofloxacin inhibited progression through the cell cycle. In addition, immunoglobulin secretion by human lymphocytes stimulated by pokeweed mitogen for Epstein-Barr virus was inhibited by approximately 50 % at 5 micrograms of ciprofloxacin per ml. These results suggest that the 4 -quinolone drugs may also affect eucaryotic cell function in vitro, but additional studies are needed to establish an in vivo relevance...|$|E
40|$|Simple, accurate, {{sensitive}} and selective spectrofluorimetric, atomic absorption spectrometric and spectrophotometric methods are described for the quantitative determination of ten fluoroquinolones (<b>amifloxacin,</b> ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, difloxacin hydrochloride, enoxacin, enrofloxacin, lomefloxacin hydrochloride, levofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin mesylate). The first method was a spectrofluorimetric method in which {{samples of the}} studied drugs in 0. 1 N H 2 SO 4 showed native fluorescence at 450 nm when excitation was at 290 nm. The calibration graph was rectilinear from 0. 3 - 1. 4 &# 956;g mL - 1 (method I). Cobalt sulphate was used for precipitation of the ion associates formed from the reaction with the cited drugs. The formation and solubility of the solid complexes at the optimum conditions of pH and ionic strength values have been studied. The method depends on direct determination of the ions in the precipitate or indirect determination of the ions in the filtrate by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The optimum conditions for precipitation were carefully studied. Rectilinear calibration graphs were obtained {{in the range of}} 3 - 30 &# 956;g mL - 1 for each of the investigated drugs. The molar ratios of the formed chelats were determined by Job's method and their association constants were also calculated (method II). Ammonium vanadate was used for the spectrophotometric determination of the selected fluoroquinolones by oxidation in sulphuric acid medium resulting {{in the development of a}} greenish blue colour measured at 766 nm which was attributed to the vanadium (IV) produced by reduction of vanadium (V) by the selected drugs. The optimum conditions for heating time, reagent concentration and sulphuric acid concentration were carefully studied. The accuracy and precision of the proposed method was confirmed by estimating five or six replicates within Beer's law limits were obtained in the range 10 - 40 &# 956;g mL - 1 for each of the investigated drugs with correlation coefficients not less than 0. 9994 for the investigated drugs (method III). The developed spectrofluorimetric, atomic absorption spectrometric and spectrophotometric methods were applied successfully for the determination of the studied drugs in their pharmaceutical dosage forms with a good precision and accuracy compared to official and reported methods as revealed by t-and F-tests. The first method was approximately ten times more sensitive than the second and third methods. Atomic absorption spectrometric method was also applied for the determination of studied drugs in spiked urine and plasma samples...|$|E
