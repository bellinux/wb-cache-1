5|$|<b>And</b> <b>Yet</b> <b>It</b> Moves is a {{platform}} video game developed by independent developer Broken Rules. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux on April 2, 2009, and a Wii port {{was released on}} the Wii Shop Channel in August 2010. <b>And</b> <b>Yet</b> <b>It</b> Moves was originally designed as a computer science project at the Vienna University of Technology in 2007. When the original prototype won or was nominated for awards at various independent game festivals, the team decided to create a full version of the game.|$|E
5|$|Both the PC and WiiWare {{versions}} of the game received positive reviews, with many critics applauding the gameplay mechanics and the visuals. <b>And</b> <b>Yet</b> <b>It</b> Moves was also released {{as part of the}} third Humble Indie Bundle.|$|E
5|$|Broken Rules {{currently}} {{has no plans}} to develop a sequel to <b>And</b> <b>Yet</b> <b>It</b> Moves, due to the time spent on the game. Bohatsch commented that he is unopposed to the idea and is amenable to proposals to develop such a game.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, yes;--you can say so, I don't doubt. There's a {{many of them}} as can say so, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>it's</b> not in 'em to do it. And there's men as don't know hardly how to say <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>it's</b> {{in their}} hearts all the while." [...] Polly must have been {{thinking}} of Ontario as she made this latter oracular observation.|$|R

6000|$|... "But one doesn't {{know how}} to treat him," [...] said Helen. [...] "I don't like to address him as a servant, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>it's</b> not {{pleasant}} to order a gentleman about." ...|$|R
5|$|<b>And</b> <b>Yet</b> <b>It</b> Moves {{focuses on}} moving the player {{character}} {{through a series}} of hazardous environments. The player possesses the ability to freely rotate the entire game world, transforming walls into floors and vice versa. The game's levels and puzzles are designed around this concept. The game features paper collage styled visuals designed by Jan Hackl and a beatboxing soundtrack performed by Christoph Binder.|$|E
5|$|<b>And</b> <b>Yet</b> <b>It</b> Moves {{received}} generally favorable reviews. The PC version gained aggregate {{scores of}} 71.50% and 75 on GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively, while the WiiWare version gained aggregate scores of 85.30% and 83. Critics applauded the game's unique {{take on the}} platforming genre and the game's paper collage visual style, but felt the game was too short. Some critics noted {{the absence of any}} narrative or backstory, but felt that the game ultimately didn't need one, though GameSpot noted it as one of the game's weaknesses.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>And</b> <b>Yet</b> <b>It</b> Moves was {{originally}} designed to be played with digital controls, the Wii Remote's analog motion controls needed to be implemented such that they felt natural and not intrusive. Broken Rules determined, following a number of tests, that allowing the player to freely rotate to any degree best suited motion controls; originally the player could only rotate in 90 degree intervals. Four different control schemes were implemented to satisfy a wide number of players, three of which either use motion control or the Wii Remote pointer. While the file size limit imposed on WiiWare games was not an issue, the visuals needed to be downsampled to cohere with the Wii hardware. A standard-definition television was used in development; Bohatsch felt the visuals looked nicer on the SDTV than on a PC or Mac with higher display resolution, but warned that some HDTVs might not upsample the Wii resolution properly, recommending that a component cable be used while playing the game. The online leaderboards were omitted from the Wii version because the PC version's leaderboards were not frequently used. Three new levels, unlocked when the player completes the main campaign mode, were added. The near {{final version of the}} game was submitted to Nintendo's Quality Assurance team in May 2010 to inspect and find bugs. <b>And</b> <b>Yet</b> <b>It</b> Moves was released on the Wii Shop Channel in North America on August 23, 2010 and then in Europe on August 27.|$|E

6000|$|... "There {{you have}} it, Amanda. It's rant, perhaps. Sometimes I feel <b>it's</b> rant. <b>And</b> <b>yet</b> <b>it's</b> {{the breath of}} life to me.... There you are.... At last I've been able to break silence and tell you...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] said Milly, [...] "it's not that. It's not indeed. It's joy. It's {{wonder that}} you should think it {{necessary}} {{to ask me to}} forgive so little, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>it's</b> pleasure that you do." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{final results}} of the Italian {{campaign}} were limited {{in terms of the}} advantages gained by the Empire. The city of Ancona became a Byzantine base in Italy, accepting the Emperor as sovereign. The Normans of Sicily had been damaged and now came to terms with the Empire, ensuring peace for the rest of Manuel's reign. The Empire's ability to get involved in Italian affairs had been demonstrated. However, given the enormous quantities of gold which had been lavished on the project, it also demonstrated the limits of what money and diplomacy alone could achieve. The expense of Manuel's involvement in Italy must have cost the treasury a great deal (probably more than 2,160,000 hyperpyra or 30,000 pounds of gold), <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> produced only limited solid gains.|$|E
5|$|The {{levels in}} <b>And</b> <b>Yet</b> <b>It</b> Moves are {{designed}} such that spinning {{the world at}} certain moments is required to progress. Because the character will tear into pieces if he falls from too high a distance, the player must often spin the world such that the character can safely surmount or descend from large obstacles. Other hazards such as wild beasts, fire and boulders, or falling into the black void that borders the playing field will tear the character. However, the player has unlimited lives and will reappear at the last checkpoint he passed prior to being torn.|$|E

25|$|Since {{ancient times}} humans have been {{consciously}} aware of stress inside materials. Until the 17th century {{the understanding of}} stress was largely intuitive and empirical; <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> resulted in some surprisingly sophisticated technology, like the composite bow and glass blowing.|$|E
25|$|Some {{think that}} if a small child dies this must be borne with equanimity; if it {{is still in its}} cradle there should not even be a lament. <b>And</b> <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> is from the latter that nature has more cruelly demanded back the gift she had given.|$|E
25|$|John Levesque, Seattle Post-Intelligencer (April 20, 2001) â€” Like so many {{characters}} in noir-ish {{films of the}} 1940s and 1950s, Wolfe and Goodwin are ebulliently over the top: loud, proud and full of themselves. It's a bit much for anyone expecting the less theatrical performances of today. <b>And</b> <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> fits remarkably well with today's reality programming. Wolfe, after all, is ruder than anyone on Survivor.|$|E

25|$|Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress is {{an allegory}} of {{personal}} salvation and {{a guide to}} the Christian life. Instead of any focus on eschatology or divine retribution, Bunyan instead writes about how the individual saint can prevail against the temptations of mind and body that threaten damnation. The book is written in a straightforward narrative and shows influence from both drama and biography, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> also shows an awareness of the allegorical tradition found in Edmund Spenser.|$|E
25|$|Enamel is as brittle as glass <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> can {{constantly}} withstand bite forces during chewing {{as high as}} 1,000 N {{many times}} a day. As such, it has been argued, that enamel tufts {{is an example of}} how nature has created a biomechanical solution to the problem of weak internal interfaces that laminate structures would otherwise have. The solutions involved (such as filling growing defects with fluids) has inspired scientists to make novel bioinspired (or biomimicry) materials.|$|E
25|$|Sanderstead {{appears in}} the Domesday Book of 1086 as Sandestede, and {{belonging}} to St Peter's Abbey, Winchester. It had a total household population of 26 including 21 villagers, 4 slaves and 1 cottager. Its Domesday assets were assessed as 5 hides, and 10 carucates of arable land. It had 9 ploughs and wood worth 30 hogs. Its Domesday entry records that {{in the time of}} Edward the Confessor it was valued at 100 shillings, and now 12 pounds; <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> produces 15 pounds.|$|E

25|$|Thai Laksa: ,(Siam Laksa) The Thai laksa {{is quite}} common dish in Southern Thailand; the dish is {{probably}} influenced by its neighbor the Malaysian laksa lemak or curry laksa. Thai laksa employs red curry paste, chicken broth and coconut milk, hence it can be categorized as curry laksa, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> demonstrate some similar traits of Thai favourite tom yum goong, such as generous amount of lemongrass, prawns and button mushrooms. Thai laksa uses rice noodles, garlic, lemongrass, ginger, red curry paste, chicken stock, soy sauce, sugar, coconut milk, prawns, button mushrooms, spinach, lime juice, coriander and onions.|$|E
25|$|Igor Gouzenko, a cipher {{clerk in}} Soviet embassy in Ottawa, {{defected}} in 1945 {{with a mass}} of documents, one of {{which led to the}} arrest of Alan Nunn May for spying. Philby recommended that Hollis rather than Archer should be sent to Canada to interview Gouzenko although he knew Archer would be better able to do the job. Agreeing this, MI5 sent Hollis <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> was Philby at SIS who was apprised of progress and who altered, delayed and omitted messages before passing them on to MI5. By these means, Philby stopped Archer from having any involvement in the case.|$|E
25|$|One {{problem that}} had not been solved was {{atmospheric}} reentry. It had been shown that an orbital vehicle easily had enough kinetic energy to vaporize itself, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> was known that meteorites can make it down to the ground. The mystery was solved in the US in 1951 when H. Julian Allen and A. J. Eggers, Jr. of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) made the counterintuitive discovery that a blunt shape (high drag) permitted the most effective heat shield. With this type of shape, around 99% of the energy goes into the air rather than the vehicle, and this permitted safe recovery of orbital vehicles.|$|E
