The performance of these composites was analyzed in terms of the tensile, flexural, and impact properties and hardness measurements, and the properties were found to increase with increase in filler content. The scanning electron microscopy studies revealed that filler dispersion is good even at higher loadings. The dielectric strength, <b>arc</b> <b>resistance,</b> and <b>heat</b> distortion temperature of both mica- and microsilica-filled PEEK and PES composites are found to have better performance compared to unfilled polymers. Mica filler is found to be a better filler for PEEK than silica, while silica imparts better properties for PES than mica does...|$|R

40|$|Generally {{there are}} two {{different}} methods in calculation short-circuit currents in power system networks in terms of considering <b>arc</b> <b>resistance</b> in calculations, first method is based on considering the value of the <b>arc</b> <b>resistance</b> as a constant value (usually 0. 5 O) or neglecting this value. By introducing some formulae for the <b>arc</b> <b>resistance</b> like the Warrington formula {{which is one of the}} most well-known formulae second method could be applied. Second method is based on considering the value of the <b>arc</b> <b>resistance</b> in short-circuit calculation. To calculate the short-circuit current in power system networks our model should be accurate enough, to have an accurate model in theses studies the value of the <b>arc</b> <b>resistance</b> should be considered.
