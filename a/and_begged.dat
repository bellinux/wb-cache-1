5|$|The king, {{shocked and}} dejected, {{returned}} to the palace since he had already anointed his son, Devavrata, as heir apparent. Devavrata was distressed by his father's condition; he learned about the promise asked by the fisherman-chief from a minister. Immediately, Devavrata rushed to the hut of the fisherman-chief <b>and</b> <b>begged</b> for Satyvati's hand on his father's behalf. The fisherman repeated his condition and told Devavrata that only Shantanu was worthy of Satyavati; he had rejected marriage proposals from even Brahmarishis like Asita.|$|E

5|$|At 10:23, {{the judge}} raised a {{security}} alarm. Judicial officers, {{and a federal}} police officer {{who was in the}} court building testifying in an unrelated case, arrived at the scene; however, during the ongoing commotion the police officer mistook Okaz for the attacker and shot him in the upper leg. Wiens collapsed and was apprehended after one of the judges pointed out that not Okaz but Wiens was the assailant. While under arrest, Wiens resisted <b>and</b> <b>begged</b> the police officer to shoot him dead. Okaz, critically wounded in the stabbing attack, was in a coma for two days. He was subsequently treated for several weeks in a hospital near Dresden for the stabbing and shooting injuries. El-Sherbini died in the court building at 11:07, succumbing to her injuries.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{believed}} that her daughter's mere presence would help calm the opposition. Accompanied by Garai and a modest following, she and Mary {{set out for}} Đakovo. However, Elizabeth had seriously misjudged the situation. On 25 July 1386, they were ambushed en route and attacked by John Horvat in Gorjani. Their small entourage failed to fight off the attackers. Garai was killed by the rebels and his head was sent to Charles's widow Margaret, while the queens were imprisoned in the bishop of Zagreb's castle of Gomnec. Elizabeth took all blame for the rebellion <b>and</b> <b>begged</b> the attackers to spare her daughter's life.|$|E
5|$|He {{joined the}} Blue Cuirassier {{regiment}} {{of the imperial}} Russian cavalry shortly before 1903. Grand Duke Michael, the younger brother of Tsar Nicholas II, was the regiment's honorary colonel. In April 1903, during a military parade at the Pavlovsk Palace, Grand Duchess Olga, the youngest sister of Nicholas and Michael, saw Kulikovsky <b>and</b> <b>begged</b> Michael to arrange the seating at a casual luncheon so that she and Kulikovsky were adjacent. The Grand Duchess was already married to Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg, who was covertly believed by {{his friends and family}} to be homosexual. A few days after her brief meeting with Kulikovsky, Olga asked Oldenburg for a divorce, which he refused with the qualification that he would reconsider his decision after seven years.|$|E

5|$|Peel {{had gained}} a {{reputation}} for trying new methods within the industry, {{being one of the}} first textile manufacturers to use carding cylinders. He began experimenting at his home with different forms of printing until, according to family tradition, his young daughter Anne brought him a sprig of parsley <b>and</b> <b>begged</b> him {{to use it as a}} pattern. He etched this design onto a pewter plate to allow the printing, which was then finished with an iron by one of the women of the household. There are other versions of the tale, which dispute whether the experiments happened at the farm at Peel Fold or his house in Fish Lane and suggest a poor neighbour, Mrs. Milton, calendered the cloth to finish it.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} largely {{accepted her}} proposal. The Charity School Spelling Book was printed first {{and was the}} most widely used. It {{was one of the}} first children's books for the poor that was small but still had large type and large margins (features often considered appropriate only for books for more privileged readers). The stories themselves were also innovative: they emphasized the ordinary lives of ordinary children—"these children climbed trees, played with fire, threw cricket bats at sheep <b>and</b> <b>begged</b> in the streets". The book was adopted by Andrew Bell around 1800 for his Madras system of education and by various educational societies throughout Britain and its colonies; it was even used to educate adult slaves in Antigua and Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|When Nobin {{returned}} to the village, he learned about the affair from village gossip. Nobin was publicly humiliated following {{the discovery of the}} affair.

However, the mahant did not allow the couple to escape; his goons blocked their way. Overcome with anger and jealousy, Nobin slit his wife's throat with a fish knife, decapitating her, on 27 May 1873. Full of remorse, Nobin surrendered to the local police station and confessed his crime.|$|E

5|$|Burchard, {{along with}} Marshal {{and other members}} of the chapter, were often opposed to the actions of their {{archbishop}}. They objected to the archbishop having given a large part of York's treasury towards Richard's ransom, and to some of the archiepiscopal appointments in the church of York. Burchard and the others charged Geoffrey with simony, extortion, and neglect of his duties and the archbishop in return excommunicated the ringleaders more than once, and locked the canons out of church. The disputes flared up in 1192, with Burchard facing an effort by Geoffrey to replace him in the treasurership with Hamo, but the dispute was resolved by the gift of a church to Hamo by Burchard and Hamo's relinquishing of any claim to the treasurership. At another dispute, Geoffrey had confiscated the revenues of Burchard's offices, along with the revenues of Marshal, Peter de Ros the Archdeacon of Carlisle, and the canons Hugh Murdac and Adam of Thornover. Geoffrey refused to restore the incomes unless the offenders came barefoot into York Minster <b>and</b> <b>begged</b> for the archbishop's forgiveness. This all but Marshal did and they had their official revenues restored.|$|E
5|$|The Kurma Purana goes on {{to state}} that after the {{encounter}} with the sages of the Deodar Forest, Bhikshatana continued to wander, visiting various countries of gods and demons before he finally reached the abode of the god Vishnu. Vishnu's gatekeeper Vishvaksena did not allow him to enter. Angered, Bhikshatana slew Vishvaksena and impaled the corpse on his trident, which added to his sin. This form of Shiva with a corpse on his trident is called Kankala-murti ("One with the skeleton"). Bhikshatana, now as Kankala-murti, entered Vishnu's abode <b>and</b> <b>begged</b> for food. Vishnu offered his own blood as food in one version. In another version, Vishnu cut an artery on Bhikshatana's forehead; a stream of blood spurts into his begging bowl as his food. Vishnu then directed Bhikshatana to visit the sacred city of Varanasi, where his sin would be expiated. The encounter with Vishnu's gatekeeper is also retold with some variation in the Vamana Purana and the Matsya Purana.|$|E
5|$|The conversion, said Belhaven, {{would enable}} James Francis Edward's {{accession}} to the English throne upon William III's death. The Queen-Regent was not swayed by Belhaven's argument, so a compromise was reached: James Francis Edward, if he became King, {{would limit the}} number of Roman Catholic priests in England and promise not to tamper with the established Church of England. In exchange, the confederate Lords would do all in their power to block the passing of the Hanoverian succession in Scottish parliament. When, in March 1702, William III died, Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat, declared for James Francis Edward at Inverness. Soon after, Lovat travelled to the court-in-exile at Saint-Germain, <b>and</b> <b>begged</b> the Queen-Regent to allow her son to come to Scotland. Lovat intended to raise an army of 15,000 soldiers in Scotland, to seize the throne for James Francis Edward. Mary refused to part with James Francis Edward, and the rising failed. Mary's regency ceased with her son's reaching of the age of 16.|$|E

30|$|The antioxidative or antiperoxidative {{properties}} of ME, VO and their fractions TQ and LMN in rats {{are associated with}} multiple mechanisms. As we {{are well aware of}} atherogenic suspension that induces oxidative stress and increases the susceptibility of membrane lipids to oxidation. Oxidative stress results from deviation from equilibrium between antioxidant and oxidant systems. HMG-CoA reductase an important rate-limiting enzyme regulates cholesterol level. As in our previous experiments, administration of ME, VO and their TQ and LMN fractions in atherogenic suspension fed rats, the activity of HMG-CoA reductase was effectively decreased when compared to NLP-C rats (Ahmad <b>and</b> <b>Beg</b> 2013 a; Ahmad <b>and</b> <b>Beg</b> 2013 b). Reduced activity of HMG-CoA reductase was apparently due to involved in two related mechanisms: suppression of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase mRNA expression and enhanced low-density lipoproteins (LDL) receptor gene, as reported by Al-Naqeep et al. (2009) in rats treated with thymoquinone rich fraction. Such hypolipidmic regulation of these test fractions and pure compounds is apparently involved in reduction in lipid peroxidation. This hypothesis is also supported by our previous experiments that are significant mitigating role of administration of these test fractions and compounds in the reduction of CD and MDA products from LDL and its subfractions, sd-LDL and lb-LDL (Ahmad et al. 2013), and plasma was reported in atherogenic suspension fed rats (Ahmad <b>and</b> <b>Beg</b> 2013 a; Ahmad <b>and</b> <b>Beg</b> 2013 b; Ahmad <b>and</b> <b>Beg</b> 2013 c).|$|R
