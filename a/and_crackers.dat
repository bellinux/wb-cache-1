5|$|The player rallies {{the four}} factions to attack FizzCo headquarters, and {{attempts}} to destroy FizzCo HQ by riding a giant bottle of OCD into it (reminiscent of Dr. Strangelove). The player is killed in the blast, and the factions mourn them. However, the player stops the credits rolling after this scene to complain how depressing the ending is, and decides to change it. The player survives in this ending, and it is revealed that the FizzCo building is a robot that is meant to destroy the city {{to cover up the}} OCD outbreak. The player destroys the robot and has milk <b>and</b> <b>crackers</b> with the other survivors. After the credits, however, computers in the FizzCo headquarters automatically activate a protocol sending FizzCo helicopters full of OCD around the world.|$|E

2500|$|Carbohydrate {{consumed}} in food yields 3.87 calories of energy per gram for simple sugars, and 3.57 to 4.12 calories per gram for complex carbohydrate {{in most other}} foods. Relatively high levels of carbohydrate are associated with processed foods or refined foods made from plants, including sweets, cookies and candy, table sugar, honey, soft drinks, breads <b>and</b> <b>crackers,</b> jams and fruit products, pastas and breakfast cereals. Lower amounts of carbohydrate are usually associated with unrefined foods, including beans, tubers, rice, and unrefined fruit. [...] Animal-based foods generally have the lowest carbohydrate levels, although milk does contain {{a high proportion of}} lactose.|$|E
2500|$|For dental health, {{frequency}} of sugar intake {{is more important}} than the amount of sugar consumed. [...] In the presence of sugar and other carbohydrates, bacteria in the mouth produce acids that can demineralize enamel, dentin, and cementum. [...] The more frequently teeth are exposed to this environment, the more likely dental caries is to occur. [...] Therefore, minimizing snacking is recommended, since snacking creates a continuous supply of nutrition for acid-creating bacteria in the mouth. [...] Also, chewy and sticky foods (such as candy, cookies, potato chips, <b>and</b> <b>crackers)</b> tend to adhere to teeth longer. However, dried fruits such as raisins and fresh fruit such as apples and bananas disappear from the mouth quickly, and do not appear to be a risk factor. For children, the American Dental Association and the European Academy of Paediatric Dentistry recommend limiting the {{frequency of}} consumption of drinks with sugar, and not giving baby bottles to infants during sleep (see earlier discussion). [...] Mothers are also recommended to avoid sharing utensils and cups with their infants to prevent transferring bacteria from the mother's mouth.|$|E
