5|$|The {{unitary state}} {{was not an}} end in itself, but a means to higher ends. The {{republic}} had been in dire financial straits even before the revolution of 1795. The system of public finance {{that had been the}} envy of the world in its Golden Age, enabling it to throw far beyond its weight in world politics up to the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, had become a millstone around its neck. By 1713 the public debt of the province of Holland had reached 310 million guilders; the debt of the Generality was 68 million; and the debts of the smaller provinces, and of the cities came on top of this. The debt service of Holland <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> year required 14 million guilders, which exceeded its regular tax revenue. Most of this humongous public debt was held by Dutch private citizens, so in a sense it merely engendered an internal money circuit in the Dutch economy. However, it was mostly concentrated {{in the hands of the}} rentier class, while the debt was serviced by mainly regressive taxes that weighed on the working population. Most importantly, these were taxes levied by the individual provinces, who serviced their own debt, and paid into the Generality coffers according to a repartition schedule last changed in 1616. Attempts to reform this structure during the 18th century were mainly fruitless.|$|E
25|$|In The Efficacy of Musical Emotions Provoked by Mozart's Music for the Reconciliation of Cognitive Dissonance (2012), {{a variant}} of the forbidden-toy paradigm, {{indicated}} that listening to music reduces the development of cognitive dissonance. Without music in the background, the control group of four-year-old children were told to avoid playing with a forbidden toy. After playing alone, the control-group children later devalued the importance of the forbidden toy; however, in the variable group, classical music played in the background, while the children played <b>alone.</b> <b>In</b> <b>that</b> group, the children did not later devalue the forbidden toy. The researchers, Nobuo Masataka and Leonid Perlovsky, concluded that music might inhibit cognitions that reduce cognitive dissonance.|$|E
500|$|Having {{initially}} {{been less}} well received by theatre critics {{and at the}} box office than another 2013 Broadway production, Matilda the Musical, Kinky Boots entered the 2013 awards season as an underdog. However, {{less than a month after}} opening, Kinky Boots surpassed this rival with audiences in weekly box office gross and later enjoyed a post-Tony boost in advance sales. [...] The production earned a season-high 13 nominations and 6 Tony wins, including Best Musical and Best Score for Lauper in her first outing as a Broadway songwriter, making her the first woman to win <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> category. The musical's cast album premiered at number one on the Billboard Cast Albums Chart and number fifty-one on the Billboard 200 chart. In 2016, it won three Laurence Olivier Awards, including Best New Musical.|$|E

Idolator editor Mike Wass felt the vocal ensemble performed a [...] "rousing rendition" [...] of the song at Sydney's Hordern Pavilion and noted, [...] "Louis [...] described it as his favourite song on Up All Night and he's not <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> opinion if the swooning girls in the audience are any indication". Herald Sun writer Cameron Adams opined that the performance of [...] "Moments" [...] at Melbourne's Hisense Arena showcased the group's [...] "strong pop voices". Erica Futterman for Rolling Stone assessed that {{the performance of the}} track at New York City's Beacon Theatre was the most tender moment of the show.

500|$|Lo {{found the}} {{shooting}} difficult and exhausting {{because she had}} to walk around with a 22-pound camera strapped around her waist for the three days of the filming. She also stated that it was [...] "draining" [...] to represent the pain she felt when she wrote the track. At one point during the filming, Lo was drunk and tired, so {{she decided to go}} into the bathroom stall; concerning this, the singer confessed that: [...] "I was wasted and tired and it was a tough recording and I really just went into the bathroom and sat there by myself. There weren't any people around then and I was just really <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> stall. I just sat there and thought of anything that was happening during that time. The tears just came." [...] She also confessed that she barely remembered half of the recording. On 19 February 2014, she posted a teaser of the video on her Facebook account. On 17 March 2014, the music video was released via Lo's VEVO channel on YouTube, and was made available for consumption on the iTunes Store the next day.|$|E
500|$|Kinky Boots {{received}} a season-high 13 Tony Award nominations. Matilda, which The New York Times {{described as the}} [...] "unalloyed critical hit" [...] of the season, received 12 nominations, 11 {{of them in the}} same categories as Kinky Boots. In addition to its critical success, Matilda had won the Drama Desk Award for outstanding musical and had set a record by winning the most Olivier Awards in history. Nevertheless, Kinky Boots won a season-high six Tonys, including Best Musical, which the press described as an upset, and Lauper's win for Best Score made her the first woman to win <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> category. The creative team are Americans, and reviewer David Cote, an American writing in The Guardian, judged that the show's win was a case of [...] "the balance of love going to a homegrown American musical, Kinky Boots, over the British import Matilda." [...] The other Tony wins were for best actor (Porter), sound design (Shivers), choreography (Mitchell) and orchestrations (Oremus). [...] Fierstein, Sands, Ashford, Mitchell (as director) and the three other designers were all nominated but did not win. Kinky Boots also won the 2013 Artios Award for Outstanding Achievement in Casting in the Broadway musical category.|$|E

2500|$|Intended to {{coincide}} with protests in Karachay–Cherkessia, Circassian youth groups held mass [...] "national protests" [...] in Kabardino-Balkaria on 17 November 2009. It was attended by about 3000 people (considering that it {{was limited to the}} city of Nal'chik and the small population of the republic's Circassian population alone, let <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> city, this is a huge figure). Ibragim Yagan, a leader of a Circassian NGO posted a video on Facebook. It featured him standing under both the flag of the Russian Federation and the Circassian national flag, called upon all Circassian youth to wake up to claim their rights and historic lands. He said that [...] "We have been constantly watched, followed, blackmailed for our political activities... But we cannot lose anymore, because we have already lost everything." [...] Yagan is then drowned out by a wave of cheers.|$|E
