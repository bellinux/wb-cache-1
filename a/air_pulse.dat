50|$|The ocular {{response}} analyser (ORA) is a non-contact (air puff) tonometer {{that does}} not require topical anaesthesia and provides additional information on the biomechanical properties of the cornea. It uses an <b>air</b> <b>pulse</b> to deform the cornea into a slight concavity. The difference between the pressures at which the cornea flattens inward and outward {{is measured by the}} machine and termed corneal hysteresis (CH). The machine uses this value to correct for the effects of the cornea on measurement.|$|E
50|$|Non-contact {{tonometry}} (or air-puff tonometry) {{is different}} from pneumatonometry and was invented by Bernard Grolman of Reichert, Inc (formerly American Optical). It uses a rapid <b>air</b> <b>pulse</b> to applanate (flatten) the cornea. Corneal applanation is detected via an electro-optical system. Intraocular pressure is estimated by detecting {{the force of the}} air jet at the instance of applanation. Historically, non-contact tonometers were not considered to be an accurate way to measure IOP but instead a fast and simple way to screen for high IOP. However, modern non-contact tonometers have been shown to correlate well with Goldmann tonometry measurements and are particularly useful for measuring IOP in children and other non-compliant patient groups.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} improve the {{separation}} efficiency in the air-solid phase, we proposed an innovative separation method called the active <b>pulsing</b> <b>air</b> classifier, which produce <b>pulsing</b> <b>air</b> by a <b>pulsing</b> <b>air</b> generator. In this way, the particles received a new acceleration action in each pulsing period, and then, it obtains a better performance than non-pulsing air separators in the laboratory scale. The dynamic equation of the motion particle in the active pulsing airflow was built up, showing that a higher density particle may get a small acceleration. The simulation results of airflow field show that the airflow turbulence acceleration will disperse the particles and a density dominant separation can be achieved. All high density particles, low density particles, and dust of waste catalyst can be acquired by the active <b>pulsing</b> <b>air</b> classifier. When the airflow velocity is 3. 33 m/s, the frequency of <b>air</b> <b>pulsing</b> is 7 / 3 Hz, the separation efficiency of the active <b>pulsing</b> <b>air</b> classifier reaches its maximum: 97. 63 %.

The filters were installed in a specially designed filter housing with a reverse air-pulse cleaning system for automatically cleaning the filters in-place. Previous tests conducted on the same filters and housing at LLNL under controlled conditions using Arizona road dust showed good cleanability with reverse <b>air</b> <b>pulses.</b> Two high efficiency steel filters, containing 64 pleated cartridge elements housed in the standard 2 {prime} x 2 {prime} {times} l{prime} HEPA frame, were evaluated in the filter test housing using a 1, 000 cfm slip stream containing {{a high concentration of}} depleted uranium oxide dust. One filter had the pleated cartridges manufactured to the authors specifications by the Pall Corporation and the other by Memtec Corporation. Test results showed both filters had a rapid increase in pressure drop with time, and reverse <b>air</b> <b>pulses</b> could not decrease the pressure drop. The authors suspected moisture accumulation in the filters was the problem since there were heavy rains during the evaluations, and the pressure drop of the Memtec filter decreased dramatically after passing clean, dry air through the filter and after the filter sat idle for one week. Subsequent laboratory tests on a single filter cartridge confirmed that water accumulation in the filter was responsible for the increase in filter pressure drop and the inability to lower the pressure drop by reverse <b>air</b> <b>pulses.</b> No effort was made to identify the source of the water accumulation and correct the problem because the available funds were exhausted...|$|R
50|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, {{primarily}} due to work with sensory testing performed by gastroenterologists (stomach doctors) and pulmonologists (lung doctors), sensory testing and FEESST {{have been shown to}} have additional applications beyond assessing swallowing function. For example, people with acid reflux disease, especially those with Throatburn Reflux usually have swollen vocal cords due to years of acid damage. Untreated acid-injured vocal cords will not have as sharp reflexes as vocal cords that are not swollen. Therefore, aspiration is common in people with chronic acid reflux disease. Sensory testing can quantify and assess the swelling for better treatment. The strength of the <b>air</b> <b>pulse</b> given during sensory testing in acid-injured vocal cords due to acid reflux disease will necessarily be much greater in order to elicit an airway reflex than tissues that are not swollen.|$|E
50|$|During the <b>air</b> <b>pulse</b> {{administration}} part of {{the test}} it is determined if the reflex (LAR) that initiates the swallow is being responsive enough. The responsiveness depends {{on the ability of}} the vagus nerve to feel so that it can properly send the impulse to the brain to initiate the LAR. If there is any injury or swelling of the vagus nerve, the sensation will be diminished. As a result, the reflex responsible for protecting the airway will be affected. During sensory testing {{it has been shown that}} a much stronger stimulus is necessary to elicit the LAR if there is any desensitization to the vagus nerve. The second {{part of the}} FEESST test involves giving food to the patient and tracking where the food travels in the throat region. Green food coloring is typically given in the food to track the food as it travels along the natural pink-colored tissues of the throat.|$|E

The sampling system consists of an aluminum housing that incorporates two 30 -cm 3 preevacuated glass vials with rubber septums. Upon actuation, the sampling probe needle is driven through the septum with a pressurized <b>air</b> <b>pulse,</b> filling the tube with gas and dust from the mine explosion.
