5000|$|Suppressor {{mutations}} {{also occur}} in genes that code for virus structural proteins. To create a viable phage T4 virus (see image), {{a balance of}} structural components is required. An amber mutant of phage T4 contains a mutation that changes a codon for an amino acid in a protein to the nonsense stop codon TAG (see stop codon and nonsense mutation). If, upon infection, an amber mutant defective in a gene encoding a needed structural component of phage T4 is weakly suppressed (in an E. coli host containing a specific altered tRNA - see nonsense suppressor), it will produce a reduced number of the needed structural component. As a consequence few if any viable phage are formed. However, {{it was found that}} viable phage could sometimes be produced in the host with the weak nonsense suppressor if a second <b>amber</b> <b>mutation</b> in a gene that encodes another structural protein is also present in the phage genome. [...] It was found that the reason the second <b>amber</b> <b>mutation</b> could suppress the first one is that the two numerically reduced structural proteins would now be in balance. For instance, if the first <b>amber</b> <b>mutation</b> caused a reduction of tail fibers to one tenth the normal level, most phage particles produced would have insufficient tail fibers to be infective. However, if a second <b>amber</b> <b>mutation</b> is defective in a base plate component and causes one tenth the number of base plates to be made, this may restore the balance of tail fibers and base plates, and thus allow infective phage to be produced.|$|E
5000|$|Viruses with amber {{mutations}} {{are characterized}} by their ability to infect only certain strains of bacteria, known as amber suppressors. These bacteria carry their own mutation that allows a recovery of function in the mutant viruses.

One type corresponding to the true revertant A 1 leads to G, and the other to the second site revertants C 81 leads to U (A 1 U 81). The A 1 U 81 revertant has been shown to insert both glutamine and tyrosine at the site of <b>amber</b> <b>mutation.</b> Only true revertants (G 82 leads to A) were obtained when su+ 3 G 82 was analyzed.

One of these mutants was again treated, and a strain was isolated in which tetracycline resistance was also lost due to an <b>amber</b> <b>mutation</b> in the plasmid. The plasmid containing amber mutations in the genes amp and tet was named pLM 2. This plasmid could be transferred to strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. phaseolicola, and P. pseudoalcaligenes.

Five different members of the tRNATrp gene family were identified as suppressors: sup- 7 X, sup- 5 III, sup- 24 IV, sup- 28 X, and sup- 29 IV. All five suppressor genes were sequenced and found to encode identical tRNA(UAGTrp) molecules with a single base change (CCA to CTA) at the anticodon compared with their wild-type counterparts.

The relative expression of these five genes was determined by measuring the efficiencies of suppressers against <b>amber</b> <b>mutations</b> in genes affecting the nervous system, hypodermis, muscle, and sex determination.

40|$|Bacteriophage T 4 DNA {{replication}} initiates from origins at early {{times of}} infection and from recombinational intermediates as the infection progresses. Plasmids containing cloned T 4 origins replicate during T 4 infection, providing a model system for studying origin-dependent replication. In addition, recombination-dependent replication {{can be analyzed}} by using cloned nonorigin fragments of T 4 DNA, which direct plasmid replication that requires phage-encoded recombination proteins. We have tested in vivo requirements for both plasmid replication model systems by infecting plasmid-containing cells with mutant phage. Replication of origin and nonorigin plasmids strictly required components of the T 4 DNA polymerase holoenzyme complex. Recombination-dependent plasmid replication also strictly required the T 4 single-stranded DNA-binding protein (gene product 32 [gp 32]), and replication of origin-containing plasmids was greatly reduced by 32 amber mutations. gp 32 is therefore important in both modes of replication. An <b>amber</b> <b>mutation</b> in gene 41, which encodes the replicative helicase of T 4, reduced but did not eliminate both recombination- and origin-dependent plasmid replication. Therefore, gp 41 may normally be utilized for replication of both plasmids but is apparently not required for either. An <b>amber</b> <b>mutation</b> in gene 61, which encodes the T 4 RNA primase, did not eliminate either recombination- or origin-dependent plasmid replication. However, plasmid replication was severely delayed by the 61 <b>amber</b> <b>mutation,</b> suggesting that the protein may normally play an important, though nonessential, role in replication. We deleted gene 61 from the T 4 genome to test whether the observed replication was due to residual gp 61 in the amber mutant infection.

Induction of the hybrid protein resulted in a rapid cessation of cell division which could be reversed by removing the lac inducer. This inhibition of division could be prevented by an increased gene dosage of ftsZ or {{the presence of the}} sulB allele of ftsZ, which is known to code for an altered but functional ftsZ protein. An increased gene dosage of ftsZ or the presence of the sulB allele of ftsZ is known to overcome sulA-mediated inhibition of division during the SOS response.

We report that the transcription of these osmoregulated ots genes is dependent on KatF (AppR), a putative sigma factor for certain stationary phase- and starvation-induced genes. The transcription of the osmoregulated bet and proU genes was not katF dependent.

We have performed a molecular cloning of the otsBA genes, and we present evidence that they constitute an operon encoding trehalose- 6 -phosphate phosphatase and trehalose- 6 -phosphate synthase. A cloning and restriction site analysis, performed by comparing the cloned fragments with the known physical map of the E. coli chromosome, revealed that the otsBA genes are situated on a 2. 9 -kb HindIII fragment located 8 to 11 kb clockwise of tar (41. 6 min) ...|$|E

We report that E. coli K- 12 and W 1485 (sup 0) accumulated trehalose but that they required a higher osmotic strength in the growth medium than that required by their sup+ derivatives.

The much-used sup 0 strain MC 4100 behaved like the sup+ derivatives of W 1485 with respect to trehalose synthesis. treA mutants with a defective periplasmic trehalase accumulated trehalose extracellularly under osmotic stress. The amount of trehalose excreted correlated with their synthase activity. Strains with an intact trehalase did not display extracellular trehalose accumulation.

Strains carrying the glnA 3711 allele were unable to express nitrogen regulation of genes coding for histidase, asparaginase, and glutamate dehydrogenase unless amber suppressors were also present.

By using "primer-directed mutagenesis" on a Xenopus laevis tyrosine tRNA gene cloned into the recombinant single-strand phage M 13 mp 5, we have generated an amber suppressor tRNA gene that has a nucleotide change [...] GTA leads to CTA [...] in the anticodon sequence. The suppressor (Su) tRNA gene was introduced into monkey kidney cells (CV- 1) by using simian virus 40 (SV 40) DNA as vector (SV 40 -tRNATyrSu+). CV- 1 cells infected with virus containing the mutant, but not the wild-type, tRNA gene produce a functional amber suppressor tRNA as indicated by suppression of <b>amber</b> <b>mutations</b> in co-infecting adenovirus serotype 2 -SV 40 hybrids. Further evidence that suppression of these <b>amber</b> <b>mutations</b> is tRNA mediated was derived by isolation of total tRNA from CV- 1 cells infected with the SV 40 -tRNATyr (Su+) recombinant and its use in demonstration of read through of an amber codon during in vitro translation of tobacco mosaic virus RNA in reticulocyte extracts. Interestingly, the amplification of an amber suppressor gene in CV- 1 cells does not interfere with SV 40 production, suggesting that suppression of amber codons may not be very deleterious to mammalian cell metabolism...|$|R
