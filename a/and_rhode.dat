5|$|After Duquesne lost to Saint Bonaventure, the Bonnies {{also lost}} their final regular season game to Xavier, which left {{the two teams}} in a tie for the eighth seed and the home tournament game that went with it. The two teams had played each other twice during the season, with each team taking one victory, so the second tiebreaker came down to who had scored the best victory. Duquesne's best win came against Charlotte, while Saint Bonaventure's was against Rhode Island. Unfortunately, those two teams were also in a tie. So for Duquesne to get their home game, Charlotte had to win their final home game, <b>and</b> <b>Rhode</b> Island had to lose. Both teams lost, so the tie {{remained}} <b>and</b> <b>Rhode</b> Island won out due to their head-to-head records. Thus Duquesne would head {{back out on the}} road against the Bonnies.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, Massachusetts was {{estimated}} to be the third-most densely populated U.S. state, with 839.4 people per square mile, behind New Jersey <b>and</b> <b>Rhode</b> Island. In 2014, Massachusetts had 1,011,811foreign-born residents or 15% of the population.|$|E

5|$|When {{the federal}} {{government}} began operations under the new form of government on March 4, 1789, two (of the 13) states were ineligible to participate as they had not yet ratified the Constitution.

5|$|Although Lincoln {{won only}} a {{plurality}} of the popular vote, his victory {{in the electoral college}} was decisive: Lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123. There were fusion tickets in which all of Lincoln's opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York, New Jersey, <b>and</b> <b>Rhode</b> Island, but even if the anti-Lincoln vote had been combined in every state, Lincoln still would have won a majority in the Electoral College.|$|E
5|$|As Ophelia was {{predicted}} to pass near southeast New England, the NHC issued tropical storm warnings {{for much of}} the south Massachusetts <b>and</b> <b>Rhode</b> Island coastlines. In Atlantic Canada, considerable preparations were taken for Ophelia, primarily because of memories of Hurricane Juan of the 2003 season, which had caught the authorities off-guard. Ophelia prompted the Canadian Hurricane Centre's first ever tropical storm warnings which were canceled when Ophelia became extratropical.|$|E

The first French fleet attempted landings in New York <b>and</b> <b>Rhode</b> Island, but ultimately failed to engage British forces during 1778. In 1779, a fleet commanded by Vice Admiral Charles Henri, comte d'Estaing assisted American forces attempting to recapture Savvanah, Georgia.|$|E

5|$|The {{remnants}} of Nicole, {{combined with the}} extratropical storm, produced strong winds in New England, with gusts of up to 65mph (105km/h). In Maine, the winds snapped branches off trees, and also downed trees and power lines. Power outages were reported, primarily in coastal portions of Washington and Hancock Counties. Nicole produced moderate swells along the East Coast of the United States. Conditions for surfing were best in New York <b>and</b> <b>Rhode</b> Island, where swells of over 4feet (1.2m) occurred.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-two {{other state}} names derive from European languages: seven come from Latin (mostly from Latinate forms of English {{personal}} names, one coming from Welsh), five come from English, five come from Spanish (and one more from an Indigenous language {{by way of}} Spanish), and four come from French (one of these by way of English). The etymologies of six states are disputed or unclear: Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Oregon, <b>and</b> <b>Rhode</b> Island (in the table below, those states have one row for each potential source language or meaning).|$|E
5|$|Commodore Hopkins {{came under}} {{scrutiny}} from Congress over matters unrelated to this action. He had violated his written orders by sailing to Nassau instead of Virginia and the Carolinas, {{and he had}} distributed the goods taken during the cruise to Connecticut <b>and</b> <b>Rhode</b> Island without consulting Congress. He was censured for these transgressions, and dismissed from the Navy in January 1778 after further controversies, including the fleet's failure to sail agayn (a number of its ships suffered from crew shortages, and also became trapped at Providence by the British occupation of Newport late in 1776). American forces were {{not strong enough to}} dislodge the British garrison there, which was also supported by British ships using Newport as a base.|$|E

Idaho also has the greatest percent of its land in national forests with 38.2%, followed by Oregon with 24.7% and Colorado with 20.9%.

5|$|From Gallery Place – Chinatown through Judiciary Square, {{the line}} runs southeast, turning east again at D Street to reach Union Station. There it turns north and {{surfaces}} adjacent to Union Station's platforms, follows the Washington Terminal yard tracks north to Brentwood {{where the line}} turns northwestward and again joins CSX Transportation's Metropolitan Subdivision tracks, running in a unique gauntlet arrangement with the freight railroad tracks straddling the Metro tracks. The Red Line continues in this manner northwest across the District-Maryland line, through Takoma and past Silver Spring. It reenters a tunnel at 16th Street and heads north under Georgia Avenue to the end at Glenmont. There is a maintenance yard between the NoMa <b>and</b> <b>Rhode</b> Island Avenue stops.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Bob's {{arrival in}} New England, {{officials}} in Connecticut <b>and</b> <b>Rhode</b> Island {{declared a state}} of emergency in anticipation of significant damage. All state workers in the area were told to go home early and prepare for the storm. The Connecticut Legislature canceled a session on the state's budget and Governor Lowell P. Weicker, Jr. activated the emergency operations center. Submarines stationed in Groton left port and waited out the storm under water. Airplane and train service was disrupted throughout the Mid-Atlantic states and New England in relation to Bob. The American Red Cross opened 23shelters in 16communities in Connecticut. In neighboring Rhode Island, the agency set up 40shelters, and there were an additional 25shelters unaffiliated with the agency. About 3,500people statewide evacuated, including 2,000 on Block Island. Several people injured themselves while preparing for the storm.|$|E
