5|$|Batista and Orton {{decided to}} work {{together}} to assault Bryan, and the original referee returned to the match. At ringside, Batista threw Bryan down with a Batista Bomb onto the Spanish announce table, while Orton immediately combined with an inverted version of his signature RKO maneuver. As both Bryan and Orton were sent through the Spanish announce table, only Batista emerged unscathed. Medical personnel arrived and carted Bryan away on a stretcher. Batista attacked Orton, who retaliated with a DDT onto the floor. Suddenly, Bryan got off the stretcher <b>and</b> <b>crawled</b> back to the ring, where he was set upon by Orton.|$|E
5|$|Amidst {{the flames}} and rubble, Arenberg's and Ferdinand's troops tried to storm the castle, but {{found their way}} blocked by masses of debris created by their own explosives. Furthermore, {{although}} close to half of the garrison had perished in the explosion and subsequent collapse of the fortifications, those who remained offered staunch resistance by throwing rocks on the approaching attackers, causing {{a large number of}} casualties. In frustration, 40 or 50 of the attackers tied together two ladders <b>and</b> <b>crawled</b> through the sluice-ways of the garderobe (latrines) that emptied on the hillside, thus gaining access to the interior of the castle. There they killed around 20 of the defenders in fierce fighting; the remaining defenders, approximately 70 men, among them Buchner and Sudermann, the garrison commander and his lieutenant, sought refuge in the castle's keep. In this way, Ferdinand's infantry at last gained unopposed access to the fortress. Storming the castle had taken about two hours.|$|E
5|$|The {{turning point}} in the war came when Burnham and Bonar Armstrong, a Company native commissioner, found their way through the Matopos Hills to a sacred cave not many miles from the Mangwe district, to a {{sanctuary}} then known only to the Matabele where Mlimo had been hiding. Not far from the cave was a village (now gone) of about 100 huts filled with many warriors. The two men tethered their horses to a thicket <b>and</b> <b>crawled</b> on their bellies, screening their slow, cautious movements by means of branches held before them. Once inside the cave, they waited until Mlimo entered. Mlimo was said to be about 60 years old, with very dark skin, sharp-featured; American news reports of the time described him as having a cruel, crafty look. Burnham and Armstrong waited until Mlimo entered the cave and started his dance of immunity, at which point Burnham shot Mlimo just below the heart, killing him.|$|E

5|$|In October 2016, Madonna {{announced}} plans of collaborating with Art Basel {{to revive the}} Tears of a Clown show, at a benefit gala on December 2, 2016 at Miami Beach's Faena Forum. The location was developed by Argentine hotelier and real estate developer, Alan Faena, and the show would coincide {{with the opening of}} the Forum. The concert was held along with an accompanying art auction and dinner, to benefit Madonna's Raising Malawi foundation to support their projects like Mercy James Pediatric Surgery Hospital in Malawi, as well as art and education initiatives for impoverished children in the country. Madonna herself auctioned some of her art collection, as well as never-before-seen pictures from her marriage to actor Sean Penn, photographed by Herb Ritts. Tickets were highly priced, at general admission of $5,000 with VIP meet-and-greet packages coming at $150,000. She also auctioned the flapper dress from Rebel Heart Tour, modelled by singer Ariana Grande during the show. Penn was present in the audience and bid on several items, and at one point handcuffed Madonna <b>and</b> <b>crawled</b> through her legs for generating a higher bid.|$|E
5|$|The Ustaše {{used the}} mysterious deaths {{of two of}} their local {{followers}} as a pretext for the killings. The victims were drawn from Gudovac and its surroundings on 28 April. Most were arrested under the guise that they were Serb rebels loyal to the ousted Yugoslav government. They were taken to a nearby field and collectively shot by a firing squad of up to 70 Ustaše guards. Five of the prisoners managed to survive the initial volley <b>and</b> <b>crawled</b> away to safety. The Ustaše forced Gudovac's surviving inhabitants to dig a mass grave for the victims and pour quicklime on the bodies to speed up decomposition. The following day, relatives {{of one of the}} victims informed the Germans of what had transpired. The Germans ordered a partial exhumation of the mass grave, and had 40 suspected perpetrators arrested. Mladen Lorković, a senior Ustaše official, used his influence to have the detained men released and promised German ambassador Siegfried Kasche that the Croatian authorities would carry out a thorough investigation. No investigation took place.|$|E

25|$|The {{field was}} named Gowen Field in 1941 on July 23, after 1st Lt Paul R. Gowen (1909–1938). Born {{and raised in}} Caldwell, he {{attended}} the University of Idaho for two years, then obtained an appointment to West Point in 1929, and graduated ninth in his class in 1933. While piloting a twin-engine B-10 bomber in the Army Air Corps, Gowen was killed instantly in a crash in Panama in July 1938.

25|$|In mid-December, Colonel Breytenbach's brother Cloete, a {{journalist}} for The Sunday Times, arrived in South West Africa to {{do a story}} on the war. He requested an opportunity to see the operational area and was permitted to photograph 32 Battalion in action as long as he refrained from publishing the unit's name or any details of its deployment. Cloete received his opportunity on 23 December, when an SADF supply convoy spotted suspicious tracks entering Ovamboland. A 32 Battalion member, Tony Viera, followed the tracks two kilometres into Angola and observed seven insurgents mingling with civilians north of Chapa Lupale. His platoon deployed around the fringe of the settlement <b>and</b> <b>crawled</b> to within seventy metres of the guerrillas. In the ensuing firefight six of the seven were shot dead.

500|$|... "Agua Mala" [...] {{was written}} by David Amann and was his second story for The X-Files after [...] "Terms of Endearment." [...] "Agua Mala" [...] went through several very {{different}} drafts. Amann was originally tasked with bringing back the character of Arthur Dales. His original story was of a monster loose in an abandoned gold mine. Frank Spotnitz, the show's executive producer, did not particularly {{like the idea of}} a gold mine, but he enjoyed the concept of a monster loose in an enclosed space. Amann quickly decided to set the episode during a hurricane and feature a sea monster as the primary antagonist. Originally, the sea monster was blown onto dry land <b>and</b> <b>crawled</b> into the building, before Amann decided to re-write it as living water.|$|E
500|$|In {{an initial}} German assault, Baskeyfield and his gun crews {{destroyed}} two tanks and a self-propelled gun as they advanced down the Acacialaan. [...] Baskeyfield allowed the armour to come within 100 yards of his positions before ordering his crews to fire, while paratroopers of the 11th Battalion in nearby houses dealt with attacking infantry. [...] In {{the course of}} this action, Baskeyfield's crew was killed or wounded and Baskeyfield himself was badly injured. [...] However he refused to be evacuated and in a later German attack he worked his gun alone, loading, laying and firing it himself. [...] He fired round after round until enemy fire put his gun out of action, <b>and</b> <b>crawled</b> to the second gun, whose crew had similarly been disabled. From here he engaged another self-propelled gun, dispatching it with two rounds, but was killed shortly afterwards by fire from another German tank.|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} my {{dissertation}} centers on how networks of neurons interact to generate {{behaviors in the}} medicinal leech. I used voltage-sensitive dye imaging to simultaneously record from large populations of individual neurons to ask three related questions: (1) When and in what neurons is the decision made to either swim or crawl {{in response to a}} sensory stimulus? (2) Can single neurons influence the decision between swimming <b>and</b> <b>crawling?</b> (3) Do the swimming <b>and</b> <b>crawling</b> central pattern generators (CPGs) exist as distinct neuronal circuits, or do they share some of the same circuitry in a multifunctional manner? The first question was addressed by analyzing population recordings of the time between when a stimulus is delivered and when the choice between swimming <b>and</b> <b>crawling</b> is made. The result of the analysis highlighted populations of neurons that discriminated between the two behaviors earlier than any single neuron. The second question was addressed by attempting to manipulate candidate decision-making neurons in this population. We found a neuron, cell 208, which was sufficient to bias the choice between swimming <b>and</b> <b>crawling</b> with intracellular current injection. Thus, cell 208 participates in the decision-making process. The third question was motivated by the need to understand how the two CPGs are organized. By recording ongoing swimming <b>and</b> <b>crawling</b> in the same preparation, we discovered that twice as many cells in a ganglion oscillated with crawling compared to swimming. Of the cells that oscillated with swimming, a large percentage also oscillated with crawling. We characterized two previously unidentified interneurons, one that has a multifunctional role in both swimming <b>and</b> <b>crawling</b> <b>and</b> one that is dedicated to crawlin...|$|R

500|$|The {{song was}} written at the ocean's point of view, {{detailing}} the human's evolution. According to Jason Killingsworth from Paste magazine, it calls listeners' attention to [...] "Mother Oceania" [...] {{from which the}} singer believes all life emerged, whilst she sings: [...] "You have done well for yourselves / Since you left my wet embrace / <b>And</b> <b>crawled</b> ashore [...] ". The song anchors the midsection of Medúlla, [...] "jubilantly punctuated with bubbling synth and propelled by the rolling, spitfire cadence of Rahzel's beatbox", according to the reviewer. The last line from the song, [...] "Your sweat is salty/ And I am why/ Your sweat is salty/ And I am why", is about how [...] "we were all little jellyfish or whatever before we made it on to land", according to the singer. Elthan Brown from New York magazine considered these lyrics as [...] "frank sensuality". [...] "Oceania" [...] also features The London Choir. Entertainment Weeklys writer Chris Willman commented that [...] "the computer-enhanced choir behind Björk [...] a cosmic harem of pleased dolphins. Here she imagines herself as the sea itself, proud of all the belegged creatures she's spit out onto land over the last hundred million years. It's the nearest evolutionists have come to having their own gospel tune".|$|E
500|$|Lee Ruth Davis, her sister, and two {{brothers}} were {{hidden by the}} Wrights while their father hid in the woods. On the morning of Poly Wilkerson's funeral, the Wrights left the children alone to attend. Davis and her siblings crept {{out of the house}} to hide with relatives in the nearby town of Wylly, but they were turned back for being too dangerous. The children spent the day in the woods but decided to return to the Wrights' house. After spotting men with guns on their way back, they crept back to the Wrights, who were frantic with fear. Davis later described the experience: [...] "I was laying that deep in water, that is where we sat all day long... We got on our bellies <b>and</b> <b>crawled.</b> We tried to keep people from seeing us through the bushes... We were trying to get back to Mr. Wright house. After we got all the way to his house, Mr. and Mrs. Wright were all the way out in the bushes hollering and calling us, and when we answered, they were so glad." [...] Several other white residents of Sumner hid black residents of Rosewood and smuggled them out of town. Gainesville's black community took in many of Rosewood's evacuees, waiting for them at the train station and greeting survivors as they disembarked, covered in sheets. On Sunday, January 7, a mob of 100 to 150 whites returned to burn the remaining dozen or so structures of Rosewood.|$|E
500|$|In January 1942, SS-Untersturmführer Herbert Andorfer was {{appointed}} to replace the inexperienced Enge as commander of the camp. Enge was subsequently made Andorfer's deputy. That month, German military authorities demanded the camp be cleared of Jews {{in order to accommodate}} the growing number of captives taken in battles with the Partisans. By February the camp held about 6,500 inmates, ten percent of whom were Romani. In early March, Andorfer was informed that a gas van had been sent to the camp from Berlin. The Sauer van had been delivered upon the request of the German military administration chief in Serbia, Harald Turner. Stricken with guilt over having to {{play a central role in}} the murder of the Jewish inmates, some of whom he had developed good relations with, Andorfer requested a transfer; this was denied. In order to ensure the quickness and efficiency of the gassings, he made announcements intended to convince the prisoners that they were going to be transferred to another, better-equipped camp. He went so far as to post fictitious camp regulations, and announced that prisoners would be allowed to take their bags with them. Many detainees registered for the supposed transfer, hoping to escape the camp's terrible living conditions. Inmates who had volunteered to leave the previous evening climbed into the van the next day in groups of between 50 and 80. The drivers of the van, SS-Scharführers Meier and Götz, distributed candy to children in order to win their affection. Afterwards, the doors of the van were sealed shut. The van then followed a small car driven by Andorfer and Enge, before crossing the border into German-occupied Serbia. It was here that one of the drivers exited the van <b>and</b> <b>crawled</b> underneath it, diverting its exhaust into the interior of the vehicle and killing the inmates with carbon monoxide gas. The van was then taken to the Avala firing range, where corpses were dumped into mass graves freshly dug by Serbian and Romani prisoners. Such gassings became routine, and the gas van arrived every day except Sunday. Rumours quickly circulated about the gassings, with news reaching German troops stationed in Belgrade and even some Serbians. Consequently, the gas van was nicknamed the [...] "soul killer" [...] (...) by the Serb population exposed to these rumours. It is thought that the gassings took the lives of as many as 8,000 inmates, mostly women and children. The seven Serbian prisoners that had participated in unloading the murdered inmates from the van were shot after the gassings stopped, but the gravedigger, a Serb named Vladimir Milutinović, survived. [...] "Eighty-one or eighty-two trenches were prepared and I helped dig all of them," [...] he recalled. [...] "At least 100 people [...] into each trench These ones were only for those suffocated in the truck. We dug a different set for those who were shot." ...|$|E
