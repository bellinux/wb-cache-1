25|$|The Safavids were {{traditionally}} {{allied with}} the Mughals in India against the Uzbeks, who coveted the province of Khorasan. The Mughal emperor Humayun had given Abbas' grandfather, Shah Tahmasp, the province of Kandahar {{as a reward for}} helping him back to his throne. In 1590, profiting from the confusion in Iran, Humayun's successor Akbar seized Kandahar. Abbas continued to maintain cordial relations with the Mughals, while <b>always</b> <b>asking</b> for the return of Kandahar. Finally, in 1620, a diplomatic incident in which the Iranian ambassador refused to bow {{down in front of the}} Emperor Jahangir led to war. India was embroiled in civil turmoil and Abbas found he only needed a lightning raid to take back the far easternmost town of Kandahar in 1622.|$|E
25|$|Between 1818 and 1827, {{the canal}} {{collected}} tolls of £2,546 per year, and its reserves rose from £8,520 in 1800 to £28,000 in 1829. If the £57,000 of public {{money spent on}} its restoration was ignored, it made a modest profit. William Dawson introduced a private passenger service from Portadown to Newry in 1813, and although he was <b>always</b> <b>asking</b> for the tolls to be reduced, the service continued for many years. Although the Tyrone Navigation had finally opened in 1787, this {{did not result in}} coal traffic using the canal. The importance of Newry as a port declined as Belfast became more prominent, and the ship canal could not cope with the increasing size of ships as sail was replaced by steam. Various engineers were consulted, including John Brownrigg, Sir John Rennie and Alexander Nimmo. All suggested that a larger sea lock was required in deeper water, and that the ship canal needed to be enlarged.|$|E
500|$|However, rumors persisted and it {{was later}} whispered in society that Rasputin had seduced not only the Tsarina but also the four grand duchesses. The gossip was fueled by ardent, yet by all {{accounts}} innocent, letters written to Rasputin by the Tsarina and the four grand duchesses which were released by Rasputin and which circulated throughout society. [...] "My dear, precious, only friend," [...] wrote Anastasia. [...] "How much I should {{like to see you}} again. You appeared to me today in a dream.

[...] Writer Kent Osborne said of Fagerbakke, [...] "He is this big guy, and he plays Patrick so well. He's just this big guy, and he lumbers around." [...] Fagerbakke said, [...] "I'm clumsy.

500|$|Following the show's cancellation, Cuoco {{said that}} she {{preferred}} working sitcoms rather than dramas. She felt the [...] "18-hour days {{where you want to}} kill yourself" [...] did not leave her with enough time to have a life outside of work and the demanding shooting schedule did not allow her enough time to work with Combs, Milano, and McGowan. Cuoco also said she only understood her performance on the show after watching the final cuts of the episodes with the special effects and animations; she explained: [...] "But when you are working, you are waiting and waiting, and then things are invisible, and things are being thrown, and nothing's in your hand, and I'm like so confused and <b>always</b> <b>asking</b> everyone, 'What's happening?'". She also voiced her contempt for the outfits given to her for the character's magical transformations. She said she cried when she first saw her superhero costume for the season eight episode [...] "Battle of the Hexes", which originally included a cape. A writer from WE tv listed Billie's superhero look as one of the show's [...] "sexiest and most bizarre outfits". Cuoco {{said that she}} also disliked the black vinyl outfit and wig that she wore during her first two episodes.|$|E
500|$|... "Desperately Xeeking Xena" [...] {{was written}} by staff writer Long. At the {{beginning}} of the segment, Milhouse is seen wearing a plastic smock with a picture of Radioactive Man on it. The scene was based on an experience in Long's childhood; [...] "I asked my mom for a Batman costume. And I got a smock that had Batman on it and said 'Batman'. It was very dispiriting" [...] he said in the episode's DVD commentary. [...] "Stretch Dude & Clobber Girl"'s theme song {{was written by}} Long and composed by Alf Clausen. During the sequence, Stretch Dude and Clobber Girl are seen assaulting Saddam Hussein, the fifth President of Iraq and being thanked for their help by President Bill Clinton afterwards. According to Long, the writing staff had a [...] "passionate" [...] discussion about whether the duo would be attacking Hussein or Iranian religious leader and politician Ruhollah Khomeini during the sequence. Scully quipped that Hussein was chosen because [...] "he was <b>always</b> <b>asking</b> to be on the show." [...] The segment features New Zealand actress Lucy Lawless as herself. According to Long, Lawless was very happy with the segment's script. She was especially fond of the speech she gives to The Collector, in which she mentions that she was very tall as an adolescent. Lawless was directed by Scully, who commented that she was [...] "terrific". In an interview with the Hungarian online newspaper Origo, Lawless said that her part in the episode was the best experience she had guest-starring for a show. [...] "It was really funny when the Comic Book Guy kidnapped me", she said.|$|E

2500|$|Butler was {{scheduled}} to have made his directorial debut in January 1979 with Adrift & Beyond, but it never came to fruition. Butler turned down Coppola's offer to direct the photography for Apocalypse Now (1979). Butler has worked in films during the 2000s, such as Frailty (2002) and Funny Money (2006). Bill Paxton, {{the director of the}} former film, said, [...] "I was excited when Bill Butler who was the cinematographer on such classic films as Jaws and The Conversation came aboard as my director of photography for Frailty. And I really picked his brain, <b>always</b> <b>asking</b> 'how did you do this shot?' and 'how did you figure that out?'" [...] Bill Butler recounts his initial conversations with Paxton about the script: [...] "I liked the direction he wanted to take, and he inspired me to share his vision. It was a great collaboration." ...|$|E

In 1999, TEWS [...] was expanded overseas to adults at the Zermatt Creativity and Leadership Symposium held in Switzerland.|$|E
2500|$|Debussy's {{great service}} to music was to reawaken among all musicians an {{awareness}} of harmony and its possibilities. In that, {{he was just as}} important as Beethoven, who revealed to us the possibilities of progressive form, or as Bach, who showed us the transcendent significance of counterpoint. Now, what I am <b>always</b> <b>asking</b> myself is this: is it possible to make a synthesis of these three great masters, a living synthesis that will be valid for our time? [...] Debussy's influence is present in the Fourteen Bagatelles (1908). These made Ferruccio Busoni exclaim 'At last something truly new!' [...] Until 1911, Bartók composed widely differing works which ranged from adherence to romantic-style, to folk song arrangements and to his modernist opera Bluebeard's Castle. The negative reception of his work led him to focus on folk music research after 1911 and abandon composition with the exception of folk music arrangements ( [...] ; [...] ).|$|E

2500|$|Chakraverti {{was born}} on 3 November 1950, to diplomat Debabrata Chakraverti, and Roma Sen, a {{descendant}} of the royals. Chakraverti {{spent much of her}} early life in Montreal, Canada, where her father was stationed. He was a representative from India to the Council of ICAO. An only child, she shared her father's passion for reading and devoured books on Indian mysticism and traditions partly because people at Montreal were <b>always</b> <b>asking</b> questions about India. In 1965, while on vacation in the Laurentian mountains, Chakraverti was invited to an all woman's party by one of her mother's friends, Carlotta. There, she was introduced to the Society for the Study of Ancient Cultures and Civilizations, founded [...] by Carlotta. The group studied ancient texts, long-forgotten customs and the mystical way of life. Chakraverti was selected to join the group, through a process of initiation, and enrolled for a course with them. For the next five years, she stayed in a chalet on the mountains and studied ancient cultures and their long-forgotten rituals with eleven other women, with Carlotta as their teacher. Alcohol, close friendship or anything that distracted them from the prescribed hours of study, solitude and meditation, were taboo. Practical training in witchcraft was the only way; it included learning varied techniques of self-development and understanding the significance of ancient chants, movements, symbols, gestures, invoking energy from the elements, and training {{in the use of the}} apparatus integral to the craft. Chakraverti later commented, [...] "It started as an academic curiosity. [...] Wicca includes both scientific facts and old lore. We studied Carl Jung and Friedrich Nietzsche because Wicca means studying various layers of the human mind." [...] In 1972, near the completion of their course, Chakraverti, along with two other women were asked to choose between Way of Tao, Wicca and Kabbalah as their practiced craft; Chakraverti chose Wicca. She later commented that ancient goddesses like Isis, Artemis, Hecate, Kali and Freya, played an important role in deciding her future in Wicca.|$|E
