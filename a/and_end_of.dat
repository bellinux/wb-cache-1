5|$|Genelia D'Souza {{was chosen}} to play the female lead Hasini, reprising her role from the {{original}} film. Prakash Raj, who also acted in the original film, {{was chosen to}} reprise {{his role as the}} protagonist's father and Geetha was signed to play the character's mother. Former cricketer Sadagoppan Ramesh made his acting debut in this film, playing Santosh's elder brother. Raja felt he facially resembled Ravi. Sayaji Shinde was signed to play Hasini's father. Kirat Bhattal was selected to play Santosh's fiancée. Actors Kausalya, Santhanam, Premgi Amaren, Srinath and Sathyan, were also added to the cast.

5|$|Items {{from the}} TV series such as multi-perspective screens (as {{shown on the}} box cover) were popular for {{illustrating}} multiple viewpoints of an objective. The use of episode start and end graphics to mark the start <b>and</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> missions was also liked. The script was generally described as being a redeeming feature of the game, although fans of the series may find that the viewpoints, motives and reasoning of the villains isn't covered well. Cutscenes were singled out for particular praise by IGN, highlighting good use of camera angles and tight focus. Voice acting was generally popular, although some lines suffered from poor direction or emphasis. In contrast, device and ambiance sounds were well received with gunfire getting a particular mention.|$|E
5|$|Like the series, {{the game}} takes place over 24 hours {{and has the}} same start and end clocks for each hour, marking the start <b>and</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> {{each part of the}} game. The hours are broken down into 58 {{separate}} missions, of which there are three broad types, each described in further detail below. Some missions are objective based, while others have a time-restricted element. Each mission is graded out of 100 points, based on the quality of performance, number of objectives completed, shooting accuracy and so on. A grade of 90 points or higher rewards the player by unlocking some form of bonus feature, including three movies (interviews with cast about the game, TV promos), 98 images (wallpaper-like images of main characters) and 23 characters (3D models that the player can view).|$|E
5|$|Riders were {{required}} to sign in at checkpoints during each stage to minimize the opportunities for cheating; they were also photographed at the beginning <b>and</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> each stage, and the images compared by the judges.

5|$|Sound {{technicians}} {{spent the}} early part of the year trying to find the right sounds. Some, such as animal sounds like those of tigers and walruses, were bought. Human voices were also used. Fran Walsh contributed to the Nazgûl scream and David Farmer the Warg howls. Other sounds were unexpected: the fell beast's screech is taken from that of a donkey, and the mûmakils bellow comes from the beginning <b>and</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a lion's roar. In addition, ADR was used for most of the dialogue.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch stage show {{featured}} DeLange and Waylon using a specially-designed microphone {{stand to}} allow them to face each other, both playing guitars, while a bassist, a drummer and a cellist performed in the background. Low lighting was used throughout the performance, with large swooping camera shots at the beginning <b>and</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the song implemented along with several close-ups {{during the rest of the}} performance. On the floor of the stage LED screens simulated road markings, while further screens on the background showed a rainy forest scene, transforming into a dry forest scene towards the end of the song's performance.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{moved to}} a small island in the Bahamas called White Cay for the {{beginning}} <b>and</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Isla Cruces battle, before production took a break until August, where in Los Angeles the interiors of the Flying Dutchman were shot. On September 18, 2005, the crew moved to Grand Bahama Island to shoot ship exteriors, including the working Black Pearl and Flying Dutchman. Filming there was a tumultuous period, starting {{with the fact that}} the tank had not actually been finished. The hurricane season caused many pauses in shooting, and Hurricane Wilma damaged many of the accessways and pumps, though no one was hurt nor were any of the ships destroyed. Filming completed on September 10, 2005.|$|E

5|$|The {{filaments}} {{are preserved}} with {{a gap between}} the bones, which several authors have noted corresponds closely to the expected amount of skin and muscle tissue that would have been present in life. The feathers are closest to the bone on the skull <b>and</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the tail, where little to no muscle was present, and the gap increases over the back vertebrae, where more musculature would be expected, indicating that the filaments were external to the skin and do not correspond with subcutaneous structures.|$|E
5|$|The {{sculpture}} {{has been}} used as a backdrop in commercial films, notably in the 2006 Hollywood film The Break-Up, which had to reshoot several scenes because the sculpture was under cover for the initial filming. It is also prominently featured in the ending scene of Source Code. Director Duncan Jones felt the structure was a metaphor for the movie's subject matter and aimed for it to be shown at the beginning <b>and</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the movie. The sculpture served as an aesthetic and symbolic setting for the 2012 film The Vow when the lead characters share a kiss under it.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{returned}} to Germany in early 1941 for a refit and {{was transferred to}} Norway in June 1941 {{as part of the}} preparations for Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Richard Beitzen spent some time {{at the beginning of the}} campaign conducting anti-shipping patrols in Soviet waters, but these were generally fruitless. She escorted a number of German convoys in the Arctic later in the year. The ship escorted several German heavy cruisers at the beginning <b>and</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> their anti-shipping raids in 1942. She participated in the Battle of the Barents Sea when Convoy JW 51B was attacked on 31 December 1942 near the North Cape, Norway.|$|E
