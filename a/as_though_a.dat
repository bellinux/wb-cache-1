5|$|On October 8, 2012, Pixar {{revealed}} a fully functional website for Monsters University, complete {{with information about}} admissions, academic and campus life, and a campus store to purchase MU apparel. On April 1, 2013, the website was styled to appear <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>a</b> rival college, Fear Tech, had hacked and vandalized it. The first television commercial for the film was aired during the 2013 Rose Bowl Game, parodying advertisements for participating schools that are shown during college football telecasts. From June 27 until July 11, 2013, Disney's online game Club Penguin hosted a Monsters University Takeover event to promote the film. Players could dress up as their favorite monsters and {{take part in the}} Scare Games.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} assumed to have been lost for many years until a paper copy was {{identified}} in 1968 in the Library of Congress Paper Print archive by Michael Pointer, a historian of Sherlock Holmes films. Because motion pictures were not covered by copyright laws until 1912, paper prints were submitted by studios wishing to register their works. These were made using light-sensitive paper of the same width and length as the film itself, and developed <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>a</b> still photograph. Both the Edison Company and the Biograph Company submitted entire motion pictures as paper prints, {{and it is in}} this form that most of them survive. The film has subsequently been transferred to 16 mm film in the Library of Congress collection.|$|E

25|$|The {{wide range}} of {{possibilities}} (including impossibility) of interpretation of monochrome paintings is arguably why the monochrome is so engaging to so many artists, critics, and writers. Although the monochrome has never become dominant and few artists have committed themselves exclusively to it, it has never gone away. It reappears <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>a</b> spectre haunting high modernism, or {{as a symbol of}} it, appearing during times of aesthetic and sociopolitical upheavals.|$|E

500|$|Cú Chulainn's {{appearance}} is occasionally remarked {{on in the}} texts. He is usually described as small, youthful and beardless. He {{is often described as}} dark: in The Wooing of Emer and Bricriu's Feast he is [...] "a dark, sad man, comeliest of the men of Erin", in The Intoxication of the Ulstermen he is a [...] "little, black-browed man", and in The Phantom Chariot of Cú Chulainn [...] "is hair was thick and black, and smooth <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>a</b> cow had licked it... in his head his eyes gleamed swift and grey"; yet the prophetess Fedelm in the Táin Bó Cúailnge describes him as blond.

500|$|In 1849, Tubman {{became ill}} again, which diminished her {{value as a}} slave. Edward Brodess tried to sell her, but {{could not find a}} buyer. Angry at him for trying to sell her and for {{continuing}} to enslave her relatives, Tubman began to pray for her owner, asking God to make him change his ways. She said later: [...] "I prayed all night long for my master till the first of March; and all the time he was bringing people to look at me, and trying to sell me." [...] When it appeared <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>a</b> sale was being concluded, [...] "I changed my prayer," [...] she said. [...] "First of March I began to pray, 'Oh Lord, if you ain't never going to change that man's heart, kill him, Lord, and take him out of the way.'" [...] A week later, Brodess died, and Tubman expressed regret for her earlier sentiments.|$|E
500|$|Adam Noah Levine {{was born}} in Los Angeles on March 18, 1979 to Fred Levine, the founder of retail chain M. Fredric, and Patsy (née Noah) Levine, an admissions counselor. He has a brother Michael, two half-siblings Sam and Liza Levine and step-sister Julia Bartolf Milne. Levine's father and {{maternal}} grandfather are both Jewish, while his maternal grandmother was a Protestant. Levine considers himself Jewish, though according to an interview with The Jewish Chronicle, he [...] "has rejected formal religious practice for a more generalized, spiritual way of life." [...] He chose {{not to have a}} Bar Mitzvah as a child, explaining: [...] "I felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>a</b> lot of kids were trying to cash in ... I just don't think it's the most respectful way to deal with God and beliefs and {{years and years and years}} of cultural heritage." [...] Levine is a nephew of journalist and author Timothy Noah, television producer and writer Peter Noah, and economist Jordan Levine.|$|E
500|$|In a February 2009 {{interview}} with Jalylah Burrell of Vibe magazine, Gil Scott-Heron discussed the album's concept and title, {{as well as}} the social and political atmosphere at the time of Winter in Americas recording. In retrospect, he stated [...] "We felt as though we had come across something that people did not understand or did not recognize but that's the season that we were going into, not for three months but {{for an extended period of}} time. A lot of the folks who represented summer and spring and fall had been killed and assassinated. The only season left is winter. ...Bobby Kennedy and Dr. King and John Kennedy, those were folks who represented spring and summer, and they killed them. So we wanted to do an album about where we were. And we weren't trying to depress people, hell, they were living it, they already knew but we were trying to describe it and were certainly not alone... we felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>a</b> part of it was the folks in charge of the political structure. They were snowmen..." ...|$|E

500|$|Other reviewers {{have criticized}} the {{character}} development. Shane Bettenhausen of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine found the game's cast [...] "a tad mundane" [...] compared to characters from previous installments. Moreover, they found both Vaan and Ashe uninteresting, making the story lack [...] "the emotional punch". They also criticized the voice acting as uneven and rife with mispronunciations. GameTrailers also criticized the characters, saying {{that many of the}} game's [...] "other characters" [...] are [...] "more interesting than the ones you’ll actually control", and that the [...] "characters’ motivations are thin to non-existent". RPGFan editor Stephen Harris, while praising the quality of most of the voice acting and especially Balthier's, criticized Fran's as [...] "monotone and subdued" [...] with an [...] "indecipherable accent". Cortney Stone of RPGamer found fault with the voice acting recording, describing it as [...] "substandard" [...] and said that [...] "it sounds <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>a</b> few of the actors were too close to the microphones or the equipment was faulty", though she called [...] "the voice acting itself quite good, with characters of different nations having distinctive accents." ...|$|E
500|$|Cooper's {{ability to}} project his {{personality}} onto his characters {{played an important}} part in his appearing natural and authentic on screen. Actor John Barrymore said of Cooper, [...] "This fellow is the world's greatest actor. He does without effort what the rest of us spend our lives trying to learn—namely, to be natural." [...] Charles Laughton, who played opposite Cooper in Devil and the Deep agreed, [...] "In truth, that boy hasn't the least idea how well he acts ... He gets at it from the inside, from his own clear way of looking at life." [...] William Wyler, who directed Cooper in two films, called him a [...] "superb actor, a master of movie acting". In his review of Cooper's performance in The Real Glory, Graham Greene wrote, [...] "Sometimes his lean photogenic face seems to leave everything to the lens, but there is no question here of his not acting. Watch him inoculate the girl against cholera—the casual jab of the needle, and the dressing slapped on while he talks, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>a</b> thousand arms had taught him where to stab and he doesn't have to think anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|Brad O'Mancey from Popjustice {{believed}} that the song failed as an [...] "album opener", but sounds [...] "slightly better" [...] after one finished the whole record. Chicago Tribune journalist Greg Kot {{believed that}} unlike Madonna's 80s Catholic imagery, [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] does not venture into new territory with its sound. Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald found the song [...] "laughable", calling it a [...] "yawning Catholic-girl-in-heat". In another review of the album for BBC News, Levine called it [...] "charmless genero-banger". Alex Macpherson from Fact panned the track, saying that the [...] "rote, lifeless singing on [...] sounds <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>a</b> guide track was mistakenly kept on the finished song, and arguably marks the worst vocal performance Madonna has ever committed to record." [...] Robert Leedham from Drowned in Sound website felt that the song did not represent the album's sound, hence failed as a single to promote it. Jon Pareles from The New York Times called it [...] "shallow, effective club fodder", describing it as containing [...] "blippy stereo-hopping synthesizers and generic title". This view was shared by Emily Mackay of The Quietus, who felt that the song {{would have been better}} for another artist and was below Madonna's level.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the growing}} tension, Haynes {{remained}} a member and Betts returned. Their third post-reunion record, Where It All Begins (1994), was recorded entirely live. [...] "The Allman Brothers was a year-by-year thing. There {{was no indication}} that it was capable of staying together for years to come. We all looked at it as each tour could be the last one, {{and there was no}} reason to think otherwise," [...] said Haynes. The band continued to tour with greater frequency, attracting younger generations with their headlining of the H.O.R.D.E. Festival. The group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1995; Allman was severely inebriated and could not make it through his acceptance speech. Seeing the ceremony broadcast on television later, Allman was mortified, providing a catalyst for his final, successful attempt to quit alcohol and substance abuse. During the 1996 run at the Beacon, turmoil came to a breaking point between Allman and Betts, nearly causing a cancellation of a show and causing another band breakup. [...] "We were upstairs in our dressing rooms [...] I’m sitting there thinking, 'This is it. This is how it finally ends,'" [...] said Trucks. Haynes and Woody left to focus on Gov't Mule, feeling <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>a</b> break was imminent with the Allman Brothers Band.|$|E
500|$|Susie's ballads occupy roughly {{one-third of}} the film, {{performing}} {{a combination of both}} contemporary and classic standards. Rosenberg compared the character to actress Marilyn Monroe's character Sugar Kane Kowalczyk in the film Some Like it Hot (1959). Susie's lack of singing experience is balanced by an [...] "ineffable vocal quality that causes people to listen, because they might be missing something." [...] Steve Vineberg, writing in the journal Film Quarterly, agreed that, despite her unimpressive voice, Susie [...] "wears a lyric tight to her skin, liked a zipped-up sleeping bag." [...] According to Télérama's Guillemette Odicino, the character has been [...] "endowed with a voice and a charm to take the breath." [...] Susie remains a heavily guarded individual until she performs [...] "Makin' Whoopee", which finally allows her to lower her defenses. When Susie performs the song, she is – for the first time – not singing to the audience, but to her sole accompanist Jack instead. According to Slant film critic Chuck Bowen, [...] "When Susie sings 'Makin' Whoopee' in a traffic-stopping red dress, mounting Jack's piano as if it's an extension of his very essence... all bets of detached, business-collaborative stability between the two are understood to be off." [...] Bowen also compared the character's performance to actress Rita Hayworth's in the film Gilda (1946). Prior to this moment, it almost appears <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>a</b> romantic relationship might never actually develop between the two characters. Observing that the character's tough attitude matches the difficult life she has been through, Janet Maslin of The New York Times believes that Susie must be [...] "singing from experience" [...] when she performs the song [...] "Ten Cents a Dance". Go Slow: The Life of Julie London author Michael Owen considers both Pfeiffer's performance and Susie herself to be a tribute to actress and singer Julie London, citing similarities such as asking her accompanist to perform [...] "More Than You Know" [...] in a slow tempo, swearing into a live microphone and delivering a [...] "sexy rendition" [...] of [...] "Makin' Whoopee", capturing [...] "some of the essence of Julie's style." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ballon (...) is the {{appearance}} of being lightweight and light-footed while jumping. It is a desirable aesthetic in ballet and other dance genres, making it seem <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>a</b> dancer effortlessly becomes airborne, floats in the air, and lands softly.
