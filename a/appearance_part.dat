This addition to the character's skill set made him the second major hacker in the DC Universe, being preceded by Barbara Gordon's debut as Oracle, and was quickly adapted by 1992 to allow the character to gain information on other heroes and villains from police computer networks.|$|E

50|$|The {{old town}} {{has been well}} restored. It is a genuine walled {{community}} jutting out into the sea. Many of the houses have been re-built and painted {{in a range of}} pastel colours. In a central square there is the cathedral (12th-13th century), dedicated to St. Mary of the Purification: it is a noteworthy example of Apulian Romanesque architecture which houses the relics of the two city's patron saints, Bassus of Lucera (San Basso) and Timothy. The upper part of the façade was destroyed by an earthquake in 1456, and also suffered from the Turkish sack of the city in 1566. The Baroque additions were eliminated in the restoration of 1930 - 69, returning the edifice to its original <b>appearance.</b> <b>Part</b> of a pre-existing basilica, built in the 11th century (over the original, smaller cathedral called Ecclesia Sanctae Mater) but soon destroyed, has been found under the edifice.|$|E
5000|$|In 2003, {{producer}} Louise Berridge negotiated for Leslie Grantham to reprise {{the role}} of Sharons father Den, 14 years after his last <b>appearance.</b> <b>Part</b> of her motive for doing so was to bring Sharon, whom she described {{as one of her}} favourite characters, [...] "right back where she belonged, {{at the very heart of}} the show." [...] The character Den had supposedly been killed in 1989 and a body found the following year had been identified as his, so the programme makers needed to make certain that his return could be plausibly explained. A research team was employed to scour over past episodes of EastEnders to make certain that his return storyline would not have been going against anything that had been shown prior, or that could not have been [...] "faked". In an interview with Walford Web, Berridge discussed how her researchers discovered that there were inconsistencies in the episodes that aired during 1989 and 1990, that could account for Dens death being staged. She commented, [...] "A great deal was made in the show of Dens signet ring turning up proof that he died—but if you watch the episode of the shooting youll see he isnt even wearing it at the time of his supposed death. So how did it get in the canal?". Berridges writers concocted a story whereby the body that was recovered in 1990 was misidentified as Dens; Den fled to Spain to escape the mobsters and allowed his family to believe he was dead until he was traced in 2003.|$|E

5000|$|Papyri of the Roman period are {{far more}} {{numerous}} and show greater variety. The cursive of the 1st century has a rather broken <b>appearance,</b> <b>part</b> of one character being often made separately from the rest and linked to the next letter. A form characteristic of the 1st and 2nd century and surviving after that only as a fraction sign (=⅛) is η in the shape [...] By {{the end of the}} 1st century, there had been developed several excellent types of cursive, which, though differing considerably both in the forms of individual letters and in general appearance, bear a family likeness to one another. Qualities which are specially noticeable are roundness in the shape of letters, continuity of formation, the pen being carried on from character to character, and regularity, the letters not differing strikingly in size and projecting strokes above or below the line being avoided. Sometimes, especially in tax-receipts and in stereotyped formulae, cursiveness is carried to an extreme. In a letter of the prefect, dated in 209, we have a fine example of the Chancery hand, with tall and laterally compressed letters, ο very narrow and α and ω often written high in the line. This style, from at least {{the latter part of the}} 2nd century, exercised considerable influence on the local hands, many of which show the same characteristics less pronounced; and its effects may be traced into the early part of the 4th century. Hands of the 3rd century uninfluenced by it show a falling off from the perfection of the 2nd century; stylistic uncertainty and a growing coarseness of execution mark a period of decline and transition.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{levels of}} appearance-related concern in a normative population of adolescents. Design: Action research methodology {{was used to}} help adolescents develop a questionnaire that elicited peer views on <b>appearance</b> (<b>Part</b> 1) and to further develop the Changing Faces psychosocial strategies for dealing with appearance-related bullying (Part 2). Participants: Adolescents aged 11 – 19. 5 years {{were involved in the}} development of a questionnaire on the extent and nature of appearance-related concerns: 36 in development of antibullying strategies and 210 in an intervention. Intervention: Part 3 of the project was an intervention that included information on the importance of appearance in human interactions as well as learning and practicing eight nonconfrontational coping strategies. Main Outcome Measures: The questionnaires developed by the adolescents, in addition to Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Questionnaire for Adolescents, were used preintervention, postintervention, and at 6 months postintervention. Results: Of 11 – 13 year olds questioned, 75...|$|E
40|$|Using newly {{collected}} and existing data and modern econometric approaches, this book analyses the gender wage gap {{as well as}} less explored dimensions of discrimination such as religion, sexual orientation, and physical <b>appearance.</b> <b>Part</b> One focuses on gender. Using a newly collected database for Italy, it analyses the relevance of transition from school to work, {{and in particular the}} choice of college major, in determining the gender earning gap. It also analyses the role of family and of discrimination on the job as a potential source of this gap, using additional data from Spain and the US. Part Two analyses different forms of discrimination towards individuals in the labor market. In particular, it examines the potential for discrimination of sexual orientation, religion, and physical appearance and weight. The analysis is conducted by means of a survey of the existing literature and by an empirical analysis, using European data as well as Italian data collected through an experimental design...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} part-based {{approach}} {{to the problem of}} hu-man attribute recognition from a single image of a human body. To recognize the attributes of human from the body parts, it is important to reliably detect the parts. This is a challenging task due to the geometric variation such as articulation and view-point changes as well as the appear-ance variation of the parts arisen from versatile clothing types. The prior works have primarily focused on handling geometric variation by relying on pre-trained part detectors or pose estimators, which require manual part annotation, but the appearance variation has been relatively neglected in these works. This paper explores the importance of the appearance variation, which {{is directly related to the}} main task, attribute recognition. To this end, we propose to learn a rich <b>appearance</b> <b>part</b> dictionary of human with signifi-cantly less supervision by decomposing image lattice into overlapping windows at multiscale and iteratively refining local appearance templates. We also present quantitative results in which our proposed method outperforms the ex-isting approaches. 1...|$|E
