5|$|Agent Doggett {{returns home}} after work and finds Absalom {{waiting for him}} with a gun. Absalom demands Doggett show {{the back of his}} neck to confirm that Doggett is still himself. He tells Doggett that the man killed at the White House, Howard Salt, died for what he knew about an alien invasion. Absalom duct tapes his gun to Doggett's back in a plan to get Salt's {{information}} with Doggett used as a hostage. The two attempt to sneak into the census bureau's database; Absalom claims that the census bureau had data which showed the aliens were <b>already</b> <b>here.</b> Unfortunately, the plan fails because of an X-ray scanner detecting the gun. Security shoots Absalom through the head despite his use of Doggett as a body shield.|$|E

25|$|Miller stated at a {{town hall}} meeting that he {{believed}} East Germany was an example of a nation taking effective measures to control the flow of people across a border. Miller believes illegal immigration is a “critically important” issue to deal with because of its economic effects on health care, education and employment. Miller wants to secure the border to stop more immigrants from entering America illegally and protect the country from possible terrorist threats. Miller does not believe the millions of immigrants <b>already</b> <b>here</b> illegally should be granted amnesty. Miller supports efforts by states such as Arizona to enforce immigration laws when the federal government will not, and he believes illegal immigrants should be deported when they come into contact with law enforcement officials.|$|E

2500|$|The Gnostic {{movements}} {{may contain}} {{information about the}} historical Jesus, since some texts preserve sayings which show similarities with canonical sayings. Especially the Gospel of Thomas has {{a significant amount of}} parallel sayings. Yet, a striking difference is that the canonical sayings center on the coming endtime, while the Thomas-sayings center on a kingdom of heaven that is <b>already</b> <b>here,</b> and not a future event. According to Koester, this is because the Thomas-sayings are older, implying that in the earliest forms of Christianity Jesus was regarded as a wisdom-teacher. An alternative hypothesis states that the Thomas authors wrote in the Second Century CE, changing existing sayings and eliminating the apocalyptic concerns. According to April DeConinck, such a change occurred when the endtime did not come, and the Thomasine tradition turned toward a [...] "new theology of mysticism" [...] and a [...] "theological commitment to a fully-present kingdom of heaven here and now, where their church had attained Adam and Eve's divine status before the Fall." ...|$|E
