40|$|Standard TCP misinterpret {{mobility}} loss in Ad hoc network as congestion loss, thus, it {{reduce the}} TCP performance by invoking unnecessary congestion control action. In this paper, we propose two approaches, simELFN (<b>an</b> <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> TCP-ELFN) and TCP-FSR (<b>an</b> <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> TCP-F). They can distinguish {{the essence of}} packet loss and avoid multiple consecutive dupACKs. Analyses and simulations show that they can achieve better TCP performance in Ad hoc network.

5|$|Another {{idea that}} McDonnell {{proposed}} was <b>a</b> <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> a carrier-based Phantom, {{with the goal}} of improving catapult performance and lowering approach speeds. The F-4(HL) would have had a longer fuselage and wingspan, with less sweep, stabilators with increased area and air intakes with auxiliary blow-in doors to increase airflow at low speeds. This proposal was not taken forward.|$|E
5|$|Indoor netball is <b>a</b> <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> netball, played {{exclusively}} indoors, {{in which}} the playing court is surrounded on each side and overhead by a net. The net prevents the ball from leaving the court, permitting faster play by reducing playing stoppages.|$|E

The Amber Room was allegedly still in good condition; this was not admitted at the time so the blame could fall upon the Nazis. To preserve this story, access to the ruins of the castle, which was allowed after World War II, was suddenly restricted to all, including historical and archaeological surveys, but the room is said to be in a storehouse near Konigsburg castle.|$|E

Jackson began to land punches to Silva's face, and the latter attempted a Juji-gatame, <b>a</b> <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> an armbar. Silva could not pull off the hold, and Jackson moved into side control shortly after. From here, Jackson threw punches to Silva's head and followed by landing two knees, again to the head (which were legal under Pride rules).|$|E
5|$|An {{interchange}} {{is planned}} between MD 12 and US 113 south of Snow Hill {{in order to}} improve safety and traffic flow as a follow up to widening US 113; however, the project is currently on hold.

The proposed cost needed to build this interchange is $24.2 million, which includes engineering, acquisition of land, and the actual construction.|$|E

5|$|At the {{completion}} of the regular season, the top four teams progressed to the postseason. It was contested over three weeks, following the Page playoff system. Each stage was decided by a best–of–three game series. Unlike regular season games, which made use of <b>a</b> <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> the International Baseball Federation's mercy rule after seveninnings, no such rule was in place for postseason games; all games went the full nineinnings, with the only exception being two games that were tied after nineinnings, therefore requiring extra innings.|$|E
5|$|Boone's adventures, {{real and}} mythical, {{formed the basis}} of the archetypal hero of the American West, popular in 19th-century novels and 20th-century films. The main {{character}} of James Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales, the first of which was published in 1823, bore striking similarities to Boone; even his name, Nathaniel Bumppo, echoed Daniel Boone's name. As mentioned above, The Last of the Mohicans (1826), Cooper's second Leatherstocking novel, featured a fictionalized version of Boone's rescue of his daughter. After Cooper, other writers developed the Western hero, an iconic figure which began as <b>a</b> <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> Daniel Boone.|$|E
5|$|Camp's new {{scrimmage}} rules {{revolutionized the}} game, though not always as intended. Princeton, in particular, used scrimmage play {{to slow the}} game, making incremental progress towards the end zone during each down. Rather than increase scoring, which had been Camp's original intent, the rule was exploited to maintain control of the ball for the entire game, resulting in slow, unexciting contests. At the 1882 rules meeting, Camp proposed that a team be required to advance the ball a minimum of five yards within three downs. These down-and-distance rules, combined {{with the establishment of}} the line of scrimmage, transformed the game from <b>a</b> <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> rugby football into the distinct sport of American football.|$|E

The Gaza cuisine is <b>a</b> <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> the Levant cuisine, but is more diverse in seafood and spices. Gaza's inhabitants heavily consume chili peppers too.
