5|$|A typical P. exclamans worker {{will live}} somewhere between 14–16 days. The oldest wasp to be {{observed}} in a natural colony was 102 days old. Queens typically live 6 times longer than the workers. There has been some variation observed with the life expectancy of P. exclamans. This has typically been attributed to the colony of origin. It <b>also</b> <b>must</b> be noted that while there is variation between colonies, there typically is less variation between the original nest and the satellite nest. Variation inside a single colony may also occur {{because of the presence}} of different castes. Foragers, those who frequently travel outside the nest, lead a riskier life and tend to have lower life expectancy than those who stay in the nest. Though, it was observed that colonies with high foraging rates also had higher reproductive rates to compensate for the lower life expectancy. Another interesting aspect that was observed in one nest was that an increase in female population led to lower longevity. This was because the females were more focused on competing to become the next queen than foraging and fulfilling their roles.|$|E
5|$|Chicago entered week sixteen with {{a chance}} to clinch the NFC North in the event that the Packers and Lions lost. The Packers and Lions {{eventually}} lost to the Steelers and Giants, respectively, putting the Bears in position to win the division by defeating the Eagles. The last game between the Bears and Eagles was in 2011, when the Bears won 30–24; the Bears also lead the all-time series 30–12–1, though the Eagles had won six of the last ten meetings. However, the Bears had won four of five meetings between the two teams in the last six years, but all by less than six points. One of the Bears' keys to victory is to prevent LeSean McCoy from dominating; the Bears had the worst run defense in the league, while McCoy leads the league in rushing. Chicago's defense <b>also</b> <b>must</b> contain the Eagles' fast-scoring offense: the Eagles had the lowest average time of possession per drive at 2:24, while the league average is 3:27. Philadelphia also is the only team in the league to score in fewer than seven plays per drive. In the passing game, Chicago had the fourth-best passing offense, while the Eagles were 26th in pass defense. However, the Eagles are ranked sixth in rushing defense.|$|E
5|$|The accompaniment for a Peking opera {{performance}} usually {{consists of}} a small ensemble of traditional melodic and percussion instruments. The lead melodic instrument is the jinghu, a small, high-pitched, two-string spike fiddle. The jinghu is the primary accompaniment for performers during songs. Accompaniment is heterophonic – the jinghu player follows the basic contours of the song's melody, but diverges in pitch and other elements. The jinghu often plays more notes per measure than the performer sings, and does so an octave lower. During rehearsal, the jinghu player adopts {{his or her own}} signature version of the song's melody, but <b>also</b> <b>must</b> adapt to spontaneous improvisations {{on the part of the}} performer due to changed performance conditions. Thus, the jinghu player must have an instinctive ability to change his or her performance without warning to properly accompany the performer.|$|E

He joins Aradhana's father in a protest for freedom from the British, but when officers begin to physically abuse the protestors, Javed hides while Aradhana's father is beaten. Aradhana is disgusted with him. To appease her, Javed allows himself to be beaten and arrested in front of her. She visits him in jail and tells him their love cannot happen, but he asks her to wait. Three months later, Javed is freed, but he learns that Aradhana was married a month before. Aradhana tells Javed in tears that she only got married to make her father happy. Soon after, Javed <b>also</b> <b>must</b> marry for his father's happiness. Aradhana comes to the wedding to see him one last time. During the vows, Javed realises Aradhana is wearing a widow's clothes and stops the wedding, insisting on marrying Aradhana.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{in about}} 1950, with the {{publication}} of Psychology of Colonization by Octave Mannoni, The Tempest was viewed more and more through the lens of postcolonial theory. This new {{way of looking at the}} text explored the effect of the coloniser (Prospero) on the colonised (Ariel and Caliban). Though Ariel is often overlooked in these debates in favour of the more intriguing Caliban, he is nonetheless an essential component of them. The French writer Aimé Césaire, in his play Une Tempête sets The Tempest in Haiti, portraying Ariel as a mulatto who, unlike the more rebellious Caliban, feels that negotiation and partnership is the way to freedom from the colonisers. Fernandez Retamar sets his version of the play in Cuba, and portrays Ariel as a wealthy Cuban (in comparison to the lower-class Caliban) who <b>also</b> <b>must</b> choose between rebellion or negotiation. Although scholars have suggested that his dialogue with Caliban in Act two, Scene one, contains hints of a future alliance between the two when Prospero leaves, Ariel is generally viewed by scholars as the good servant, in comparison with the conniving Caliban—a view which Shakespeare's audience may well have shared. Ariel is used by some postcolonial writers as a symbol of their efforts to overcome the effects of colonisation on their culture. For example, Michelle Cliff, a Jamaican author, has said that she tries to combine Caliban and Ariel within herself to create a way of writing that represents her culture better. Such use of Ariel in postcolonial thought is far from uncommon; the spirit is even the namesake of a scholarly journal covering post-colonial criticism.|$|E
