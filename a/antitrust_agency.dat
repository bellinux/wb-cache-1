40|$|Most {{debates over}} the {{structure}} of merger review in the telecommunications industry focus on the criticism {{that the role of}} the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is entirely redundant in light of the review conducted by the <b>antitrust</b> <b>agencies.</b> The FCC 2 ̆ 7 s lack of a consistently applied standard only reinforces such criticisms. There are, however, cases where the FCC 2 ̆ 7 s review of a merger - and imposition of conditions that complement the existing regulatory regime - enable the <b>antitrust</b> <b>agencies</b> to clear mergers that would otherwise pose potential objections. The central challenge for competition policy merger review is to structure the analysis of merger remedies so that the <b>antitrust</b> <b>agencies</b> play an effective and central role, with regulatory agencies complementing - as opposed to overlapping or contradicting - their judgments. At present, the U. S. system sometimes veers towards a worst case scenario where federal antitrust authorities - the FTC and DOJ - impose regulatory remedies that overlap with regulatory policy and regulatory agencies perform duplicative merger reviews and impose remedies unrelated to the mergers themselves. Moreover, antitrust merger remedies themselves are often not developed through a transparent, consistent, or predictable process. In short, there is compelling need for institutional reform of antitrust merger remedies in general and in particular with respect to how the FCC oversees mergers between telecommunications companies. This article proposes a series of reforms to address the fact that the <b>antitrust</b> <b>agencies</b> and the FCC operate {{with a high degree of}} informality, periodic inconsistency, and a questionable allocation of authority between them.

40|$|Analysis of merger {{regulation}} and economical criteria Abstract: The United States of America {{has been the}} cradle of merger regulation. During the last century, the application of rules connected with merger assessment was evolving {{in connection with the}} then-prevalent economic schools (for example the University of Chicago, etc.) and in connection with the amount of regulation of American economy during certain periods. The Courts make decisions whether or not a merger leads or does not to a significant lessening of competition, whereas the petitioners can be persons affected by relevant merger, states or federal <b>antitrust</b> <b>Agencies</b> (FTC or DOJ). The notifications of the merging parties are being filed with the above Federal <b>Antitrust</b> <b>Agencies</b> according to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. There are two possible anticompetitive effects of mergers - unilateral effects and coordinated effects. Both effects complement each other. These effects can be prevented by efficiency gains of the merged entity. The merger assessment in the European Union or the Czech Republic is relatively new in comparison with the US. In contrast to the US, the concentrations in the EU and the Czech Republic are cleared by the <b>Antitrust</b> <b>Agencies</b> (namely the European Commission or Czech Competition Office).

40|$|This paper {{considers}} merger {{control in}} a common agency framework where firms and their competitors can influence the <b>antitrust</b> <b>agency</b> and where transparency - while making lobbying less effective - also implies real resource costs. We examine the performance of two alternative standards that can be assigned to the <b>antitrust</b> <b>agency</b> {{in the presence of}} these regulatory failures. We find that under a welfare standard, lobbying leads to the clearance of relatively inefficient mergers that decrease welfare (i. e. there is a type II error). By contrast, under a consumer surplus standard the agency will ban relatively efficient mergers that would increase welfare (i. e. there is a type I error). Lobbying actually reduces the extent to which this occurs, albeit at a cost in terms of real resources. We also find that a consumer surplus standard is more attractive when mergers are large, when increasing the size of a merger greatly enhances industry profits, when there is little transparency, and when co-ordination costs amongst competitors are low. political economy; merger control; institution design...|$|E

Although this is not the type of full divestiture favored by <b>antitrust</b> <b>agencies,</b> we argue here that a partial divestiture could leave consumers better off after the merger than they were before - under certain conditions.

40|$|This study operationalizes {{the concept}} of hostility {{tradition}} in antitrust as mentioned by Oliver Williamson and Ronald Coase through erroneous law enforcement effects. The <b>antitrust</b> <b>agency</b> may commit type I, not just type II, errors when evaluating an agreement in terms of cartels. Moreover, firms can compete in a standard way, collude or engage in cooperative agreements that improve efficiency. The <b>antitrust</b> <b>agency</b> may misinterpret such cooperative agreements, committing a type I error (over-enforcement). The model set-up is drawn from Motta and Polo (2003) and is extended as described above using the findings of Ghebrihiwet and Motchenkova (2010). Three effects {{play a role in}} this environment. Type I errors may induce firms that would engage in socially efficient cooperation absent errors to opt for collusion (the deserved punishment effect). For other parameter configurations, type I errors may interrupt ongoing cooperation when investigated. In this case, the firms falsely report collusion and apply for leniency, fearing being erroneously fined (the disrupted cooperation effect). Finally, over-enforcement may prevent beneficial cooperation from starting given the threat of being mistakenly fined (the prevented cooperation effect). The results help us understand the negative impact that a hostility tradition in antitrust — which is more likely for inexperienced regimes and regimes with low standards of evidence — and the resulting type I enforcement errors can have on social welfare when applied to the regulation of horizontal agreements. Additional interpretations are discussed in light of leniency programs for corruption and compliance policies for antitrust violations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{challenge}} of effective merger enforcement is tremendous. U. S. <b>antitrust</b> <b>agencies</b> must, by statute, quickly forecast the competitive effects of mergers {{that occur in}} virtually every {{sector of the economy}} to determine if mergers can proceed. Surprisingly, given the complexity of the regulators task, there is remarkably little empirical evidence on the effects of mergers to guide regulators. This paper describes the necessity of retrospective analysis of past mergers in building an empirical basis for antitrust enforcement, and provides guidance on the key measurement issues researchers confront in estimating the price effects of mergers. We also describe how evidence from merger retrospectives can be used to evaluate the economic models used to predict the competitive effects of mergers.

40|$|One of the {{key issues}} in {{international}} antitrust has been how to make antitrust more effective around the world. Most antitrust laws have been adopted or significantly modified since 1990. A number of key jurisdictions are either fairly new to antitrust altogether or to an antitrust regime that effectively employs the latest in economic thinking and the legal tools necessary to promote competition. Jurisdictions that have made antitrust a new and important cornerstone to economic policy include Brazil, Russia, India, and China. Because of the stakes involved {{in the ability of}} antitrust to foster economic development and to prevent misguided antitrust policy from operating as a regulatory tax, it is critical that the future of antitrust focus on improving agency capacity around the world. This Essay focuses on how both external [...] international institutions [...] and internal [...] agency capacity and technical assistance [...] dynamics shape the capacity of younger agencies to undertake antitrust in their jurisdictions. Both approaches {{play an important role in}} improving capacity.

The legislator (''principal'') and the agency share the same objective function with the only exception that the latter must bear information costs. When remedies are not feasible, then the agency's incentive to acquire information is relatively large as a false decision tends to have large adverse effects. When remedies are feasible, the intermediate option does not involve such risks, so that incentives to acquire information decreases. However, our results depend crucially on the institutional environment. In the case of an adversial system, information acquisition incentives are not per se lower if remedies are feasible...|$|E
40|$|Bilateral {{cooperation}} between <b>antitrust</b> <b>agencies,</b> {{in particular the}} European Commission and the US agencies, {{is the focus of}} this new work. It first shows how bilateral cooperation was developed {{as a response to the}} limits of the unilateral and extraterritorial application of national competition laws, and how it has evolved from an instrument initially designed to avoid conflicts into a tool aimed at coordinating joint investigations of international competition cases. It then considers how bilateral cooperation could be used optimally, by analysing two forms of advanced cooperation: the exchange of confidential information, and positive comity, which is the only satisfactory answer competition law can provide to market access cases. It shows that the use of such instruments is limited by significant legal and political obstacles, even in the context of the exemplary EC-US relationship. The book therefore argues that the efficient use of bilateral cooperation will be limited to a small number of well-established competition agencies.
