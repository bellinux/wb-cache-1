500|$|While {{the band}} waited for [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] to be released, they began a {{residency}} at Ciro's Le Disc nightclub on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood. [...] The band's regular appearances at Ciro's during March and April 1965 {{allowed them to}} hone their ensemble playing, perfect their aloof stage persona, and expand their repertoire. [...] In addition, it was during their residency at the nightclub that the band first began to accrue a dedicated following among L.A.'s youth culture and hip Hollywood fraternity, with scenesters like Kim Fowley, Peter Fonda, Jack Nicholson, Arthur Lee, and Sonny & Cher regularly attending the band's performances. [...] On March 26, 1965, <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band's <b>forthcoming</b> debut single, Bob Dylan, made an impromptu visit to the club and joined the Byrds on stage for a rendition of Jimmy Reed's [...] "Baby What You Want Me to Do". [...] The excitement generated by the Byrds at Ciro's quickly made them a must-see fixture on L.A.'s nightclub scene and resulted in hordes <b>of</b> teenagers filling <b>the</b> sidewalks outside the club, desperate to see the band perform. [...] A number of noted music historians and authors, including Richie Unterberger, Ric Menck, and Peter Buckley, have suggested that <b>the</b> crowds <b>of</b> young Bohemians and hipsters that gathered at Ciro's to see the Byrds perform represented <b>the</b> first stirrings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West Coast hippie counterculture.|$|R

5000|$|Grant {{signed on}} 7 February 1885. A month later Badeau added his signature, and {{recorded}} {{the receipt of}} Grant's first payment: [...] "Received of Genl. U. S. Grant $250, my share of $1,000 received by him this day {{on account of his}} book. 3 East 66th St. New York. March 2, 1885." [...] As Grant's Memoirs approached completion, having benefited from Badeau's extensive rewriting and additions to its earlier sections, he became convinced that sales would likely go far higher than the $30,000 envisioned in this agreement. With Grant failing badly, Badeau proposed a new arrangement in April 1885: he would complete the work at the price of $1,000 a month, plus 10% of the profits. Grant thought the offer too generous, and he was additionally annoyed by press leaks that painted Badeau as the true <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forthcoming</b> work. Grant broke off relations with his long-time aide and refused to pay him the $10,000 called for in their agreement. When the sales of the Memoirs skyrocketed past $30,000—they eventually brought $450,000—Badeau sued to get his money. Eventually Mrs. Grant paid him the originally agreed upon $10,000 plus interest of $1,200 (see Brooks D. Simpson article on Badeau in American National Biography). (He subsequently settled with Grant's son Frederick for $10,000, or about $250,000 in 2012 dollars.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The song {{received}} mainly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Jody Rosen from Rolling Stone called the song [...] "a fiercely funky cousin to [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' ." [...] Dan Martin from NME thought {{the song was}} [...] "an absolute revelation, a swirl of psychedelic, orchestra-twinged R&B", and said [...] "Jackson howls a solid-gold melody at his fearsome best, and blippy production and robotic backing vocals dancing behind it." [...] Jason Lipshutz with Gail Mitchell and Gary Graff from Billboard thought the song was [...] "a must-listen songs on Michael", and it [...] "holds {{the highest number of}} Jackson's signature 'hee-hee!' exclaims". Joe Pareles from New York Times said, the song was originally a 1979 hit by Ryuichi Sakamoto’s group Yellow Magic Orchestra with Jackson's lyrics about a coldhearted woman, but the final version which was completed by Mr. McClain was mixed with applause and squeals from concert crowds from Live in Bucharest: The Dangerous Tour DVD. Leah Greenblatt from Entertainment Weekly thought the song seemed [...] "oddly dated by sax flourishes — though perhaps that makes it a good companion to the lilting closer Much Too Soon, an actual relic of the early ’80s". The <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forthcoming</b> book, Man in the Music: The Creative Life and Work of Michael Jackson, Joe Vogel thought John McClain's update to the song was skillful, making it sound brand new and retro at the same time. And he thought the song is [...] "definitely {{one of the highlights of}} the album".|$|E
