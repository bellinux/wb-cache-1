Firstly 9 color features and 8 texture features of disease leaf images are extracted and taken as feature vectors after dimensionality reduction by the K-L transform. Then, for each of apple mosaic virus, apple rust and <b>apple</b> alternaria <b>leaf</b> spot, 40 <b>apple</b> <b>leaf</b> images are selected as the training samples, whose feature vectors are made up of the dictionary of the sparse representation, respectively. Each testing sample is classified into the class with the minimal residual. The identifying results using the proposed method are analyzed and compared with those of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and original sparse representation method. The average classification accuracy rate of the proposed method is 94. 18 %, which confirms its good robustness. In addition, the proposed method not only improves the plant leaf disease classification accuracy but also solves the redundancy problem of the extracted features. </p...|$|R

30|$|A Phoenix tree leaf {{has also}} been studied as an {{adsorbent}} by Han et al. (2007), {{for the removal of}} Methylene blue from aqueous solution. The Phoenix tree leaves contain abundant floristic fiber, protein and some functional groups such as carboxyl, hydroxyl and amidogen, etc., which make biosorption process possible. The leaf is a waste product with practically no cost but its adsorption capacity is 80.90, 83.80, 89.70  mg g− 1 at 295, 305 and 323  K, respectively, makes it an adsorbent of a little importance for dye removal from wastewater.

40|$|Gall midges (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) are {{important}} pests of many horticultural crops. They {{are difficult to}} control by conventional means as the larvae develop in galls surrounded by plant tissue. Gravid females need to locate suitable host plant material on which to lay their eggs and there is good evidence that host-produced odour cues are involved. Gall midge pheromones are now available commercially; these attract males to allow monitoring in the field. However there are currently no lures available to attract females. This work aims to develop lures, {{for up to three}} gall midge species, which attract gravid females and can be used to monitor females in the field. Three species of gall midges were investigated: the raspberry cane midge, Resseliella theobaldi (Barnes), the blackcurrant leaf midge, Dasineura tetensi (Rübsaamen), and the <b>apple</b> <b>leaf</b> midge, Dasineura mali (Kiefer). Field studies showed gravid raspberry cane midge females are attracted to split canes for oviposition. Chemicals were identified using solid phase microextraction (SPME) which were present only or in much larger quantities after canes split. A lure based on these chemicals was tested in the field with different trap types but no significant attraction was seen to the lures of either male or female raspberry cane midges. Blackcurrant leaf midge females lay their eggs on blackcurrant shoots. A suite of volatiles was identified using SPME which were produced by blackcurrant shoots. Bioassay work was carried out in a four-way olfactometer and a wind tunnel to assess female attraction to shoot material but no attraction was seen in either experiment. Solutions containing natural volatile extracts were obtained using entrainment onto Porapak resin. The effect of these chemicals on female blackcurrant leaf midge antennae was assessed using electroantennography (EAG) but there were not enough responses to conclude that any compound was EAG-active. <b>Apple</b> <b>leaf</b> midges lay their eggs on <b>apple</b> <b>leaf</b> shoots.

40|$|Of {{the total}} 14 C-leucine {{taken up by}} intact apple (Pyrus malus L., Golden Delicious) leaf discs, 44 to 62 % is {{incorporated}} into protein from June to early October. Of this amount, an average of 35 % is released by mild, room temperature acid hydrolysis. Prior to mid-August when leaf protein begins to decline, 15 to 20 % of the 14 C-leucine incorporated into protein occurs in water-(buffer) soluble protein, of which only 3 % is released by mild acid hydrolysis. After mid-August, 40 % of the label in protein occurs in soluble protein. The specific radio-activity of the soluble protein increases by 4 - to 5 -fold after mid-August, while that of total protein increases by less than 2 -fold. In presenescent leaves (before the decline of protein in August) 20 micrograms per milliliter cycloheximide inhibits the incorporation of 14 C-leucine into protein by 71 %, and 20 micrograms per milliliter chloramphenicol inhibits it by 30 %. In senescing leaves, cycloheximide inhibits 14 C-leucine by 85 % or more, while chloramphenicol inhibits it by less than 15 %. Coincident to the initial decline of leaf protein, chloramphenicol greatly loses its ability to inhibit the incorporation of 14 C-leucine into <b>apple</b> <b>leaf</b> protein. At all leaf ages, chloramphenicol increases the loss of chlorophyll from <b>apple</b> <b>leaf</b> discs.

40|$|Sulphur oxides {{are formed}} during high {{temperature}} combustion processes from the oxidation of sulphur in the air. The principal source of sulphur oxides is sulphur oxide (SO) and sulphur dioxide (SO 2), collectively known as SO x. SO and SO 2 concentrations are therefore {{the highest in}} industrial area. Other important sources are power stations, heating plants, and industrial processes. Long-term exposure to sulphur dioxide may affect lung function, and that exposure to sulphur dioxide enhances the response to allergens in sensitized individuals.
