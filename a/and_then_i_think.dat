6000|$|... "Yes, sir. I {{believe that}} he foresaw some danger, or else {{he would not have}} talked so. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that what he foresaw happened." ...|$|E
60|$|Jerome. It is not evening now. It {{is almost}} morning. You were {{on your knees}} praying for a great many hours, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you fainted.|$|E
6000|$|... "No groom but a bridegroom, Sir, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I'd rather groom a horse than a lady, for I got well bitâ€”if {{you will}} excuse me, Sir." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "If {{someone would}} rather {{sit in the}} {{reserves}} at a big club and drive around in a Ferrari rather than going out on-loan <b>and</b> playing, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's a sad day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have liked}} it so much," [...] {{answered}} Fan. [...] "I {{like to be}} with you so much, because"--she hesitated a little <b>and</b> <b>then</b> finished--"because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that you like me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could hold}} my head up under two thousand, of a sartainty. I wish {{the place was}} a little nearer Clawbonny, say eight or ten miles off; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> do <b>think</b> <b>I</b> should {{talk to the people}} about a trade." ...|$|R
6000|$|McFarlane then said: [...] "I'll {{just take}} a little turn {{to see that the}} horses are all right, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we'd better close in for the night." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{shall be}} here {{a week or}} so yet, at any rate, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> we [...] shall go {{straight}} home, Dick has lost so much time already.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you {{twist in}} that way you will make me pull the hair out of your head; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you will cease to {{entertain}} doubts of my substantiality." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dead!" [...] he gasped. [...] "Impossible. She {{who never}} dies--dead, {{how can it}} be?" [...] <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> perceiving, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> that his face was being watched by the mutes who had come running up, he checked himself, and motioned to them to carry us to the camp, which they did.|$|R
6000|$|... "He'll {{be taught}} to fence and box by and by, <b>and</b> till <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he will do very well without any lessons in mauling. Go and wash your faces; and remember, Dan, if you break any more of the rules again, you will be sent away. That was the bargain; do your part {{and we will do}} ours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Suppose we {{take her}} there, <b>then.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{the best way}} to do it would be thus, if you don't mind joining hands with me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{a weight}} off my mind," [...] he declared. [...] "I'll smoke one pipe, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I'll go to sleep. We'll make a {{start with the}} first loads as soon as it's light enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me {{take you}} in, sweetheart," [...] said Mortimer. [...] "I'll just {{put you in a}} {{comfortable}} chair with a nice cup of coffee, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I really must come out again and tramp about and think how perfectly splendid everything is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because {{the more}} brave men that go away the more horrid {{the country will}} become. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> a man is always the happier if he has {{something}} really to think of. Such a one as Captain Clayton {{does not want to}} go to balls." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Silverbridge {{is older}} now than <b>I</b> was <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{that makes it}} a very long time ago." [...] Lord Silverbridge was the Duke's eldest son.|$|R
5000|$|Pudge works {{harder than}} anyone I know, because he sets goals for himself <b>and</b> <b>then</b> follows through. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he's the {{ultimate}} professional. Former White Sox manager, Jim Fregosi ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what we will do, M. Henri," [...] said Chapeau, {{speaking}} to his master, [...] "we will put a mark upon them, so that if we catch them again, we may know them; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> do <b>think</b> {{it would be all right}} to hang them; or perhaps for the second time we might cut off their ears, and hang them the third time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is nothing}} but a mood," [...] he assured her. [...] "Those new worlds don't exist any longer. They {{generally}} consist of foreign watering places where the sheep and the goats house together now <b>and</b> <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I should play the game out, Lady Ruth, until--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why," [...] {{returned}} Staniford lightly, [...] "so do I; but it's for {{a different}} reason, I'm afraid. I should like such a voyage as this to go on forever. Now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it will; it seems always to have gone on. Can you remember when it began?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The animal {{shall not}} die," [...] {{said the old}} man, {{suddenly}} clearing his throat, {{in a manner that}} proved he felt the force of the appeal; [...] "but his voice must be smothered. Bind his jaws with the halter, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we may trust the rest to Providence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If Hurry knows {{anything}} of father's history, I would {{he had told}} it to me!" [...] she cried. [...] "Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> too, he was once a sailor, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> again <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he was not. If that chest were open, or if it could speak, it might let us into his whole history. But its fastenings are too strong to be broken like pack thread." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{sat up in}} bed by way of arousing this said brain: it was {{a chilly}} night; I covered my {{shoulders}} with a shawl, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> proceeded to <b>think</b> again with all my might.|$|R
6000|$|... "I fancy," [...] said he, [...] "that if I were to die, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> walk, <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> that my widow {{looked better}} {{in one of}} those caps than any other kind of head-dress." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Grace, [...] "can't you understand? You know father's {{habits and}} that Gerald is {{following}} him. You know our debts are mounting up and this can't go on. Some day {{we may be}} ruined <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Alan will seize his chance. Perhaps I'm imaginative--but such things happen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, dear!" [...] she sighed, rising, [...] "I don't see how it's {{going to}} end; it must end some time. Sometimes {{it seems as}} if I couldn't stand it another day, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of my duty as a mother and wife, and I think perhaps God {{intended}} this to be my cross." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's true; but one {{man will}} be more sensitive, more cowardly, if you will, than another; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> no one should stand who does not believe himself to have a fair chance. His doing so might {{probably}} mar his future prospects. How can I put myself in competition with such men as Uppinall and Minuses?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'd forgotten," [...] said Lawson. [...] "Just {{after you}} left he sent round a present for you. I thought you'd be coming back and I didn't bother about it, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> it worth sending on; but it'll come over to London {{with the rest of}} my things, and you can come to my studio one day and fetch it away if you want it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Wisbech's manner became confidential. [...] "It's a {{fact that}} has counted against me now <b>and</b> <b>then.</b> Besides, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you noticed my accent--it's {{distinctly}} provincial, and not like yours or Derrick's--as soon as I told you I was a relative of his. You see, I know my station. In fact, I'm almost aggressively proud of it." [...] He spread out {{his hands in a}} forceful fashion. [...] "It's a useful one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why that, my dear,' {{returned}} Mrs Nickleby, 'is {{just the}} point upon which I am not yet satisfied. During this sickness, {{she has been}} constantly at Madeline's bedside--never were two people so fond of {{each other as they}} have grown--and to tell you the truth, Nicholas, I have rather kept her away now <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's a good plan, and urges a young man on. He doesn't get too sure, you know.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There's the point. Now <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I see; {{but then}} I {{go off on}} a wrong tack: I get a silly fit, and a hopeless one, and lose my clue. And yet, after all, there is a highway; and wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein,' murmured Louis, as he gazed on the first star of evening.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought as}} much," [...] muttered the hunter. [...] "Those tracks were made last night. That Deer {{probably}} was lying down somewhere near here, and I {{might have had}} a shot but for that pesky Beaver. I'll just look the land over, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I'll wait here awhile. If that Deer isn't too badly scared, he may come back." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of old George Pollexfen, [...] In muscular youth {{well known}} to Mayo men [...] For horsemanship at meets or at race-courses, [...] That could have shown how {{purebred}} horses [...] And solid men, for all their passion, live [...] But as the outrageous stars incline [...] By opposition, square and trine; [...] Having grown sluggish and contemplative.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! let me see. I said I hadn't {{been at the}} Royal Society soiree {{for four}} years, and got him {{to tell me about}} some of the fresh Mendelian work. He loves the Mendelians because he hates all the big names of the eighties <b>and</b> nineties. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> remarked that science was disgracefully under-endowed, and confessed I'd had to take to more {{profitable}} courses. 'The fact of it is,' I said, 'I'm the new playwright, Thomas More. Perhaps you've heard--?' Well, you know, he had." ...|$|R
6000|$|She smiled {{slightly}} as she answered. [...] "I would my father were a mother, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> need not <b>think</b> such things. But, Dickory, {{if he had}} but written to me! And in all this time he might have written, knowing how I must feel." ...|$|R
5000|$|If <b>I</b> <b>think</b> before playing? Sometimes I do, {{but when}} I dribble {{a player and}} {{immediately}} another one appears, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> another... <b>I</b> can't <b>think</b> anymore because <b>I</b> do not feel like playing. So the legs take control to continue dribbling rivals Pedro Ochoa, 1928.|$|R
