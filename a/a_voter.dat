Secretary of State Gessler announced that Brooks did not have sufficient signatures to qualify for the ballot, leaving only Republican opponents on the ballot.|$|E

5|$|All officers, clerks, interpreters, {{candidates}} and candidates' agents at polling stations must maintain the secrecy of voting in stations. Before the poll is closed, {{they must not}} communicate to anyone the name of any elector who has not yet voted or his or her or identification number on the electoral register.

5|$|Bribery. Doing {{any one of}} {{a number}} of acts to induce a person to vote or refrain from voting or to reward him for having done so, such as giving or lending money; and giving or {{procuring}} an office or employment, amounts to bribery. It is also bribery for a person to procure or promise to procure that <b>a</b> <b>voter</b> exercise his vote in a certain way or that a candidate be elected as President in return for some inducement; to give money to someone else, knowing that he will use the money for bribery at an election; to accept an inducement for voting or not voting or agreeing to do so; and to induce a person to consent to being nominated as a candidate, or refrain or withdraw from being a candidate in return for some inducement.

5|$|During the {{election}} period, a candidate is {{not permitted to}} spend more than $600,000 or 30 cents for each person on the electoral register, whichever is the greater amount.

5|$|An {{additional}} eight {{members of}} the parliament are elected from the twelfth constituency. It encompasses the entire country; candidates in this constituency are elected by voters belonging to 22 recognized minorities in Croatia: the Serb minority elects three MPs, the Hungarians and Italians elect one MP each, the Czech and Slovak minorities jointly elect one MP, and all other minorities elect the final two MPs. Minority MPs are elected by simple plurality system (candidates with the most number of votes are elected). The nationality of the voters is listed in the voter registry, which {{is provided by the}} registrar's office that maintains Croatia's vital records. Voter nationalities are normally officially declared by the parents at birth, but any citizen may declare or change that information later on at the registrar's office at least 14 days ahead of elections (not at the polling station). The voter's nationality need not be declared or may be declared as unknown. During elections, voters who have officially declared they belong to one of the recognized minorities in Croatia may choose to vote for either a territorially applicable list or a corresponding national minority list; <b>a</b> <b>voter</b> of unknown or non-declared nationality may vote for either a territorially applicable list or any minority list; <b>a</b> <b>voter</b> who has declared a nationality other than Croat or a recognized minority may vote only for a territorially applicable list (the same as someone who has declared themselves a Croat).|$|E
