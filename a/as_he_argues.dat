25|$|In {{his work}} on the divine proportion, H.E. Huntley relates the feeling of reading and {{understanding}} someone else's proof of a theorem of mathematics to that of a viewer of a masterpiece of art—the reader of a proof has a similar sense of exhilaration at understanding as the original author of the proof, much <b>as,</b> <b>he</b> <b>argues,</b> the viewer of a masterpiece has a sense of exhilaration similar to the original painter or sculptor. Indeed, one can study mathematical and scientific writings as literature.|$|E
25|$|Chomsky's {{political}} writings {{have largely}} {{been focused on the}} two concepts of ideology and power, or the media and state policy. One of Chomsky's best-known works, Manufacturing Consent, dissects the media's role in reinforcing and acquiescing to state policies, across the political spectrum, while marginalizing contrary perspectives. Chomsky claims that this 'free-market' version of censorship is more subtle and difficult to undermine than the equivalent propaganda system that was present in the Soviet Union. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>argues,</b> the mainstream press is corporate owned and thus reflects corporate priorities and interests. Although acknowledging that many American journalists are dedicated and well-meaning, he argues that the choice of topics and issues featured in the mass media, the unquestioned premises on which that coverage rests, and the range of opinions that are expressed are all constrained to reinforce the state's ideology. He states that, although the mass media will criticize individual politicians and political parties, it will not undermine the wider state-corporate nexus of which it is a part. As evidence, he highlights that the U.S. mass media does not employ any socialist journalists or political commentators. He also points to examples of important news stories that have been ignored by U.S. mainstream media because reporting on them would reflect badly upon the U.S. state: For instance, it ignored the murder of Black Panther Fred Hampton with possible FBI involvement, the massacres perpetrated in Nicaragua by the U.S.-funded Contras, and the constant reporting on Israeli deaths while ignoring the far larger number of Palestinian deaths in the conflict between those two nations.|$|E
500|$|He {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} medicalization of certain conditions (or, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>argues,</b> of personhood), whereby pharmaceutical companies [...] "widen the boundaries of diagnosis" [...] before offering solutions. Female sexual dysfunction was highlighted in 1999 by {{a study published in}} the Journal of the American Medical Association, which alleged that 43 percent of women were suffering from it. After the article appeared, the New York Times wrote that two of its three authors had worked as consultants for Pfizer, which at the time was preparing to launch UK-414,495, known as female Viagra. The journal's editor said that the failure to disclose the relationship with Pfizer was the journal's mistake.|$|E

50|$|The {{command of}} the ford was given to Erkenbrand of the Westfold. However, until he arrived from Helm's Deep, Grimbold held the position. Elfhelm {{did not want to}} hold the Fords, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> that it {{provided}} little defence, but Grimbold was not willing to wholly abandon it, partially due to the tradition of Westfold. The two commanders later reached a compromise.|$|R
500|$|Ultimately, Locke wants {{children}} to become adults {{as quickly as}} possible. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> in Some Thoughts, [...] "the only fence against {{the world is a}} thorough knowledge of it, into which a young gentleman should be entered by degrees as he can bear it, and the earlier the better." [...] In the Second Treatise on Government (1689), he contends that it is the parents' duty to educate their children and to act for them because children, though they have the ability to reason when young, do not do so consistently and are therefore usually irrational; it is the parents' obligation to teach their {{children to}} become rational adults so that they will not always be fettered by parental ties.|$|E
500|$|An {{analogous}} {{case is that}} of the screwball comedy, {{widely accepted}} by film historians as constituting a [...] "genre": the screwball is defined not by a fundamental attribute, but by a general disposition and a group of elements, some—but rarely and perhaps never all—of which are found in each of the genre's films. Because of the diversity of noir (much greater than that of the screwball comedy), certain scholars in the field, such as film historian Thomas Schatz, treat it as not a genre but a [...] "style". Alain Silver, the most widely published American critic specializing in film noir studies, refers to film noir as a [...] "cycle" [...] and a [...] "phenomenon", even <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> that it has—like certain genres—a consistent set of visual and thematic codes. Other critics treat film noir as a [...] "mood", characterize it as a [...] "series", or simply address a chosen set of films they regard as belonging to the noir [...] "canon". There is no consensus on the matter.|$|E

To further hammer the point, in an early edition, actual science fiction writers wrote faux sincere [...] "admiring" [...] blurbs for Spinrad for the novel's back cover blurbs, praising [...] "Hitler's" [...] writing skills. Irony abounds in Whipple's review, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> author Hitler is {{obviously}} wrong in assuming that {{not much more than}} midnight rallies and phallic symbolism would create a large number of supporters for a movement.

50|$|Aarsleff's {{writings}} on Wilhelm von Humboldt caused controversy as they {{drew attention to}} the fact that Humboldt was heavily influenced by French philosophers and linguists, which was denied by established German scholarship. His {{writings on}} the French-Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure caused similar controversy, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> that Saussure’s central ideas were strongly influenced by the French 19th-century philosopher-critic Hippolyte Taine, which was denied by Saussure scholars, who maintain(ed) that Saussure’s ideas were all original.|$|R
2500|$|This is {{important}} in Duthie's theory of an Ur-Shrew insofar <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> it is the original version of The Shrew upon which A Shrew is based, not the version which appears in the 1623 First Folio. As Oliver argues, [...] "A Shrew is a report of an earlier, Shakespearian, form of The Shrew in which Hortensio was not disguised as Litio." [...] Oliver suggests that when Pembroke's Men left London in June 1592, they had in their possession a now lost early draft of the play. Upon returning to London, they published A Shrew in 1594, some time after which Shakespeare rewrote his original play into the form seen in the First Folio.|$|E
2500|$|Franta {{identified}} {{this response}} as the Toronto Principle, which, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>argues,</b> “aligns rhetoric and action. It {{suggests that it}} is all institutions’ responsibility to give life to the Paris agreement. Harvard could adopt this Toronto principle, too, and the world would be better for it.” Franta also identified how the Toronto Principle would be put into practice, which includes [...] "moving investments away from coal companies and coal-fired power plants, companies seeking non-conventional or aggressive fossil fuel development (such as oil from the Arctic or tar sands), and possibly also companies that distort public policies or deceive the public on climate. At present, these activities are incompatible with the agreement in Paris.” In adhering to the Toronto Principle, Franta argues that leading institutions can use their status and power to meaningfully respond to the challenge of climate change, and act based on the goals at the Paris Agreement.|$|E
2500|$|In {{her essay}} [...] "Sophistry about Conventions," [...] philosopher Martha Nussbaum argues that Stanley Fish's {{theoretical}} views {{are based on}} [...] "extreme relativism and even radical subjectivism." [...] Discounting his work {{as nothing more than}} sophistry, Nussbaum claims that Fish [...] "relies on the regulative principle of non-contradiction in order to adjudicate between competing principles," [...] thereby relying on normative standards of argumentation even <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> against them. [...] Offering an alternative, Nussbaum cites John Rawls's work in A Theory of Justice to highlight [...] "an example of a rational argument; it can be said to yield, in a perfectly recognizable sense, ethical truth." [...] Nussbaum appropriates Rawls's critique of the insufficiencies of Utilitarianism, showing that a rational person will consistently prefer a system of justice that acknowledges boundaries between separate persons rather than relying on the aggregation of the sum total of desires. [...] "This," [...] she claims, [...] "is altogether different from rhetorical manipulation." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{success of}} [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today" [...] led CBS Records to renew Jones' {{recording}} contract and sparked {{new interest in}} the singer. He {{was the subject of}} an hour-and-a-quarter-long HBO television special entitled George Jones: With a Little Help from His Friends, which saw him performing songs with Waylon Jennings, Elvis Costello, Tanya Tucker, and Tammy Wynette, among others. Jones continued drinking and using cocaine, appearing at various awards shows to accept honors for [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today" [...] arguably inebriated, like when he performed [...] "I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool" [...] with Barbara Mandrell at the 1981 Country Music Association Awards. [...] He was involved in several high-speed car chases with police, which were reported on the national news, and one arrest was filmed by a local TV crew; the video, which is widely available online, offers a glimpse into Jones' alter ego when drinking, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> with the police officer and lunges at the camera man. Conversely, when sober, Jones was known to be friendly and down to earth, even shy. [...] In a 1994 article on Jones, Nick Tosches remarked that when he first interviewed the singer in April 1976, [...] "One could readily believe the accounts by those who had known him for years: that he had not changed much at all and that he had been impervious to fame and fortune." [...] In an unusually unguarded self-appraisal in 1981, the singer told Mark Rose of The Village Voice, [...] "I don't show a lot of affection. [...] I have probably been a very unliked person among family, like somebody who was heartless. [...] I saved it all for the songs. [...] I didn't know you were supposed to show that love person to person. [...] I guess I always wanted to, but I didn't know how. [...] The only way I could would be {{to do it in a}} song." [...] Years later he commented to The Christian Broadcasting Network's Scott Ross about himself, [...] "I think you're mad at yourself, I think that you're sayin' to yourself 'You don't deserve this. [...] You don't deserve those fans. [...] You don't deserve makin' this money.' [...] And you're mad at yourself. [...] And you beat up on yourself by drinkin' and losing friends that won't put up with that...It's just one terrible big mess you make out of your life." [...] In 1982, Jones recorded the album A Taste of Yesterday's Wine with Merle Haggard; [...] while Jones, in the wake of his condition, appeared underweight on the album cover, his singing was flawless. [...] His run of hits also continued in the early 1980s, with the singer charting [...] "I'm Not Ready Yet", [...] "Same Ole Me" [...] (backed by the Oak Ridge Boys)", [...] "Still Doin' Time", [...] "Tennessee Whiskey", [...] "We Didn't See a Thing" [...] (a duet with Ray Charles), and [...] "I Always Get Lucky with You", which was Jones' last number one in 1984.|$|E
60|$|In {{those days}} of small things he fought his first duel, {{and made a}} study of Fear and Courage. His {{earliest}} impulse was to rush at danger; {{if he had to}} wait, he felt his courage oozing out at the tips of his fingers, like Bob Acres, but in the moment of peril he was himself again. In dreams he was a coward, because, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>argues,</b> the natural man is a poltroon, and conscience, honour, all the spiritual and commanding part of our nature, goes to sleep in dreams. The animal terror asserts itself unchecked. It is a theory not without exceptions. In dreams one has plenty of conscience (at least that is my experience), though it usually takes the form of remorse. And in dreams one often affronts dangers which, in waking hours, one might probably avoid if one could.|$|E
5000|$|The {{linguist}} M. Pittau {{argues that}} the Paleo-Sardinian language (or [...] "Sardian language") and the Etruscan language were closely linked, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> that they were both emanations of the Anatolian branch of the Indo-European. According to Pittau, the [...] "Nuragics" [...] were a population of Lydian origin who imported their Indo-European language to the island, pushing out the Pre-Indo-European languages spoken by the Pre-Nuragic peoples.|$|E

5000|$|Martin Luther {{rejected}} {{parts of}} the Roman Rite Catholic Mass, specifically the Canon of the Mass, which, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>argued,</b> did not conform with [...] That verse contrasts the Old Testament priests, who {{needed to make a}} sacrifice for sins on a regular basis, with the single priest Christ, who offers his body only once as a sacrifice. The theme is carried out also in , , and [...] Luther composed as a replacement a revised Latin-language rite, Formula missae in 1523 and the vernacular Deutsche Messe in 1526.|$|R
2500|$|Nations {{can agree}} to fix their {{exchange}} rates against each other, [...] and then correct any imbalances that arise by rules based and negotiated exchange rate changes and other methods. [...] The Bretton Woods system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates {{was an example}} of a rules based system. John Maynard Keynes, one of the architects of the Bretton Woods system had wanted additional rules to encourage surplus countries to share the burden of rebalancing, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> that they were in a stronger position to do so and <b>as</b> <b>he</b> regarded their surpluses as negative externalities imposed on the global economy.|$|R
5000|$|More recently, Philippe-André Rodriguez {{has argued}} that human dignity is best {{understood}} as an essentially contested concept. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>argues,</b> [...] "it seems that it is this {{very nature of the}} concept that has allowed, on the one hand, human rights to receive such international acceptance as a theoretical enterprise and, on the other hand, has led the concept to be constantly challenged by different cultures worldwide." ...|$|E
