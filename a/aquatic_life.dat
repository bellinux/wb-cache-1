5000|$|An {{aquatic weed}} harvester, {{also known as}} a water mower, mowing boat and weed cutting boat, is an aquatic machine {{specifically}} designed for inland watercourse management to cut and harvest underwater weeds, reeds and other <b>aquatic</b> plant <b>life.</b> The action of removing <b>aquatic</b> plant <b>life</b> in such a manner has been referred to as [...] "aquatic harvesting".|$|R
5|$|Although heavily polluted, {{the creek}} {{supports}} <b>aquatic</b> <b>life,</b> including coastal cutthroat trout (leopard spotted) in its upper reaches. Watershed councils {{such as the}} Fans of Fanno Creek and government agencies have worked to limit pollution and to restore native vegetation in riparian zones.|$|E
5|$|Cetaceans {{includes}} whales, dolphins and porpoises. They are the mammals most fully {{adapted to}} <b>aquatic</b> <b>life</b> with a spindle-shaped nearly hairless body, {{protected by a}} thick layer of blubber, and forelimbs and tail modified to provide propulsion underwater.|$|E

5000|$|Lifeguard {{certificates}} {{are defined}} separately by each organization - the entry level is [...] "Junior-Retter" [...] (junior rescuer) at the DLRG (the largest <b>aquatics</b> <b>life</b> saving {{organization in the}} world) and [...] "Juniorwasserretter" [...] (junior water rescuer) at the Wasserwacht (water rescue branch of the German Red Cross). Extended Lifeguard certificate grades can be obtained at three levels of the [...] "Rettungsschwimmabzeichen" [...] (rescue swimming badge) in bronze, silver and gold.|$|R

5|$|Approximately 100 {{dead fish}} were {{reported}} in two streams after fire retardant was accidentally dropped on them.

5|$|Sheet Harbour was {{the first}} {{community}} in North America to use a lime doser, which sprays limestone into the water, to lower acid rain levels, starting in September 2005 in the West River. It was successful in stabilizing the pH of the river at 5.5, a healthy level for salmon and other <b>aquatic</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{drainage}} basin of Nanticoke Creek is {{designated as a}} Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. In the 1970s, the Operation Scarlift report for the creek noted that the creek was almost entirely devoid of <b>aquatic</b> <b>life</b> due to low water quality. However, the creek had potential for fish life.|$|E

5|$|The {{middle and}} upper reaches of Tangascootack Creek are nearly devoid of life due to acid mine drainage. However, the {{headwaters}} have some <b>aquatic</b> <b>life,</b> as they are further upstream. Brook trout and three other species of fish inhabit the creek. 13 species of benthic macroinvertebrate also inhabit it.|$|E
5|$|The tadpoles feed on detritus, algae, and bacteria. Tadpoles in more {{advanced}} phases of development may show {{a preference for}} vegetable matter, but also scavenge or become carnivorous on <b>aquatic</b> <b>life.</b> Captive tadpoles have eaten boiled lettuce and pet food in pellet form. If population density is high, tadpoles have cannibalised one another.|$|E
5|$|A 2004-05 EPA {{study of}} the river rated the water quality 6 out of 100. The study also {{discovered}} that dissolved oxygen levels in the water were low because there were few organisms, poor sediment, and little plant life in the river. Although storm water from residential neighborhoods added dissolved oxygen, it also brought ammonia from fertilizer. The Army Corps of Engineers found that the channeling prevented <b>aquatic</b> <b>life</b> from sustaining itself; few fish naturally spawn in the river because of the cement casing and flume at its mouth.|$|E

5|$|A study {{conducted}} in 1999 for the City of Portland by researchers from Portland State University found that Johnson Creek had marginal conditions for macroinvertebrates, {{an important source}} of food for fish and other <b>aquatic</b> <b>life.</b> The study compared differences in these life forms and in water chemistry from two urban streams, Johnson Creek and Tryon Creek in southwest Portland, with two nearby rural streams and found that benthic communities in the urban streams were degraded compared to the regional reference creeks.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the main}} stem of Shamokin Creek is {{designated}} as a Warmwater Fishery, all of its tributaries are designated as Coldwater Fisheries. Some tributaries, such as North Branch Shamokin Creek and Quaker Run, lack fish life. However, several fish species have been observed in Carbon Run and downstream tributaries such as Trout Run, Bennys Run, Millers Run, and Lick Creek have supported healthy communities of <b>aquatic</b> <b>life.</b> Additionally, a small hatchery for fish is maintained {{at the mouth of}} Trout Run by local sportsmen.|$|E
5|$|An {{immediate}} concern of environmentalists was the potential {{use of chemical}} dispersants. To keep big slicks from washing ashore, dispersants {{can be used to}} break the oil into small droplets that disperse throughout the water column. There are significant concerns about the health effects of the dispersants and the effects on <b>aquatic</b> <b>life.</b> Coast Guard officials overseeing the cleanup indicated that no chemical dispersants were being used but did not immediately rule the use of them out.|$|E

5|$|For a long time, {{bivalves}} {{were thought}} to be better adapted to <b>aquatic</b> <b>life</b> than brachiopods were, outcompeting and relegating them to minor niches in later ages. These two taxa appeared in textbooks as an example of replacement by competition. Evidence given for this included the fact that bivalves needed less food to subsist because of their energetically efficient ligament-muscle system for opening and closing valves. All this has been broadly disproven, though; rather, the prominence of modern bivalves over brachiopods seems due to chance disparities in their response to extinction events.|$|E
5|$|Giant otter muzzles {{are short}} and sloping {{and give the}} head a ball-shaped appearance. The ears are small and rounded. The nose (or rhinarium) is {{completely}} covered in fur, with only the two slit-like nostrils visible. The giant otter's highly sensitive whiskers (vibrissae) allow the animal to track changes in water pressure and currents, which aids in detecting prey. The legs are short and stubby and end in large webbed feet tipped with sharp claws. Well suited for an <b>aquatic</b> <b>life,</b> it can close its ears and nose while underwater.|$|E
5|$|Initially, sauropods {{were thought}} to be mainly aquatic, inhabiting lush peat swamps and being captive to the {{buoyancy}} of water to support their giant body weights. In 1984, Cooper pointed out that Vulcanodon, the most primitive sauropod known at that time, lived in a desert like environment and therefore must have been terrestrial. This indicated that the large body size of sauropods, as already seen in Vulcanodon, had not evolved as an adaptation to an <b>aquatic</b> <b>life</b> style.|$|E
