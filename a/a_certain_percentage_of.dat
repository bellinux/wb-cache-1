5|$|According to the report, {{the average}} annual {{transfers}} from the national government to the municipalities for {{water supply and sanitation}} (including solid waste) were about US$278m between 1998 and 2001. 86% of that funding was allocated through the SGP as defined in Law 715. <b>A</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> these resources was dedicated exclusively for water supply and sanitation. They mainly go to small municipalities that show low income levels. Nevertheless, many municipalities use funding through SGP dedicated for water supply and sanitation for other purposes.|$|E
5|$|During the 1906 {{legislative}} session, Beckham urged {{investigation and}} prosecution of corrupt insurance companies, {{following the lead of}} New York attorney Charles Evans Hughes. In particular, he recommended reducing the practice of deferred dividends, which allowed the insurance companies to keep large stores of cash on-hand for illegal purposes. He further advocated that insurance companies doing business in the state be required to invest <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> their earnings in Kentucky, bolstering the its economy and providing policyholders some protection against fraud.|$|E

25|$|EU {{member states}} {{differ in the}} degree of worker {{involvement}} in corporate management. In Germany, most large corporations are required to allow employees to elect <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> seats on the supervisory board.

25|$|The CRTC's Canadian content {{regulations}} {{dictate that}} <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> a domestic broadcaster's transmission time must include content that {{is produced by}} Canadians, or covers Canadian subjects. These regulations also apply to US cable television channels such as MTV and the Discovery Channel, which have local versions of their channels available on Canadian cable networks. Similarly, BBC Canada, while showing primarily BBC shows from the United Kingdom, also carries Canadian output.|$|E
25|$|Both these {{arguments}} were {{strengthened by the}} greater urgency of winning the game, due to the former rule that the winning league attains home field advantage in the World Series. A number of compromises were suggested in the sports/news media as measures to mitigate these selection issues, including {{limiting the number of}} representatives a particular team could have; or requiring only that <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the 30 teams be represented; or expanding the size of the All-Star rosters.|$|E
25|$|Recent U.S. {{policy has}} {{generally}} been to provide an inflation-adjusted federal production tax credit (PTC) of $15 per MW·h (in 1995 dollars) generated for the first ten years of operation for wind energy sold.

The hit location {{is determined by the}} 'ones' digit of the same roll, and hand-to-hand combat damage is determined by the 'tens' digit. Weapon damage ignores the 'tens' of the first roll, and requires a second roll based on the weapon's characteristics.|$|R
50|$|Property Management systems allow local {{property}} {{managers and}} maintenance personnel manage {{the day-to-day operations}} of their properties. Property maintenance for commercial properties includes major focus areas such as risk management, maintenance, communication, and tenant satisfaction. Usually <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> agreed <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the rent payment will be deducted on each rent payment collected by the property management as their service fee. There are also other ways of charging the property owners using the service but percentage collection is the common one.|$|R
50|$|The UP, {{among other}} minor parties {{that had been}} losing votes in recent years, {{formally}} lost its legal representative status as a political party (personería jurídica) in September 2002 after that year's national elections, due to the application of new electoral laws that conditioned such a status (or the regaining of the same) to either the signing of a petition with 50,000 signatures or to obtaining <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> minimum <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> votes. Some UP members continue to identify themselves as such within the Social and Political Front.|$|R
25|$|For {{a limited}} period, <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> new housing in any {{development}} {{has to be}} sold to bumiputra owners.

There is no bumiputra discount on existing housing.|$|E
25|$|For a {{recycling}} program to work, having a large, stable supply of recyclable material is crucial. Three legislative options {{have been used}} to create such a supply: mandatory recycling collection, container deposit legislation, and refuse bans. Mandatory collection laws set recycling targets for cities to aim for, usually in the form that <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> a material must be diverted from the city's waste stream by a target date. The city is then responsible for working to meet this target.|$|E
25|$|Drift {{cars are}} usually light-to-moderate weight rear-wheel-drive coupes and sedans, {{offering}} a large {{range of power}} levels. There have also been all-wheel drive cars (AWD) that have been converted to rear-wheel drive such as Subaru WRX, Toyota Avensis as Scion tC, Mitsubishi EVO and Nissan GT-R. Early on AWD cars without conversion were allowed in some drifting competitions, usually the rules allowed only <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> power {{to be sent to}} the front wheels, but are banned in most (if not all) drifting competitions today.|$|E
50|$|With the {{agreement}} of a bonus, employees are involved with <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> share <b>of</b> the economic success of the company. It is a success fee, which is independent of {{the contribution of the}} employee's to the company's success. In contrast, target agreements must set the goals to be reached and influenced by the employee for his assistance. Still occurs {{at the end of the}} fiscal year to assess the performance of the employee will be decided by which, whether the objectives have been met or not. If it is solely on the sales performance of the Company, which is not much influenced by the employee, it is a bonus.|$|R
50|$|Year-over-base caps {{allow the}} cap to raise {{each year by}} <b>a</b> <b>certain,</b> {{predetermined}} <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pre-determined, initial (base) CAM charge. Year-over-year caps mean the percentage increase applies not to a base amount, but to the actual CAM charge of the previous year. Cumulative caps allow the yearly <b>percentage</b> increase <b>of</b> the CAM Cap to accumulate. Thus, a yearly 5% cap would grow the cap each year by 5%, so that the first year it was a 5% cap, the 2nd year a 10% cap, the third year 15, and so on. Compounded caps allow the yearly <b>percentage</b> increase <b>of</b> the CAM Cap to grow at a compounded rate each year.|$|R
5000|$|System Balancing and Exception Reporting : System {{balancing}} {{refers to}} built-in system checks {{to verify the}} integrity of data transferred from another application. Examples include a mechanism for comparing batch totals between an original data source and data transferred into a new application. Exception reporting relates to reporting of exception items to management so that more effective use of management time can be achieved. For example, the Sales Manager could potentially review all sales transactions for a day. But it is more time-efficient if the review and approval process is focused on transactions that are not sold at the list price, or sold above <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> pre-determined <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> discount.|$|R
25|$|Both minimum {{recycled}} content mandates and utilization rates increase demand directly by forcing manufacturers to include recycling in their operations. Content mandates specify that <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> {{a new product}} must consist of recycled material. Utilization rates are a more flexible option: industries are permitted to meet the recycling targets at any point of their operation or even contract recycling out in exchange for tradeable credits. Opponents to both of these methods point to the large increase in reporting requirements they impose, and claim that they rob industry of necessary flexibility.|$|E
25|$|Woodworking {{machinery}} that perform a similar function as hand planes include the jointer and the thickness planer, also called a thicknesser; the job these specialty power tools {{can still be}} done by hand planers and skilled manual labor {{as it was for}} many centuries. When rough lumber is reduced to dimensional lumber, a large electric motor or internal combustion engine will drive a thickness planer that removes <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> excess wood to create a uniform, smooth surface on all four sides of the board and in specialty woods, may also plane the cut edges.|$|E
25|$|A better {{approach}} {{seemed to}} be to offer carrots instead of sticks. In the first place captains were given some leeway by allowing them <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> missing troops, without consequences for their payment. Also, {{in some cases the}} nominal strength of companies was lowered intentionally, at the same time keeping the amount of payments constant, thereby giving the troops a pay rise in the bargain. But the best approach would be to have the government take over the entrepreneurial risks of the captain. However, this did only happen in the Republic in the reforms of William III after 1672.|$|E
2500|$|The Glasflügel H-201 Standard Libelle proved immensely popular, {{but was not}} {{an optimal}} {{aircraft}} for club and rental use, due to its mid-wing and low tail which could both be damaged in off-airport landings. Also its small cockpit fits only <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> demographic <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> soaring pilots. The company developed the 205 with the design goals of a simple, rugged aircraft that would withstand club and fixed-base operator rental use. The resulting aircraft has a high-wing and a T-tail to provide more obstacle clearance {{as well as a}} larger cockpit. To eliminate gear-up landings the monowheel landing gear is non-retractable, [...] although at least one Club Libelle exists (D-2468) which is equipped with retractable landing gear.|$|R
5000|$|The Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) is {{also the}} COP(or EER) {{expressed}} in BTU/W·hr, but instead of being evaluated at a single operating condition, it represents the expected overall performance for a typical year's weather in a given location. The SEER is thus calculated with the same indoor temperature, but over a range of outside temperatures from [...] to , with <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> specified <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> time in each of 8 bins spanning 5 °F (2.8 °C).

40|$|In several {{parts of}} the world {{livestock}} animals (sheep, goats and cattle) are identified with radiofrequency identification (RFID) devices. These transponders can be read with handheld and stationary readers. The reading can be performed on the farm, during transport, in the sales yard and in the slaughterhouse. Especially when the RFID tags are read with a static reader the signal strength the transponders produce is very important (reading distance shall be sufficient if animal passes the reader). If the signal is insufficient it can result in misreads. In many countries RFID tags have to meet certain approval criteria to get allowance for use for identifying <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> species with those tags. The approval is mostly based upon tests that are performed by test agencies on new tags that the manufacturer has send to the test agency. The tags the manufacturer later on sell on the market can have a different quality as the original tested product or the quality of the RFID tags can be influenced by environmental conditions e. g. moisture. The reduced quality can increase the misread percentage. In the most RFID schemes there are no checks performed that safeguard the quality of the products sold on the marked. Schemes that monitor the quality of RFID products on the market could be introduced. This monitoring could e. g. be based upon RFID sample tags that are collected during slaughter. When <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> the recovered tags are outside specification the manufacturer should improve the quality of his product. If the manufacturer e. g. within a year does not succeed {{to improve the quality of}} that product approval for that product could be withdrawn...|$|R
25|$|One of {{the methods}} to {{determine}} {{the performance of a}} heat sink is to use heat transfer and fluid dynamics theory. One such method has been published by Jeggels, et al., though this work is limited to ducted flow. Ducted flow is where the air is forced to flow through a channel which fits tightly over the heat sink. This makes sure that all the air goes through the channels formed by the fins of the heat sink. When the air flow is not ducted, <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> air flow will bypass the heat sink. Flow bypass was found to increase with increasing fin density and clearance, while remaining relatively insensitive to inlet duct velocity.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, the Canadian export {{pipeline}} system began to become overloaded with new oil production. As a result, Enbridge implemented pipeline apportionment on its southbound lines, and Kinder Morgan on its westbound line. This rationed pipeline space {{by reducing the}} monthly allocation of each shipper to <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> its requirements. The Chevron Corporation Burnaby Refinery, the last remaining oil refinery on Canada's west coast, applied to the NEB for preferential access to Canadian oil since American refineries in Washington and California were outbidding it for pipeline space, but was denied because it would violate NAFTA equal access to energy rules. Similarly, new North Dakota tight oil production began to block new Canadian production from using the Enbridge, Kinder Morgan, and TransCanada southbound systems.|$|E
25|$|SOA administers exam MLC, {{which covers}} life {{contingencies}} topics. Starting in May 2014, MLC includes both multiple choice and open-response questions. SOA made this change because, in their view, strict multiple-choice questions {{are not sufficient}} or adequate to test whether the candidates are familiar and fluent in the material. The test is four-hours long, allows calculators, and is administered via a paper-and-pencil format. Multiple choice questions account for 40% of the exam, and open-response questions account for 60% of the exam. Candidates may freely move between the two sections. The two sections are graded separately. However, since the multiple-choice questions are easier, only candidates who have answered <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the multiple-choice questions correctly have their written answers graded.|$|E
40|$|An {{instrumentation}} {{and computer}} system which {{offers the potential}} for analyzing photogeographic distributions is described.

5000|$|Price-pack/Bonus packs deal: The {{packaging}} offers <b>a</b> consumer <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> more <b>of</b> {{the product}} {{for the same}} price (for example, 25 percent extra). This is another type of deal “in which customers are offered more of the product for the same price”. For example, a sales company may offer their consumers a bonus pack {{in which they can}} receive two products for the price of one. In these scenarios, this bonus pack is framed as a gain because buyers believe that they are obtaining a free product. [...] The purchase of a bonus pack, however, is not always beneficial for the consumer. Sometimes consumers will end up spending money on an item they would not normally buy had it not been in a bonus pack. As a result, items bought in a bonus pack are often wasted and is viewed as a “loss” for the consumer.|$|R
25|$|Another {{institutional}} {{factor that}} may have an important effect is proportionality, i.e., how closely the legislature reflects {{the views of the}} populace. Under a pure proportional representation system the composition of the legislature is fully proportional to the votes of the populace and a voter can be sure that he will be represented in parliament, even if only from the opposition benches. (However many nations that utilise a form of proportional representation in elections depart from pure proportionality by stipulating that smaller parties are not supported by <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> threshold <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> votes cast will be excluded from parliament.) By contrast, a voting system based on single seat constituencies (such as the plurality system used in North American, the UK and India) will tend to result in many non-competitive electoral districts, in which the outcome is seen by voters as a foregone conclusion.|$|R
