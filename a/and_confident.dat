5|$|People {{with cancer}} who are {{confident}} in their understanding of their condition and its treatment, <b>and</b> <b>confident</b> {{in their ability to}} (a) control their symptoms, (b) collaborate successfully with their informal carers and (c) communicate effectively with health care providers experience better pain outcomes. Physicians should therefore take steps to encourage and facilitate effective communication, and should consider psychosocial intervention.|$|E
5|$|The {{birth of}} an heir {{produced}} changes in PedroII's character. Previously isolated and shy, {{he became more}} outgoing <b>and</b> <b>confident</b> as monarch. His strained relationship with his wife, {{the product of a}} disappointing arranged marriage, also improved, and with children came shared domestic interests that developed into an affectionate friendship.|$|E
5|$|Angkor Wat is {{the prime}} example of the {{classical}} style of Khmer architecture—the Angkor Wat style—to which it has given its name. By the 12th century Khmer architects had become skilled <b>and</b> <b>confident</b> {{in the use of}} sandstone (rather than brick or laterite) as the main building material. Most of the visible areas are of sandstone blocks, while laterite was used for the outer wall and for hidden structural parts. The binding agent used to join the blocks is yet to be identified, although natural resins or slaked lime has been suggested.|$|E
50|$|The {{main idea}} of the telenovela is a plot of revenge by 3 {{brothers}} who {{used to live in}} the countryside, whose father was ruined by a businessman who took his farms. For this purpose they move to Buenos Aires and work near him, in order to become his friends <b>and</b> <b>confidents,</b> <b>and</b> avenge his father by sabotaging his political career. The love stories of the show torn the characters between their sentiments and their loyalty to the plan.|$|R

5|$|On 8 January 1999, Pakistan's Judicial Commission held {{a hearing}} in Melbourne into bribery and match-fixing. The {{commission}} had originally summoned Waugh and Warne to Pakistan but the ACB instead decided to offer them court privileges in Australia. Both Warne and Waugh gave evidence at the public hearing. Waugh seemed nervous and uncertain, whereas Warne appeared assured <b>and</b> <b>confident.</b> They were questioned for approximately 80 and 45 minutes respectively. The Pakistani investigators attempted to link the Australians' dealings with John to various games between Pakistan and Australia in 1994, over which they had suspicions of match-fixing.|$|E
5|$|On the Persian side, Kardarigan {{was also}} eager to fight <b>and</b> <b>confident</b> of victory. He {{arranged}} to be escorted by many camels carrying water for his troops {{in case the}} Byzantines refused to engage but continued to block access to the Arzamon, and had allegedly prepared iron bars and chains for the prisoners he would take. His movements, however, were detected when the Byzantines' Arab foederati captured {{a few of his}} men, allowing Philippicus to prepare his forces. This early warning was of particular importance since Kardarigan intended to attack on Sunday, a day of rest for the Christian Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|Rigmor Mydtskov (1925–2010) was a Danish court {{photographer}} who is remembered both for her portraits of artists performing in Danish theatres {{but also for}} her many portraits of Queen Margrethe {{and other members of}} the Danish royal family. Realizing that people in such positions tend to act as if masked, she sought to portray the person behind the mask, although she often succeeded in maintaining a little of the secrecy. As a portrait photographer, she was gentle, intuitive <b>and</b> <b>confident.</b> Her life's work is a result of a constant, concentrated effort.|$|E

5|$|After {{a series}} of {{perceived}} provocations from Prussia, culminating in the offer of the Spanish crown to the Prussian Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern, the French emperor Napoleon III declared war on 15 July 1870. Initially, this step was supported by an outbreak of patriotic fervour <b>and</b> <b>confident</b> expectations of victory. Bizet, along with other composers and artists, joined the National Guard and began training. He was critical of the antiquated equipment with which {{he was supposed to}} fight; his unit's guns, he said, were more dangerous to themselves than to the enemy. The national mood was soon depressed by news of successive reverses; at Sedan on 2 September, the French armies suffered an overwhelming defeat; Napoleon was captured and deposed, and the Second Empire came to a sudden end.|$|E
5|$|Donna was {{originally}} portrayed as an obsessive fan of musician Ty Harper (Dean Geyer) {{and someone who}} had a desire for friends and acceptance. After befriending the teens of Ramsay Street, Donna changes her ways and matures into a warm, loveable girl. She {{has been described as}} being fiery, beautiful, kooky <b>and</b> <b>confident.</b> The character's storylines have seen her develop a relationship with Ringo Brown (Sam Clark), kissing Sunny Lee (Hany Lee), deal with the arrival of her family, searching for her biological father and having an affair with Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith). The character became popular with viewers and Robbie earned various award nominations for her portrayal of Donna, including two Logie Award nominations.|$|E
5|$|His {{tactic of}} diving into {{opposing}} formations often found him {{under fire from}} all directions, resulting in his aircraft being damaged beyond repair; consequently, Eduard Neumann was losing his patience. Marseille persisted, and created a unique self-training programme for himself, both physical and tactical, which resulted not just in outstanding situational awareness, marksmanship <b>and</b> <b>confident</b> control of the aircraft, but also in a unique attack tactic that preferred a high angle deflection shooting attack and shooting at the target's front from the side, instead of the common method of chasing an aircraft and shooting at it directly from behind. Marseille often practiced these tactics {{on the way back}} from missions with his comrades. Marseille became known as a master of deflection shooting.|$|E

After his teens he moved to Rome and Naples when, as a priest, became one of the most close confessors <b>and</b> <b>confidents</b> of Isabella della Rovere, Princesse of Bisignano, member of the Sanseverino family.|$|R
5|$|In 1860, Edward {{undertook}} {{the first}} tour of North America by a Prince of Wales. His genial good humour <b>and</b> <b>confident</b> bonhomie made the tour a great success. He inaugurated the Victoria Bridge, Montreal, across the St Lawrence River, {{and laid the}} cornerstone of Parliament Hill, Ottawa. He watched Charles Blondin traverse Niagara Falls by highwire, and stayed for three days with President James Buchanan at the White House. Buchanan accompanied the Prince to Mount Vernon, to pay his respects at the tomb of George Washington. Vast crowds greeted him everywhere. He met Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Oliver Wendell Holmes. Prayers for the royal family were said in Trinity Church, New York, {{for the first time}} since 1776. The four-month tour throughout Canada and the United States considerably boosted Edward's confidence and self-esteem, and had many diplomatic benefits for Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|In India, {{unaware of}} the delayed {{shipment}} <b>and</b> <b>confident</b> {{of being able to}} rally the Indian sepoy, the plot for the mutiny took its final shape. Under the plans, the 23rd Cavalry in Punjab was to seize weapons and kill their officers while on roll call on 21 February. This was to be followed by mutiny in the 26th Punjab, which was to be the signal for the uprising to begin, resulting in an advance on Delhi and Lahore. The Bengal cell was to look for the Punjab Mail entering the Howrah Station the next day (which would have been cancelled if Punjab was seized) and was to strike immediately.|$|E
5|$|Mary was {{depicted}} by Jacobites as an unfaithful daughter who destroyed her father {{for her own}} and her husband's gain. In {{the early years of}} their reign, she was often seen as completely under the spell of her husband, but after she had temporarily governed alone during his absences abroad, she was portrayed as capable <b>and</b> <b>confident.</b> Nahum Tate's A Present for the Ladies (1692) compared her to Queen Elizabeth I. Her modesty and diffidence were praised in works such as A Dialogue Concerning Women (1691) by William Walsh, which compared her to Cincinnatus, the Roman general who took on a great task when called to do so, but then willingly abandoned power.|$|E

5|$|The British defeat was {{the worst}} the Royal Navy {{suffered}} during the entire war, and it left the Indian Ocean and its vital trade convoys exposed to attack from Hamelin's frigates. In response, the British authorities sought to reinforce the squadron on Île Bourbon under Josias Rowley by ordering all available ships to the region, but this piecemeal reinforcement resulted {{in a series of}} desperate actions as individual British ships were attacked by the more powerful <b>and</b> <b>confident</b> French squadron. In December 1810 an adequate reinforcement was collected, with the provision of a strong battle squadron under Admiral Albemarle Bertie, that rapidly invaded and subdued Isle de France.|$|E
5|$|Precautions {{were taken}} to prevent secrets from the season finale being revealed; only certain staff members were {{provided}} with copies of the episode, which were given on watermarked DVDs and distributed to secret hiding places. The writers wanted Michael {{to have a big}} plan to get Holly back, but to realize throughout {{the course of the day}} that his relationship with Holly was something special and that he did not want to disrupt it; they felt it showed that Michael had become more mature, calm <b>and</b> <b>confident</b> about this relationship than that of Jan Levinson and others in his past. The first scene with Michael and Holly discussing their sketch possibilities in a secluded area was filmed with three cameras: one focusing on each side of the two actors, and one from the front of both of them to establish that the picnic was still going on behind them. Due to space limitations, the latter angle was filmed through a mirror (with the actors appearing to be opposite sides) and then the image was reversed and undistorted in post-production.|$|E
5|$|With {{the other}} females not {{selected}} for immediate death, Frank {{was forced to}} strip naked to be disinfected, had her head shaved, and was tattooed with an identifying number on her arm. By day, the women were used as slave labour and Frank was forced to haul rocks and dig rolls of sod; by night, they were crammed into overcrowded barracks. Some witnesses later testified Frank became withdrawn and tearful when she saw children being led to the gas chambers; others reported that more often she displayed strength and courage. Her gregarious <b>and</b> <b>confident</b> nature allowed her to obtain extra bread rations for her mother, sister, and herself. Disease was rampant; before long, Frank's skin became badly infected by scabies. The Frank sisters were moved into an infirmary, which {{was in a state}} of constant darkness and infested with rats and mice. Edith Frank stopped eating, saving every morsel of food for her daughters and passing her rations to them through a hole she made at the bottom of the infirmary wall.|$|E
40|$|The Respondent-Generated Intervals {{protocol}} (RGI) {{has been}} used to have respondents recall the answer to a factual question by giving not only a point estimate but also bounds within which they feel it is almost certain that the true value of the quantity being reported upon falls. The RGI protocol is elaborated in this article with the goal of improving the accuracy of the estimators by introducing cueing mechanisms to direct <b>confident</b> (<b>and</b> thus presumably accurate) respondents to give shorter intervals <b>and</b> less <b>confident</b> (<b>and</b> thus presumably less accurate) respondents to give longer ones...|$|R

5|$|Engaged in {{conflict}} with their original employers, the Byzantine Empire, the Catalan Company had traversed the southern Balkans and arrived in southern Greece in 1309. The new Duke of Athens, Walter of Brienne, hired them to attack the Greek ruler of neighbouring Thessaly. Although the Catalans conquered much of the region for him, Walter refused to pay them the salaries owed, and prepared to forcibly expel them from their gains. The two armies met at Halmyros in southern Thessaly (or at the Boeotic Cephissus, near Orchomenos, according to an earlier interpretation). The Catalans were considerably outnumbered and weakened by the reluctance of their Turkish auxiliaries to fight. The Company did {{have the advantage of}} selecting the battleground, positioning themselves behind marshy terrain, which they further inundated with water. On the Athenian side, many of the most important lords of Frankish Greece were present and Walter, a prideful man <b>and</b> <b>confident</b> in the prowess of his heavy cavalry, proceeded to charge headlong against the Catalan line. The marsh impeded the Frankish attack and the Catalan infantry stood firm. The Turks, seeing that battle was joined in earnest, re-joined the Company, and the Frankish army was routed; Walter and almost the entire knighthood of his realm fell in the field. As a result of the battle, the leaderless Duchy of Athens was taken over by the Catalans, who ruled that part of Greece until the 1380s.|$|E
