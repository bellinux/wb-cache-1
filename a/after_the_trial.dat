5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> it was {{disclosed}} that pornographic images of {{children had been}} found on Tabak's laptop. In December 2013, the Crown Prosecution Service {{announced that he would}} be prosecuted for possessing the images. On 2 March 2015, Tabak pleaded guilty to possessing more than 100 indecent images of children, and was sentenced to 10 months in prison, to run concurrently with his existing life sentence for murder.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} that he {{developed}} the Baby Bombard and sent it off the War Office, Blacker was working for a government department known as MD1, which was given the task of developing and delivering weapons for use by guerilla and resistance groups in Occupied Europe. Shortly <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> of the Baby Bombard, Blacker was posted to other duties, and left the anti-tank weapon {{in the hands of a}} colleague in the department, Major Millis Jefferis.|$|E
5|$|De Iniusta is {{actually}} a composite work. The account of the trial itself, often termed the Libellus, is {{the central part of}} the work, and is probably the original account. To the Libellus was added an introduction which summarises St-Calais' career prior to the trial. A conclusion which relates the bishop's life <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> is appended to the end of the work. The introduction and conclusion are often referred to as the Vita, or Life.|$|E

Because of their top placements, Johnson and Liukin were {{named to the}} 2008 U.S. Olympic gymnastics team immediately <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trials.</b> <b>The</b> other four 2008 team members earned their spots after two additional selection camps.|$|R
5|$|Du Bois was bitterly {{disappointed}} {{that many of}} his colleaguesparticularly the NAACPdid not support him during his 1951 PIC trial, whereas working class whites and blacks supported him enthusiastically. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial,</b> Du Bois lived in Manhattan, writing and speaking, and continuing to associate primarily with leftist acquaintances. His primary concern was world peace, and he railed against military actions, such as the Korean War, which he viewed as efforts by imperialist whites to maintain colored people in a submissive state.|$|E
5|$|The Tan Chay Wa's {{tombstone}} {{trial was}} {{a sequence of}} unusual events regarding an inscribed tombstone of a political dissident, Tan Chay Wa, that sparked a court case in Singapore in 1983. His older brother Tan Chu Boon {{was arrested and charged}} on suspicion that he designed an elaborate but 'subversive' tombstone, which had engraved on it words glorifying the communist cause. The story of the case was later taken up in London by The Sunday Times a few months <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial,</b> making the case an internationally known issue.|$|E
5|$|The only {{surviving}} {{record of}} the trial is the speech given by Theomnestus and Apollodorus against Neaira and Stephanus, and the outcome is unknown. No records of Neaira exist <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial.</b> Modern commentators have noted the weaknesses in Apollodorus' arguments, though as the outcome of an Athenian trial depended heavily on what the parties involved could persuade the jury to accept, {{and how much of}} their dishonesty they could get away with, we cannot say for certain that the suit failed.|$|E

5|$|The work {{consists}} of three sections, an introduction, a central section that details the trial itself, and a conclusion. The introduction and conclusion summarise St-Calais' career before and <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial.</b> Although {{the authenticity of the}} main account has been challenged in the past, most historians consider it a contemporary record of the trial. Six manuscripts containing the work survive, and it was first printed in 1655, with other editions, including translations, appearing after that.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial,</b> Kenealy instigated {{a popular}} radical reform movement, the Magna Charta Association, which championed the Claimant's cause for some years. Kenealy {{was elected to}} Parliament in 1875 as a radical {{independent}} but was not an effective parliamentarian. The movement was in decline when the Claimant was released in 1884, {{and he had no}} dealings with it. In 1895, he confessed to being Orton, only to recant almost immediately. He lived generally in poverty {{for the rest of his}} life and was destitute at the time of his death in 1898. Although most commentators have accepted the court's view that the Claimant was Orton, some analysts believe that an element of doubt remains as to his true identity and that, conceivably, he was Roger Tichborne.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial,</b> Manoj and Babli, {{accompanied}} {{by a team of}} five police officers assigned to them for protection, left for Chandigarh. The police left them at Pipli and slipped away. Suspecting foul play, Manoj and Babli did not continue toward Chandigarh, instead boarding a bus for Karnal. According to a statement filed by Chanderpati, later that day, around 3:40pm, she received a call from a Pipli telephone booth from Manoj, who said that the police had deserted them, and Babli's family members were trailing them, so they would try to take a bus to Delhi and call her back later. Babli asked for acceptance from Chanderpati, who replied affirmatively. That was the last time Manoj's family heard from the couple.|$|E

5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial,</b> doubts {{were raised}} {{about both the}} story of the {{stepmother}}'s dreams and the fate of Maria and William's child. The stepmother was only a year older than Maria, and it was suggested that she and Corder had been having an affair and that the two had planned the murder to dispose of Maria so that it could continue without hindrance. Her dreams had started only a few days after Corder married Moore, and it was suggested that jealousy was the motive for revealing the body's resting place and that the dreams were a simple subterfuge.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} is to test respondents at the researcher's facility with opening statements or a full-blown mock trial instead of reading a case summary over the telephone. The higher cost of a mock trial allows for a more realistic portrayal of the real trial and (researchers hope) more accurate data. It also provides a better opportunity to question the subjects, before and <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> simulation. On the other hand, telephone surveys provide a larger and more representative sample of the jury pool. Diamond indicates that since both methods have advantages, SJS practitioners commonly rely on both in the same case.|$|E
5|$|At {{a special}} session of {{government}} held on 30 August 1944 in PaveliÄ‡'s villa, guarded by armed men, LorkoviÄ‡ and VokiÄ‡ were accused of conspiracy against the Poglavnik and Croatia's German ally. Vice President of the Government, DÅ¾afer KulenoviÄ‡, and many others defended them but to no avail. LorkoviÄ‡ was kept under house arrest until he was tried before the Poglavnik's Bodyguard Division (PTS) where {{it was decided that}} he would be stripped of his rank and expelled from the PTS. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial,</b> he was transferred to Koprivnica and later in Lepoglava, alongside VokiÄ‡, Farolfi, Ljudevit TomaÅ¡iÄ‡ and others, although KoÅ¡turiÄ‡ later escaped. LorkoviÄ‡ was executed at the end of April 1945.|$|E

In <b>the</b> years <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials,</b> he became an increasingly vehement defender of them. At the request of then Lt.-Gov. Stoughton, Mather wrote Wonders of the Invisible World during <b>the</b> <b>trials,</b> which were published in 1693. The book contained a few of Mather's sermons, {{the conditions of the}} colony and a description of witch trials in Europe. He somewhat clarified the contradictory advice he had given in Return of the Several Ministers, by defending the use of spectral evidence. Wonders of the Invisible World appeared {{at the same time as}} Increase Mather's Cases of Conscience." ...|$|R
5|$|Malkin Tower is {{believed}} to have been near the village of Newchurch in Pendle, or possibly in Blacko on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm, and to have been demolished soon <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials.</b>|$|R
5|$|During and <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial,</b> {{questions}} were {{raised about the}} fairness and legality of the court-martial proceedings. Owing to public pressure, the United States Navy reconvened the courts-martial board in 1945; the court affirmed the guilt of the convicted men. Widespread publicity surrounding the case {{turned it into a}} cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre among certain Americans; it and other race-related Navy protests of 1944â€“45 led the Navy to change its practices and initiate the desegregation of its forces beginning in February 1946. In 1994, the Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial was dedicated to the lives lost in the disaster.|$|E
5|$|Rindt was {{pronounced}} dead {{on the way to}} hospital and Lotus withdrew all cars from the race, including the Lotus 72 entered by Rob Walker. The Grand Prix went ahead and Clay Regazzoni took his maiden victory, but celebrations were muted. There was a lengthy investigation into Rindt's death in Italy, leading to a trial against Colin Chapman; he was cleared of all charges in 1976. The destroyed Lotus 72 remained in Italy <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial,</b> going to a scrapyard near Monza. In 1985, a real estate agent found the wreckage and bought it from the authorities, later trading it in 1993 for a Lola Formula 3 car. Since then, the car has rested in a garage near Milan.|$|E
5|$|Shakur {{personally}} cross-examined the witnesses, getting White {{to admit}} that he had once been in love with her; the same day, one juror (who had been frequently napping during the trial) was replaced with an alternate. During the retrial, the defendants repeatedly left or were thrown out of the courtroom. Both defendants were acquitted in the retrial; six jurors interviewed <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> stated that they did not believe the two key prosecution witnesses. Shakur was immediately returned to Morristown, New Jersey, under a heavy guard following the trial. Louis Chesimard (Shakur's ex-husband) and Paul Stewart, the other two alleged robbers, had been acquitted in June.|$|E
