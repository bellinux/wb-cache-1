25|$|Huxley {{used the}} setting and {{characters}} in his science fiction novel to express widely held opinions, particularly {{the fear of}} losing individual identity in the fast-paced world of the future. An early trip to the United States gave Brave New World much of its character. Not only was Huxley outraged by the culture of youth, commercial cheeriness and sexual promiscuity, and the inward-looking nature of many Americans, he had also found the book My Life and Work by Henry Ford on the boat to America, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> book's principles applied in everything he encountered after leaving San Francisco.|$|E
25|$|In {{his younger}} days Hume had studied some geology {{from the likes}} of Gideon Mantell and he {{appreciated}} the synthesis of ideas from other fields in ornithology. Hume included in 1872, a detailed article on the osteology of birds in relation to their classification written by Richard Lydekker who was then in the Geological Survey of India. The early meteorological work in India was done within the department headed by Hume <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> value of meteorology in the study of bird distributions. In a work comparing the rainfall zones, he notes how the high rainfall zones indicated affinities to the Malayan fauna.|$|E
25|$|John Roach {{meanwhile}} {{was planning}} to add shipbuilding to his engine building business, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> Morgan Iron Works with its dockyard on the East River as a stepping stone toward this goal. When in 1867 he offered to purchase the Morgan Works, Morgan was ready to sell, and the two agreed upon a price of $450,000, divided into a cash payment of $100,000 and two mortgages of $100,000 and $250,000. Roach would soon run into cash flow problems {{of his own and}} consequently defaulted on both mortgages; Morgan however chose not to foreclose and Roach settled the debts shortly before Morgan's death in 1878.|$|E

25|$|Ex-Governor Charles Robinson was {{an object}} of special search among them. He {{was one of the}} men they {{particularly}} wanted. During the whole time they were in town he was in his large stone barn on the hillside. He had just gone to the barn to get his team to drive out into the country, when he saw them come in and saw them make their first charge. He concluded to remain where he was. The barn overlooked the whole town, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> affair from beginning to end. Gangs of raiders came by several times and looked at the barn and went round it, but it looked so much like a fort, that they kept out of range.|$|E
25|$|His journey {{started when}} {{he studied the}} Qur'an in a literal way, and he slowly began to {{understand}} the principles lined in the religion. Then something happened to him in America to remove his doubts. He says; {{that while he was}} going to America, he was on the boat (ferry), <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> way the boat he was travelling in – was rocking in the huge sea – all under the control of Allah without it sinking or capsizing. At that point he realized the power of Allah. He said Iman (belief) entered into his heart due to this. His second scenario was in San Francisco, when he went on top of a mountain, and he could see the whole of creation in front of him, and he realized the beauty and harmony that existed amongst the creation as a whole. He said that, the sweetness of Iman hit him.|$|E
500|$|He {{supported}} {{political activist}} and labor leader Thomas Mooney's defense fund, but was repelled by {{the behavior of}} some of Mooney's supporters at a rally. Around the same time, he gave money for a Spanish Republican Army ambulance during the Spanish Civil War, which he put down to being [...] "a soft touch". This donation enhanced his liberal reputation. He also became involved in a [...] "liberal group...with a leftist slant," [...] along with Ronald Reagan. However, when Reagan <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> direction the group was heading, they resigned on the same night.|$|E

500|$|Kennan's {{influence}} rapidly decreased when Dean Acheson became Secretary of State, succeeding {{the ailing}} George Marshall during 1949 and 1950. Acheson did not regard the Soviet [...] "threat" [...] as chiefly political, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> Berlin blockade starting in June 1948, the first Soviet {{test of a}} nuclear weapon in August 1949, the Communist revolution in China a month later, {{and the beginning of}} the Korean War in June 1950 as evidence. Truman and Acheson decided to delineate the Western sphere of influence and to create a system of alliances.|$|E
500|$|In 1924, {{with plans}} for the C {{extension}} under development, Pick commissioned Charles Holden to design the station buildings in a new style. The designs replaced a set by the Underground's own architect, Stanley Heaps, which Pick had found unsatisfactory. Pick had first met Holden at the Design and Industries Association (DIA) in 1915, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> modernist architect as one he could work with to define what Pick called [...] "a new architectural idiom". Pick wanted to streamline and simplify {{the design of the}} stations to make them welcoming, brightly lit and efficient with large, uncluttered ticket halls for the rapid sale of tickets and quick access to the trains via escalators. At these new stations, tickets were issued from a number of [...] "passimeters", glazed booths in the centre of the ticket hall, rather than the traditional ticket office windows set to one side.|$|E
500|$|Jinks and Cohen {{involved}} Ball {{throughout the}} film's development, including casting and director selection. The producers met with about 20 interested directors, several {{of whom were}} considered [...] "A-list" [...] at the time. Ball was not keen on the more well-known directors because he believed their involvement would increase the budget and lead DreamWorks to become [...] "nervous about the content". Nevertheless, the studio offered the film to Mike Nichols and Robert Zemeckis; neither accepted. In the same year, Mendes (then a theater director) revived the musical Cabaret in New York with fellow director Rob Marshall. Beth Swofford of the Creative Artists Agency arranged meetings for Mendes with studio figures in Los Angeles to see if film direction was a possibility. Mendes came across American Beauty {{in a pile of}} eight scripts at Swofford's house, and knew immediately that it was the one he wanted to make; early in his career, he had been inspired by how the film Paris, Texas(1984) presented contemporary America as a mythic landscape <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> same theme in American Beauty, as well as parallels with his own childhood. Mendes later met with Spielberg; impressed by Mendes' productions of Oliver! and Cabaret, Spielberg encouraged him to consider American Beauty.|$|E

500|$|Misfortune awaited Bolt at {{the next}} major event, the 2005 World Championships in Helsinki. Bolt felt that both his work ethic and athleticism had much {{improved}} since the 2004 Olympics, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> World Championships {{as a way to}} live up to expectations, stating, [...] "I really want to make up for what happened in Athens. Hopefully, everything will fall into place". Bolt qualified with runs under 21 s, but he suffered an injury in the final, finishing in last place with a time of 26.27 s. Injuries were preventing him from completing a full professional athletics season, and the eighteen-year-old Bolt still had not proven his mettle in the major world-athletics competitions. However, his appearance made him the youngest ever person to appear in a 200 m world final. Bolt was involved in a car accident in November, and although he suffered only minor facial lacerations, his training schedule was further upset. His manager, Norman Peart, made Bolt's training less intensive, and he had fully recuperated the following week. Bolt had continued to improve his performances, and he reached the world top-5 rankings in 2005 and 2006. Peart and Mills stated their intentions to push Bolt to do longer sprinting distances with the aim of making the 400 m event his primary event by 2007 or 2008. Bolt was less enthusiastic, and demanded that he feel comfortable in his sprinting. He suffered another hamstring injury in March 2006, forcing him to withdraw from the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, and he did not return to track events until May. After his recovery, Bolt was given new training exercises to improve flexibility, and the plans to move him up to the 400 m event were put on hold.|$|E

2500|$|The {{focus on}} human history was an {{important}} element of the biblically grounded 16th-century theology of John Calvin. Calvin considered the first coming of Christ as the key turning point in human history. He viewed Christ as [...] "the one through whom salvation began" [...] <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> completion of Christ's plan of salvation as his death and Resurrection.|$|E

2500|$|Siegel {{wanted to}} become a {{legitimate}} businessman, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> chance in 1945 with William Wilkerson's Flamingo Hotel and Casino. Siegel named it the [...] "Flamingo" [...] after his girlfriend, Virginia Hill, because of her long-flamingo-like legs. During the 1930s, Siegel had traveled to Southern Nevada with Sedway on Lansky's orders to explore expanding operations; due to possible opportunities in providing illegal services to crews building the Hoover Dam. Lansky gave Nevada to Siegel, but Siegel turned it down and gave it to Sedway and went to Hollywood.|$|E

[...] The two ships, Astrolabe and Zélée, commanded by Charles Hector Jacquinot, were prepared for the voyage at Toulon.
