Room temperature adsorption of NO on the reduced Pt/SiO 2 catalysts mainly leads to molecular adsorption, {{accompanied by a}} small N 2 production. Infrared spectra reveal <b>adsorption</b> <b>bands</b> <b>at</b> 1780 and 1600 cm- 1, ascribed to the stretching vibrations of linearly and bridged bonded NO species, respectively. Furthermore, a weak <b>band</b> <b>at</b> 1935 cm- 1 is observed.

The as-prepared product shows several absorption bands, which are ascribed to some organic groups or ZnO. The strong <b>adsorption</b> <b>band</b> <b>at</b> 400 – 600  cm−[*] 1 originates from the stretching vibration mode of Zn–O {{in the low}} wavenumber region, demonstrating the formation of ZnO. The peak at around 800  cm−[*] 1 is assigned to the stretching vibration mode of OH bond in alcohol, and the absorption band {{in the range of}} 1020 – 1090  cm−[*] 1 belongs to C–OH bond, which indicates that the as-prepared samples contain a slight amount of polyol. The peaks at 1260 and 1727  cm−[*] 1 result from the stretching vibration of C–O and C=O bonds, which implies the presentence of ester or glycolate in as-prepared ones. Two absorption bands at approximately 1587 and 1413  cm−[*] 1 correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of C=O and C–O in the acetate (COO) groups, respectively [3, 20, 26]. A splitting between the asymmetric and symmetric carboxylate stretching bands (Δ) in the range 130 – 200  cm−[*] 1 is typical of bridging complexes [32]. Herein, the Δ value of 174  cm−[*] 1 suggests the bridging bonding mode in as-synthesized ZnO nano-clips. Additionally, the small absorption peak (denoted by *) at 1343  cm−[*] 1 is due to weakly bound acetic acid molecules, suggesting that slight acetic acid is adsorbed onto the surface of the as-synthesized ZnO nano-clips, in consistent with the previous reports [11, 26].|$|E
40|$|Poor {{indoor air}} quality {{is a source of}} adverse health effects. TiO 2 {{coatings}} deposited on well-illuminated surfaces, such as window panes, can be used to fully mineralize indoor air pollutants by photocatalysis. In such applications it is important to ensure stable photocatalytic activity {{for a wide range of}} operating conditions, such as relative humidity and temperature, and to avoid deactivation of the catalyst. In this thesis photocatalytic removal of the indoor-pollutant acetaldehyde (CH 3 CHO) on nanostructured TiO 2 films is investigated, and in particular it is proposed how such films can be modified and operated for maximum performance. Catalyst deactivation can be reduced by purposefully changing the surface acidity of TiO 2 by covalently attaching SO 4 to the surface. Moreover, the overall photocatalytic activity on anatase TiO 2 films can be improved by increasing the fraction of exposed reactive { 001 } surfaces, which otherwise are dominated by { 101 } surfaces. In the first part of the thesis mode-resolved in-situ FTIR is used to elucidate the reaction kinetics of CH 3 CHO adsorption and photo-oxidation on the TiO 2 and SO 4 – modified TiO 2 surfaces. Surface concentrations of main products and corresponding reaction rates were determined. Formate is the major reaction product, whose further oxidation limits the complete oxidation to gaseous species, and is responsible for photocatalyst deactivation by site inhibition. The oxidation reaction is characterized by two reaction pathways, which are associated with two types of surface reaction sites. On the sulfate modified TiO 2 catalyst fewer intermediates are accumulated, and this catalyst resists deactivation much better than pure TiO 2. A hitherto unknown intermediate – surface-bound acetaldehyde dimer with an <b>adsorption</b> <b>band</b> <b>at</b> 1643 cm− 1 was discovered, using interplay between FTIR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The second part of the thesis treats the effect of increasing the relative abundance of exposed { 001 } facets on the photocatalytic activity of anatase TiO 2 films prepared by DC magnetron sputtering. A positive effect was observed both for liquid-phase photo-oxidation of methylene blue, and for gas-phase photocatalytic removal of CH 3 CHO. In both cases it was found that the exposed { 001 } surfaces were an order of magnitude more reactive, compared to the { 101 } ones. Furthermore, it was found that the reactive films were more resilient towards deactivation, and exhibited almost unchanged activity under varying reaction conditions. Finally, a synergetic effect of SO 4 – modification and high fraction of exposed { 001 } surfaces was found, yielding photocatalysts with sustained high activity. The results presented here for facet controlled and chemically modified TiO 2 films are of interest for applications in the built environment for indoor air purification and as self-cleaning surfaces.

40|$|Lauterbach, JochenIn molecular-level {{catalytic}} investigations, discrepancies {{that exist}} between surface science observations under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions and industrial catalytic performance at higher pressures {{are referred to}} as the “pressure gap. ” For example, changes in the population of adsorption sites and variation in reaction mechanisms on catalyst surfaces have been observed as pressure increases above UHV conditions. This work addresses this pressure issue through the investigation of surface adsorption behavior of model catalytic systems over the range from UHV to atmospheric pressures using polarization modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRAS). Likewise, a “materials gap” exists between single crystal surfaces and the supported nanoparticle catalysts used industrially. This work also includes preliminary investigations exploring the use of the reverse micelle technique for catalyst synthesis in order to produce nanoparticles with well-controlled dispersion. Adsorption of CO on Pt(100) was investigated at elevated pressures using PM-IRAS measurements. At sample temperatures of 325 K, a linear C-O stretch (~ 2090 cm- 1) was observed. Peak sharpening and a frequency shift were observed for this CO <b>adsorption</b> <b>band</b> <b>at</b> higher pressures. At 325 K, the frequency shift increased with exposures between 1 and 200 Torr CO up to 6. 3 cm- 1. The full width half maximum of the IR band was observed to decrease by 27 % over the same range. These results suggest that dipole-dipole coupling effects {{play an important role in}} understanding the surface adsorption behavior in this system at higher pressures. A dipole-coupling model was applied to these experimental results. The model predicted CO surface coverages on the Pt(100) surface increasing from ~ 0. 7 at 1 Torr CO to ~ 0. 95 at 200 Torr CO. These results indicate that at higher pressures the CO surface coverage on Pt(100) is much greater than similar measurements obtained under UHV conditions. The predicted increases in surface coverage at higher pressures were verified through analysis of the integrated peak areas of the measured absorption bands. The calculated areas were observed to increase by up to 50 % in magnitude over the pressure range from 1 Torr CO to 200 Torr CO. Measurements obtained during reduction from a high-pressure environment indicate that high-pressure adsorption behavior is a mix of reversible and irreversible processes. Measured PM-IRAS spectra exhibit significant broadening and decreasing frequency with increasing sample temperature. These effects are consistent with phonon dephasing models for adsorbed molecules. Above certain sample temperatures, the absorption band associated with adsorbed CO is no longer observed in the measured spectra. This is attributed to CO dissociation at higher sample temperatures, resulting in carbon contamination of the Pt(100) surface. Subsequent spectra obtained after exposure of the system to oxidative conditions reveal the return of the absorption band corresponding to adsorbed CO. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) measurements also corroborate this finding by excluding desorption as a likely cause of the loss of the CO band. Adsorbed CO measured in a CO oxidation reaction environment exhibit reversible adsorption/desorption processes around CO desorption temperatures. In parallel to the above high-pressure studies, initial steps toward overcoming the materials gap were taken through the synthesis of Ru nanoparticles using the reverse micelle synthesis technique. Reverse micelles were created using a microemulsion consisting of butyl ammonium laurate-water-hexanes. Dynamic Light Scattering was used to characterize the reverse micelles, which exhibited tunable sizes ranging from 5 to 30 nm depending on the molar water-to-butyl ammonium laurate ratio used. Reverse micelles having a diameter of 6 nm were then used to produce Ru nanoparticles from a RuCl 3 precursor solution. The resulting Ru particles had a diameter of ~ 3 nm, as determined from Small-Angle X-ray Scattering measurements. These results are a promising first step towards the goal of examining well-controlled nanoparticle catalysts over a wide range of pressure conditions using PM-IRAS. This approach has the potential to bridge both the pressure and materials gaps, allowing for significant improvements in the comparisons of model catalytic investigations with industrial catalytic performance.

The major activity during this period is on FTIR absorption studies of Co/Cr catalysts using CO as a probe molecule. Transition metals cobalt and copper play significant roles in the conversion of syngas (CO + H 2) to liquid fuels. With a view to examine the nature of interaction between CO and metal, the FTIR spectra of CO adsorbed on Co-Cr 2 O 3 composites were investigated. The results indicate that as cobalt loading increases, {{the intensity of the}} CO <b>adsorption</b> <b>bands</b> increase and several vibrational modes seem to be promoted. Heat treatment of the sample revealed two distinct processes of <b>adsorption.</b> <b>Bands</b> due to physisorption disappeared while bands due to chemisorption not only increased in intensity but persisted even after desorption.

In this study, we have examined the extent of Mo isotope fractionation during anion-exchange chromatography and assessed the potential of this separation technique for further isotope enrichment of commercially available isotopically enriched molybdenum. The 60 cm wide molybdenum <b>adsorption</b> <b>band</b> was eluted from a 1. 8 m long (3 times 60 cm) chromatographic column, filled with strongly basic anion-exchange resin. It was observed that heavier Mo isotopes were preferentially eluted from the resin, resulting in an enrichment of heavier Mo isotopes {{at the front of}} the <b>adsorption</b> <b>band</b> and a corresponding depletion at the rear. An equilibrium isotope effect between dissolved and resin-bound chemical forms of molybdenum appears to be the cause of the Mo isotope fractionation observed. The height equivalent to a theoretical plate (HETP) was calculated to be 0. 25 mm, while the separation factor (alpha = R-resin/R-solution) was found to be 0. 99998 per atomic mass unit. These results show that molybdenum can, in principle, be further enriched isotopically by anion-exchange chromatography in a laboratory environment. However, achieving the highest degree of enrichment was confirmed to be very laborious. It has been estimated that in order to reach an increase in the abundance of Mo- 98 isotope from an original value of 98. 2 % to 99. 9 %, the molybdenum <b>adsorption</b> <b>band</b> would need to migrate over a distance of at least 400 m through the anion-exchange resin. Another interesting observation made in this study was that no mass-independent isotope fractionation was observed for molybdenum as a result of chemical exchange reactions on the anion-exchange resin...|$|R

The SWNTs/PPy core-shell results in thin n-p junctions which modify the PPy bandgap and reduce the work function of electrons. As a result of the strong coupling, Raman and IR spectra show that the PPy undergoes a transition from polaron to bipolaron state, i. e. , indicating an increase in the conductivity.

In the temperature range of 30 to 350 C, the decomposition of G 4 OH begins above 150 C with dehydrogenation of backbone. The presence of platinum and rhodium particles decreased the initial temperature of decay.

40|$|Site Identification on Heteropolyacid Catalysts using CO & CO 2 and Transmission & Diffuse Reflectance IR Spectroscopy Jutta Kröhnert, Friederike C. Jentoft, Robert Schlögl Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Fritz-Haber-Institute of the Max Planck Society Faradayweg 4 - 6, D- 14195 Berlin, Germany Introduction Heteropolyacid-based {{catalysts}} {{are used}} in the industrial production of methacrolic acid from methacrolein [1]. Unfortunately, the (thermal) stability and thus the lifetime of these catalysts is unsatisfactory. Activity and instability though may be unseparably linked; there are indications that not the heteropolyacid itself but a partially decomposed, not yet fully identified structure constitutes the active phase [2]. Here, we seek to identify the sites on structures formed in various thermal treatments of a family of catalysts consisting of H 4 PVMo 11 O 40 and its cesium salts. Infrared spectroscopy so far has been mainly used for the analysis of the constitution of heteropolyacids [3, 4]; few publications deal with site identification by adsorption of probe molecules such as pyridine [5] or CO [6]. We selected CO and CO 2 as probes in order to analyze for Lewis and Brønsted acidic and basic sites. Experimental H 4 PVMo 11 O 40 was prepared through dissolution of the according amounts of MoO 3 and V 2 O 5 in H 3 PO 4 and subsequent water removal. CsxH 4 -xPVMo 11 O 40 (x= 2 - 4) were obtained through addition of a Cs 2 CO 3 solution to the heteropolyacid solution in the desired stoichiometry and subsequent water removal. For transmission IR spectroscopy / CO adsorption, samples were pressed (320 MPa) into self-supporting wafers (˜ 25 mg cm- 3), activated in vacuum (final pressure 1 * 10 - 4 Pa) at 523, 673, or 773 K. Spectra were recorded with increasing CO pressure using a Perkin Elmer S 2000 at 4 cm- 1 resolution. For diffuse reflectance / CO 2 adsorption, samples were filled into a gold cup and activated in a flow of dry N 2 at 473 or 773 K. CO 2 was purged through the cell at 298 K for 30 min, gas phase CO 2 was removed by purging with N 2. Spectra were recorded at 1 cm- 1 resolution using a Graseby Specac "Selector" attachment with environmental chamber placed in a Bruker ifs 66. Results CO adsorption was only observed on Cs salts; the free acid had a surface area of < 5 m 2 g- 1 and yielded a wafer of poor transmission. Up to 5 different band positions can be identified after activation (Fig. 1). The <b>band</b> <b>at</b> 2163 cm- 1 is only pronounced with Cs 2 H 2 PVMo 11 O 40 activated at 523 K; it is attributed to CO adsorbed on OH groups [6]. The band is not observed after activation at 773 K, consistent with dehydroxylation. The <b>band</b> <b>at</b> 2152 cm- 1 arises from CO adsorbed on Cs+ [6]. The <b>band</b> <b>at</b> 2138 cm- 1 is often ascribed to physisorbed / liquefied CO. Such <b>bands</b> usually develop <b>at</b> elevated CO pressures once the bands of chemisorbed CO have been saturated. We detected this <b>band</b> <b>at</b> CO pressures of 0. 2 Pa and, as the band 2133 cm- 1, it may represent coordinatively unsaturated Mo/V cations. Only Cs 4 PVMo 11 O 40 showed <b>at</b> <b>band</b> <b>at</b> 2144 cm- 1 that is tentatively attributed to a second Cs+ species. CO 2 adsorption was observed on all samples. Carbonate formation was never observed, as expected for a weakly basic anion. The spectra revealed several bands from adsorbed CO 2. Fairly certain is the interpretation of the a <b>band</b> <b>at</b> 2341 cm- 1 as CO 2 adsorbing on Cs+. In analogy to the CO <b>adsorption,</b> a <b>band</b> <b>at</b> 2352 cm- 1, which was only observed for Cs 2 H 2 PVMo 11 O 40, is thought to arise from interaction with OH groups. A <b>band</b> <b>at</b> 2320 cm- 1 was only detected for Cs 4 PVMo 11 O 40 and H 4 PVMo 11 O 40, the low frequency may indicate adsorption of CO 2 on reduced metal cations. <b>Bands</b> <b>at</b> 2347 and 2332 cm- 1 may indicate further non-cesium Lewis sites. Both CO and CO 2 adsorption suggest the presence of weakly acidic Lewis sites on various HPA compounds after thermal treatment, indicating oxygen-deficient Keggin units. References [1] T. Okuhara, N.

40|$|Aurora ELK, a porous low-k SiCOH film {{deposited}} by CVD, {{was used}} to study the effect of UV curing. Samples were cured for various curing times {{and the purpose of}} this work is to observe the effects of UV curing on optical, mechanical and structural properties of the low-k film. We have used 1) ellipsometric porosimetry to determine the porosity and the pore-size distribution and 2) nitrogen purged UV ellipsometry in a range from 2 to 9 eV to observe the changes of the dielectric function of the cured material. Additional, FTIR and laser-induced surface acoustic wave measurements were performed. The effect of UV cure is to remove the porogen from the material and to improve the mechanical properties of the film. The skeleton reconstruction and hardening is followed by reduction of porosity and an increase of k-value. We measured ellipsometric spectra from 2 to 9 eV and observed an expected reduction of the <b>adsorption</b> <b>band</b> attributed to porogen, but also an undesired growth of an absorption <b>band</b> <b>at</b> 4. 5 eV.
