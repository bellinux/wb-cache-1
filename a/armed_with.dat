5|$|Both {{factions in}} Day of Defeat: Source {{have access to}} six classes. Each class is {{designed}} with specific combat circumstances in mind, so that teams must use teamwork to succeed. The weapons and equipment carried by the classes {{are based on the}} weapons used by both the US Army and Wehrmacht during World War II. Some of classes are <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> pistols—the American M1911 or the German Walther P38—while others are equipped with trench knives or entrenching tools for melee combat. Grenades are carried by a number of classes, depending on their role in the game—riflemen are equipped with rifle grenades, the assault classes are <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> a single fragmentation grenade and a smoke grenade for providing concealment, while support classes have access to two standard fragmentation grenades. Riflemen are <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> the M1 Garand or the Karabiner 98 kurz and are designed for medium to long range combat, while the assault classes carries the M1 Thompson or the MP40 which are only effective in close quarters. The support classes are designed for medium range combat, equipped with either the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle or the StG44. Snipers are used for attacking enemy targets from long range, and are consequently <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> the Springfield M1903 or the Karabiner 98k both equipped with long range scopes. Machine gunners carries the M1919 Browning or the MG42 to defend key locations on a level or to provide a base of fire for their team's advance. Machine gunners are required to deploy their weapons on bipods before firing in order to compensate for the machine gun's extreme recoil. The final class is <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> a Bazooka or a Panzerschreck, used in the game to displace enemy machine gun or sniper positions. This class is <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> either an M1 carbine or Mauser M712 to defend themselves with when moving.|$|E

5|$|Sydney was {{initially}} <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> thirty Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns: eighteen single mountings and six twin mountings. During her refit as a troop transport, the carrier's armament {{was reduced to}} four single Bofors.|$|E
5|$|T-26 model 1931: twin-turreted version <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> two DT tank machine guns. The first {{series-produced}} {{variant of}} the T-26 that was equipped with turrets differing from the initial Vickers design (Soviet turrets were higher and had an observation window). Tanks produced from 1931 to March 1932 had a riveted hull and turrets, a silencer affixed with two clamps, and lacked any cover over the air outlet window. About 1,177 T-26 mod. 1931 tanks <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> machine guns were accepted by the Red Army, which had 1,015 such twin-turreted tanks on 1 April 1933.|$|E

5|$|The {{resulting}} reforms {{helped shape}} the cavalry's contribution to the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), which was established with one cavalry division supported by two brigades of horse artillery. All would be trained for the mounted charge but would also be <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> rifles, the only major power to do so. The cavalry regiments were <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> Maxim Machine Guns, although these were replaced by Vickers Machine Guns from 1912. More than anything else, the issue of entrenching tools that were carried on the troop packhorses demonstrated how much the cavalry's doctrine had changed since the Boer Wars.|$|E

The 60cm torpedoes were the H8 type, which were 8m long and carried a 210kg (463lb) Hexanite warhead. The torpedoes had a range of 6,000m (6,550yd) when set at a speed of 36knots; at a reduced speed of 30knots, the range increased significantly to 14,000m (15,310yd).|$|E

5|$|As {{a clandestine}} army {{operating}} in an enemy-occupied country, and separated by {{over a thousand}} kilometers from any friendly territory, the Home Army faced unique challenges in acquiring arms and equipment. It was able to overcome these difficulties to some extent and to field {{tens of thousands of}} armed soldiers. Nevertheless, the difficult conditions meant that only infantry forces <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> light weapons could be fielded. Any use of artillery, armor or aircraft was impossible (except for a few instances during the Warsaw Uprising, such as the Kubuś armored car). Even these light-infantry units were as a rule <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> a mixture of weapons of various types, usually in quantities sufficient to arm only a fraction of a unit's soldiers.|$|E
