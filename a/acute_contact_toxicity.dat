Without adequate populations of honeybees the considerable production of these crops would be impossible. The insecticides sprayed on the crops cause great damage to honeybees and may have adverse effects on honey. For this purpose the <b>acute</b> <b>contact</b> <b>toxicity</b> (LC 50) of commonly used twelve different insecticides such as imidacloprid, acetamaprid, emamectin benzoate, thiamethaxam, spinosad, chlorpyrifos, profenofos, cypermethrin, bifenthrin, deltamethrin, carbosulfan and endosulfan was determined under laboratory conditions. The mortality of worker bees was checked after 3, 6, 12, and 24 hrs, respectively. For residues determination of insecticides in honey, 32 samples of raw honey of (Apis mellifera L. and Apis dorsata F.) were collected from eight districts including Multan, D. G. Khan, Layyah, Bahawal Pur, Faisalabad, Sahiwal, Chiniot and Sargodha of Punjab, Pakistan. After extraction of honey samples and cleaned up, the residues of these twelve different insecticides were determined by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC-UV). In insecticides bioassays {{the results showed that}} chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin and spinosad were highly toxic against A. mellifera L. with LC 50 values of 5. 5, 7. 8 and 13. 5 ppm after 24 hrs, respectively while emamectin benzoate, bifenthrin and carbosulfan were least toxic with LC 50 values of 88. 1, 82. 5 after 24 hrs their exposure to test bees.

40|$|International audienceDespite their indisputable {{importance}} {{around the}} world, the pesticides {{can be dangerous}} {{for a range of}} species of ecological importance such as honeybees (Apis mellifera L.). Thus, a particular attention should be paid to their protection, not only for their ecological importance by contributing to the maintenance of wild plant diversity, but also for their economic value as honey producers and crop-pollinating agents. For all these reasons, the environmental protection requires the resort of risk assessment of pesticides. The goal of this work was therefore to develop a validated QSAR model to predict <b>contact</b> <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> (LD 50) of 111 pesticides to bees because the QSAR models devoted to this species are very scarce.

40|$|Tese de Doutoramento em Ciências - Especialidade em BiologiaThe {{development}} of biopesticides follows a strong rising trend {{over the last}} two decades, and a continued growth of the global biopesticides market is forecasted. This phenomenon is largely supported by the growing awareness to environmentally friendly food production and the introduction of restrictive regulations for pesticides. In light of their multiples advantage over synthetic pesticides, biopesticides appear economical, eco-friendly and less prone to the {{development of}} resistance, and hence are expected to provide more environmentally sustainable methods of biocontrol (Czaja et al., 2015). In fact, biopesticides have been integrated in several pest and vector management programs. As a complementary approach or alternative to synthetic pesticides, phytochemicals, namely essential oils (EOs) and volatile compounds are incorporated into crop protection products, as well as repellent formulations (Regnault- Roger et al., 2012). The best market opportunities have been assigned to EO-based pesticides, owing to the great availability, GRAS status, chemical simplicity, relatively low toxicity to vertebrates and specific mode-of-action of their constituents (Isman & Akhtar, 2007; Shaaya & Rafaeli, 2007). In this context, the Apiaceae (=Umbelliferae) family, which comprised economically important plants species, presents a wide variety of bioactive compounds being also an important source of EOs and volatile compounds distributed by several distinct chemicals classes. Aware of their traditional use, their relatively large worldwide production and the bioactive potential described by many authors, we proposed to perform an appraisal of the biopesticidal potential of well-known Apiaceae species, whose experimental approach, results and discussion are here reported. In a few words, this work consisted in: (1) the characterization of EOs extracted from different plant parts of four species [Anethum graveolens (dill), Cuminum cyminum (cumin), Foeniculum vulgare var. vulgare (bitter fennel), Petroselinum crispum (plain leaf parsley) ] and (2) the toxicological evaluation of some EOs and individual constituents, using as target organisms a mosquito (Anopheles atroparvus), a lepidopteran (Pseudaletia unipuncta) and a freshwater snail (Radix peregra). The anti-nematode properties of bitter fennel EOs and two phenylpropanoids against Meloidogyne javanica was also evaluated. EOs were isolated by hydrodistillation and chemically characterized by GC and GC-MS. Quantitative data were obtained using GC-FID and the identification of constituents was achieved with the help of spectra libraries and determination of their KI. The overall identification of their content ranged between 88 and 99. 5 %. The EOs content (ranging between 0. 10 - 3. 45 %) and chemical profiles were highly variable depending of the organ type, developmental stage and origin of the material. The development of dill umbels from the pre-flowering to the ripe fruit stage was accompanied by a significant increase of (S) - carvone (from 4 to 61 % of the EO content) and a reduction of α-phellandrene and dill ether contents. Bitter fennel infrutescences and leaves plus stems EOs were mainly composed by estragole (64 and 28 %, respectively), followed by α-phellandrene, α-pinene and fenchone. We also identified intra-individual variations in the cultivated population of bitter fennel. Concerning cumin EOs, all fruit samples and the commercial EO were mainly constituted by cuminaldehyde (28 - 39 %), followed by variable amounts of pmentha- 1, 4 -dien- 7 -al, p-mentha- 1, 3 -dien- 7 -al, β-pinene, p-cymene and γ-terpinene. EOs from parsley were the most complex of the four species, being characterized by a high percentage of hydrocarbon monoterpenes and several phenylpropenes (myristicin, apiole, elemicin and/or allyltetramethoxybenzene). The activity of EOs and individual compounds was assessed against A. atroparvus (3 rd instar larvae), P. unipuncta (eggs and larvae) and R. peregra (eggs, juveniles and adults). Bitter fennel EOs were also tested against eggs and juveniles of M. javanica. Whenever possible, mortality (%) was recorded for a range of optimized concentrations or at different times of exposure, and the lethal parameters for 50 % and 90 % (lethal concentrations, LCs, and/or lethal times, LTs) were estimated by Log-Probit analysis. EOs from parsley, cumin and bitter fennel (leaves more stems) were highly active towards the snail (both eggs and adults) and the mosquito larvae. Estimated LC 50 against adult snails varied from 13. 7 to 46. 5 mg L- 1 (48 h), and from 16 to 143 mg L- 1 (24 h) against the mosquito larvae, with parsley fruit EO being the most doseeffective one in both situations. A short-time exposure (8 h) to bitter fennel EOs was also effective for snail control. Regarding assays performed on P. unipuncta, dill, cumin and parsley EOs, as well as the compounds (S) -carvone, cuminaldehyde and myristicin, showed satisfactory egg hatching inhibition, and <b>acute</b> <b>contact</b> <b>toxicity</b> to the 4 th instar larvae (24 h-LC 50 ranging from 108 to 197 μg cm- 2). Dill, cumin and bitter fennel EOs and some of their constituents were effective by fumigation (≥ 80 %). In addition, the EO from parsley fruits, trans-anethole and cuminaldehyde displayed significant feeding deterrence and growth inhibition (FDI and GI > 70 %), when performing the no-choice assay with treated corn leaves, causing significant negative impact on the metabolism of this lepidopteran. Parsley fruits EO was of great efficacy against P. unipuncta, acting as ovicide, larvicide (by contact), feeding deterrent and growth inhibitor. Its constituents myristicin and apiole (purified by CC) showed similar effectiveness in several assays. Besides, we distinguish the phenylpropanoid trans-anethole (a constituent of bitter fennel EOs) for its acute insecticidal, nematicidal and molluscicidal activities, being more active than its isomer (estragole). The present study demonstrates that EOs from the four studied Apiaceae species, along with some of their major compounds, have moderate to strong anti-insect and molluscicidal properties. EOs and compounds showed distinct performances {{depending on the type of}} assay, the exposure period, the tested organism and/or its developmental stage. In general, the reproductive organs (umbels-bearing fruits and eventually ripen fruits) were optimum sources of EOs containing the highest percentage of biologically active compounds (except bitter fennel). As a whole, the results demonstrates that the four plant species are promising sources of botanical biopesticides in the context of the biochemical control of phytophagous insects and vectors of human and animal diseases. O desenvolvimento de biopesticidas tem progredido consistentemente ao longo das duas últimas décadas e as previsões apontam para uma tendência de crescimento contínuo do mercado global destes produtos. Este fenômeno é explicado essencialmente por uma maior consciencialização para a produção de alimentos de um modo sustentável e pela introdução de regulamentações mais restritivas ao uso de pesticidas. Em virtude das suas múltiplas vantagens relativamente aos pesticidas sintéticos, os biopesticidas afiguram-se económicos, ecológicos e menos propensos ao desenvolvimento de resistências constituindo, portanto, métodos de biocontrolo ambientalmente mais sustentáveis (Czaja et al, 2015). Com efeito, os biopesticidas têm sido integrados em vários programas de gestão de pragas e vetores. Como abordagem complementar ou alternativa aos pesticidas sintéticos, os fitoquímicos, nomeadamente óleos essenciais (OE) e seus constituintes voláteis, são incorporados em produtos de proteção das culturas bem como em formulações repelentes (Shaaya & Rafaeli, 2007; Regnault-Roger et al, 2012). Existe uma grande oportunidade de mercado para os pesticidas à base de OEs ou seus constituintes, em virtude da sua grande disponibilidade, da sua classificação GRAS, da simplicidade estrutural das moléculas, da relativa baixa toxicidade para os vertebrados e modos de ação específicos (Isman & Akhtar, 2007; Shaaya & Rafaeli, 2007). Neste contexto, a família Apiaceae (= Umbelliferae), que compreende espécies de plantas economicamente importantes, apresenta uma ampla variedade de compostos bioativos, sendo ainda uma importante fonte de OEs e compostos voláteis pertencentes a diversas classes químicas. Com fundamento nas suas utilizações tradicionais, na importante produção mundial e no potencial bioativo descrito por muitos autores, propusemos realizar uma avaliação do potencial biopesticida de espécies de Apiaceae bem conhecidas. Em resumo, este trabalho consistiu na: (1) caracterização dos OEs de diferentes partes de planta de quatro espécies [Anethum graveolens (aneto), Cuminum cyminum (cominho), Foeniculum vulgare var. vulgare (funcho amargo), Petroselinum crispum (salsa) ] e (2) na avaliação toxicológica de alguns OEs, bem como de alguns constituintes, usando uma espécie de mosquito (Anopheles atroparvus), um lepidóptero (Pseudaletia unipuncta) e um caracol de água doce (Radix peregra) como organismos alvo. As propriedades anti-nemátode dos OEs de funcho amargo e dois fenilpropanoides contra Meloidogyne javanica foram igualmente avaliadas. Os OEs foram isolados por hidrodestilação e caracterizados quimicamente por GC e GC-MS. Os dados quantitativos foram obtidos através de GC-FID sendo a identificação dos constituintes concretizada com base na consulta de bibliotecas espectrais e na determinação dos KI. A identificação abrangeu 88 a 99, 5 % do conteúdo total. Os teores em OE (compreendidos entre 0, 10 a 3, 45 % w/w) e os perfis químicos variaram consideravelmente em função do órgão, do estágio de desenvolvimento e da origem do material. O desenvolvimento de inflorescências de aneto desde a prefloração à maturação dos frutos foi acompanhado por um aumento significativo de (S) -carvona (de 4 a 61 % do teor dos OEs) e uma redução dos teores de α-felandreno e anetofurano. Por seu lado, os OEs de infrutescências e caules do funcho amargo eram maioritariamente constituídos por estragole (64 e 28 %, respetivamente), seguida de α-felandreno, α-pineno e fenchona. Também identificamos a ocorrência de variações intra-individuais na população cultivada de funcho amargo. Em relação aos OEs do cominho, todas as amostras de frutos e o OE comercial foram maioritariamente constituídos por cuminaldeído (28 - 39 %), e quantidades variáveis de p-menta- 1, 4 -dien- 7 -al, p-menta- 1, 3 -dien- 7 -al, β-pineno, pcimeno e γ-terpineno. De entre as quatro espécies os OEs de salsa foram os mais complexos, sendo caracterizados por uma elevada percentagem de hidrocarbonetos monoterpénicos e vários fenilpropenos (miristicina, apiole, elemicina e/ou alil-tetrametoxibenzeno). Posteriormente, foi investigada a atividade dos OEs e alguns compostos individuais sobre A. atroparvus (larvas de terceiro ínstar), P. unipuncta (ovos e larvas) e R. peregra (ovos, jovens e adultos). Os OEs do funcho amargo foram ainda testados contra ovos e jovens de M. javanica. Sempre que possível, a mortalidade (%) foi registrada para uma gama de concentrações otimizadas ou em diferentes tempos de exposição, sendo os parâmetros letais para 50 % e 90 % (concentrações letais, CLs e/ou tempos letais, TLs) estimadas por análise Log-Probit. Os OEs de salsa, cominho e funcho amargo (folhas e caules) foram extremamente ativos contra as formas embrionária e adulta do caracol, assim como nas larvas de mosquito. As CL 50 estimadas para os caracóis adultos variaram entre 13, 7 a 46, 5 mg L- 1 (48 h), e entre 16 a 143 mg L- 1 par as larvas do mosquito, sendo evidenciada a maior eficácia do OE de frutos de salsa na dose-resposta, contras ambos os organismos. A exposição de curta duração (8 h) aos OEs do funcho amargo foi também eficaz no controlo dos caracóis. Nos ensaios realizado com P. unipuncta, os OEs de aneto, cominho e salsa, bem como os compostos (S) -carvona, cuminaldeído e miristicina mostraram acentuados efeitos inibitórios na eclosão dos ovos, e uma aguda toxicidade por contacto sobre as larvas no quarto instar (as CL 50 às 24 h variaram entre 108 a 197 μg cm- 2). Os OEs de aneto, cominho e funcho e alguns dos seus constituintes foram eficazes por fumigação (≥ 80 %). Além disso, o OE de frutos de salsa, o trans-anetole e o cuminaldeído apresentaram efeitos inibitórios agudos no consumo de folhas de milho tratadas e no crescimento das larvas (FDI e GI> 70 %), revelando um impacto negativo no metabolismo deste lepidóptero muito significativo. O OE dos frutos da salsa foi de grande eficácia ovicida, larvicida, fago-repelente, e inibidor do crescimento larvar. Os constituintes miristicina e apiole, ambos purificados do OE de frutos de salsa por CC, mostraram eficácia similar em alguns ensaios. Além disso, distinguimos o phenylpropanoid trans-anetole (constituinte do OE de funcho) pela sua forte atividade inseticida, nematicida e moluscicidas, sendo mais ativo que o seu isómero (estragole). O presente estudo demonstra que os OEs das quatro espécies de Apiaceae, e alguns dos compostos testados, apresentam propriedades anti-inseto e moluscicidas moderadas a elevadas. Os OEs e compostos apresentaram desempenhos distintos, dependendo do tipo de ensaio, do período de exposição, do organismo testado e/ ou do seu estágio de desenvolvimento. Em geral, os órgãos reprodutivos destas plantas (infrutescências, eventualmente frutos maduros) foram ótimas fontes de OEs contendo percentagens superiores de compostos biologicamente ativos (exceto o funcho amargo). No seu todo, os resultados demonstram que as quatro espécies de plantas são promissoras fontes de biopesticidas botânicos no contexto do controlo bioquímico de insetos fitófagos e vetores transmissores de doenças em humanos e animais...|$|E

40|$|Background: Scaffold (biomaterial) {{biocompatibility}} test {{should be}} performed in vitro prior to in vivo stem cell application in animal or clinical trial. These test consists of direct and indirect toxicity test (MTT assay [3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide]). Those tests were used to identify cell morphological changes, cell-substrate adhesion impairment, and reduction in cell proliferation activity. Methods: The tested scaffolds were hydroxyapatite-calcium sulphate (HA-CaSO 4) (scaffold I), nano-particular HA paste (scaffold II), synthetic HA granule (scaffold III), bovine HA granule (scaffold IV), and morsellized bovine xenograft (scaffold V). Direct <b>contact</b> <b>toxicity</b> test and MTT assay [3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide] were performed on those groups. In direct <b>contact</b> <b>toxicity</b> test, we put granules of various scaffolds within plates and incubated together with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). In MTT assay we included phenol 20 mg/mL and 100 mg/mL group as positive control. Morphology, cell adhesion impairment, and cell growth were monitored daily until day- 7. Cells counting in the direct <b>contact</b> <b>toxicity</b> test was conducted on day- 7. Results: There were no changes on 24 hours observation after direct contact. On day- 7, an impairment of cell adhesion to plastic substrates, changes in cell morphology, and cell death were observed, especially in scaffold I, scaffold II, and scaffold V. In MTT assay, only scaffold I, phenol 20 mg/mL, and phenol 100 mg/mL showed more than 50 % inhibition at 24 -hour and 7 -day-observation. Extracts from scaffold II, III, IV, and V {{did not affect the}} viability and proliferation of bone marrow MSCs (inhibition value 0. 05).
