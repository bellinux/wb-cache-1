50|$|After dinner, Pete has a late {{meeting with}} Bethlehem Steel, {{during which he}} pitches his own <b>advertising</b> <b>idea,</b> without the {{knowledge}} of {{anyone else in the}} office. The next day, meeting with Bethlehem Steel in the office, Don is enraged when the client expresses great enthusiasm for, not Don's new idea, but, seemingly out of nowhere, Pete's unauthorized idea of the previous evening. Once Pete and Don are alone, Pete expects to be recognized for his brilliance and initiative. Instead, Don is livid, and Pete is annoyed because he feels he saved the day but Don got the praise for it. Pete is reading the situation completely wrong, however. It was grossly inappropriate for an Account man to go behind Creative's back to pitch an idea, {{while at the same time}} not supporting Creative's efforts. Don fires Pete, leading to Pete melting down and getting drunk in his office. Don and Roger meet with the company's senior partner, Bert Cooper, who tells them that they cannot fire Pete due to his family's connections with New York's hereditary wealthy elite - Pete is a Dykeman and his family owned everything in Manhattan above 125th Street at one time. Don and Roger go see Pete and Roger, putting on a show, angrily tells Pete that he was fired, that he and Bert wanted him fired, but Don fought for Pete to have a second chance and Pete owes Don a great debt. A grateful Pete obsequiously thanks Don. That night, Pete and Trudy begin moving into their new apartment. When a new neighbor says how impressed she is by all that Trudy has been telling her about Pete's Knickerbocker connections, Pete suspects the true reason for his remaining at Sterling Cooper, and wanders away to stare dejectedly out the window at the New York City skyline.|$|E
40|$|Both {{courses are}} core {{requirements}} for obtaining the Certified Marketing Research Professional (CMRP) designation through the Marketing Research and Intelligence Association (MRIA). This Canadian designation is well sought after by research practitioners in the marketing research, program evaluation and institutional analysis industry. The funding {{was used to}} claim expenses associated with course registrations and travel fees {{to and from the}} course venues. No papers were presented as this was not a conference. This report provides an overview of the topic areas covered in the two courses and their relevance to my role as an Institutional Analyst with the Office of Institutional Studies. 2. 0 	Marketing Research Design: An Applied Course The Marketing Research Design course examined key research designs used in marketing research and provided criteria for choosing the ideal research design based on specific research needs. It quickly covered the key theoretical concepts and then focused on case studies. The major topics covered in this core course were: 1. 	Understanding the need for marketing research 2. 	Defining the objectives of the research 3. 	Research Designs Exploratory, conclusive, and tracking research Cross-sectional and latitudinal design Secondary and primary research Tools of data collection 4. 	Selecting the research design and data collection tools 5. 	Elements of a research plan/proposal 6. 	Costing issues related to different research designs Course Relevance The course was fairly broad and introductory in scope which is in line with its positioning as a required core course. In a sense, it was a good confirmation and refresher of my existing knowledge and an eye opener to other research design areas that I have not utilized frequently in my career. Research design {{is an integral part of}} my role as an institutional analyst with the Office of Institutional Studies. We serve a wide client base across the university. As such, our clients’ research needs are many and varied, and each need requires a tailored research approach/design based on key objectives. For example, many of the program reviews we undertake have a qualitative component such as telephone, online or paper based surveys and qualitative component such as moderating focus groups or conducting key informant interviews. All of these research methods were discussed at length and case studies were presented to provide different real life scenarios which call for different research designs. Samples of data collection tools, such as sample surveys or focus group moderator’s guide, were also presented. The topic areas covering latitudinal design have implications for research on the effectiveness of advertising. For example, measuring awareness of Athabasca University among a population and then holding an advertising campaign after which the level of awareness is measured among the same population to identify advertising impact. The Office of Institutional Studies has been exploring such latitudinal approaches in measuring advertising effectiveness and this course was a valuable informer of best practices for this approach. 3. 0 	Qualitative Marketing Research The Qualitative Marketing Research course examined the theory and application of some of the most frequently used qualitative research techniques and it considered the key criteria used in selecting a qualitative research design. It provided an overview on budgeting for and using qualitative research for <b>advertising,</b> <b>idea</b> generation, product development and customer/employee satisfaction. The major topics covered in this core course were: 1. 	Focus groups, dyads, triads and in-depth interviews 2. 	Developing discussion guides 3. 	Using and selecting the best research design 4. 	Costing qualitative research 5. 	Making the right demands of recruiters 6. 	Listening and observing for maximum benefit 7. 	Translating qualitative research into actionable reports 8. 	New and innovative moderating and projective techniques Course Relevance As an Instititutional Analyst with the Office of Institutional Studies I planned three usability testing focus group sessions at Athabasca University Central, the Edmonton Learning Centre, and the Calgary Learning Centre. The purpose of the sessions was to solicit staff feedback on a new staff portal to be modeled after the myAU portal for students. As such, I designed the sample distribution of participants in the three geographies based on job titles, designed recruitment screeners to invite focus group participants and supervised the recruitment activities undertaken at the Office of Institutional Studies. I also designed the focus group moderator’s guide and facilitated the focus group discussions. In light of future focus groups which are anticipated to be undertaken by our office, my attendance at the Qualitative Marketing Research course was extremely relevant. The course explored various focus group setups such as one on one interviews, dyads (holding a focus group with two participants), and triads (holding a focus group with three participants). Holding a series of triads as opposed to a single big focus group was recommended for future usability testing to allow for more depth in engaging with participants, an approach that could be adopted at a future focus group being planned at the Centre for Innovative Management. The course also explored projective techniques such as “personification” to engage participants who have difficulty in describing a product or a service. For example, a participant could be asked: “If this product was a person, what type of a person would it be?” The cited attributes for the person would then be projected back onto the product. This technique could have wide applications at Athabasca University to open up respondents who are either introverted or have difficulty expressing their views on certain products or services under evaluation. There was also a discussion on recruitment screeners. Various examples were cited based on various combinations of demographics and psychographics depending on research design, again an eye opener to future focus group recruitments at Athabasca University. All in all, this course was very relevant to my position and equipped me with new knowledge that could be applied to future qualitative research projects designed and managed by the Office of Institutional Studies. I will be a student among others who will be taking courses through MRIAś School of Marketing Research to obtain my CMRP designation. So far I have completed two courses and would like to receive funding to take two more. The Office of Institutional Studies where I work indicated that they might provide me with 300 to support my studies. I am requesting the maximum of 1500 from the Academic and Professional Development Fund because I intend to take more courses with my 2000 PD money. I will be basically attending two courses. No papers are required for presentation. The courses required for the CMRP designation would benefit Athabasca Universityś Office of Institutional Studies as the courses would provide me with formal education in market research (qualitative and quantitative) techniques as well as program evaluation approaches. Our Office undertakes numerous related studies such as Graduate Outcome Surveys, various Program Reviews, Staff Climate Surveys, Moderation of Focus Groups and many other studies. In my capacity as an Institutional Analyst, my formal training for a CMRP would enhance my abilities to apply current and up-to-date techniques to Athabasca Universityś research and program review projects. This is essentially a professional development activity that adds value to my knowledge and abilities which in turn would benefit Athabasca University over the course of my employment.

50|$|As an {{advertising}} executive with the Disney company for 38 years, Jack Lindquist pioneered {{advertising and marketing}} promotions that were successfully replicated industry-wide. In many ways, the Disneyland park was the test bed and incubator {{for the establishment of}} marketing techniques for the increasingly popular concept of modern amusement park, the Theme Park. Thus, many of the advertising, marketing and public relations techniques used by many in today's outdoor entertainment industry are based on the examples that Lindquist pioneered through the Disneyland experiences and experiments. Likewise, some of the marketing and <b>advertising</b> <b>ideas</b> that were pioneered in the Disneyland park were also applied outside the amusement park field and into the modern day marketing and sales of modern-day live performances and events.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} mass {{collaboration}} {{has led to}} a number of efforts to harness and commercialize shared tasks. Collectively known as crowdsourcing, these ventures typically involve on an online system of accounts for coordinating buyers and sellers of labor.

In the advertising industry, Giant Hydra employs mass collaboration to enable creatives to collaborate on <b>advertising</b> <b>ideas</b> online and create what they call an 'idea matrix', a highly complex node of concepts, executions and ideas all connected to each other. In the financial industry, companies such as the Open Models Valuation Company (OMVCO) also employ mass collaboration to improve the accuracy of financial forecasts.|$|R

The camera frequently pans from the shoes to their breasts and faces, and closed captioning reading [...] "sexual breathing". Seeing the chief marketing director's bored reaction, the designers begin to incorporate more graphic ideas into the advertisement, including the joggers headbutting various bystanders to death and engaging in a lesbian kiss, to {{the approval of the}} director and his executives, who toast champagne to celebrate their success.|$|R

40|$|We {{question}} whether creativity requires functions exclusive {{to the human}} mind or it can rather be obtained by the mere performance of well-defined prescribed operations. The natural thinking process involves a complexity of sensory inputs, psychological factors, cognitive background, social rules and constraints which interfere (constructively and at times, destructively) with the results and evaluation of the creative process. It is therefore desirable to study the intrinsic properties of the creative thought dynamics in contexts in which creativity represents a dominant factor. Among the domains in which creativity plays an essential role is advertising. By structural analysis of a large mass of past <b>advertising</b> <b>ideas</b> we isolated a set of conceptual structures which characterize generically creative ideas. In order to validate these findings, we constructed idea-generating routines that lead to these conceptual structures. To ensure that human creativity does {{not interfere with the}} performance of those routines, we implemented them by computer. The computer-generated ideas ranked significantly higher on a creativity scale than the ideas produced by the human subjects. In {{view of the fact that}} the computerized routine is not performing any complex creation, the focal question raised is why do human judges perceive its outcomes as superior to human ideas performing the same task?...|$|R
