500|$|The popular {{periodic}} table layout, {{also known as}} the common or standard form (as shown at various other points in this article), is attributable to Horace Groves Deming. In 1923, Deming, an American chemist, published short (...) and medium (...) form {{periodic table}}s. Merck and Company prepared <b>a</b> <b>handout</b> form of Deming's 18-column medium table, in 1928, which was widely circulated in American schools.

2500|$|References to a {{dividing}} line between metals and nonmetals appear in the literature {{as far back as}} at least 1869. In 1891, Walker published a periodic 'tabulation' with a diagonal straight line drawn between the metals and the nonmetals. In 1906, Alexander Smith published a periodic table with a zigzag line separating the nonmetals from the rest of elements, in his highly influential textbook Introduction to General Inorganic Chemistry. In 1923, Horace G. Deming, an American chemist, published short (...) and medium (...) form periodic tables. Each one had a regular stepped line separating metals from nonmetals. Merck and Company prepared <b>a</b> <b>handout</b> form of Deming's 18-column table, in 1928, which was widely circulated in American schools.

[...] At the time welfare caseloads climbed 36 percent from 1988 while one out of twelve Virginians were receiving food stamps. [...] In March 1995, after an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of support, Allen signed his welfare reform bill propelling Virginia ahead of the national welfare reform effort, [...] Among the key provisions outlined in the bill, the Virginia Initiative for Employment Not Welfare (VIEW) limited Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) benefits for welfare recipients to two years while recipients are required to work within ninety days of receiving benefits. [...] Following VIEW's implementation, welfare caseloads decreased 33 percent, from 73,926 families in March 1995 to 49,609 families in July 1997. [...] In areas where VIEW existed for twelve months, 74 percent were employed versus only 31 percent nationally,. [...] According to the Virginia Department of Health and Human Resource's 1996 annual report, VIEW saved taxpayers 24 million dollar in its first year of existence; with an addition to federal welfare money, the savings total over the following two years comes to just over $70million ...|$|E

5000|$|Handouts {{can also}} display charts, graphs, pictures, or illustrations. An {{important}} aspect of the use of <b>a</b> <b>handout</b> is that a person can keep <b>a</b> <b>handout</b> with them long after the presentation is over. This can help the person better remember what was discussed. Passing out handouts, however, can be extremely distracting. Once <b>a</b> <b>handout</b> is given out, it might potentially be difficult to bring back your audience’s attention. The person who receives the handout might be tempted to read what is on the paper, which will keep them from listening to what the speaker is saying. If using <b>a</b> <b>handout,</b> the speaker distributes the hand out right before you reference it. [...] Distributing handouts is acceptable in a lecture that is an hour or two, but in a short lecture of five to ten minutes, <b>a</b> <b>handout</b> should not be used.|$|E
