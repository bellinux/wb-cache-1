40|$|A quartz {{tuning fork}} filter circuit and some unique CMOS clock logic methods provide {{a very simple}} OMEGA-VLF {{receiver}} with true hyperbolic station pair phase difference outputs. An experimental system was implemented on a single battery-operated circuit board requiring only an external <b>antenna</b> <b>preamplifier,</b> and LOP output recorder. A bench evaluation and preliminary navigation tests indicate the technique is viable and can provide very low-cost OMEGA measurement systems. The method is promising for marine use with small boats in the present form, but might be implemented in conjunction with digital microprocessors for airborne navigation aids...|$|E
40|$|This master’s thesis {{introduces}} to {{the reader}} with a modern antenna type the microstrip patch antennas. The most common types of microstrip antennas and their parameters and feeding methods are introduced in the theoretical section of this master’s thesis. This section deals with the circularly polarized microstrip antennas. Design of an active dual-band circularly polarized antenna for global navigation satellite application in the AWR Microwave Office {{is presented in the}} practical section. The proposed single-fed dual-band circularly polarized design is achieved using two stacked square microstrip patches. The antenna operates at the L 1 + E 1 and L 5 + E 5 a frequency bands. <b>Antenna</b> <b>preamplifier</b> consists of a low-noise transistor and a dual-band band-pass filter. The thesis describes realization and measurement results of the dual-band antenna performance in the anechoic chamber. Measured results of the preamplifier performance are presented...|$|E
40|$|Although {{practically}} all function {{blocks of the}} satellite navigation receivers are realized using the CMOS digital integrated circuits, {{it is appropriate to}} create a separate low noise <b>antenna</b> <b>preamplifier</b> based on a low noise pHEMT. Such an RF front end can be strongly optimized to attain a suitable tradeoff between the noise figure and transducer power gain. Further, as all the four principal navigation systems (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and COMPASS) work in similar frequency bands (roughly from 1. 1 to 1. 7 GHz), it is reasonable to create the low noise preamplifier for all of them. In the paper, a sophisticated method of the amplifier design is suggested based on multiobjective optimization. A substantial improvement of a standard optimization method is also outlined to satisfy a uniform coverage of Pareto front. Moreover, for enhancing efficiency of many times repeated solutions of large linear systems during the optimization, a new modification of the Markowitz criterion is suggested compatible with fast modes of the LU factorization. Extraordinary attention was also given to the accuracy of modeling. First, an extraction of pHEMT model parameters was performed including its noise part, and several models were compared. The extraction was carried out by an original identification procedure based on a combination of metaheuristic and direct methods. Second, the equations of the passive elements (including transmission lines and T-splitters) were carefully defined using frequency dispersion of their parameters as Q, ESR, etc. Third, an optimal selection of the operating point and essential passive elements was performed using the improved optimization method. Finally, the s-parameters and noise figure of the amplifier were measured, and stability and third-order intermodulation products were also checked...|$|E

The output of the study includes design curves and tables which indicate the best choice of <b>antenna</b> size and <b>preamplifier</b> type to provide a given G/T performance.

50|$|Tunable <b>antenna</b> <b>preamplifiers</b> (preamps) often {{incorporate}} a front-end preselector circuit {{to improve their}} performance. The integrated device is both a preamplifier and a preselector, and either name is correct. This ambiguity sometimes leads to confusion. A passive preselector has no power and no internal amplifier, and typically works quite well with modern receivers, with negligible signal-loss. Further, receivers and preamps get no benefit from a preselector if they are fed from a narrow-band source, such as a small loop antenna.|$|R
25|$|Man-made EMI (electromagnetic interference) {{can also}} disrupt or jam GPS signals. In one {{well-documented}} {{case it was}} impossible to receive GPS signals in the entire harbor of Moss Landing, California due to unintentional jamming caused by malfunctioning TV <b>antenna</b> <b>preamplifiers.</b> Intentional jamming is also possible. Generally, stronger signals can interfere with GPS receivers when they are within radio range or line of sight. In 2002 a detailed description of how to build a short-range GPS L1 C/A jammer was published in the online magazine Phrack.|$|R

40|$|The {{limitations}} of different E-field <b>antenna</b> coupler or <b>preamplifier</b> circuits are presented. All circuits were evaluated using actual Loran or Omega signals. Electric field whip or wire antennas are the simplest types {{which can be}} used for reception of VLF signals in the 10 to 100 kHz range. JFET or MOSFET transistors provide impedance transformation and some voltage gain in simple circuits where the power for operating the preamplifier uses the same coaxial cable that feeds the signal back to the receiver. The circuit techniques provide useful alternative methods for Loran-Omega receiver system designers...|$|R
40|$|A {{preamplifier}} is an amplifier {{used in a}} way {{such that}} it usually precedes another amplifier to prepare an electronic signal for further amplification or processing. It is usually a low noise amplifier with moderate gain. For example, in communications systems, the preamplifier is used to amplify the very small signals received by the antenna and is often located {{very close to the}} <b>antenna.</b> Using a <b>preamplifier</b> with low noise, the noise of all the subsequent stages is reduced by the gain of the preamplifier and the noise of the preamplifier is injected directly into the received signal. A preamplifier is required to boost the desired signal power while adding as little noise and distortion as possible so that the retrieval of this signal is possible in the later stages in the system. The following sections will give a description of noise and the effect an amplifier has on the sensitivity and noise figure of a system as well as a method for choosing the correct amplifier to meet your measurement needs...|$|R
40|$|The {{means by}} which the data {{collected}} by the Voyager 1 mission to Jupiter were returned to earth are presented. Radio links between the earth and the spacecraft are used for the transmission of both imaging and nonimaging telemetry from the spacecraft and commands from the earth and for radiometric observations of the spacecraft and its environment. Features which have lead to vast improvements in the capability of the Voyager telecommunications system over that of previous space probes include the use of X-band rather than S-band telemetry, a dual power X-band traveling wave tube amplifier, a 3. 7 m spacecraft antenna and a single channel telemetry system with concatenated coding. Communications equipment at the three ground complexes of the Deep Space Network for telemetry reception includes 64 m steerable <b>antennas,</b> cryogenic maser <b>preamplifiers</b> and a phase-lock loop receiver. Voyager 1 has met or exceeded all of its telecommunications requirements, providing a 98 % data return and a total of 2 x 10 to the 11 th data bits during the Jupiter encounter...|$|R
30|$|Our ELF-VLF {{receiver}} {{consists of}} a magnetic <b>antenna,</b> a <b>preamplifier,</b> an ADC (Analog to Digital Converter), a SU (Service Unit), a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, a PC, and recording software. The details of this receiver are described in our previous work (Tan et al. 2014). It has been developed to record the atmospheric signals. The antenna includes two orthogonal loops which are right isosceles triangles with the base of 2.6 m. Each loop consists of 8 turns of 18 American Wire Gause copper wire. The surface of one loop orients in the north-south (N-S) direction, while the surface of other loop orients in the east-west (E-W) direction. If the magnetic component of electromagnetic waves changes and passes the loop of antennas, a voltage will be generated in the coils of the antenna (Ramo et al. 1994). In order to minimize signal interference, the loops are wrapped with the silver shields. The plane of the antenna which is perpendicular to E-W is chosen because it is very sensitive to sferics generated by lightning discharges (Dahlgren et al. 2011; Wood 2004). The signals from antenna are amplified and filtered by a <b>preamplifier</b> near the <b>antenna</b> and then transmitted by the coaxial cable to the ADC {{at a distance of}} 150 m. The preamplifier is powered by a particular DC power supply to remove the AC noise. The ELF-VLF signals from the E-W channel of the preamplifier go into the sound card. The SpectrumLab v 2.77 b 22 records the sferics with audio files having extension “wav.” The GPS is utilized for time synchronization with an accuracy of 100 ns. To record the sferics, SpectrumLab is configured with the sample rate of 44.1 kHz, 16 -bit sampling, and fast Fourier transform (FFT) input size of 512. The Sonic visualiser software developed by Cannam et al. (2010) is used to analyze the audio files.|$|R
40|$|International audienceNenuFAR {{is both a}} giant {{extension}} of the LOFAR and a large standalone instrument in the low-frequency range (10 - 85 MHz). It was designed in Nançay with national and international collaboration. Antenna radiators were modeled on the LWA <b>antenna</b> design whereas <b>preamplifiers</b> were designed in France. Antennas will be distributed in 96 mini-arrays of 19 dual-polarized elements, densely covering a disk of 400 m in diameter. A few mini-arrays are expected to lie at distances of 2 - 3 km. A silent control-command system was designed, and the computer dialog with LOFAR defined. Receivers will include the LOFAR backend, a local beamformer and a local correlator. NenuFAR is in construction in Nançay and it was recently granted by the SKA office the official label of SKA pathfinder. Its exploitation will expand the scope of LOFAR scientific studies as well as permit new studies, preparing for SKA science. The NenuFAR concept has many points in common with GURT (the Giant Ukrainian Radio Telescope), with which it shares some technical studies, an its exploitation will benefit from a coordination with UTR- 2.
