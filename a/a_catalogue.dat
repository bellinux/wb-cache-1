5|$|His {{antiquarian}} interests {{also included}} armour. In 1834 he published <b>A</b> <b>Catalogue</b> of the Collection of Ancient Arms and Armour, {{the property of}} Bernard Brocas, with a prefatory notice. In 1857 Planché was invited to arrange the collection of armour formerly belonging to his friend Sir Samuel Meyrick for the Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester, a task which he repeated in South Kensington in 1868. Concerned {{by the state of}} the armour in the Tower of London, Planché wrote several reports on the subject between 1855 and 1869. In that year, the War Office invited him to rearrange the collection in chronological order, {{which was one of the}} things for which he had been campaigning.|$|E

5|$|In November 1968, Grant {{secured a}} $143,000 advance {{contract}} from Atlantic Records, {{which was then}} the biggest deal of its kind for a new band. Atlantic were a label with <b>a</b> <b>catalogue</b> of mainly blues, soul, and jazz artists, but in the late 1960s they began to {{take an interest in}} British progressive rock acts. Record executives signed Led Zeppelin without having ever seen them. Under the terms of their contract, the band had autonomy in deciding when they would release albums and tour, and had the final say over the contents and design of each album. They would also decide how to promote each release and which tracks to release as singles. They formed their own company, Superhype, to handle all publishing rights.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{began work}} on Macbeth to provide a sample of what he thought could be {{achieved}} in a new edition of Shakespeare. He got much of his information while working on the Harleian Catalogue, <b>a</b> <b>catalogue</b> of the collection of works and pamphlets owned by Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer. He published this work, along with a commentary on Sir Thomas Hanmer, 4th Baronet's edition of Shakespeare's plays, as Miscellaneous Observations or Miscellaneous Observations on the Tragedy of Macbeth on 6 April 1745 by Edward Cave.|$|E
5|$|The Lingbao School {{began in}} around 400 CE when the Lingbao scriptures were {{revealed}} to Ge Chaofu, the grandnephew of Ge Hong. Ge Chaofu {{claimed that the}} scriptures came {{to him in a}} line of transmission going back to Ge Hong's great-uncle, Ge Xuan (164-244). Ge Chaofu transmitted the scriptures to two of his disciples, and the scriptures quickly gained immense popularity. In 471, Lu Xiujing (406-477) compiled <b>a</b> <b>catalogue</b> of all the Lingbao texts, and also was responsible for reorganizing and standardizing Lingbao ritual. This organization of texts and ritual provided a solid foundation on which the Lingbao School prospered in the subsequent centuries. During the Tang Dynasty, the influence of the Lingbao School declined and another school of Daoism, the Shangqing School, became prominent. Borrowing many Lingbao practices, it was well accepted by the aristocracy and established an influence in court.|$|E

In 1946 she began working as <b>a</b> <b>cataloguer</b> and reviser for the Library of Congress music section.

5|$|The {{primary source}} of the list below is taken from the Volcanoes of the World book, {{compiled}} by two volcanologists Tom Simkin and Lee Siebert, in which active volcanoes in the past 10,000years (Holocene) are listed. Particularly for Indonesia, Simkin and Siebert used <b>a</b> <b>catalogue</b> of active volcanoes from the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior publication series. The Simkin and Siebert list is the most complete list of volcanoes in Indonesia, but {{the accuracy of the}} record varies from one region to another in terms of contemporary activities and fatalities in recent eruptions. Complementary sources for the latest volcanic data are taken from the Volcanological Survey of Indonesia, a governmental institution which is responsible for volcanic activities and geological hazard mitigation in Indonesia, and some academic resources.|$|E
5|$|Either {{side of the}} Marble Hall, lie the Great Staircase (2) and the Tapestry Room (11), which {{contains}} a collection of early eighteenth century Mortlake tapestries. The Great Staircase {{to the east of}} the Marble Hall is unusually placed at Belton, as in a house of this period one would expect to find the staircase in the hall. The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall. Thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house. The Great Dining Room, now the Library, has been greatly altered and all traces of Carolean decoration removed, first by James Wyatt in 1778 when it was transformed into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling, and again in 1876, when its use was again changed, this time to a library. The room contains some 6000 volumes, a superb example of book collecting over 350 years. When Lord Tyrconnel died in 1754 <b>a</b> <b>catalogue</b> of his library identified almost 2,300 books. Almost all of these remain in the Belton library today. Rupert Gunnis attributed the carved marble chimneypiece depicting two Roman goddesses to Sir Richard Westmacott.|$|E
5|$|Frederic G. Kenyon {{opposed to}} the Burkit's view and argued that Cyril firmly {{believed}} in the Egyptian origin of the codex. A. S. Fulton, the Keeper of the Department of Oriental Printed Books and Manuscripts (in British Museum), in 1938 re-examined the Athanasius note, and gave it as his opinion that on palaeographical grounds it could be dated 13th to 14th century and that the 17th century was excluded. In 1945 T. D. Moschonas published <b>a</b> <b>catalogue</b> of the library of the Patriarch of Alexandria, in which he printed two Greek notes, both from 10th-century manuscripts of John Chrysostom, inserted by the Patriarch Athanasius III. The two notes must have been written between 1308 and 1316. Although the note in the Codex Alexandrinus is entirely in Arabic, and therefore no identity of hand the Greek notes can be expected, the similarity of wording leaves no doubt that this also {{is the work of}} Athanasius III.|$|E

She went on to UCSD from 1969 to 1971 as art, {{literature}} and language bibliographer and to the Brand Library in Glendale, CA as Director from 1971 to 1973.

5|$|Italian {{navigator}} Amerigo Vespucci {{explored the}} New World {{at the beginning}} of the 16th century. He learnt to recognize the stars in the southern hemisphere and made <b>a</b> <b>catalogue</b> for his patron king Manuel I of Portugal, which is now lost. As well as the catalogue, Vespucci wrote descriptions of the southern stars, including a triangle which may be either Triangulum Australe or Apus. This was sent to his patron in Florence, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, and published as Mundus Novus in 1504. The first depiction of the constellation was provided in 1589 by Flemish astronomer and clergyman Petrus Plancius on a -cm diameter celestial globe published in Amsterdam by Dutch cartographer Jacob Floris van Langren, where it was called Triangulus Antarcticus and incorrectly portrayed to the south of Argo Navis. His student Petrus Keyzer, along with Dutch explorer Frederick de Houtman, coined the name Den Zuyden Trianghel. Triangulum Australe was more accurately depicted in Johann Bayer's celestial atlas Uranometria in 1603, where it was also given its current name.|$|E
5|$|Parlett {{included}} an extensive discography in his 1999 <b>A</b> <b>Catalogue</b> of the Works of Sir Arnold Bax, later expanded and updated in a website. At 2015 the latter lists more than 250 works by Bax {{that have been}} recorded and published. The discography includes three complete cycles of Bax's symphonies released on CD, two by Chandos Records, the first conducted by Bryden Thomson (recorded 1983–88) and the second by Handley (2003); between them was a cycle issued by Naxos Records conducted by David Lloyd-Jones (recorded 1997–2001). The major tone poems and other orchestral works have been recorded, {{many of them in}} several different versions. Bax's chamber music is well represented on disc, with recordings of most of the works, and multiple versions of many, including the Elegiac Trio, the Clarinet Sonata and the Fantasy Sonata. Much of the piano music has been recorded by pianists including Iris Loveridge, John McCabe, Ashley Wass and Michael Endres, though by 2015 no integral survey had yet been recorded. Of the vocal works, by far the most often recorded is Mater ora Filium, but other choral works, and a representative selection of the songs are on disc.|$|E
