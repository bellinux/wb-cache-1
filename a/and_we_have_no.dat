5|$|The {{only reason}} the Nazis put on {{prisoner}} broadcasts {{is to get}} people justifiably anxious about relatives reported missing at the front {{to listen to their}} propaganda. Although many of the messages undoubtedly are true, they represent but a small fraction of our prisoners <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> assurance that many of them are not faked from papers picked up on the battlefield. What concerns some of us is the consequences of listening to Nazi broadcasts unless you are a well-trained listener (and often, even if you are). Nazi arguments often sound plausible. A person may listen to them with all the skepticism in the world, knowing that every word is a lie. But if the content is sufficiently sensational (and it often is) the source may be forgotten in time, and out pops the Nazi lie, all unsuspecting.|$|E

This work is lost, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> direct knowledge of any fragment of it. In the 3rd codification, however, many provisions have been taken from the 2nd, and these are designated by the word antiqua; by means of these antiqua we are enabled in a certain measure to reconstruct the work of Leovigild.|$|E

In a letter to the British Ambassador on 10 September 1956, Sir Ivone Kirkpatrick, the Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office wrote: If we sit back while Nasser consolidates his position and gradually acquires control of the oil-bearing countries, he can and is, according to our information, resolved to wreck us. If Middle Eastern oil is denied to us for a year or two, our gold reserves will disappear. If our gold reserves disappear, the sterling area disintegrates. If the sterling area disintegrates <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> reserves, we shall not be able to maintain a force in Germany, or indeed, anywhere else.

The report {{was made by the}} San Diego County Sheriff's Department, leaving the future of the band uncertain. On the following day, the band released a statement in which they said: [...] "The legal process is taking its course <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> more information than you do. There are many unanswered questions, and the situation will become clearer in the coming days and weeks. We'll keep you informed as best we can."

[...] Eight days later, the band cancelled their mid-2013 tour with Killswitch Engage, stating that [...] "we feel that it is best for the band to be off the road while the current situation gets sorted". During the month of his initial arrest, Lambesis pleaded [...] "not guilty" [...] and his lawyer stated: [...] "His thought processes were devastatingly affected by his steroid use."

500|$|To {{help fund}} the future works, the church {{announced}} plans in January 2008 to sell [...] of undeveloped, wooded property it owns on Hampton Lane to Shelter Development Corp. {{for construction of}} a senior citizen housing complex. A zoning change application was submitted to Baltimore County officials to allow sixteen residential units per acre (current zoning limits density to two residential units per acre) {{for a total of}} 80100beds. The Hampton Improvement Association, representing neighboring Hampton, Maryland residents, said they [...] "...oppose zoning changes that would allow higher density residential development and require trees to be knocked down". Then-pastor David Cooney told the Baltimore Sun, [...] "We entered into this with Shelter, believing this is a good use for the land [...] that this is a good company and a needed service". In the face of community objections, however, Shelter and the church subsequently announced on March 3, 2008, that the development plans had been dropped. A Shelter official said that his company and Towson United Methodist Church had jointly {{come to the conclusion that}} [...] "this is not something we are going to pursue". Pastor Cooney said, [...] "It had become clear that we weren't going to be able to reach a compromise and we certainly don't want to be at war with our neighbors". In the wake of the plan's shelving, the president of the Hampton Improvement Association told the Towson Times that his group wishes to work with Towson United Methodist Church to find an alternative use for the land besides commercial development, as they [...] "don't want to preclude the church from trying to get some money out of it." [...] In April 2008, Dr. Cooney said that the church [...] "did not set out to sell this land; the proposal came to us, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> other plans to sell or develop the land".|$|E
