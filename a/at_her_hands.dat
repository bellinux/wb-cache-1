5|$|Following {{the battle}} of Char, in , Raynor and Kerrigan are taken to a secret lab by Valerian to {{evaluate}} the extension of Kerrigan's current power to control the Zergs, until it is attacked by Dominion forces. Raynor is captured by Nova and Mengsk declares that he was executed, much to Kerrigan's grief. However, Mengsk later contacts Kerrigan and reveals that Raynor is still alive and under his custody, using him as a leverage to have her keep the Zerg swarm, now reunited under her command, away from Dominion Territory. Kerrigan then manages to rescue Raynor with the Raiders' help and despite his rejection of Kerrigan at first for choosing to abandon her humanity {{in order to save}} him, he and his forces join the swarm for a final battle on Korhal to overthrow Mengsk, saving Kerrigan once more when the Emperor tries to destroy her with the artifact, ultimately leading to Mengsk's death <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> Reconciled with Kerrigan, Raynor bids farewell to her as she leaves with the Zerg swarm to confront Amon, the fallen Xel'Naga which intends to return and exterminate both the Zerg and Protoss races.|$|E
2500|$|Later, Katniss, also injured, awakens from a coma {{to learn}} that the rebels have won, and Snow is {{awaiting}} execution <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> When she meets Snow by chance, he claims that it was Coin who secretly ordered the bombings in order to strip away the support of his remaining followers. Coin then asks the surviving victors to vote on a final Hunger Games, involving the children of high-ranking Capitol officials (including Snow's granddaughter). Katniss and Haymitch cast the deciding votes in favor of the scheme. However, at what is supposed to be Snow's execution, Katniss instead kills Coin with her bow. Snow laughs, then dies.|$|E
2500|$|On 25 November 1943, Inayat Khan {{escaped from}} the SD Headquarters, along with fellow SOE agents John Renshaw Starr and LÃ©on Faye, but was recaptured in the vicinity. There was an air raid alert as they escaped across the roof. Regulations {{required}} a count of prisoners at such times and their escape was discovered before they could get away. After refusing to sign a declaration renouncing future escape attempts, Inayat Khan was taken to Germany on 27 November 1943 [...] "for safe custody" [...] and imprisoned at Pforzheim in solitary confinement as a [...] "Nacht und Nebel" [...] ("Night and Fog": condemned to [...] "Disappearance without Trace") prisoner, in complete secrecy. For ten months, she was kept there, shackled <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and feet.|$|E

60|$|Helen {{sat down}} and looked mournfully <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> Well she might. Three suitors had kissed it, mounted their red roan steeds and ridden away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Kind nurse, gentlest, best of creatures," [...] he said, {{falling on}} his knee to <b>her,</b> and {{catching}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> [...] "forgive my cruel ingratitude!" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{was caught}} in a strange snare. She looked down <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{was turning}} {{one of her}} rings round, looking down <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> with downcast head.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] he said, [...] "you {{certainly}} could." [...] Then {{he glanced}} down <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> [...] "Those are unusually pretty gloves you have on." ...|$|E
60|$|Amy glanced <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> as she spoke, {{and stood}} staring as if struck dumb, for there on her {{forefinger}} shone a ring {{she had never}} seen before.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of what {{necessity}} should you? I {{have said}} it. That {{should be enough}} for a chivalrous American like you." [...] She again significantly looked down <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Olly {{looked down}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> Gabriel {{looked up at}} the roof. [...] "There's a leak thar that's got to be stopped to-morrow. Go to bed, Olly, or you'll take your death." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, have I lost my glove in there?" [...] said Mrs. March, looking <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> {{and such}} {{parts of her}} dress as a glove might cling to.|$|E
60|$|That {{was the one}} {{overwhelming}} {{thought in}} her, which annihilated all others. His love for her was dead, {{and he would not}} accept the great sacrifice <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E
6000|$|She got up, {{looked at}} him, looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> {{seemed about to}} speak, but did not. A little colour had come into her cheeks. Then, {{obviously}} making conversation, she asked: ...|$|E
60|$|The dog {{looked up}} and raising a paw scraped <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> until she opened it, when he thrust his chin into her palm. It was a trivial incident, but it somehow stirred the man.|$|R
60|$|He paused, {{and looked}} <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> <b>Her</b> <b>hands</b> were {{beginning}} to tremble in his.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>hand</b> {{was resting}} on the low pew next the high one of the De Stancys. Somerset looked at the hand, or rather at the glove which covered it, then <b>at</b> <b>her</b> averted cheek, then beyond it into the pew, then <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> again, until by an indescribable {{consciousness}} {{that he was not}} going too far he laid his own upon it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say {{your prayers}} {{and go to}} sleep," [...] she replied, {{and that was all}} the help Punch then or {{afterward}} found <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> in the new and delightful exercise of reading.|$|E
60|$|Instantly she summoned Murray to her {{presence}} {{with the message}} that she welcomed his return. Yet, despite that message, he hardly expected--considering what lay between them--the reception that awaited him <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E
60|$|Gwendolen was silent, again looking <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> She {{felt herself}} {{very far away}} from taking the resolve that would enforce acceptance; and after waiting an instant or two, Klesmer went on with deepened seriousness.|$|E
6000|$|Gyp, uneasy and astonished, stared <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> still {{tingling}} {{from the}} pressure of his bristly moustache. Then she laughed again--it was just [...] "foreign" [...] to have your hand kissed--and {{went back to her}} book, without taking in the words.|$|R
60|$|She {{pulled down}} her veil suddenly. He caught <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> It lay passively in his. He pleaded for her confidence, {{but the moment}} of {{inspiration}} had gone. She heard him with the air of one who listens no longer. Presently she stopped him.|$|R
60|$|He {{kissed her}} passionately. She yielded to his embrace, but almost {{immediately}} drew herself away. He clutched <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> but she eluded him. With swift footsteps {{she crossed the}} lawn. Just as she reached the terrace, the windows opened once more and some one called her name.|$|R
60|$|Juanna {{heard and}} from that moment {{made up her mind}} that {{whatever}} happened she had done with Soa. Nor was this wonderful, for few women could have pardoned what she had suffered <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E
60|$|Laura {{glanced down}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> and Nasmyth guessed {{what she was}} thinking, for they were hard, and work-roughened. The toil that her hands showed was, as he realized, {{only a part of}} her burden.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned his}} eyes aside, and looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> as she washed the forks. They trembled slightly. Then {{he looked back}} at her eyes again, that were {{watching}} him large and wistful and a little accusing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never," [...] he answered, passionately {{clasping}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> [...] "Call {{yourself by}} what name you will, I love you. If {{you are in}} trouble, let me help. Let {{me go back to}} the house with you, and we will face it together, whatever it may be. Come!" ...|$|R
60|$|Angela {{stood with}} her back to the fire, looking <b>at</b> him; <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> were locked behind her.|$|R
60|$|She was {{avoiding}} {{looking at}} him now. She looked instead <b>at</b> <b>her</b> clasped <b>hands.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "He couldn't seem to {{understand}} why I didn't say Yes the first time, if I meant it." [...] She looked down dreamily <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> in her lap, and then she said, with a blush and a start, [...] "They're very queer, don't you think?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He caught <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> {{and looked}} upon her with face grown older and graver as he bitterly wailed: [...] "Why couldn't {{we have met}} before you went to him? You must not go with him now, for you are mine at heart, you belong to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Klesmer had {{delivered}} himself with emphatic rapidity, and now paused a moment. Gwendolen was motionless, looking <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> which lay {{over each other}} on her lap, till the deep-toned, long-drawn [...] "But," [...] with which he resumed, had a startling effect, and made her look at him again.|$|E
5000|$|After Manang leaves, Cathy tells Mari what Manang said to {{her that}} no one stays much longer there. Cathy dreams of Dr. Corpuz killing Consuelo (Isabel Granada). Cathy {{suddenly}} wakes up with a scream after Consuelo screams. Cathy cooks a tocino and egg, then {{she goes to the}} clinic, when she looks <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> have blood on them. Mari wakes up and gets the egg and tocino that was overcooked, he washes it and goes to the clinic. Cathy said that she has blood on her fingers, but when she looks her fingers, it no longer has blood on them ...|$|R
60|$|With rocking-chair in full action, {{suspended}} {{needle and}} thoughtful expression, Miss Yule had watched her sister {{for ten minutes}} as she sat with <b>her</b> work <b>at</b> <b>her</b> feet, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> folded on <b>her</b> lap, and her eyes dreamily fixed on vacancy.|$|R
50|$|Dr. Phineas Phoenix: A {{scientist}} who deals in reanimating the dead, and creating clones. His {{goal is to}} take a criminal and reform him into a productive member of society. As a result, several of Black Scorpion's enemies return from fatal defeats <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> (Breathtaker, Inferno and Gangster Prankster). He is played by Raye Birk.|$|R
