25|$|The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is a Monte Carlo {{implementation}} of the Bayesian update problem: given a probability density function (pdf) {{of the state of}} the modeled system (the prior, called often the forecast in geosciences) and the data likelihood, the Bayes theorem is used to obtain the pdf after the data likelihood has been taken into account (the posterior, often called the analysis). This is called a Bayesian update. The Bayesian update is combined with advancing the model in time, incorporating new data from time to time. The original Kalman Filter assumes that all pdfs are Gaussian (the Gaussian assumption) and provides algebraic formulas for the change of the mean and the covariance matrix by the Bayesian update, as well as a formula for advancing the covariance matrix in time provided the system is linear. However, maintaining the covariance matrix is not feasible computationally for high-dimensional systems. For this reason, EnKFs were developed. EnKFs represent the distribution of the system state using a collection of state vectors, called an ensemble, and replace the covariance matrix by the sample covariance computed from the ensemble. The ensemble is operated with as if it were a random sample, but the ensemble members <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>not</b> independent – the EnKF ties them together. One advantage of EnKFs is that advancing the pdf in time is achieved by simply advancing each member of the ensemble. For a survey of EnKF and related data assimilation techniques, see G. Evensen.|$|E
500|$|Fox Mulder and Dana Scully's {{fight in}} the episode where Scully gets upset due to Mulder always driving grew out of nitpicking from fans {{about the fact that}} Mulder always seems to be the one driving the car. Mulder's joke about Scully's [...] "little feet" [...] was a joke that Carter had made before at an X-Files {{convention}} in Pasadena, California. Gillian Anderson stated that these have been things that fans on the internet have been nitpicking about {{since the beginning of the}} show. David Duchovny later explained that the comedic episodes of the series were often more ludicrous than the other episodes in the show. He noted, [...] "There's The X-Files of the stand-alone, and then there's The X-Files of the mythology, and then there are the comedic X-Files as well, in which the characters <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>not</b> quite the characters that we know." ...|$|E
500|$|The Oregonian ran a 20-part {{series on}} Rajneesh's movement, {{beginning}} in June 1985, which included {{an investigation into}} the Salmonella incident. As a result of a follow-up investigation, The Oregonian learned that Leslie L. Zaitz, one of their investigative journalists, had been placed as number three on a top-ten hit list by Sheela's group. Then-Oregon Attorney General Dave Frohnmayer commented on the poisoning incident and other acts perpetrated by the group, stating: [...] "The Rajneeshees committed the most significant crimes of their kind {{in the history of the}} United States ... The largest single incident of fraudulent marriages, the most massive scheme of wiretapping and bugging, and the largest mass poisoning." [...] Looking back on the incident, Skeels stated, [...] "We lost our innocence over this ... We really learned to be more suspicious ... The first significant biological attack on a U.S. community was not carried out by foreign terrorists smuggled into New York, but by legal residents of a U.S. community. The next time it happens it could be with more lethal agents ... We in public health <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>not</b> ready to deal with that." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to the American Psychiatric Association, a Western medical {{condition}} similar in many aspects to culturally bound syndromes, particularly the [...] "running" [...] syndromes, of which grisi siknis is part, is dissociative (or psychogenic) fugue. In any fugal state, a person appears normal, but has amnesia or identity forgetfulness. Dissociative fugue is distinguished by impulsive travel and amnesia, identity uncertainty, stress, and impediment to normal social function, {{all of which}} must not be influenced by substance intake. It is most often related to intense emotional stress and occurs randomly. However, some argue that [...] "running" [...] syndromes <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>not</b> dissociative fugue, and have no proper Western medical classification. Others contend that associating culturally bound symptoms with known ailments severely limits the discovery of new psychiatric disorders in folk culture. Edgardo Ruiz, PhD at the University of Pittsburgh argues that grisi siknis does not correlate with Western scientific cultural perspectives, and the cross-cultural translation of symptoms is an inaccurate device wherewith to understand the disease.|$|E
2500|$|John's gospel is {{the only}} {{canonical}} one that gives Thomas the Apostle a dramatic role and spoken part, and Thomas {{is the only}} character therein described as having apistos (unbelief), despite the failings of virtually all the Johannine characters {{to live up to}} the author's standards of belief. With respect to the famous story of [...] "Doubting Thomas", it is suggested that John may have been denigrating or ridiculing a rival school of thought. In another apparent contrast, John's text matter-of-factly presents a bodily resurrection as if this is a sine qua non of the faith; in contrast, Thomas' insights about the spirit-and-body are more nuanced. For Thomas, resurrection seems more a cognitive event of spiritual attainment, one even involving a certain discipline or asceticism. Again, an apparently denigrating portrayal in the [...] "Doubting Thomas" [...] story may either be taken literally, or as a kind of mock [...] "comeback" [...] to Thomas' logia: not as an outright censuring of Thomas, but an improving gloss. After all, Thomas' thoughts about the spirit and body <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>not</b> so different from those which John has presented elsewhere. John portrays Thomas as physically touching the risen Jesus, inserting fingers and hands into his body, and ending with a shout. Pagels interprets this as signifying one-upmanship by John, who is forcing Thomas to acknowledge Jesus' bodily nature. She writes that [...] "...he shows Thomas giving up his search for experiential truth – his 'unbelief' – to confess what John sees as the truth...". The point of these examples, as used by Riley and Pagels, is to support the argument that the text of Thomas must have existed and have gained a following at the time of the writing of John's Gospel, and that the importance of the Thomasine logia was great enough that John felt the necessity of weaving them into his own narrative.|$|E
