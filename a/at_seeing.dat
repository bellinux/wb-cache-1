5|$|Madre de Deus {{attracted}} {{all manner}} of traders, dealers, cutpurses and thieves from miles around, from as far as London and beyond. <b>At</b> <b>seeing</b> this huge vessel, pandemonium broke out amongst the townspeople; they visited the floating castle and sought out drunken sailors in taverns and pubs, buying, stealing, pinching and fighting for the takings. Local fishermen as well ventured aboard, further depleting the cargo.|$|E
5|$|The {{order and}} {{regularity}} that prevailed on board, {{from the moment}} the ship struck till she totally disappeared, far exceeded anything that I had thought could be effected by the best discipline; and it is the more to be wondered <b>at</b> <b>seeing</b> that most of the soldiers were but a short time in the service. Everyone did as he was directed and there was not a murmur or cry amongst them until the ship made her final plunge – all received their orders and carried them out as if they were embarking instead of going to the bottom – I never saw any embarkation conducted with so little noise or confusion.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Finch's successes have aroused media {{attention}}— in particular, {{the attention}} of investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith. While at first the Doctor feigns ignorance (but is barely able to restrain his pleasure <b>at</b> <b>seeing</b> her again), when Sarah Jane discovers the TARDIS during the night, he reveals his identity to her. Sarah Jane meets Rose and Mickey, with an immediate rivalry sparking between the two women. As the group searches the school, they find thirteen bat-like creatures asleep in Finch's office. Returning to Sarah Jane's car, the journalist reveals a battered, inactive K9 Mark III, who—once repaired—identifies the chip oil as Krillitane oil. Rose, unaware that the Doctor had even had past companions, confronts him; he replies sadly that, while she can {{spend the rest of}} her life with him, he cannot spend the rest of his life with her, so he must remain aloof.|$|E

5|$|During {{the later}} 19th century, the major {{shipping}} lines financed Swedish emigrant agents {{and paid for}} the production of large quantities of emigration propaganda. Much of this promotional material, such as leaflets, was produced by immigration promoters in the U.S. Propaganda and advertising by shipping line agents was often blamed for emigration by the conservative Swedish ruling class, which grew increasingly alarmed <b>at</b> <b>seeing</b> the agricultural labor force leave the country. It was a Swedish 19th-century cliché to blame the falling ticket prices and the pro-emigration propaganda of the transport system for the craze of emigration, but modern historians have varying views about the real importance of such factors. Brattne and Åkerman have examined the advertising campaigns and the ticket prices as a possible third force between push and pull. They conclude that neither advertisements nor pricing had any decisive influence on Swedish emigration. While the companies remain unwilling, , to open their archives to researchers, the limited sources available suggest that ticket prices did drop in the 1880s, but remained on average artificially high because of cartels and price-fixing. On the other hand, H. A. Barton states that the cost of crossing the Atlantic dropped drastically between 1865 and 1890, encouraging poorer Swedes to emigrate. The research of Brattne and Åkerman has shown that the leaflets sent out by the shipping line agents to prospective emigrants would not so much celebrate conditions in the New World, as simply emphasize the comforts and advantages of the particular company. Descriptions of life in America were unvarnished, and the general advice to emigrants brief and factual. Newspaper advertising, while very common, tended to be repetitive and stereotyped in content.|$|E
5|$|With {{help from}} its l'Cie {{soldiers}} and Class Zero, Rubrum destroys {{the forces of}} Concordia and Milites, uniting Orience under its flag. This triggers the arrival of Tempus Finis, with the Rursus Army emerging from the magical fortress Pandaemonium to wipe out Orience's population. Cid and Class Zero each travel to Pandaemonium: Cid attempts to become Agito and is transformed into the Rursus Arbiter by Gala, while Class Zero resolve to halt Tempus Finis. As Class Zero face the trials of the Arbiter, the Vermillion Bird Crystals offers them the chance to become l'Cie. Class Zero refuse the Crystal's offer and Rem is made a l'Cie in their place. Machina and Rem end up fighting each other in Pandaemonium: Rem is mortally wounded, and she and Machina turn to crystal. Severely weakened by the trials and demoralized <b>at</b> <b>seeing</b> Machina and Rem's condition, Class Zero are initially unable to defeat the Arbiter. Machina and Rem's spirits give them the strength they need to defeat the Arbiter and halt Tempus Finis. Fatally injured, Class Zero spend their final minutes imagining their possible post-war lives. They are found by Machina and Rem, who have returned to human form and, {{along with the rest}} of Orience, are allowed to remember the dead. In a post-credits sequence, it is said that the Crystal States fall into turmoil as the Crystals lose their powers. Machina and Rem unite Orience and rebuild the world, and Machina records Class Zero's history before dying with Rem at his side. A second playthrough reveals that Orience is trapped in a stable timeloop created by Arecia and Gala, the respective servants of the deities Pulse and Lindzei, as part of an experiment to find the gateway to the Unseen Realm. Competing with each other to open the gateway using a different method, both failed and reset the world for another attempt. By the events of Type-0, the experiment had been performed over six hundred million times.|$|E

They are joined there at StudioWest, in San Diego, by Shankar himself and Harrison's widow, Olivia, allowing the 90-year-old Shankar to offer his input. At one point Anoushka covers her father's eyes playfully – in response, it seems, to his reaction <b>at</b> <b>seeing</b> himself on screen, performing some four decades before.|$|E

The younger daughter of Lord Coningsby married Sir Charles Hanbury Williams, a well-known satirical poet, and was buried in the chapel of St. Erasmus, Westminster Abbey, in December 1781.|$|E

25|$|The Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet {{opened the}} 10th International Stars of the White Nights Festival with their {{reconstruction}} of La Bayadère at the Mariinsky Theatre on May 31, 2002, with Daria Pavlenko as Nikiya, Elvira Tarasova as Gamzatti, and Igor Kolb as Solor. The production received a mixed {{reaction from the}} St. Petersburg audience, which largely comprised the most prominent persons of the Russian ballet. The celebrated Ballerina of the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet Altynai Asylmuratova was seen weeping after the performance, allegedly because of her shock <b>at</b> <b>seeing</b> the ballet presented in this way. When the company included the production on their tours, it caused a sensation around the world, particularly in New York and London. To date the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet only perform the Vikharev production on special occasions.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{assassination}} of John F.

They expressed surprise <b>at</b> <b>seeing</b> Oswald's face in the newspapers, as they said they recognized him from a twist party at the home of Rubén Durán. They said that he was accompanied by two other men who looked like beatniks. In an October 5 report, Cobb informed the CIA of the conversation. Cobb wanted the women to tell American authorities what they knew, but advised them against going to the American embassy, instead suggesting that they go to Texas. Cobb was asked to leave Garro's home after their cat's back legs were found broken.|$|E
25|$|The {{human eye}} is good <b>at</b> <b>seeing</b> small {{differences}} in brightness over {{a relatively large}} area, but not so good at distinguishing the exact strength of a high frequency brightness variation. This allows one to greatly {{reduce the amount of}} information in the high frequency components. This is done by simply dividing each component in the frequency domain by a constant for that component, and then rounding to the nearest integer. This rounding operation is the only lossy operation in the whole process (other than chroma subsampling) if the DCT computation is performed with sufficiently high precision. As a result of this, it is typically the case that many of the higher frequency components are rounded to zero, and many of the rest become small positive or negative numbers, which take many fewer bits to represent.|$|E
