30|$|The article {{opens up}} fresh debate in aesthetical {{capacity}} of <b>academic</b> <b>and</b> Ghanaian traditional costumes in <b>academic</b> processions <b>and</b> {{sheds light on}} how the synergetic interaction of <b>academic</b> <b>and</b> traditional costumes spice up academic ceremonies in the University of Education, Winneba (UEW). Grounded in aesthetical balances, the study analyses the body of artistic ramifications in constructing <b>academic</b> pomposity, <b>and</b> signaling <b>academic</b> accomplishment <b>and</b> identities. Data gathered have been presented in simple narrative format. The researchers opted to offer visual interpretative account of the events—matriculation and congregation ceremonies, {{taking into account the}} symbolical essence and aesthetical dimensions of the <b>academic</b> <b>and</b> traditional costumes used in the ceremonies. Through participant observation and photographic evidences, the article delves into the aesthetical realms of <b>academic</b> costumes <b>and</b> its theatrical orchestrations in announcing visual identities of wearers. It posits that the construction of the visual iconographic identities through the use of both <b>academic</b> <b>and</b> traditional costuming in UEW is best understood in the Ghanaian conceptual and contextual cultural dialectic.|$|R
