5|$|Attachments between infants <b>and</b> <b>{{caregiver}}s</b> form {{even if this}} caregiver is {{not sensitive}} and responsive in social interactions with them. This has important implications. Infants cannot exit unpredictable or insensitive caregiving relationships. Instead they must manage themselves {{as best they can}} within such relationships. Based on her established Strange Situation Protocol, research by developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth in the 1960s and 1970s found that children will have different patterns of attachment depending primarily on how they experienced their early caregiving environment. Early patterns of attachment, in turn, shape — but do not determine — the individual's expectations in later relationships.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} {{rumination}} syndrome is unknown. However, studies have drawn {{a correlation between}} hypothesized causes {{and the history of}} patients with the disorder. In infants and the cognitively impaired, the disease has normally been attributed to over-stimulation and under-stimulation from parents <b>and</b> <b>caregivers,</b> causing the individual to seek self-gratification and self-stimulus due to the lack or abundance of external stimuli. The disorder has also commonly been attributed to a bout of illness, a period of stress in the individual's recent past, and to changes in medication.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the psychometric properties}} of the quality of life-Alzheimer disease (QOL-AD) Chinese version in patients with dementia in mainland, China and to compare patient <b>and</b> <b>caregiver</b> reports of patient QOL. Methods: The QOL-AD Chinese version was established following standard guidelines for cross-cultural adaptation of measures. The reliability was assessed by internal consistency and test–retest reliability. The validity included construct and convergent validity. A paired Stu-dent t test was performed to determine differences between patient reports <b>and</b> <b>caregiver</b> reports. Results: The reliability for both patient <b>and</b> <b>caregiver</b> reports on the QOL-AD was good (Cronbach a values of 0. 66 and 0. 87; intraclass correlation coefficients of 0. 84 and 0. 90 for patient <b>and</b> <b>caregiver</b> reports, respectively). The validity of patient <b>and</b> <b>caregiver</b> reports was supported by corre-lation with domain measures. All of the multitrait-multimethod correlations demonstrated a high relationship between patient reports <b>and</b> <b>caregiver</b> reports, ranging from 0. 26 to 0. 55. The caregivers rated patient QOL significantly higher than did the patients. Conclusion: The findings support the use of the Chinese version of the QOL-AD as a generic instrument to measure QOL of AD in mainland China. Further research is needed to clarify the relationship between patient <b>and</b> <b>caregiver</b> reports of patient QOL...|$|R
30|$|To {{assess whether}} children’s {{reported}} health {{varies according to}} the migration status of parents, we regressed categories measuring parental migration <b>and</b> <b>caregiver’s</b> identity (non-migrant, migrant fathers <b>and</b> <b>caregiver</b> mothers, migrant mothers <b>and</b> <b>caregiver</b> fathers, <b>and</b> both parents migrants <b>and</b> <b>caregiver</b> grandparents) on the full set of controls (Model 9, Table 3; Model 13, Table 4). In both countries, children whose mothers are caregivers when fathers migrate {{are more likely to}} have better health than children living in non-migrant households. Again, gender differences are observed, with girls less likely to be assessed with better health when fathers migrate <b>and</b> mothers are <b>caregivers</b> in the two contexts in focus of this study. Notably, in both countries, no significant effects are observed when mothers migrate <b>and</b> fathers are <b>caregivers</b> or when both parents migrate and children are cared for by grandparents.

This study explored patient <b>and</b> <b>caregiver</b> HRQOL <b>and</b> its association with unmet needs in YOD. Methods A cross-sectional design was used to study 215 community-dwelling YOD patients <b>and</b> their primary <b>caregivers.</b> Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to determine the relationship between unmet needs assessed with the Camberwell Assessment of Need for the Elderly scale <b>and</b> patient <b>and</b> <b>caregiver</b> HRQOL, controlling for other variables such as demographic characteristics, patient functional status, neuropsychiatric symptoms, <b>and</b> <b>caregiver</b> sense of competence. Results Patient HRQOL was not associated with unmet needs. However, we found that the unmet needs of both patient <b>and</b> <b>caregiver</b> were related to several domains of caregiver HRQOL. Conclusions This study shows that patient <b>and</b> <b>caregiver</b> unmet needs are related to caregiver HRQOL in YOD. However, the relationship between HRQOL and unmet needs is complex. The assessment of unmet needs within the context of HRQOL seems to be an important prerequisite for personalizing care in YOD. Adjusting supportive services to match the individual needs and preferences of these young patients <b>and</b> their <b>caregivers</b> is likely to enhance their quality of life...|$|R

25|$|Mary Ainsworth and John Bowlby founded modern {{attachment}} {{theory on}} studies {{of children and}} their caregivers.

Then, in the late 1980s, Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver applied attachment theory to adult relationships. Hazan and Shaver noticed that interactions between adults shared similarities to interactions between children <b>and</b> <b>caregivers.</b> For example, romantic partners desire to be close to one another. Adults feel comforted when their attachments are present and anxious or lonely when they are absent. Romantic relationships, for example, serve as a secure base that help people face the surprises, opportunities, and challenges life presents. Similarities such as these led Hazan and Shaver to extend attachment theory to adult relationships.|$|E

40|$|Sleep {{disturbances}} {{are common}} in persons with Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD) (Hart et al., 2003) and pose a great strain on their family caregivers (Hope, Keene, Gedling, Fairburn, 2 ̆ 6 Jacoby, 1998) including their emotional functioning (Schulz 2 ̆ 6 Martire, 2004). The current study {{is the first to}} examine the impact of daily sleep and mood in persons with AD on their caregiver 2 ̆ 7 s sleep and emotional functioning. The study examined sleep and mood across eight days in 40 family caregivers of persons with AD. It was hypothesized that poor sleep in the person with AD person would {{have a negative impact on}} caregiver emotional functioning the next day. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that sleep disruption or the mood in the person with AD would mediate the association between AD person sleep <b>and</b> <b>caregiver</b> mood. The results demonstrated a direct link between poor sleep in persons with AD <b>and</b> <b>caregiver</b> negative affect (NA), but not positive affect (PA).

40|$|To examine factors {{influencing}} the caregiver burden in adult-child <b>and</b> spousal <b>caregivers</b> of community-dwelling patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Baseline {{data from the}} 18 -month, prospective, observational GERAS study of 1, 497 patients with AD in France, Germany, and the UK were used. Analyses were performed on two groups of caregivers: spouses (n = 985) and adult children (n = 405). General linear models estimated patient <b>and</b> <b>caregiver</b> factors associated with subjective caregiver burden assessed using the Zarit Burden Interview. The caregiver burden increased with AD severity. Adult-child caregivers experienced a higher burden than spousal caregivers despite spending less time caring. Worse patient functional ability <b>and</b> more <b>caregiver</b> distress were independently associated with a greater burden in both adult-child <b>and</b> spousal <b>caregivers.</b> Additional factors were differentially associated with a greater caregiver burden in both groups. In adult-child caregivers these were: living with the patient, patient living in an urban location, and patient with a fall in the past 3 months; in spouses the factors were: <b>caregiver</b> gender (female) <b>and</b> age (younger), and more years of patient education.
