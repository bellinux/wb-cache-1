5|$|Because of its Ottoman past, Skopje {{has more}} mosques than churches. Religious {{communities}} often complain <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of infrastructure and new {{places of worship}} are often built. Skopje is the seat of many Macedonian religious organisations, such as the Macedonian Orthodox Church and the Islamic Religious Union of Macedonia. It has an Orthodox cathedral and seminary, several madrasahs, a Roman Catholic cathedral and a synagogue.|$|E

5|$|Steinbeck {{was right}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of popular appeal, however: the unusual mixture of taxonomic data and travelogue meant the book {{struggled}} to find an audience. Few copies were printed and it was soon all but forgotten. The country's entry into the war and plummeting book sales also had an effect. Ricketts' share of the revenues from sales did not even provide him with {{the money to pay}} back Steinbeck for financing the journey.|$|E
5|$|The French Directory did as well. In mid April, {{suffering}} from an nephritic complaint, Jourdan handed over command to {{his chief of}} staff, general of division Jean Augustin Ernouf, and returned to Paris to complain <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of men, the inexperience of the men he had, their supplies, and the size, experience, and supply of the army he had to face. He found little sympathy there, and when he told the Directory that he was ill, tendering his resignation, it was accepted.|$|E
5|$|After the French {{conquest of}} Algeria, Abdelkader El Djezairi {{declared}} war against France, and requested assistance from Sultan Abd al-Rahman of Morocco. When the Sultan responded favorably, it triggered the Franco-Moroccan War. France sent warships to bombard Tangier on 6 August 1844, destroying {{large parts of}} the city and its defenses. The French then bombarded Essaouira, and occupied the Iles Purpuraires. After the French army defeated the Moroccan cavalry at the Battle of Isly on 14 August 1844, Sultan Abd al-Rahman asked for peace with France, leading to the signing of the Treaty of Tangier on 10 September 1844. Morocco's defeat caused a revolt in Rabat; in Salé, the city's nobility, known as the Sharif, {{sent a letter to the}} Sultan complaining <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of weapons and ammunition in the city.|$|E

5|$|Although Bellone would {{normally}} be much faster than the large British warship, the light winds and Rattlesnakes determined pursuit prevented the privateer from escaping and at 17:00, Powerful {{was close enough to}} open fire. Despite the uneven nature of the combat, Bellone unexpectedly resisted the British attack for another hour and 45 minutes, causing more damage to Powerful than she received herself. The privateer was later taken into British service as a sixth rate frigate and prize money was paid for the captured vessels, but the action prompted questions in subsequent histories <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of efficiency in British gunnery.|$|E
5|$|During Warwick's exile, King Edward {{stripped}} Montagu of the Earldom of Northumberland, {{making him}} Marquis of Montagu instead. John Neville {{appears to have}} seen this as a reduction in rank, and accepted it with poor grace. He seems particularly to have complained <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of landed estate that his new marquisate brought with it, calling it a 'pie's nest'. When the Earl of Warwick and Clarence returned, they distracted Edward with a rebellion in the north, which the king ordered Montagu to raise troops to repress in the king's name. Montagu, however, having raised a small army, turned against Edward, almost capturing him at Olney, Buckinghamshire; the king, with his other brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, fled into exile in Burgundy.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{relaunch}} of Star Trek in 2009 {{with a new}} cast playing those roles seen in The Original Series, {{there was}} commentary online <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of female characters and whether Rand might be appearing in future installments. While the sequel, Star Trek Into Darkness, was in production, Rand was one of five characters who was stated not to be appearing in the film by writer Roberto Orci. But there was still speculation {{at the time of}} the broadcast of the first trailer about who Alice Eve was portraying in the film. The options given by Tor.com was that it was either Janice Rand or Carol Marcus. Daily Variety reported that she was cast as someone new to the franchise, but she was actually cast as Marcus.|$|E

5|$|In time, the {{ineffectiveness}} of the CIP {{began to}} concern the Eisenhower administration, who were worried <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of industrialization. The corruption that permeated the initiative remained a problem. The rural peasants of Vietnam, who comprised more than 80% of the population, were {{unaffected by the}} aid package except for the resentment that it instilled in them when they observed the relative affluence of their city counterparts compared to their own impoverished state. However, the program was credited with transforming the textile industry, as 25,000 sewing machines were imported {{in the first year}} of its operation.|$|E
5|$|Marie St. Clare – Wife of Augustine, {{she is a}} self-absorbed woman {{without a}} hint of {{compassion}} for those around her, including her own family. Given to an unending list of (apparently imaginary) physical maladies, she continually complains <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of sympathy she is receiving. She has separated her personal maid, Mammy, from her own two children because they would interfere with her duties. As Marie drives Mammy to exhaustion, she criticizes her for selfishly seeking to attend her own family. Upon the unexpected death of Augustine, Marie countermands the legal process that would have given Tom his freedom.|$|E

5|$|One of {{only two}} machine gun battalions {{available}} for the defending British and Commonwealth forces, as preparations were made to repulse the expected Japanese assault across the Johore Strait, the battalion was split up to provide support to troops from the 22nd and 27th Australian Infantry Brigades and the 44th Indian Infantry Brigade around {{the western part of}} the island, where the Japanese assault was expected. On 7 February, due to concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of defending infantry, about 90 machine gun reinforcements, who had been hastily formed into a sixth company—'E'—were detached at this time to form part of a 400-strong Special Reserve Battalion, initially under the command of an officer from the 2/19th Infantry Battalion and later taken over by Major Albert Saggers, formerly of the 2/4th Machine Gun Battalion.|$|E

Brazilian Dreams received mixed reviews by critics, some praising the performers and the musical selection, and others being critical <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of improvement on the arrangements on the classic songs of the genre included.

5|$|Franz Ferdinand and Sophie gave {{up their}} planned program in favor of visiting the wounded from the bombing, at the hospital. Count Harrach took up a {{protective}} position on the left-hand running board of Franz Ferdinand's car. This is confirmed by photographs of the scene outside the Town Hall. At 10:45a.m., Franz Ferdinand and Sophie {{got back into the}} motorcade, once again in the third car. In order to avoid the city center, General Oskar Potiorek decided that the royal car should travel straight along the Appel Quay to the Sarajevo Hospital. However, the driver, Leopold Lojka, took a right turn into Franz Josef Street. The {{reason for this is that}} Potiorek's aide Eric(h) von Merrizzi was in the hospital, and was therefore unable to give Lojka the information about the change in plans and the driving route. The Sarajevo Chief of Police Edmund Gerde (who had earlier repeatedly protested <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of security precautions for the visit) was asked to tell the drivers of the new route but in the confusion and tensions of the moment neglected to do so.|$|E
5|$|Moonraker is {{the third}} novel by the British author Ian Fleming to feature his fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond. It was {{published}} by Jonathan Cape on 5 April 1955 and featured a cover design conceived by Fleming. The plot is derived from a Fleming screenplay that was too short for a full novel so he added {{the passage of the}} bridge game between Bond and the industrialist Hugo Drax. In {{the latter half of the}} novel, Bond is seconded to Drax's staff as the businessman builds the Moonraker, a prototype missile designed to defend England. Unknown to Bond, Drax is German, an ex-Nazi now working for the Soviets; his plan is to build the rocket, arm it with a nuclear warhead, and fire it at London. Uniquely for a Bond novel, Moonraker is set entirely in Britain, which raised comments from some readers, complaining <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of exotic locations.|$|E
5|$|The city {{opened up}} bidding for the {{construction}} of the network in 2005, eventually receiving bids from eight different internet service providers. Of these eight, Atlanta-based EarthLink and Minnetonka-based US Internet were selected as semifinalists, and each company set up a trial program in Minneapolis before the final decision was made. During this process, outcry arose from both members of the Institute for Local Self Reliance <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of public hearings {{on the subject of the}} network, and from Qwest, another internet service provider who had placed a bid to build and run the network, about the city's plan to be involved in the wireless internet business at all. The deputy chief information officer of Minneapolis, Bill Beck, stated that the city was worried about legal restrictions and lawsuits, which were key reasons for the lack of transparency in the process.|$|E
