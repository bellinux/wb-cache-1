50|$|The various {{disorders}} {{that are}} broadly called 'operational stress injuries' each {{have their own}} bodies of research into various treatments and therapies. Most treatments can either be considered pharmacological, such as antidepressant or <b>antianxiety</b> <b>medication,</b> or psychosocial therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy. For many patients a combined approach is used, with medications helping to stabilize moods and symptoms while behavioural therapy helps to address underlying memories, cognitions, situation appraisals, and other thinking patterns.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To report our {{successful}} {{treatment of}} acute symptoms of {{posttraumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD). By the use of stellate ganglion block (SGB) and pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) to the stellate ganglion(SG), sequentially. Background. A 48 -year-old male a victim of armed robbery, who presented with extreme symptoms consistent with the diagnosis of PTSD. He was treated with <b>antianxiety</b> <b>medications,</b> as well as psychotherapy, but his symptoms persisted. Methods. Fifty-five days post trauma, we administered a SGB to the patient. One month later, we administered PRF to the right SG. We repeated the pulsed radiofrequency 30 weeks post trauma and performed a second SGB two weeks after that. Results. After the SGB, the patient experienced a major reduction in anxiety. Over the next week his improved allowing a significant reduction of <b>antianxiety</b> <b>medications.</b> One month later the symptoms returned and again subsided substantially following PRF, and that relief lasted four months. The patient than required another following PRF and a SGB with good responses. Conclusion. We report that selective blockade of the stellate ganglion via injection and the treatment with PRF, relieved our patient's symptoms of PTSD.

40|$|Background: Depressive {{disorders}} {{greatly increase}} suicide risk; however, {{little is known}} about the contribution of comorbid anxiety disorders or anxiety symptoms to the risk of suicide death among depressed patients. We examined whether depressed veterans with comorbid anxiety had higher risks of suicide death. Methods: Using VA administrative databases we identified 887, 859 patients with depression. We then used univariate and multivariate logistic regression, controlling for demographics and substance use disorders, to determine the odds ratios of completed suicide associated with individual comorbid anxiety disorders, the presence of any comorbid anxiety disorder, the prescription of an <b>antianxiety</b> <b>medication,</b> or the prescription of a high dose of an <b>antianxiety</b> <b>medication.</b> Results: In multivariate analyses, the odds of completed suicide were significantly increased for patients with panic disorder (OR 1. 26, 95 % CI: 1. 04 – 1. 53), generalized anxiety disorder (OR 1. 27, 95 % CI: 1. 09 – 1. 47), and anxiety disorder, not otherwise specified (OR 1. 25, 95 % CI: 1. 12 – 1. 38). The odds of completed suicide were also greater among patients who received any <b>antianxiety</b> <b>medication</b> (OR 1. 71, 95 % CI: 1. 55 – 1. 88), and were further increased among those who received high dose treatment (OR 2. 26, 95 % CI: 1. 98 – 2. 57). Odds of completed suicide were decreased among patients with comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (OR 0. 87, 95 % CI: 0. 77 – 0. 97), and there was no statistically significant relationship between social phobia, obsessive–compulsive disorder, and all other anxiety disorders and suicide. Conclusions: These findings emphasize the importance of comorbid anxiety disorders and symptoms in increasing suicide risk among depressed patients and may inform suicide prevention efforts amon...|$|E

40|$|Objective: This study {{compared}} {{the probability of}} receiving anxiety treatment during a physician visit to primary care practices with and without an electronic health record (EHR). Methods: The 2007 – 2010 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey was used to identify visits for anxiety (N= 290). The outcome was receipt of anxiety treatment. The independent variable was {{the presence of a}} fully functioning EHR. Logistic regression was used to conduct the analysis. Results: Patients who were seen in practices with a fully functioning EHR had lower odds of being offered <b>antianxiety</b> <b>medication</b> (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=. 37, 95 % confidence interval [CI]=. 15 –. 90, p=. 028), mental health counseling (AOR=. 43, CI=. 18 – 1. 04, p=. 061), and any anxiety treatment (AOR=. 40, CI=. 15 – 1. 05, p=. 062) compared with patients at practices without a fully functioning EHR.

40|$|Background: Despite {{a marked}} {{increase}} in the number of persons seeking help for anxiety disorders, the care provided may not be evidence based, especially when delivered by nonspecialists. Since anxiety disorders are most often treated in primary care, quality improvement interventions, such as the Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) intervention, are needed in primary care. Research Design: This study is a randomized controlled trial of a collaborative care effectiveness intervention for anxiety disorders. Subjects: Approximately 1040 adult primary care patients with at least one of four anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder or social anxiety disorder) will be recruited from four national sites. Intervention: Anxiety clinical specialists (ACSs) deliver education and behavioral activation to intervention patients and monitor their symptoms. Intervention patients choose cognitive–behavioral therapy, <b>antianxiety</b> <b>medications</b> or both in “stepped-care ” treatment, which varies according to clinical needs. Control patients receive usual care from their primary care clinician. The innovations of CALM include the following: flexibility to treat any one of the four anxiety disorders, co-occurring depression, alcohol abuse or both; use of on-site clinicians to conduct initial assessments; and computer-assisted psychotherapy delivery. Evaluation: Anxiety symptoms, functioning, satisfaction with care and health care utilization are assessed at 6 -month intervals for 18 months...|$|R

To our knowledge, {{there is a lack}} of published reports that link psychiatric symptoms directly with miliary TB (either alone or co-occurring with other medical symptoms). Mental health workers may, therefore, not consider, and consequently miss, this important diagnosis. Here we are reporting a case of cyclical anxiety occurring in a 67 -year-old patient. For 3 years prior to admission, the patient failed to respond to multiple courses of different <b>antianxiety</b> <b>medications.</b> The patient required hospital admission as he deteriorated and had a reduced level of consciousness. A chest X-ray revealed bilateral nodules and a magnetic resonance imaging scan showed multiple enhancing tuberculous lesions in the cerebral white matter, brain stem, and cerebellum. A diagnosis of miliary TB was finally made. Several characteristics of this case suggest that the diagnosed anxiety disorder was due to miliary TB. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that generalized anxiety disorder preceded the onset of miliary TB or that both diseases were coincidental. The report serves as a reminder that organic causes for psychiatric symptoms always need to be considered, particularly if they follow an atypical pattern or fail to improve with usual psychiatric medications.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2014. Includes bibliographical references. Both {{legal and}} illicit use of {{prescription}} drugs during pregnancy {{is thought to be}} increasingly common in the state of Hawaiʻi, based on trends demonstrated elsewhere in the country and throughout the world. Prescription opioids, along with <b>antianxiety</b> and antidepressant <b>medications</b> are of special concern, both for their prevalence and for the potential risks associated with using these drugs during pregnancy. The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate prescription drug use during pregnancy in Hawaiʻi, with a focus on opioids and <b>antianxiety</b> and antidepressant <b>medications.</b> The first of three studies sought to determine the prevalence of prescription opioid drug use during pregnancy in Hawaiʻi, describe differences in prescription opioid drug use during pregnancy in Hawaiʻi by maternal demographic characteristics, and investigate possible predictors of prescription opioid drug use during pregnancy through the use of multivariable logistic regression. The second study aimed to determine whether prescription opioid use during pregnancy was associated with poorer birth outcomes among users when compared to non-users in Hawaiʻi; specifically focusing on associations between prescription opioid use during pregnancy and risk of small for gestational age, preterm, or low birth weight deliveries among women giving birth to live, singleton infants in Hawaiʻi. Study three attempted to describe the under-studied topics of anxiety and depression before, during, and after pregnancy, along with related help-seeking behaviors and treatment strategies, for which there is a scarcity of information in Hawaiʻi. Findings from the three studies covered in this dissertation confirm that {{use of prescription}} opioids and <b>antianxiety</b> and antidepressant <b>medications</b> is relatively common during pregnancy in Hawaiʻi. They also provide more detailed information on usage patterns, differences by demographic characteristics, and associated risk factors and birth and maternal health outcomes. All three also provide suggestions for future research avenues in order to more fully understand the complete landscape of prescription drug use during pregnancy in Hawaiʻi...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} was to investigate changes in self-reported cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden associated with psychopathology for Australia from 2004 to 2008. METHOD: Data analyzed were from 32, 073 participants aged ≥ 25 years from the 2004 - 2005 or 2007 - 2008 National Health Surveys. Lifetime diagnosis of CVD (heart attack or stroke) was by self-report. Psychopathology {{was determined by the}} 10 -item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (using scores ≥ 30) and use of antidepressants or <b>antianxiety</b> (AD/AA) <b>medications.</b> RESULTS: The prevalence of CVD (4. 1 % to 4. 5 %, P=. 045) had increased slightly from 2004 to 2008 for the general population, but not among those with psychopathology. On average, psychological distress only [odds ratio (OR) 2. 00; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 52 - 2. 62] and AD/AA medications with (OR 2. 02; 1. 41 - 2. 88) and without psychological distress (OR 1. 24; 1. 00 - 1. 55) were associated with increased odds of CVD over the 4 -year period, independent of sociodemographic, lifestyle and chronic disease covariates. Both psychological distress only (OR 1. 61; 1. 15 - 2. 25) and AD/AA medications with psychological distress (OR 1. 62; 1. 08 - 2. 44) conferred higher odds of CVD than AD/AA medications without psychological distress. CONCLUSION: In comparison to those without psychopathology, the odds of self-reported CVD were persistently higher among people with psychopathology from 2004 to 2008, particularly for psychological distress.

40|$|A {{substantial}} number of individuals evaluated for complaints of chest pain do not suffer from coronary heart disease (CHD). Studies show that many patients who complain of symptoms that might be caused by CHD, such as shortness of breath or chest pain, may actually have an anxiety disorder. Gender differences in how patients present with these symptoms have not been adequately explored. The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore possible gender differences in the presentation of patients with CHD-like symptoms. Two groups were examined, one comprising 6, 381 individuals self-referred for electron beam tomography (EBT) studies and a subset of these individuals who defined a 2 ̆ 2 low-risk 2 ̆ 2 group based on the absence of risk factors for CHD and low coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores. We explored gender differences in symptom presentation in each group after controlling for relevant variables by using logistic regression models. These analyses showed that women were significantly more likely than men to endorse CHD symptoms that might also be caused by an anxiety disorder. Women in the low risk group reported CHD symptoms also referable to anxiety more often than men, but unlike men did not complain primarily of chest pain. Women were also more likely to have been prescribed <b>antianxiety</b> or antidepressant <b>medication.</b> In previous studies, non-cardiac chest pain has been considered a hallmark of anxiety in individuals seen in medical settings. This study suggests that in individuals with low risk for CHD chest pain was not related to gender, but other anxiety-related symptoms including heart flutter, lightheadedness, nausea, and shortness of breath were more likely to be reported in women than in men...|$|R
