5|$|Dmowski admired Italian fascism. In {{the summer}} of 1926 Dmowski wrote a series of {{articles}} admiring Mussolini <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italian</b> fascist model, and helped organize the Camp of Great Poland (OWP), a broad anti-Sanacja front modeled on Italian fascism that was known for its anti-Jewish rhetoric and violence. Later he nonetheless tried to ensure that OWM would not blindly imitate the Italian or German models.|$|E

As a result, six bomber squadrons of the Vichy French Air Force (Armée de l'Air de Vichy) and four squadrons of the Vichy French Navy (Marine nationale de Vichy) were employed in the operation. The 64 bombers flew from bases in Oran, Tafaroui (in Algeria), Meknes, Mediouna, and Port Lyautey (in Morocco).

5|$|Beginning in July 1943, No. 450 Squadron {{took part}} in the Allied {{invasion}} of Sicily <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italian</b> campaign, primarily in the close support role. Its aircraft attacked targets in Yugoslavia as well as in Sicily and Italy. The squadron began converting from Kittyhawks to North American P-51 Mustang fighters in May 1945, but never saw action with its new aircraft. It was disbanded in August 1945 following the conclusion of hostilities, having suffered 63 fatal casualties during the war. Today, by agreement with the RAAF, the squadron's number is carried by a Royal Canadian Air Force unit, 450 Tactical Helicopter Squadron.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1906, most {{leaders from}} Azusa Street had spun off to form other congregations, such as the 51st Street Apostolic Faith Mission, the Spanish AFM, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italian</b> Pentecostal Mission. These {{missions}} were largely composed of immigrant or ethnic groups. The Southeast United States was a particularly prolific area of growth for the movement, since Seymour's approach gave a useful explanation for a charismatic spiritual climate {{that had already been}} taking root in those areas. Other new missions were based on preachers who had charisma and energy. Nearly all of these new churches were founded among immigrants and the poor.|$|E

Henry IV also demanded that three French cardinals go to Rome, and they were present at Clement's death on 3 March 1605.|$|E

5|$|The McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) AV-8B Harrier II is a {{single-engine}} ground-attack {{aircraft that}} constitutes {{the second generation}} of the Harrier Jump Jet family. Capable of vertical or short takeoff and landing (V/STOL), the aircraft was designed in the late 1970s as an Anglo-American development of the British Hawker Siddeley Harrier, the first operational V/STOL aircraft. Named after a bird of prey, it is primarily employed on light attack or multi-role missions, ranging from close air support of ground troops to armed reconnaissance. The AV-8B {{is used by the}} United States Marine Corps (USMC), the Spanish Navy, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italian</b> Navy. A variant of the AV-8B, the British Aerospace Harrier II, was developed for the British military, while another, the TAV-8B, is a dedicated two-seat trainer.|$|E
