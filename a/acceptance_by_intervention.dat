40|$|This paper aims {{to reflect}} on the {{opportunities}} and challenges of the learning process in practice and explores the case of a local authority school Pilot Wellbeing Programme (PWP) intervention. The aim of the PWP was to create the best workplace conditions and circumstances for people to flourish and mature, both individually and collectively. Findings show that the socio-physical environment plays a significant and leading role in supporting this work, as does the consistent modelling of higher level behaviours including integrity, respect and <b>acceptance</b> <b>by</b> <b>intervention</b> managers and school leadership teams. It was also important that the change processes were continually tailored and nuanced to meet the evolving needs of the staff and organisation throughout the intervention. Emphasis was also placed on encouraging individual involvement and commitment by implementing inclusive measures that fostered trust and openness...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{some simple}} and natural restrictions of regulated pushdown automata. Most importantly, it studies one-turn regulated pushdown automata and proves that they characterize {{the family of}} recursively enumerable languages. In fact, this characterization holds even for atomic one-turn regulated pushdown automata of a reduced size. This result is established in terms of <b>acceptance</b> <b>by</b> final state and empty pushdown, <b>acceptance</b> <b>by</b> final state, and <b>acceptance</b> <b>by</b> empty pushdown...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{suggests}} a new investigation {{area of the}} formal language theory—regulated automata. Specifically, it investigates pushdown automata that regulate {{the use of their}} rules by control languages. It proves that this regulation has no effect on the power of pushdown automata if the control languages are regular. However, the pushdown automata regulated by linear control languages characterize the family of recursively enumerable languages. All these results are established in terms of (A) <b>acceptance</b> <b>by</b> final state, (B) <b>acceptance</b> <b>by</b> empty pushdown, and (C) <b>acceptance</b> <b>by</b> final state and empty pushdown. In its conclusion, this paper formulates several open problems...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Hearing {{impairment}} {{is known}} to have various effects upon both the person with hearing impairment (PHI) and their communication partners (CPs). In addition, CPs are reported {{to play an important role}} in making the decision to seek a consultation and the <b>acceptance</b> of <b>intervention</b> <b>by</b> the PHI. The overall aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the role of the CP in the audiological enablement/rehabilitation of the PHI keeping clinical practice in focus. Method: A literature review was conducted using a number of resources including electronic databases, books and websites. Results: An overview of the literature was presented in the following sections: 1) Factors influencing the audiological enablement/rehabilitation of the PHI; 2) Effect of the PHI's hearing impairment on their CPs; 3) CPs' influence on their PHI's audiological enablement/rehabilitation; 4) Positive experiences reported by CPs of the PHI; 5) Models to represent CPs within the social network context of the PHI; and 6) CP involvement in the audiological enablement/rehabilitation. This paper also identifies gaps in the literature and provides recommendations for further research. Conclusion: It is clear that involvement of the CP in the audiological enablement/rehabilitation can result in mutual advantages for both the PHI and their CPs. © 2012 Informa Healthcare...|$|R
