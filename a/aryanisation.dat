50|$|From the Nidhanpur copper {{inscriptions}} {{issued by}} King Bhaskarbarman, it is {{learned that the}} region has been within the Kamrupa Kingdom for about a hundred years since the 6th century. The <b>Aryanisation</b> of the region {{under the leadership of}} the pioneer immigrant Brahmins with plough-based agriculture as economic basis had its beginning during this period. From the Kalapur copper plates issued by Samata Marundanatha, it is learned that in the 7th century, this region, along with foothills of North Cachar Hills had passed on to the Samatata Kingdom of the Eastern Bengal. Of course, there is no direct evidence to prove it. In the 10th century, King Srichandra of the renowned Chandra Dynasty of Eastern Bengal incorporated the entire region within his Vanga Kingdom. During this period, the Chandrapura Matha or monastery, situated at Panchakhanda (8 miles From Karimganj town, now in Bangladesh), became a very reputed centre of learning. According to the renowned historian D.C. Sarkar, the Chandrapura Matha was the greatest centre of Hindu-learning in the entire Eastern India of the early period. From two Bhatera inscriptions of Govindakeshava Deva and Ishana Deva, it is learnt that there was an independent Srihatta Rajya in the 12th century within which the entire Karimganj District along with a major portion of the Cachar plains were incorporated.|$|E
40|$|The {{bachelor}} {{thesis on}} the topic of Czech <b>aryanisation</b> and anti [...] semitism in thirties is describing, on the background of historical events, displays of hate against Jews in a period of liberal first republic and authoritarian second republic. The first chapter of this thesis follows activities of anti-semites and individual Jewish streams during the first republic. One part of this chapter is composed of author's analysis about a periodical named Vlajka, which was being published by a fascist organisation. In the second chapter, there are described fascist actions against Jews during the second republic and also anti-semitic exposures of the party Národní jednota. Besides, the chapter is also dealing with anti-semitic legislation. The last, third chapter is engaged in the problems of Czech <b>aryanisation</b> and tries to explain its rising illusion. The end of this chapter is also dealing with a historical period of Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, to explain the process of expropriation of Jewish properties in Czech lands. So the purpose of this bachelor thesis is to define how the Anti [...] Semitism was expressed during thirties in Czech lands...|$|E

40|$|The ancient {{names of}} Assam were Kamrupa and Pragjyotisa, {{which had been}} {{inhabited}} by the Kirata or Mongoloid people before the Aryan culture could spread its influence over the North Eastern part of India. Before {{the advent of the}} Aryan civilization, the Austric-Mongolian and Dravidian culture was the prevalent culture of the people of this area. According to some scholar, the Aryans advent in North East India was occurrence of the pre-Buddhist period. The period of the Brahmins was followed by the Buddhist period, so far as the cultural history of India is concerned. In comparatively, ancient inscriptions of Assam, we find that, the high caste Aryans like Brahmans, Shatriyas and Kalitas entered into Assam and began to settle here even during the Pre-Christian era. The mention of Kamrupa and Devoka in the Allahabad pillar inscription of the Gupta king Samudragupta has an important bearing on the <b>Aryanisation</b> of North East India. In the domain of political system, it is all probable that the ancient Assam populated by the non-Khmer group of the Austric and the Tibeto-Burman people was in tribal state of society. Narakasura and Bhagadutta, the legendary kings of Assam were probably the first monarchical rulers and they were in all probability the Aryanised or Hunduised Mongoloid persons. In other words, the tribal political system of Assam was changed into monarchical system by the influence of the Aryan culture...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates Rosenthal's high-design {{identity}} and image construction primarily, although not exclusively, through the post-World War II period {{and into the}} era of the post- modern. Empirical study of Rosenthal carried out by Bernd Fritz (1984, and 1989) situates Rosenthal's commitment to high design to 1950. The present thesis isolates and discusses important threads of continuity between Rosenthal's pre- and post- World War II identity construction strategies, looking at how these asserted continuity with ceramics, familial and national pasts. As Lampugnani has observed, in many features of Germany's sweep towards renewal after World War II, tradition and continuity competed with modernism for pre-eminence in the reconstruction of the nation. ' This thesis academically embeds and investigates Rosenthal within this cultural interpretation. It argues that the predominant and richest reconstruction strategy enlisted was modernity, and that Rosenthal reconstructed itself after 1945 via a range of discernable strategies informed by styles and ideologies of the modern. In this way, Rosenthal constitutes a significant case study in postwar reconstruction because it represents the second generation of industrial enterprises within Germany to look towards typologies of modernity for product and identity solutions. After critically introducing its subject in Chapter One, Chapter Two interrogates existing literature covering Rosenthal. Chapter Three states the inter-disciplinary research methodology of the thesis, commenting upon interpretive paradigms and significant influences that informed the study. From Chapter Four onwards, the thesis adopts a thematic investigation, each chapter concentrating upon an individual focal examination. Chapter Four embeds Rosenthal within the comparatively newer academic perspectives of narrative analysis; looking {{for the first time at}} the firm's development and manipulation of mythbiographical text. Chapter Five enlists hitherto unrecognised documentary evidence to offer a new contextualisation of Rosenthal's <b>aryanisation,</b> interpreting its product, family and manufacturing identity under the management of the infamous Deutsche Arbetisfront (or DAF, the Nazi-run, German Labour Front) during the battle to create 'model' industrial enterprises throughout Germany by 1939. Chapter Six looks at discourses of aesthetic modernity, and at an Americanisation of Rosenthal's design during the 1950 s, also acknowledging the importance of Scandinavian design in the post-war German design climate. Chapter Seven addresses Rosenthal's uneasy relationships with Germany's Gute Form movement of the 1960 s and 1970 s, and identifies the company's prominent participation in the German cultural repatriation of a Bauhaus legacy. Chapter Eight examines Rosenthal's association with ideologies and cultural statuses of fine art, while Chapter Nine proposes both the ideologies and realities of exhibition and display served significant, strategic roles in Rosenthal's post-war identity mantle. Chapter Ten concludes the thesis by examining and interpreting Rosenthal's aspirational relationship with institutional statuses of the museum, presenting a case study in the firm's relationship with the Victoria & Albert Museum.
