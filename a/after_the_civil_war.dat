5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>War,</b> Goodrich Castle {{remained}} with the Earls of Kent until 1740, {{when it was}} sold by Henry Grey to Admiral Thomas Griffin. Griffin undertook some restoration of the castle but retained it as a ruin.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>War,</b> Powell {{was made}} a baronet by Charles II. Although it is {{unrecorded}} when Bodiam Castle was dismantled (slighted), it was probably after it was bought by Powell. During and <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>War,</b> many castles were slighted {{to prevent them from}} being reused. Not all were destroyed completely, and in some cases care was taken not to unnecessarily deface the structure. At Bodiam, it was deemed sufficient to dismantle the barbican, the bridges, and the buildings inside the castle. When Nathaniel Powell died in 1674 or 1675, Bodiam Castle was passed on to his son, also called Nathaniel. After the second Nathaniel, the castle came into the possession of Elizabeth Clitherow, his daughter-in-law.|$|E

5|$|James Buchanan {{was easily}} elected President in 1856. Although he {{remained}} committed to Cuban annexation, he was hindered by popular opposition {{and the growing}} sectional conflict.

5|$|During the Civil War {{the largest}} {{substantial}} {{conflict in the}} area was the Battle of Naseby in 1645, although a minor skirmish in the town resulted {{in the killing of}} a parliamentarian officer Captain John Sawyer. Severe reprisals followed which included the carrying off to Northampton of the parish priest, Thomas Jones, and 40 prisoners by a group of Roundheads. However, <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>War</b> Wellingborough was home to a colony of Diggers. Little is known about this period.|$|E

5|$|During {{the decades}} <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>War,</b> St. Louis grew {{to become the}} nation's fourth largest city, after New York City, Philadelphia, and Chicago.

The period culminated with the 1904 World's Fair and 1904 Summer Olympics, which were held concurrently in St. Louis.|$|E
5|$|Federal Reconstruction in Mobile began <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>War</b> and {{effectively}} ended in 1874 {{when the local}} Democrats gained control of the city government. The {{last quarter of the}} 19th century was a time of economic depression and municipal insolvency for Mobile. One example can be provided by the value of Mobile's exports during this period of depression. The value of exports leaving the city fell from $9 million in 1878 to $3million in 1882.|$|E
5|$|Just as the Black Codes, enacted <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>War</b> to {{restrict}} {{the free exercise of}} those rights, were substitutes for the slave system, so the exclusion of Negroes from white communities became a substitute for the Black Codes. And when racial discrimination herds men into ghettos and makes their ability to buy property turn on the color of their skin, then it too is a relic of slavery.|$|E

5|$|Tubman {{traveled}} to New York, Boston, and Washington, D.C., {{to speak out}} in favor of women's voting rights.

When the National Federation of Afro-American Women was founded in 1896, Tubman was the keynote speaker at its first meeting.|$|E
5|$|When the war ended, the state's Democrats {{were upset}} about their wartime {{treatment}} by the Republicans, but they staged a quick comeback. Indiana {{became the first}} state <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>War</b> to elect a Democratic governor, Thomas Hendricks. His rise to the governor's office initiated a period of Democratic control in the state that reversed many of the political gains made by the Republican Party during the war.|$|E

5|$|After {{living in}} his new house for three years, Big Jim died of {{tuberculosis}} on October14, 1858. His widow, Elizabeth, {{lived in the house}} until <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>War.</b> In 1867 or 1869, she sold the house, the Collins Tract and the remainder of Lot Number20 to Charles Harmison (1823–1896) for $8,500, moving with her remaining children to Missouri (where she died in 1883). The cost of building the house financially strained the Parsons family; historian Catherine Snider Long suggests that Elizabeth Miller Parsons sold the house as a result of additional, war-related financial stress from which the family could not recover.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>War</b> {{and until}} his {{transfer}} back East in 1887, he served {{primarily on the}} western frontier. He engaged many Native American tribes, dealt with many types of renegades and explored vast areas of uncharted territory from Texas to Arizona. During the Spanish–American War, he commanded an occupation force {{and became the first}} military governor of Puerto Principe, Cuba. After 38 continuous years of service to his country, he retired from the Army on October 19, 1899, as a brigadier general. After his retirement, he became a speaker and a writer.|$|E
5|$|Although Oklahoma {{was not yet}} a state {{during the}} Civil War, the Tulsa area did see its share of fighting. The Battle of Chusto-Talasah {{took place on the}} north side of Tulsa and a number of battles and skirmishes took place in nearby counties. After the War, the tribes signed Reconstruction {{treaties}} with the federal government that in some cases required substantial land concessions. In the years <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>War</b> and around the turn of the century, the area along the Arkansas River that is now Tulsa was periodically home to or visited by a series of colorful outlaws, including the legendary Wild Bunch, the Dalton Gang, and Little Britches.|$|E
