2500|$|Sailing skiffs are {{the fastest}} and arguably most {{difficult}} type of dinghy to sail. A skiff has a flat narrow hull with a disproportionately large sailplan, usually consisting of an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnaker,</b> blade jib and fully battened main. Sailors manage the rig {{with the use}} of racks (wings) and trapeze. [...] Examples are the 49er, an Olympic boat, 18 Footers (see below) and the advanced International 14.|$|E

50|$|The Formula 16 (F16) sport {{catamaran}} is an ISAF recognised 5 m {{long beach}} catamaran with an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnaker</b> setup.|$|E
50|$|Many sportsboat designs feature <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnakers</b> and, like skiffs, {{they are}} often sailed {{downwind}} by sailing a series of broad reaches in a shallower zig-zag pattern than with traditional symmetrical spinnakers.|$|R
50|$|IRC {{can apply}} a rating to any mono-hull yacht. It {{considers}} such features as <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnakers,</b> carbon masts, canting keels, and water ballast, {{all of which}} have been permitted for several years. Furthermore, the rule is reviewed annually in light of new developments and past results. On this front, RORC seeks and actively welcome input and comment from the users.|$|R
50|$|The {{boats are}} {{equipped}} with <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnakers,</b> {{and as a result}} they require a skilled and physically fit crew to be competitive. However, many crews also use this catamaran for purely recreational sailing. The relatively high platform weights lead to robust construction and limit the benefits from fragile advanced construction techniques, keeping costs down and increasing longevity. The level and popularity of the class draw former Olympic Tornado sailors to it.|$|R
5000|$|ISO is {{a former}} International Sailing Federation (ISAF) class of two-person sailing dinghy with a single trapeze and an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnaker.</b> The ISO was {{designed}} in 1993 by Ian Howlett and John Caig and manufactured by Reg White Limited of Brightlingsea {{as part of the}} [...] "White Formula" [...] range of boats originally marketed by Topper International Ltd and since 2013 by Vantage Sailing Ltd. The boat has a fully battened mainsail, jib and an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnaker.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Skate {{is a high}} {{performance}} two-person racing dinghy unique to Australia. Designed as a monohull sailboat it's fourteen feet long (4.27m) with a 7.2m mast, 1.8m bow pole and masthead <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnaker.</b> It is an Australian national class.|$|E
50|$|The RS400 is a {{light-weight}} {{sailing dinghy}} designed by Phil Morrison and manufactured by RS Sailing. The dinghy is sailed by 2 people {{and has a}} main, a jib and an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnaker.</b> It has a PY of 948 and a D-PN of 82.3.|$|E
50|$|To this day, the ‘hard chine’ Punt is a {{favourite}} of many, {{possibly because}} of its exceptional performance in light to medium conditions, and is still as much in production as ever; of the nine Punts built since 2000, four have been to this design. However, once again owners’ preferences have caused rig configurations vary, from aluminium to carbon spars, single or twin trapezes and symmetric or <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnakers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Although {{outside class}} rules {{and unable to}} be used in class {{competition}} (i.e. National Titles) recent years have seen <b>Asymmetric</b> <b>Spinnakers</b> or 'Kites' added to the Stingray for increased downwind performance. Two of the Kite enabled Stingrays were set up in South Australia by members of the Victor Harbor Yacht Club. Despite speculation that the rig would not be able sustain the high loads inflicted by the Kite The Shadow (#582) now based in VIC is yet to have any serious malfunction, and the manufacturer of the [...] "Superwing" [...] mast feels the mast is strong enough.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} {{categories}} of <b>spinnakers,</b> symmetric and <b>asymmetric</b> depending on whether a plane of symmetry exists for that particular sail. <b>Asymmetric</b> <b>spinnakers</b> operate more like a jib, generating lift from the side, rather than the top like a symmetric spinnaker. This makes asymmetrics a better choice on reaching courses than symmetric spinnakers, which excel when running. While a fully equipped racing boat might {{have a number of}} spinnakers, both symmetric and asymmetric, to cover all courses and wind conditions, cruising boats almost always use an asymmetric, due to the broader application and easier handling afforded by the asymmetric.|$|R
50|$|A {{cruising}} chute {{is a form}} of <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnaker</b> used by cruising yachts {{and designed}} for easy use when short handed. Two sheets are used, with the tack line eased by a foot or so before gybing. Alternatively only one sheet is used, with the sail snuffed before a gybe.|$|E
50|$|The RS200 utilises {{a single}} line <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnaker</b> system and low sheet loads on the sail controls. It can be sailed by weights of between 16 and 26 stone. The open transom allows the RS200 to {{virtually}} self drain after a capsize and a moulded self bailer removes any remaining water.|$|E
50|$|Contemporary boats weigh {{as little}} as 165 lb, and have as typical {{equipment}} a retractable spinnaker pole, unlimited <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnaker</b> size, 200sq ft mainsail and jib area, a fully battened mainsail, an adjustable carbon rig, and a hydrofoil rudder that allows the boat to be trimmed fore and aft for different conditions, and as a drag reduction device.|$|E
50|$|Designs from Fabian Bush, David Horne and Stephen Jones {{broadened the}} {{spectrum}} and {{appeal of the}} class, with hull lengths from 19 to 22 ft and construction materials as diverse as possible - sheet ply, clinker planks, cold moulded wood, fibreglass, carbon and Kevlar are all to be found throughout the development fleet, and as with the “hard chine” fleet, rig configurations vary, from aluminium to carbon spars, single or twin trapezes and symmetric or <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnakers.</b> These “Progress” designs have traveled the length and breadth of the UK to compete {{in some of the}} bigger one-off handicap regattas such as the Grafham Grand Prix, the Bloody Mary, etc., {{and as long as the}} conditions are appropriate (i.e. no waves!), the boats and the sailors will, and do, acquit themselves favourably against the mainstream competition.|$|R
40|$|Combines on-water sail {{pressure}} and shape measurements to determine forces  International collaboration involving researchers in France and New Zealand  First published results of such measurements on <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnakers</b>  Accuracy of the shape predictions from the highly curved sails {{is shown to}} be good  Results give fine details of the pressure distributions along the height and chord  Full-scale results from measurements on both a Stewart 34 and a J 80 An innovative method combining simultaneous on-water {{pressure and}} sail shape measurements for determining aerodynamic forces produced by sails is described and used on Stewart 34 and J 80 Class yachts flying <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnakers.</b> Data were recorded in light and medium winds in order to check the reliability, accuracy and repeatability of the system. Results showed similar trends to the published literature. The accuracy of the system was investigated by wind tunnel tests, with determination of the entire sail shape from the stripe images recorded by the camera-based (VSPARS) system, and {{was found to be}} relatively good. Generally the pressure distributions show a leading edge suction peak, occurring at 5 to 10 % of the chord length, followed by a pressure recovery and then a suction increase due to the sail curvature, with finally a reduction in suction near the trailing edge. The drive force coefficient measured on the Stewart 34 is lower than for the J 80 because of a non-optimal sail shape due to light winds. On a reaching course, the standard deviation of the pressure signals was largest near the luff, reducing in the stream-wise direction, while it was high on the entire sail section when sailing on a running course. This project has received funding from the European Union’s Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement No PIRSES-GA- 2012 - 318924, and from the Royal Society of New Zealand for the UK-France-NZ collaboration project SAILING FLUIDS...|$|R
5000|$|The {{light weight}} mast and mast bend can be {{controlled}} using a deck level screw and adjustable spreaders. Rake and sideways bend are further variable via the jib halyard. Both the main and jib are fully battened. The <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnaker</b> has an extending/retractable bowsprit that can be biased/offset/"rocked" [...] to windward, allowing the RS400 to sail deeper angles offwind/downwind.|$|E
5000|$|The RS100, first {{launched}} in 2009 by RS Sailing, is a singlehanded skiff. [...] Possessing an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnaker</b> [...] the boat has two PY numbers of 992 for the 10.2 rig and 1000 for the 8.4 rig.. The RS100 has a racing event circuit in the United Kingdom and in Europe, with the Eurotour beginning in 2011.|$|E
5000|$|Current Cherubs use an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnaker</b> {{system but}} earlier boats used {{relatively}} large double luff spinnakers {{and used a}} notably long (9 foot) spinnaker pole. Cherubs have a high power-to-weight ratio and are very quick downwind in stronger breezes but can be slow upwind in lighter airs compared to longer boats. The Cherub has a RYA Portsmouth number of 930.|$|E
5000|$|Bethwaite and Jen Glass {{have also}} {{designed}} the 29erXX, a twin trapeze derivative of the 29er. It {{uses the same}} hull with some minor changes such as an extended gunwale and a rudder gantry, with a larger rig that includes a square-top main and masthead <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnaker.</b> The class became an International Sailing Federation recognised class {{in its own right}} in 2010.|$|E
50|$|The 59er dinghy was {{put into}} {{production}} in Australia and the UK in 2002. The 59er is a non-trapeze, 4.7m (15 feet 5 inches) sailing dinghy, rigged with an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnaker.</b> It is designed for a crew weight of 145 kg to 180 kg (320 lb to 400 lb). Performance expectations are that it {{be similar to the}} 49er/29er model.|$|E

5000|$|It was {{originally}} developed in 1963 at Manly Sailing Club in Sydney as the Manly Graduate 14ft {{to be used}} as a stepping stone between the smaller Manly Junior and larger boats such as the 16ft Skiff. During its early history it had a double luff spinnaker, but is now rigged with an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnaker</b> - giving great performance, ease of use and tactical gybing downwind.|$|E
50|$|The RS Vareo is a modern, single-handed {{sailing dinghy}} raced {{throughout}} the UK at both club and national level. The RS Vareo is a hiking singlehander with an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnaker.</b> Fleets have grown throughout the UK and a racing circuit {{has been developed}} by the RS Association with sponsored events & championships. The GUL RS Vareo National Championships saw a record fleet of 47 competing at Netley SC in July 2007.|$|E
50|$|The 505 has a {{track record}} for {{adopting}} technological advances in the sport, keeping the class current and relevant but without rendering existing boats obsolete. Experimental modifications to the accepted design, i.e. outside of the class rules, have been conducted {{at different points in}} history. Such modifications have included setting up a double-trapeze system, installation of a bowsprit, and inclusion of an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnaker.</b> To date these have not been adopted by the 505 Class Association.|$|E
50|$|The Wayfarer World was {{introduced}} in 1997 and {{was designed as a}} collaboration between Ian Proctor and his son Keith. Made in GRP with no woodwork it has a removable aft storage tank, a self draining cockpit, and a spinnaker chute. The rudder stock is of aluminium alloy. Until the MkIV this was the only version with an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnaker,</b> although it can not be used in class races in the UK. It has proved successful in both racing and cruising, including a North Sea crossing 1998.|$|E
5000|$|The RS700 is {{regarded}} by many professionals, including German Contender champion Christian Brandt, as the fastest and most user friendly skiff around, the magazine Yachts & Yachting {{has referred to}} it as being [...] "simple but highly effective", the magazine also commented on the ease with which the spinnaker can be raised and lowered. The RS700 has a trapeze, mainsail and an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnaker,</b> but no jib. The width of the wings on the RS700 are adjustable, meaning that the boat can be sailed by different sized sailors.|$|E
5000|$|The Buzz is a {{sailing dinghy}} {{designed}} in 1994 by Ian Howlett and manufactured by Reg White Limited of Brightlingsea {{as part of}} the [...] "White Formula" [...] range of boats originally marketed by Topper International Ltd but since 2013 by Vantage Sailing. The Buzz is a double handed racing boat, with a single trapeze for the crewman. The boat has a fully battened mainsail, furling jib and an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnaker.</b> There have been around 500 boats built. The Buzz is designed to be an easy to sail boat, {{but it can also be}} raced competitively.|$|E
5000|$|The Laser Vortex {{is a high}} {{performance}} sailing dinghy designed by Jo Richards and awarded the [...] "Sailboat of the Year" [...] title on its introduction in 2000. It is a tunnel hulled single hander that has a trapeze and an optional <b>Asymmetric</b> <b>spinnaker.</b> It is manufactured by White Formula UK Ltd under licence from a consortium headed up by Jonathan Carter. Jo Richard remains {{the owner of the}} design. Laser Performance are no longer involved with the Vortex. In 2013 {{the decision was made to}} drop 'Laser' from the name, the boat is now known only as the Vortex.|$|E
5000|$|International Canoes are raced {{in three}} divisions. The {{main body of}} the class competes to a {{development}} (or [...] "box") rule, allowing for significant variation in design between different boats within the rule framework.Within that rule there is a [...] "One Design" [...] subclass which covers boats built to a one design rule in operation between 1971 and 2007, all of which have the same hull shape and are subject to an 83 kg minimum weight limit.The third division, known as the AC (Asymmetric Canoe), uses the 83 kg one design hull and carries an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnaker.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 4000 is a fast, planing skiff-style dinghy with a trapeze for {{the crew}} and trampolines for the helm. Upwind, the boat does not point {{especially}} close to the wind, but its fully battened sails give enough power {{to keep up with}} similar-sized boats. Downwind, however is where the boat excels due to its <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnaker</b> (a.k.a. gennaker). In a force 3 the 4000 will plane and the crew will make full use of the trapeze wire. However, force 4-5 is when the boat performs its optimum. The 4000 is fast enough {{to make use of the}} apparent wind to reach the bottom of the racecourse sooner.|$|E
50|$|The Laser 3000 is {{a racing}} sailing dinghy crewed by two persons with a trapeze for the crew. Launched in 1996, the 3000 was {{developed}} from the Laser 2, using the original Frank Bethwaite-designed planing hull combined with a brand new self-draining deck by Derek Clark. Clark also re-designed the rig, using spars and sails from premium proprietary sources and replacing the symmetric spinnaker of the Laser 2 by a larger <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnaker</b> (gennaker). The gennaker is chute-launched and retrieved using a single halyard line, and is set on a retractable bowsprit. Helm balance and handling were improved using a shorter-footed mainsail with two full-width battens giving a larger roach. A mast with conventional spreaders replaced the now-unusual diamond arrangement of the Laser 2.|$|E

50|$|Since the 1960s many faster sailing craft, {{starting}} with catamaran classes, {{had discovered that}} it is faster to sail downwind {{on a series of}} broad reaches with efficient airflow across the sail rather than directly downwind with the sails stalled. This technique had developed to the extent that in bar conversation {{at the end of one}} season Andrew Buckland observed that the 18s had sailed all season without pulling the spinnaker pole back from the forestay and that all the systems could be simplified by eliminating the pole and setting the spinnaker from a fixed (but often retractable) bowsprit. The concept quickly evolved to a sail with a loose luff much more like a conventional spinnaker than the old jib style asymmetric sails. Julian Bethwaite was the first to rig and sail a boat with one the next season, followed shortly by Andrew Buckland. The first modern offshore sailboats to incorporate a retractable bow sprit and an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnaker</b> was the J/Boats J/105.|$|E
5000|$|The Laser 2 is a {{double-handed}} {{version of}} the popular Laser one-design class of small sailing dinghy. It is a quick, planing dinghy that differs from the Laser in {{that it has a}} jib, symmetric spinnaker and a trapeze for the crew. It was designed by New Zealander Frank Bethwaite and was first launched as a product in Australia then North America in 1979 and in Europe in 1980. The hull is made of GRP (glass reinforced plastic). The rig is a Bermudian rig sloop with spinnaker. It is designed to be a mid to high performance racer. In Britain, its most common current use is at university class in British University Sailing Association (BUSA) events. A version known as the Laser Fun was available, the same hull but featuring a reefable mainsail and a roller furling jib, and with the option of an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>spinnaker</b> (Laser Fun New Wave). As a strict one-design boat the Laser 2 was not available for amateur construction.|$|E
