5000|$|The Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali {{schools of}} Sunni Islam have {{maintained}} that only Quranic verses revealed later can <b>abrogate</b> <b>an</b> earlier Quranic verse, but a Sunnah from a Hadith can never <b>abrogate</b> <b>a</b> Quranic verse. In contrast, the Hanafi fiqh of Sunni Islam, {{from the days}} of Abu Hanifa, along with his disciples such as Abu Yusuf, maintained that Sunnah can <b>abrogate</b> <b>a</b> Quranic verse. The Hanafi jurists used Quranic verse 10:15 to justify their opinion, stating that abrogation of the Qur’an by the life actions of Muhammad (Sunnah) was based solely on his Divine inspiration, that when he acted or said anything, any abrogation implicit through his action, of the earlier Qur’anic ruling was from Allah alone, according to Yusuf Suicmez. Hanafi school stated, adds Suicmez, that to accept that [...] "a Sunnah can abrogate the Qur’an entails honoring of Muhammad ( [...] S.A.W)".|$|R
