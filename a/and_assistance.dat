5|$|Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold {{starting}} in the 1880s, and the Republican governments provided jobs <b>and</b> <b>assistance</b> for the new immigrants {{in return for their}} votes.

The Democratic victory of 1932 meant an end to Republican patronage jobs <b>and</b> <b>assistance.</b> As the Depression worsened, Pittsburgh ethnics voted heavily for the Democrats, especially in 1934, making the city a stronghold of the New Deal Coalition. By 1936, Democratic programs for relief and jobs, especially the WPA, were so popular with the ethnics that a large majority voted for the Democrats.|$|E
