One {{of the most recent}} developments in technology enhanced method in teaching and learning is a method called flipped learning. It is an approach where the traditional one-way lecture is flipped to make room for active learning opportunities where educators shift learning into the individual learning space facilitated by technology. This study attempts to implement flipped learning approach in the effort to enhance communication and critical thinking skills among accounting students in Tunku Puteri Intan Safinaz School of Accounting (TISSA) in Universiti Utara Malaysia. The study involved 49 students from BKAL 1013 Business <b>Accounting</b> <b>Group</b> O class from the first semester of 2016 / 2017.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine {{accounting}} students' experience of compulsory group work. The paper hypothesises that a student-centered style of teaching-involving activities, like case studies and group-based learning encourages students to take a deeper approach to learning. The paper also sought students' suggestions to improve learning in a group environment and to identify areas for future research. Design/methodology/approach – There is a paucity of research that examines the relationships between group work and the adoption of a deep learning approach. This research uses empirical data in the form of a questionnaire with open and closed response options. This paper uses a qualitative method, phenomenography, to analyse the responses of 362 students. Findings – The findings reveal variations in conceptions of group work among students with evidence of both surface and deep approaches to learning. Research limitations/implications – The following limitations are recognised: the questionnaire may not have given students an opportunity to express their perceptions fully; the absence of demographic data did not permit consideration of cultural factors on the outcome and the analysis was able to focus only on perceptions of behaviour rather than actual behaviour. A major implication from the paper is the value of research into accounting education. The paper provides the opportunity to trial research, reflect upon and change curricula, delivery and assessment based on research findings. Originality/value – Student experiences in group work in accounting, while not entirely new, is however, an area not widely reported on. <b>Accounting,</b> <b>Group</b> work, Phenomenography, Students...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{development}} {{towards an}} {{international accounting standard}} implies that Swedish groups of companies that are not quoted on the stock exchange can use a parent company perspective or an entity perspective while making their group accounting. The {{purpose of this study}} is to describe and explain the motives behind the groups of companies choice of perspective and to show how these motives agrees with the effect it has on the profit and loss account and on the balance sheet. The study includes four fictitious groups of companies based on real groups of companies. Every group of companies includes 1 - 3 subsidiary companies, where at least one is owned by the parent company with 51 - 70 %. Some assumptions were made before the consolidation. Relevant key numbers have been calculated according to both perspectives and then compared. A total of three semi structured interviews have been carried out two with representatives for the real groups of companies and one with a chartered accountant. The purpose was to clarify the motives that are behind the choice of perspective. The conclusion is that the choice of perspective is not an active choice for the group of companies in the study, there are therefore no active motives. The entity perspective provides better results on two out of the three examined key numbers, but the difference is only marginal. The change of perspective is a problem in theory but not in reality.

40|$|Despite {{its surface}} {{appearance}} of precision, {{the establishment of}} accounting principles is an ongoing political process. This is because they affect different factions of the constituency in different ways. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) was structured so as to minimize potential undue influence by lobbyists. But is this independence illusory?^ The present study replicates and extends prior work done by Brown (1981). 2 ̆ 2 Influence attempts 2 ̆ 2 was operationalized as comment letters written to nine FASB Discussion Memos (DMs). Two subsets of policy questions comprised the cues. ^ Letter writers were stratified into two subsamples. The 2 ̆ 2 <b>accounting</b> <b>group</b> 2 ̆ 2 contained the Big-Eight CPA firms plus five professional reporting societies. 2 ̆ 2 Special-interest subjects 2 ̆ 2 were drawn from Fortune- 500 and specialized sampling frames. ^ Subjects 2 ̆ 7 positions on each policy issue were obtained from their comment letters. The FASB 2 ̆ 7 s corresponding rulings were drawn from its Official Pronouncements. ^ A multidimensional scaling (MDS) was performed on each issue subset. Clusters of respondents holding similar positions were identified. A number of issues were discernible as dimensions in the perceptual spaces. ^ Several overall follow-up tests were performed. A Mann-Whitney U test {{was performed on the}} pairwise relative distances to the FASB. This was done for the accounting vs. special-interest subjects, and for Brown 2 ̆ 7 s vs. the additional policy issues. ^ There was no overall difference in average FASB alignment between accounting and non-accounting subjects. However, a marginal difference was evident between the two sets of policy issues. As a result, the Mann-Whitney U was rerun within each DM, with 2 ̆ 2 issue subset 2 ̆ 2 as a blocking factor. FASB alignment was closer to the accounting subjects for five sets, and to special-interest subjects for two sets. ...|$|E

40|$|Legacies of the Global Financial Crisis {{and major}} {{domestic}} corporate collapses – such as HIH Insurance Pty Ltd and One. Tel Ltd (telecommunications) – have significantly changed Australia‟s financial regulatory landscape. Legal requirements for auditors have attracted particular attention as have practice standards more broadly around disclosure and conflict of interest. Conversely, although successful detection and prosecution of breaches may rest in significant part on forensic accounting activities, Australia‟s practitioners {{in this field}} have no minimum training or qualifications standards other than the baseline requirements mandated by the country‟s three professional accounting bodies. For those unaffiliated with these organizations, no professional oversight exists. In Australia, growth in the forensic accounting industry has been in direct response to public demand for expertise in {{a broad range of}} fraud, forensic and business analytics areas in order to improve the corporate governance practices of Australian organizations. During the 1990 s, Australian forensic accounting firms expanded and diversified into a number of different areas going well beyond just the examination of financial documents and involvement in financial litigation disputes. “Big 4 ” accounting firms such as PriceWaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, Deloitte and Ernst and Young formed independent forensic accounting or forensic services units; a number of mid-tier and „boutique‟ forensic accounting firms similarly expanded into forensic investigative, analytical and advisory services. By 2008, 800 forensic accountants were registered with the country‟s largest specialist forensic <b>accounting</b> <b>group,</b> the Forensic Accounting Special Interest Group (FASIG) of the ICAA 1. Currently, obtaining more precise figures on numbers of forensic accounting practitioners is problematic: professional accounting bodies either do not keep a register or have ceased registering their forensic accounting members; lack of formal recognition, admission or certification processes complicate identification of candidates; and diversity of the skills sets the industry requires has meant the influx of non-accounting based specialists...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{dependence}} on worked examples in accounting education and training, {{little research has}} been conducted regarding the use of context in accounting settings. The influence of company specifics and variability of industry context in worked examples on performance on a novel problem is investigated using a Cognitive Load framework. Further, the effect of two types of instructional interventions on performance is examined. It was predicted that participants would perform best on novel problems when the study examples are in different industries and contained little company-specific contextual information. When participants were asked to engage in self-explanation or analogical encoding, those who received the study examples with little company context were expected to perform better than those who received study examples with rich company context. Further, because the analogical encoding intervention was expected to invoke deeper and more abstract processing than the self-explanation intervention, performance in the analogical encoding condition was expected to be better than in the self-explanation condition. ^ None of the hypotheses regarding performance differences among conditions were supported in either experiment. Additional analyses were conducted that considered example order and in Experiment 1, participants receiving the longer example first reported they expended significantly more effort on the study materials and concepts than those who had the shorter example first. A similar effect was found in experiment 2, but only for the introductory accounting students; those participants who received the easier example first performed significantly better on the novel problem than those who received the harder example first. The order effect was not present in the more advanced participants. However, unlike the introductory participants, those in the advanced <b>accounting</b> <b>group</b> were influenced by company-specific context; those in the company-rich condition performed significantly higher than those in the company-sparse condition. ^ Participants in the self-explain condition reported expending the greatest amount of effort. Those in the analogical encoding condition reported experiencing the least understanding of the materials. Overall, participants in both experiments 1 and 2 were poor judges of their understanding of both the study materials and their ability to solve the novel problem. ...|$|E
