The two co-stars {{developed}} a romantic relationship, {{and during the}} shooting schedule of Jeevan Naiya, Devika eloped with Hassan. Himanshu was both enraged and distraught. Since the leading pair were absent, production was stalled. A {{significant portion of the}} movie had been shot and a large sum of money, which had been taken as credit from financers, had been spent. The studio therefore suffered severe financial losses <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> of credit among bankers in the city while the runaway couple made merry.|$|E
5|$|On 23 September 2010, an {{incident}} occurred in Queen Mary 2s aft harmonic filter room.

Though picked in a preseason poll to win the Coastal Division of the ACC, the Hokies were upset in their season opener by East Carolina University.|$|E

5|$|After {{defeating}} Young Battling Nelson again, in {{a rematch}} set in Binghamton, Dyer lost on points {{a week later}} to Wisconsin fighter Pal Reed. He continued to appear at charity contests in the early half of 1919, mainly for the Boxers' Loyalty League, sparring {{with the likes of}} Tim Healy and Silas Green. By now Dyer's vaudeville bookings were far outnumbering his boxing appearances and {{in the latter half of}} 1919 he faced only a handful of opponents in paid boxing matches. These included a newspaper decision loss to Steve Latzo in May and a win over Johnny Evans in New Jersey in July. Between August and September Dyer was part of a touring boxing show organised by the Knights of Columbus, fighting for the entertainment of returned and injured soldiers. Dyer fought a few more professional bouts in America, a draw <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> to Joe Egan and a newspaper decision win over Jimmy Gray, but by 1920 Dyer had left the country and had returned to Europe.|$|E
5|$|Another {{season with}} many more losses than wins {{occurred}} in 2010. The season {{started with a}} 32–17 loss to the Crusaders, followed by a narrow 15–19 loss to the Blues. The first season came next with a 31–24 win over the Cheetahs in South Africa. The South African trip ended with two losses though; a 33–0 defeat by the Stormers, and a high scoring loss to the Bulls. They eventually achieved their second win of the season over the Lions in round seven. Losses to the Chiefs and Western Force {{was followed by a}} narrow two-point loss to the Hurricanes. Next was their third win of the season; this time over the Waratahs in Invercargill.

5|$|At {{the time}} of the line's planning, Downtown Flushing was a quiet Dutch-colonial-style village; what is now Roosevelt Avenue in the area was known as Amity Street, a major {{commercial}} thoroughfare in the neighborhood. In late 1912, Flushing community groups were petitioning the Public Service Commission (PSC) to depress the proposed line in Flushing into a subway tunnel, rather than an elevated line. Unlike a subway, an el would cause disturbances to the quality of life <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> in nearby property values, as well as a widening of Amity Street that would cause more changes to the already existing town. One Amity Street property owner compared the planned effect of an elevated Flushing Line on Amity Street to the degradation of Myrtle Avenue in Brooklyn after the Myrtle Avenue Elevated was built there. On the other hand, a subway would only require that the street be widened, even though it was more expensive than an elevated of the same length.|$|E
5|$|By the 1880s {{there was}} {{increasing}} pressure {{to reform the}} structure of English counties {{and the question of}} county government had become a major political issue. Both the Liberal and Conservative party manifestos for the 1886 general election contained promises to introduce elected local authorities. The Local Government (Boundaries) Act 1887 received Royal Assent in September 1887 and appointed Boundary Commissioners to review the existing county boundaries, except for the 'Counties Corporate'. Worcestershire would have witnessed the formation of a county administration <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> of territory to Birmingham. The Act also legislated for Dudley to unite {{with the rest of the}} county, although this would be achieved through a transfer of territory from Staffordshire. This Act was repealed in favour of the alternative Local Government Act 1888.|$|E
5|$|During {{the third}} inning of a 2007 game at Fenway Park, Manny Ramírez, J. D. Drew, Mike Lowell, and Jason Varitek hit four {{consecutive}} home runs off Yankee pitcher Chase Wright, powering a comeback from a three-run deficit and completing a three-game sweep of the Yankees at Fenway Park {{for the first time}} since 1990. By May, after long speculation about what team he would play for after retirement, Roger Clemens chose to return to the Yankees as opposed to the Red Sox (where he started his career) or the Houston Astros (his hometown and last team he played for). Clemens helped the Yankees overcome a 14-game deficit in the standings to roar back to reach the playoffs again, however, this was not enough to win the division. On September 28, Boston won the AL East after a win against the Minnesota Twins <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> by the Yankees against the Baltimore Orioles. This was the first AL East Championship for the Red Sox since 1995, ending the Yankees' nine-year reign in the division.|$|E

In intrastate play, the Farmers recorded wins over Johns Hopkins, St. John's, and Washington College, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> to Western Maryland. Once again, the team secured the state championship.
