5|$|By 1911, {{the owner}} Major Richard Winstanley {{was unable to}} pay for the upkeep of the castle <b>and,</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> its deteriorating condition, {{proposed}} placing the property into the guardianship of the Commissioners of Works. Following a survey by the architect Sir Frank Baines, which showed the ruins to need immediate repairs, the Commissioners took over the castle the following year. It was restored by Sir Charles Peers, the Inspector of Ancient Monuments, between 1912 and 1913. He stripped away any remains of the farm, cleared the vegetation from the walls and repaired the brickwork, re-cutting the moat and reconstructing a replica of the medieval bridge.|$|E

25|$|While some leading surplus {{countries}} including China {{have been}} taking steps to boost domestic demand, these {{have not yet been}} sufficient to rebalance out of their current account surpluses.

25|$|In the novel, Jack's {{authority}} {{issues are}} {{triggered by the}} fact that his interviewer, Ullman, is highly authoritarian, a kind of snobbish martinet.

Only in the novel does Ullman state that he disapproves of hiring Jack but higher authorities have asked that Jack be hired. Ullman's bossy nature in the novel {{is one of the first}} steps in Jack's deterioration, whereas in the film, Ullman serves largely as an expositor.|$|E
25|$|The {{surviving}} French forces {{retreated from}} the Convention Redoubt and across a ravine to the defences around the Torra di Fornali, which had driven off Linzee's squadron in September 1793. A strong position so far undamaged by the bombardment, the British {{were concerned that}} it would cause heavy casualties to an attacking force, but the retreating French were panicked <b>and</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> being cut off, so that during the night the tower and batteries were abandoned, the French soldiers falling back to San Fiorenzo, accompanied by the frigates.|$|E

This time, augmented with increased military equipment and additional troops, <b>and</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> defense of the approaches to India, British authorities sided with Stilwell.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century the British and Russian Empires were competing for supremacy in Central Asia. Unable to establish diplomatic contacts with the Tibetan government, <b>and</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> reports of their dealings with Russia, in 1903-04, a British expedition led by Colonel Francis Younghusband was sent to Lhasa to force a trading agreement and to prevent Tibetans from establishing a relationship with the Russians. In response, the Qing foreign ministry asserted that China was sovereign over Tibet, the first clear statement of such a claim. Before the British troops arrived in Lhasa, the 13th Dalai Lama fled to Outer Mongolia, and then went to Beijing in 1908.|$|E
25|$|Veteran CCPD detective Paul Rivera led {{the murder}} investigation. Originally, an unnamed man {{was hired to}} defend Saldívar but withdrew from the case on April 4 fearing {{community}} retaliation, <b>and</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> his children's reaction when they learned he was defending Saldívar whom they disliked. Judge Mike Westergren began searching for a defense attorney. Prosecutor Carlos Valdez was designated lead prosecutor, while Mark Skurka was appointed his legal counsel. On April 6, a grand jury was called to determine whether to indict Saldívar for murder. After about an hour, the jury had returned a true bill and the indictment was randomly assigned to the 214th District Court. Carlos Valdez believed that a speedy trial with Westergren presiding over the case was probable.|$|E

25|$|Thailand has {{observed}} global patterns of an enlarging elderly class: as fertility control is encouraged and medical advances are made, births shrink and lives age. The Thai government is noticing <b>and</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> this trend, but tends to let families {{care for their}} elderly members rather than create extraneous policies for them. As of 2011, there are only 25 state sponsored homes for the elderly, {{with no more than}} a few thousand members of each home. Such programs are largely run by volunteers and are questionable by quality of care, considering there is not always a guarantee care will be available. Private care is tough to follow, often based on assumptions. Because children are less likely to care for their parents, private caretakers are in demand. Volunteer NGOs are available but in very limited quantities.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} World War II, Aspasia {{decided not}} to go back to Greece and she {{returned}} to Venice, to live once more on the Island of Giudecca. Back in the Garden of Eden, she found her house partially destroyed by the conflict and began to rebuild. Still without sufficient financial resources <b>and</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the situation of her daughter (who granted her at one point the guardianship of her grandson Crown Prince Alexander,), Aspasia led a quiet life, punctuated by a few public appearances during cultural events. Over the years, her financial situation deteriorated even further, and during the winter of 1959–1960, the Princess was no longer able to pay the heating bills. She temporarily left the Garden of Eden and stayed in the hotels Europa and Britannia in Venice. Shortly after, she was forced to sell some furniture and other valuables to pay off her debts.|$|E
25|$|The British {{reason for}} the war was, in {{addition}} to expanding British Bengal's sphere of influence, the desire for new markets for British manufacturing. The British were also anxious to deny the French the use of Burmese harbours <b>and</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> French influence at the Court of Ava, as the kingdom was still known to them. British Ambassador Michael Symes's mission was equipped to gain as much knowledge as possible {{of the country for}} future British plans whereas previous envoys were concerned principally with trade concessions. Anglo–French rivalry had already played a role during Alaungpaya's endeavours of unifying the kingdom. The Burmese in these wars were advancing into smaller states not ruled by the British or the subject of expansionary goals by the British before the war began, and the British were not so much preoccupied by the refugee problem initially as by the threat posed by the French until further incidents forced their hand.|$|E

25|$|On July 5, Coleman and Brown {{arrived in}} Toledo, Ohio, where Coleman befriended Virginia Temple, {{the mother of}} several children.

Temple and her eldest child, 9-year-old Rachelle, had been strangled to death, and their bodies were discovered in a crawl space. The same morning as the murders of Virginia Temple and her daughter, Coleman and Brown entered the home of Frank and Dorothy Duvendack in Toledo, where Coleman bound the couple with appliance and phone cords which had been cut, taking money and their car. One of Mrs. Duvendack's watches was stolen, and later found under another victim. Later that same day, Coleman and Brown visited the Dayton, Ohio home of Reverend Millard Gay and his wife Kathryn. The two stayed with the Gays and accompanied them to a religious service on July 9, where {{the next day the}} Gays dropped off Coleman and Brown in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio.|$|E
25|$|Facing {{increasing}} demand for electricity <b>and</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the low reserve situation, {{the government of}} Israel began taking steps to increase the supply of electricity and operating reserve, as well to reduce the monopoly position of the IEC and increase competition in the electricity market starting in {{second half of the}} 2000s decade. It instructed the IEC to construct several new power stations and encouraged private investment in the generation sector. By 2015, the IEC's share of total nationwide installed electric generation capacity had fallen to about 75%, with the company then possessing an installed generation capacity of about 13.6 gigawatts (GW). Since 2010, Independent Power Producers have constructed three new gas-fired combined cycle power stations with a total generation capacity of about 2.2 GW, while various industrial concerns constructed on-premises cogeneration facilities with a total electricity output of about 1 GW, and which are licensed by the electric authority to sell surplus electricity to the national grid at competitive rates. Also under construction is a 300 MW pumped storage facility, with two more in planning, plus several solar-powered plants.|$|E
25|$|The Salinas {{prepare to}} attend a ball, {{one of the most}} {{important}} of the Palermo social season. The Prince is both excited <b>and</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the evening to come. It will be the first time Angelica and her beauty are to be presented to the public. However, he remains concerned that Don Calogero will make a complete fool of both himself and the Salinas. When Angelica (looking beautiful) and Don Calogero (looking acceptable) arrive shortly after, Angelica, thanks to detailed training in etiquette given to her by Tancredi, makes a huge social success. The Prince, after being satisfied that Angelica has been accepted, wanders through the rooms of the Palazzo Ponteleone where the ball is being held, becoming increasingly gloomy at the callowness of the young men, the boredom in the older men, and the silliness of the girls. The Prince notices Tancredi and Angelica dancing happily together, oblivious to the other's desperation, ambition, and greed. As he watches, the Prince comes to realize and accept, if only for a moment, that whatever happiness the lovers feel is to be celebrated, no matter what.|$|E
