40|$|In this paper, the {{contribution}} of visual and <b>acoustic</b> <b>preference</b> to multi-sensory landscape evaluation was quantitatively compared. The real landscapes were treated as dual-sensory ambiance and separated into visual landscape and soundscape. Both were evaluated by 63 respondents in laboratory conditions. The analysis {{of the relationship between}} respondent's visual and <b>acoustic</b> <b>preference</b> as well as their respective contribution to landscape preference showed that (1) some common attributes are universally identified in assessing visual, aural and audio-visual preference, such as naturalness or degree of human disturbance; (2) with acoustic and visual preferences as variables, a multi-variate linear regression model can satisfactorily predict landscape preference (R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 740), while the coefficients of determination for a unitary linear regression model were 0. 345 and 0. 720 for visual and <b>acoustic</b> <b>preference</b> as predicting factors, respectively; (3) <b>acoustic</b> <b>preference</b> played a much more important role in landscape evaluation than visual preference in this study (the former is about 4. 5 times of the latter), which strongly suggests a rethinking of the role of soundscape in environment perception research and landscape planning practice...|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{coupling}} {{hypothesis of}} signal-preference evolution, whereby the same genes control male signal and female preference for that signal, was first {{inspired by the}} evolution of cricket acoustic communication nearly 50 years ago. To examine this hypothesis, we compared the genomic location of quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying male song and female <b>acoustic</b> <b>preference</b> variation in the Hawaiian cricket genus Laupala. We document a QTL underlying female <b>acoustic</b> <b>preference</b> variation between 2 closely related species (Laupala kohalensis and Laupala paranigra). This preference QTL colocalizes with a song QTL identified previously, providing compelling evidence for a genomic linkage of the genes underlying these traits. We show that both song and preference QTL make small to moderate contributions to the behavioral difference between species, suggesting that divergence in mating behavior among Laupala species {{is due to the}} fixation of many genes of minor effect. The diversity of acoustic signaling systems in crickets exemplifies the evolution of elaborate male displays by sexual selection through female choice. Our data reveal genetic conditions that would enable functional coordination between song and <b>acoustic</b> <b>preference</b> divergence during speciation, resulting in a behaviorally coupled mode of signal-preference evolution. Interestingly, Laupala exhibits one of the fastest rates of speciation in animals, concomitant with equally rapid evolution in sexual signaling behaviors. Genomic linkage may facilitate rapid speciation by contributing to genetic correlations between sexual signaling behaviors that eventually cause sexual isolation between diverging populations...|$|E
40|$|Mating {{signals that}} {{increase}} attractiveness of males to females can also increase conspicuousness of the signaler to predators and parasites. We investigated the <b>acoustic</b> <b>preference</b> of species of blood-sucking flies {{of the genus}} Corethrella (Diptera: Corethrellidae), which eavesdrop on the sexual advertisement signals of t�ngara frogs (Physalaemus pustulosus). Male frogs of this species facultatively produce 2 types of mating calls: simple (whines alone) and complex (whines and chucks). We tested the <b>acoustic</b> <b>preference</b> of the flies {{and their ability to}} locate their host when the frogs produce simple or complex calls. The flies exhibited phonotaxis to both types of calls but were preferentially attracted to complex calls. We show that acoustic information alone is sufficient for the flies' accurate localization of calling frogs. Complex calls, however, were not approached at closer distance or with decreased landing error (i. e., proportion of landings outside the target) than simple calls, suggesting that call structure does not influence localization performance. Female t�ngara frogs and frog-eating bats (Trachops cirrhosus) also prefer complex to simple t�ngara frog calls. Thus, intended and unintended receivers with different ear morphologies exhibit the same preference for a specific t�ngara frog call type. This result is discussed {{in the context of the}} evolution of call attractiveness in a communication network.

40|$|Closely {{related species}} often differ conspicuously in {{secondary}} sexual characters, {{many of which}} may be shaped by sexual selection. Changes in these characters may directly influence speciation, since females use them to assess males and to choose a mate. I investigate the hypothesis that in closely related populations, divergence in preference for sexually selected characters may promote sexual isolation through assortative mating. Ultimately, if reproductive isolation is complete, this process of divergent sexual selection through preference divergence may result in the formation of new species. I have investigated the relationship between divergence in the pulse rate of male song and female preference for pulse rates in a group of Hawaiian crickets, Laupala cerasina. Within a population, males sing at a characteristic pulse rate, but males from different populations sing with significantly different pulse rates. The degree of population divergence is almost an order of magnitude less than that which distinguishes closely related species of Laupala. Using phonotaxis trials, I found that females show <b>acoustic</b> <b>preferences</b> for males whose pulse rates fall nearest to the population mean.

Although the array of benefits is validated for blinds and shutters there are historic barriers to realising the potential for saving energy. Simple behavioural change related {{to the use of}} existing products would be a no cost productivity and energy benefit. Use of blinds and shutters is based on the need of a variety of factors in both commercial and domestic markets. These factors can be categorized into three broad areas namely energy savings, comfort (inclusive of visual, thermal and <b>acoustic</b> <b>preferences)</b> and occupant satisfaction which contribute to improving the health, well-being and productivity of occupants. In recent publications it has been demonstrated how thermal, visual, acoustic and controllability of occupants’ working environments impacts productivity. The business case for linking productivity to ‘green’ working environments has been made by the World Green Building Council (WGBC) highlighting how productivity of staff is a greater incentive for commercial buildings to become more sustainable. This study incorporates a literature review of the sustainable benefits of shading and illustrates how they are an asset to the building façade in creating dynamic, comfortable and potentially productive environments for the commercial sector.

40|$|Abstract only availableMale treefrogs produce {{loud and}} {{persistent}} acoustic signals called advertisement calls to attract mates. Ectothermic animals like frogs face an interesting challenge, in that temperature can significantly impact {{characteristics of the}} species-specific advertisement call. The mate-choice preferences of female gray treefrogs (H. versicolor) have been extensively studied (reviewed by Gerhardt & Huber 2002). It {{has been found that}} females prefer calls with standard frequency peaks of 1. 1 kHz + 2. 2 kHz over calls with higher and lower frequencies at 20 º C. However, it is not known how this preference is affected by temperature. To determine whether <b>acoustic</b> <b>preferences</b> based on frequency are temperature-dependent, I collected female frogs during their breeding season and tested them in a temperature-controlled anechoic testing chamber. I generated ten different computer-synthesized advertisement calls that ranged in frequency between 0. 55 + 1. 1 kHz to 1. 5 + 3. 0 kHz. In two-speaker choice tests conducted at three different temperatures (15 º C, 20 º C and 25 º C), females "chose" (moved within 10 cm of a speaker) between a call with standard frequency peaks of 1. 1 + 2. 2 kHz and one of the nine alternative calls. Preliminary results indicate the preferred frequencies appeared to remain 1. 1 + 2. 2 kHz at lower temperatures. However, at higher temperatures, female frogs were more likely to approach high-frequency calls. These results will be discussed in the context of known temperature-dependent physiological processes in the inner ear of frogs. NIH grant to H. C. Gerhard...|$|R
40|$|Abstract only availableFaculty Mentor: Dr. Sarah Humfeld, Biological SciencesMany anuran amphibians, {{better known}} as frogs and toads, use {{acoustic}} signals {{as a means of}} communication. Female frogs choose mates by moving towards males making a particular call (phonotaxis). Non-calling males, which have been termed satellites, may also associate with these calling males as a result of male-male competition for mates.   My project addressed the question of whether male frogs have phonotactic preferences similar to those of females.   Most Hyla versicolor females prefer calls with a faster-than-average call rate, longer-than-average call duration and low frequency.   My main goal was to verify whether H. versicolor males demonstrate phonotactic behavior, and if so, to determine whether they have preferences similar to females.   I also wanted to learn if non-calling males were inferior to calling males.   I used two methods to answer these questions. During field observations, H. versicolor males (calling and non-calling) were weighed, their calls recorded and body temperature taken. We found no evidence to indicate that non-calling males are smaller or produce less attractive calls than callers. In laboratory phonotaxis experiments, synthetic signals from two speakers were played and the successive movements of individual males were observed. The results indicated that H. versicolor males express phonotactic responses and also have <b>acoustic</b> <b>preferences,</b> which are similar to female preferences. Fourteen of 22 males moved within 20 cm of a speaker, and most of these (13) chose the call with characteristics favored by females. Based on these results we speculate that the ability of males to recognize attractive calls may maximize the reproductive success of satellite males...|$|R
40|$|Acoustical {{conditions}} on stage {{have an influence}} on the sound and character of a musical performance. Musicians constantly adjust their playing to accommodate to the stage acoustics. The study of acoustical preferences of musi- cians {{is part of the}} characterization of this feedback loop, which impacts on the musicians’ comfort {{as well as on the}} aural experience of a concert audience. This paper presents an investigation on preferences of solo musicians on stage. By means of spatial acoustic measurements and real-time auralization, the acoustics of different real rooms are resynthesized in laboratory condi- tions. Two formal tests are conducted with solo trumpet players: a room preference test and a test investigating the preferred directions of early energy. In the first test, mu- sicians are presented with four different rooms and asked about their preference in five different aspects: practice of instrument technique, practice of concert repertoire, con- cert performance, ease of performance and sound quality. In the second test the auralized rooms are modified to pro- vide early reflections from different directions (front-back, top-down, sides, no early reflections) and the preference of musicians is investigated. The results show that the judged aspect or performance context is a key factor in determining the preference of mu- sicians’ stage <b>acoustics</b> <b>preference.</b> Drier rooms are pre- ferred for practicing instrumental technique while louder rooms help to reduce the fatigue of the players. Bigger rooms with slightly longer reverberation are preferred for concert piece practice and concert performance. The easi- ness of performance is proportional to the amount of early energy. Regarding the preference of direction of early re- flections, the results suggest that there are no clear differ- ences between preferred directions, and the level of early energy is more important for the comfort of solo musicians on stage.

40|$|Sexual {{selection}} {{by female}} choice can shape {{the evolution of}} male traits within populations, since the most attractive males experience an increase in fitness through elevated mating success. Speciation by sexual selection occurs when evolution in traits and preferences within populations causes differentiation among populations, such that females in alternative populations prefer sexual signals of their own population relative to others. Differentiated traits and preferences thereby {{play an active role}} in limiting gene flow between divergent populations. The effectiveness of differentiated preferences in maintaining differentiated male signals against the homogenizing effects of gene flow across populations will be limited by both the degree to which females can discriminate against non-local males, and the breeding values of traits and preferences. Populations of the Hawaiian cricket Laupala cerasina have diverged in pulse rate, a sexually selected male signal, and female <b>acoustic</b> <b>preference</b> for pulse rate. Gene flow between neighboring populations may be reduced if migrants from sexually diverged populations experience reduced mating success. We show that females discriminate among divergent songs characteristic of neighboring populations, that diffe­rences among populations in song and preference breed true in a common environment, and that mean preferences for each population closely match the mean pulse rates. Divergence in preference was observed only between populations that also differed in song. Along with a striking ability to discriminate slight differences in song, correlated evolution of song and preference within populations could be a mechanism that promotes assortative mating among populations, thereby reducing gene flow, and leading to speciation in Laupala [Current Zoology 58 (3) : 416 - 425, 2012]...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examined the}} influence of room acoustic variations on listener loudspeaker preferences in multichannel audio reproduction, {{and the extent to}} which listeners adapt to the room <b>acoustics.</b> Listener <b>preferences</b> among 4 different 5 -channel loudspeaker systems were observed in 4 different virtual listening rooms via a binaural room scanning (BRS) measurement and playback system. To study room acoustic adaptation, 2 groups of listeners evaluated identical stimuli according to 2 different trial blocking schemes, termed either the successive or the intermixed treatment. In the successive treatment condition, the loudspeakers were evaluated under a given room acoustic condition before moving to the next block of trials, under a different room acoustic condition. In the intermixed treatment condition, the loudspeakers were evaluated under a different room acoustic condition on each trial within a given block of trials. Although loudspeaker preferences did not differ between these two different trial-blocking schemes, there was a significant influence of room <b>acoustics</b> on loudspeaker <b>preferences.</b> The room <b>acoustic</b> variation to which listeners were exposed also significantly influenced the observed patterns of loudspeaker preferences. These results can be summarized simply as follows: The most reflective listening room produced the lowest overall preference ratings, and also enabled listeners to report the largest differences in loudspeaker preference. It was also found that experienced listeners were more discerning of loudspeaker effects, whereas less experienced listeners were more influenced by room effects. The results indicate that both listening experience and room acoustics significantly influence how listeners formulate loudspeaker preferences...|$|R

40|$|A {{variety of}} parrot species have {{recently}} gained attention {{as members of}} a small group of non-human animals that are capable of coordinating their movements in time with a rhythmic pulse. This capacity is highly developed in humans, who display unparalleled sensitivity to musical beats and appear to prefer rhythmically organized sounds in their music. Do parrots also exhibit a preference for rhythmic over arrhythmic sounds? Here we presented humans and budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) – a small parrot species that have been shown to be able to align movements with a beat – with rhythmic and arrhythmic sound patterns in an <b>acoustic</b> place <b>preference</b> paradigm. Both species were allowed to explore an environment for 5 minutes. We quantified how much time they spent in proximity to rhythmic vs. arrhythmic stimuli. The results show that humans spent more time with rhythmic stimuli, and also preferred rhythmic stimuli when directly asked in a post-test survey. Budgerigars did not show any such overall preferences. However, further examination of the budgerigar results showed an effect of sex, such that male budgerigars spent more time with arrthymic stimuli, and female budgerigars spent more time with rhythmic stimuli. Our results support the idea that rhythmic information is interesting to budgerigars. We suggest that future investigations into the temporal characteristics of naturalistic social behaviors in budgerigars, such as courtship vocalizations and head-bobbing displays, may help explain the sex difference we observed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract only availableThe gray treefrog complex {{consists}} of two cryptic species; Hyla versicolor is a tetraploid (N= 48) species that arose from the polyploidization of its diploid counter-part, H. chrysoscelis (N= 24) and two other extinct treefrog species. Speciation via polyploidy is almost instantaneous because polyploid species are isolated reproductively from their non-polyploid ancestors. However, the establishment of newly arisen polyploid lineages requires assortative mating between polyploids. Genome duplication {{has been shown to}} affect the quality of the male's species-specific mate-attraction signal, thus polyploids could be reproductively isolated from their diploid ancestors through the action of female mating preferences. Autopolyploid individuals I generated last summer (polyploidy was verified by initial karyotyping) are currently reaching sexual maturity. Once sexually mature, the <b>acoustic</b> mate-choice <b>preferences</b> of female polyploids will be tested using playback experiments. The experimental tests will compare preferences for call traits that vary between the two species, including frequency, pulse shape, and pulse rate. We hypothesize that these changes in the communication system result from ploidy-induced changes in tissue and cellular dimensions. Thus, as a related experiment, we will also look for effects of larval density on blood cell size, male calls and female preferences. We expect to find that polyploidy affects the advertisement-call preferences of female H. chrysoscelis treefrogs, independent of other factors. Preliminary results indicate that autopolyploid individuals are able to reach sexual maturity and that there is an effect of polyploidy on blood cell size.

40|$|The {{functional}} {{significance of}} male accessory sex glands (ASG) remains unclear. This study explored their importance in reproduction. In previous investigations, embryos sired by males with ASG either totally or partially removed had {{a shift in}} the cell cycle and delayed cleavage during preimplantation development, higher incidence of apoptosis, early oviductal-uterine transit, higher proportion of embryo degeneration, lower implantation rate, and ultimately reduced fertility and fecundity. Some pups were born alive; but would they be normal? We hypothesized that the first generation offspring (F 1) could also bear undesirable traits. To test our hypothesis, we raised and studied these F 1 pups from birth to 8 weeks. We monitored physical growth and assessed behaviour such as nest patch odor <b>preference,</b> <b>acoustic</b> startle response (ASR) and exploratory activity. We detected deviations from the norm in physical growth, a premature cessation of nest patch odor <b>preferences,</b> accelerated <b>acoustic</b> startle habituation and more frequent rearing when exposed to a novel environment. In terms of structure, we found one incidence of diphallus with duplicated urethra. We concluded that sperm lacking contact with ASG secretions gave rise to progeny with abnormal traits. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

G. was supported by a National Research Council (National Academy of Sciences) Postdoctoral Fellowship at the National Marine Mammal Laboratory, AFSC, NMFS, NOAA. 1. Many animals communicate using sequences of discrete acoustic elements which can be complex, vary in their degree of stereotypy, and are potentially open-ended. Variation in sequences can provide important ecological, behavioural, or evolutionary information about the structure and connectivity of populations, mechanisms for vocal cultural evolution, and the underlying drivers responsible for these processes. Various mathematical techniques have been used to form a realistic approximation of sequence similarity for such tasks. 2. Here, we use both simulated and empirical datasets from animal vocal sequences (rock hyrax, Procavia capensis; humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae; bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus; and Carolina chickadee, Poecile carolinensis) to test which of eight sequence analysis metrics are more likely to reconstruct the information encoded in the sequences, and to test the fidelity of estimation of model parameters, when the sequences are assumed to conform to particular statistical models. 3. Results from the simulated data indicated that multiple metrics were equally successful in reconstructing the information encoded in the sequences of simulated individuals (Markov chains, n-gram models, repeat distribution, and edit distance), and data generated by different stochastic processes (entropy rate and n-grams). However, the string edit (Levenshtein) distance performed consistently and significantly better than all other tested metrics (including entropy, Markov chains, n-grams, mutual information) for all empirical datasets, despite being less commonly used in the field of animal acoustic communication. 4. The Levenshtein distance metric provides a robust analytical approach that should be considered in the comparison of animal <b>acoustic</b> sequences in <b>preference</b> to other commonly employed techniques (such as Markov chains, hidden Markov models, or Shannon entropy). The recent discovery that non-Markovian vocal sequences may be more common in animal communication than previously thought, provides a rich area for future research that requires non-Markovian based analysis techniques to investigate animal grammars and potentially the origin of human language.
