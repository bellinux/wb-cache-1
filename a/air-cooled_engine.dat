25|$|Produced from 1941 to 1945, the V-770 {{featured}} a two-piece aluminum alloy crankcase, steel barreled cylinders with integral aluminum alloy fins and aluminum alloy heads.

25|$|Herbert H. Franklin {{founded the}} H. H. Franklin Manufacturing Company in 1893 and, in 1901, {{teamed up with}} {{engineer}} John Wilkinson to develop an <b>air-cooled</b> <b>engine.</b> In 1902, the Franklin automobile was introduced. Because he was the primary investor, Franklin assumed control of the company, and named the auto manufacturing division Franklin Automobile Company. As president, he managed the company finances and business administration. Wilkinson was named chief engineer and granted control of the engineering and manufacturing operation.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea of a}} canard-based design {{originated}} with Lieutenant Commander Masayoshi Tsuruno, of the technical staff of the IJN in early 1943. Tsuruno believed the design could easily be retrofitted with a turbojet, when suitable engines became available. His ideas were worked out by the First Naval Air Technical Arsenal (Dai-Ichi Kaigun Koku Gijitsusho), which designed three gliders designated Yokosuka MXY6, featuring canards. These were built by Chigasaki Seizo K. K. and one was later fitted with a 22hp Semi 11 (Ha-90) 4-cylinder <b>air-cooled</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Port Victoria aircraft, {{designed}} by W.H. Sayers, was designated P.V.7. It {{was a very}} small single bay tractor biplane, of sesquiplane configuration, with its lower wing much smaller than its upper wing. The wings featured the same high-lift section as used in previous Port Victoria aircraft, and were fitted with ailerons only on the upper wing. It was intended, as was the competing Eastchurch design, to use a 45hp (34kW) geared ABC Gnat two-cylinder <b>air-cooled</b> <b>engine.</b> Armament was a single Lewis gun mounted above the upper wing.|$|E
25|$|The Jupiter was {{designed}} during World War I by Roy Fedden of Cosmos Engineering. During the rapid downscaling of military spending after the war, Cosmos became bankrupt in 1920, and was eventually {{purchased by the}} Bristol Aeroplane Company on {{the strengths of the}} Jupiter design and the encouragement of the Air Ministry. The engine matured {{into one of the most}} reliable on the market. It was the first <b>air-cooled</b> <b>engine</b> to pass the Air Ministry full-throttle test, the first to be equipped with automatic boost control, and the first to be fitted to airliners.|$|E
25|$|This was the Rover Scarab with a {{rear-mounted}} V-twin-cylinder <b>air-cooled</b> <b>engine</b> {{announced in}} 1931, a van version was shown at Olympia, {{but it did}} not go into production. During this time the Rover 10/25 was introduced, with bodies made by the Pressed Steel Company. This was the same body as used on the Hillman Minx. Prior to this time Rover had been a great supporter of the very light Weymann bodies that went suddenly out of fashion with the demand for shiny coachwork and more curved body shapes. Weymann bodies remained in the factory catalogue until 1933.|$|E

The commercialization, attempted between 1921 and 1923, was unsuccessful due to a combination of factors, nontechnical and technical. <b>Air-cooled</b> <b>engines</b> have had commercial success before and since, in various fields (small engines, aircraft, cars), but the historical moment of GM's [...] "copper-cooled" [...] automotive engine was [...]|$|R

25|$|Maintenance {{difficulties}} with the Atsuta and Ha-40 engines {{eventually led to}} the installation of the more reliable Mitsubishi Kinsei 62 radial engine for the Yokosuka D4Y3 Model 33,> and the Mitsubishi Ha-112 radial <b>air-cooled</b> <b>engine</b> for the IJAAS's Kawasaki Ki-61, which then became known as the Kawasaki Ki-100. Such a modification was not possible for the Aichi M6A1 Seiran as it could only use the liquid-cooled inverted-vee type engine, as it had to fit the submarine's confined hangar, becoming the only Japanese airplane that retained the inverted-vee engine installation through {{to the end of the}} war.|$|E
25|$|The hottest {{points on}} any <b>air-cooled</b> <b>engine</b> are the {{cylinder}} heads, located around {{the circumference of}} a radial engine. In order to provide sufficient air to cool the engine, airflow had to be maximized at this outer edge. This was normally accomplished by leaving {{the majority of the}} front face of the engine open to the air, causing considerable drag. During the late 1920s, NACA led development of a dramatic improvement by placing an airfoil-shaped ring around the outside of the cylinder heads (the NACA cowling). The shaping accelerated the air as it entered the front of the cowl, increasing the total airflow, and allowing the opening in front of the engine to be made smaller.|$|E
25|$|The Sparviero had an all wood, low mounted {{cantilever}} wing of isosceles trapezoidal plan, {{built around a}} single spar and covered with stressed plywood skin, with differential ailerons and trailing edge flaps. The fuselage was a ply skinned wooden monocoque, built in two sections which bolted together just aft of the wings. The forward part held the cabin, which seated four in two pairs, with access via two wide doors over the wings. The roof line of the cabin continued aft into that of the rear fuselage. The Sparviero was initially powered by a 250hp (187kW) Hirth inverted V-8 <b>air-cooled</b> <b>engine,</b> though it was the intention to replace this with a 260hp (194kW) Lycoming horizontally opposed engine in production models and the prototype received one later. Fuel was fed from three tanks, two in the wings {{and one in the}} fuselage. The tail unit was conventional, with the tailplane just above the fuselage. The latter tapered in height rearwards and the fin merged into it with a dorsal fillet. The empennage construction was {{similar to that of the}} wing, except that the control surfaces were fabric covered. The tricycle undercarriage was retractable and fitted with hydraulic brakes.|$|E
