5|$|The {{most common}} adverse effect to {{acetylcysteine}} treatment is an anaphylactoid reaction, usually manifested by rash, wheeze, or mild hypotension. Adverse reactions {{are more common}} in people treated with IV acetylcysteine, occurring in up to 20% of patients. Alaphylactoid reactions {{are more likely to}} occur with the first infusion (the loading dose). Rarely, severe life-threatening reactions may occur in predisposed individuals, such <b>as</b> <b>patients</b> with asthma or atopic dermatitis, and may be characterized by respiratory distress, facial swelling, and even death.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{effective}} as medication given {{a couple of}} hours before surgery to relieve anxiety. They also produce amnesia, which can be useful, <b>as</b> <b>patients</b> may not remember unpleasantness from the procedure. They are also used in patients with dental phobia as well as some ophthalmic procedures like refractive surgery; although such use is controversial and only recommended for those who are very anxious. Midazolam is the most commonly prescribed for this use because of its strong sedative actions and fast recovery time, as well as its water solubility, which reduces pain upon injection. Diazepam and lorazepam are sometimes used. Lorazepam has particularly marked amnesic properties that may make it more effective when amnesia is the desired effect.|$|E
5|$|On 17 November, Major General Andrija Rašeta, the {{commander}} of the JNA 5th (Zagreb) Military District, notified the European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM) that the JNA accepted in principle the quick evacuation of vulnerable persons from Vukovar. At the time, it was estimated that there were about 400 people trapped in the city's hospital, but the actual number was later discovered to be about 450. This included about 40 patients receiving treatment for severe injuries sustained over the preceding few days and about 360 patients recovering from wounds suffered earlier on. In addition to these individuals, some civilians had taken shelter in the hospital {{in the final days of}} the battle. They moved there expecting to be evacuated from the city, even though the hospital itself was subjected to daily artillery attack. Furthermore, a number of Croatian troops took refuge in the hospital posing <b>as</b> <b>patients</b> or staff.|$|E

5|$|Tawau has one public hospital, four {{public health}} clinics, three {{maternal}} {{and child health}} clinics, seven village clinics, one mobile clinic and two 1Malaysia clinics. Tawau Hospital, on Tanjung Batu Street, is the town's main hospital and an important healthcare facility for patients from Semporna, Lahad Datu, Kunak, and Sandakan. Indonesian patients near the border area also frequently visit the hospital. Tawau Specialist Polyclinics (TSPC) is a walk-in healthcare clinic that sees patients from Tawau and surrounding areas as well <b>as</b> <b>patients</b> from neighbouring Philippines and Indonesia. TSPC has a range of medical specialists, a medical laboratory and radiology services. The hospital has undergone a series of modernisations since 1990 with the construction of specialist clinics, Central Sterile Services Department (CSSD), new wards and operation theatres. Tawau Specialist Hospital is the only private hospital in the town. The Tawau Regional Library is one of three regional libraries in Sabah, the others are at Keningau and Sandakan. These libraries are operated by the Sabah State Library department. Some schools, colleges, or universities have private libraries.|$|E
5|$|The {{shift to}} {{outsourcing}} raises issues about data integrity, regulatory oversight, language difficulties, {{the meaning of}} informed consent among a much poorer population, the standards of clinical care, {{the extent to which}} corruption may be regarded as routine in certain countries, and the ethical problem of raising a population's expectations for drugs that most of that population cannot afford. It also {{raises the question of whether}} the results of clinical trials using one population can invariably be applied elsewhere. There are both social and physical differences: Goldacre asks whether patients diagnosed with depression in China are really the same <b>as</b> <b>patients</b> diagnosed with depression in California, and notes that people of Asian descent metabolize drugs differently from Westerners.|$|E

25|$|Preparations {{which contain}} {{paracetamol}} may also induce severe liver toxicity resulting from paracetamol poisoning.

25|$|Naming {{involves}} {{the ability to}} recall an object. Patients with TSA, as well <b>as</b> <b>patients</b> with all other aphasia subtypes, exhibit poor naming. Clinical assessment of naming {{involves the}} observer first asking the patient to name high frequency objects such as clock, door, and chair. TSA patients who name common objects with ease generally have difficulty naming both uncommon objects and specific parts of objects such as lapel, or the dial on a watch.|$|E

25|$|Individuals {{with mental}} health {{conditions}} are commonly referred to <b>as</b> <b>patients</b> but may also be called clients, consumers, or service recipients. They may come {{under the care of}} a psychiatric physician or other psychiatric practitioners by various paths, the two most common being self- or referral by a primary-care physician. Alternatively, a person may be referred by hospital medical staff, by court order, involuntary commitment, or, in the UK and Australia, by sectioning under a mental health law.|$|E
25|$|However, <b>as</b> <b>patients</b> with tumors {{containing}} {{mixtures of}} histological subtypes are usually excluded from clinical trials, {{the properties of}} multiphasic tumors like c-SCLC are much less well understood than those of monophasic tumors. C-SCLC contains both SCLC and NSCLC by definition, and since patients with SCLC and NSCLC are usually treated differently, the lack of good data on c-SCLC means {{there is little evidence}} available with which to form consensus about whether c-SCLC should be treated like SCLC, NSCLC, or uniquely.|$|E

25|$|According to Henry Krystal, {{individuals}} {{suffering from}} alexithymia think in an operative way and {{may appear to}} be superadjusted to reality. In psychotherapy, however, a cognitive disturbance becomes apparent <b>as</b> <b>patients</b> tend to recount trivial, chronologically ordered actions, reactions, and events of daily life with monotonous detail. In general, these individuals lack imagination, intuition, empathy, and drive-fulfillment fantasy, especially in relation to objects. Instead, they seem oriented toward things and even treat themselves as robots. These problems seriously limit their responsiveness to psychoanalytic psychotherapy; psychosomatic illness or substance abuse is frequently exacerbated should these individuals enter psychotherapy.|$|E
25|$|Health literacy. This {{is where}} {{patients}} have problems obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information. For example, {{patients with a}} poor understanding of good health may not know when {{it is necessary to}} seek care for certain symptoms. While problems with health literacy are not limited to minority groups, the problem can be more pronounced in these groups than in whites due to socioeconomic and educational factors. A study conducted in Mdantsane, South Africa depicts the correlation of maternal education and the antenatal visits for pregnancy. <b>As</b> <b>patients</b> have a greater education, they tend to use maternal health care services more than those with a lesser maternal education background.|$|E
25|$|Although {{clinical}} {{psychologists and}} psychiatrists {{can be said}} to share a same fundamental aim—the alleviation of mental distress—their training, outlook, and methodologies are often quite different. Perhaps the most significant difference is that psychiatrists are licensed physicians. As such, psychiatrists often use the medical model to assess psychological problems (i.e., those they treat are seen <b>as</b> <b>patients</b> with an illness) and rely on psychotropic medications as the chief method of addressing the illness—although many also employ psychotherapy as well. Psychiatrists and medical psychologists (who are clinical psychologists that are also licensed to prescribe) are able to conduct physical examinations, order and interpret laboratory tests and EEGs, and may order brain imaging studies such as CT or CAT, MRI, and PET scanning.|$|E
