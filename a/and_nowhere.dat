5|$|In {{addition}} to her work in big-budget productions, Baker also appeared in small, independent films, such as Just Your Luck (1996) <b>and</b> <b>Nowhere</b> to Go (1997). The '90s also had Baker more frequently appearing on television series, including episodes of Grand (1990), Tales from the Crypt (1991, opposite Teri Garr in a segment directed by Michael J. Fox), Murder, She Wrote and L.A. Law (both 1993); Chicago Hope (1995), and Roswell (1999). In 2000, she appeared in the Lifetime film Another Woman's Husband. In 2002, Baker appeared in the documentary Cinerama Adventure, and guest-starred on an episode of The Lyon's Den, playing Rob Lowe's mother. Her role on The Lyon's Den was Baker's last screen appearance before she formally retired from acting in 2003. Her acting career spanned 50 years, and more than 80 roles in film, television, and theater.|$|E
5|$|West Germany and East Germany were {{formally}} reunited on 3 October 1990. The 63rd Academy Awards, held on 25 March 1991, {{were thus}} the first at which Germany {{was able to}} participate as a single country. Reunified Germany {{has been successful in}} the Best Foreign Language Film category, securing two wins and eight nominations in less than two decades. The two German films that received the award since reunification are The Lives of Others (2006) by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck <b>and</b> <b>Nowhere</b> in Africa (2001) by Caroline Link, the only German director to have more than one film nominated for the award. Several other German films have received Academy Awards in categories other than Best Foreign Language Film.|$|E

The group included Hungary which had been considered {{by far the best}} team in the world some years ago – although the Hungarians could not beat West Germany in the final of the World Cup in 1954. But the Hungarian team had been dealt a blow by the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 after which star players like Sándor Kocsis and Ferenc Puskás left their homeland.

25|$|In the Hellsing manga {{series by}} Kouta Hirano, {{one of the}} {{depicted}} Nazis is an artificial catboy named Schrödinger. He claims that he is everywhere <b>and</b> <b>nowhere</b> at the same time, {{which is similar to}} the cat being alive and dead at the same time. It is also said that he can only exist as long as he is aware of himself. In the second anime adaption, he eventually allows himself to be absorbed by the vampire Alucard, which causes his awareness to be clouded. This then spreads to Alucard, who vanishes for thirty years. Alucard returns after destroying the millions of souls within himself, giving him access to all of Schrödinger's abilities.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} with David Letterman, Lewis talked about hitchhiking across the country back to New York City and how he learned to play the harmonica while waiting for rides. He talked about {{hanging out at the}} airport for three days until he stowed away on a plane to Europe. In later interviews, Lewis would reveal other encounters he had traveling around Europe. While visiting Aberdeen, Scotland, with no money <b>and</b> <b>nowhere</b> to sleep, he claimed that the locals were very hospitable by offering him somewhere to stay. In Madrid, Spain, he became an accomplished blues player as he hitchhiked and supported himself by busking with his harmonica. He gave his first concerts in Madrid, earning enough money to buy a plane ticket back to the USA.|$|E

25|$|It is {{critical}} to determine a proper temperature for the annealing step because efficiency and specificity are strongly affected by the annealing temperature. This temperature must be low enough to allow for hybridization of the primer to the strand, but high enough for the hybridization to be specific, i.e., the primer should bind only to a perfectly complementary part of the strand, <b>and</b> <b>nowhere</b> else. If the temperature is too low, the primer may bind imperfectly. If it is too high, the primer may not bind at all. A typical annealing temperature is about 3–5°C below the Tm of the primers used. Stable hydrogen bonds between complementary bases are formed only when the primer sequence very closely matches the template sequence. During this step, the polymerase binds to the primer-template hybrid and begins DNA formation.|$|E
25|$|The Herăști {{building}} impressed {{a foreign}} traveler, Paul of Aleppo, {{who claimed that}} no other such home existed in the Danubian Principalities, <b>and</b> <b>nowhere</b> in Europe except the Kingdom of France. Paul was also perplexed that the monument was built {{so close to the}} Danube, in an exposed location on the Wallachian Plain, which could allow it to be ransacked by Ottoman invaders. It is however known that Năsturel kept a second such home, in Transylvania, alongside his lesser residences in Târgoviște and Bucharest. He and Elena co-funded the church in Herăști, with Udriște alone being the ktitor of Târgului Church in Târgoviște. The former building was partly designed by a Mamant Barbulov, possibly a naturalized Bulgarian, who may have added the Oriental brickwork to the nearby palace. Năsturel is also listed as a ktitor of Sfânta Vineri Herasca in Bucharest, which was located close to his townhouse. In fact, he and Elena supported financially rather than built the latter.|$|E
25|$|Towards 1:00 pm, in {{the thick}} mix of gun smoke and fog {{covering}} the field, the king was separated from his fellow riders and suffered multiple shots. A bullet crushed his left arm below the elbow. Almost simultaneously his horse suffered a shot to the neck that {{made it hard to}} control. In the mix of fog and smoke from the burning town of Lützen the king rode astray behind enemy lines. There he sustained yet another shot in the back, was stabbed and fell from his horse. Lying on the ground, he received a final, fatal shot to the temple. His fate remained unknown for some time. However, when the gunnery paused and the smoke cleared, his horse was spotted between the two lines, Gustavus himself not on it <b>and</b> <b>nowhere</b> to be seen. His disappearance stopped the initiative of the hitherto successful Swedish right wing, while a search was conducted. His partly stripped body was found an hour or two later, and was secretly evacuated from the field in a Swedish artillery wagon.|$|E

25|$|The black-necked stork {{is widely}} {{scattered}} <b>and</b> <b>nowhere</b> found in high densities, {{making it difficult}} for populations to be reliably estimated. The Sri Lankan population has been estimated to be about 50 birds while the species has become very rare in Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia. They may be extinct in the Sundaic region. The combined South and South-east Asian population is placed at less than 1000 birds. A 2011 study found the population in south-western Uttar Pradesh to be stable, although population growth rates may decline with {{an increase in the number}} of dry years or land use changes that permanently remove the number of breeding pairs. The Australian population has been optimistically estimated at about 20,000 birds while a more conservative estimate suggests about 10,000 birds. They are threatened by habitat destruction, the draining of shallow wetlands, overfishing, pollution, collision with electricity wires and hunting. Few breeding populations with high breeding success are known primarily due to lack of field work. It is evaluated as near threatened on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} very few, short visual {{observations}} of right whale behavior in the North Pacific. The mid-19th century whaling onslaught occurred before there was much scientific interest in whale behavior, and included no scientific observation. By the time scientific interest in this species developed, very few whales remained <b>and</b> <b>nowhere</b> in the eastern North Pacific or Bering Sea could observers reliably find them. Based on limited observations in the 19th century, {{it was noted that}} the more extensively whaling was conducted, the more aggressive and harder to approach the whales became. These traits correspond with some of recent observations in which whales seemed to be very sensitive to vessels and easily swim away with by submerging longer to avoid ships enough for onlookers and observers to lose sights. Pre-World War I whaling logs from Japan also describe right whales as being among the most sensitive of targeted baleen or toothed species to the impacts of whaling, as they immediately fled from locations where whaling took place, possibly abandoning their habitat for good.|$|E
25|$|Marcus {{had much}} {{love and respect}} for his adoptive father. The tribute he gives Pius in the first book of the Meditations is the longest of any.

Prohibition of unnatural practices, social tact and permission to his suite not invariably to be present at his banquets nor to attend his progress from Rome, as a matter of obligation, and always to be found the same by those who had failed to attend him through engagements. Exact scrutiny in council and patience; not that he was avoiding investigation, satisfied with first impressions. An inclination to keep his friends, <b>and</b> <b>nowhere</b> fastidious or the victim of manias but his own master in everything, and his outward mien cheerful. His long foresight and ordering of the merest trifle without making scenes. The check in his reign put upon organized applause and every form of lip-service; his unceasing watch over the needs of the empire and his stewardship of its resources; his patience under criticism by individuals of such conduct. No superstitious fear of divine powers nor with man any courting of the public or obsequiousness or cultivation of popular favour, but temperance in all things and firmness; nowhere want of taste or search for novelty.|$|E
