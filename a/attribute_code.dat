Important issues like interpretive, complex nature of geologic map, scale of original survey, basemap content, presentation of structural features, adherence to international conventions and media of map presentation has to be addressed before postulating a national standard for map presentation. Consistency has to be maintained in original surveying, in descriptive information, <b>attributes</b> <b>codes</b> and in compiling maps. Unless these prerequisites are fulfilled, any effort to prepare a digital cartographic standard will be futile.
