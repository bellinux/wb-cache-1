6000|$|Sweet Emma Moreland of yonder town [...] Met me {{walking on}} yonder way, [...] "And {{have you lost}} your heart?" [...] she said; [...] "And <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>married</b> yet, Edward Gray?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will take}} my chance of that. What {{is the use}} of troubling one's head about such a snake of a man? And now, Allan, I have {{something}} to ask you. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>married</b> yet?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are not {{interested}} in wood-chucks, Comrade Parker? Well, well, many people are not. A passion for the flora and fauna of our forests is innate rather than acquired. Let us talk of something else. Tell me about your home-life, Comrade Parker. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>married?</b> Are there any little Parkers running about the house? When you return from this very pleasant excursion will baby voices crow gleefully, 'Fahzer's come home'?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My! and <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>married</b> in sacret, Miss?" [...] {{said the}} girl, coming nearer to her mistress, and opening {{her eyes as}} wide as she could.|$|R
6000|$|... "But why? When <b>you</b> <b>were</b> younger, before <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>married,</b> <b>you</b> {{all lived}} at home together--or, perhaps, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> an only child?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, Rosa, well!' said Mrs. Steerforth, as {{the other}} was about to interpose, 'it is no matter. Let it <b>be.</b> <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>married,</b> sir, I am told?' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{should like}} to fill several volumes with {{accounts}} of various University Snobs; so fond are my reminiscences of them, and so numerous are they. I {{should like to}} speak, above all, of the wives and daughters {{of some of the}} Professor-Snobs; their amusements, habits, jealousies; their innocent artifices to entrap young men; their picnics, concerts, and evening-parties. I wonder what has become of Emily Blades, daughter of Blades, the Professor of the Mandingo language? I remember her shoulders to this day, as she sat {{in the midst of a}} crowd of about seventy young gentlemen, from Corpus and Catherine Hall, entertaining them with ogles and French songs on the guitar. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>married,</b> fair Emily of the shoulders? What beautiful ringlets those were that used to dribble over them!--what a waist!--what a killing sea-green shot-silk gown!--what a cameo, the size of a muffin! There were thirty-six young men of the University in love at one time with Emily Blades: and no words are sufficient to describe the pity, the sorrow, the deep, deep commiseration--the rage, fury, and uncharitableness, in other words--with which the Miss Trumps (daughter of Trumps, the Professor of Phlebotomy) regarded her, because she DIDN'T squint, and because she WASN'T marked with the small-pox.|$|E

5000|$|Sally: Wow, you’re so much taller in person…Mr. O.: Sally, I’m {{not really}} real, I’m {{animated}} —Sally: Aw, not to me, you’re not. Oh, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>married?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not <b>married</b> <b>you</b> might {{write for}} a newspaper. At any rate, if I <b>were</b> <b>you,</b> I should <b>be</b> {{very proud of}} my brother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense, child! When <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>married,</b> <b>you</b> {{will know}} that the easiest of all secrets to keep is a secret from your husband. I give you my promise. Now begin!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} glad to see <b>you</b> <b>marry</b> early," [...] said the Duke, {{speaking}} in a low voice, almost solemnly, but in his quietest, sweetest tone of voice. [...] "You are peculiarly situated. Though as yet <b>you</b> <b>are</b> only {{the heir to the}} property and honours of our family, still, <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>married,</b> almost everything would be at your disposal. There is so much which I should only be too ready to give up to you!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Have you {{entered into}} {{contract}} or agreement with any {{person or persons}} whomsoever, for a term of service, within the United States for lewd and immoral purposes? Do you wish of your own free and voluntary will {{to go to the}} United States? Do you go to the United States for the purposes of prostitution? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>married</b> or single? What are you going to the United States for? What is to be your occupation there? Have you lived in a house of prostitution in Hong Kong, Macao, or China? Have you engaged in prostitution in either of the above places? Are you a virtuous woman? Do you intend to live a virtuous life in the United States? Do you know that you are at liberty now to go to the United States, or remain in your own country, and that you cannot be forced to go away from your home? ...|$|E
5000|$|Sahih Muslim Book 17 {{has several}} hadith {{regarding}} Stoning specifically (17:4191-4209, and 17:4914). For example, Abu Huraira {{reported that a}} person from amongst the Muslims came to Allah's Messenger {{while he was in}} the mosque. He called him saying: Allah's Messenger. I have committed adultery. He (the Holy Prophet) turned away from him, He (again) came round facing him and said to him: Allah's Messenger, I have committed adultery. He (the Holy Prophet) turned away until he did that four times, and as he testified four times against his own self, Allah's Messenger called him and said: Are you mad? He said: No. He (again) said: <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>married?</b> He said: Yes. Thereupon Allah's Messenger said: Take him and stone him. Ibn Shihab (one of the narrators) said: One who had heard Jabir b. 'Abdullah saying this informed me thus: I was one of those who stoned him. We stoned him at the place of prayer (either that of 'Id or a funeral). When the stones hurt him, he ran away. We caught him in the Harra and stoned him (to death). This hadith has been narrated through another chain of transmitters. [...] see also , , ...|$|E
60|$|But Habogi {{would not}} stop or listen. 'When <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>married</b> <b>you</b> will {{have plenty of time}} to choose one,' was all he answered, and they rode on two or three miles further.|$|R
60|$|WALPOLE. Rot! <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>married</b> already when <b>you</b> <b>married</b> her; {{and that}} settles it.|$|R
5000|$|... "When I meet a {{beautiful}} girl, {{the first thing}} I say <b>is</b> 'will <b>you</b> <b>marry</b> me?'. The second thing I say <b>is,</b> 'how do <b>you</b> do?'" [...] - [...] Tommy Manville ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{was very}} sober indeed now. [...] "That's the reason I make mine now. I {{want you to}} know just what I <b>am</b> before <b>you</b> <b>marry</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|Don Jer. Throw your snowy {{arms about}} him, Margaret.--[Exeunt ISAAC and DUENNA.] But, Louisa, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> really <b>married</b> to this modest gentleman? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{no one to}} live there. If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>married</b> <b>you</b> might perhaps take it." [...] This was {{of course}} said in joke, as old Mrs. Morton would have thought Bragton to be disgraced for ever, even by such a proposition.|$|R
60|$|Algernon. Well, my dear fellow, {{you need}} not eat as if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> going to eat it all. You behave as if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>married</b> to her already. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> not <b>married</b> to her already, and I don't think <b>you</b> ever will <b>be.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Chawls," [...] says he, {{handing me}} over a tenpun-note, [...] "here's your wagis, {{and thank you}} for getting me out of the scrape with the bailiffs: when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>married,</b> <b>you</b> shall <b>be</b> my valet out of liv'ry, and I'll treble your salary." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, Robert! {{how do you}} do? I {{remember}} you very well: you used {{to give me a}} ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana's bay pony. And how <b>is</b> Bessie? <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>married</b> to Bessie?" ...|$|R
60|$|Dor. Remember, I invade no propriety: my servant <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> only 'till <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>married.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Deane smiled. [...] "Let us hope," [...] said he, [...] "that after <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>married</b> <b>you</b> {{will still}} regard the {{situation}} in the same light. Your friend Julia, for instance, declares that she would never have married anyone who was not kept away from home at regular intervals." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{says that}} <b>you</b> cannot <b>marry</b> {{while she is}} alive,--that <b>is,</b> that <b>you</b> cannot <b>marry</b> me because your income would not be sufficient." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>are</b> <b>you</b> really <b>married</b> to my sister, sir?" [...] asked Jeanie, {{in great}} doubt and anxiety; for the haughty, {{careless}} tone {{in which he}} spoke seemed to justify her worst apprehensions.|$|R
60|$|PICKERING. But you've {{been through}} it before, man. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>married</b> to Eliza's mother.|$|R
60|$|Bel. An {{you make}} no better harmony after <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>married,</b> than <b>you</b> have before, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> the miserablest couple in Christendom.|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{man would}} have {{submitted}} himself to an engagement with such a condition. It is quite impossible. What! Mr. Gilmore knew when you took him that if this gentleman should choose {{to change his mind}} at any moment before <b>you</b> <b>were</b> actually <b>married,</b> <b>you</b> would walk off and go back to him!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never said}} {{anything}} of the kind. Whom <b>you</b> should <b>marry</b> <b>is</b> a question <b>you</b> must decide for yourself. All that I said <b>was,</b> that if <b>you</b> <b>marry</b> Lord Roehampton, it is fortunate he is so much liked by Mr. Neuchatel." ...|$|R
60|$|Warn. When <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>married,</b> you'll soon make trial, {{whether she}} be a maid or no.|$|R
60|$|Oh--yes, I {{thought it}} would {{interest}} Charlie to know how extremely needful it <b>was</b> for <b>you</b> to <b>marry</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|... "You seem {{to think}} you have made some promise to him which will <b>be</b> broken if <b>you</b> <b>marry</b> her;--and I suppose you {{certainly}} have made her a promise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Deadt--deadt long ago. Right after I {{got home}} from the war--tventy years ago. But tell me, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>married?</b> Children? Yes! Goodt! And how oldt <b>are</b> <b>you</b> now?" ...|$|R
