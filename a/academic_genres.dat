50|$|The Romantic era {{witnessed}} {{the triumph of}} academic history painting, guided at the Academy by Francesco Hayez, {{and the introduction of}} the landscape as an acceptable <b>academic</b> <b>genre,</b> inspired by Massimo D'Azeglio and Giuseppe Bisi, while the Academy moved towards becoming an institution for teaching the history of art.

40|$|The book brings {{together}} a rich variety of perspectives on abstracts as an <b>academic</b> <b>genre.</b> Drawing on genre analysis and corpus linguistics, the studies collected here combine attention to generic structure {{with emphasis on}} language variation and change, thus offering a multi-perspective view on a genre that is {{becoming one of the}} most important in present-day research communication. The chapters are organized into three sections, each one offering distinct but sometimes combined perspectives on the exploration of this <b>academic</b> <b>genre.</b> The first section looks at variation across cultures through studies comparing English with Spanish, Italian and German, while also including considerations on variation across genders or the native/non-native divide. The second section centres on variation across disciplines and includes a wide range of studies exploring disciplinary identities and communities, as well as different degrees of centrality in the disciplinary community. The third and final section explores language and genre change by looking at how authorial voice and metadiscourse have changed over the past few decades under the influence of different media and different stakeholders...|$|R
5000|$|While WAC {{is usually}} {{understood}} as distributing writing {{across the curriculum}} in courses outside of English departments, a WAC philosophy can also influence the structure of first-year composition courses. Because first-year composition is often the only writing course students take, {{the composition of the}} class can shape students' understanding of what writing is. Incorporating writing from diverse <b>academic</b> <b>genres</b> can therefore expand students' expectations about what constitutes [...] "writing." [...] WAC in first-year composition owes much to genre theory (genre studies) which asks students to think about the classification and rhetorical implications of writing within socially constructed genres.|$|E
5000|$|Writing-in-the-disciplines adherents, {{well aware}} of the wide range of <b>academic</b> <b>genres</b> a first-year {{composition}} student may have to deal with in the future, are unlikely to force those students to venture so deeply into any one genre as to require slavish imitation. The only first-year composition teachers likely to demand [...] "conformity and submission" [...] to a particular kind of academic discourse are those English-department fixtures, the evangelical disciples of literature, professors whose goal in first-year composition is to teach students to explicate belles lettres. Writing-in-the-disciplines adherents, unlike teachers of literature-as-composition, generally recognize the folly of forcing students to conform to the conventions of a discourse community they have no desire to join.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{comparative}} lack {{of interest}} in oral academic corpora and in comparisons between spoken and written academic discourse is surprising in that research on academic registers has found that mode differences are extremely important in accounting for linguistic variation (e. g. Biber, 2006; Swales, 2004). Spoken <b>academic</b> <b>genres,</b> such as conference presentations, display a very different range of lexico-grammatical features from written <b>academic</b> <b>genres</b> (Carter-Thomas & Rowley-Jolivet, 2001). It was therefore with the aim of redressing this balance that the EIIDA project was created. The main rationale behind the EIIDA project 4 was to create a corpus enabling the comparison of academic discourse from a triply contrastive perspective: discipline, language and mode...|$|E
30|$|Viewing from a genre perspective, the SoP is {{a highly}} complex <b>academic</b> <b>genre.</b> Unlike other student genres with {{relatively}} rigid structures, few graduate programs offer detailed requirements for SoP writing, which, combined with the varying expectations held by different graduate programs’ gatekeepers, creates enormous challenges for novice SoP writers (Chiu, 2015, 2016; Ding, 2007; Samraj & Monk, 2008). These challenges have been further intensified {{by the lack of}} institutional support for SoP writing (Brown, 2004; Dubb, 2011).|$|R
30|$|Research {{articles}} (RAs) are {{acknowledged as}} the most important form of scientific discourse because they are leading means of distributing academic knowledge for future use. Over the recent decades, the study of RAs has received much attention in the <b>academic</b> <b>genre</b> analysis. A variety of perspectives has been put under deep consideration, including organization, lexicon, cohesion and coherence markers, rhetorical moves, etc. (e.g., Hyland & Tse, 2005; Khany & Tazik, 2010; Li & Ge, 2009; Luo & Hyland, 2016; Swales, 2004).|$|R

An initial analysis of 496 weblogs in use within tertiary level institutions {{was reduced to}} an in-depth analysis of 39 academic weblogs (a corpus of 16 million words). The objective was {{to see how much}} variation there might be between traditional <b>academic</b> <b>genres</b> and academic weblogs. The initial hypothesis is that academic weblogs are far less formal and would favour greater use of lexico-grammatical realisations belonging to the interpersonal function of language. In order to quantify this possible variation between traditional <b>academic</b> <b>genres</b> and academic weblogs, some well-known linguistic features which have been considered to be typical of academic discourse such as the agentless passive and nominalisations were investigated...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{examines}} some {{limits of}} the introduction of SFL-based CLIL approach in non-western sociological doctoral programmes.

I present a historical overview of this <b>academic</b> <b>genre,</b> within a universe primarily scientific and male, which has been prone to periods of restrictions and expansions, depending on the political and educational conjunctures of the country. I discuss questions of gender from a dual perspective: in the first, as an autobiographical <b>academic,</b> hybrid, <b>genre,</b> which is characterized by its position {{between the public and}} the private, interlacing institutional injunction (evaluation), with autobiographical seduction (self- awareness); the second perspective examines the transformation of this genre through female/feminist writing and empowerment as an historical apex, due to {{the increase in the number}} of women in higher education and the use of these writings in pedagogical practices of teacher training.

40|$|The {{academic}} {{routine is}} permeated by {{the production and}} circulation of key genres {{to the success of}} social practices and the preservation, transformation and teaching / learning of cultural traditions. The <b>academic</b> abstract <b>genre</b> is one of those genres that usually occurs with other <b>genres</b> such as <b>academic</b> article, dissertation, thesis and oral communication. In order to compare the rhetoric configuration of examples of three modalities of the <b>academic</b> summary <b>genre</b> (BIASI-RODRIGUES, 2009), namely: congress’s abstracts, summaries accompanying the <b>academic</b> article <b>genre</b> and abstracts accompanying dissertations and theses, we have analyzed the samples {{in the light of the}} proposed methodology of Biasi-Rodrigues (1998) and the theoretical considerations of Motta-Roth and Hendges (2010) and Biasi-Rodrigues (2009). The investigation suggested distinctions in the rhetorical description of the three modalities of academic summary gender analyzed and raised new approach possibilities of what is described by Biasi-Rodrigues (2009) ...|$|R

This paper aims to explore the differences between RA abstracts by native and non-native speakers of English in terms of the generic structure. Theoretically, the commonly accepted IMRD model (Introduction-Method-Results-Discussion) and Swale’s Move-Step model are adopted to analyse the macro- and micro-structure respectively.

40|$|Assuming {{that the}} success of {{students}} in graduate courses depends on their skill to understand and produce the genres required by the academic setting, this work aims to investigate to what extent these courses contribute to the literacy of students in <b>academic</b> <b>genres.</b> It still discusses the relationship between students' expectations and the effectively acquired ability to produce and understand genres such as summaries, reviews, research projects and monographs. To answer the questions that guided this research, two procedures were adopted: first, questionnaires were administered to students from a specialization course on teaching of Portuguese language. Then, we analyzed a corpus of 10 monographs for completion of the course, with their respective drafts, to reflect the construction process. The results indicate that, despite contact with various <b>academic</b> <b>genres,</b> students encounter significant difficulties, especially in writing, the most critical example being the production of the monograph for course completion...|$|E
40|$|Hyland’s {{definition}} of genres as ‘abstract, socially recognised ways of using language’ is general {{enough to be}} widely acceptable, but as such it masks significant differences in how genres are more specifically defined and operationalised in research and teaching contexts.

40|$|This opinion piece {{considers}} the textbook as an <b>academic</b> <b>genre</b> and wonders whether, {{as it could}} be seen to have been developed based on now outmoded concepts and technologies, the textbook is outmoded itself.

This is demonstrated with the example of Writing Essays by Pictures, a recently published stand-alone resource that aims to facilitate the researching and writing of a basic research based essay for first year undergraduate students...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{present study}} aims {{to add to}} our {{knowledge}} about economic rhetoric by conducting a data-driven analysis of economic academic discourse, both synchronically in its contemporary form, and diachronically {{over the past four}} decades. We find (1) that linguistically, economics is clearly an <b>academic</b> <b>genre</b> of its own, (2) that there are at the same time clear differences in vocabulary and style usage across economic journals, and (3) that there have been major developments in economic prose during the past four decades.

The selected corpus was analyzed through the model suggested by Hyland and Tse (2004). The results demonstrated that the two languages are distinct in their use of metadiscourse in the discipline studied. It was found that Persian, unlike English, relied on interactive resources more. The disciplinary distinction indicates that Persian computer engineering provides more textual elements while English language values a reader responsible trend...|$|R

40|$|First year {{students}} often experience a culture shock as certain literacy practices {{at the university}} level are different from their experiences in high schools. Some major challenges that students encounter include students’ ability to maintain academic integrity practices in their studies, to comprehend complex academic texts to outline key ideas, and to communicate confidently and effectively in diverse <b>academic</b> <b>genres.</b> As these challenges are common, often universities offer activities to assist students’ with their academic enculturation process. The three popular literacy teaching models currently in practice are the generic, embedded and literacies models. All the three models offer challenges in their effective practice. By evaluating the ethnographic data from the models used at UNSW Canberra Academic Language Learning Unit (ALL), this paper argues that in line with Lea and Street’s (2006) discussion, literacies is the most effective approach for developing students’ lifelong skills for effective communication, reading and critical thinking. Literary teaching should involve an advanced inquiry into writing practices in diverse disciplines helping students’ identifying and practicing using language devices and rhetorical structures in <b>academic</b> <b>genres...</b>|$|E

2500|$|In 1901, whilst in Rome, Modigliani {{admired the}} work of Domenico Morelli, a painter of {{dramatic}} religious and literary scenes.

40|$|Literature of {{academic}} writing within the genre theory and English for academic purposes (EAP) reveals that student academic writing is less researched {{compared to the}} research conducted on expert writing (e. g., Swales, 1990, Hyland, 2000). Research on student writing in business studiesseems to be particularly scarce in the literature. Previous studies have only classified <b>academic</b> <b>genres</b> business students produce in the academy (e. g., Canseco & Byrd, 1989, Cooper & Bikowski, 2007) into broader labels such as library research papers, article reviews, business reports, etc. Although this broad labelling is a good step in mapping the type of writing {{students are asked to}} produce in university settings, it seems, however, that we still need more studies that go beyond the mere labelling of the student-produced <b>academic</b> <b>genres</b> and try to investigate the various socio-contextual factors underlying the production of these genres. The present study therefore attempts to go in this direction. In this paper, I will report on results obtained from a qualitative interview-based study on a Master’s level student writing in the Accounting and Finance programme at the Essex School of Accounting, Finance and Management. Three compulsory courses on the programme were the focus of the investigation. The paper will try to answer the following three research questions: (I) what types of writing are students asked to produce on the accounting and finance programme? (II) i...|$|E
30|$|The {{first issue}} to be {{investigated}} consists of what the prototypical incidence of ideational grammatical metaphors across different <b>academic</b> <b>genres</b> is, namely question-and-answer and essay, {{and whether or not}} there may be inherent differences between text genres within such a parameter. Our primary aim here is to contrast two comparable subsets of texts drawn from the CLAE: Mexican vs. Californian question-and-answer documents. This would allow for the identification of how abstract and compact the question-and-answer genre produced in a bilingual (Spanish-English) context is compared to the homologous genre produced in the monolingual—that is, Spanish-only—setting of Mexico.|$|E

The objective of this AMS model is to help teachers design genres that may be used in the language classroom. This genre analysis can be performed with software tools for corpus analysis. This study is based on a previous model of genre analysis designed to determine the forms of the macrostructure, microstructure, and the format of the target genre (Casañ-Pitarch, 2015) and focuses on ESP students at tertiary education. The AMS model is expected to help students improve their writing skills and gain specific knowledge on professional and <b>academic</b> <b>genres...</b>|$|E
