For near Earth orbits, the error in the modeled field direction may vary from 0.5 degrees near the Equator to 3 degrees near the magnetic poles, where erratic auroral currents play a large role.

50|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{was designed}} to be three-axis stabilized, including during the firing of the Star 48B solid rocket motor (SRM) used to place it into orbit around Venus. Prior to Magellan, all spacecraft SRM firings had involved spinning spacecraft, which made control of the SRM a much easier task. In a typical spin mode, any unwanted forces related to SRM or nozzle mis-alignments are cancelled out. In the case of Magellan, the spacecraft design did not lend itself to spinning, so the resulting propulsion system design had to accommodate the challenging control issues with the large Star 48B SRM. The Star 48B, containing 2,014 kg of solid propellant, developed a thrust of ~89,000 Newton (20,000 lbf) shortly after firing; therefore, even a 0.5% SRM <b>alignment</b> <b>error</b> could generate side forces of 445 N (100 lbf).

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{currently}} {{no way to}} verify {{the quality of a}} multiple sequence alignment that is independent of the assumptions used to build it. Sequence alignments are typically evaluated by a number of established criteria: sequence conservation, the number of aligned residues, the frequency of gaps, and the probable correct gap placement. Covariation analysis is used to find putatively important residue pairs in a sequence alignment. Different alignments of the same protein family give different results demonstrating that covariation depends {{on the quality of the}} sequence alignment. We thus hypothesized that current criteria are insufficient to build alignments for use with covariation analyses. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show that current criteria are insufficient to build alignments for use with covariation analyses as systematic sequence <b>alignment</b> <b>errors</b> are present even in hand-curated structure-based alignment datasets like those from the Conserved Domain Database. We show that current non-parametric covariation statistics are sensitive to sequence misalignments and that this sensitivity can be used to identify systematic <b>alignment</b> <b>errors.</b> We demonstrate that removing <b>alignment</b> <b>errors</b> due to 1) improper structure alignment, 2) the presence of paralogous sequences, and 3) partial or otherwise erroneous sequences, improves contact prediction by covariation analysis. Finally we describe two non-parametric covariation statistics that are less sensitive to sequence <b>alignment</b> <b>errors</b> than those described previously in the literature. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Protein <b>alignments</b> with <b>errors</b> lead to false positive and false negative conclusions (incorrect assignment of covariation and conservation, respectively). Covariation analysis can provide a verification step, independent of traditional criteria, to identify systematic misalignments in protein alignments. Two non-parametric statistics are shown to be somewhat insensitive to misalignment errors, providing increased confidence in contact prediction when analyzing alignments with erroneous regions because of an emphasis on they emphasize pairwise covariation over group covariation...|$|R
5000|$|A {{paper by}} Hopkins proposes {{a method for}} which the fish may navigate. The fish is trying to reduce its {{alignment}} [...] "error", meaning {{it is trying to}} stay as parallel as it can with the electric field and reduce the angular difference between the electric field and the angle of its body. The equation to describe this orientation is ξh= ϕE-ϕF. ϕE represents the angle of the electric field. ϕF represents the angle of the fish, taken from three body segments as the fish bends. ξh represents the error angle, which is how far off the fish is from being parallel with the field(. When the fish is parallel with the field, ξh =0. Since the electric field does not stay parallel (the fish follows a curve path from positive to negative changes), the fish with stray off the path and have an <b>alignment</b> <b>error</b> ξh. The fish will then adjust β, its bend angle, to turn toward the electric field and reorient itself parallel with the field. A negative β means the fish turns to the right, and a positive β means a fish turns toward the left.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: There are {{two phases}} to the polar {{alignment}} problem. First one must quantify the <b>alignment</b> <b>error</b> for each axis. Once <b>alignment</b> <b>error</b> is known the mount must {{be adjusted to}} correct for this error. Often the adjustment amount must be estimated based on {{the magnitude of the}} error. This is primarily {{due to the fact that}} most mount manufacturers do not provide or calibrate the altitude and azimuth axes with high precision scales. This article will show a simple method utilizing a calculated star offset position to make the mount adjustment. The star offset position is calculated based on the known celestial coordinates of a reference star and the <b>alignment</b> <b>error</b> such that pointing the telescope at this coordinate and adjusting the mount to recenter the reference star will bring the mount into close alignment. This method is called “star offset positioning ” and should greatly reduce the amount of time to perform the alignment procedure. Overview In Measuring Polar Axis <b>Alignment</b> <b>Error</b> [1] we discussed various methods to measure the polar <b>alignment</b> <b>error.</b> If the mount were designed with encoders on the altitude and azimuth adjustment axes, or if these were calibrated with an accurate visual scale, the adjustment to th...|$|E

40|$|This paper focuses the {{attention}} on the possibility to describe and predict the positioning error of the end-effector (or tool-holder) of a Cartesian boring machine. The aim {{of the work is}} i) to build a deterministic expression of the positioning error, starting from independent measurements of linear and angular errors for each independent axis, and ii) to investigate the precision enhancement, which may eventually be achieved by implementing such deterministic error-prediction into the numerical control of the boring machine. The six components of the end-effector positioning error are expressed {{on the basis of a}} symbolic analysis of the kinematic linkages, which represents the machine layout. Each component results as a function of the command position, some environmental parameters (mainly the ambient temperature), and <b>alignment</b> <b>errors</b> for each axis. In particular, <b>alignment</b> <b>errors</b> may be expressed as six functions of position for each axis: three position errors and three angular errors [1, 2]. An accurate measurement of these errors (which may take place either on-line or at regular time schedule as a result of an auto-diagnosis procedure) allows expressing the end-effector positioning error as a deterministic vector field in the whole machine working space. Beside these considerations, the paper investigates the applicability of different techniques allowing the measurement of axes <b>alignment</b> <b>errors...</b>|$|R

Early investigations found children exhibited a wide range of <b>alignment</b> <b>errors,</b> which reduced as they matured. These studies used a mechanical Rod and Frame system, and presented only mean values of grouped data. The current study also considered changes in individual performance. Changes in rod alignment accuracy in 419 school children were measured using a computer-based Rod and Frame test. Each child was tested at school Grade 2 and retested in Grades 4 and 6. The results confirmed that children displayed a wide range of <b>alignment</b> <b>errors,</b> which decreased with age but did not reach the expected adult values. Although most children showed a decrease in frame dependency over the 4 years of the study, almost 20 % had increased <b>alignment</b> <b>errors</b> suggesting that they were becoming more frame-dependent. Plots of individual variation (SD) against mean error allowed the sample to be divided into 4 groups; the majority with small errors and SDs; a group with small SDs, but alignments clustering around the frame angle of 18 °; a group showing large errors in the opposite direction to the frame tilt; and a small number with large SDs whose alignment appeared to be random. The errors in the last 3 groups could largely be explained by alignment of the rod to different aspects of the frame. At corresponding ages females exhibited larger <b>alignment</b> <b>errors</b> than males although this did not reach statistical significance. This study confirms that children rely more heavily on the visual frame of reference for processing spatial orientation cues.

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{studied for}} decades, {{effective}} face recognition remains difficult to accomplish {{on account of}} occlusions and pose and illumination variations. Pose variance is a particular challenge in face recognition. Effective local descriptors have been proposed for frontal face recognition. When these descriptors are directly applied to cross-pose face recognition, the performance significantly decreases. To improve the descriptor performance for cross-pose face recognition, we propose a face recognition algorithm based on multiple virtual views and <b>alignment</b> <b>error.</b> First, warps between poses are learned using the Lucas–Kanade algorithm. Based on these warps, multiple virtual profile views are generated from a single frontal face, which enables non-frontal faces to be matched using the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm. Furthermore, warps indicate the correspondence between patches of two faces. A two-phase <b>alignment</b> <b>error</b> is proposed to obtain accurate warps, which contain pose alignment and individual alignment. Correlations between patches are considered to calculate the <b>alignment</b> <b>error</b> of two faces. Finally, a hybrid similarity between two faces is calculated; it combines the number of matched keypoints from SIFT and the <b>alignment</b> <b>error.</b> Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves better recognition accuracy than existing algorithms, even when the pose difference angle was greater than 30 °...|$|E
