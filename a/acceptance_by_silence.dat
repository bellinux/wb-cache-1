40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{some simple}} and natural restrictions of regulated pushdown automata. Most importantly, it studies one-turn regulated pushdown automata and proves that they characterize {{the family of}} recursively enumerable languages. In fact, this characterization holds even for atomic one-turn regulated pushdown automata of a reduced size. This result is established in terms of <b>acceptance</b> <b>by</b> final state and empty pushdown, <b>acceptance</b> <b>by</b> final state, and <b>acceptance</b> <b>by</b> empty pushdown...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{suggests}} a new investigation {{area of the}} formal language theory—regulated automata. Specifically, it investigates pushdown automata that regulate {{the use of their}} rules by control languages. It proves that this regulation has no effect on the power of pushdown automata if the control languages are regular. However, the pushdown automata regulated by linear control languages characterize the family of recursively enumerable languages. All these results are established in terms of (A) <b>acceptance</b> <b>by</b> final state, (B) <b>acceptance</b> <b>by</b> empty pushdown, and (C) <b>acceptance</b> <b>by</b> final state and empty pushdown. In its conclusion, this paper formulates several open problems...|$|R
