5|$|Ammianus {{is silent}} about archers on the Alamanni side. The Germans almost {{certainly}} did not have mounted archers, as this was an <b>arm</b> <b>that</b> evolved in the East and in any case, their longbows are unsuitable for use on horseback. As for the infantry, the archery capability of the Rhine Germans has traditionally been seen as negligible, due to the 6th-century writer Agathias's comment that the Franks {{did not know how}} to use bows. But this is contradicted by the archaeological record and by Ammianus himself in other parts of his account. It is virtually certain that there were a significant number of Alamanni foot archers at Strasbourg.|$|E

5|$|Another feud {{created for}} Over the Edge {{involved}} Triple H and The Rock, who would {{meet each other}} in a standard singles match at the event. Triple H had interfered in one of The Rock's matches, and later threw him off the stage. The script called for The Rock to portray an injury to his <b>arm</b> <b>that</b> required him to wear a plaster cast. Shane, acting his role as co-owner of WWF and ally of Triple H, further aggrieved The Rock by forbidding him to wear the cast for Over the Edge.|$|E
5|$|The {{reflector}} sight mechanism {{was mounted}} {{in front of}} the gyro, slightly to the left. A metal flap protected the half-mirror from damage when stowed, which was rotated rearward during use, covering the spirit level. The collimator was mounted on a prominent <b>arm</b> <b>that</b> projected above and {{in front of the}} sight when in use, and folded forward when stored. Electrical power was provided to light the collimator as well as the drift scale, which indicated the angle to fly to correct for the wind drift.|$|E
5|$|Anne learns {{from an old}} friend, Mrs. Smith (Helen Schlesinger), that Mr. Elliot is {{bankrupt}} {{and only}} interested in marrying Anne to help ensure his inheritance from her father. Anne also is told that Mr. Elliot wishes to keep the baronet from possibly marrying Mrs. Clay to produce a male heir. Soon after, Wentworth overhears Anne talking with Captain Harville about the constancy of a woman's love, and writes her a letter declaring that he still cares for her. Anne quickly finds him and the two happily walk off down a street, arm in <b>arm.</b> <b>That</b> night at a party, Wentworth announces his intention to marry Anne, much to Mr. Elliot's consternation. The final scene shows Wentworth and Anne on a naval ship, happy to be together.|$|E

5|$|There are no extant written {{records of}} the make-up of the broader {{categories}} of soldiers and sailors, but since the Mary Rose carried some 300 longbows and several thousand arrows {{there had to be}} a considerable proportion of longbow archers. Examination of the skeletal remains has found that there was a disproportionate number of men with a condition known as os acromiale, affecting their shoulder blades. This condition is known among modern elite archery athletes and is caused by placing considerable stress on the arm and shoulder muscles, particularly of the left <b>arm</b> <b>that</b> is used to hold the bow to brace against the pull on the bowstring. Among the men who died on the ship it was likely that some had practised using the longbow since childhood, and served on board as specialist archers.|$|E
5|$|An osteological {{examination}} of the bones showed them to be in generally good condition and largely complete except for the missing feet, {{which may have been}} destroyed by Victorian building work. It was immediately apparent that the body had suffered major injuries, and further evidence of wounds was found as the skeleton was cleaned. The skull shows signs of two lethal injuries; the base {{of the back of the}} skull had been completely cut away by a bladed weapon, which would have exposed the brain, and another bladed weapon had been thrust through the right side of the skull, striking the inside of the left side through the brain. Elsewhere on the skull, a blow from a pointed weapon had penetrated the crown of the head. Bladed weapons had clipped the skull and sheared off layers of bone, without penetrating it. Other holes in the skull and lower jaw were found to be consistent with dagger wounds to the chin and cheek. The multiple wounds on the king’s skull indicated that he was not wearing his helmet, which he may have removed or lost when he was on foot after his horse had become stuck in the marsh. One of his right ribs had been cut by a sharp implement, as had the pelvis. There was no evidence of the withered <b>arm</b> <b>that</b> afflicted the character in William Shakespeare's play Richard III.|$|E
5|$|For the 1979 season, Youngblood had {{a career-high}} 18 sacks {{and was a}} {{consensus}} first-team All-Pro for the fifth time. He was voted to his seventh consecutive Pro Bowl. In 1980, he was second-team All-Pro and first-team All-NFC while leading the Rams with 11½ sacks. In 1981, Youngblood led the Rams with 12½ sacks and was the Rams outstanding defensive lineman. In the off-season, prior to the 1981 season, Jack had emergency surgery to remove a hot-dog sized blood clot from under his left arm. It {{was a result of}} repeated trauma to a nerve in his <b>arm</b> <b>that</b> blocked the flow of blood. Despite the broken leg and numerous other injuries, Youngblood played in 201 consecutive games, a Rams team record; and only missed one game in his 14-year NFL career. He played in seven straight Pro Bowls, five NFC Championships, and one Super Bowl. He was also the Rams' defensive captain from 1977 through 1984 and was voted the Dan Reeves award 3 times, which is awarded to the team's MVP. He had 151½ career sacks and led the Rams in sacks nine times despite playing first in assistant Coach Ray Malavasi's stop-the-run-first defensive scheme and then in his final two seasons in Defensive Coordinator Fritz Shurmur's 3-4 two-gap scheme which limited some pass rush opportunities to make sure the opponent's running game was handled.|$|E

5|$|MacLachlan {{reported}} to No. 1 Depot, RAF Uxbridge {{and two days}} later attended No. 2 Central Medical Board on 13 August. He was certified fit to fly and flew Supermarine Spitfire on 21 August. He moved to Bournemouth to see his brother Gordon who was now a pilot officer in No. 501 Squadron RAF. At Queen Mary's Hospital he was fitted with a new arm. MacLachlan explained to the doctors that he required an <b>arm</b> <b>that</b> {{would allow him to}} fly a Hurricane. They designed a limb that allowed him to operate the throttle while taking the control column and firing button with his right hand. They spent hours studying the cockpit layout. The medical staff produced an arm with four spring-loaded pins, like fingers, which enabled him to use the controls on the port side of the cockpit. They secured his left arm to the levers of the throttle quadrant: throttle, propeller pitch control, supercharger and mixture control. The landing gear controls were located on the right side. The artificial arm had to interact with the control column while the gear was being retracted or lowered. His new arm proved sufficient and in September 1941 he flew as many hours in Hurricanes as possible, though not without incident. On 7 September 1941 he force-landed in darkness during a searchlight co-operation exercise. On 28 September 1941 he nearly collided with a Bristol Blenheim in low-cloud. Nevertheless, he was cleared for operational flying on 15 October.|$|E
