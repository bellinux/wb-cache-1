5|$|Apart {{from the}} dignitaries {{who lived in}} Chadderton's manor houses, Chadderton's {{population}} during the Middle Ages comprised a small community of retainers, {{most of whom were}} occupied in farming, either growing <b>and</b> <b>milling</b> of grain and cereal or raising cattle, sheep, pigs and domestic fowl. Workers supplemented their incomes by hand-loom spinning and weaving of wool at home. The community was ravaged by an outbreak of the Black Death in 1646.|$|E
5|$|In New River, Cooley {{sustained}} {{himself as}} a salvager and farmer, cultivating <b>and</b> <b>milling</b> arrowroot. His fortune and influence grew: {{he became the first}} lawman and judge in the settlement, besides being a land appraiser. Local Indians held him responsible for what they saw as a misjudgment involving the murder of one of their chiefs, and attacked the settlement in revenge on January 4, 1836.|$|E

5|$|During the Middle Ages, the small, {{scattered}} {{community in}} and around Milnrow was primarily agrarian, with the growing <b>and</b> <b>milling</b> of grain and cereal being the main labour of the people. Dry ironstone smelting was introduced into Milnrow {{at a very early}} time as evidenced from ancient kilns found at Tunshill. A chantry was constructed in the year 1400 by the Byrons—the then Lords of the Manor—and a chapel for the wider community in 1496; A document dated 20 March 1496, during the reign of Henry VII, proclaims that open land by the River Beal would be the site of the new chapel.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{promptly}} {{responded by}} ordering a counter-attack by the cuirassier brigades of Farine and Travers and Jaquinot's two Chevau-léger (lancer) regiments in the I Corps light cavalry division. Disorganized <b>and</b> <b>milling</b> about {{the bottom of}} the valley between Hougoumont and La Belle Alliance, the Scots Greys {{and the rest of the}} British heavy cavalry were taken by surprise by the countercharge of Milhaud's cuirassiers, joined by lancers from Baron Jaquinot's 1st Cavalry Division.|$|E
5|$|Sometime {{prior to}} 1762, Scott's older brother, John, died, leaving Scott to inherit his father's land near the James River and Muddy Creek. Having left the army, he had settled on his {{inherited}} farm by late 1761. On February 25, 1762, he married Frances Sweeney from Cumberland County, Virginia. With {{the help of}} approximately 10 slaves, Scott engaged in growing tobacco <b>and</b> <b>milling</b> flour on his farm. In July 1766, he was named one of two captains in the local militia. Over the next several years, Scott {{and his wife had}} four boys and four or five girls.|$|E

5|$|Stuart Lake {{described}} {{in his book}} how Earp single-handedly stood down a large crowd that wanted to lynch gambler Michael O'Rourke (Johnny Behind the Deuce). O'Rourke had killed Henry Schneider, chief engineer of the Tombstone Mining <b>and</b> <b>Milling</b> Company—he said in self defense. Henry was well-liked, and a mob of miners quickly gathered, threatening to lynch O'Rourke on the spot. In fact, the Epitaph gave primary credit to Ben Sippy for standing down the crowd, assisted by Virgil Earp, Wyatt Earp, and Johnny Behan. This incident as described by Lake added to Earp's modern legend as a lawman.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Industrial Revolution, Northern England had plentiful coal and water power while the poor agriculture in the uplands meant that labour in the area was cheap. Mining <b>and</b> <b>milling,</b> which had been practiced on a small scale in the area for generations, began to grow and centralise. The boom in industrial textile manufacture is sometimes attributed to the damp climate and soft water making it easier to wash and work fibres, although the success of Northern fabric mills has no single clear source. Readily available coal and the discovery of large iron deposits in Cumbria and Cleveland allowed ironmaking and, with the invention of the Bessemer process, steelmaking to take root in the region. High quality steel in turn fed the shipyards that opened along the coasts, especially on Tyneside and at Barrow-in-Furness.|$|E
5|$|In late 2015 Main Roads {{completed}} a planning review for an upgrade {{of the highway}} between Muchea and Wubin. Known as Muchea to Wubin Stage 2 Upgrade, the project continues work undertaken on this section from 2000 to improve the road to National Highway standards. Several bypasses, realignments, and other improvements have been planned at or near Muchea, Bindoon, New Norcia, Walebing, Miling, Pithara, Dalwallinu, Nugadong, and Wubin. Sections near Bindi Bindi and Batty Bog, completed in 2015, {{were included in the}} review. The highest priority works are scheduled to be completed between 2016 and 2019. These include the New Norcia Bypass, Milling Straight section, Muchea North section (designed to link to the NorthLink WA project), <b>and</b> <b>Milling</b> Bypass. , designs are being finalised for the Walebing Curve, Dalwallinu Bypass, Nugadong, and Wubin Bypass section, while funding has not been confirmed for the Bindoon upgrades.|$|E

5|$|The {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (EDM) or spark erosion process has become widely used in mould making. As well as allowing the formation of shapes {{that are difficult to}} machine, the process allows pre-hardened moulds to be shaped so that no heat treatment is required. Changes to a hardened mould by conventional drilling <b>and</b> <b>milling</b> normally require annealing to soften the mould, followed by heat treatment to harden it again. EDM is a simple process in which a shaped electrode, usually made of copper or graphite, is very slowly lowered onto the mould surface (over a period of many hours), which is immersed in paraffin oil (kerosene). A voltage applied between tool and mould causes spark erosion of the mould surface in the inverse shape of the electrode.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} the overall {{adequacy}} of its uranium reserves, Indian power plants could not get the necessary amount of uranium to function at full capacity in the late 2000s, primarily due to inadequate investments made in the uranium mining <b>and</b> <b>milling</b> capacity resulting from fiscal austerity in the early 1990s.|$|E

25|$|Alcohol-precipitated pectin is then separated, {{washed and}} dried. Treating the initial pectin with dilute acid leads to low-esterified pectins. When this process {{includes}} ammonium hydroxide, amidated pectins are obtained. After drying <b>and</b> <b>milling,</b> pectin is usually standardised with sugar and sometimes calcium salts or organic acids to have optimum {{performance in a}} particular application.|$|E
25|$|Uranium mining is {{the process}} of {{extraction}} of uranium ore from the ground. The worldwide production of uranium in 2009 amounted to 50,572 tonnes. Kazakhstan, Canada, and Australia are the top three producers and together account for 63% of world uranium production. A prominent use of uranium from mining is as fuel for nuclear power plants. The mining <b>and</b> <b>milling</b> of uranium present significant dangers to the environment.|$|E
25|$|While {{much of its}} {{route is}} rural, its course through Worksop is man made, a result of {{development}} <b>and</b> <b>milling.</b> It used to flow through Scrooby, {{where there was a}} mill, but was diverted northwards in the 1960s. It supplies water to the Chesterfield Canal through two feeders, and a number of the bridges which cross it are of interest architecturally, which has resulted in them becoming Listed structures.|$|E

25|$|Although {{a mining}} <b>and</b> <b>milling</b> plant was {{constructed}} on the mine site before Beanland went into operation, {{there is no}} record of production. The entire plant was still in existence until at least the 1940s. It is now largely demolished; foundations, the 150horsepower boiler and part of the Ingersoll-Rand Imperial Type 10air compressor are all that remains of the plant. Much of the waste rock was dumped just northeast of the shaft near a small wetland.|$|E
25|$|The {{particle}} size distribution of milled coal depends partly on the rank of the coal, which determines its brittleness, and on the handling, crushing <b>and</b> <b>milling</b> it has undergone. Generally coal is utilised in furnaces and coking ovens at a certain size, so the crushability of the coal must be determined and its behaviour quantified. It is necessary to know these data before coal is mined, so that suitable crushing machinery can be designed to optimise the {{particle size}} for transport and use.|$|E
