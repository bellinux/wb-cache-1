5|$|According to Swedish legend, Charles XI {{travelled}} {{around the}} country dressed as a farmer or simple traveller. In the legend he {{is referred to as}} the Greycoat (Swedish: Gråkappan). This was done to discover <b>and</b> <b>identify</b> corruption and oppression against the populace. There are many stories about him arriving in villages looking for corrupt church officials and sending them to the gallows. However, Charles XI never travelled alone. He was always followed by a military cortège but he was one of the kings in Sweden during this era that travelled the most throughout the country. The stories of the Greycoat were published in a book by Arvid August Afzelius in the middle of the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|At the CFM Mortuary, {{the family}} will view <b>and</b> <b>identify</b> {{the body of the}} {{deceased}} {{in the presence of a}} coroner, who reviews the case and determines if an autopsy is required.

If an autopsy is conducted and reveals that the death is unnatural, the police will conduct further investigations into the cause of death with the family's assistance. Once the investigations are complete, {{the family will}} be told to attend a coroner's inquiry at the Subordinate Courts. Only after that will they be able to claim the body.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} find new {{actinomycete}} resources for discovering new drug leads, the actinomycete associated with lichens was studied. Three species of lichen samples were collected from 3 locations of Yunnan. Actinomycetes in the samples were isolated with 11 media, <b>and</b> <b>identified</b> with 16 S rRNA gene sequence procedures. Bacteria {{of two of the}} three species were sequenced by using 454 pyrosequencing. The results of both pure culture and 454 pyrosequencing were analyzed and compared. Anti-microbial activities of pure cultural strains were determined with agar diffusion methods. 17 genera of actinobacteria were isolated <b>and</b> <b>identified</b> from Lepraria yunnaniana, and 10 genera of them were exclusive. 12 genera were isolated <b>and</b> <b>identified</b> from Punctelia borreria, and 4 genera of them were exclusive. 11 genera were isolated <b>and</b> <b>identified</b> from Parmotrema austrosinense, and 5 genera were exclusive. Total 28 genera were isolated <b>and</b> <b>identified</b> from the three lichens. Streptomyces, Rhodococcus and Nocardia were distributed widely in the three species of lichens. The results from 454 pyrosequencing reveale...|$|R

The completion of some tasks is reflected in the Gotham City Police Department, with thugs and supervillains becoming incarcerated, and criminal memorabilia from missions and previous games being collected in the evidence room.|$|E
5|$|Culture {{techniques}} {{are designed to}} promote the growth <b>and</b> <b>identify</b> particular bacteria, while restricting {{the growth of the}} other bacteria in the sample. Often these {{techniques are}} designed for specific specimens; for example, a sputum sample will be treated to identify organisms that cause pneumonia, while stool specimens are cultured on selective media to identify organisms that cause diarrhoea, while preventing growth of non-pathogenic bacteria. Specimens that are normally sterile, such as blood, urine or spinal fluid, are cultured under conditions designed to grow all possible organisms. Once a pathogenic organism has been isolated, it can be further characterised by its morphology, growth patterns (such as aerobic or anaerobic growth), patterns of hemolysis, and staining.|$|E
5|$|Note, while column {{triplets}} {{are used}} to construct <b>and</b> <b>identify</b> the equivalence classes, the class members themselves are the valid Band1 permutations: class size (Sb.z) reflects column triplet permutations compatible with the One Rule solution requirements. Counting symmetry is a completion property and applies only to a partial grid (band or stack). Solution symmetry for preserving solutions {{can be applied to}} either partial grids (bands, stacks) or full grid solutions. Lastly note, counting symmetry is more restrictive than simple numeric completion count equality: two (distinct) bands belong to the same counting symmetry equivalence class only if they impose equivalent completion constraints.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers felt {{part of the}} failings laid {{with the}} {{underdeveloped}} characters despite them being slightly different from usual anime stock characters. The story neither properly introduces them nor explains their backgrounds and motivations, making them hard to identify with. Eko's menace only came by force and not by his personality or schemes, making him a weak villain. DVD Talk {{found it hard to}} piece together the relationship between the main characters, but acknowledged the later half addressed some of these issues by revealing the background of some characters. They felt the revelations fleshed out Otoha's personality and motivation, helping viewers to sympathize <b>and</b> <b>identify</b> with the protagonist.|$|E
5|$|The 2015 Malaysian Census {{reported}} {{the population of}} Sabah at 3,543,500, being the third most populous state in Malaysia and have the highest non-citizens population at 870,400.

People from Sabah are generally called Sabahans <b>and</b> <b>identify</b> themselves as such. There is an estimate of 42 ethnic groups with over 200 sub-ethnic groups with their own language, culture and beliefs which predicted to be increase more in the future due to high interracial marriage and recent migration.|$|E
5|$|The DU {{spectrophotometer}} or Beckman DU, {{introduced in}} 1941, {{was the first}} commercially viable scientific instrument for measuring the amount of ultraviolet light absorbed by a substance. This model of spectrophotometer enabled scientists to easily examine <b>and</b> <b>identify</b> a given substance based on its absorption spectrum, the pattern of light absorbed at different wavelengths. Arnold O. Beckman's National Technical Laboratories (later Beckman Instruments) developed three in-house prototype models (A, B, C) and one limited distribution model (D) before moving to full commercial production with the DU. Approximately 30,000 DU spectrophotometers were manufactured and sold between 1941 and 1976.|$|E

The Family Department has recently implemented a quality control-like program titled Measure of Efforts and Results System, which evaluates the quality and promptitude of services while reviewing various eligibility elements, to improve customer services and program management. The Department has also agreed to switch from a biennial audit to an annual Single Audit, and subject the program to periodic audits by its Administration for Socio-Economic Development, to detect and correct problems more quickly. Furthermore, the USDA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) has performed regular audits to assure compliance <b>and</b> <b>identify</b> areas for improvement.|$|E

5|$|The hybrid {{program has}} been criticized, with one of Sulimov's colleagues {{pointing}} out that in other tests the Laika performed {{just as well as}} the jackal hybrids. The assumption that dogs have lost some of their scent-detection ability may be incorrect, in that dogs {{need to be able to}} scent-detect <b>and</b> <b>identify</b> the many humans that they come into contact with in their domesticated environment. Another researcher crossed German Shepherds with wolves and claimed that this hybrid had superior scent-detection abilities. The scientific evidence to support the claims of hybrid researchers is minimal, and more research has been called for.|$|E
