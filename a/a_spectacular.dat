5|$|After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871, {{during which}} Bizet {{served in the}} National Guard, he had little success with his one-act opera Djamileh, though an orchestral suite derived from his {{incidental}} music to Alphonse Daudet's play L'Arlésienne was instantly popular. The production of Bizet's final opera, Carmen, was delayed because of fears that its themes of betrayal and murder would offend audiences. After its premiere on 3 March 1875, Bizet {{was convinced that the}} work was a failure; he {{died of a heart attack}} three months later, unaware that it would prove <b>a</b> <b>spectacular</b> and enduring success.|$|E
5|$|As {{it passed}} {{perihelion}} on April 1, 1997 the comet developed into <b>a</b> <b>spectacular</b> sight. It shone brighter than any {{star in the}} sky except Sirius, and its dust tail stretched 40–45 degrees across the sky. The comet was visible well before the sky got fully dark each night, and while many great comets {{are very close to}} the Sun as they pass perihelion, comet Hale–Bopp was visible all night to northern hemisphere observers.|$|E

The collapse of the walls was a consequence of the instability of the topsoil on top of the limestone spur, which was a mixture of clay and sandstone; once the clay was washed away over time, the remaining sandstone proved extremely unstable and liable to crack.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{have also}} {{adversely}} impacted {{the ecology of}} the Everglades by introducing numerous invasive species, which may prey on or compete with native species. <b>A</b> <b>spectacular</b> and particularly damaging example of this phenomenon is the recent proliferation of the Burmese python in the Everglades, as well as elsewhere in Florida. First observed in the wild in 1979 and not again until 1995, they have increased alarmingly since 2000. By 2011, decreases of 87.5%, 94.1%, 98.9% and 99.3% in sightings of bobcats, white-tailed deer, opossums and raccoons, respectively, were reported in park road surveys, while rabbits were no longer being seen at all.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 Ole Lippman, {{leader of}} the Danish section of the Special Operations Executive, invited the British Royal Air Force to assist their {{operations}} by attacking Nazi headquarters in Copenhagen.

Hibs scored two early goals and progressed to the semi-final with a 2–0 victory. In the semi-final, Hibs took on Aberdeen at Hampden Park. Garry O'Connor scored an early goal, and Rory Fallon equalised for Aberdeen {{in the second half}} with <b>a</b> <b>spectacular</b> looping volley. Hibs won 2–1 thanks to a late winning goal by Leigh Griffiths.|$|E

Implantation of boron ions into metals and alloys, through ion implantation or ion beam deposition, results in <b>a</b> <b>spectacular</b> increase in surface resistance and microhardness.

5|$|Some {{have argued}} that the pyramids were laid out as a map of the three stars in the belt of Orion, {{although}} this theory has been criticized by reputable astronomers. The site was instead probably governed by <b>a</b> <b>spectacular</b> hierophany which occurs at the summer solstice, when the sun, viewed from the Sphinx terrace, forms - together with the two giant pyramids - the symbol Akhet, which was also the name of the Great Pyramid. Further, the south east corners of all the 3 pyramids align towards the temple of Heliopolis, as first discovered by the Egyptologist Mark Lehner.|$|E

After his marital infidelities came to light and received massive media coverage at the end of 2009 (see further details below), Woods announced in December that he would be taking an indefinite break from competitive golf. In February 2010, he delivered a televised apology for his behavior. During this period, several companies ended their endorsement deals with Woods.|$|E
5|$|After {{his final}} return to Northumbria Wilfrid retired to the monastery at Ripon, {{where he lived}} until his death {{during a visit to}} Oundle, at the age of 75. A little over a year before his death in either 709 or 710 Wilfrid {{suffered}} another stroke or seizure, which led him to make arrangements for the disposition of his monasteries and possessions. He was buried near the altar of his church in Ripon. Bede records the epitaph that was placed on the tomb. Wilfrid was succeeded at Hexham by Acca of Hexham, a protégé who had accompanied him to Rome in 703. The monastery at Ripon celebrated the first anniversary of Wilfrid's death with a commemoration service attended by all the abbots of his monasteries and <b>a</b> <b>spectacular</b> white arc was said to have appeared in the sky starting from the gables of the basilica where his bones were laid to rest.|$|E
