5|$|In 1969, when <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>chunk</b> {{of stone}} fell from a statue near the main door, it became {{apparent}} that there was an urgent need for restoration of the west front. Detailed studies of the stonework and of conservation practices were undertaken under the cathedral architect, Alban D. R. Caroe and a restoration committee formed. The methods that were selected for conservation were those devised by Eve and Robert Baker. W. A. (Bert) Wheeler, clerk of works to the cathedral 1935–1978, had previously experimented with washing and surface-treatment of architectural carvings on the building and his techniques were among those tried on the statues.|$|E
5|$|Heartland Food Corporation (Heartland) {{came into}} {{existence}} when Miami-based franchisee Al Cabrera purchased <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>chunk</b> of stores, 130 locations primarily in the Chicago and the upper mid-west, from the failed franchise AmeriKing for a bargain basement price of $16million, or approximately 88% of their original value in December 2003. Taking these stores, he and his partners created a new company called Core Value Partners to renovate and update the locations which had deteriorated during Ameriking's decline. During this time, the company was renamed Heartland Food Corp. and it purchased 120 additional stores from other financially distressed owners and completely revamped them as well. The resulting purchases made Mr. Cabrerra Burger King's largest minority franchisee and Heartland one of BKC's top franchisee groups at the time. By 2006, the company was valued at over $150million, and was sold to New York-based GSO Capital Partners.|$|E

25|$|The {{reduction}} of {{power of the}} great families helped to improve the empire. This was because previously, each great family ruled <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>chunk</b> of land and each had their own king. The name Shahanshah, meaning King of Kings, derived {{from the fact that}} there were many feudal kings in Sasanian Persia with the Shahanshah as the ruler of them all. Their fall from power meant their control was redirected to the central government and all taxes now came to the central government rather than to the local nobility.|$|E
5000|$|This usage {{derives from}} Miller's (1956) idea of {{chunking}} as grouping, but {{the emphasis is}} now on long-term memory rather than only on short-term memory. A chunk can then be defined as [...] "a collection of elements having strong associations with one another, but weak associations with elements within other chunks" [...] (Gobet et al., 2001, p. 236). Chase and Simon (1973) and later Gobet, Retschitzki and de Voogt (2004) showed that chunking could explain several phenomena linked to expertise in chess. To be more specific, more skilled chess players have <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>chunk</b> size. Several successful computational models of learning and expertise have been developed using this idea, such as EPAM (Elementary Perceiver and Memorizer) and CHREST (Chunk Hierarchy and REtrieval STructures). Chunking has also been used with models of language acquisition (Barnard, Lieven, & Tomasello, 2009).|$|R

25|$|No more major land {{acquisitions}} {{took place}} until the 1960s, when the State Council of Parks, forerunner of NYSOPRHP, formed the temporary Hudson River Valley Study Committee {{to develop a}} comprehensive plan in response to increasing industrial interest in the area, exemplified by Consolidated Edison's proposal to excavate <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>chunk</b> of Storm King Mountain, across from Breakneck, for a hydroelectric plant, which would have involved running power lines across the river and into the eastern Highlands. In 1967 the state acquired the Little Stony Point property to prevent its development.|$|E
25|$|However, during Cannavaro's spell {{with the}} club, Inter mostly flattered to deceive. His stint {{with the club}} began promisingly, as Inter reached the semi-finals of the 2002–03 Champions League and also {{finished}} runners-up in Serie A to Juventus {{in his first season}} with the club. However, his second season was not as productive, and he missed <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>chunk</b> of it through injury. He was also often played out of position. Inter finished fourth in Serie A and reached the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia, losing out to Juventus on penalties. Inter finished third in their Champions League group, but would go on to reach the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup. After two years with the club, he was sold to Juventus in a surprising part-exchange deal, after just over 50 appearances and two goals. After he left Italy, Cannavaro often spoke negatively of his spell at Inter, comparing the club unfavourably with his other Italian clubs, Parma and Juventus.|$|E
25|$|As the {{defenders}} were running low on supplies, about 4,000 of starving auxiliaries (servants) requested {{to leave the}} city; they were granted permission, but soon after leaving the town walls they were taken captive by the Tatars; some were taken into jasyr while others were executed on spot. Despite that, others wanted to leave the town, but prince Wiśniowiecki promised to feed them rather than risk another massacre. The besiegers also tried to send messages to the king asking for reinforcements, and in early August a volunteer messenger, Mikołaj Skrzetuski, managed to sneak past the besiegers and reached the king around 6 or 7 August; he would later inspire the fictional character Jan Skrzetuski in Henryk Sienkiewicz's The Trilogy. In the meantime, the Cossack and Tatars would try to extend their fortifications closer to the defender's line; they launched their last large assault on 6 August, but were defeated once more. Soon afterward the Cossack and Tatar sent off <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>chunk</b> of their forces under Bohdan Khmelnytsky to intercept the nearing royal reinforcements under John II Casimir at Zboriv; the resulting battle ended in the Treaty of Zboriv of 17 August. In the meantime, at Zbarazh, the besiegers even managed to successfully dig a tunnel into the Polish-Lithuanian camp around 16 August, but it was destroyed by {{the defenders}}.|$|E

40|$|From {{the work}} of Morgan [M], {{we know that the}} {{fundamental}} group of a complex algebraic variety carries a mixed Hodge structure, which really means that a certain linearization of it does. This linearization, called the Malčev or pro-unipotent completion destroys the group completely in some cases; for example if it were perfect. So a natural question is whether can one give a Hodge structure on <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>chunk</b> of the fundamental group. There have been a couple of approaches to this. Work of Simpson [Si] continued by Kartzarkov, Pantev, Toen [KPT 1] has shown that one has a weak Hodge-like structure (essentially an action by C ∗ viewed as a discrete group) on the entire pro-algebraic completion of the fundamental group when the variety is smooth projective. Hain [H 2] refining his earlier work [H 1], has shown that a Hodge structure of a more conventional sort exists on the so called relative Malčev completions (under appropriate hypotheses). In this paper, I want to propose a third alternative. I define a quotient of the pro-algebraic completion called the Hodge theoretic fundamental group π hodge 1 (X, x) as the Tannaka dua...|$|R
25|$|Bird drew {{close to}} {{teammate}} Dillmann and overtook {{him for the}} lead exiting the final corner. Dillmann fought back against Bird driving towards the first turn and the two went alongside each other. The two made minor contact in turns one and two which enabled Coletti to get a run on Dillmann and passed him to move into second. On the next lap, Nasr went down the inside of Dillmann going into the first corner and the latter lost third to Nasr. Calado was overtaken by Palmer for seventh place on the fourth lap and then held off an attack from teammate Abt. The field settled down as drivers looked to conserve their tyres, and the top three pulled away from Dillmann. On the sixth lap, Bird came upon <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>chunk</b> of debris driving towards the first corner and locked his tyres {{in an attempt to}} avoid running over it. He appeared to escape unhindered and the debris was then removed by a trackside marshal. Further down the field, a battle for fifth place involved Quaife-Hobbs, Leimer and Palmer. By lap seven, one second covered the trio and Leimer looked for a way past Quaife-Hobbs but was cautious not to allow Palmer {{to take advantage of the}} situation. Further back, Berthon lost two positions after being overtaken by Evans and Leal.|$|E
25|$|Though Bermuda {{has been}} {{classified}} as a self-governed colony since 1620, internal self-government was bolstered by {{the establishment of a}} formal constitution in 1968, and the introduction of universal adult suffrage; debate about independence has ensued, although a 1995 independence referendum was soundly defeated. For many, Bermudian independence would mean little other than the obligation to staff foreign missions and embassies around the world, which would be a heavy obligation for Bermuda's small population, and the loss of British passports (which could severely restrict travel, as few enough countries have even heard of little Bermuda, and could regard travellers with suspicion). Another concern, which raised its head during the 1991 Gulf War, was the loss of the protection provided by the Royal Navy, especially, to the large number of merchant vessels on Bermuda's shipping register. The Bermuda government is unlikely to be able to provide naval protection to oil tankers plying the Persian Gulf, or other potentially dangerous waters. At present, Bermuda is {{able to take advantage of}} its status as part of the United Kingdom to attract overseas shipping operators to its register, although it does not contribute to the navy's budget. With independence, it was feared, <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>chunk</b> of the money currently flowing into the Bermuda Government's coffers would disappear. The current government is promoting independence – by means of a general election (that is, the government of the day would have the power to decide whether to go independent or not) as opposed to a referendum (a direct vote by the people) – by establishing a committee to investigate (though the committee is notably staffed with party members, and without representation by the opposition party). This stance is being supported by the UN, who have sent delegations to the island claiming that Bermuda is being suppressed by the British.|$|E

50|$|Public {{comment in}} some cases {{includes}} remarks from experts or public officials with some role in the issue at stake, but at a different time or level of process. Typically these kinds of comments may be ad hoc, not solicited by the governing agency which is conducting the hearing. There may be informal expectation that such a party may comment, {{but if it is}} an interested agency then there will be prior notification and <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>chunk</b> of time may be allowed to such presenters. Surprisingly, however, these knowledgeable high level speakers, including office holders, often are limited to the same time constriction and queing requirements as all other public commentors. They simply wait in line, their name is called when their speaker slip happens to come {{to the top of the}} pile, and they are subject to being cut off after their two minutes or three minutes are up.This equalization between expert and lay commentator is an example of social leveling which occurs in democratic process and which is often harshly criticized by elitist theorists such as Machiavellians, fascists, communist technocrats and other conservative social thinkers.|$|R
