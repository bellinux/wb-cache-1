Maleficent then appears and magically lures Aurora away from the fairies and tricks the princess into touching an enchanted spinning wheel. Aurora pricks her finger, completing the curse. The good fairies place Aurora on a bed in the highest tower and place a powerful spell on <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> kingdom, causing them to fall asleep until the spell on their princess is broken. While doing so, they overhear a conversation between King Stefan and King Hubert. From King Hubert's conversation with King Stefan, the fairies realize that Prince Phillip is the man with whom Aurora has fallen in love. They rush to find him, but he is kidnapped by Maleficent who is waiting {{for him at the}} cottage in the woods. She shows Phillip the peasant girl {{he fell in love with}} is the now-sleeping princess. She tells him she plans to keep him locked away until he's an old man on the verge of death, then release him to meet his love, who will not have aged a single day.|$|E

500|$|Staci Krause of IGN had a {{positive}} outlook on the episode, mainly due to the heavy development the episode's plot had in the season's progressive arc. She described the storylines involving the cancer patient's intoxication and Ellis' lucidity as achieving a balance, and moving the show [...] "at a lightning quick pace". Krause deemed the episode [...] "stellar", noting how it avoided the possibility of having negative points. Regarding the episode an [...] "epic" [...] one, she praised the scene which depicts O'Malley realizing the intoxication provoked by the patient's blood. [...] "This is what we come to expect from medical dramas and it is great to see Grey's get back to this, while not sacrificing the personal stories", stated Krause, putting the emphasis on how [...] "this case brought out the hore in just about everyone, pushing their limits for a patient". Krause noted that O'Malley has developed into a hero, stating that [...] "pulling <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> operating room out, {{even though he was}} already sick and could have easily died from the effort" [...] in a comparison to Sloan, described as being a man with no appealing traits and [...] "unlikable ways", which attracted criticism from Krause.|$|E

With the sporadic attacks from Dakkhinadesan forces slowly grinding down his power in the north, Manabharana left Polonnaruwa to attack a force commanded by Rakkha that had been wreaking havoc in western Rajarata.

50|$|The old {{concept of}} Natio Hungarica came {{to play a}} role in the {{development}} of early nationalism based on the French model.Ľudovít Štúr indirectly demanded that all people (including peasants) living in the Kingdom of Hungary have their own representatives in the Diet. He indicated thenew constitutional subject that is <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom of Hungary should become the Natio Hungarica. This involved the amendment of the meaning of the traditional class concept Natio Hungarica and the extension of its frame to <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hungarian Kingdom. His attempt at <b>the</b> transformation of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>in</b> kingdom into Natio Hungarica constituted an attempt at <b>the</b> transformation of <b>all</b> ethnic groups in Hungarian Kingdom into Natio Hungarica.Only with the abolition of nobility and the development of Hungarian nationalism did natio Hungarica begin to develop an ethnic sense.Lajos Kossuth identified the historical-political rights of king and corporations in the Kingdom of Hungary with the national rights of theMagyars.|$|R
2500|$|His perfectionism was legendary; however, his {{relentless}} {{insistence on}} rehearsals and retakes was {{a burden to}} some. When time approached for the shooting of a number, Astaire would rehearse for another two weeks and record the singing and music. With all the preparation completed, the actual shooting would go quickly, conserving costs. Astaire agonized during the entire process, frequently asking colleagues for acceptance for his work. As Vincente Minnelli stated, [...] "He lacks confidence to the most enormous degree of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world. He will not even go to see his rushes...

Mr Davidson cited the fact that a proportion of his act was aimed at disabled customers and that he would be unable to perform under these circumstances." [...] In a statement Davidson explained he [...] "took the mick" [...] out of everyone in the front row of his shows. [...] "As <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> front row were in wheelchairs I feared it would appear I was specifically targeting disabled people.

2500|$|Noting that [...] {{required}} the priests to offer 70 bulls over the {{seven days of}} Sukkot, Rabbi Eleazar taught that the 70 bulls correspond to the 70 nations of the world. And Rabbi Eleazar taught that the single bull that [...] {{required the}} priests to offer on Shemini Atzeret corresponds to the unique nation of Israel. Rabbi Eleazar compared this to a mortal king who told his servants to prepare a great banquet, but {{on the last day}} told his beloved friend to prepare a simple meal so that the king might enjoy his friend's company. Similarly, a Midrash taught that on Sukkot, the Israelites offered God 70 bulls as an atonement for the 70 nations. The Israelites then complained to God that they had offered 70 bulls on behalf of the nations of the world, and they ought thus to love Israel, but they still hated the Jews. As [...] says, [...] "In return for my love they are my adversaries." [...] So in [...] God told Israel to offer a single bull as sacrifice on its own behalf. And the Midrash compared this to the case of a king who made a banquet for seven days and invited <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> province. And when the seven days of the feast were over, he said to his friend that he had done his duty to all the people of the province, now the two of them would eat whatever the friend could find — a pound of meat, fish, or vegetables.|$|E
