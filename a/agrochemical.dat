Political parties have increasingly become sensitive to civil uprisings in rural electoral constituencies where State and Central government policies have failed to tackle widespread bureaucratic corruption, stem farmers' suicides and lower debt bondage.|$|E
25|$|Borlaug's name {{is nearly}} {{synonymous with the}} Green Revolution, against which many criticisms have been mounted over the decades by environmentalists and some nutritionalists. Throughout his years of research, Borlaug's {{programs}} often faced opposition by people who consider genetic crossbreeding to be unnatural or to have negative effects. Borlaug's work {{has been criticized for}} bringing large-scale monoculture, input-intensive farming techniques to countries that had previously relied on subsistence farming. These farming techniques often reap large profits for U.S. agribusiness and <b>agrochemical</b> corporations and have been criticized for widening social inequality in the countries owing to uneven food distribution while forcing a capitalist agenda of U.S. corporations onto countries that had undergone land reform.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Agrochemicals</b> were {{introduced}} to protect crops from pests and enhance crop yields. The most common <b>agrochemicals</b> include pesticides and fertilizers. Due to the adaptation of pests to these chemicals, more and new <b>agrochemicals</b> were being used, causing side effects in the environment. However, <b>agrochemicals</b> are not completely inefficient. According to the article, Agriculture, Pesticides, Food Security and Food Safety, written by Fernando P. Carvalho, chemical fertilizers in the 1960s {{were responsible for the}} beginning of the [...] "Green Revolution", where using the same surface of land using intensive irrigation and mineral fertilizers such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium has greatly increased food production. Throughout the 1970s through 1980s, pesticide research continued into producing more selective <b>agrochemicals.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of changes in prices and wages, which {{may be caused by}} trade liberalization, on the micro {{behavior}} of farmers, in particular, on the use of <b>agrochemicals</b> and part-time farming. I demonstrate that a small decrease in the price of an agricultural product decreases the use of <b>agrochemicals</b> if there are no arable land rental transactions. On the other hand, if a change in those transactions is taken into consideration, the price decrease may increase the use of <b>agrochemicals</b> in an rural area. Moreover, a small increase in the local wage decreases the use of <b>agrochemicals</b> in the area...|$|R
25|$|Liquid chromatography–mass {{spectrometry}} (LC-MS) is {{an analytical}} chemistry technique that combines the physical separation capabilities of liquid chromatography (or HPLC) with the mass analysis capabilities of mass spectrometry (MS). Coupled chromatography - MS systems are popular in chemical analysis because the individual capabilities of each technique are enhanced synergistically. While liquid chromatography separates mixtures with multiple components, mass spectrometry provides structural {{identity of the}} individual components with high molecular specificity and detection sensitivity. This tandem technique {{can be used to}} analyze biochemical, organic, and inorganic compounds commonly found in complex samples of environmental and biological origin. Therefore, LC-MS may be applied {{in a wide range of}} sectors including biotechnology, environment monitoring, food processing, and pharmaceutical, <b>agrochemical,</b> and cosmetic industries.|$|E
25|$|The BfR {{responded that}} IARC {{reviewed}} only {{a selection of}} what they had reviewed earlier, and argued that other studies, including a cohort study called Agricultural Health Study, do not support the classification. The IARC report did not include unpublished industry-funded studies, including one completed by the IARC panel leader, Aaron Blair, who stated that agency policy required that he not consider this study. The agency's international protocol dictates that only published studies be used in classifications of carcinogenicity, since national regulatory agencies including the EPA have allowed <b>agrochemical</b> corporations to conduct their own unpublished research, which may be biased in support of their profit motives. Monsanto called the IARC report biased and said it wanted it to be retracted. The corporation started a case against California's carcinogen classification in 2016, and lost the suit in March 2017.|$|E
25|$|The most {{productive}} cotton lands in Turkmenistan (the middle and lower Amu Darya and the Murgap oasis) receive {{as much as}} 250 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare, compared with the average application of thirty kilograms per hectare. Furthermore, most fertilizers are so poorly applied that experts have estimated that only 15 to 40% of the chemicals can be absorbed by cotton plants, while the remainder washes into the soil and subsequently into the groundwater. Cotton also uses far more pesticides and defoliants than other crops, and application of these chemicals often is mishandled by farmers. For example, local herdsmen, unaware {{of the danger of}} DDT, have reportedly mixed the pesticide with water and applied it to their faces to keep away mosquitoes. In the late 1980s, a drive began in Central Asia to reduce <b>agrochemical</b> usage. In Turkmenistan the campaign reduced fertilizer use 30% between 1988 and 1989. In the early 1990s, use of some pesticides and defoliants declined drastically because of the country's shortage of hard currency.|$|E
40|$|Tobacco {{cultivation}} {{in shallow}} soils and steep landscape under intense use of <b>agrochemicals</b> contributes to environment degradation. In this study, we assessed {{the concentration of}} <b>agrochemicals</b> in draw wells used for human consumption and a creek in a small catchment predominantly cropped to tobacco. Chlorpyrifos, flumetralin, and iprodione were determined by gas chromatography with electron capture detection, while imidalcloprid, atrazine, simazine, and clomazone were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. Considering all sampling sites, all <b>agrochemicals</b> were detected at least once, except for flumetralin. The occurrence of <b>agrochemicals</b> in tobacco crops {{is a consequence of}} their fast transfer to surface water...|$|R
40|$|The study {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} the determinants of farmer’s adoption of and investment in <b>agrochemicals</b> by collecting primary data from 156 sampled cocoa farmers in the Sefwi-Wiawso Municipality of Ghana. Descriptive statistical technique was employed to analyze demographic and farm-specific characteristics as well as the adoption rate and expenditure on <b>agrochemicals.</b> The findings highlighted the fact that, though a large proportion of farmers in the study area use <b>agrochemicals,</b> the intensity and amount spent to purchase these inputs are quite low. The Tobit regression model was used to identify and quantify {{the effects of the}} determinants of farmer’s investment in <b>agrochemicals.</b> The results generally indicate that the sex of the farmer, age of the farmer, household size, educational attainment, mean age of cocoa farms, farm size and farmers previous output are all important variables in explaining farmers decision to invest in <b>agrochemicals.</b> The paper concludes by recommending that strategic policies orienting towards improving the adoption rate as well as targeting farmers who are less likely to invest in <b>agrochemicals</b> is a pressing issue...|$|R
50|$|<b>Agrochemicals</b> and {{pharmaceuticals}} may operate via {{the same}} processes. In several cases, a homologous enzyme/receptor is addressed, and can potentially {{be of use}} in both contexts. One example is the triazole antimycotics or fungicides. However, the chemical environments encountered en route from the application site to the target generally require differing physicochemical properties, while the unit costs are generally much lower. <b>Agrochemicals</b> typically have a lower number of hydrogen bond donors. For example, over 70% of insecticides have no hydrogen bond donor, and over 90% of herbicides have two or fewer. Desirable <b>agrochemicals</b> have residual activity and persistence of effect lasting up to several weeks to allow large spray intervals. The majority of heterocycles found in <b>agrochemicals</b> are heteroaromatic.|$|R
25|$|Solubility is a {{property}} of interest in many aspects of science, including but not limited to: environmental predictions, biochemistry, pharmacy, drug-design, <b>agrochemical</b> design, and protein ligand binding. Aqueous solubility is of fundamental interest owing to the vital biological and transportation functions played by water. In addition, to this clear scientific interest in water solubility and solvent effects; accurate predictions of solubility are important industrially. The ability to accurately predict a molecules solubility represents potentially large financial savings in many chemical product development processes, such as pharmaceuticals. In the pharmaceutical industry, solubility predictions form part of the early stage lead optimisation process of drug candidates. Solubility remains a concern {{all the way to}} formulation. A number of methods have been applied to such predictions including quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSAR), quantitative structure–property relationships (QSPR) and data mining. These models provide efficient predictions of solubility and represent the current standard. The draw back such models is that they can lack physical insight. A method founded in physical theory, capable of achieving similar levels of accuracy at an sensible cost, would be a powerful tool scientifically and industrially.|$|E

2500|$|Zeolites still {{cannot be}} {{obtained}} in enantiopure form, which precludes their applications in catalytic asymmetric synthesis, e.g., for the pharmaceutical, <b>agrochemical,</b> and fragrance industries. Enantiopure chiral ligands or their metal complexes have {{been incorporated into}} MOFs to lead to efficient asymmetric catalysts. Even some MOF materials may {{bridge the gap between}} zeolites and enzymes when they combine isolated polynuclear sites, [...] host-guest responses, and a hydrophobic cavity environment. MOFs might be useful for making semi-conductors. Theoretical calculations show that MOFs are semiconductors or insulators with band gaps between 1.0 and 5.5 eV which can be altered by changing the degree of conjugation in the ligands indicating its possibility for being photocatalysts.|$|E

40|$|A {{research}} {{was carried out}} in order to evaluate how <b>agrochemicals</b> contamination and solar radiation influence the mechanical properties of ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) films. The films, manufactured adding several different combinations of light stabilizers, were subjected to natural and artificial weathering and to three <b>agrochemicals</b> commonly used during the cultivation practices. Two sets of field trials were carried out from 2006 to 2007 at the experimental centre of the University of Bari (Italy). The films, installed on steel arches of low tunnels, were periodically sprayed with the <b>agrochemicals</b> containing iron, chlorine and sulphur. For control the same films, mounted over other low tunnels, were not sprayed. Stress and strain at break of the film samples, taken at fixed time intervals in the field and after exposure in an artificial ageing chamber, were measured. Tests were conducted to evaluate the chemical contaminants absorbed by the films. Solar radiation falling on the films under test was continuously measured and recorded by means of a pyranometer and a CR 10 x Campbell data logger. The results of the tests showed that the different light stabilizers influenced the behaviour of the films in presence of the sprayed <b>agrochemicals.</b> The experimental data were investigated evaluating the cumulative solar radiation, the kind of anti-UV additive and the absorbed contaminants. Concerning the <b>agrochemicals</b> which were absorbed by the films, values up to 6800 ppm of sulphur were recorded during the tests. The research allowed the identification of the suitable additives in relation with used <b>agrochemicals.</b> The tests showed that an improved resistance to the <b>agrochemicals</b> was recorded for the EVA film stabilized with NOR-HALS plus UV filter...|$|R
