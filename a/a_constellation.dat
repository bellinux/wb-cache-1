5|$|Orion is {{mentioned}} in the oldest surviving works of Greek literature, which probably {{date back to the}} 7th or 8th century BC, but which are the products of an oral tradition with origins several centuries earlier. In Homer's Iliad Orion is described as <b>a</b> <b>constellation,</b> and the star Sirius {{is mentioned}} as his dog. In the Odyssey, Odysseus sees him hunting in the underworld with a bronze club, a great slayer of animals; he is also mentioned as <b>a</b> <b>constellation,</b> as the lover of the Goddess Dawn, as slain by Artemis, and as the most handsome of the earthborn. In the Works and Days of Hesiod, Orion is also <b>a</b> <b>constellation,</b> one whose rising and setting with the sun is used to reckon the year.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we develop}} {{two kinds of}} novel closedform decompositions on phase shift keying (PSK) constellations by {{exploiting}} linear congruence equation theory: the one for factorizing <b>a</b> pq-PSK <b>constellation</b> into <b>a</b> product of <b>a</b> p-PSK <b>constellation</b> and <b>a</b> q-PSK <b>constellation,</b> {{and the other for}} decomposing a specific complex number into a difference of <b>a</b> p-PSK <b>constellation</b> and <b>a</b> q-PSK <b>constellation.</b> With this, we propose a simple signal design technique to blindly and uniquely identify frequency selective channels with zero-padded block transmission under noise-free environments by only using the first two block received signal vectors. Furthermore, a closed-form solution to determine the transmitted signals and the channel coefficients is obtained. In the Gaussian noise and Rayleigh fading environment, we prove that the newly proposed signaling scheme enables non-coherent full diversity for the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) receiver.

5|$|The {{stars of}} Auriga were {{incorporated}} into several Chinese constellations. Wuche, the five chariots of the celestial emperors and {{the representation of the}} grain harvest, was <b>a</b> <b>constellation</b> formed by Alpha Aurigae, Beta Aurigae, Beta Tauri, Theta Aurigae, and Iota Aurigae. Sanzhu or Zhu was one of three constellations which represented poles for horses to be tethered. They were formed by the triplets of Epsilon, Zeta, and Eta Aurigae; Nu, Tau, and Upsilon Aurigae; and Chi and 26 Aurigae, with one other undetermined star. Xianchi, the pond where the sun set and Tianhuang, a pond, bridge, or pier, were other constellations in Auriga, though the stars that composed them are undetermined. Zuoqi, representing chairs for the emperor and other officials, was made up of nine stars in the east of the constellation. Bagu, <b>a</b> <b>constellation</b> mostly formed from stars in Camelopardalis representing different types of crops, included the northern stars of Delta and Xi Aurigae.|$|E
5|$|The uranography of Andromeda has {{its roots}} most firmly in the Greek tradition, though a female figure in Andromeda's {{location}} had appeared earlier in Babylonian astronomy. The stars that make up Pisces and the middle portion of modern Andromeda formed <b>a</b> <b>constellation</b> representing a fertility goddess, sometimes named as Anunitum or the Lady of the Heavens.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{movement}} {{in the late nineteenth}} century to interpret all the Boeotian heroes as merely personifications of the constellations; there has since come to be wide agreement that the myth of Orion existed before there was <b>a</b> <b>constellation</b> named for him. Homer, for example, mentions Orion, the Hunter, and Orion, the constellation, but never confuses the two. Once Orion was recognized as <b>a</b> <b>constellation,</b> astronomy in turn affected the myth. The story of Side may well be a piece of astronomical mythology. The Greek word side means pomegranate, which bears fruit while Orion, the constellation, can be seen in the night sky. Rose suggests she is connected with Sidae in Boeotia, and that the pomegranate, as a sign of the Underworld, is connected with her descent there.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} <b>a</b> <b>constellation</b> {{was known to}} exist during the Babylonian period. Ancient sky watchers {{imagined}} that prominent arrangements of stars formed patterns, and they associated these with particular aspects of nature or their myths. Twelve of these formations lay along the band of the ecliptic and these became the basis of astrology. Many of the more prominent individual stars were also given names, particularly with Arabic or Latin designations.|$|E
5|$|In Brazil, the Bororo people {{incorporate}} {{the stars of}} Auriga into a massive constellation representing a caiman; its southern stars represent {{the end of the}} animal's tail. The eastern portion of Taurus is the rest of the tail, while Orion is its body and Lepus is the head. This constellation arose because of the prominence of caymans in daily Amazonian life. There is evidence that Capella was significant to the Aztec people, as the Late Classic site Monte Albán has a marker for the star's heliacal rising. Indigenous peoples of California and Nevada also noticed the bright pattern of Auriga's stars. To them, the constellation's bright stars formed a curve that was represented in crescent-shaped petroglyphs. The indigenous Pawnee of North America recognized <b>a</b> <b>constellation</b> with the same major stars as modern Auriga: Alpha, Beta, Gamma (Beta Tauri), Theta, and Iota Aurigae.|$|E
5|$|Lynx is <b>a</b> <b>constellation</b> {{named after}} the animal, usually {{observed}} in the northern sky. The constellation {{was introduced in the}} late 17th century by Johannes Hevelius. It is a faint constellation, with its brightest stars forming a zigzag line. The orange giant Alpha Lyncis is the brightest star in the constellation, and the semiregular variable star Y Lyncis is a target for amateur astronomers. Six star systems have been found to contain planets. Those of 6 Lyncis and HD 75898 were discovered by the Doppler method; those of XO-2, XO-4, XO-5 and WASP-13 were observed as they passed in front of the host star.|$|E

5|$|Perseus is <b>a</b> <b>constellation</b> in the {{northern}} sky, being named after the Greek mythological hero Perseus. It {{is one of the}} 48 listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and among the 88 modern constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It is located near several other constellations named after ancient Greek legends surrounding Perseus, including Andromeda to the west and Cassiopeia to the north. Perseus is also bordered by Aries and Taurus to the south, Auriga to the east, Camelopardalis to the north, and Triangulum to the west. Some star atlases during the early 19th century also depicted Perseus holding onto the head of the Medusa, whose asterism was named together as Perseus et Caput Medusae, however, this never came into popular usage.|$|E
5|$|The {{first record}} of Auriga's stars was in Mesopotamia as <b>a</b> <b>constellation</b> called GAM, {{representing}} a scimitar or crook. However, {{this may have}} represented just Capella (Alpha Aurigae) or the modern constellation as a whole; this figure was alternatively called Gamlum or MUL.GAM in the MUL.APIN. The crook of Auriga stood for a goat-herd or shepherd. It was formed {{from most of the}} stars of the modern constellation; all of the bright stars were included except for Elnath, traditionally assigned to both Taurus and Auriga. Later, Bedouin astronomers created constellations that were groups of animals, where each star represented one animal. The stars of Auriga comprised a herd of goats, an association also present in Greek mythology. The association with goats carried into the Greek astronomical tradition, though it later became associated with a charioteer along with the shepherd.|$|E

5|$|Tycho Brahe, also {{credited}} with Coma's designation as <b>a</b> <b>constellation,</b> included {{it in his}} 1602 star catalogue. Brahe recorded fourteen stars in the constellation; Johannes Hevelius increased its number to twenty-one, and John Flamsteed to forty-three. Coma Berenices also appeared in Johann Bayer's 1603 Uranometria, {{and a few other}} 17th-century celestial maps followed suit. Coma Berenices and the now-obsolete Antinous are considered the first post-Ptolemaic constellations depicted on a celestial globe. With Antinous, Coma Berenices exemplified a trend in astronomy in which globe- and map-makers continued to rely on the ancients for data. This trend ended {{at the turn of the}} 16th century with observations of the southern sky and the work of Tycho Brahe.|$|E
5|$|Aries was {{not fully}} {{accepted}} as <b>a</b> <b>constellation</b> until classical times. In Hellenistic astrology, {{the constellation of}} Aries {{is associated with the}} golden ram of Greek mythology that rescued Phrixos and Helle on orders from Hermes, taking Phrixos to the land of Colchis. Phrixos and Helle were the son and daughter of King Athamas and his first wife Nephele. The king's second wife, Ino, was jealous and wished to kill his children. To accomplish this, she induced a famine in Boeotia, then falsified a message from the Oracle of Delphi that said Phrixos must be sacrificed to end the famine. Athamas was about to sacrifice his son atop Mount Laphystium when Aries, sent by Nephele, arrived. Helle fell off of Aries's back in flight and drowned in the Dardanelles, also called the Hellespont in her honor. After arriving, Phrixos sacrificed the ram to Zeus and gave the Fleece to Aeëtes of Colchis, who rewarded him with an engagement to his daughter Chalciope. Aeëtes hung its skin in a sacred place where it became known as the Golden Fleece and was guarded by a dragon. In a later myth, this Golden Fleece was stolen by Jason and the Argonauts.|$|E
