5|$|Most social foragers must {{search for}} food while also {{avoiding}} predators. It {{has been suggested}} that individuals that play scrounger could also, by virtue of their head position, be <b>alert</b> <b>for</b> predators and hence contribute to antipredatory vigilance. If the scrounger tactic is compatible with antipredatory vigilance, then an increase in antipredatory vigilance should lead to the detection of more joining opportunities, and hence more joining. When stationary, the head-up tactic {{has been shown to be}} associated with antipredatory vigilance. However scanning while hopping does not aid in vigilance and it is thought that the scrounger tactic is incompatible with antipredatory vigilance in the scaly-breasted munia.|$|E

5|$|The {{popularity}} of Steam {{has led to}} the service's being attacked by hackers in the past. An attempt occurred in November 2011, when Valve temporarily closed the community forums, citing potential hacking threats to the service. Days later, Valve reported that the hack had compromised one of its customer databases, potentially allowing the perpetrators to access customer informationincluding encrypted password and credit card details. At that time, Valve was not aware whether the intruders actually accessed this information or discovered the encryption method, but nevertheless warned users to be <b>alert</b> <b>for</b> fraudulent activity.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Etau {{originated}} on August5 {{out of an}} area of {{low pressure}} associated with disorganized convective activity located about 550km (280mi) east-northeast of Guam. The following day, the system relocated several dozen kilometers to the north.
