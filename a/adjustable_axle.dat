50|$|ADtranz and Henschel {{aimed to}} develop bogies for the class 101 that would allow for the maximum {{possible}} latitude for future evolution. Therefore, the bogies were designed for top speeds of 250 km/h and are derived directly from the ICE design, even though the locomotives of class 101 were only capable of maximum speeds of 220 km/h. In addition, the bogies were designed {{to be able to}} support the wheel set of other gauges. It is also possible to install a radially <b>adjustable</b> <b>axle,</b> such as is in service in class 460 of the SBB (Swiss Railways), but the DB elected to go without this option.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Farmall {{is widely}} viewed as the first tractor to combine a set of traits that would define the row-crop tractor category, although competition in the category came quickly. Although {{it was not the}} first tractor to have any one of these traits, it was early in bringing the winning combination to market. The traits included (a) 'tricycle' [...] (a single front wheel or narrowly spaced pair), high ground clearance, quickly <b>adjustable</b> <b>axle</b> track, excellent visibility all around and under the machine, and light weight; (b) sufficient power for plowing and harrowing, and a belt pulley for belt work; and (c) all at low cost, with a familiar brand and an extensive distribution and service network. The first group of traits allowed for more nimble maneuvering and accurate cultivation than most other tractors of the day; additionally, because of the second group, the Farmall could also, like previous tractors, perform all the other duties a farmer would have previously achieved using a team of horses. A tractor could yield lower overall operating costs than horses {{as long as it was}} priced right and reliable (and its fuel supply as well). The Farmall, mass-produced with the same low-cost-and-high-value ethos as the Ford Model T or Fordson tractor, could meet that requirement. The Farmall was thus similar to a Fordson in its capabilities and affordability, but with better cultivating ability.|$|E

Demographic and {{socioeconomic}} {{factors associated with}} disparity in wheelchair customizability among people with traumatic spinal cord injury. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2004; 85 : 1859 - 64. To determine if a standard of care for wheelchair provision exists within the participating centers {{and if there is}} disparity in wheelchair customizability among the study sample. Convenience sample survey. Thirteen Model Spinal Cord Injury Systems that provide comprehensive rehabilitation for people with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) and {{that are part of the}} national database funded through the US Department of Education. A total of 412 people with SCI who use wheelchairs over 40 hours a week. Survey information was obtained from subjects via telephone and in-person interviews and from the national database. Collected information included age, race, education, level of injury, and wheelchair funding source. Number and type (manual or power) of wheelchairs. Wheelchair customizability as defined by design features (eg, <b>adjustable</b> <b>axle</b> position, programmable controls). Ninety-seven percent of manual wheelchair users and 54 % of power wheelchair users had customizable wheelchairs. No power wheelchair user received a wheelchair without programmable controls. Minorities with low socioeconomic backgrounds (low income, Medicaid/Medicare recipients, less educated) were more likely to have standard manual and standard programmable power wheelchairs. Older subjects were also more likely to have standard programmable power wheelchairs. The standard of care for manual wheelchair users with SCI is a lightweight and customizable wheelchair. The standard of care for power wheelchairs users has programmable controls. Unfortunately, socioeconomically disadvantaged people were less likely to receive customizable wheelchairs.

50|$|A gauge changer is {{a device}} which forces the gauge {{adjustment}} in the wheels. Designs {{consist of a}} pair of running rails that gradually vary in width between the two gauges, combined with other rails and levers to unlock, move, support and re-lock the <b>adjustable</b> <b>axles.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Where {{vehicles}} cross {{a change}} of gauge, they must either be equipped for {{a change of}} bogie or have <b>adjustable</b> gauge <b>axles.</b> For example passenger trains crossing between the [...] system in France and the [...] in Spain pass through a special installation which adjusts their variable gauge axles. This temporary alteration to allow through working is generally referred to as [...] "gauge change".|$|R
5|$|With the {{development}} of the U.S. railroad system, natural ice became used to transport larger quantities of goods much longer distances through the invention of the refrigerator car. The first refrigerator cars emerged in the late 1850s and early 1860s, and were crude constructions holding up to 3,000lbs (1,360kg) of ice, on top of which the food was placed. It was quickly found that placing meat directly on top of blocks of ice in cars caused it to perish; subsequent designs hung the meat from hooks, allowing the meat to breathe, while the swinging carcasses improved the circulation in the car. After the Civil War, J. B Sutherland, John Bate and William Davis all patented improved refrigerator cars, which used stacks of ice placed at either end and improved air circulation to keep their contents cool. This improved ventilation was essential to avoid warm air building up in the car and causing damage to the goods. Salt could be added to the ice to increase the cooling effect to produce an iced refrigerator car, which preserved foods even better. For much of the 19th century, the different gauges of train lines made it difficult and time consuming to move chilled cargoes between lines, which was a problem when the ice was continually melting; by the 1860s, refrigerator cars with <b>adjustable</b> <b>axles</b> were being created to speed up this process.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{production}} SSZ Stradale featured an all new {{tubular chassis}} {{combined with a}} Kevlar reinforced fiberglass body. These cars were powered by an Alfa Romeo 3.0 V6 engine with a 5-speed overdrive transmission coupled to an <b>adjustable</b> ratio live <b>axle.</b> Four wheel 12" [...] driver adjustable brakes, adjustable coil over suspension, rack and pinion steering, front and rear adjustable sway bars, fuel cell and fire system were standard features.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1966 {{the company}} {{produced}} two Formula Vee cars, Broke {{that was a}} copy of the American Beach Car and Dolling FVe that was a design by Willy Dolling. The Dolling was made in three versions between 1966 and 1967, in total 52 cars were built. In 1967 RPB started making their own Formula Vee car. It was simple to make and inexpensive. It sold well and did well in races. In 1968 the chassis was improved to make it more rigid and give it a more <b>adjustable</b> rear <b>axle</b> design. In 1969 the car was redesigned again, this time to increase performance, but only six were made due to rumours about changes in the Formula Vee rules. In 1970 the new rules came and they allowed a more wedge like shape and a longer and narrower car. 13-15 cars were made. The RPB cars were very successful and they won 14 out of 18 competitions. One of them was still winning races in 1978. The same model continued to be built in 1971 and 1972, but only in small numbers. In 1971 RPB cars made 22 European track records. In 1971 a Formula Super Vee car was made. This time using a monocoque chassis. The prototype car did well in races, but was plagued with engine problems and the rear end of the chassis had to be redesigned. After the redesign it worked better and the driver Bror Jaktlund managed to finished as number 3 in the European championship, even if a crash forced him to skip the last race. A second Super Formula Vee car was made in 1973 and was in use until it was sold in 1976. It then changed hands several times to owners in Sweden, Denmark and England until it came back to Sweden in late 2002.|$|R
