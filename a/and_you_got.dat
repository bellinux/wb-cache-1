5|$|I {{loved the}} Spitfire {{in all of}} her many versions. But I {{have to admit that}} the later marks, {{although}} they were faster than the earlier ones, were also much heavier and so did not handle so well. You did not have such positive control over them. One test of manoeuvrability was to throw her into a flick-roll and see how many times she rolled. With the Mark II or the Mark V one got two-and-a-half flick-rolls but the Mark IX was heavier <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> only one-and-a-half. With the later and still heavier versions, one got even less. The essence of aircraft design is compromise, and an improvement {{at one end of the}} performance envelope is rarely achieved without a deterioration somewhere else.|$|E
25|$|Pre-release {{audience}} pollings {{predicted the}} film to take in $20million its opening weekend. However, Paramount {{expected it to be}} closer to $15million. Footloose opened in 3,549 theaters taking in $15.5million and placing number two, behind Real Steel ($16.2million) in its opening weekend. Exit polls indicated that the film appealed to 75percent of females and 28percent of the teen market. About 60percent of the audience were over age 25 and 46percent over age 35. The 20th highest grossing locations on Friday were in Salt Lake City, Oklahoma City, Knoxville, Kansas City, and San Antonio. The opening was lower than other recent dance films like, Save the Last Dance (2001, $23.4million), Step Up (2006, $20.7million), but it performed around the same as Step Up 3D (2010, $15.8million) <b>and</b> <b>You</b> <b>Got</b> Served (2004, $16.1million). The 1984 Footloose opened to $20million when adjusted for ticket price inflation. In its second weekend the film held well, with a drop of 34percent. It placed third and grossed an estimated $10.4million.|$|E
500|$|In a 2003 {{interview}} with the Grand Rapids Press, Dufek recalled growing up in Ann Arbor and meeting his father's Michigan teammates. [...] "Living in Ann Arbor, and seeing {{all the things that}} embody a great university, you learned that there were highly successful people in athletics, and it just made you want to feel a part of it. Then, as you got older, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> more deeply involved in the game yourself, you just hoped that {{you had a chance to}} play in college -- and after watching all those games at Michigan Stadium, that maybe Michigan would take a chance on you." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Clown"'s concept {{deals with}} an {{incident}} that happened in San Diego, California. A skinhead that told Davis to [...] "go back to Bakersfield" [...] attempted to hit Davis but he dodged and the band's road manager, Jeff, knocked the skinhead out. [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] was about Davis' drug abuse, and the fear that gripped him {{at the height of}} his drug problem. He pleaded for a divine intervention to deliver him from his nightmare, as if he cannot help himself. Davis explained: [...] "I'd wake up in the morning and do a line to get out of bed. Speed in the morning, I'd have it all lined up for breakfast so when I'd lay down and go to sleep, I'd wake up and just snort and it's like 'Yeah, okay, I'm up. ' It was bad. It's like, you do one line and stay up all night, but then you have shit to do the next day so you have to do another line to be able keep staying up to get that shit done. Eventually you start spinning-out from sleep deprivation. You get hallucinations and shit like that." [...] Davis said that [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] "is about meth. It's about when you do meth and you look down at your dick and it's literally a helmet in the bush [...] ". [...] "Basically it's what happens when you do too much drugs and your girl wanna get with you <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> some man problems down below. Just another reason not to do drugs, children," [...] Fieldy elaborated.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1999, the [...] removed two books, {{one being}} Bless Me, Ultima, from teacher Carol Bennett’s English classes. The removal was {{proposed}} by board member Jerry Haroldsen based on complaints from parents of Benett's {{students about the}} violence and profanity within the book. Haroldsen articulated the reasoning for the board's action: “What {{we are doing is}} trying to protect the children. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> a teacher that’s trying to do what we do not think is right”. All copies of Bless Me, Ultima were pulled from the classes and placed in the principal’s office.|$|E
2500|$|Australia {{ended the}} day with 400/5 from 90 overs, and Ponting was unbeaten on 176, his 19th test hundred and his fifth for the year 2003, a {{remarkable}} year for him {{in which he had}} hitherto scored 1149 runs at an average of 95.75, and had set his sights for a double century. His innings was exceptional. For his first 100 runs, he picked boundaries in the gaps on the off-side, {{in spite of the fact}} that that region was packed with fielders. He raced on to his 100 from just 117 balls, but slowed down considerably, once he reached his 150. He commented about his innings, admitting that he was satisfied with the way he played on that day. He said, [...] "It was a good wicket, and a good outfield, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> real value for your strokes." [...] He commented of the Indian bowlers that, [...] "They missed Zaheer...He's been their best bowler the past couple of years, and he bowled well up in Brisbane. They didn't bowl as well as they'd have liked today, but you can't judge them based on that." [...] Ponting's crisp strokeplay combined with aggression to produce a fantastic knock. However, he was aided by the fact that Ganguly got rid of the 8–1 and 7–2 fields thereby [...] depriving his bowlers the chance of getting lbws or any catches.|$|E
