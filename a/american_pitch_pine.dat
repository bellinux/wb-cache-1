5000|$|Halpin is {{reputed to}} have been given an open cheque by the British Government to build his new mansion in {{gratitude}} for his contribution to improving world communications and thereby world trade. He recruited the then very fashionable Irish architect, James Franklin Fuller, to design the house. The timber, which is so evident and gives such character, was selected in London by Halpin. The doors {{on the ground floor}} are of Burmese mahogany with many panels of different woods, the best of which are in [...] "birds eye" [...] maple. The architraves, window shutters and stairs are in <b>American</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>pine.</b> Fireplaces were imported from Italy {{with the exception of the}} drawing room where a fine Georgian one, probably from an old house in Dublin, graces the room. The cellar, with space for 2,000 bottles of wine, is built of brick while the rest of the construction is in stone and mortar. The original working drawings can be seen hanging in the AnteRoom to the Brunel Dining Room.|$|E
60|$|In {{coming down}} from this tower, we somehow or other got upon the ramparts, which connect it with the great gate. We walked on the wall four abreast, and played that we were knights and ladies of the olden time, walking on the ramparts. And I picked a bough from an old pine tree that grew over our heads; it much resembled our <b>American</b> yellow <b>pitch</b> <b>pine.</b>|$|R
5|$|Nescopeck Mountain is one {{of several}} {{mountains}} in Columbia County to contain undisturbed oak/mixed hardwood forests. This forest is also an Appalachian Oak Forest. Specific tree species on the ridge in Columbia County include red oak, chestnut oak, scarlet oak, black birch, <b>American</b> chestnut, <b>pitch</b> <b>pine,</b> red maple, and serviceberry. Other plants on the ridge include black huckleberry, lowbush blueberry, mountain laurel, sheep's laurel, bracken fern, wild sarsaparilla, and Virginia creeper.|$|R
50|$|Acheology {{indicates}} that the Iroquois, Shinnecock, and Cherokee all utilized <b>pitch</b> <b>pine.</b> The Iroquois used the pitch to treat rheumatism, burns, cuts, and boils. Pitch also {{worked as a}} laxative. A <b>pitch</b> <b>pine</b> poultice was used by both the Iroquois and the Shinnecock to open boils and to treat abscesses. The Cherokee used <b>pitch</b> <b>pine</b> wood in canoe construction and for decorative carvings.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pitch</b> <b>pine</b> is {{currently}} used mainly for rough construction, pulp, crating, and fuel. However, {{due to its}} uneven growth, quantities of high quality can be very sought after, and large lengths of <b>pitch</b> <b>pine</b> can be very costly.|$|R

50|$|Longleaf pine also {{is known}} as being one of several species grouped as a {{southern}} yellow pine or longleaf yellow pine, {{and in the past}} as <b>pitch</b> <b>pine</b> (a name dropped as it caused confusion with <b>pitch</b> <b>pine,</b> Pinus rigida).|$|R
50|$|At {{the north}} end of its range, it intergrades and hybridises with <b>pitch</b> <b>pine</b> (P. rigida); it is {{distinguished}} from that species by the longer needles and on average slightly larger cones. Some botanists treat pond pine as a subspecies of <b>pitch</b> <b>pine.</b>|$|R
5000|$|E. W. Russell has {{described}} the Sand Plains as follows, [...] "The landscape today forms a sharp contrast with the surrounding flat, fertile farmland, which is almost all cleared of trees and planted in crops. Uplands, including some dunes, support forest vegetation of American beech, white oak (Quercus alba), red and sugar maples, white and <b>pitch</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus strobus and P. rigida), gray birch (Betula populifolia), hemlock, aspen (Populus spp.), American elm, and other northern hardwood species. Some uplands are also characterized as <b>pitch</b> <b>pine</b> heaths, dominated by <b>pitch</b> <b>pines</b> with an understory of blueberries (Vaccinium spp.) and other related (ericaceous) shrubs. <b>Pitch</b> <b>pine</b> is the characteristic tree of the wetlands, along with aspen, gray birch, and red maple, along with an ericaceous shrub layer." ...|$|R
40|$|The northeastern pine zale is a moth of barrens {{habitats}} and <b>pitch</b> <b>pine</b> areas in eastern Pennsylvania. It is currently known from three sites in Pennsylvania, {{two in the}} southeast {{and one in the}} northeast. Northeastern pine zale can utilize a variety of <b>pitch</b> <b>pine</b> barrens, woodlands, and pine-oak forests. The larval food plant in Pennsylvania is <b>pitch</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus rigida). The species is best collected at bait. More surveys are needed in <b>pitch</b> <b>pine</b> areas in appropriate habitat in the Appalachian Mountains and eastern Pennsylvania during the spring flight period (mid May to mid June). Current Threats: Fire is a potential threat to this species especially in June and July during the egg and active larval stages. However, fire is often necessary for maintaining open barrens. However, this species does not appear to require pristine pine barrens. It also does well in <b>pitch</b> <b>pine</b> woodlands or pine-oak forests. Spraying to control gypsy moths may negatively affect the species depending on the life stage of the species, type of spray used, timing of spraying activities, and number of applications.

In this type of forest, <b>pitch</b> <b>pine,</b> scrub oak, black oak and chestnut oak are the main trees. Bracken fern, teaberry, black chokeberry, blueberry, and huckleberry are the most common shrubs in this habitat.|$|R

50|$|The church {{dates from}} the 12th century with {{elements}} from the 13th and 14th centuries. It was restored in 1885 - 1886 by John Loughborough Pearson who added a new roof of <b>pitch</b> <b>pine.</b> The stonework was repointed and the walls replastered. The west end gallery was removed and the box pews were replaced with open sittings of <b>pitch</b> <b>pine.</b> The floor was paved with wooden blocks and a new heating apparatus by Bacon and Co of London was installed.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pitch</b> <b>pine</b> {{is not a}} major timber tree due to the {{frequency}} of multiple or crooked trunks; nor is it as fast-growing as other eastern American pines. However, it grows well on unfavorable sites. In the past, it was a major source of pitch and timber for ship building, mine timbers, and railroad ties because the wood's high resin content preserves it from decay. <b>Pitch</b> <b>pine</b> wood was also used for building radio towers in Germany, as at Muehlacker and Ismaning.|$|R

50|$|The larvae mainly feed on <b>Pitch</b> <b>pine</b> in the north. Southern hosts {{probably}} include loblolly, Pond {{pine and}} long leaf pines. They feed on fully hardened, mature needles.|$|R
50|$|This pine {{occupies}} {{a variety of}} habitats from rocky uplands to wet flood plains. It frequently hybridizes naturally with loblolly <b>pine</b> and <b>pitch</b> <b>pine</b> where their ranges intersect.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pitch</b> <b>pine</b> is rapid-growing when young, gaining {{around one}} foot of height per year under optimal {{conditions}} until {{the tree is}} 50-60 years old, whereupon growth slows. By 90 years of age, the amount of annual height gain is minimal. Open-growth trees begin bearing cones {{in as little as}} three years, with shade-inhabiting pines taking a few years longer. Cones take two years to mature and seed dispersal occurs over the fall and winter and trees cannot self-pollinate. The total lifespan of <b>pitch</b> <b>pine</b> is about 200 years.|$|R
50|$|Crooked Pond is {{a typical}} coastal plain pond occupying a {{depression}} connected hydrologically to an underground aquifer; hence, the water level of the pond changes with the water table. The water level is usually high in winter and spring, and generally much lower by late summer, exposing the shoreline. Three other ponds, Island, Gunners Exchange and Hoyts, are within 1 km of Crooked Pond. The southeastern corner of Gunners Exchange Pond and parcels on Island Pond {{are part of the}} Refuge. The upland habitat surrounding ponds on the Refuge is a mix of <b>pitch</b> <b>pine</b> — scrub oak and coastal oak/heath forest. Common species include: red maple, <b>pitch</b> <b>pine,</b> white pine, and scrub oak. The under-story consists of highbush blueberry, low sweet blueberry, bearberry and greenbrier. <b>Pitch</b> <b>pine</b> scrub oak communities need fire to maintain the community structure and diversity. The resinous, waxy cutins in the leaves of many of the plant species found in this community are highly flammable and easily ignite during dry periods. Today the area is generally protected from fire, resulting in a closed-canopy pine forest.|$|R
