5|$|After winning Miss India World, Chopra {{was cast}} as the female lead in Abbas-Mustan's romantic thriller Humraaz (2002), {{in which she was}} to make her film debut.

A review published in The Hindu was appreciative of the film for its wit and dialogue, however it felt that Chopra's role was limited from <b>an</b> <b>acting</b> viewpoint.|$|E
