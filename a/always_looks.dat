500|$|Upon Bradman's {{death in}} February 2001, Brown became the oldest living Australian Test cricketer, greatly {{amused by the}} fame {{that came with the}} title. Highly {{regarded}} by Australian cricketers of the modern era, Steve Waugh invited Brown to present Test debutant Adam Gilchrist with his baggy green. The humble Brown was surprised, thinking himself an unworthy choice. [...] Waugh disagreed, opining that [...] "Bill is a baggy green icon who represents all that is good about playing for your country. He is humble, self-effacing and respectful, proud to have been afforded the honour of being an Australian Test cricketer, and a man who <b>always</b> <b>looks</b> for the positive in people." [...] In March 2008, Brown died in Brisbane at the age of 95. He was the last surviving Invincible to have played Test cricket before World War II and his death leaves only four living members of Bradman's 1948 team.|$|E

500|$|Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury responded {{negatively}} to Jacqui's Promiscuity in 2010 by stating: [...] "I DON'T like to bandy names about but...that Jacqui McQueen {{is a right}} trollop." [...] Rhiannon Vivian of the Sunday Mirror describe Jacqui as a [...] "hard-bitten" [...] character. Men's lifestyle magazine FHM brand Jacqui a [...] "notoriously sexy bad-girl". On a separate occasion Olly Richards of the magazine stated: [...] "In the soap she <b>always</b> <b>looks</b> a bit hard and like she could definitely beat us up." [...] Josie Ensor of WalesOnline spoke about Cooper stating: [...] "feisty jailbird character Jacqui has made her infamous on and off screen." [...] Colin Robertson of newspaper The Sun also agreed with the [...] "feisty brunette" [...] tag. Kris Green of Digital Spy branded Cooper {{as one of his}} favourite Hollyoaks actresses due to her portrayal of Jacqui. Dawn Collinson of the Liverpool Echo refers to Jacqui as a [...] "brassy character".|$|E
500|$|Hillenburg {{used some}} {{character}} designs from his comic book. He designed [...] "SpongeBob's grumpy next door neighbor" [...] as an octopus because the species' large head; octopi, he said, [...] "have {{such a large}} bulbous head and Squidward thinks he's an intellectual so of course, he's gonna have a large bulbous head." [...] Hillenburg drew Squidward with six tentacles because [...] "it was really just simpler for animation to draw him with six legs instead of eight". Show writer and storyboard artist Vincent Waller said: Squidward is hard to drawhe has a very odd-shaped head. Fortunately, his emotions are pretty even, but to get {{a whole lot of}} big emoting out of him is a challenge. His nose splits everything in half, so it's always like, 'OK, how am I going to work this and still make it read?' Hillenburg thought of making jokes with Squidward ejecting ink but retired it because, according to him, [...] "it <b>always</b> <b>looks</b> like he's pooping his pants". However, it occurs in [...] and the sixth season episode, [...] "Giant Squidward".|$|E
500|$|Kierkegaard’s {{discourse}} {{has to do}} {{with the}} difference between wishing and willing in the development of a particular expectancy. [...] "As thought becomes more absorbed in the future, it loses its way in its restless attempt to force or entice an explanation from the riddle." [...] Expectancy <b>always</b> <b>looks</b> to the future and can hope, but regret, which is what Goethe did in his book The Sorrows of Young Werther, closes the door of hope and love becomes unhappy. Kierkegaard points to [...] "faith as the highest" [...] expectancy because faith is something that everyone has, or can have. He says: [...] "The person who wishes it for another person wishes it for himself; the person who wishes it for himself wishes it for every other human being, because that by which another person has faith is not that by which he is different from him but is that by which he is like him; that by which he possesses it is not that by which he is different from others but that by which he is altogether like all." ...|$|E

500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} with a C. He criticized Gilmore's {{performance}} in [...] "That Still Small Voice" [...] and earlier episodes, writing that [...] "Gilmore struggles {{to make a}} connection with his character, so it <b>always</b> <b>looks</b> like he’s reading lines," [...] which might {{have a negative effect}} on the Henry's character development. Sava felt that Espenson, based on her previous work, was good at balancing large casts and wrote [...] "this episode juggles the expansive character roster of this series better than its predecessors." [...] Conversely, IGN's Amy Ratcliffe said she has [...] "never liked Henry as much as I did in this episode," [...] especially his explanation to Archie on why he is Jiminy Cricket. Ratcliffe added that Jiminy had the [...] "most touching backstory" [...] of the season up to that point, opining that [...] "the transformation of Dr. Hopper was moving, and this episode maybe felt the most like a fairytale of the stories we've seen so far." [...] She graded [...] "That Still Small Voice" [...] with 8 out of 10, an indication of a [...] "great" [...] episode.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, Tapping {{found it}} a {{challenge}} to play a different character, as Carter and Magnus have differing personalities and points of view; [...] "after playing a character like Sam Carter for so long where her physicality is so comfortable – Sam is so comfortable in her own skin and Helen is this very sexual, more mysterious being. She has a much darker edge to her and {{it was sort of}} finding that because Carter <b>always</b> <b>looks</b> on the bright side and Helen has been around so long, and has seen so much of the evil in human society if you will." [...] Whilst filming the webisodes, Tapping wore a dark-haired wig, but when the television series was being shot, she dyed her hair to match the hair colour of the wig. Tapping spoke with an English accent throughout the run of the series. Although many of her relatives are from the United Kingdom and speak with British accents Tapping found the accent a challenge, as her character came from the Victorian era, which is a [...] "very specific way of speaking. She clings to that eccentricity a bit, to that Britishness." [...] The actress listened to several different voices, as she had to factor in the fact that Magnus lived all around the world.|$|E
500|$|In A Midsummer Night's Dream, Theseus, the Duke of Athens, is {{preparing}} to marry Hippolyta. Peter Quince decides to entertain her and hires a group of actors nicknamed the Rude Mechanicals to perform Pyramus and Thisbe, a love story. Robin {{is one of the}} Rude Mechanicals, the tailor, who gathers with his colleagues to prepare their production. Robin at first is told to play the part of Thisbe's mother, but Peter Quince points out that a love story needs moonlight shining on the lovers to have any real effect on the audience. After Nick Bottom suggests looking in the almanac for a time when the Moon might shine on their performance, the players apparently decide that they will just have Robin act as Moonshine. Robin's role as Moonshine in The Mechanical's performance of Pyramus and Thisbe before Theseus' court is often highlighted by scholars as among the funnier parts of the play. Although the court makes fun of all the players, Starveling is mocked the most by Hippolyta, who is very vocal in her opinion that his attempt to be moonshine is a ridiculous failure, although very humorous. [...] He is also the only mechanical to be cut off in his monologue as opposed to being mocked afterwards, causing him to fluster and summarise his lines rather than giving them. [...] This summary is usually played angrily or irritably, but has also been performed as the climax of Starveling's potential stage fright. [...] Starveling is the member of the group that seems to be afraid of just about anything. [...] Starveling is the most ambiguous in taking sides in the power struggle between Bottom and Quince. [...] While Snout affirms whatever Quince says and Flute <b>always</b> <b>looks</b> to Bottom for the final word on something (Snug is too slow to be bothered), Starveling seems to try to agree completely with both, as impossible as it is to do so.|$|E

In Tibetan, Avalokiteśvara is Chenrézik, (...) and is said to emanate as the Dalai Lama the Karmapa and other high lamas. An etymology of the Tibetan name Chenrézik is spyan [...] "eye", ras [...] "continuity" [...] and gzig [...] "to look".

2500|$|Bork {{was best}} known for his theory {{that the only way to}} {{reconcile}} the role of the judiciary in the U.S. government against what he terms the [...] "Madisonian" [...] or [...] "counter-majoritarian" [...] dilemma of the judiciary making law without popular approval is for constitutional adjudication to be guided by the framers' original understanding of the United States Constitution. Reiterating that it is a court's task to adjudicate and not to [...] "legislate from the bench," [...] he advocated that judges exercise restraint in deciding cases, emphasizing that the role of the courts is to frame [...] "neutral principles" [...] (a term borrowed from Herbert Wechsler) and not simply ad hoc pronouncements or subjective value judgments. Bork once said, [...] "The truth is that the judge who looks outside the Constitution <b>always</b> <b>looks</b> inside himself and nowhere else." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ledley {{has been}} {{described}} as having a terrific engine. This is because of his high fitness level and work rate. He works equally hard in defence as attack and <b>always</b> <b>looks</b> to win the ball off the opposition, while he is also able to contribute goals to his team going forward. He is comfortable on the ball and is a decent passer. He is also a very physical player. Ledley has been criticised for not being a very quick player, [...] some critics have suggested that several Premier League clubs who were interested in him may have been put off by his lack of pace. However, John Hartson has said that pace is not necessarily the most important thing, especially when Ledley is good in so many other aspects of the game. He has also said that he thinks Ledley would be able to play in the Premier League and compared his style of play to that of players like Xabi Alonso and Frank Lampard.|$|E
2500|$|Episodes two {{and three}} did not fare as well, critically. Discussing the second episode, Michael Hogan in The Daily Telegraph found the quickened pace invigorating, and found the story gripping. But Neela Debnath at The Independent criticised the writing, concluding, [...] "Sadly, all the {{electric}} tension of episode one has evaporated, instead events are becoming improbable and additional drama seems to be shoehorned in {{for the sake of}} it. ... There's so much going on that it's starting to feel unbelievable." [...] Ross McG at Metro largely agreed with these points, and noted that the courtroom drama seemed bland because it essentially reiterated facts viewers already knew. Ben Skipper at the International Business Times was harsh in his appraisal, calling episode two [...] "Broadchurch first truly bad hour of television." [...] He blasted the plot, particularly the apparent kidnapping of Claire Ripley, the clichéd timing of Beth Latimer going into labour, and legal inconsistencies. He also called Marianne Jean-Baptiste's performance [...] "lacking". The [...] "Bafta-winning detective drama is a heap of old codswallop that makes no sense at all," [...] said Christopher Stevens in the Daily Mail, referencing episode three. [...] "The first episode was shaky. The second was riddled with errors. But the third was beyond all forgiving." [...] There was limited praise for episode three, however. Ben Dowell at Radio Times had high praise for cinematographer John Conroy's work: [...] "The cinematography was beautiful. Broadchurch <b>always</b> <b>looks</b> fabulously bucolic but tonight the lovely summer dawns and countryside was shown off to an even greater degree..." [...] He also lauded Olivia Colman's performance, calling her [...] "once again on top form".|$|E
