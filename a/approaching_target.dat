50|$|As the photocontrast channel {{provides}} effective head-on engagement ability, {{firing range}} against an <b>approaching</b> <b>target</b> can be considerably {{longer than the}} maximum ranges listed above, likewise maximum firing range would be considerably less than the maximum range of target destruction against a receding target.

5000|$|According to {{a number}} of Russian sources the {{original}} 9M31 (US DoD designation SA-9A [...] "Gaskin-Mod0") had a zone of reliable target destruction from 900 to 4200 metres. Several western and also some Russian sources give much higher range estimates of 800 to 6500 m (0.5 to 4 miles); these may refer to maximum firing range against an <b>approaching</b> <b>target</b> and minimum against receding, which are obviously larger envelopes as the target only has to reach the intercept zone by the time the missile would reach it.|$|E
5000|$|The British adopted [...] "effective ceiling", {{meaning the}} {{altitude}} {{at which a}} gun could deliver a series of shells against a moving target; this could be constrained by maximum fuse running {{time as well as}} the guns capability.

Thoroughly shaken, but suffering only superficial damage, Gabilan evaded her antagonist in a providential heavy rain squall.

The trials, which were spread over ten days, were declared successful after the missile hit the target on five occasions. Multiple targets handling capability of Akash weapon system was demonstrated by live firing in C4I environment. Before the ten-day trial at Chandipur, ECCM Evaluation tests {{were carried out}} at Gwalior Air force base and mobility trials were carried out in Pokhran. The IAF had evolved the user Trial Directive to verify the Akash's consistency. The following trials were conducted: Against low-flying near-range target, long-range high-altitude target, crossing and <b>approaching</b> <b>target</b> and ripple firing of two missiles from the same launcher against a low-altitude receding target.|$|E
50|$|If an {{underwater}} object is moving relative to {{an underwater}} receiver, {{the frequency of}} the received sound is {{different from that of the}} sound radiated (or reflected) by the object. This change in frequency is known as a Doppler shift. The shift can be easily observed in active sonar systems, particularly narrow-band ones, because the transmitter frequency is known, and the relative motion between sonar and object can be calculated. Sometimes {{the frequency of the}} radiated noise (a tonal) may also be known, in which case the same calculation can be done for passive sonar. For active systems the change in frequency is 0.69 Hz per knot per kHz and half this for passive systems as propagation is only one way.

50|$|The missile is {{fitted with}} a {{cryogenic}} liquid nitrogen gas-cooled IR seeker capable of +/-40 degree off boresight angles. Flight control is by long span pointed delta fins {{at the front of}} the missile with Sidewinder-type slipstream driven rollerons on the aft tail fin surfaces to prevent roll and so enhance the operation of the guidance system. The missile has a maximum effective range of 35 km and an altitude limit of 6.5 km. The single-shot hit probability for a single missile launch at an <b>approaching</b> <b>target</b> is 90%. The missile can be used at a stand-alone system, or as a part of the Type 390 (DK-9) brigade (regiment)-level combined AAA/SAM air defence system. The missile entered production in 1991 and saw limited service with the PLA ground forces.|$|E
50|$|The 9K38 Igla (NATO {{reporting}} name is S-18 Grouse) is a 72.2 mm man-portable {{air defense}} missile weighing 10.6 kilograms with a 1.3 kilogram warhead. The missile itself is 1.67 meters long, the container is 1.708 meters {{and the whole}} system weights 17 kilograms. The system is designed to engage fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, cruise missiles and UAVs flying at speeds of 360-400 m/s in head-on engagement (<b>approaching</b> <b>target)</b> and up to 320 m/s in tail chase (receding target) within their optical visibility and in the night-time conditions in background clutter and thermal countermeasures environment. The system uses thermal battery/gas bottle, and is armed with a high-explosive warhead fitted with a contact and grazing fuse. The missile has a maximum range of 5200 meters and operates at altitudes from ten and up to 3500 meters. The 9M39 missile SA-18 employs an IR (infrared) guidance system using proportional convergence logic. The new seeker offers better protection against electro-optical jammers; the probability of kill against an unprotected fighter is estimated at 30-48%, {{and the use of}} IRCM jammers only degrades this to 24-30%.|$|E

In addition, we investigated the visibility for the motion toward themiddle of two eyes including when the target image falling on the blind spot of oneeye; then found that the visibility of moving target was increased extremely insidethe blind spot.
