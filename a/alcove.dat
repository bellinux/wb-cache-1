We call a set of points in an <b>alcoved</b> polytope a {{generating}} set if there exists no strictly smaller <b>alcoved</b> polytope containing it. The type A <b>alcoved</b> polytopes are precisely the convex polytopes that are also tropically convex. In this case the tropical generators form a generating set. We show that for any root system other than F 4, every <b>alcoved</b> polytpe invariant under the natural Weyl group action has a generating set of cardinality equal to the Coxeter number of the root system. 1...|$|R

5|$|There {{were several}} cottages on the estate, {{the first of}} which, The Beeches, was built for the Fox family. Swiss Cottage, which was built in 1819, was {{originally}} known as Carysfoot Cottage, when the Earl of Carysfort was a patient there. Lanesborough Cottage was built as accommodation for Lord Lanesborough. The lodge house was originally called the wheelhouse as it contained the mechanism used to open and close the iron gates to the asylum. A garden <b>alcove</b> dating from around 1820 is a Grade II listed building.|$|E

This class of convex polytopes includes many classical polytopes, for example, the hypersimplices. We compare two constructions of triangulations of hypersimplices due to Stanley and Sturmfels and explain them in terms of <b>alcoved</b> polytopes. We study triangulations of <b>alcoved</b> polytopes, the adjacency graphs of these triangulations, and give a combinatorial formula for volumes of these polytopes.

5|$|This {{multi-storied}} ruin, {{the best-known}} cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde, {{is located in}} the largest <b>alcove</b> {{in the center of the}} Great Mesa. It was south- and southwest-facing, providing greater warmth from the sun in the winter. Dating back more than 700 years, the dwelling is constructed of sandstone, wooden beams, and mortar. Many of the rooms were brightly painted. Cliff Palace was home to approximately 125 people, but was likely an important part of a larger community of sixty nearby pueblos, which housed a combined six hundred or more people. With 23 kivas and 150 rooms, Cliff Palace is the largest cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde National Park.|$|E
5|$|When {{the house}} and gardens were {{inherited}} by Coplestone Warre Bampfylde (1720–91) in the 18th century, a Georgian landscape garden was laid out, containing ponds, a grand cascade, a gothick <b>alcove,</b> a Tuscan temple arbour (1786), and a folly mausoleum. Bampfylde was an amateur architect of talent and a friend and adviser to Henry Hoare who laid out the gardens at Stourhead. Bampfylde also designed a Doric temple for the grounds, which was built around 1786, with an ashlar tetrastyle prostyle fronted by Tuscan columns and a large modillioned pediment. A Victorian formal parterre was added near the house by Henry Hall in the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|A stable {{block is}} at the north-west of Saltwell Towers, built in 1871 in the same style as the mansion in red brick and with a slate roof. This is a Grade II listed {{building}} and is now an educational area for schools and local community groups. Also to the north-west of Saltwell Towers is the Charlton Memorial Drinking Fountain, a stone and granite fountain inscribed in memory of George Charlton, the mayor of Gateshead between 187475. This is Grade II listed, as is the 'Salte Well' at the west entrance to the central section of the park. The latter is dated 1872 and is a sandstone construction with a basin in the central <b>alcove.</b> Midway along the Broadwalk in the north section of the park is a Grade II listed bronze statue of Alderman John Lucas, mounted on a sandstone plinth and granite base. Built in 1902, it was paid for by public subscription. The wrought iron gates and accompanying stone piers which greet visitors at the north-eastern entrance to the park are also Grade II listed.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Stream-restoration {{projects}} are usually {{designed to improve}} habitat quality for fishes. These projects manipulate flow patterns, substrate distribution, and amount and placement of large woody debris. Consequently, they also affect the size and composition of the aquatic macroinvertebrate community. This research evaluates two types of fish habitat restoration: off-channel structures (<b>alcoves)</b> and in-channel structures (log weirs). I compared macroinvertebrate habitats and communities in natural and artificial <b>alcoves</b> in Upper and South Fork Lobster Creeks, Lane Co., and {{examined the effects of}} log weirs on in-channel habitat diversity, community composition, drift patterns, and fish consumption of macroinvertebrates. Macroinvertebrate samples were collected from artificial and natural <b>alcoves</b> using hand pumps and D-nets. Within the channel, macroinvertebrates were collected from restored and unrestored reaches with a Hess sampler and using a stratified random sampling scheme. Forty-eight hour invertebrate drift samples were obtained at outlets of log-weir pools. Stomach contents were obtained from coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and cutthroat trout (O. clarki) in restored reaches. Although natural <b>alcoves</b> differed from artificial in location within the floodplain, morphology, permanence, and degree of interaction with the stream channel, both alcovetypes provided similar habitats and contained similar macroinvertebrate communities. Average densities and diversity within the <b>alcoves</b> depended on habitat and time of year. Average densities were higher in artificial than in natural. <b>Alcoves</b> contained 29...|$|R

40|$|Off-channel {{features}} such as <b>alcoves</b> and side channels can have important ecological functions for large rivers such as the Willamette River. Some species and age classes of fish may select these features instead of the main channel to feed, avoid predation by other fish, escape fast water, or seek out cool water in the summer. Other organisms such as amphibians, mussels, and birds may also be attracted to <b>alcoves</b> and side channels because of unique physical and water quality characteristics. This proposal describes research to evaluate the functions of <b>alcoves</b> and side channels in a large river ecosystem, determine factors that currently affect their ecological functions, and identify future management actions that could be taken to improve these functions. In addition, the authors intend to relate the processes occurring within <b>alcoves</b> and side channels to processes occurring in the main channel, in adjacent ground water, and the riparian vegetative community...|$|R

5|$|Mesa Verde is {{best known}} for a large number of well-preserved cliff dwellings, houses built in <b>alcoves,</b> or rock {{overhangs}} along the canyon walls. The structures contained within these <b>alcoves</b> were mostly blocks of hard sandstone, held together and plastered with adobe mortar. Specific constructions had many similarities but were generally unique in form due to the individual topography of different <b>alcoves</b> along the canyon walls. In marked contrast to earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas, the cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde reflected a region-wide trend towards the aggregation of growing regional populations into close, highly defensible quarters during the 13th century.|$|R
