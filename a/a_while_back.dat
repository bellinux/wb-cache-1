"Fight Club" [...] was {{inspired}} by a [...] "long-lost nugget" [...] of a story that series creator Chris Carter had thought up <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>back</b> about [...] "mis-matched twins that had an almost nuclear reaction when they were around each other." [...] Steve Kiziak and Arlene Pileggi—David Duchovny's stunt double and Mitch Pileggi's wife, respectively—were chosen to play the Mulder and Scully look-alikes {{at the start of the}} episode.

500|$|The {{inspiration}} for [...] "Fight Club" [...] was a [...] "long-lost nugget" [...] that series creator Chris Carter had thought up <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>back.</b> He explained, [...] "I had this {{idea for a}} long time to do a story about mis-matched twins that had an almost nuclear reaction when they were around each other." [...] Carter began to write the episode at the same time as the pilot for the X-Files spin-off, The Lone Gunmen. Because of the [...] "insanity" [...] in juggling two scripts at once, many more [...] "crazy" [...] elements made it into [...] "Fight Club".

500|$|... "It's a SpongeBob Christmas!" [...] was {{the first}} {{full-length}} episode of the series to be produced in stop motion animation. Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh, and Christopher Finnegan animated it at Screen Novelties, while Caballero and Walsh served as the directors. Screen Novelties was chosen by the show's executives to execute the animation because they had already worked with them before in other several smaller projects. These include the revamping of the opening title sequence of the show for 2009's SpongeBob's Truth or Square. Walsh explained, [...] "They dug one of our shorts that we'd done <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>back,</b> which was called Graveyard Jamboree with Mysterious Mose, and wanted to have us apply our sensibilities to SpongeBob ... We {{come from the same}} planet as far as our sense of humor and comic sensibilities are concerned. But we also {{wanted to make sure that}} it felt like a SpongeBob episode." ...|$|E

Someone asked me to write a song and they told me the story, and you know {{it was kind of a}} moving concept or whatever. And I did it, and I was like you know it’s not necessarily what I like per se, but after doing the song over and over again and having people coming up to and saying, thank you for writing ‘Hero’ because it saved my life or it saved my father’s life or my brothers or sisters life, or something of that nature, I said I always have to sing that song when I’m performing because if I don’t, you never know who I’m leaving out and you know what, in times of my life I’ve had to turn to that song lyrically and flip it onto my own life and sing it to myself. So its from the ‘Music Box’ album, and it’s called ‘Hero', this is for you." ...|$|E

[...] "I finally got totally disillusioned with the last Sabbath album, and I much {{preferred}} the stuff I was writing to the stuff Sabbath were doing". Butler formed a solo project called GZR, and released Plastic Planet in 1995. The album contained the song [...] "Giving Up the Ghost", which was critical of Tony Iommi for carrying on with the Black Sabbath name, with the lyrics: You plagiarised and parodied / the magic of our meaning / a legend in your own mind / left all your friends behind / you can't admit that you're wrong / the spirit is dead and gone ("I heard it's something about me..." [...] said Iommi. [...] "I had the album given to me <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>back.</b> I played it once, then somebody else had it, so I haven't really {{paid any attention to}} the lyrics...

[...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that [...] "I saw [...] "Subway Hero" [...] <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>back,</b> and as I wrote in my column last week, my {{reaction}} to it was roughly {{the same as it was}} to [...] "MILF Island": a number of very funny individual moments, but an episode that was less than the sum of its parts." [...] David Hinckley of The New York Daily News said that there were [...] "a lot of former-boyfriend gags that are, once again, well-formulated" [...] in this episode and that [...] "They work." [...] Hinckley also wrote that [...] "the real reason [...] is must-see TV is a guest spot by Tim Conway as an old-time television star whose deadpan recollections of the [...] "good old days" [...] keep getting weirder and funnier.

2500|$|Due to the agreement, Doom was {{recommended}} by Nathaniel and Valeria Richards to {{be a member}} of the Future Foundation. Objecting, Thing attacks Doom out of anger, but the fight was stopped by Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman, who welcomes Victor to their group. When Valeria asks Victor if he has a backup for restoring his memories, he reveals that Kristoff Vernard is his backup. Afterward, Mister Fantastic, Spider-Man, Nathaniel, Valeria, and Victor head to Latveria to meet with Kristoff and request his help. Mister Fantastic sets up a brain transfer machine in order to help restore Victor's memories and knowledge, which is successful. When Kristoff wants to return the throne to him, Doom states that it is not time yet because of a promise he made to Valeria. When Mister Fantastic asks what promise Doom made to Valeria, Victor states that he made a promise to help her defeat Mister Fantastic when she calls for it. Doom decides to hold a symposium on how to finally defeat Reed Richards. The Thing and the evolved Moloids give an invitation to the High Evolutionary. Dragon Man and Alex Power give an invitation to Diablo. Upon receiving an invitation from Spider-Man, Mad Thinker is convinced to take part in the event.
