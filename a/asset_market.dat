40|$|This Article {{analyzes}} {{whether the}} introduction of new derivative assets makes a society better or worse off. Because trading such non-redundant derivatives produces new distributions of income across time and over possible future contingencies, individuals can utilize such financial instruments to hedge risks not possible before {{the introduction of}} these assets. Thus, it may seem that new derivatives unambiguously benefit society. In fact, introducing sufficiently many new derivatives completes <b>asset</b> <b>markets.</b> <b>Asset</b> <b>markets</b> are complete if trading on them can attain every possible payoff pattern of wealth across time and over possible future contingencies. The first fundamental theorem of welfare economics provides that if <b>asset</b> <b>markets</b> are complete and perfectly competitive, the resulting equilibrium allocation of assets, commodities, and risk is Pareto-efficient. Thus, new derivatives that complete <b>asset</b> <b>markets</b> are unambiguously socially desirable. But, from the perspective of most households, the empirical reality is that <b>asset</b> <b>markets</b> are severely incomplete. Trading on incomplete <b>asset</b> <b>markets</b> cannot achieve some distributions of money across time and over possible future contingencies. The recognition that <b>asset</b> <b>markets</b> are incomplete has three far-reaching implications for regulatory policy towards new derivatives. First, for most societies, the addition of new derivatives to sufficiently incomplete <b>asset</b> <b>markets</b> can make all households worse off. Second, for most societies, a regulator can make all households better off by reallocating existing asset portfolios without introducing any new assets. Third, although government regulation can in principle improve the social allocation of risk and the resulting levels of households 2 ̆ 7 utilities, it may not due to informational, decisional or political limitations on real world regulators. These important normative implications of an incomplete <b>asset</b> <b>markets</b> analysis inform the debate over how to regulate new derivatives...|$|R

This paper investigates how access to {{domestic and international}} <b>asset</b> <b>markets</b> moderates industry-affiliated individuals' preferences for protectionist trade policies. We consider an economy where individuals with industry-specific holdings of human and physical capital confront real-income risk due to uncertainty in the economy's terms of trade. White human capital is nontradeable, noncontingent <b>asset</b> <b>markets</b> permit the exchange of ownership of physical capital. We establish conditions by which domestic <b>asset</b> <b>markets</b> can create a consensus for free trade. These conditions would not in general {{be expected to be}} realized. We then proceed to show how the addition of access to international <b>asset</b> <b>markets</b> has a liberalizing influence on individuals' preferred trade policies, and how the internationally tradeable assets of an economy's nontraded-goods sector further liberalizes individuals' policy preferences. The predictions of the model are consistent with the greater proclivity to liberalization of trade policy in market economies with developed domestic <b>asset</b> <b>markets,</b> liberal foreign investment opportunities, and sizeable nontraded-goods sectors. The model is also consistent with observed historical trade policy phenomena...|$|R

Initially controversial, the framework, in which {{interest rates and}} other asset prices are determined by private arbitrage behavior, applies a rigorous foundation from thermodynamics [...] to portfolio management. Rutledge uses the framework to track <b>asset</b> <b>market</b> shifts and develop strategies that attract capital and build wealth, bridging the gap between macroeconomic analysis and portfolio management. Over {{the past twenty years}} he has used this framework on economic analysis, asset allocation, portfolio selection, business strategy, restructuring, acquisitions, and divestitures. Rutledge advises institutional and individual investors how to structure portfolios to take advantage of opportunities created by a temporary divergence of prices from Intrinsic Value. His advisory and speaking clients include governments, corporations, and financial institutions around the world.|$|E

40|$|In many industrialized economies, {{there is}} sharp {{contrast}} between rigid prices in product markets and volatile prices in commodity and <b>asset</b> <b>markets.</b> This paper presents {{an explanation of}} this phenomenon {{in the framework of}} imperfect competition and heterogeneous expectations. However, the driving force of excessive price sensitivity is different between commodity and <b>asset</b> <b>markets.</b> In commodity markets where firms determine quantity and price equates demand to supply, seller expectation heterogeneity implies sensitive prices. In <b>asset</b> <b>markets</b> with high transaction costs, more buyer expectation heterogeneity means more sensitive prices. Market integration is shown to increase this price sensitivity. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{how and why}} financial resources were channeled almost exclusively to specific <b>asset</b> <b>markets</b> in Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States in the late 1980 s. A decline in demand for funds by traditional borrowers, and a shift by savers from banks toward indirect securities investments were critical factors in all three cases.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a continuous-time two-country dynamic equilibrium model, {{in which the}} real exchange rates, asset prices, and terms of trade are jointly determined {{in the presence of}} nontradable goods. The model determines the relation between the financial markets and real goods markets in the world economy and their responses to various shocks under the home bias assumption. A positive domestic supply shock induces a positive return on the domestic <b>asset</b> <b>markets</b> and a deterioration of terms of trade that improves the foreign output and boosts the foreign <b>asset</b> <b>markets.</b> Demand shocks act in the opposite way. This model also analyses the impact of change in the relative price of nontradable to tradable goods on the terms of trade and <b>asset</b> <b>markets.</b> A higher productivity growth in tradable goods than in nontradable goods leads to a higher relative price of nontradable to tradable goods, which appreciates the real exchange rate, deteriorates the terms of trade, and depresses the domestic and foreign <b>asset</b> <b>markets.</b> A lower relative price of nontradable goods depreciates the real exchange rate, improves the terms of trade, and lifts both the domestic and foreign <b>asset</b> <b>markets.</b> <b>Asset</b> price Nontradable goods Real exchange rate Terms of trade...|$|R

In other words, money is not only chasing goods and services, but to a larger extent, financial assets such as stocks and bonds. Their flows go into the capital account item of the balance of payments, thus balancing the deficit in the current account.

50|$|For {{input to}} the {{mathematical}} formulae, it's essential {{to focus on}} price and volume data subsequent to a reversal in trend and thus to {{a major change in}} <b>asset</b> <b>market</b> sentiment.Price-derived analytics such as moving averages deemphasize these critical changes and so mix periods of differing underlying market psychology, thus contaminating new shifts in accumulation and distribution. Moving averages also neglect market volume. By contrast, MIDAS algorithms locate the real order underlying asset prices at the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) taken over an interval subsequent to a reversal in trend.|$|E

40|$|The {{conduct of}} US {{monetary}} policy is {{often accompanied by}} controversial debates on the adequacy of monetary conditions.

The paper analyzes the theoretical and empirical information content of these concepts for <b>asset</b> <b>markets.</b> The analysis classifies, reviews and assesses measures of monetary conditions.

All excess liquidity measures are estimated and compared in the light of recent US asset bubbles. The analysis draws the following main conclusions. Firstly, not all measures of monetary conditions qualify as excess liquidity measure. Secondly, the increasing relevance of <b>asset</b> <b>markets</b> leads to growing distortions of excess liquidity measures. Thirdly, the choice of excess liquidity measure has influence on the assessment of monetary conditions in <b>asset</b> <b>markets.</b> ...|$|R
