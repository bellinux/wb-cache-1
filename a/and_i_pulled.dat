2500|$|Now {{continuing}} their {{career as a}} trio, with Ihsahn handling keyboards, vocals, guitars and bass, the band recorded their third album IX Equilibrium and toured Europe and North America. It was around 2000 when Samoth and Trym started to gravitate more towards death metal, while Ihsahn directed his musical exploration towards his side project, Peccatum. Thus, in 2001, Emperor decided to disband after releasing one final album, , composed entirely by Ihsahn. [...] Ihsahn later recalled that [...] "When we announced the split up in 2001, we didn't think we would do anything more with Emperor ever again...The decision was also based on the feeling that Emperor {{had a lot of}} integrity, and that {{if we were going to}} end it, we should end it while we still created great music. [...] For us, the decision was made in the black metal spirit. Since Samoth <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> in different directions, we didn't see any point in continuing. [...] The core of the band wasn't intact anymore". Samoth echoed Ihsahn's position: [...] "At that point, we both had other priorities that we wanted to pursue and we both felt that splitting up Emperor was the best thing to do. [...] We really wanted to focus on other things, and felt it was the only right thing to do".|$|E
60|$|I {{called to}} Euphemia {{and told her}} that I had found the old tavern sign. She came to look at it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> it out.|$|E
6000|$|The body of my brother's son, [...] Stood by me, knee to knee: [...] The body <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> at one rope, [...] But he said nought to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother {{took the}} oranges {{out of the}} knapsack, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> it up again. I told her that I had plenty more for myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{is married}} also, to her cousin, but I don't {{know that she}} has any {{children}} yet, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> never <b>pulled</b> her up any precipice. It was a man <b>I</b> <b>pulled,</b> a very heavy one. My arm isn't quite right yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just {{hand over}} that {{sapphire}} cross of yours, will you? We're all alone here, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could <b>pull</b> you to pieces like a straw doll." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We had a boat-hook, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> {{up to the}} island; I did, mother, and I made {{fast the}} boat to a little stick, and {{we went out to}} explore the island." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{took the}} {{opportunity}} of getting your horse out. Relieved of your weight, and loosened by the tide, he got his foot over the riata, and Charley <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> him out. If I am not mistaken, this is Mrs. Sepulvida?" ...|$|E
60|$|Galeotto, however, {{was in a}} deplorable case. He {{could not}} move a limb. He was {{exhausted}}--utterly and hopelessly exhausted with fatigue and want of sleep. Falcone <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> {{him to his feet}} between us; but he collapsed again, unable to stand.|$|E
6000|$|Jim {{indicated}} the wheel-marks and told Jake about the skidding. [...] "She went off {{at an angle}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> couldn't <b>pull</b> her round," [...] he concluded.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! I see--too many cooks apt {{to spoil}} the broth. Well, my mission will be to loaf about and see Bombay. You <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will <b>pull</b> together, Stumps." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "You <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{should not}} now {{pull on the}} ends of the rope in which you have tied a knot of war, because the harder you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>pull,</b> the tighter the knot will become. And a time may come when this knot is tied so tight that the person who tied it is no longer capable of untying it, and then the knot will have to be cut. What that would mean I need not explain to you, because you {{yourself}} understand perfectly what dreaded forces our two countries possess." ...|$|R
60|$|I let {{her come}} alongside, and then Juag <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> her in, she {{snapping}} and snarling {{at us as}} we did so; but, strange to relate, she didn't offer to attack us after we had ensconced her safely in the bottom alongside Raja.|$|E
60|$|I {{tried to}} reassure her, and {{to make light of}} the whole affair. I said that the fact evidently was that I was not rowing as fast as I fancied I was, but that we should soon reach the lock now; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> on for another mile.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sometimes it's {{hard to put}} you wise, {{but perhaps}} {{slipping}} back wasn't altogether right. I meant things were moving on and leaving me behind. The time I could be happy was going and soon I'd be old and sour. I didn't want to feel I'd done nothing and had never tasted life. Well, my chance came <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> out." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> here <b>I</b> again <b>pulled</b> out my pocket-book, {{and emptied}} the {{contents}} on the table.|$|R
6000|$|... "You imply {{it depends}} on the labor one uses?" [...] Jimmy remarked. [...] "Well, I know nothing about {{chopping}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> haven't <b>pulled</b> a crosscut saw. Do you think I can make good?" ...|$|R
60|$|Leaning {{over the}} side, with {{two pairs of}} gloves on, I caught the double line, <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>and</b> Dan reeled the fish came up nearer. But I could not see him. Then I reached the leader and held on as for dear life.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never saw}} any good come of favoring a snake," [...] Hiram grumbled; but yet he did not make any protest against my proposition, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> the gag {{from the mouth of}} the man who had worked us so much injury, saying at the same time as I seated myself near the bed, holding the knife which had been taken from its sheath: ...|$|E
60|$|There was a {{crowd of}} girls about us, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> myself up and looked among them like a Bashaw. They were all dressed out {{for the sake of}} the ship being in; and the women of Fales√° are a {{handsome}} lot to see. If they have a fault, they are a trifle broad in the beam; and I was just thinking so when Case touched me.|$|E
60|$|Now {{the bottle}} came slowly through. It {{was a small}} beer-bottle, I think, and several times I was afraid {{it was going to}} stick fast and cut off {{communication}} between me and the outer world--that is to say, between me and Agnes. But at last the cork and the neck appeared, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> it through. I did not drink any of it, but immediately applied my mouth to the tube.|$|E
500|$|Beghe {{was in an}} {{automobile}} accident in 1999. He said, [...] "I was intubated, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> kept <b>pulling</b> this tube out of my throat." [...] This has left him with a voice described as [...] "gravelly".|$|R
5000|$|On {{trying his}} hand on being a leading man of the 1940s: [...] "I thought I was Cary Grant. Oh, I looked into the mirror, and said, 'Yes, Yes. It's Cary Grant'. <b>And</b> then, <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> myself {{together}} <b>and</b> said, 'Are you kidding?' You're a character man." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{lay upon}} my belly across {{the wall and}} reached my hand far down toward him. With a little run from {{the centre of the}} cell he sprang up until I grasped his outstretched hand, <b>and</b> thus <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> him to the wall's top beside me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I ran {{on and on}} blindly now, passing all {{the shops}} and coming to {{a part of the}} road where there was a long grey row of private houses. I had, I know not why, an irrational feeling that I was a long iron bridge in empty space. An impulse seized me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> up the iron trap of a coal-hole. Looking down through it I saw empty space and the stairs.|$|E
60|$|Hiram gave no heed as Archie <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> {{the brave}} lad in; but was fumbling about {{in search of}} oars {{that it might be}} {{possible}} for him to guide the craft, and thus it was we were driven by the tempest from out the very midst of the Britishers where they must have been as thick as ants in a hill, although, fortunately for us, ill inclined to brave the fury of the blast in the open.|$|E
6000|$|The gigs had leaned {{to their}} right, but Hunter <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> {{straight}} in, {{in the direction}} of the stockade upon the chart. The two who were left guarding their boats seemed in a bustle at our appearance; [...] "Lillibullero" [...] stopped off, and I could see the pair discussing what they ought to do. Had they gone and told Silver, all might have turned out differently; but they had their orders, I suppose, and decided to sit quietly where they were and hark back again to [...] "Lillibullero." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, darling. I {{must show}} you my arrangements." [...] And she rose. [...] "This," [...] she said, [...] "you see, goes under there, and that under here; and that again goes under this. Then {{they all go}} under that, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> this. It's lovely." ...|$|R
60|$|Finally, {{and after}} what seemed to me a full ten minutes, I {{contrived}} to seize Job Lord by the arm, <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> at the limb Archie {{was able to get}} a hold on his throat, thus, as can well be imagined, bringing the fight to an end.|$|R
60|$|Presently I {{recalled}} the cord {{that had been}} attached to the parcel when it fell at my side, and after a little groping my hand {{came in contact with}} it again. It depended from above, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> upon it <b>I</b> discovered that it was rigidly fastened, possibly at the pit's mouth.|$|R
60|$|Made {{reckless}} by this, I {{stepped down}} to another branch {{directly over the}} bear, and tried again to rope him. It was of no use. He {{slipped out of the}} noose with the sinuous movements of an eel. Once it caught over his ears and in his open jaws. He gave a jerk that nearly pulled me from my perch. I could tell he was growing angrier every instant, and also braver. Suddenly the noose, quite by accident, caught his nose. He wagged his head <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled.</b> The noose tightened.|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon you're {{a little}} riled, aint ye?" [...] said the man; but I made him no answer, {{and left him}} to explain to Mr. Chipperton his remark about {{stealing}} the boat. They set off soon after me, {{and we had a}} race down the creek. I was [...] "a little riled," [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> so hard that the other boat did not catch up to me until we got out into the river. Then it passed me, but it didn't get to town much before I did.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{was talking}} to me about her father one day so tenderly and prettily, that she quite excited my {{interest}} about him," [...] begins Mr. Frank; [...] "and I asked her, among other things, what had occasioned his death. She said she believed it was distress of mind in the first instance; and added that this distress was connected with a shocking secret, which she and her mother had kept from everybody, but which she could not keep from me, because she was determined to begin her married life by having no secrets from her husband." [...] Here Mr. Frank began to get sentimental again, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> him up short once more with the paper-knife.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought I did, father. I {{may have}} been mistaken, but I {{certainly}} thought I heard a noise, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> the curtains aside the window was not shut by three or four inches. I will have a look through the shrubbery. That fellow may have come back again. Pull the curtains to after me." ...|$|R
60|$|ISABEL. I don't quite know--they were so far off. But {{this one}} was, oh, so big! {{and it had}} great wings, as wide as--twice over the ceiling. So, when it was picking up Sindbad, Florrie <b>and</b> <b>I</b> thought it wouldn't know if we got on its back too: so I got up first, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> up Florrie, <b>and</b> we put our arms round its neck, and away it flew.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I {{began to}} cogitate <b>and</b> wonder. <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> {{in the end}} of the signal-cord, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> found it had not been rubbed and torn by barnacles; the end of it had been clean cut with a knife. I remembered that this {{was the case with the}} air-tube; as I placed it into the bung-hole of the first {{hogshead}} I had noticed how smoothly it had been severed.|$|R
