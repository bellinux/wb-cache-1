5|$|Judge Vanaskie instead found {{guidance}} from the Supreme Court's 1994 holding in Waters v. Churchill, {{in which it}} had upheld an Illinois public hospital's dismissal of a nurse for her comments about a supervisor to a colleague, despite an ongoing factual dispute about the substance of those comments. The Court found that the hospital administration had made a reasonable attempt to investigate what the nurse had said before firing her. In that case, the Court had said explicitly that disciplining employees for things they did not <b>actually</b> <b>do</b> did not {{rise to the level}} of a constitutional violation.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{writes a}} love song for Marge, who seems {{completely}} oblivious to him until he tells her {{that he is in}} love with her. She explains to him that she loves Homer, and that he should tell his wife how he feels about her. He agrees, and decides to take Marge back to Homer and then get rid of Verity. When the two arrive in Springfield, Homer and the children are ecstatic to see Marge. However, Verity has already decided to leave Charles, and has found a new partner: Marge's sister Patty. They were brought together by their hatred for Homer and begin to insult him. When an offended Homer threatens to vote in favor of a law that prohibits same-sex couples from adopting children, Patty forces Homer into confessing that he is too lazy to <b>actually</b> <b>do</b> it. At the end of the episode, Homer plays a guitar and expresses his undying love for his newly bought plasma television and (to a lesser extent) Marge.|$|E

25|$|Any {{description}} of Tongan culture that limits itself to what Tongans see as anga fakatonga {{would give a}} seriously distorted view of what people <b>actually</b> <b>do,</b> in Tonga, or in diaspora, because accommodations are so often made to anga fakapālangi. The following account tries to give both the idealized and the on-the-ground versions of Tongan culture.|$|E
25|$|To get an {{appropriate}} example in a real-world problem, consider a diagnostic test {{that seeks to}} determine whether a person has a certain disease. A false positive in this case occurs when the person tests positive, but does not actually have the disease. A false negative, on the other hand, occurs when the person tests negative, suggesting they are healthy, when they <b>actually</b> <b>do</b> have the disease.|$|E

25|$|The {{king penguin}} {{is able to}} breed at three years of age, {{although}} {{only a very small}} minority (5% recorded at Crozet Islands) <b>actually</b> <b>do</b> then; the average age of first breeding is around 6 years. King penguins are serially monogamous. They have only one mate each year, and stay faithful to that mate. However, fidelity between years is only about 29%. The long breeding cycle may contribute to this low rate.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} {{consciousness}} {{can refer to}} voluntary action, awareness, or wakefulness. However, even voluntary behaviour involves unconscious mechanisms. Many cognitive processes {{take place in the}} cognitive unconscious, unavailable to conscious awareness. Some behaviours are conscious when learned but then become unconscious, seemingly automatic. Learning, especially implicitly learning a skill, can take place outside of consciousness. For example, plenty of people know how to turn right when they ride a bike, but very few can accurately explain how they <b>actually</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E
25|$|Cannibalism {{has been}} {{occasionally}} practiced {{as a last}} resort by people suffering from famine, including in modern times. Famous examples include the ill-fated Westward expedition of the Donner Party (1846–47) and, more recently, the crash of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 (1972), after which some survivors ate the bodies of dead passengers. Also, some mentally ill people obsess about eating others and <b>actually</b> <b>do</b> so, such as Jeffrey Dahmer and Albert Fish. There is resistance to formally labeling cannibalism as a mental disorder.|$|E
25|$|Gilovich {{offers two}} {{different}} explanations for why people believe hot hands exist. The {{first is that}} a person may be biased towards looking for streaks before watching a basketball game. This bias would then affect their perceptions and recollection of the game (confirmation bias). The second explanation deals with people’s inability to recognize chance sequences. People expect chance sequences to alternate between the options more than they <b>actually</b> <b>do.</b> Chance sequences can seem too lumpy, and are thus dismissed as non-chance (clustering illusion).|$|E

25|$|Families who {{say they}} have run out of {{pharmaceutical}} options have moved to Colorado to access Charlotte's Web. The demand has spurred calls for more research to determine whether these products <b>actually</b> <b>do</b> what is claimed. Amy Brooks-Kayal, vice president of the American Epilepsy Society, stated that epileptic seizures may come and go without any obvious explanation, and that Charlotte's web could cause developmental harm. She recommended that parents relocate so that their affected children could have access to one of the nation's top pediatric epilepsy centers rather than move to Colorado.|$|E

Evolutionary psychology approaches self-deception as an adaptation that can improve one's results in social exchanges.|$|E
25|$|Although artisanal logging {{provides}} some {{income for the}} community in the short-run, it ultimately does not improve local living conditions. In the end, the communities receive payments which are not large {{enough to cover the}} loss of their natural resources. Since there is no monitoring mechanism, the loggers report lower harvested amounts than they <b>actually</b> <b>do</b> in order to pay less tax to the local government. Some loggers cut one tree within the woods and leave the rest intact to mimic natural disturbance. To improve the situation, the DRC government needs better monitoring and better forest code to manage the logging activities.|$|E

25|$|As Jewish {{thought in}} Babylonia declined, the {{tolerance}} of al-Andalus {{made it the}} new centre of Jewish intellectual endeavours. Poets and commentators like Judah Halevi (1086–1145) and Dunash ben Labrat (920–990) contributed to the cultural life of al-Andalus, but the area was even {{more important to the}} development of Jewish philosophy. A stream of Jewish philosophers, cross-fertilizing with Muslim philosophers (see joint Jewish and Islamic philosophies), culminated with the widely celebrated Jewish thinker of the Middle Ages, Maimonides (1135–1205), though he did not <b>actually</b> <b>do</b> any of his work in al-Andalus, his family having fled persecution by the Almohads when he was 13.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, Heseltine was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of Heath, who was suffering from an open rebellion against his leadership by Enoch Powell and Ronald Bell. Heath attempted to persuade Heseltine to challenge Bell – both men's seats were to be abolished in the forthcoming round of boundary changes – for the Conservative nomination for the new seat of Beaconsfield. Bell's campaign within the local Conservative ranks was masterminded by Hugh Simmonds, chairman of the Young Conservatives, and he narrowly won. Heseltine wrote that he was “tempted” to enter the lists at Beaconsfield, but did not <b>actually</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E
25|$|Virginia Fortna of Columbia University, however, {{holds that}} {{peacekeeping}} interventions <b>actually</b> <b>do</b> substantively matter following {{the end of}} a civil war. She claims that selection bias, where opponents point only to failed peacekeeping interventions and do not compare these missions to those situations where interventions do not occur, is partly to blame for criticisms. Fortna says that peacekeeping missions rarely go into easily resolvable situations while they are sent into tougher, more risky post war situations where missions are more likely to fail, and peace agreements are unlikely to be committed to. When all factors of a certain peacekeeping case study are properly considered, Fortna shows that peacekeeping missions do in fact help increase the chances of sustained peace after a civil war.|$|E
