25|$|TeX {{provides}} <b>an</b> unusual <b>macro</b> language; {{the definition}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>macro</b> not only includes <b>a</b> list <b>of</b> commands {{but also the}} syntax of the call. Macros are completely integrated with a full-scale interpreted compile-time language that also guides processing. TeX's macro level of operation is lexical, but it is <b>a</b> built-in facility <b>of</b> TeX, that makes use of syntax interpretation. Comparing with most widely used lexical preprocessors like M4, it differs slightly, as the body <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>macro</b> gets tokenized at definition time, that is, it is not completely raw text. Except for a few very special cases, this gives the same behaviour. The TeX macro language has been successfully used to extend TeX to, for instance, LaTeX and ConTeXt.|$|R
