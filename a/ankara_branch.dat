The figure, based on estimates provided by glass suppliers {{on the cost of}} glass with similar qualities, is about half of the total official cost of the entire palace, TL 1.37 billion. There was also controversy due to the extensive use of imported marble at Euro 3,000 per square meter.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 76 - 85). This study explores {{the impacts of}} physical environmental items (DINESCAPE) on emotions and behavioral intentions of customers at an upscale restaurant. The theoretical framework is grounded on the Mehrabian- Russell model which suggests that any environment will evoke {{one of the three}} emotional states: pleasure, arousal, and dominance. A field study approach is used in this study and conducted with 152 participants who were dining at a restaurant. Among upscale restaurants in <b>Ankara,</b> two <b>branches</b> of Midpoint chain restaurants were selected as the case study to evaluate the influence of the DINESCAPE items in evoking emotional states that have an impact on behavioral intentions of customers.

Ankara University opened TÖMER branches in the Republic of Northern Cyprus, as well as in Berlin and Frankfurt; however, these branches were short-lived.

In time, some of these TÖMER branches - such as those in Eskişehir, Konya and Edirne - were closed down while some new additions - Alanya, Ankara ORAN, Denizli, and the like - were set up.To the February, 2014, there are 11 branches and a central office in TÖMER.
