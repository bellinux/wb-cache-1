25|$|In Faraday's {{model of}} {{electromagnetic}} induction, a circuit received an induced current when it cut lines of magnetic flux. According to this model, the Faraday disc should have worked when either the disc or the magnet was rotated, but not both. Faraday attempted {{to explain the}} disagreement with observation by assuming that the magnet's field, complete with its lines of flux, remained stationary as the magnet rotated (a completely accurate picture, but maybe not intuitive in the lines-of-flux model). In other words, the lines of flux have their own frame of reference. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> see in the next section, modern physics (since {{the discovery of the}} electron) does not need the lines-of-flux picture and dispels the paradox.|$|E
25|$|It {{was said}} that Nottingham could not support a tramway company; that there was this, that, and the other special reason why {{it would be all}} moonshine in Nottingham. It was said again that the uneven roads would necessitate the {{employment}} of too many extra horses to make the company pay; but these prognosticators did not know that uneven roads create traffic; that people are ever ready to jump into a car, and even pay a full fare to simply ride {{to the top of a}} hill. Now it happens that these prophets are without honour in their native land. The tramways company is a great success in the town, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> see very soon. The first section was opened on September the 18th last year, the running being to and from the Railway Stations, the Trent Bridge , and St. Peter's Church. On that first day 2,277 persons were carried in four inside cars, which were worked by 27 horse, the fare being twopence all the way. But here is something rather good. In the week ending October the 5th (Goose Fair week mind) no fewer than 32,619 persons were carried in five cars; and this result was said by experienced men to be unparalleled in the history of tramways.|$|E
25|$|Higher {{authority}} is represented most clearly by Peter. What is more, he represents it {{in a way}} which sets him apart from the mass of humanity and even (so Pushkin hints, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> see) from such run-of-the-mill autocrats as Alexander I. Only in the first twenty lines of the poem does Peter appear as a living person.The action then shifts forward abruptly by a hundred years, {{and the rest of the}} poem is set in a time when Peter is obviously long since dead. Yet despite this we have a sense throughout of Peter’s living presence, as if he had managed to avoid death in a quite unmortal way. The section evoking contemporary St Petersburg– Peter’s youthful creation, in which his spirit lives on–insinuates the first slight suggestion of this. Then comes a more explicit hint, as Pushkin voices the hope that the Finnish waves will not ‘disturb great Peter’s ageless sleep’. Peter, we must conclude, is not dead after all: he will awake from his sleep if danger should at any time threaten his capital city, the heart of the nation. Peter appears not as an ordinary human being but as an elemental force: he is an agent in the historical process, and even beyond this he participates in a wider cosmic struggle between order and disorder.|$|E

25|$|Pangeran Puger {{took the}} title of Pakubuwana I upon his {{accession}} in June 1704. The conflict between Amangkurat III and Pakubuwana I, the latter allied with the Dutch, usually termed First Javanese War of Succession, dragged on for five years before the Dutch managed to install Pakubuwana. In August 1705, Pakubuwono I’s retainers and VOC forces captured Kartasura without resistance from Amangkurat III, whose forces cowardly turned back when the enemy reached Ungaran. Surapati’s forces in Bangil, near Pasuruan, was crushed by the alliance of VOC, Kartasura and Madura in 1706. Jangrana II, who tended to side with Amangkurat III and did not venture any assistance to the capture of Bangil, was called to present himself before Pakubuwana I and murdered there by VOC’s request in the same year. Amangkurat III ran away to Malang with Surapati’s descendants and his remnant forces but Malang was then a no-man’s-land who offered no glory fit for a king. Therefore, though allied operations to the eastern interior of Java in 1706–08 did not gain much success in military terms, the fallen king surrendered in 1708 after being lured with the promises of household (lungguh) and land, but he was banished to Ceylon along with his wives and children. This {{is the end of}} Surabayan faction in Mataram, and– <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> see later– this situation would ignite the political time bomb planted by Sultan Agung with his capture of Surabaya in 1625.|$|E
500|$|Walsingham {{was driven}} by Protestant zeal to counter Catholicism, and sanctioned the use of torture against Catholic priests and {{suspected}} conspirators. Edmund Campion was among those tortured and found guilty {{on the basis of}} extracted evidence; he was hanged, drawn and quartered at Tyburn in 1581. Walsingham could never forget the atrocities against Protestants he had witnessed in France during the Bartholomew's Day massacre and believed a similar slaughter would occur in England {{in the event of a}} Catholic resurgence. Walsingham's brother-in-law Robert Beale, who was in Paris with Walsingham at the time of the massacre, encapsulated Walsingham's view: [...] "I think it time and more than time for us to awake out of our dead sleep, and take heed lest like mischief as has already overwhelmed the brethren and neighbours in France and Flanders embrace us which be left in such sort <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> not be able to escape." [...] Walsingham tracked down Catholic priests in England and supposed conspirators by employing informers, and intercepting correspondence. Walsingham's staff in England included the cryptographer Thomas Phelippes, who was an expert in deciphering letters and forgery, and Arthur Gregory, who was skilled at breaking and repairing seals without detection.|$|E

2500|$|From the Knights of Labor to the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), {{with all}} of the {{industrial}} unions and federations in between, the nature of union organization has been in contention for a very long time, and the philosophies of industrial unionism are inter-related.

Furthermore, some see a connection between Eliade's essentialism with regard to religion and fascist essentialism with regard to races and nations.

However, Ellwood admits that common tendencies in [...] "mythological thinking" [...] may have caused Eliade, as well as Jung and Campbell, to view certain groups in an [...] "essentialist" [...] way, and that this may explain their purported antisemitism: [...] "A tendency to think in generic terms of peoples, races, religions, or parties, which <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> see is undoubtedly the profoundest flaw in mythological thinking, including that of such modern mythologists as our three, can connect with nascent anti-Semitism, or the connection can be the other way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later in {{the same}} book, an essay from Shakespeare critic Garret A.

Sonnet Four follows these very themes with the speaker praising his friend, the young man, for his beauty, he moves on to say that his friend not having children would be inexcusable, when he says [...] "Then how when nature calls thee to be gone: What acceptable audit canst though leave?" [...] (lines 11–12) Here the speaker is using the unpredictability of nature to try to convince his friend to hurry up and have children. He also tries to appeal to his friend's emotions by saying, [...] "For having traffic with thyself alone, / Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive" [...] (lines 9-10). The speaker is saying that is wrong and deceives the friend's own self if he decides to remain single and childless. Line 11 also contains a sexually suggestive play on words when the speaker says [...] "having traffic with thyself alone". The idea of being alone is used by the speaker as being the pathetic alternative to marrying and having a family.|$|E
