The x= 0. 5 material is antiferromagnetic below T_N= 3. 75 K and superconducting below T_c= 0. 8 K. Muon spin realxation spectra show the gradual onset of damped coherent oscillations characteristic of magnetic order below T_N.

Using functional renormalization group equations we calculate {{the effect of}} quantum fluctuations on the fermionic self-energy parametrized by a wavefunction renormalization, an effective Fermi radius and the gap. This allows us to follow the modifications of the Fermi surface and the dispersion relation for fermionic excitations throughout the whole crossover region. We also determine the critical temperature of the second order phase transition to superfluidity. Our results are in agreement with BCS theory including Gorkov's correction for small negative scattering length a and with an interacting Bose gas for small positive a. At the unitarity point the result for the gap at zero temperature agrees well with Quantum-Monte-Carlo simulations while the critical temperature differs.

Here we discuss the difficulties connected with this energy reconstruction for the ongoing experiments MiniBooNE and T 2 K. We point out that a lower limit to the uncertainty in the reconstructed energy from Fermi motion alone amounts to about 15 %. The entanglement of very different elementary processes, in this case quasielastic scattering and pion production, in the actual observables leads to considerably larger errors. We discuss the sensitivity of the energy reconstruction to detection techniques and experimental acceptances. We also calculate the misidentification cross section for electron appearance in the T 2 K experiment due to neutral pion production.

Using both analytical and numerical methods we solve the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the case when a cloud of atoms containing a vortex is released from a trap. In two dimensions we find the simple result that the time dependence of the cloud radius is given by (1 +ω^ 2 t^ 2) ^ 1 / 2, where ω is the trap frequency. We calculate and compare {{the expansion of the}} vortex core and the cloud radius for different numbers of particles and interaction strengths, in both two and three dimensions, and discuss the circumstances under which vortex states may be observed experimentally.

40|$|Perturbative QCD {{results in}} the MSbar scheme can be {{dramatically}} improved by switching to a scheme that accounts for the dominant power law dependence on the factorization scale in the operator product expansion. We introduce the ``MSR scheme'' which achieves this in a Lorentz and gauge invariant way. The MSR scheme has a very simple relation to MSbar, and can be easily used to reanalyze MSbar results. Results in MSR depend on a cutoff parameter R, {{in addition to the}} mu of MSbar. R variations can be used to independently estimate i) the size of power corrections, and ii) higher order perturbative corrections (much like mu in MSbar). We give two examples at three-loop order, the ratio of mass splittings in the B*-B and D*-D systems, and the Ellis-Jaffe sum rule as a function of momentum transfer Q in deep inelastic scattering. Comparing to data, the perturbative MSR results work well even for Q ~ 1 GeV, and the size of power corrections is reduced compared to those in MSbar.

40|$|We present {{observations}} of thermal emission from fifteen transneptunian objects (TNOs) made using the Spitzer Space Telescope. Thirteen of the targets {{are members of}} the Classical population: six dynamically hot Classicals, five dynamically cold Classicals, and two dynamically cold inner Classical Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs). We fit our observations using thermal models to determine the sizes and albedos of our targets finding that the cold Classical TNOs have distinctly higher visual albedos than the hot Classicals and other TNO dynamical classes. The cold Classicals are known to be distinct from other TNOs in terms of their color distribution, size distribution, and binarity fraction. The Classical objects in our sample all have red colors yet they show a diversity of albedos which suggests {{that there is not a}} simple relationship between albedo and color. As a consequence of high albedos, the mass estimate of the cold Classical Kuiper Belt is reduced from approximately 0. 01 Earth masses to approximately 0. 001 Earth masses. Our results also increase significantly the sample of small Classical KBOs with known albedos and sizes from 21 to 32 such objects.

40|$|We {{study the}} hadronic form factors of τ lepton decays τ→ K π(η) ν. We compute one loop {{corrections}} {{to the form}} factors using the chiral Lagrangian including vector mesons. The counterterms which subtract the divergence of the one-loop amplitudes are determined by using background field method. In the vector form factor, K^∗ resonance behavior is reproduced because the diagram with a vector meson propagator is included. We fit the data of the hadronic invariant mass spectrum measured by Belle by determining some of the counterterms of the Lagrangian. Besides the hadronic invariant mass spectrum, the forward-backward asymmetry is predicted. We also study the effect of CP violation of a two Higgs doublet model. In the model, CP violation of the neutral Higgs sector generates the mixing of CP even Higgs and CP odd Higgs. We show how the mixing leads to the direct CP violation of the τ decays and predict the CP violation of the forward-backward asymmetry. Comment: 51 pages, 16 figures.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the effect of Lu {{substitution}} on the spin dynamics of the Kondo insulator YbB 12 to clarify {{the origin of the}} spin-gap response previously observed at low temperature in this material. Inelastic neutron spectra have been measured in Yb 1 -xLuxB 12 compounds for four Lu concentrations x = 0, 0. 25, 0. 90 and 1. 0. The data indicate that the disruption of coherence on the Yb sublattice primarily affects the narrow peak structure occurring near 15 - 20 meV in pure YbB 12, whereas the spin gap and the broad magnetic signal around 38 meV remain almost unaffected. It is inferred that the latter features reflect mainly local, single-site processes, and may be reminiscent of the inelastic magnetic response reported for mixed-valence intermetallic compounds. On the other hand, the lower component at 15 meV is most likely due to dynamic short-range magnetic correlations. The crystal-field splitting in YbB 12 estimated from the Er 3 + transitions measured in a Yb 0. 9 Er 0. 1 B 12 sample, has the same order of magnitude as other relevant energy scales of the system and is thus likely {{to play a role in}} the form of the magnetic spectral response.

40|$|We present spectroscopic {{observations}} {{of a large}} sample of Herbig Ae stars in the 10 micrometer spectral region. We perform compositional fits of the spectra based on properties of homogeneous as well as inhomogeneous spherical particles, and derive the mineralogy and typical grain sizes of the dust responsible for the 10 μm emission. Several trends are reported that can constrain theoretical models of dust processing in these systems: i) none of the sources consists of fully pristine dust comparable to that found in the interstellar medium, ii) all sources with a high fraction of crystalline silicates are dominated by large grains, iii) the disks around more massive stars (M > 2. 5 M_sun, L > 60 L_sun) have a higher fraction of crystalline silicates than those around lower mass stars, iv) in the subset of lower mass stars (M < 2. 5 M_sun) there is no correlation between stellar parameters and the derived crystallinity of the dust. The correlation between the shape and strength of the 10 micron silicate feature reported by van Boekel et al. (2003) is reconfirmed with this larger sample. The evidence {{presented in this paper}} is combined with that of other studies to present a likely scenario of dust processing in Herbig Ae systems. We conclude that the present data favour a scenario in which the crystalline silicates are produced in the innermost regions of the disk, close to the star, and transported outward to the regions where they can be detected by means of 10 micron spectroscopy. Additionally, we conclude that the final crystallinity of these disks is reached very soon after active accretion has stopped. Comment: 22 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in A&A.
