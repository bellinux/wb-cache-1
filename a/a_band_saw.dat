5|$|Balabushka's {{first job}} {{was as a}} wooden toy {{designer}} and maker, working for the Educational Equipment Company, then located at 71 West 23rd St., in Manhattan, which made building blocks for nurseries and schools. Thereafter he built children's furniture for the Playtime Woodworking Company located on Greenwich Village's Jane Street. While on the job, Balabushka lost his middle finger to <b>a</b> <b>band</b> <b>saw.</b> Using a wooden mold, he made himself a replacement plastic finger of such craftsmanship that even his friends did not realize his loss until long after the incident. As Balabushka's carpentry skills deepened he began building accordions and other detailed carpentry pieces on his own time. In 1949, Balabushka applied for patent on a folding leg bracket mechanism he invented, which was granted in 1951.|$|E
25|$|The Museum {{consists}} {{of a number of}} historic buildings moved to a central site on the banks of a scenic ravine beside the tidal Greville River. The main building is a former 1854 Methodist Church. In addition to the original building the site is home to a cafe/gift shop, the Port Greville Lighthouse, a boat shed, a blacksmith shop and <b>a</b> <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> shed. Several walking trails lead from the museum to historic and natural features along the river.|$|E
25|$|An IoT-enabled {{intelligent}} system of such cases was proposed in 2001 and later demonstrated in 2014 by the National Science Foundation Industry/University Collaborative Research Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS) at the University of Cincinnati on <b>a</b> <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> machine in IMTS 2014 in Chicago. Band saw machines {{are not necessarily}} expensive, but the band saw belt expenses are enormous since they degrade much faster. However, without sensing and intelligent analytics, it can be only determined by experience when the band saw belt will actually break. The developed prognostics system {{will be able to}} recognize and monitor the degradation of band saw belts even if the condition is changing, advising users when {{is the best time to}} replace band saw. This will significantly improve user experience and operator safety and ultimately save on costs.|$|E
5000|$|A resaw is <b>a</b> large <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> {{optimized}} for cutting timber {{along the grain}} to reduce larger sections into smaller sections or veneers. Resawing veneers requires a wide blade - commonly 2 to 3 inches (52-78 mm) - with a small [...] to minimize waste. Resaw blades of up to 1 inch (26 mm) may be fitted to <b>a</b> standard <b>band</b> <b>saw.</b> Many small and medium-sized sawmills use 1- to -inch <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> blades.|$|R

2500|$|Townsend set up <b>a</b> <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> mill in Tuckaleechee, and {{the town}} {{that bears his name}} grew up in the vicinity. [...] He formed the Little River Railroad to connect the mill with the Southern Railroad {{terminal}} at nearby Walland, and with able engineers managed to lay railroad tracts {{all the way to the}} upper reaches of Little River and Jakes Creek.|$|E
2500|$|In 1901, Pennsylvania {{entrepreneur}} Colonel Wilson B. Townsend purchased [...] of land along Little River {{and established}} the Little River Lumber Company. Townsend set up <b>a</b> <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> mill in Tuckaleechee Cove, laying {{the foundation for}} the town that would later bear his name. [...] Rather than splash dams, which are {{at the mercy of the}} volatile mountain streams, Townsend constructed a logging railroad between the company's sawmill in Tuckaleechee and the river's upper reaches, all the way to the Three Forks area (where the river absorbs Fish Camp Prong and Rough Creek). [...] The railroad was later extended to Walland, connecting it to Maryville and Knoxville. [...] The railroad employed 10 Shay engines to move the log-filled flatcars along the river valley. [...] Logging skidders were used to pull trees from the steeper slopes. [...] Elkmont was established in 1908 as a transfer station where logs were moved from gear-operated trains (used for reaching higher elevations) to rod-operated trains for transport to the sawmill at Townsend.|$|E
50|$|Lever {{played as}} a fullback in his 15-year VFL career {{which began in}} 1905. In 1907 he lost two fingers in <b>a</b> <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> {{accident}} but after attending to the wound himself, played for St Kilda the following afternoon.|$|E

30|$|For histopathologic evaluation, tissue blocks {{containing}} the implant were dissected {{with a minimum}} of surrounding tissue immediately after explantation. After brief flushing with saline, specimens were fixed in formalin (buffered 4  %). Prior to embedding, macroscopic evaluation and photo documentation were accomplished. After fixation, tissue blocks {{containing the}} devices were embedded in resin methylmethacrylate (Technovit 9100, Kulzer & Co, Wehrheim, Germany). Following hardening, resin blocks were subsequently sectioned in slices of 0.8  mm using <b>a</b> diamond <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> (300 CP, Exakt GmbH, Norderstedt, Germany).

50|$|During one {{of these}} repair visits, Bettcher was told that if just a few ounces of meat on a carcass could be saved instead of lost to scrap, it could mean {{hundreds}} of thousands of dollars’ worth of increased yield and profits each year. With this knowledge as his inspiration, Bettcher invented and began to manufacture new machinery as World War II ended. One such tool was the Bettcher Carcass Splitter, <b>a</b> highly efficient <b>band</b> <b>saw.</b>|$|R
50|$|While {{somewhat}} similar to <b>a</b> <b>band</b> <b>saw,</b> a scroll saw uses a reciprocating blade {{rather than a}} continuous loop. Like a hand coping saw, the scroll saw's blade can be removed and placed through a pre-drilled starting hole, allowing interior cutouts to be made without an entry slot. Also, the fineness in both width and tooth count of a scroll's blade permits significantly more intricate curves than even the narrowest gauge band-saw blade.|$|E

50|$|Shake blocks {{are split}} into 1 inch thick slats called blanks, using either a {{hydraulic}} press with a blade attached, called a cuber, or split by hand using a froe and mallet. These blanks are uniform in thickness throughout if split {{from the same}} edge without flipping the block. Alternatively, the splitter may flip the block after a blank is taken off each edge, which results in a tapered split from end to end, called tapers or hand-split. The blanks which are not tapered require further processing before application to create this taper, and are run through <b>a</b> large <b>band</b> <b>saw,</b> pushed by hand to cut them from corner to corner forming a tapered shake, sawn on one face.|$|R
50|$|Band Filing {{takes place}} on a machine similar to a belt sander, used like <b>a</b> <b>band</b> <b>saw.</b> Band files are {{sectioned}} {{so that they can}} be made from stiff material, as they need to be to effectively remove material yet still work in a constant feed. A band filing operation can be used to remove small amounts of material with good accuracy.

50|$|Benching is the {{leveling}} and tensioning of the <b>saw.</b> When <b>a</b> <b>saw</b> <b>band</b> is {{run on a}} mill it {{is stretched}} with thousands of pounds of force, and during operation the cutting edge heats up. These forces and temperatures cause the saw to deform. Benching deforms an un-mounted saw {{in a way that}} counteracts the operating stresses, and allows the saw to pull flat and cut straight when in use. It takes months to learn benching.|$|R
