Webber stated that he enjoyed {{the first part of the}} event and was looking forward to the next race of the season. Kovalainen was issued with an reprimand for his role in the collision with de la Rosa. He admitted that he was at fault for causing the incident because he was allowing another car to pass him and had not seen de la Rosa approaching him. Force India's chief operating officer Otmar Szafnauer said the confusion resulting in the error of fitting the wrong tyres for both their drivers was an example of cause and effect. He wanted to disregard the issue <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to the next few races.

Attempting to explain the billion-dollar charge and calm investors, Enron's disclosures spoke of [...] "share settled costless collar arrangements," [...] "derivative instruments which eliminated the contingent nature of existing restricted forward contracts," [...] and strategies that served [...] "to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets." [...] Such puzzling phraseology left many analysts feeling ignorant about just how Enron managed its business.

The dress sparked controversy after a representative for designer Michael Angel—who helped Stefani with the design {{and worked as a}} stylist—alleged that it was Angel who created the gown, not Stefani. In response, Angel released a statement confirming that the dress was designed by Stefani for L.A.M.B. to wear and be auctioned off at the amfAR gala, adding, [...] "I'm disappointed that the focus has shifted away from what Gwen and I originally intended, which was to create a custom outfit for a great cause.

500|$|The viaduct {{was removed}} in 1999, but the {{architectural}} group Rigga persuaded {{the city to}} preserve the paintings and the columns. Rigga {{said that if the}} murals had been removed from the columns, [...] "much of their magic would be lost". The City of Portland's Office of Transportation earmarked funds to remove ten columns; an ad hoc committee called Friends of the Columns was formed to raise money for their storage, restoration and public display, which was estimated to cost $460,000. City Commissioner Charlie Hales said, [...] "Saving the Lovejoy columns and the artwork provides a real bridge between the rich history of this industrial area and its future as a residential neighborhood. I am pleased that we are able to save these columns <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to them being placed on some of the park spaces in the River District." [...] According to the James M. Harrison Art and Design Studio, [...] "Extracting the columns both captured the space created by Tom and preserved a ruin that would continue to tell a story. The fragile paintings preserved the mighty concrete." [...] During the next five years, attempts by the city, and non-profit and entrepreneurial groups to restore the columns were unsuccessful. Boora Architects' Northwest Marshall Street Pedestrian Bridge Feasibility Study (2001), funded by the Portland Development Commission, proposed installing the columns at the intersection of Northwest 9th Avenue and Naito Parkway.|$|E
