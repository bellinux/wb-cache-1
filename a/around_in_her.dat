5|$|After {{a time of}} {{not seeing}} Tigerstar, Sasha returns to her den one evening, only to find Tigerstar already waiting for her. Asking him where he was, he {{comments}} on how nice her den was, and then stops and asks when she will be seeing her humans again, after seeing her collar hanging around a protruding branch on the logs. Sasha asks him why he was snooping <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> den, and he tells her that he cannot see her any more if she has the collar. She refuses to destroy it, and quarrels with Tigerstar about housecats {{and how they are}} not independent. Sad, she reminisces about her perfect life with Jean and Ken.|$|E
5|$|Kramer {{is almost}} {{immediately}} out, {{due to the}} presence of a beautiful exhibitionist woman in the apartment across the street who walks <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> apartment naked with the curtains open. The others are distracted by various temptations: George is distracted in the hospital his mother is staying at by an attractive nurse giving an even more attractive woman a daily sponge bath; Elaine visits a fitness club which is also patronized by John F. Kennedy, Jr.; Jerry is tempted by the naked woman across the street and frustrated because the woman he's dating won't have sex with him since she wants to remain a virgin. One method he uses to distract himself is by watching wholesome shows like Tiny Toons on Nickelodeon.|$|E
5|$|Although Tsukudani kept a {{notebook}} with story ideas, she admitted that {{on many occasions}} the theme of a chapter {{was born out of}} her own daydreams. Once she decided on a theme, she had the characters move <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> head and then worked out the plot and storyboard. Since she had a solid grasp on who the characters were, she noted that they moved around for her on their own. Conversely, if the characters were stiff with a given theme, Tsukudani could not develop an interesting story and moved on to another idea. The theme developed for the manga serialized in Febri had to do with bonus aspects to the story that she was unable to draw in the main serialization, as well as events that occurred between chapters in the main story.|$|E

25|$|It {{emerged during}} the {{cross-examination}} of Fung and the other laboratory scientists that the police scientist Andrea Mazzola (who collected blood samples from Simpson to compare with evidence from the crime scene) was a trainee who carried the vial of Simpson's blood <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> lab coat pocket for nearly a day before handing it over as an exhibit. While two errors {{had been found in}} the history of DNA testing at Cellmark, one of the testing laboratories, in 1988 and 1989, the errors were found during quality control tests and had not occurred since. One of the companies hired for DNA consulting by Simpson's defense had made the same error as found in 1988. What should have been the prosecution's strong point became their weak link, amid defense accusations that police technicians handled the blood samples with such a degree of incompetence as to render the delivery of accurate and reliable DNA results almost impossible. The prosecution argued that they had made the DNA evidence available to the defense for its own testing, and if the defense attorneys disagreed with the prosecution's tests, they could have conducted their own testing on the same samples. The defense had chosen not to accept the prosecution's offer.|$|E

Silas is contacted by the police and tells them he is holidaying in France and denies any knowledge of the attack.|$|E
500|$|After the songwriting {{sessions}} {{ended with}} Nowels, Madonna started collaborating with Orbit and Leonard for recording the tracks. However, since Leonard could not delve much studio time, Madonna worked solely with Orbit. Around June 1997, the singer entered the Larrabee North Studio, Universal City, California {{to record the}} album, accompanied by Orbit, an engineer and a tape operator. According to Orbit, [...] "Most of the tracks pre-existed, so Madonna would work on vocals and lyrics at home, or driving <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> car." [...] The producer was initially uncomfortable with the singer around the studio checking the recording process, but gradually entered into a work dynamics with her. However, his disorganized nature almost got him fired when he reached Madonna's house to play [...] "The Power of Goodbye" [...] and {{realized that he had}} carried the wrong DAT file. Madonna was not impressed and Orbit had to [...] "virtually" [...] remain in the studio for a week and deliver the final track.|$|E

500|$|... "Shut Up and Drive" [...] is a {{new wave}} song that {{incorporates}} influences of the 1970s and 1980s musical styles. It samples New Order's 1983 single [...] "Blue Monday". The song contains an upbeat opening sequence with a heavy guitar riff. Tom Breihan from Pitchfork Media wrote that the song [...] "begins with über-processed new wave guitars that sort of sound like the Cars". According to a digital music sheet published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "Shut Up and Drive" [...] is written in the key of E major and is set in simple time with a moderately fast groove. Rihanna's vocal range spans from the low note of F#3 to the high note of B4 and the song follows a chord progression of E5–B5–C5–F5–B5–C5. Lyrically, [...] "Shut Up and Drive", as the title suggests, is about Rihanna looking for a driver, who will drive her <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> new car and take control over it.

2500|$|Music {{was one of}} {{the main}} comforts for Goodrem during the {{chemotherapy}} for Hodgkin's lymphoma cancer diagnosis. Songs kept going <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> head: harmonies, melodies, lyrics, many deeper and darker than those that were on her debut album, Innocent Eyes. Goodrem states [...] "It's a more grown up album", [...] "My music changed because my life had changed; the whole world around me had changed. My music had to reflect that". [...] "Extraordinary Day" [...] is about the day (8 July 2003) when she was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, [...] "The Last Night On Earth" [...] is a song about death and love, [...] "The Analyst" [...] tells the story of the hours of self-analysis she dealt with, [...] "Be Strong" [...] is an encouraging call for confidence and [...] "Mistaken Identity" [...] is Goodrem stating for the record where her head was at. She also stated [...] "There are a lot of lyrics I wouldn't have used on the first album".|$|E
2500|$|The Dove Foundation {{praised the}} film, {{saying it is}} [...] "one of those movies that you find {{to be better than}} anticipated" [...] and also said the film draws on realism in family dynamics. Lara Martin of Digital Spy {{described}} the film as a [...] "kid-friendly mix of Men in Black crossed with Gremlins with a healthy dose of Home Alone-style violence" [...] and also mentioned that one of the biggest disappointments in the movie is the lack of screen time given to Tisdale, billed as one of the leading actors, who gets a promising start as she rebels against her parents and struts <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> bikini, but she's quickly relegated to background fodder purely there to provide excess opportunities for the alien-controlled Ricky to shine and concluded saying it seems [...] "a bizarre and sad waste of her obvious comedic talent". However, The Miami Herald gave a mixed to negative review, saying the film is a [...] "children's movie mix of live-action and animation, it has a few positive messages, a few laughs and a few comic throwdowns".|$|E
