5|$|To Mahavira, {{the metaphysical}} {{nature of the}} {{universe}} consists of dravya, jiva, and ajiva. The jiva gets attached and bound to samsara (wordly realms of suffering and existence) because of karma (activity). Karma, in Jainism, includes both actions <b>and</b> <b>intent,</b> and it colors (lesya) the soul; its particles stick to the soul and affect how, where, and what the soul is instantaneously reborn into after a being dies.|$|E
5|$|By July 1803, {{citizens}} of the western states, desiring more representation {{in the federal government}} <b>and</b> <b>intent</b> on breaking the pattern of nominating a Virginians and New Yorkers for most important federal offices, were advocating Breckinridge's nomination as vice president in the 1804 presidential election. Thomas Jefferson was expected to be reelected, but most Democratic-Republicans had grown disenchanted with Vice President Aaron Burr; he would not be Jefferson's running mate. Breckinridge's service as Senate floor leader made him a natural choice.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Leigh and Laurence Olivier {{performed}} {{two plays}} about Cleopatra, William Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra and George Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra, alternating the play each night and winning good reviews. They took the productions to New York, where they performed a {{season at the}} Ziegfeld Theatre into 1952. The reviews there were also mostly positive, but film critic Kenneth Tynan angered them when he suggested that Leigh's was a mediocre talent that forced Olivier to compromise his own. Tynan's diatribe almost precipitated another collapse; Leigh, terrified of failure <b>and</b> <b>intent</b> on achieving greatness, dwelt on his comments and ignored the positive reviews of other critics.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access until 31 st Mar 2018. The {{extensive}} usage of smartphones {{has been the}} major driving force behind a drastic increase of new security threats. The stealthy techniques used by malware make them hard to detect with signature based intrusion detection and anti-malware methods. In this paper, we present PIndroid|a novel Permissions <b>and</b> <b>Intents</b> based framework for identifying Android malware apps. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, PIndroid is the first solution that uses a combination of permissions <b>and</b> <b>intents</b> supplemented with multiple stages of classifiers for malware detection. Ensemble techniques are applied for optimization of detection results. We apply the proposed approach on 1, 745 real world applications and obtain 99. 8 % accuracy which is the best reported to date. Empirical results suggest that our proposed framework built on permissions <b>and</b> <b>intents</b> is effective in detecting malware applications...|$|R

When Karman was late in telling Rifah his feelings, losing her to another man, the PKI manipulated his emotions to make him leave Islam and hate Haji Bakir. Ultimately this was successful: Karman abandoned his mandatory prayers and began to espouse the Party's politics. After Karman was refused marriage to Rifah a second time, following her husband's death, he had Haji Bakir imprisoned. In this time Karman married Marni, intending to convert her family to communism.|$|E
5|$|According {{to church}} doctrine, the sacraments {{of the church}} require the proper form, matter, <b>and</b> <b>intent</b> to be validly {{celebrate}}d. In addition, the Canon Laws for both the Latin Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches govern who may licitly celebrate certain sacraments, as well as strict rules about who may receive the sacraments. Notably, because the Church teaches that Christ {{is present in the}} Eucharist, those who are conscious of being in a state of mortal sin are forbidden to receive the sacrament until they have received absolution through the sacrament of Reconciliation (Penance). Catholics are normally obliged to abstain from eating {{for at least an hour}} before receiving the sacrament. Non-Catholics such are ordinarily prohibited from receiving the Eucharist as well.|$|E
5|$|Barbarian King Alrik– The former {{ruler of}} {{a horde of}} barbarians. As the {{champion}} of Hades, he sought the Ambrosia to save his ailing father. Alrik was ultimately unsuccessful and was killed by Kratos. Resurrected by Hades, Prince Alrik learned that he had become King {{after the death of}} his father. Alrik sought vengeance against Kratos, and his barbarian horde threatened to overwhelm Kratos' opposing Spartan army. Alrik almost killed Kratos in combat, but this was undone at the critical moment when Kratos offered up his life to Ares and was returned to battle equipped with the Blades of Chaos, which Kratos used to decapitate Alrik. Alrik eventually fought his way out of the Underworld, <b>and</b> <b>intent</b> on revenge, found and confronted Kratos on the Island of Creation. Kratos killed the Barbarian King once again, and took his hammer. The character was voiced by Bob Joles in God of War II, and Fred Tatasciore in God of War III during the psyche sequence.|$|E

5|$|While the production's lawyers {{worked to}} clarify its legal {{standing}} in the Summer of 2005, it emerged that Humbert Balsan's deeply indebted production company Ognon Pictures had pledged all rights to the production to Coficiné in exchange for loans. With production in legal stasis and faced with a lengthy court battle to recover the rights, the producers agreed to a settlement with Ognon's bankruptcy officer. In the meantime, the French partners Mezzanine Film declared their uncomfortableness with {{the scale of the}} production, and after mutual agreement with the producers, left the project on September 5, 2005. After meeting with the producers and their new French partner, Paul Saadoun of 13 Production, Coficiné consented to completing the film. On February 6, 2006, Tarr and producer Gábor Téni issued a press release which documented at length the developments with the troubled production to that date, and expressed their hope <b>and</b> <b>intent</b> to persevere in completing the film. Tarr duly restarted shooting in March 2006, after a year of inactivity. The filmmakers dedicated The Man from London to their late colleague Humbert Balsan.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of its {{military}} outcome, the Siege of Dubrovnik is primarily remembered for the large-scale looting by JNA troops and the artillery bombardment of Dubrovnik, especially its Old Town. The reaction of the international media and {{media coverage of the}} siege reinforced an opinion, already taking shape since the fall of Vukovar, that the conduct of the JNA and the Serbs was barbaric <b>and</b> <b>intent</b> on dominating Croatiaregardless of the destruction of priceless cultural heritage that occurred in the process. Serbian authorities thought the international community had no moral grounds to judge because they did not interfere when hundreds of thousands of Serbs were killed in Croatian concentration camps during World War II. Besides the protests made by Mayor Zaragoza, Vance and the ECMM, 104 Nobel Prize laureates published a full-page advertisement in The New York Times on 14 January 1992 at the incentive of Linus Pauling, urging governments throughout the world to stop the unrestrained destruction by the JNA. Because the siege shaped the international opinion of the Croatian War of Independence, it became a major contributor to a shift in the international diplomatic and economic isolation of Serbia and rump Yugoslavia, which came to be viewed as an aggressor-state in the West. On 17 December 1991, the European Economic Community agreed to recognize the independence of Croatia on 15 January 1992.|$|E

40|$|With the {{proliferation}} of Web services, when developing a new application, {{it makes sense to}} seek and leverage existing Web services rather than implementing the corresponding components from scratch. Therefore, significant research efforts have been devoted to the techniques for service discovery and integration. However, most of the existing techniques are based on the ternary participant classification of the Web service architecture which only takes into consideration the involvement of service providers, service brokers, and application developers. The activities of application end users are usually ignored. This thesis presents an Intents-based service discovery and integration approach at the conceptual level inspired by two industrial protocols: Android <b>Intents</b> <b>and</b> Web <b>Intents.</b> The proposed approach is characterized by allowing application end users to participate in the process of service seeking. Instead of directly binding with remote services, application developers can set an intent which semantically represents their service goal. An Intents user agent can resolve the <b>intent</b> <b>and</b> generate a list of candidate services. Then application end users can choose a service as the ultimate working service. This thesis classifies intents into explicit <b>intents,</b> authoritative <b>intents,</b> <b>and</b> naïve <b>intents,</b> <b>and</b> examines in depth the issue of naïve <b>intent</b> resolution analytically <b>and</b> empirically. Based on the empirical analysis, an adaptive intent resolution approach is devised. This thesis also presents a design for the <b>Intents</b> user agent <b>and</b> demonstrates its proof-of-concept prototype. Finally, <b>Intents</b> <b>and</b> the <b>Intents</b> user agent are applied to integrate Web applications and native applications on mobile devices...|$|R

25|$|The {{generally}} accepted theory about {{much of the}} earthwork attributes its construction to Offa, King of Mercia from 757 to 796.

This suggests that Mercians constructed it as a defensive earthwork, or to demonstrate the power <b>and</b> <b>intent</b> of their kingdom.|$|E
