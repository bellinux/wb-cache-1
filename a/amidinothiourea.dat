40|$|The {{synthesis}} of 3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazole via mercury(II) chloride-mediated cyclization of <b>amidinothiourea</b> is described. This procedure offers a general and efficient route to synthesize the title compound by 3 + 2 annulation reaction. On {{the basis of}} the literature precedence, the mechanism for the formation of 3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazole is proposed. When the synthesized compounds were tested for their antimicrobial activity showed promising inhibition against tested microbes...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} 2 -(4 -amino- 2 -aryl/alkylaminothiazol- 5 -oyl) {{benzothiazole}} derivatives were synthesized from <b>amidinothioureas</b> and 2 -(2 -bromoacetyl) benzothiazole with triethylamine. Their structures were established {{on the basis}} of IR, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR and mass spectral analyses. All the synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial, antifungal and antimycobacterial potential. All the compounds showed significant activity against the microorganisms tested...|$|R
