Five 15 -year old Pinus caribeae (Morelet) in three partitions {{were randomly selected from}} the plantation and felled for the study. Wood samples were prepared from five height levels, 10 %, 30 %, 50 %, 70 % and 90 % and also among the wood type; inner wood, middle wood and outer wood positions of the stem according to standard procedures. The result showed the wood is dense, dimensionally stable with an average density of 0. 55 g/cm 3. Among three partitions, ring width variation had a marked effect on wood density and <b>anisotropic</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of the wood (p < 0. 05). A strong positive correlation was established between density and shrinkage properties. The relationship between ring width and <b>anisotropic</b> <b>shrinkage</b> was positive.

Dilatometry experiments along 3 directions reveal <b>anisotropic</b> <b>shrinkages,</b> {{which are in}} correlation with different activation energy for sintering. Mullite growth is strongly anisotropic, inducing {{the formation of an}} organized microstructure, where larger mullite crystals are mainly oriented in plane of layer and perpendicular to alumina fibers. Kinetic data from thermal transformations show that the starting reaction mechanism is mullite nucleation, and it is continued by a strongly anisotropic grain growth. It is explained by topotactic transformations at phyllosilicate faces and along alumina arrangements. Mullite growth kinetics is also favored perpendicularly to fiber main dimension by the anisotropy of alumina diffusion coefficient. It shows the limited importance of mullite crystallization in microstructural transformation, but it also shows that controlled mullite growth is central in microstructural arrangement...|$|R

The use of specialty thermoplastics such as polyetherimide (PEI), polyphenylenesulfide (PPS) and polyether-etherketone (PEEK) reinforced with glass, carbon or aramid fibres results in solvent and corrosion resistant products with high specific stiffness and high melting temperature. These composites can be moulded into complicated shapes with the rubber pressing process where a relatively hot laminate is shortly pressed between a cold rubber mould {{and a cold}} steel tool. The process is fast compared to the forming of thermosetting polymer matrix composites where extensive curing times are involved.

The representative cell model shapes before and after shrinkage constructed by the analysis revealed that the early wood tracheid showed <b>anisotropic</b> <b>shrinkage,</b> although the late wood tracheid showed almost isotropic shrinkage. To link the macroscopic shrinkage of coniferous wood with the results obtained by the power spectrum analysis, a two-layer model composed of early wood and late wood was adopted, and the relation between shrinkage anisotropy and late wood fraction was predicted. The results suggested that the shrinkage anisotropy depended significantly on the mechanical interaction between early and late wood.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Diffusion {{processes}} {{driven by}} anisotropic diffusion tensors {{are known to}} be well-suited for structure-preserving denoising. However, numerical implementations based on finite differences introduce unwanted blurring artifacts that deteriorate these favourable filtering properties. In this paper we introduce a novel discretisation of a fairly general class of anisotropic diffusion processes on a 2 -D grid. It leads to a locally semi-analytic scheme (LSAS) that is absolutely stable, simple to implement and offers an outstanding sharpness of filtered images. By showing that this scheme can be translated into a 2 -D Haar wavelet shrinkage procedure, we establish a connection between tensor-driven diffusion and <b>anisotropic</b> wavelet <b>shrinkage</b> for the first time. This result leads to coupled shrinkage rules that allow to perform highly anisotropic filtering even with the simplest wavelets. ...|$|R

40|$|Wood xylem fiber cell {{consists}} of two main parts: a thick secondary wall and thin compound middle lamella (CML). A middle layer (S 2) is the thickest layer of the secondary wall and is reinforced with fibrous polysaccharide crystals oriented more or less parallel to the fiber cell axis. The orientation angle (microfibril angle; MFA) determines the mechanical properties of the wood xylem fibers, including the longitudinal Young’s modulus, <b>anisotropic</b> drying <b>shrinkage,</b> surface growth stress, longitudinal tensile creep deformation, and so forth. Consequently, the S 2 layer takes {{an important role in}} determining the macroscopic properties of clear wood specimens, with the mechanical interaction between the reinforcing polysaccharides and the encrusting matrix substance ultimately controlling the material properties of the wood. Any formulation of the material properties of a wood based on its structural hierarchy starts by considering the mechanical properties of the two-phase structure of the cell wall layer; that is, the reinforcing fibrous polysaccharide and the amorphous matrix (Fig. 1).

Improved understanding of the mechanisms of flake drying has been provided. Observations of flake drying and drying rate curves revealed that rate of moisture loss consisted of two falling rate periods and no constant rate drying period was observed. Convective heat transfer controls the first period, and bound water diffusion controls the second period. Influence of lower drying temperatures on bending properties of wood flakes was investigated. Drying temperature {{was found to have}} a significant influence on bending stiffness and strength. A worksheet for calculation of the energy required to dry a single strandboard flake was developed but has not been tested in an industrial setting yet. A more complete understanding of <b>anisotropic</b> transverse <b>shrinkage</b> of wood is proposed based on test results and statistical analysis. A simplified mod el of a wood cell's cross-section was drawn for calculating differential transverse shrinkage. The model utilizes cell wall thickness and microfibrillar packing density and orientation. In spite of some phenomena of cell wall structure not yet understood completely, the results might explain <b>anisotropic</b> transverse <b>shrinkage</b> to a major extent. Boundary layer theory was found useful for evaluating external moisture resistance during drying. Simulated moisture gradients were quire comparable to the actual gradients in dried wood. A mathematical procedure for determining diffusion and surface emission coefficients was also developed. Thermal conductivity models of wood derived from its anatomical structure were created and tested against experimental values. Model estimations provide insights into changes in heat transfer parameters during drying. Two new techniques for measuring moisture gradients created in wood during drying were developed. A new technique that utilizes optical properties of cobalt chloride was developed for nondestructive determination of surface moisture content. Fundamental new understanding of drying characteristics in wood and fiber has been provided that can be used by researchers to improve drying of wood and fiber. The three techniques for measuring moisture content and gradients provided in this study are efficient, practical, and economical - easy to apply by industry and researchers.

The medium-sized poly-EGs at 30 % weight/ weight concentration absorbed almost all the evaporable water from the fibre. Passive tension measurement at near slack sarcomere spacing indicated that this dehydration by EGs did not accompany longitudinal fibre shrinkage. Chemically relevant fully hydric alcohols (glycerol, threitol, ribitol and mannitol; Mr 92 – 182) showed no appreciable dehydrating ability on fibres. An intimate correlation was found between fibre dehydration and CH 2 -concentration of the solutions. Viscosity measurements indicated that the hydrodynamic radii of the alcohols were compa-rable {{to those of the}} small EGs. Therefore, hydrodynamic radii are not a primary determinant of the dehydrating ability. Additionally, CH 2 -concentration of EGs but not alcohols was found to correlate intimately with the measured viscosity of the bulk solution of EGs.

40|$|In this thesis, {{a new set}} of {{finite element}} {{formulations}} are developed for computer simulation of microstructural evolution which is controlled by solid-state diffusion and grain-boundary migration. The finite element formulations are based on the classical cubic spline interpolation and form a natural extension of the linear finite element scheme which was first developed by Pan, Cocks and Kucherenko (1997). The cubic spline elements are however much more efficient numerically than the previous linear elements and make it possible to undertake large scale computer simulations of microstructural evolution using ordinary personal computers. The newly developed finite element scheme is then used to study the sintering process of powder compacts. Two important issues are addressed in this thesis. First, the sintering kinetics of large pores is investigated in details. An established theory due to Kingery (1967) predicts that a pore will shrink only if its coordination number (number of grains surrounding the pore) is less than a critical value which depends on the dihedral angle of the powder material. However, there are increasing experimental evidences contradicting this theory. Very large pores were observed to shrink continuously in the sintering process. The numerical study presented in this thesis demonstrated that the critical coordination number theory is in fact not a general rule. The computer simulations show that a very large pore does shrink unless it is surrounded by identical grains, which is obviously not true in any real powder compact. Secondly, the finite element scheme is used to study the <b>anisotropic</b> <b>shrinkage</b> during the sintering process. The numerical study reveals the key factors which control <b>anisotropic</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and shows that models based on continuum mechanics are unable to capture the critical influence of these key factors...|$|E

40|$|International audienceStress states {{caused in}} wood by drying periods {{are often the}} source of {{considerable}} structural disorders, when this material is used as structural material. The origin of these stresses is generally due to the viscoelastic behaviour of the wood combined with the dimensional variations (shrinkage) related to the moisture content. In order to better understand this phenomenon, a slice of green wood is submitted to natural drying in stable environmental conditions. The wood slice is placed on an electronic balance so as so to measure the moisture content variation during the drying period. Simultaneously, the displacements caused in the slice by the drying are captured by a video camera. An incremental relaxation model based on the generalized Maxwell's chain is {{used to analyze the}} evolution of the stresses induced by the drying process within the wood slice. Numerical results show the development of tensile stresses in the material. Analyzing these results leads {{to the conclusion that the}} stresses are due to the orthotropic behaviour of the wood material combined with <b>anisotropic</b> drying <b>shrinkage.</b> A tensile stress concentration is evidenced in a zone where a crack was finally observed during the test. Keywords Green wood • Relaxation stresses • Drying process • Finite element method 5. 1 Introduction The natural or the artificial drying of wood is commonly responsible for large strain and can lead to the cracking and the final collapse of the timbers structures. These defects are much more marked on the wood pieces cut and stored outdoors the long periods ago [1]. The timber is composed of polymers sensitive to the temperature and the humidity, therefore, its drying involves dimensional changes due to the shrinkage. Hence, the behaviour of wood during drying depends strongly in the one part, of the geometry, the moisture content gradient, the temperature, the sorption of wood history, but also, of the heterogeneous character, the orthotropic behaviour, and the viscoelastic effects of this material. It appears that, the phenomenon of shrinkage and the mechanical behaviour of wood during drying play an important role in the development of wood defects. In this context, it is essential to understand the contribution of different processes in the strain of the green wood during the drying phase. In the literature, various studies concerning the strain and the stress evolutions caused by drying of wood have been conducted. These works are generally based on complex analytical approaches solved by finite element models taking into account the changes of the mechanical properties of wood during the drying phase [2, 3]. In addition, several authors have presented drying models that can assess the distribution of moisture inside the wood during the shrinkage with moisture content near the fiber saturation point (FSP) [4]. Also, the mechanical behaviour of wood and tree has been proposed in order to know the impact of the biomechanical and the microstructures parameters in the old history [5]. Recently, the studies on the rheological behaviour of wood during growth phases have shown the effect of the viscoelastic effects in the recovery of the tree during its growth [6] without insist on the contribution of moisture content in the manifestation of this complex phenomenon...|$|R

The generation of new hybrids and clones is a reality in the national practice of silviculture, and there is great interest currently in finding genetic improvements, mainly for higher volumetric gains and resistance in rough conditions of planting, such as pest attacks, periods of drought, low soil fertility, etc. The basic density {{is one of the most}} important physical properties of wood because it relates directly to other properties, including the <b>anisotropic</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> Such properties indicate the rational use of a species in a certain wood product. The aim of this work was to determine the basic density and the <b>anisotropic</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of five wood clones for each one of the following species: Eucalyptus saligna, Eucalyptus grandis and Eucalyptus dunnii. Clone 5 of Eucalyptus saligna presented the highest basic density (0. 56 g/cm³) and was the most dimensionally instable. Of all the species, there was only a direct relation among basic density, maximum volumetric shrinkage and maximum volumetric shrinkage coefficient in this clone.

40|$|All {{ceramics}} and powder metals, including the ceramics components that Sandia uses in critical weapons components such as PZT voltage bars and current stacks, multi-layer ceramic MET's, ahmindmolybdenum & alumina cermets, and ZnO varistors, are manufactured by sintering. Sintering is a critical, {{possibly the most}} important, processing step during manufacturing of ceramics. The microstructural evolution, the macroscopic shrinkage, and shape distortions during sintering will control the engineering performance of the resulting ceramic component. Yet, modeling and prediction of sintering behavior is in its infancy, lagging far behind the other manufacturing models, such as powder synthesis and powder compaction models, and behind models that predict engineering properties and reliability. In this project, we developed a model that was capable of simulating microstructural evolution during sintering, providing constitutive equations for macroscale simulation of shrinkage and distortion during sintering. And we developed macroscale sintering simulation capability in JAS 3 D. The mesoscale model can simulate microstructural evolution in a complex powder compact of hundreds or even thousands of particles of arbitrary shape and size by 1. curvature-driven grain growth, 2. pore migration and coalescence by surface diffusion, 3. vacancy formation, grain boundary diffusion and annihilation. This model was validated by comparing predictions of the simulation to analytical predictions for simple geometries. The model was then used to simulate sintering in complex powder compacts. Sintering stress and materials viscous module {{were obtained from the}} simulations. These constitutive equations were then used by macroscopic simulations for simulating shrinkage and shape changes in FEM simulations. The continuum theory of sintering embodied in the constitutive description of Skorohod and Olevsky was combined with results from microstructure evolution simulations to model shrinkage and deformation during. The continuum portion is based on a finite element formulation that allows 3 D components to be modeled using SNL's nonlinear large-deformation finite element code, JAS 3 D. This tool provides a capability to model sintering of complex three-dimensional components. The model was verified by comparing to simulations results published in the literature. The model was validated using experimental results from various laboratory experiments performed by Garino. In addition, the mesoscale simulations were used to study <b>anisotropic</b> <b>shrinkage</b> in aligned, elongated powder compacts. <b>Anisotropic</b> <b>shrinkage</b> occurred in all compacts with aligned, elongated particles. However, the direction of higher shrinkage was in some cases along the direction of elongation and in other cases in the perpendicular direction depending on the details of the powder compact. In compacts of simple-packed, mono-sized, elongated particles, shrinkage was higher in the direction of elongation. In compacts of close-packed, mono-sized, elongated particles and of elongated particles with a size and shape distribution, the shrinkage was lower in the direction of elongation. We also explored the concept of a sintering stress tensor rather than the traditional sintering stress scalar concept for the case of <b>anisotropic</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> A thermodynamic treatment of this is presented. A method to calculate the sintering stress tensor is also presented. A user-friendly code that can simulate microstructural evolution during sintering in 2 D and in 3 D was developed. This code can run on most UNIX platforms and has a motif-based GUI. The microstructural evolution is shown as the code is running and many of the microstructural features, such as grain size, pore size, the average grain boundary length (in 2 D) and area (in 3 D), etc. are measured and recorded as a function of time. The overall density as the function of time is also recorded...|$|E
40|$|<b>Anisotropic</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of 27 -year old Pinus radiata {{wood was}} {{measured}} from green to oven-dry condition. The samples were prepared from 21 discs cut from seven trees at different stem heights of 0. 1 m, 5. 2 m and 10. 3 m above ground, respectively. Longitudinal shrinkage {{was found to}} vary from 0. 02 % to 2. 34 %, with peak values near the pith decreasing towards the bark. The variation was more pronounced at the 0. 1 m height. The longitudinal shrinkage also showed a trend of decrease with the stem height above the ground. Tangential and radial shrinkage was found to increase with growth ring number from the pith, but the variation along the stem height did not show a clear trend. The results confi rmed that the pith-to-bark variation and vertical variation of the anisotropic shrinka-ge were signifi cant for radiata pine. Large differences were also observed among corewood, transition wood and outerwood. Microfi bril angle (MFA) was believed to {{the main reason for}} these variations...|$|E
40|$|Dimensional {{control is}} one of the basic {{problems}} in ceramic processing, especially for tape cast ceramic sheets which are used to build up multilayer structures for high-integrated components. Uncontrolled <b>anisotropic</b> <b>shrinkage</b> can cause geometrical distortion and circuit failure of multilayer ceramics during sintering. The understanding of the relationship between green tape microstructure and shrinkage anisotropy is of great importance for further miniaturization of multilayer devices. In this study, alumina powders with spherical particle shape were used to cast green tapes. The microstructure as well as the pore orientation and the shrinkage behavior were analyzed. According to the sintering theory, grain growth and pore elimination are the two most important mechanisms to describe sintering shrinkage. In this work, three-dimensional shrinkage behavior of tape cast alumina powders with spherical particle shape was investigated and correlated with pore orientation in the microstructure. Specifically, the reason for the different shrinkage in z-direction compared to the lateral shrinkage is in focus. The study is based on experiments as well as on mathematical visualization...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{migration}} of secondary particles in a non-Newtonian ceramic slurry in the tape casting process is investigated {{with the purpose of}} understanding the particle distribution patterns along the casting direction. The Ostwald-de Waele power law model for the non-Newtonian flow behaviour is assumed in the simulation of the ceramic slurry flow. A local variation of the viscosity (LVOV) model {{as a function of the}} particle volume fraction is introduced and taken into account in the advection and the settling of the particles in the flow field. The results show that using the LVOV model changes the particle distribution pattern from being a constant distribution to a semi-layered one. The presence of such layered structure is highly affecting the subsequent sintering process, which in turn causes <b>anisotropic</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of the dried tapes. Moreover, it is found that increasing the substrate velocity (casting speed) leads to a more uniform distribution of the particles inside the ceramic slurry, in which case the shear induced particle migration is dominating over the gravity induced one...|$|E
40|$|This study {{assessed}} of {{the effects}} of within tree variation on wood density, ring width and volumetric shrinkage of Pinus caribeae (Morlet) among four different plantation ages in Oluwa forest reserve. Five Pinus caribaea (Morlet) in three partitions were randomly selected from each of the four different ages (15, 16, 17 and 18) of the plantation and felled for the study. Wood samples were prepared from five height levels, 10 %, 30 %, 50 %, 70 % and 90 % and also among the wood type; inner wood, middle wood and outer wood positions of the stem according to standard procedures. The result showed that the wood density ranged between 0. 33 g/cm 3 and 0. 56 g/cm 3. Among the plantation ages, a strong positive correlation was established between density, ring width and shrinkage properties including the relationship between ring width and volumetric shrinkage being positive. Thus, {{it may be possible to}} use density and grain orientation biometry to predict <b>anisotropic</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of the wood and its dimensional stability...|$|E
