40|$|Glucocorticoids (corticosterone {{in birds}} and rodents and {{cortisol}} {{in all other}} mammals) are glucoregulatory hormones that are synthesized {{in response to a}} range of stimuli including stress and are regularly measured in the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> animal <b>welfare.</b> Glucocorticoids have many normal or nonstress- related functions, and glucocorticoid synthesis can increase in response to pleasure, excitement, and arousal as well as fear, anxiety, and pain. Often, when assessing animal welfare, little consideration is given to normal non-stress-related glucocorticoid functions or the complex mechanisms that regulate the effects of glucocorticoids on physiology. In addition, it is rarely acknowledged that increased glucocorticoid synthesis can indicate positive welfare states or that a stress response can increase fitness and improve the <b>welfare</b> <b>of</b> an animal. In this paper, we review how and when glucocorticoid synthesis increases, the actions mediated through type I and type II glucocorticoid receptors, the importance of corticosteroid-binding globulin, the role of 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and the key aspects of neurophysiology relevant to activating the hypothalamo–pituitary–adrenal axis. This is discussed in the context <b>of</b> animal <b>welfare</b> <b>assessment,</b> particularly under the biological functioning and affective states frameworks. We contend that extending the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> animal <b>welfare</b> to key brain regions afferent to the hypothalamus and incorporating the aspects of glucocorticoid physiology that affect change in target tissue will advance animal welfare science and inspire more comprehensive <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>welfare</b> <b>of</b> animals...|$|R

We examined the effects of whether or not a veterinarian was included in the inspection team, type of inspection, licence status of the zoo and membership of a zoo association on the inspectors’ <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> animal <b>welfare</b> standards in five areas that approximate to the Five Freedoms. At least 11 % of full licence inspections did not comply with the legal requirement for two inspectors.

Of 9, 024 animal welfare assessments across the 192 zoos, 7, 511 (83 %) were graded as meeting the standards, 782 (9 %) as substandard and the rest were not graded.

40|$|Several {{systems have}} been {{proposed}} for the overall <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> animal <b>welfare</b> at the farm level {{for the purpose of}} advising farmers or assisting public decision-making. They are generally based on several measures compounded into a single evaluation, using different rules to assemble the information.

Data obtained on a farm can be (i) analysed by an expert who draws an overall conclusion; (ii) compared with minimal requirements set for each measure; (iii) converted into ranks, which are then summed; or (iv) converted into values or scores compounded in a weighted sum (e. g. TGI 35 L) or using ad hoc rules.

40|$|Introduction: During {{the last}} years, concern has {{increased}} concerning animal welfare {{at the farm}} level. The Associations of Organic Agriculture have elaborated minimum requirements regarding animal welfare.

Conclusions: Concerning sample used (straw based loose housing systems), organic farms on average showed a better welfare status than conventional farms. This has also been demonstrated in other studies (for a review see Hörning, 1998). Mean points achieved in single criteria show deficiencies and therefore potential for improvements. The respective scoring systems seem to be suitable for an on-farm assessment of housing conditions and thus to de-monstrate the preconditions for animal welfare as an indirect measure.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Wiley via the DOI in this record. Rising immigration rates in Western Europe concur with increasing anti-immigrant attitudes. While <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> <b>welfare</b> eligibility in the United States demonstrably hinge on how public servants perceive different racial groups as deserving, we know less about ethnically motivated discrimination in the European context. This paper argues that Switzerland is a critical case for studying such developments. It combines social construction theory and the deservingness heuristic to analyze how social constructions of Swiss natives and immigrants influence 90 disability benefits insurance procedures. Findings reveal that immigrants are perceived as less deserving and less powerful than Swiss applicants. Thus, Swiss welfare workers do not allocate <b>welfare</b> benefits independently <b>of</b> an applicant's nationality. Our results raise fundamental questions about the equal treatment <b>of</b> <b>welfare</b> applicants in times of rising immigration and anti-immigrant attitudes. The feed-forward effects of social constructions imply longer-term consequences for good administrative practices and society that require scholarly attention...|$|R

40|$|After doing a CE {{literature}} review {{to examine the}} dominant trends around the definition of environmental attributes {{in terms of their}} identification as external benefits or costs, their description through qualitative or quantitative attribute level labels, their number of levels and their assumed relationship with utility (i. e. linear vs non-linear), three main conclusions have been drawn. First, definition of environmental attributes as external costs has been uncommon. Second, only one single parameter has been estimated for most of them, in which cases the number of quantitative and qualitative attributes has been similar. Third, nonlinear effects have been mainly depicted through use of qualitative attributes.
