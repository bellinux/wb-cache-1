5|$|An {{important}} aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> games, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with stage magic. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained {{over a number of}} consecutive days.|$|E
5|$|Snake scales {{occur in}} variety of shapes. They may be cycloid as in family Typhlopidae, long and pointed with pointed tips, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> the Green Vine Snake Ahaetulla nasuta, broad and leaf-like, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> green pit vipers Trimeresurus spp or as broad {{as they are}} long, for example, as in Rat snake Ptyas mucosus.|$|E
5|$|As in an oratorio, {{the written}} text in a choral symphony {{can be as}} {{important}} as the music, and the chorus and soloists can participate equally with the instruments in the exposition and development of musical ideas. The text can also help determine whether the composer follows symphonic form strictly, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> Rachmaninoff, Britten and Shostakovich, or whether they expand symphonic form, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> Berlioz, Mahler and Havergal Brian. Sometimes the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures, as with Szymanowski, Schnittke and, again, Havergal Brian. The composer can also choose to treat the text fluidly, in a manner more like music than narrative. Such was the case with Vaughan Williams, Mahler and Philip Glass.|$|E

5|$|Antibodies {{to certain}} types of {{chromatin}} organization, in particular, nucleosomes, {{have been associated with}} a number of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. These are known as anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and have also been observed in concert with multiple sclerosis as part of general immune system dysfunction. <b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> progeria, the role played by the antibodies in inducing the symptoms of autoimmune diseases is not obvious.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> its {{predecessor}} Landsat 1, the satellite's payload included two remote sensing instruments, the Return Beam Vidicon (RBV) and the Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS).

The data acquired by the MSS was considered more scientifically useful than the data returned from the RBV, which was rarely used and considered only for engineering evaluation purposes.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> kelpies {{and water}} horses, most myths about water bulls are about males of the species. Occasionally a water cow is mentioned, {{as in the}} Highland tale set at Borrodale on Skye, where a water cow was reputed to reside in a small loch. Canine {{carcases}} left out to trap the beast were ignored. Sir Walter Scott also refers to a water cow in a story about an attempt to drain Loch na Beiste to kill one believed to be living there.|$|E

5|$|Crop {{diversity}} loss threatens global food security, as the world's {{human population}} {{depends on a}} diminishing number of varieties of a diminishing number of crop species. Crops are increasingly grown in monoculture, meaning that if, as in the historic Irish Potato Famine, a single disease overcomes a variety's resistance, it may destroy an entire harvest, or <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> the 'Gros Michel' banana, may cause the commercial extinction of an entire variety. With the help of seed banks, international organizations are working to preserve crop diversity.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the aim of}} the NCMP {{scheme to}} {{ameliorate}} the impacts of the first-past-the-post system, its legitimacy is highly doubted. It is based neither on a clear electoral mandate like ordinary MPs, nor on expertise or specialization (<b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> NMPs). As a result, the privileges of NCMPs are severely curtailed and this limits their effectiveness as alternative voices in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} few weeks of 2010, there was renewed anxiety about {{excessive}} national debt, with lenders demanding ever-higher interest rates from several countries with higher debt levels, deficits, and current account deficits. This in turn made it difficult for four out of eighteen Eurozone governments to finance further budget deficits and repay or refinance existing government debt, particularly when economic growth rates were low, and when a high percentage of debt was in the hands of foreign creditors, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> Greece and Portugal.|$|E

5|$|In {{the tales}} of heroic Greece, royal {{succession}} often passed from father-in-law to son-in-law, and some historians have seen in this an early example of the epikleros pattern. Some examples include Pelops, Bellerophon, Melampus, Peleus, Telamon, and Diomedes. Not all such heroic era royal successions followed the epikleros pattern however, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> Menelaus, who married Helen of Troy and succeeded Helen's father Tyndareus, even though Tyndareus had living sons, Kastor and Polydeukes. Another example is Arete of Phaeacia in the Odyssey, who was an heiress married to her father's brother Alcinous.|$|E
5|$|Lepidoptera {{have two}} large, {{immovable}} compound eyes which {{consist of a}} large number of facets or lenses, each connected to a lens-like cylinder which is attached to a nerve leading to the brain. Each eye may have up to 17,000 individual light receptors (ommatidia) which in combination provide a broad mosaic view of the surrounding area. One tropical Asian family, the Amphitheridae, has compound eyes divided into two distinct segments. The eyes are usually smooth but may be covered by minute hairs. The eyes of butterflies are usually brown, golden-brown or even red <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> some species of skippers.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes snakes have {{enlarged}} scales, either {{single or}} paired, under the tail; these are called subcaudals or urosteges. These subcaudals may be smooth or keeled as in Bitis arietans somalica. The {{end of the}} tail may simply taper into a tip (<b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> most snakes), it may form a spine (as in Acanthophis), end in a bony spur (as in Lachesis), a rattle (as in Crotalus), or a rudder as seen in many sea snakes.|$|E
