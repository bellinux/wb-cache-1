In particular, the response of anaerobic organisms to Mars-like stress factors and combinations thereof are not known. In the EC project MASE (Mars Analogues for Space Exploration) we address these limitations by characterising different Mars <b>analogue</b> <b>environments</b> on Earth, isolating microorganisms from these sites and exposing them to Mars relevant stress factors alone and in combination.

On the other hand, there is no standardized and unified technology which would provide for a uniform qualification and comprehensive treatment of these issues. Moreover, the place of commission of these criminal offences as a rule does not coincide with the place of occurring legal consequences.

The distinction between “born digital” and digitized objects is explored.

On Mars, the relatively recent identification of minerals which indicate the presence of neutral/alkaline aqueous activity has increased the number of potentially habitable environments which require characterisation and exploration. The study of terrestrial <b>analogue</b> <b>environments</b> enables us to develop a better understanding of where life can exist, what types of organisms can exist and what evidence of that life may be preserved. The study of <b>analogue</b> <b>environments</b> is necessary not only in relation to the possibility of identifying extinct/extant indigenous life on Mars, but also for understanding the potential for contamination. As well as gaining an insight into the habitability of an environment, it is also essential to understand how to identify such environments using the instruments available to missions to Mars. It is important to be aware of instrument limitations to ensure that evidence of a particular environment is not overlooked. This work focuses upon studying the bacterial and archaeal diversity of Lake Magadi, a hypersaline and alkaline soda lake, and its associated hydrothermal springs. Culture dependent and culture independent analytical methods have been used and have led to the identification of potentially novel isolates. In addition, the effects of simulated Martian conditions such as desiccation and UVC radiation upon single strains isolated from this environment, and the effects upon a complex soil community have been assessed.

In contrast, the various Antarctic research outposts such as Concordia and McMurdo serve as valuable platforms for studying biobehavioral adaptations to ICE environments, but are still Earth-bound, and thus lack the low-gravity and radiation risks of space. The International Space Station (ISS), itself now considered an <b>analogue</b> <b>environment</b> for long-duration missions, better approximates the habitable infrastructure limitations of a lunar colony than most Antarctic settlements in an altered gravity setting.

The advantages offered by the digital technologies are major but the same digital technology {{opens the door for}} unlimited piracy. Copying an analogue VCR tape was certainly possible and relatively easy, in spite of various forms of protection, but due to the <b>analogue</b> <b>environment,</b> the subsequent copies had an inherent loss in quality. This was a natural way of limiting the multiple copying of a video material. With digital technology, this barrier disappears, being possible to make as many copies as desired, without any loss in quality whatsoever. Digital watermarking {{is one of the best}} available tools for fighting this threat. The aim of the present work was to develop a digital watermarking system compliant with the recommendations drawn by the EBU, for video broadcast monitoring. Since the watermark can be inserted in either spatial domain or transform domain, this aspect was investigated and led to the conclusion that wavelet transform is one of the best solutions available. Since watermarking is not an easy task, especially considering the robustness under various attacks several techniques were employed in order to increase the capacity/robustness of the system: spread-spectrum and modulation techniques to cast the watermark, powerful error correction to protect the mark, human visual models to insert a robust mark and to ensure its invisibility. The combination of these methods led to a major improvement, but yet the system wasn't robust to several important geometrical attacks. In order to achieve this last milestone, the system uses two distinct watermarks: a spatial domain reference watermark and the main watermark embedded in the wavelet domain. By using this reference watermark and techniques specific to image registration, the system is able to determine the parameters of the attack and revert it. Once the attack was reverted, the main watermark is recovered. The final result is a high capacity, blind DWr-based video watermarking system, robust to a wide range of attacks.

40|$|The {{present day}} martian surface is cold, dry, exposed to UV {{radiation}} and bombarded with heavy ions [1]. Any remaining {{water in the}} near subsurface {{is likely to have}} a high salt concentration because of the likely evaporative processes occurring in those environments. Halophiles are UV resistant [3] and have an ability to entomb themselves within salt crystals during periods of desiccation [4], halophiles have therefore been proposed as analogues for potential martian life. Boulby Salt and Potash Mine in Yorkshire has excavations up to 1. 4 km underground and is the second deepest mine in Europe. Despite this depth and the darkness, Norton et al., [5] isolated halophiles from the halite deposits. In this project, we will attempt to isolate and characterize halophiles from halite and other salt-rich sediments from Boulby Mine such as potash, sylvinite, anhydrite and polyhalite, in order to gain an understanding of potential life in the subsurface of Mars. Although the Boulby Mine is used as a martian <b>analogue</b> <b>environment</b> [6], it does possess certain key differences from modern Mars, in particular its aerobic environment and warm temperature. Our long-term goals, once we have characterized the micro-organisms present, are to expose them to Mars conditions (past and present) to determine their ability to grow in such environments. Elements of the martian environment being considered include variations in temperature, lack of oxygen and variations in brine composition., We will then focus on defining molecular biomarkers and geochemical bio-signatures that may be used as evidence of past or present life on Mars.

The MASE (Mars analogues for space exploration) consortium is a team of researchers from all over Europe, combining a broad spectrum of interdisciplinary expertise. Five major sampling sites (dedicated campaigns: cold sulfur springs in Germany, potash mine in England, cold acidic lake in Iceland; samples already available: Rio Tinto in Spain, permafrost samples from Svaldbard) were chosen with the major goal to cultivate and characterize novel anaerobic microorganisms which are specifically adapted to harsh conditions. Samples from these different Mars analogue areas on Earth were collected and anaerobic microorganisms adapted to these extreme conditions are being isolated. These new strains will be subjected to mars-relevant environmental stress factors alone and in combination in the laboratory under controlled conditions, e. g. radiation, high salt concentrations, low water activity, oxidising compounds.
