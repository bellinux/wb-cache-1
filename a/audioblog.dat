2500|$|Blogging {{has brought}} about new ways of writing diaries and from a {{linguistic}} perspective, the language used in blogs is [...] "in its most 'naked' form", published {{for the world to}} see without undergoing the formal editing process. This is what makes blogs stand out because almost all other forms of printed language have gone through some form of editing and standardization. David Crystal stated that blogs were [...] "the beginning of a new stage {{in the evolution of the}} written language". Blogs have become so popular that they have expanded beyond written blogs, with the emergence of photoblog, videoblog, <b>audioblog</b> and moblog. These developments in interactive blogging have created new linguistic conventions and styles, with more expected to arise in the future.|$|E

40|$|Podcasting is {{an audio}} content {{syndication}} through RSS feeds in the <b>audioblogs.</b> As a new application of <b>audioblogging,</b> podcasting uses the enclosures in RSS feeds for syndication {{and distribution of}} audio content to mobile music players on the Web. Despite the advantages of podcasting, {{there is a need}} for research that focus on the use of podcasts as learning objects. Incorporating podcasts into e-learning systems require some design and translation work to achieve the pedagogical needs. This paper presents an introductory investigation on approaches to tailor and use audio podcasts as learning objects in learning management systems and learning object repositories...|$|R
5000|$|On the first, paid day of Bloggercon I, four panels {{discussed}} {{the interaction of}} blogging with journalism, education, marketing, and presidential politics. The second day's panels included various technical and infrastructure issues such as RSS, news aggregators, and what was then called [...] "audioblogging". The first BloggerCon brought together <b>audioblogging</b> pioneers with developers, whose collective efforts led to the phenomenon that spread six months later under the name podcasting.|$|R
5000|$|October 2003, Winer {{and friends}} {{organized}} the first Bloggercon weblogger conference at Berkman Center. CDs of Lydon's interviews were distributed {{as an example}} of the high-quality MP3 content enclosures could deliver; [...] Bob Doyle demonstrated the portable studio he helped Lydon develop; Harold Gilchrist presented a history of <b>audioblogging,</b> including Curry's early role, and Kevin Marks demonstrated a script to download RSS enclosures and pass them to iTunes for transfer to an iPod. Curry and Marks discussed collaborating.|$|R

Subsequently, Williams bought out Charles River's {{interest in the}} company, {{as well as that}} of several other investors, and re‑formed the organization under a new company, Obvious Corp, which planned to develop new products, including Twitter.|$|E

2500|$|Winer {{has been}} given [...] "credit for the {{invention}} of the podcasting model." [...] Having received user requests for <b>audioblogging</b> features since October 2000, especially from Adam Curry, Winer decided to include new functionality in RSS 0.92 by defining a new element called [...] "enclosure," [...] which would pass the address of a media file to the RSS aggregator. He demonstrated the RSS enclosure feature on January 11, 2001 by enclosing a Grateful Dead song in his Scripting News weblog.|$|R
50|$|Its premise was {{centered}} on a preteen girl named Natalie who managed a live web diary while her family traveled across the United States while {{in the backseat of}} the family van. The character Natalie's web site, which later became Nick.com, would also contain games, photos, audio, and video clips along with written words about the character's thoughts and musings. The website and television shorts launched simultaneously in 1996, as both correlated with the other. The show was created before weblogs, <b>audioblogs,</b> photo blogs, and vlogs rose in popularity in the 2000s.|$|R
50|$|An MP3 blog {{is a type}} of blog {{in which}} the creator makes music files, {{normally}} in the MP3 format, available for download. They are also known as musicblogs, <b>audioblogs</b> or soundblogs (the latter two can also mean podcasts). MP3 blogs have become increasingly popular since 2003. The music posted ranges from hard-to-find rarities that have not been issued in many years to more contemporary offerings, and selections are often restricted to a particular musical genre or theme. Some musicblogs offer music in Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) or Ogg formats.|$|R

2500|$|Winer's weblogging product, Radio Userland, {{the program}} favored by Curry, had a {{built-in}} aggregator and thus provided both the [...] "send" [...] and [...] "receive" [...] components {{of what was}} then called <b>audioblogging.</b> In July 2003 Winer challenged other aggregator developers to provide support for enclosures. In October 2003, Kevin Marks demonstrated a script to download RSS enclosures and pass them to iTunes for transfer to an iPod. Curry then offered an RSS-to-iPod script that moved MP3 files from Radio UserLand to iTunes. The term [...] "podcasting" [...] was suggested by Ben Hammersley in February 2004.|$|R
50|$|Tech-savvy bloggers can use {{multimedia}} {{to create}} <b>audioblogs</b> and videoblogs that present experiences, opinions, dialogs, stories, and teachings, {{creating a more}} live feel to the blogging experience. Many prominent thinkers, authors, and leaders have blogs that present a podcast or streaming audio of speeches, lectures, or sermons. Video sharing sites like YouTube and Google Video allow anyone with a web camera to post video alongside professional religious movie producers and make it available to millions of users. This allows believers to share ideas about faith in new and creative ways. Most of these sites allow people to embed video hosted remotely onto their blog or website, powering video-based communication across the Internet. Christian-specific sites have also recently sprung up to provide faith-based video sharing services.|$|R

Two more new tracks from Uffie, [...] "Hot Chick" [...] and [...] "In Charge", leaked to blogs before being released as a double A-side in November 2006. The EP Suited and Looted {{was released in}} June 2007 by Ed Banger Records, containing the single [...] "F1rst Love" [...] and [...] "Brand New Car". Canadian electronic duo Crystal Castles featured vocals sampled from Uffie on the track [...] "Make It Hott", although it was never officially released, {{it can be found}} through various <b>audioblogs.</b> Also in 2007, Uffie collaborated with labelmates Justice on the song [...] "TThhEe PPaARRtTYY", from their debut album †.|$|R

[...] "Ungawa" [...] proved to be a popular song online, where the track appeared on numerous <b>audioblogs</b> including Fluxblog and Vs. Bear, and in the LA club scene, where it was spun by Peaches and JD Samson of Le Tigre. The press response to Chow Nasty quickly blossomed, and the SF Weekly described the group as [...] "Sweet jams and beats that go boom, it's 21st century soul music as played by three kids with A.D.D. and a cursory knowledge of Radio Shack electronics," [...] and the SF Bay Guardian commenting that their [...] "Infectiously goofy, balls-out shows come off like some kind of underage, oversexed punk b-boy Rolling Stones revival." ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{submission}} is to show {{the results of the}} study carried out with 199 students of journalism degree from the University of Valladolid. This experience evaluates to what extend blogs promote individual and group competences and skills, with the goal to determine the advantages and disadvantages of collaborative learning in the virtual environment of the blo-gosphere. New hybrid weblogs, <b>audioblogs</b> and tvblogs, have been used for practical on the subjects of News on Radio and News on Television for two consecutive courses. The experience has shown great usefulness not only in building the horizontal knowledge about the journalistic work from the classroom, the labs, and in their individual work outside the university environment, but it has also contributed positively to their community integration, enhancing negotiated decision-making and respect for the work of the others. These multimedia logs have enabled students to participate in the creation of content, in the production process, corporate design, bringing out and social media distribution, while learning to organize every element in harmonious and consistent way in order to create an independent audiovisual product related to other webs that can be used as documentary, specialized or critical complement. This collaborative experience has joined creativity, initiative, self-assessment and knowledge of online news production...|$|R
