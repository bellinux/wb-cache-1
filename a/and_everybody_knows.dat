She became so popular in Spain that she was voted for 13 times Best International Singer by the readers of the music magazine Heavy Rock in their annual polls. She often declared to live and tour for the fans and said that she [...] "would never cancel a tour <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> that about me". Lemmy, in a 2003 interview, testified how nice and professional Doro is.|$|E
500|$|In August 2012, Marvel signed Joss Whedon to an {{exclusive}} contract through June 2015 for film and television. With the deal, Whedon would [...] "contribute creatively" [...] on Phase Two of the MCU {{and develop the}} first television series set in the universe. In March 2013, Whedon expanded on his consulting responsibilities, saying, [...] "I understand what Kevin [...] is going for and where he's heading, and I read the scripts and watch cuts {{and talk to the}} directors and writers and give my opinion. Occasionally there could be some writing. But I'm not trying to get in anybody's soup, I'm just trying to be helpful." [...] Whedon later elaborated that [...] "Since the story has already been approved <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> what we're doing with Avengers 2, we can really lay it out. It's not like anyone's saying [...] "well I don't know, what if I need that?" [...] It's like [...] "doing this is troublesome for us, whereas doing this will actually help us." ... You want to honor {{the events of the last}} movie but you don't want to be beholden to them, because some people will see Avengers who did not see any of the movies in between or even Avengers 1." [...] He also found working in television and script doctoring to be [...] "great training ground for dealing with this ... because you're given a bunch of pieces and told to make them fit—even if they don't." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the first}} afternoon, Petrelis, {{dressed in a}} mock {{concentration}} camp uniform with a pink triangle, told a panel on confidentiality, “There’s {{no such thing as}} confidentiality. I can tell you, {{as soon as you get}} on Social Security, your disability is AIDS, <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> it.” Petrelis accused federal health officials of genocide in mishandling the AIDS epidemic and said, “You locked up the Japanese during World War II, and you’ll do it again if you want to. You should start talking about new treatments.” Lavender Hill Mob members also passed out leaflets that said “Test drugs, not people,” and referred to the CDC as “Center for Detention Camps.” ...|$|E

60|$|So, of course, {{as soon as}} Jeff {{made the}} fortune, Myra had her {{resignation}} in next morning <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> that she {{was to go to}} a dramatic school for three months in the fall and become a leading actress.|$|R
60|$|The saises {{looked at}} each other gravely as they rubbed their ponies' legs. This was the time when long purses began to tell, <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> it.

6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> the {{chairman}} {{who comes to}} the meeting with a very imperfect knowledge of who or what the lecturer is, and is driven to introduce him by saying: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "'Says he's goin' down, sir," [...] the {{signaller}} replies. What {{the submarine}} had spelt out, <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> it, was: [...] "Cannot approve of this extremely frightful weather. Am going to bye-bye." ...|$|E
60|$|The new {{government}} was received with considerable coolness. It {{was not only}} a foreign intruder, but a poor one. It was not even worth plucking --except by the smallest of small fry office-seekers <b>and</b> such. <b>Everybody</b> <b>knew</b> that Congress had appropriated only twenty thousand dollars a year in greenbacks for its support--about money enough to run a quartz mill a month. <b>And</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>knew,</b> also, that the first year's money was still in Washington, and that the getting hold of it would be a tedious and difficult process. Carson City was too wary and too wise to open up a credit account with the imported bantling with anything like indecent haste.|$|R
5000|$|... "Waylaying was {{not merely}} tolerated but {{strongly}} recommended, <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> that {{the right way to}} handle it was to get down behind a bush beside the road, wait till your target for tonight rode past you, and then fire at the place where his suspenders crossed, the steadiest part of the man-horse combination." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I {{tell you}} it has not arrived!' she said, with some anger. 'I have not got a lover, <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> I haven't, and it's an insinuating {{thing for you to}} say so!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... --But it's no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all that. That's not {{life for}} men and women, insult and hatred. <b>And</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> that it's the very {{opposite}} of that that is really life.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} {{it will not}} go with my dress," [...] she answered; [...] "and, besides, the Chamberlain's nephew has sent me some real jewels, <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> that jewels cost far more than flowers." ...|$|E
60|$|So Marcella {{went away}} {{and in all}} Bridgeport {{there were only two}} people who {{believed}} she would ever return. There is no keeping a secret in Bridgeport, <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> all about the love affair between Marcella and the doctor and about the promise she had made. Everybody sympathized with the doctor because everybody believed he had lost his sweetheart.|$|R
60|$|Among {{the evening}} magnates {{was a famous}} physician, who <b>knew</b> <b>everybody,</b> <b>and</b> whom <b>everybody</b> <b>knew.</b> On {{entering}} at the door, he came upon Mr Merdle drinking his tea in a corner, and touched him on the arm.|$|R

6000|$|... "I'm not 'xactly sure o' {{the precise}} words in this case, but that's the {{sentiment}}, <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> that sentiment is everything in poetry, whether ye understand it or not. Fire away, leftenant, an' don't be long-winded if ye can help it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The man {{who comes}} after me {{will need a}} wooden overcoat," [...] he promulgated. [...] "I won't stand being hounded. That hostler was pulling his gun on me. I got him first, that's all. It was a fair fight, <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Firstly, {{the space}} {{occupied}} by the Monument is the former site of a bridge that was an important navigational and cultural landmark.3 Local people used {{to take pictures of}} the bridge <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> what you were taking about when you mentioned 'the bridge.'

6000|$|... "And where's my Orson? Didn't he dine at home? Mr Cradell, {{will you}} oblige me by taking my shawl? But perhaps {{you had better}} not. People are so censorious; ain't they, Miss Spruce?

6000|$|... “Tom Stevens,” {{said the}} old woman, “I will ask you {{to go up to}} the rectory with me this very evening.

60|$|The Scilly Isles now {{appeared}} as if directly pointed at by a golden finger issuing from a cloud; <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> how portentous that sight is, {{and how these}} broad rays, whether they light upon the Scilly Isles or upon the tombs of crusaders in cathedrals, always shake the very foundations of scepticism and lead to jokes about God.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{the king}} {{might have gone}} on, still happy and unsuspecting, {{to the end of}} his days, but for one of your modern {{improvements}} --the stock-board.

60|$|The people I lodged with {{told me his}} history. He {{had lived}} there many years, <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> him, but nobody liked him,--a cunning, foxy, {{grabbing}} old rascal; unsocial, suspicious, unutterably mean. Never {{in all the years}} of his life in the village had he given a sixpence or a penny to anyone; nor a cabbage, nor an apple, nor had he ever lent a helping hand to a neighbour nor shown any neighbourly feeling.|$|R
2500|$|Commenting to Rolling Stone Magazine, Bob Seger said: [...] "I {{used to go}} to the Motown Revues, and the Miracles always {{closed the}} show.

6000|$|This {{dialogue}} goes on {{for some}} time. Mrs. Harding keeps shaking her head and saying that Sir John must not go to Kafoonistan, and Sir John says she must not go to Balla Walla. He protests {{that he wants to}} work and she claims that she wants to try to think clearly. But it is all a bluff. They are not going. Neither of them. <b>And</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> it.

60|$|One {{fault of}} Nat's gave the Bhaers much anxiety, {{although}} they saw {{how it had}} been strengthened by fear and ignorance. I regret to say that Nat sometimes told lies.

60|$|Faith's bravado ebbed {{out in a}} sob. She {{ran down}} the steps and flashed out of the side door of the church.

60|$|When he was {{relieved}} of the perplexed affairs that nothing would make plain, through having them returned upon his hands by a dozen agents in succession who could make neither beginning, middle, nor end of them or him, he found his miserable place of refuge a quieter refuge {{than it had been}} before.

6000|$|... "Of course I was a villain. But it {{was only}} once; and your Lordship was so rough to me! I am not saying but what I was a villain.
