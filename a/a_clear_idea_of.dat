5|$|Gravity Bone is a first-person {{adventure}} {{video game}} that lasts around 20 minutes, and {{is set in}} the fictional city of Nuevos Aires. The player controls an unnamed spy, and is tasked with accomplishing several missions across the game's two stages. At the end of the game, the player-controlled spy is killed by an unknown woman after chasing her through {{the last half of the}} second level. The game was designed to leave the player without <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> how the game's story evolves.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{had begun}} {{as early as}} 1911 to procure arms and smuggle them into India. When <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the {{conspiracy}} emerged, more earnest and elaborate plans were made to obtain arms and to enlist international support. Herambalal Gupta, who {{had arrived in the}} United States in 1914 at the Berlin Committee's directives, took over the leadership of American wing of the conspiracy after the failure of the SS Korea mission. Gupta immediately began efforts to obtain men and arms. While men were in plentiful supply with more and more Indians coming forward to join the Ghadarite cause, obtaining arms for the uprising proved to be more difficult.|$|E
5|$|Hardboiled had no {{specific}} {{goal for the}} Allies, other than to convince the Germans of an imminent invasion threat against Norway. Clarke had already established that deception operations should have <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what the enemy {{was supposed to do}} (rather than what they were expected to think). Stanley was unaware of this, not being in communication with Clarke's department in Cairo. As a result, the objective for Hardboiled was chosen because the resources existed and it would not affect real future operations (planners had already rejected Norway as a viable target), rather than for any strategic advantage it brought the Allies. Stanley was also unaware of the extensive double agent network {{under the control of the}} Twenty Committee, having merely been told that MI5 had an avenue through which to pass information to the enemy.|$|E

25|$|I owe {{a lot to}} R. B. Woodward.

He showed me the beauty of modern organic chemistry, and the relevance {{to the field of}} detailed careful reasoning. He showed me that one does not need to specialize. Woodward made great contributions to the strategy of synthesis, to the deduction of difficult structures, to the invention of new chemistry, and to theoretical aspects as well. He taught his students by example the satisfaction that comes from total immersion in our science. I treasure the memory of my association with this remarkable chemist.|$|E

25|$|While he ceded {{much of the}} {{authority}} of the imperial government to the cities, Julian also took more direct control himself. For example, new taxes and corvées had to be approved by him directly rather than left to the judgement of the bureaucratic apparatus. Julian certainly had <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what he wanted Roman society to be, both in political as well as religious terms. The terrible and violent dislocation of the 3rd century meant that the Eastern Mediterranean had become the economic locus of the Empire. If the cities were treated as relatively autonomous local administrative areas, it would simplify the problems of imperial administration, which as far as Julian was concerned, should be focused on the administration of the law and defense of the empire's vast frontiers.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} period of {{exploration}} and development of ideas, premature conference presentations and individual seminars were given by {{various members of the}} Cambridge group in other archaeological departments in England and abroad. Individual scholars who were invited to talk to us in Cambridge in that period often felt, understandably, obliged to maintain a distinct opposition. While it is certainly the case that these presentations had occurred before our views had even begun to settle down, and that they were excessively aggressive, they {{played an important role in}} the process of enquiry and reformulation. In particular, the contrasts which were set up by us and by outside scholars allowed the views of the seminar group, and the differences of viewpoint within the group, to be clarified. The opposition highlighted our own opinion but also threw the spotlight on the blind alleys down which there was a danger of straying. Our aggression resulted from the conviction that we were doing something new. This, too, was important. In the initial period there was <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what was wrong with existing approaches and there was a faith that something else could be done.|$|E
25|$|The first episcopal {{assistant}} of the vicar {{known is}} Angelus de Tineosis, Episcopus Viterbiensis, named 2 October 1321, as {{assistant to the}} Vicar Andreas, Episcopus Terracinensis. His position is not so well outlined in the documents that we can form <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> his duties. It is significant that Angelus officiated as assistant even when the Vicar Andreas was in the city. On the other hand, the Vicar Franciscus Scaccani, Episcopus Nolanus, was allowed to choose an assistant for {{the business of the}} vicariate only in the case of his own absence from Rome. According to this document it was not for the pope but the vicar himself, though authorized thereto by the pope, who chose his own assistant and gave over to him all his authority or faculties, insofar as they were based on law or custom. This shows that the vicarius urbis was firmly established in the fulness of his office and externally recognized as such; certain consuetudinary rights had even at this date grown up and become accepted. We see from the Bullarium Magnum (II, 75) that on 18 October 1412, Pope John XXII nominated Petrus Saccus, a canon of St. Peter's, as locum tenens of the Vicar Franciscus, abbas monasterii S. Martini in Monte Cimino O.S.B., and himself conferred on this official all the faculties of the vicar. The new locum tenens was bidden to take the usual oath before the Apostolic Camera (see above). A similar case is that (1430) of Lucas de Ilpernis, another canon of St. Peter's. When Petrus Accolti, Bishop-elect of Ancona, was named vicarius urbis in 1505, he took over the jurisdiction, but the pontificalia or ceremonial rights were given to Franciscus Berthleay, Bishop of Mylopotamos, until the consecration of Accolti. A similar case is that of Andreas Jacobazzi, a canon of St. Peter's, named vicar in 1519, but not consecrated as Bishop of Lucera until 1520; the pontificalia were committed to Vincentius, Bishop of Ottochaz-Zengg.|$|E

[...] Brown turned to tales of his teenage years, as he had lost contact with most of those he knew from that time.

500|$|While Chahi had <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> how to {{implement}} his game engine, he mostly improvised when creating the actual {{content of the}} game, allowing the game to develop [...] "layer by layer without knowing where it was going." [...] He planned on creating a science fiction game that was similar to Karateka and Impossible Mission. Because he {{wanted to create a}} dramatic, cinematic experience, the game features no HUD or dialog, giving the player only a representation of the surrounding game world during both gameplay elements and the cutscenes progressing the story. However, with no idea of the technical limitations he would face while building out the story, he focused more on creating ambiance, rhythmic pacing, and narrative tension to the game. Chahi resorted to developing his own tool with a new programming language through GFA BASIC coupled with the game's engine in Devpac assembler, to control and animate the game, interpreted in real-time by the game engine, effectively creating his own animation sequencer.|$|E
500|$|Films such as Star Wars, Alien, Blade Runner, , and Starship Troopers were {{significant}} {{influences on the}} atmosphere and artistic qualities of the game. The team chose Jack Wall, who also penned the music for BioWare's 2005 title Jade Empire, as the main composer of Mass Effect due to his ability to produce {{a wide range of}} musical styles. Hudson had <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what kind of music he wanted in the game, but gave Wall certain artistic freedom to express himself. According to Wall, the main vision was to [...] "marry the electronic instrument palatte [...] of the late 70's/early 80's with more organic elements." [...] Wall had never written this style of music before, but composer Sam Hulick helped him develop the electronic sound on a classic orchestral foundation. By the end of the project, composers Richard Jacques and David Kates joined Wall and Hulick to finish the score on time. While a total of 110 minutes of music was written for the game, all in-game and cinematic music was crafted as multiple stems to maximize their use and variety. The game went gold on October 22, 2007.|$|E
500|$|Bacon {{said that}} chance played a {{significant}} role in his work, and that he often approached a canvas without having <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what might emerge. This was especially the case in the mid- to late 1940s, a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms. The following morning he would often approach his canvas [...] "in a bad mood of drinking... under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing." [...] He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work: an image often would morph midway through into something quite different from what he had first intended. He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist. To him, lifestyle and art were intertwined; he said that [...] "perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer." [...] This is very evident in the 1949 series, which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head, but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of Velázquez masterpieces, and arrived at an image that was to preoccupy Bacon for the subsequent 20 years.|$|E
