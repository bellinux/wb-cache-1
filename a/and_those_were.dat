5|$|Armed clashes {{in eastern}} Slavonia {{gradually}} intensified as the JNA committed significant new units to the Battle of Vukovar, including the 453rd Mechanised Brigade, the 1st Proletarian Guards Mechanised Division, and the 252nd Armoured Brigade. During the initial {{stage of the}} battle, the JNA bypassed a number of Croat villages southeast {{of the city of}} Vukovar—including Lovas. In late September 1991, the easternmost Croatian positions in the area ran along a line connecting the villages of Nijemci–Ilača–Lovas <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> defended by the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Guards Brigade and the 109th Infantry Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Early {{freight traffic}} {{consisted}} of agricultural products, including carrots, celery, clover, peas, potatoes, sugar beet and swedes, together with {{large volumes of}} peat from Swinefleet Works near Reedness Junction and from Hatfield Works on the Hatfield Moor Branch. Traffic into the area included manure. In the 1920s, stations notified the control centre at Goole {{of the number of}} wagons they would need for consignments of peas and potatoes, and could also request additional trains. 4,000 tons of green peas were despatched during the 1926 growing season, and in the following year, 7,000 bundles of celery left Epworth station in a three-day period. Traffic started to decline in the 1930s, as motor lorries began {{to take some of the}} trade. By 1937, there were only three workings each day, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> run if required. The peat works at Hatfield was still supplying an average of six wagon-loads per day.|$|E
5|$|Since {{there were}} few posts in Hungary for mathematicians, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> not well-paid, his father wanted von Neumann to follow him into {{industry}} and thereby invest his time in a more financially useful endeavor than mathematics. Von Neumann and his father decided that the best career path {{was to become a}} chemical engineer. This was not something that von Neumann had much knowledge of, so it was arranged for him to take a two-year non-degree course in chemistry at the University of Berlin, after which he sat for the entrance exam to the prestigious ETH Zurich, which he passed in September 1923. At the same time, von Neumann also entered Pázmány Péter University in Budapest, as a Ph.D. candidate in mathematics. For his thesis, he chose to produce an axiomatization of Cantor's set theory. He passed his final examinations for his Ph.D. soon after graduating from ETH Zurich in 1926. He then went to the University of Göttingen on a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to study mathematics under David Hilbert.|$|E

5|$|The {{preceding}} two s {{had been}} assigned to the FY1937 building program, and in 1936, the General Board met to discuss the two battleships to be allocated to FY1938. The General Board argued for two more North Carolinas, but Admiral William H. Standley, the Chief of Naval Operations, wanted the ships to be of a new design. That meant construction could not begin by 1938, so the ships were assigned to FY1939. Design work started in March 1937 and the draft for two battleships was formally approved by the Secretary of the Navy on 23 June. More specific characteristics for the two ships were ironed out, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> approved on 4 January 1938. The ships were formally ordered on 4 April 1938.|$|E

25|$|Alexander Ziskind Mintz, an Ashkenazi merchant, started {{claiming}} in 1846 {{that only}} those growing in Parga are not grafted, and therefore kosher for the ritual. He claimed {{that under the}} previous Ottoman system, citrons could only be planted in Parga {{under the control of}} Ali Pasha, who collected all proceeds for the Ottoman empire, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> thus the only citrons known as kosher and un-grafted through the years. Since the rules have been changed, and farmers are allowed to earn their income and pay only a tax, that's how the plantations have expanded to Agia and Preveza. And since those places are new, no one could not be sure whether those picked from newly planted trees, were grafted or not, at least without careful tree checking upon picking.|$|E
25|$|It is {{also one}} of only two {{denominations}} (the other being the cent) minted in every year from its inception during the first decade of mint operation. However, the order was given by President Thomas Jefferson to halt silver dollar production due to the continued exportation of U.S. dollars. The Spanish 8 Reales, which was slightly heavier than the U.S. dollar, nonetheless traded at a 1-to-1 ratio. So U.S. dollars went to the Caribbean, were traded for heavier 8 Reales, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> then brought back to the U.S., where they would be recoined for free into more U.S. dollars; the difference in silver, then, was kept by the exporter. This ensured that no dollars would circulate in the U.S., but would instead be exported for their heavier counterparts overseas, leaving little but old, foreign money to circulate in the United States in a process known as Gresham's Law.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} 1974, {{with sales}} of D skyrocketing, the future looked bright for Gygax and Kaye, who were only 36 years old. But in January 1975, Kaye {{unexpectedly}} {{died of a heart}} attack. He had not made any specific provision in his will regarding his one-third share of the company, simply leaving his entire estate to his wife Donna. Although she had worked briefly for TSR as an accountant, she had not shared her husband's enthusiasm for gaming, and made it clear that she would not be having anything to do with managing the company. Gygax characterized her as [...] "less than personable... After Don died she dumped all the Tactical Studies Rules materials off on my front porch. It would have been impossible to manage a business with her involved as a partner." [...] After Kaye's death, TSR was forced to relocate from Kaye's dining room to Gygax's basement. In July 1975, Gygax and Blume reorganized their company from a partnership to a corporation called TSR Hobbies. Gygax owned 150 shares, Blume owned the other 100 shares, and both had the option to buy up to 700 shares {{at any time in the}} future. But TSR Hobbies had nothing to publish—D was still owned by the 3-way partnership of TSR, and neither Gygax nor Blume had the money to buy out the shares owned by Kaye's wife. Blume persuaded a reluctant Gygax to allow his father, Melvin Blume, to buy Donna's shares, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> converted to 200 shares in TSR Hobbies. In addition, Brian bought another 140 shares. These purchases reduced Gygax from the majority shareholder in control of the company to minority shareholder; he effectively became the Blumes' employee.|$|E
500|$|In September 1835, Thomas Sully {{received}} from Patterson {{a set of}} British coins and medals to help guide him while creating the Seated Liberty design. Sully sent Patterson three rough sketches {{near the beginning of}} October, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> given to Gobrecht, who in turn set about making a copper engraving of the design. Gobrecht completed the engraving on October 14, and Patterson presented prints created from it to several government officials in an effort to gain their approval. President Jackson, Treasury Secretary Levi Woodbury, {{and the rest of the}} cabinet all approved of the design. On October 17, while Jackson and his cabinet were reviewing the design, Woodbury wrote Patterson giving permission to proceed with creating dies for the new coins based on the prints. In January 1836, die trials were conducted in soft metal. These pieces were then circulated among the public for suggestions. Patterson then authorized production of a steel obverse die; the reverse could not yet be created because Peale had yet to complete his design to Patterson's satisfaction. While Peale continued his work, Gobrecht began work on a design for a gold dollar, which occupied much of his time at the Mint. On April 9, Patterson wrote a letter to the Treasury secretary in which he included several of Peale's drawings; Patterson viewed one of the designs as the best created to date. Despite the director's approval of the design, he instructed Peale to continue until Patterson was satisfied. This was evidently achieved, because Patterson had Gobrecht to begin work on a reverse die in June. In August, Patterson sent a uniface striking of the reverse die to President Jackson, who approved designs for both sides of the coin ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{political}} crisis of 1458 {{was the first}} serious challenge to the Medici rule. The cost of wars had been borne by the great families of Florence, and disproportionately so by Medici's opponents. A number of them (Serragli, Baroncelli, Mancini, Vespucci, Gianni) were practically ruined and had to sell their properties, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> acquired by Medici's partisans at bargain prices. The opposition used partial relaxation of Medici control of the republic institutions to demand political reforms, freedom of speech in the councils and a greater share in the decision-making. [...] Medici's party response was to use threats of force from private armies and Milanese troops and arranging a popular assembly dominated by Cosimo's supporters. It exiled the opponents of the regime and introduced the open vote in councils, ``in order to unmask the anti-Medician rebels".|$|E
