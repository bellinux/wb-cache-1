5|$|On 5 September 1986, four ANO gunmen hijacked Pan Am Flight 73 at Karachi Airport on its {{way from}} Mumbai to New York, holding 389 {{passengers}} and crew for 16 hours in the plane on the tarmac before detonating grenades inside the cabin. Neerja Bhanot, the flight's senior purser, was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> an emergency door, and most passengers escaped; 20 died, including Bhanot, and 120 were wounded. The London Times reported in March 2004 that Libya had been behind the hijacking.|$|E
5|$|Failed {{oxygen and}} {{ethylene}} glycol pipes near the fire's origin point continued burning an intense secondary fire which melted through the cabin floor. By the time firefighters were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> the hatch, {{the fire had}} extinguished itself. The back of Chaffee's couch {{was found in the}} horizontal position, with the lower portion angled towards the floor. His helmet was closed and locked, his restraints were undone, and the hoses and electrical connections to the suit remained connected. As he was farthest from the origin of the fire, he suffered the least burn and suit damage.|$|E
5|$|Sidney George Barnes (5 June 1916 – 16 December 1973) was an Australian cricketer and cricket writer, {{who played}} 13Test matches between 1938 and 1948. <b>Able</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> the innings or bat down the order, Barnes was {{regarded}} as one of Australia's finest batsmen in the period immediately following the Second World War. He helped create an enduring record when scoring 234in the second Test against England at Sydney in December 1946; exactly the same score as his captain, Don Bradman, in the process setting a world-record 405run fifth wicket partnership. Barnes averaged 63.05 over 19innings in a career that, like those of most of his contemporaries, was interrupted by the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|Sound Transit {{underwent}} a funding crisis in 2001 after the Central Link light rail project {{was found to}} be over budget and would not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> until 2009, three years later than planned. The light rail project was truncated to Westlake station in Downtown Seattle and to Tukwila, the sections north of downtown and south to the airport being deferred to a later date. The King County Council called for a new agreement to be negotiated with Sound Transit adding requirements for an adopted plan for light rail service to Northgate, and for a study into new riders that light rail would bring to the tunnel over a conventional bus network. In early 2002, Sound Transit also explored, and ultimately rejected, a proposal to build a parallel, rail-only tunnel under 5th Avenue that would cost $1 billion.|$|E
5|$|The Mari Lwyd itself {{consists}} of a horse's skull that is decorated with ribbons and affixed to a pole; {{to the back of}} the skull is attached a white sheet, which drapes down to conceal both the pole and the individual carrying this device. On occasion, the horse's head was represented not by a skull but was instead made from wood or even paper. In some instances, the horse's jaw was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> and close as a result of string or lever attached to it, and there are accounts of pieces of glass being affixed into the eye sockets of some examples, representing eyes. An observer of the tradition as it was performed at Llangynwyd during the nineteenth century noted that preparation for the activity was a communal event, with many locals involving themselves in the decorating of the Mari Lwyd.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} idea behind Slackers first occurred in 1990. Along with some friends, Kurt Jellinek and Paul Zacharias {{went to a}} Don Henley concert, and began thinking about owning their own music store. At the time, the two were undergraduate students, and decided to focus their studies on business management and becoming entrepreneurs. Slackers CDs and Games was officially founded in 1993, by Jellinek and Zacharias, in Columbia, Missouri. Jellinek and Zacharias opened the store after graduating from Saint Louis University, using only their own collection of 1,500 music CDs. The name originated from their generation being considered slackers before being {{given a chance to}} prove otherwise. Although business was slow at first, with the store sometimes only making US$30 in a day, business eventually increased. After 2years they were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> a second location in O'Fallon, Illinois. As of 2009, there are 10 locations in the states of Missouri and Illinois, eight of which are in the St. Louis Metropolitan Area, and two of which are in Mid-Missouri.|$|E

5|$|The {{plan was}} {{initially}} frustrated by light winds, but by 14:25 Blonde and Thetis were {{within range of}} the gun batteries and fifteen minutes later they were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> fire on the flûtes, although still at quite a distance. Becalmed in the bay, Blonde was forced to engage one of the forts instead, fire from the shore causing some damage {{but not enough to}} endanger the ship. Thetis was luckier, and Captain Miller was able to close with one of the French ships, although their identities during the engagement are uncertain in historical accounts and it is not clear which one was first into the action. By 15:35, Thetis had dismasted her opponent, which surrendered. Moving against the second ship, Thetis was then also becalmed and was forced to engage the forts instead. As Sceptre led the remainder of the squadron into the bay, fire was seen spreading through the surrendered ship and, in the face of overwhelming opposition, the second flûte also surrendered at 16:20.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{including}} {{trees are}} important in mythology and religion, where they symbolise themes such as fertility, growth, immortality and rebirth, and may {{be more or less}} magical. Thus in Latvian mythology, Austras Koks is a tree which grows {{from the start of the}} Sun's daily journey across the sky. A different cosmic tree is Yggdrasil, the World tree of Norse mythology, on which Odin hung. Different again is the barnacle tree, believed in the Middle Ages to have barnacles that opened to reveal geese, a story which may perhaps have started from an observation of goose barnacles growing on driftwood. Greek mythology mentions many plants and flowers, where for example the lotus tree bears a fruit that causes a pleasant drowsiness, while moly is a magic herb mentioned by Homer in the Odyssey with a black root and white blossoms. Magic plants are found, too, in Serbian mythology, where the raskovnik is supposed to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> any lock. In Buddhist symbolism, both the lotus and the Bodhi Tree are significant. The lotus is one of the Ashtamangala (eight auspicious signs) shared between Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism, representing the primordial purity of body, speech, and mind, floating above the muddy waters of attachment and desire. The Bodhi Tree is the sacred fig tree under which the Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment; the name is also given to other Bodhi trees thought to have been propagated from the original tree.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor, suspecting {{that the}} {{wardrobe}} contains the evil George fears, opens {{it to find}} its contents are simply clothes and toys, including a doll house. The Doctor suddenly recalls from Alex's photo album that Claire did not appear pregnant in {{the weeks leading up}} to George's supposed birth, causing Alex to remember the fact that Claire was unable to have children. The Doctor asserts that George is a Tenza child, an empathic alien who took on the form of Alex and Claire's desired child through a perception filter, and has the ability to literally lock away his fears in the wardrobe. George begins to panic from this revelation and the Doctor and Alex are pulled into the wardrobe, joining Rory in the dollhouse. As the dolls descend on the three, the Doctor calls out to George to face his fears; George is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> the wardrobe and appears in the dollhouse, but the dolls turn to advance on him. The Doctor realises that George is still frightened that Alex and Claire plan to send him away, having mistakenly interpreted a conversation they had earlier that night; Alex rushes through the dolls to embrace George as his son. They all soon find themselves back at the estate, restored to normal. Claire returns the next morning to find George no longer scared while Alex and the Doctor make him breakfast. After being thanked, the Doctor rejoins his companions to set off for their next adventure.|$|E

5|$|The {{story begins}} in a {{different}} place for each playable character. With the exception of Carlie, the main character is soon told (or otherwise decides) to seek the advice of the Priest of Light in the Holy City Wendel. They arrive at the city of Jadd soon after the Beastmen have invaded. Due to the Beastmen's werewolf powers, they are able to make an escape by night. The main character—now including Carlie—on the way to Wendel stays overnight in Astoria where they are woken by a bright light. Following it, it reveals itself to be a Faerie from the Mana Sanctuary, exhausted by her journey. Out of desperation, the Faerie chooses the main character to be her host, and tells them to get to Wendel. There, while they explain their grievances to the Priest of Light, the Faerie interrupts and explains that the Mana Tree is dying and that the Sanctuary is in danger. The Priest explains that if the Tree dies, the God Beasts will reawaken and destroy the world. He goes on to explain further that, because the Faerie has chosen the main character as its host, they must travel to the Sanctuary to draw the Sword of Mana from the foot of the Mana Tree. They can then restore peace to the world, and have their wishes granted by the Mana Goddess if the sword is drawn before the Tree dies. A great deal of power is needed to open the gate to the Sanctuary. The Faerie does not have the strength to do it, and the ancient spell which would do so by unlocking the power in the Mana Stones also takes the caster's life. The Stones' guarding elemental spirits, however, will to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> the gate if their powers are combined.|$|E
