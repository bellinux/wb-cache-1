40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: The {{design of}} {{suitable}} air collectors {{is one of}} the most important factors controlling the economics of the solar drying. <b>Air</b> <b>type</b> <b>collectors</b> have two inherent disadvantages: Low thermal capacity of air and low absorber to air heat transfer coefficient. Different modifications are suggested and applied to improve the heat transfer coefficient between the absorber plate and air. These modifications include the use of extended heat transfer area, such as finned absorber. Approach: The efficiency of the solar collector has been examined by changing the solar radiation and the mass flow rate. An analytical and experimental study to investigate the effect of mass flow rate and solar radiation on thermal efficiency were conducted. The theoretical solution procedure of the energy equations uses a matrix inversion method and making some algebraic rearrangements. Results: The average error on calculating thermal efficiency was about 7 %. The optimum efficiency, about 70 % lies between the mass flow rates 0. 07 - 0. 08 kg sec− 1. The thermal efficiencies increase with flow rate and it increase about 30 % at mass flow rate of 0. 04 - 0. 08 kg sec− 1. Conclusion: The efficiency is increased proportional to mass flow rate and solar radiation and. the efficiency of the collector is strongly dependent on the flow rate.

40|$|AbstractTo improve {{indoor air}} quality, {{appropriate}} ventilation is essential. Ventilation, somewhat contributes to heat loss. Heat recovery ventilation (HRV) system presents solutions to exchange discarded heat of exhaust air with incoming outdoor air. Photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) {{system is the}} technology for producing electricity in PV module and using heat at {{the back side of}} the panel for hot water heating system simultaneously. Heated air from an air-type PV/T can be coupled with HRV system for preheating instead of outside air intake. Thus the ventilation efficiency can be improved. With heated air of an air-type PV/T collector, freezing and dew condensation problems in traditional HRV system caused by low temperature air during winter, can be resolved. The performance of <b>air</b> <b>type</b> PV/T <b>collector</b> coupled with HRV has been studied experimentally...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- solar {{air heaters}} {{are used for}} {{applications}} at low and moderate temperatures such as; crop drying, timber seasoning, and space heating. This method substantially improves the collector efficiency by increasing the fluid velocity and enhancing the heat-transfer coefficient between the absorber plate and <b>air.</b> These <b>types</b> of <b>collectors</b> had been designed as a proposal to use an absorbing plate made of aluminium cans into the double-pass channel in a flat-plate to build absorber plates of SAHs at a suitable cost. In the first type (Type I), cans had been staggered as in order on absorber plate, while in Type II they were arranged in zigzag. Type III is a flat plate arrange with baffles. For the same flow rate, {{the efficiency of the}} double pass is found to be higher than the single pass. An efficiency test was used to find the best fin arrangement of the receiver. Air enters the upper channel and lower channel of the air heater flows to outside in the parallel direction. If 2 - 10 m/s speed limit of air in piping system is assumed, proposed some arrangement fin technology enables an efficiency improvement in relation to the smooth pipe arrangement of the solar collector with black paint...|$|R

When larvae reached the pediveliger stage (day 25), black-colored spat <b>collectors</b> ("envelope" <b>type)</b> {{composed of the}} following materials were offered as settlement substrates: onion bag, mosquito net, fishing net, and 63 % shade-cloth. Spat collectors measured 30 x 30 cm and were composed of an outer bag and inner substrate made of the same material. The influence {{of the color of}} spat collector material on recruitment was investigated using a second <b>type</b> of spat <b>collector</b> composed of onion bags as the outer bag and inner substrate ("bag" type). Bags were prepared in 3 different outer/inner (O/I) color combinations of green/green, green/black, and red/black (O/I). Both <b>types</b> of <b>collectors</b> were deployed at different depths within settlement tanks. Approximately 2. 7 % of the initial larval population survived, resulting in 35, 583 spat. Of these, 71. 3 % recruited to bag <b>type</b> <b>collectors,</b> 21. 9 % to envelope <b>type</b> <b>collectors,</b> and 6. 8 % to the surfaces of the culture tanks. Spat recruitment was significantly affected by collector material (P < 0. 01), with fishing net and shade-cloth yielding highest and lowest density of spat, respectively. Similarly, spat collector color combination significantly influenced spat collection (P < 0. 01), with higher recruitment to red and green substrates. For both spat <b>collector</b> <b>types,</b> there was significantly greater (P < 0. 01) recruitment of spat to collectors {{in the middle of the}} water column (60 - 90 -cm depth). This study showed that both the type and color of material used for spat collectors, as well as depth of deployment, influenced recruitment of P. mazatlanica spat.

40|$|AbstractWith the {{objective}} of reducing costs and proliferating use, a special Direct Solar Irradiation Collector (DSIC) solar water heater was developed. To produce a commercially feasible product, a full research and development program was conducted that included several generations of prototypes {{and a range of}} design criteria such as material selection, manufacturing processes, economics, and materials availability. The result was a Parallel Plate <b>type</b> <b>collector</b> made out of polymers which is designed for temperate weather and low pressure household-use. It is able to achieve similar efficiencies and performance than commercial water heaters while cutting its cost by half. The present study introduces the concept and includes numerical and experimental results made on a scaled prototype. The numerical analysis compares the pressure-drop across 3 collectors. The pressure-drop is better by almost a factor of 4 when comparing the DSIC and a Parallel Tubes <b>type</b> <b>collector.</b> Performance tests were conducted outdoors to measure the temperature and solar irradiation as a function of time. Different ratios between collection area and water volume were tested.

The objectives of the study were to evaluate the system behavior, the effect of wing length, and to compare the performance of the systems with wing type and linear CPCs. A detailed dynamic simulation model was developed based on mass and energy balance equations. The simulation results show that the system performance with wing type CPC increases by up to 6 % in the summer and up to 2 % in the winter, compared to the performance with a linear CPC having same collector length. The ice production also increases up to 13 % in the summer with the wing type CPC. This shows that the wing type CPC is helpful to increase the performance of the system compared to the linear CPC with the same collector length and without the need for tracking...|$|R

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} parametric {{study has}} been carried out in this paper on the thermal performance of cross-corrugated solar air collectors. These collectors consists of a wavelike absorbing plate and a wavelike bottom plate which are crosswise positioned to form the air flow channel. Two <b>types</b> of these <b>collectors</b> are considered. For the <b>Type</b> 1 <b>collector,</b> the wavelike shape of the absorbing plate is along the flow direction and that of the bottom plate is perpendicular to the flow direction, while for the <b>Type</b> 2 <b>collector</b> it is the wavelike shape of the bottom plate that is along the flow direction and that of the absorbing plate is perpendicular to the flow direction. The aim of the use of the cross-corrugated absorbing plate and bottom plate is to enhance the turbulence and the heat transfer rate inside the air flow channel which are crucial to the improvement of efficiencies of solar air collectors. To quantify the achievable improvements with the cross-corrugated absorbing and bottom plates, a flat-plate solar air collector which has both a flat absorbing plate and a flat bottom plate, is also considered. The thermal performance of these three <b>types</b> of solar <b>air</b> <b>collector</b> are analyzed and compared under various configurations and operating conditions. The results show that although the thermal performance of the <b>Type</b> 2 <b>collector</b> is just slightly superior to that of the <b>Type</b> 1 <b>collector</b> both of these cross-corrugated solar air collectors have a significantly superior thermal performance to that of the flat-plate one. It is also found that to achieve a higher collector efficiency, it is essential to construct the collectors having slender configurations along the air flow direction, to maintain a small mean gap between the absorbing plate and bottom plate, to use selected coatings on the absorbing plate and glass cover, to maintain a higher air mass flow rate, and to operate the collectors with the inlet fluid temperature close to that of the ambient fluid...|$|R
