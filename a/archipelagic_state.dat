50|$|An <b>archipelagic</b> <b>state</b> is any internationally {{recognized}} state or country that comprises {{a series of}} islands that form an archipelago.

5000|$|According to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, a nation's {{internal}} waters include waters on the landward {{side of the}} baseline of a nation's territorial waters, except in <b>archipelagic</b> <b>states.</b> It includes waterways such as rivers and canals, and sometimes the water within small bays.|$|R
40|$|The {{creation}} of a legal framework governing <b>archipelagic</b> <b>states</b> {{has been an important}} innovation of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC) Part IV of this Convention confers upon such states the right to draw archipelagic baselines joining the outermost points of their archipelagos and to exercise sovereignty over the enclosed waters. However, the LOSC grants this right only to 'archipelagic states', which are defined as states 'constituted wholly by one or more archipelagos'. Dependent outlying archipelagos may not benefit from the application of this special protective regime since they do not fall within the purview of the Convention's definition of <b>archipelagic</b> <b>states.</b> Thus, the question of the legal regime applicable to dependent outlying archipelagos arises.

50|$|Indonesia, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, New Zealand, Maldives, the Bahamas, Greece, Hawaii, the Polynesian {{islands and}} the Azores are {{examples}} of well-known archipelagos. The largest <b>archipelagic</b> <b>state</b> {{in the world by}} area and population is Indonesia. The archipelago with the most islands is the Swedish East Coast Archipelago, which contains the Stockholm archipelago, which, in turn, connects to the world's second largest archipelago, the Archipelago Sea in Finland.|$|E
5000|$|Waters landward of the {{baseline}} {{are defined as}} internal waters, over which the state has complete sovereignty: not even innocent passage is allowed. Lakes and rivers are considered internal waters. All [...] "archipelagic waters" [...] within the outermost islands of an <b>archipelagic</b> <b>state</b> such as Indonesia or the Philippines are also considered internal waters, and are treated {{the same with the}} exception that innocent passage through them must be allowed. However, archipelagic states may designate certain sea lanes through these waters.|$|E
5000|$|In inland waters, {{sovereignty}} {{of the state is}} equal to that which it exercises on the mainland. The coastal state is free to make laws relating to its internal waters, regulate any use, and use any resource. In the absence of agreements to the contrary, foreign vessels have no right of passage within internal waters, and this lack of right to innocent passage is the key difference between internal waters and territorial waters. The [...] "archipelagic waters" [...] within the outermost islands of archipelagic states are treated as internal waters with the exception that innocent passage must be allowed, although the <b>archipelagic</b> <b>state</b> may designate certain sea lanes in these waters.|$|E
5000|$|Archipelagic waters: The {{convention}} set {{the definition}} of <b>Archipelagic</b> <b>States</b> in Part IV, which also defines how the state can draw its territorial borders. A baseline is drawn between the outermost points of the outermost islands, subject to these points being sufficiently close to one another. All waters inside this baseline are designated <b>Archipelagic</b> Waters. The <b>state</b> has sovereignty over these waters (like internal waters), but subject to existing rights including traditional fishing rights of immediately adjacent states. Foreign vessels have right of innocent passage through archipelagic waters (like territorial waters).|$|R
40|$|The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) {{contained}} a specific section for “Archipelagic States” (Part IV) which are given many {{rights under the}} archipelagic regime including, if desired, to designate archipelagic sea lanes (ASLs) through their archipelagic waters. While designation of ASLs is optional, regardless of ASL status, the right of archipelagic sea lane passage (ASLP) for all maritime users is guaranteed. This thesis examines {{the case of the}} Republic of the Philippines in designating ASLs and the influences impacting this process at the state and international levels. This thesis argues that the process of adoption of archipelagic sea lanes by mid-ocean <b>archipelagic</b> <b>states</b> is one which favours the maritime powers over the <b>archipelagic</b> <b>states.</b> Further, in relation to the Philippine case, the efforts of the Republic of the Philippines in repeating some actions undertaken by Indonesia during its case, will strengthen the international system bias and end in a result which will be the by-product of interests other than that of the Philippine state...|$|R
50|$|<b>Archipelagic</b> <b>states</b> are {{states that}} are {{composed}} of groups of islands forming a state as a single unit, with the islands and the waters within the baselines as internal waters. Under this concept ("archipelagic doctrine"), an archipelago shall {{be regarded as a}} single unit, so that the waters around, between, and connecting the islands of the archipelago, irrespective of their breadth and dimensions, form part of the internal waters of the state, and are subject to its exclusive sovereignty.|$|R
50|$|The Philippine {{claim to}} Kalayaan on a {{geographical}} basis can be summarised using {{the assertion that}} Kalayaan is distinct from other island groups in the South China Sea, {{because of the size}} of the biggest island in the Kalayaan group. A second argument used by the Philippines regarding their geographical claim over the Spratlys is that all the islands claimed by the Philippines lie within its 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone according to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This argument assumes that the islands were res nullius. The Philippines also contend, under maritime law that the People's Republic of China can not extend its baseline claims to the Spratlys because the PRC is not an <b>archipelagic</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E

40|$|A crucial, almost revolutionary, {{development}} in the International {{law of the sea}} was the recognition of <b>archipelagic</b> <b>state</b> principles within the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 (LOSC). The essential features of <b>archipelagic</b> <b>state</b> principle laid down by Part IV of LOSC include permission to draw straight archipelagic baselines around the outermost points of the outermost islands of archipelagos; and the recognition of the new and distinct legal regime of archipelagic water for the waters thus enclosed of a nature designed to accommodate the interests of maritime user states, that are states which carry out certain activities, including navigation, in the water areas falling under the jurisdiction of archipelagic states. Since this principle has been Indonesian national philosophical outlook even before the adoption of LOSC and provided within Article 25 (a) of the Indonesian Constitutions, it is submitted that all Indonesian national legislations related to ocean affairs should be based on the <b>archipelagic</b> <b>state</b> principles.

40|$|As one of {{the proponents}} of the <b>archipelagic</b> <b>State</b> concept, Indonesia {{considers}} the <b>archipelagic</b> <b>State</b> regime as Nusantara.

These balances of interest stipulated in the provision of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 (LOSC). Indonesia seems very satisfied when the <b>archipelagic</b> <b>state</b> concept has been adopted in the LOSC, but there are many issues exist when discussing the implementation of the Nusantara.

Resulting from the third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III) between 1973 and 1982, the Convention has created many new regulations applicable to nation states. Once signed, the Convention had established two maritime zones with governing international regulations, affixed the maximum depth-level at sea at twelve miles, created specific regimes for international and <b>archipelagic</b> <b>states,</b> and introduced three new international institutions.|$|R

40|$|The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC) {{provides}} {{a delicate balance}} between the interests of <b>archipelagic</b> <b>States</b> such as Indonesia {{and the international community}} with respect to navigation. Indonesia recognises three navigation rights and freedoms within Indonesian waters: innocent passage, transit passage and archipelagic sea lanes passage. In addition, Indonesia and Malaysia have negotiated an additional passage right not mentioned in the LOSC called access and communication passage. The vagueness and ambiguity of the LOSC provisions on navigational rights and freedoms, as well as the absence of further guidance on their interpretation and implementation, have resulted in conflicting claims between Indonesia on one hand and the international community on the other. This thesis aims to provide an analysis of the legal issues relating to navigation through and over Indonesian waters. In particular, it aims to examine inconsistencies between Indonesian navigational regimes and those permitted by the LOSC to ascertain if Indonesia has applied the LOSC correctly and, if necessary, to propose reforms to harmonise national legislation with international law. Specifically, the thesis will first, explain the extent, historical development and concept of navigational regimes in the LOSC and international law in general.

40|$|In general, {{communities}} in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are socioeconomically and environmentally vulnerable {{due to their}} geographical and ecological conditions. Small <b>archipelagic</b> <b>states</b> are even more vulnerable in terms of natural and human-induced disasters because of their fragmentation, isolation and smallness. Good governance is a vital precondition to reduce the vulnerability of these states. This study examines these two correlated phenomena, governance and vulnerability, their inter-related implications and complications, {{and the role of}} governance in reducing vulnerability of SIDS and their island communities. It also proposes some practical remedies for the challenges of these communities. Qualitative research using multiple methods, secondary data collection, informal semi-structured interviews, open-ended discussions, informal conversational interviews and direct observations, was carried out through case studies of two archipelagos, the republics of Maldives and Vanuatu. In addition, the New Zealand local government model with a focus on Bay of Plenty Region was also studied in order to seek policy models and best practices from a developed state. The field inquiry revealed that an effective local governance system is vitally important to address socio-economic and environmental vulnerability of these archipelagic communities. Neither a rigid centralised system, like the Maldives, nor a decentralised system, {{as in the case of}} Vanuatu, was found to be appropriate and effective unless certain functions are delegated and local authorities are made selfreliant, financially and functionally self-sufficient and aware of their responsibilities through education, while community members are empowered by providing more socio-economic opportunities. Based on the research findings, the thesis highlights four key causes of increasing vulnerability in these communities: absence of a reliable outreach mechanism for emergency management, lack of a strong local governance system, scarcity of socioeconomic resources and opportunities, and inadequate socio-economic infrastructures. The thesis suggests possible ways forward by proposing a four tier cluster approach with a decentralised emergency management system and local governance model. The transient vulnerability (natural or weather related disasters) of these archipelagic communities cannot be addressed unless their chronic vulnerability, lack of socio-economic opportunities, is addressed through sound local governance...|$|R
40|$|Prikaz knjigeBook review: This book {{is part of}} a three-volume manual {{prepared}} by the International Maritime Law Institute (IMLI) to serve as a guide to all aspects of international maritime law. The general editor of the entire series is Professor David Joseph Attard, IMLI Director, while editors of Volume I under review, dedicated to {{the law of the sea}} aspect, are Malgosia Fitzmaurice, professor of public international law at the University of London and Norman A Martínez Gutiérrez, assistant professor at IMLI. Koji Sekimizu, former IMO Secretary- General, wrote the foreword to the manual. This book provides a comprehensive analysis of a very complex field of international law – that of the law of the sea, by discussing traditional and contemporary issues from both theoretical and practical perspectives. In its analysis, it uses various sources, such as treaty and customary international law, ‘’soft law’’ instruments, and court and commercial practice. Reference is also made to the relevant legal framework contained in the regional and national legislation. The main discussion is centered around the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC). In this respect, the book contains an in-depth study of a number of the LOSC provisions and jurisprudence. The book includes an introduction and 24 chapters, all of which have been written and edited by the leading experts in their respective fields. The introduction provides an overview of the historical development of the law of the sea, offering thereby a good foundation for further discussion on the modern law of the sea and the post-LOSC developments. The 24 chapters cover different legal regimes for the seas and oceans, largely following the LOSC zonal approach and structure. The book thus covers territorial sea and contiguous zone, straits used for international navigation, the regime of islands and rocks, <b>archipelagic</b> <b>states,</b> the continental shelf, the exclusive economic zone, the high seas, the international seabed area, marine scientific research, landlocked and geographically disadvantaged states, and the settlement of disputes. Particular consideration is given to international law concerning maritime boundary delimitation. Other chapters examine new trends and challenges that have emerged in the post-LOSC era – for example, the legal status of the generic resources beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. In this respect, reference is made to the current discussions taking place in an ad hoc working group established by the United Nations General Assembly. Attention is further given to the recent developments in the field of marine scientific research, which show an increasing use of the satellites. In this regard, the book points to the possible creation of a new, hybrid, area of law, with the potential of the law of the sea and space law being merged in an innovative way. As a result of increasing concerns relating to global warming and climate change, including the rapid melting of a substantive amount of the ice in the polar regions, particular consideration is given to the legal regimes applicable in the Arctic and the Antarctic. The book covers other contemporary issues as well, such as the protection of underwater cultural heritage, and the interaction between the law of the sea and human rights. Special consideration is given to the LOSC settlement of disputes mechanism and the respective contributions of the International Court of Justice and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. The book moreover examines the role of the various international organisations in the progressive development of the law of the sea such as the United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the International Maritime Organization. This book represents a significant contribution to the current literature in the field. It is intended to serve as a guide on various aspects of international law of the sea for an extensive group of users ranging from students, researchers and academics to practitioners and governmental officials...|$|R
40|$|Tuvalu, an <b>archipelagic</b> nation <b>state</b> {{in central}} Oceania, is being {{transformed}} by climate change, particularly sea level rise. Its islands {{are also being}} represented in new ways in climate change discourses such as journalism and environmentalist campaigns. This research in the interdisciplinary field of island studies also draws from insights in cultural geography and anthropology to examine representations ofthe Tuvalu islands in climate change discourses. The central idea underpinning the work's analytical framework is the islograph, taken to be coherent suites of island representations and their constitutive roles in relations of power. In a significant discursive moment in which climate change is being understood as the global environmental crisis, Tuvalu is taking on new meanings that demand documentation and critical analysis. Such meanings are tied to an extant and remarkably strong presence of islands in Western discourses. Analysis of Tuvalu's islographs - {{many of which are}} produced by Westerners engaged in climate change discourses - considers whether and how its islands are paradoxical spaces and mechanisms of relational identity construction that function as mirrors of the self and a means of identity construction in relation to distant and different others. Islographs of Tuvalu that are analysed in detail in this work include the following: Mark Lynas' popular science monograph High Tide, which aims to redefine Tuvalu as a frontier of climate change and a spur to action on climate change at the global level; various activities of environmentalist non-government organisation Alofa Tuvalu which try to reposition Tuvalu as the rightful space in which global lessons for sustainable living are to be learned; Sydney Morning Herald articles, where, as the islands disappear, Tuvaluans are transformed into environmental refugees and yet Western tourists are also urged to turn a voyeuristic eye towards the 'disappearing islands'; and interviews with participants in climate change discourses. I demonstrate that in such discourses Tuvalu's islographs are structured by a paradox: its islands constituted as separate from and yet embedded in global climate change trajectories; its inhabitants simultaneously identified as subjects of compassion and objects of voyeurism. Such a paradox is embodied in recurring images of Tuvalu as valuable yet expendable - the 'canary in the coalmine' of climate change for Earth. Meanwhile, among professionals in Tuvalu who are engaged in climate change debate - politicians, bureaucrats, community elders, educators, journalists, and pastors - attempts are being made to reclaim Tuvalu as inherently valuable space. Their islographs link Tuvalu to the rest of planet Earth - not in service to it as a litmus test, but connected to and embedded in common rights and responsibilities of humanity to advance environmental stewardship and cultural diversity...|$|R
