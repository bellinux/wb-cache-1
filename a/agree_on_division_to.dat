50|$|Lowering the {{homosexual}} age of consent had last been addressed by Parliament in 1994, when the then Conservative MP Edwina Currie proposed {{an amendment to}} the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill to lower the age of consent to sixteen years. Over forty Tories joined Mrs Currie in the aye lobby, a number which ought easily to have been sufficient to overturn the Government’s small majority at the time. In fact, the measure was lost by twenty-seven votes. It transpired that thirty-eight Labour MPs had opposed the motion. Immediately afterwards, MPs <b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> <b>division</b> (427 <b>to</b> 162) to reduce the age of consent for homosexual sexual activities to eighteen. The election of a Labour Government in 1997 afforded Parliament a further opportunity to examine the issue.|$|R

Bradlaugh [...] "respectfully refused" [...] to obey an order of the House which was [...] "against the law." [...] The Conservative leader Sir Stafford Northcote {{successfully}} moved a motion that Bradlaugh be required <b>to</b> withdraw (<b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> a <b>division</b> by 326 <b>to</b> 38, Liberal MPs being unwilling to challenge a motion which sustained the House's legal authority) but Bradlaugh [...] "positively refused to obey." [...] The Serjeant-at-Arms was sent for and led Bradlaugh out to the Bar of the House, but Bradlaugh then immediately returned to the table claiming to take the Oath. At this Sir Stafford Northcote moved that Bradlaugh be taken into custody. The House <b>agreed,</b> <b>on</b> a <b>division</b> by 274 votes to 7 and Bradlaugh was taken to the small prison cell located under Big Ben in the Clock Tower.|$|R

In September they located the treasure ship Great Mohammed transporting Turkish pilgrims. Chivers and Culliford attacked and looted it in what would become {{on one of the}} richest prizes ever taken by pirates. The Pelican was a slower ship, and though Wheeler fired cannons at the Great Mohammed, the others refused to share the plunder. They gave Wheeler a little money and some water and the Pelican departed.|$|R

50|$|Conflict is not {{the only}} way that parties can {{appropriate}} resources. Depending on the risk preferences of the agents, a simple division of the contested resource according to a settlement can be envisioned. A two-stage game serves to illustrate this. In the first stage, parties make their gun choices. In the second stage, negotiations take place. If the negotiations are successful, the players <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> a <b>division</b> and share the good.|$|R

In the postwar period Lürssen sets a new standard for fast patrol boats. They launched the Jaguar in 1959, especially developed for the German Navy. At 42 meters, the ships are larger than those built during WWII. They serve as a model for future fast patrol boat designs.|$|R

There are international policies with determinate exchange rates if the world economy satisfies a strong efficiency criterion. Also, the corresponding equilibrium allocations are {{in the core of}} the world economy for certain international policies. Hence, a system of fixed exchange rates can support efficient allocations to the extent that countries <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> a <b>division</b> of seigniorage in the creation of international reserves...|$|R

Napoleon also sent an auxiliary corps, consisting of troops from France, Spain and the Netherlands, led by Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, to Denmark to participate in the invasion of Sweden. But British naval superiority prevented the armies from crossing the Øresund strait, and the war came mainly to be fought along the Swedish-Norwegian border.
