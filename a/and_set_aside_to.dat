50|$|To prepare rellenitos, plantains are {{cut into}} {{medium-sized}} pieces and boiled with cinnamon until tender. Once they are tender, normally after {{about ten minutes}} of cooking time they are removed, mashed into a paste <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> cool. The paste is then formed into a small thick tortilla by hand, leaving the center indented resembling a small bowl. The bowl is then filled {{with a mixture of}} black refried beans, chocolate and cinnamon. The filling itself is made by melting Guatemalan or Mayan chocolate in water and then adding refried beans and cinnamon. The bowl is then closed by wrapping the ends of the tortilla until it closes, creating something that resembles an egg — the plantain paste being the shell, with a black bean, chocolate, and cinnamon filling. The rellenito is then fried in a pan with oil until golden brown on all sides. They are generally served with either honey or powdered sugar on top.|$|E
50|$|When making buko pie {{a double}} baking method is followed. The pie crust and the pie filling {{need to be}} {{prepared}} separately before combining the two together. First the pie crust is made by mixing flour, salt and sugar in a bowl. Afterwards, the mixture is made into dough by adding and mixing in ice water and egg yolks. The dough mixture is then refrigerated and thinly rolled out by using a rolling pin. To finish the crust component of the buko pie, the dough is baked <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> cool. Next, the pie filling is prepared. The pie filling ingredients listed above are mixed and cooked on low heat. Once the pie crust and the pie filling are finished, they are combined together by pouring the filling into the pie crust. A second crust is used to cover the filling and seal the pie from all sides. It is then baked a second time until the crust is lightly browned.|$|E

Highlighting the potential of organizational economics, the analysis suggests that agri-environmental research and policy go further in accounting for, and investigating, the unique organizational modes of exchange governing the production of food, fiber, and ecological goods and services.

50|$|The Red Rock Lakes Wilderness {{is within}} the Red Rock Lakes National Wildlife Refuge in {{southwest}} Montana, United States. The wilderness occupies more than three fourths of the refuge <b>and</b> was <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> enhance species preservation, especially for such waterfowl as the trumpeter swan. By the mid-1930s, there were an estimated 69 trumpeter swans remaining in the lower 48 states {{and more than half}} of them were found in the region that is now the wilderness. The creation of the Wildlife Refuge marks one of the earliest attempts to ensure protection for a fast disappearing species and the wilderness designation enhances this habitat's protection status.|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to predict the distribution of mesophotic hard corals in the Au‘au Channel in the Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI). Mesophotic hard corals are light-dependent corals adapted to the low light conditions at approximately 30 to 150 m in depth. Several physical factors potentially influence their spatial distribution, including aragonite saturation, alkalinity, pH, currents, water temperature, hard substrate availability and the availability of light at depth. Mesophotic corals and mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) have increasingly been the subject of scientific study because they are being threatened by a growing number of anthropogenic stressors. They are the focus of this spatial modeling effort because the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary (HIHWNMS) is exploring the expansion of its scope—beyond the protection of the North Pacific Humpback Whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) —to include the conservation and management of these ecosystem components. The present study helps to address this need by examining the distribution of mesophotic corals in the Au‘au Channel region. This area is located between the islands of Maui, Lanai, Molokai and Kahoolawe, and includes parts of the Kealaikahiki, Alalākeiki and Kalohi Channels. It is unique, not only in terms of its geology, but also in terms of its physical oceanography and local weather patterns. Several physical conditions make it an ideal place for mesophotic hard corals, including consistently good water quality and clarity because it is flushed by tidal currents semi-diurnally; it has low amounts of rainfall and sediment run-off from the nearby land; and it is largely protected from seasonally strong wind and wave energy. Combined, these oceanographic and weather conditions create patches of comparatively warm, calm, clear waters that remain relatively stable through time. Freely available Maximum Entropy modeling software (MaxEnt 3. 3. 3 e) was used to create four separate maps of predicted habitat suitability for: (1) all mesophotic hard corals combined, (2) Leptoseris, (3) Montipora and (4) Porites genera. MaxEnt works by analyzing the distribution of environmental variables where species are present, so it can find other areas that meet all of the same environmental constraints. Several steps (Figure 0. 1) were required to produce and validate four ensemble predictive models (i. e., models with 10 replicates each). Approximately 2, 000 georeferenced records containing information about mesophotic coral occurrence and 34 environmental predictors describing the seafloor’s depth, vertical structure, available light, surface temperature, currents and distance from shoreline at three spatial scales were used to train MaxEnt. Fifty percent of the 1, 989 records were randomly chosen <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> assess each model replicate’s performance using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), Area Under the Curve (AUC) values. An additional 1, 646 records were also randomly chosen <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> independently assess the predictive accuracy of the four ensemble models. Suitability thresholds for these models (denoting where corals were predicted to be present/absent) were chosen by finding where the maximum number of correctly predicted presence and absence records intersected on each ROC curve. Permutation importance and jackknife analysis were used to quantify the contribution of each environmental variable to the four ensemble models...|$|E
40|$|The skin {{epidermis}} develops from {{a single}} uniform layer of multipotent cells during embryogenesis. Morphogenesis of hair follicles is initiated when a series of reciprocal interactions between this undifferentiated ectoderm and its underlying mesenchyme leads to a localized invagination of epithelial cells. As hair follicle development proceeds, stem cells are specified <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> fuel the postnatal hair cycle and repair the epidermis after injury. Although many signaling pathways have been identified by genetic studies to be essential for the induction of hair follicle morphogenesis and differentiation, {{little is known about}} the downstream genetic targets and molecular mechanisms in specifying a hair cell fate and establishing the stem cell niche. To define how the embryonic epithelium is able to integrate signals to direct, maintain, and regulate the hair cell lineage, I developed a strategy to isolate and transcriptionally profile embryonic hair progenitors and interfollicular epidermis in mice. This screen not only substantiated genes previously implicated in hair and epidermal development, but also uncovered genes that could be important in orchestrating lineage specification of multipotent skin progenitors. Many of these uncharacterized genes were also differentially expressed in the stem cells of postnatal hair follicles, suggesting that embryonic hair progenitors may directly give rise to and reflect functional attributes of adult stem cells. To test this premise, I evaluated the role of transcription factor Lhx 2 in skin development. Expressed specifically by both embryonic hair progenitors and postnatal follicle stem cells, Lhx 2 functions to establish hair follicle stem cells and maintain their undifferentiated, quiescent state. Loss of Lhx 2 reduces hair follicle number and causes stem cells to precociously differentiate, whereas gain of Lhx 2 inhibits differentiation and promotes a hair follicle stem cell fate. Thus, Lhx 2 appears to be a molecular link between the specification of embryonic hair progenitors and adult multipotent stem cells. Further characterization into genes that regulate hair follicle morphogenesis is expected to expand our understanding of how stem cells are established and maintained, and the potential mechanisms by which they are disrupted in skin disease...|$|E
