5|$|Because postmortem fetal {{extrusion}} is so rare, and occurs under highly idiosyncratic conditions {{regarding the}} individual and the ambient environment, this phenomenon has not been studied for possible applications to forensic investigation. Even if the study of postmortem fetal extrusion could lead to improved investigative methods, experimental research would be highly problematic. At present, forensic scientists have <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>disposal</b> an array of established techniques and procedures for a death investigation at the stages of decomposition when postmortem fetal extrusion typically occurs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The move {{to begin}} to place {{liabilities}} for copyright violations on internet intermediaries such as ISPs and Cyber Cafes {{as a result of}} contents allowed through their networks is a welcome development in the fight against copyright violations and piracy of digital contents. Beyond this however, experts must also realize that consumers of content have unguided opportunities to exploit digital content for undue gains once placed <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>disposals.</b> This is particularly possible {{as a result of the}} intrinsic properties of digital contents when compared to analog contents such as newspapers and transmissions from satellite cable stations. For example, multiple replications of digital contents can be carried out in the comfort of a client’s home using modern technologies such as CD-R/W or burners without degradation in quality.

5|$|One {{month after}} Croatia {{declared}} its independence, the Yugoslav army and other Serb forces held {{something less than}} one-third of the Croatian territory, mostly in areas with a predominantly ethnic Serb population. The JNA military strategy partly consisted of extensive shelling, at times irrespective of the presence of civilians. As the war progressed, the cities of Dubrovnik, Gospić, Šibenik, Zadar, Karlovac, Sisak, Slavonski Brod, Osijek, Vinkovci, and Vukovar all came under attack by Yugoslav forces. The United Nations (UN) imposed a weapons embargo; this did not affect JNA-backed Serb forces significantly, as they had the JNA arsenal <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>disposal,</b> but it caused serious trouble for the newly formed Croatian army. The Croatian government started smuggling weapons over its borders.|$|E
5|$|The rank of {{each person}} was {{determined}} by how many divine generals they had <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>disposal,</b> and {{by the number of}} divine scriptures they had obtained.

A person received their first general at the age of six years, and in subsequent ceremonies would be given more and generals and achieve a higher ranking until a full complement was achieved at the age of nineteen. Marriage would unite two sets of generals, thus giving a couple use of 150 divine generals. After marriage, further increases in ranking could only be achieved by religious achievement.|$|E

40|$|Many {{organizations}} {{have recognized that}} knowledge {{is the most important}} resource in today’s economy. Propelled by the resource- and knowledge-based views of the firm, organizations are actively embracing knowledge management with the expectation of acquiring and maintaining high levels of organizational performance. However, because knowledge management as a formal practice {{is still in its infancy}} and not yet well understood, many organizations are unable to attain expected performance. To help organizations, management consultants and academicians are proposing various knowledge management strategies. Despite the proliferation of strategies, to date, there have been little or no large-scale empirical studies to demonstrate the relationship between various knowledge management strategies and organizational performance. With limited resources <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>disposals,</b> organizations need to know and implement only those strategies that are more beneficial to them. This paper presents the first part of our efforts to study the relationships between knowledge management strategies and organizational performance. We discuss the strategies available to organizations, and elaborate on a model for an empirical test of Michael Earl’s Taxonomy of knowledge management strategies. Earl’s taxonomy has been selected because it encompasses most of the other strategies we identified in the literature. Our model hypothesizes how elements of the taxonomy and a number of organizational- and environmental-related factors relate to organizational performance. Understanding these relationships is essential for managers if they hope to improve performance through knowledge management...|$|R

50|$|This, {{in plain}} language, {{is how we}} deal with the aborigines: On occupying new {{territory}} the aboriginal inhabitants are treated exactly {{in the same way as}} the wild beasts or birds the settlers may find there.

5|$|British ships did not {{participate}} in any major wars in the ironclad period. The Royal Navy's ironclads only saw action as part of colonial battles or one-sided engagements like the bombardment of Alexandria in 1882. Defending British interests against Ahmed 'Urabi's Egyptian revolt, a British fleet opened fire on the fortifications around the port of Alexandria. A mixture of centre-battery and turret ships bombarded Egyptian positions for most of a day, forcing the Egyptians to retreat; return fire from Egyptian guns was heavy at first, but inflicted little damage, killing only five British sailors. Few Egyptian guns were actually dismounted, on the other hand, and the fortifications themselves were typically left intact. Had the Egyptians actually utilised the heavy mortars that were <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>disposal,</b> they might have quickly turned the tide, for the attacking British ironclads found it easy (for accuracy's sake) to simply anchor whilst firing—perfect targets for high-angle fire upon their thinly armored topdecks.|$|E

Founded in 1316 by John Salmon, Bishop of Norwich, the chapel, in addition to its role as a chantry dedicated to the souls of Salmon's parents and the predecessors and successors of the Bishops of Norwich had also been used as a charnel house and contained the Wodehouse chantry, founded by Henry V at the request of John Wodehous, a veteran of the Battle of Agincourt. The school moved to the site in the summer of 1551, where it has remained ever since. The chapel was used as the main schoolroom while the other buildings were used to provide a library and accommodation for the master and boarding pupils. The arrangement continued until the 19th century, and today the building is used as the school chapel.|$|E
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of 2 April, a five-hour meeting of local political leaders took place in Kupres, {{at the request of}} JNA. The purpose of the meeting, attended by members of Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Biljana Plavšić and Franjo Boras, was to defuse the situation. While there was an agreement to establish an ethnically balanced police force in Kupres and remove the roadblocks, the opposing sides could not agree {{on the role of the}} JNA. The Bosnian Serbs wanted the JNA to deploy to Kupres itself to ensure their protection, while the Bosnian Croats and Bosniaks wanted it to leave. During that same day, the 30th Partisan Division ordered the forces under its command, as well as the recent reinforcements, to capture Kupres and Kupreška Vrata and then hold their ground against anticipated Croatian counterattacks. Bosnian Croat authorities ordered the mobilisation of TO units in the nearby towns of Tomislavgrad and Posušje, with an armoured force <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>disposal</b> consisting of two T-55 tanks, two M36 tank destroyers, and one BVP M-80 infantry fighting vehicle.|$|E

5|$|Puffins {{have been}} hunted by man since time immemorial. Coastal {{communities}} and island dwellers with few natural resources <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>disposal,</b> made {{good use of}} the seafoods that they found on their cliffs and shores. Puffins were caught and eaten fresh, salted in brine or smoked and dried. Their feathers were used in bedding and their eggs were eaten, {{but not to the}} same extent as those of some other seabirds, being more difficult to extract from the nest. In most countries, Atlantic puffins are now protected by legislation, and in the countries where hunting is still permitted, strict laws prevent over-exploitation. They are still caught and eaten in Iceland and the Faroe Islands, but there have been calls for an outright ban on hunting them in Iceland because of concern over the dwindling number of birds successfully raising chicks.|$|E

Threatened by royal forces under Stanisław Żółkiewski, the confederates entered into an agreement with Sigismund, but then backed {{out of it and}} demanded the King's deposition. The ensuing civil war was resolved at the Battle of Guzów, where the szlachta was defeated in 1607. Afterwards however magnate leaders of the pro-King faction made sure that Sigismund's position would remain precarious, leaving arbitration powers within the Senate's competence. Whatever was left of the execution movement had become thwarted together with the obstructionist szlachta elements, and a compromise solution to the crisis of authority was arrived at.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of excess control rights of the {{ultimate}} controlling shareholder on the management of corporate cash holdings. The results show that firms {{are more inclined to}} build up large cash reserves when the control rights of the ultimate controlling shareholder exceed its cash-flow ownership. Additional analysis suggests that cash flow sensitivity of cash −when corporate insiders have larger excess control rights − originates from severe agency problems that occur in these firms rather than from the financial constraints they face or from a precautionary savings behavior. These findings provide empirical support to the argument that firms experiencing excess control rights accumulate cash to foster the entrenchment of their controlling shareholders and to facilitate their extraction of private benefits using the cash <b>at</b> <b>their</b> free <b>disposal...</b>|$|R
500|$|Emperors {{responded to}} the {{increased}} insecurity with a steady build-up of the forces <b>at</b> <b>their</b> immediate <b>disposal.</b> These {{became known as the}} comitatus ("escort", from which derives the English word [...] "committee"). To the Praetorian Guard's 10,000 men, Septimius Severus added the legion II Parthica. Based at Albano Laziale near Rome, it was the first legion to be stationed in Italy since Augustus. He doubled the size of the imperial escort cavalry, the equites singulares Augusti, to 2,000 by drawing select detachments from alae on the borders. His comitatus thus numbered some 17,000 men, equivalent to 31 infantry cohortes and 11 alae of cavalry. The trend for the emperor to gather round his person ever greater forces reached its peak in the 4th century under Constantine I the Great (ruled 312–37) whose comitatus may have reached 100,000 men, perhaps a quarter of the army's total effective strength.|$|R

Much research on mobility among seniors has concerned older age-groups than the one that is in focus in our study [10 – 13]. Urban residents who have only recently retired nuance the picture of older people’s mobility for at least three reasons: first, they are at an age when most people do not experience health decline, second, they have close access to shops and services and, third, they are in a stage of life with increased free time <b>at</b> <b>their</b> own <b>disposal.</b>|$|R
