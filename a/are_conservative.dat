5|$|In his Cronica, Villani {{writes that}} the Guelph defeat by the Ghibellines at Montaperti in 1260 was a major setback to the {{historical}} progress of the Republic of Florence. In this civil war, the Guelphs were a faction united with the papacy in Rome, while the Ghibellines were allied with the descendants of Emperor Frederick II of the Holy Roman Empire and supported by Siena. According to Villani, the Florentine Guelphs' last stand was in defending the Carroccio, a chariot which symbolized {{the independence of the}} Commune of Florence. Villani estimated that 2,500 Florentine troops were killed and 1,500 captured during the battle, which Roberta J.M. Olson states <b>are</b> <b>conservative</b> numbers in regards to subsequent historians writing of the battle's casualties.|$|E

25|$|The town is {{represented}} in parliament through the Aldershot constituency. The current MP is Gerald Howarth (Conservative), with a majority in May 2015 of 14,901 (32.1%). Of the 39 councillors on Rushmoor Borough Council, 18 represent the six wards that cover Aldershot. Of these councillors elected since the last local elections in May 2015, ten <b>are</b> <b>Conservative</b> and eight are Labour.|$|E
25|$|Because the geology of the {{subsurface}} {{cannot be}} examined directly, indirect techniques {{must be used}} to estimate the size and recoverability of the resource. While new technologies have increased the accuracy of these techniques, significant uncertainties still remain. In general, most early estimates of the reserves of an oil field <b>are</b> <b>conservative</b> and tend to grow with time. This phenomenon is called reserves growth.|$|E

25|$|Over 70% {{identify}} themselves as Catholic with significant minorities as Protestant or Evangelical. Another significant minority are those who practice the Jewish faith. Many of these claim ancestry from Sephardi Jews who came to New Spain in the 16th century to escape the Inquisition in Spain. When it reached New Spain, these people moved to the rural hills to continue their practice clandestinely. These are mostly concentrated {{in the community of}} Venta Prieta. While their claims have not been proven, there are indications that they are true. Most practitioners in Venta Prieta <b>are</b> <b>Conservative.</b>|$|E
25|$|Poynton is {{represented}} on Cheshire East Council in two two-member electoral wards called Poynton West, and Poynton East and Adlington by four councillors, {{all members of}} the Conservative Party. Cheshire East Council has 82 councillors in 52 wards, of whom 50 <b>are</b> <b>Conservative,</b> 14 are Labour, 4 are Liberal Democrats and 14 others. For the United Kingdom Parliament Poynton is in the Macclesfield Constituency which in 2009 was represented by Sir Nicholas Winterton, a Conservative. In 2010, David Rutley, a Conservative was elected after Sir Nicholas Winterton retired.|$|E
25|$|The Reformed Churches (Liberated) <b>are</b> <b>conservative</b> in {{doctrine}} and practice. They {{do not allow}} women to hold special offices (elders, deacons, pastors), but in the 1990s they did approve women voting in church elections. They reject so-called Higher Criticism of the Bible. Liturgically, they favour {{the use of the}} Genevan Psalter in their worship services, although in the last decade a number of classical hymns has also been approved for use in the worship service. In recent years evangelical influences have become stronger (e.g. a more contemporary style of the worship, including new songs and hymns and the use of a praise band). A minority of the members and ministers are questioning some traditional doctrines, and are asking for a different approach on issues like the ordination of women, homosexual relationships, etc. A large middle group, however, wants to hold on to classical Calvinism.|$|E

25|$|A hyperelastic {{material}} {{is a special}} case of a Cauchy elastic material in which the stress at any point is objective and determined only by {{the current state of}} deformation with respect to an arbitrary reference configuration (for more details on deformation see also the pages Deformation (mechanics) and Finite strain). However, the work done by the stresses may depend on the path the deformation takes. Therefore, a Cauchy elastic material has a non-conservative structure, and the stress cannot be derived from a scalar elastic potential function. The special case of Cauchy elastic materials where the work done by the stresses is independent of the path of deformation is referred to as a Green elastic or hyperelastic material. Such materials <b>are</b> <b>conservative</b> and the stresses in the material can be derived by a scalar elastic potential, more commonly known as the Strain energy density function.|$|E
25|$|Courtship and {{relationships}} in the Philippines <b>are</b> <b>conservative</b> in nature. The man will have to court the woman and prove his love for her before he can win her heart. Sometimes the courtship period would last for years; this however, is a very old fashioned idea. In the bigger more urbanized cities, this conservative courtship idea is not so emphasized as much. Parents prefer their daughter to be courted in theirhome, so {{they can have a}} chance to know the man. It is during the courtship period that the man would put his best foot forward to create a good impression on the woman and her family. Generally, the man is being measured on his being a gentleman, ability to respect the woman's family, and servitude (the extent of what he was willing to do to prove his love for the woman). Usually, the woman is courted by several men and will have to choose the best from among her suitors. Courtship {{and relationships}} remain the same for rural and urban areas despite the modern western influence.|$|E
25|$|In any {{community}} of scientists, Kuhn states, {{there are some}} individuals who are bolder than most. These scientists, judging that a crisis exists, embark on what Kuhn calls revolutionary science, exploring alternatives to long-held, obvious-seeming assumptions. Occasionally this generates a rival to the established framework of thought. The new candidate paradigm will appear {{to be accompanied by}} numerous anomalies, partly because it is still so new and incomplete. The majority of the scientific community will oppose any conceptual change, and, Kuhn emphasizes, so they should. To fulfill its potential, a scientific community needs to contain both individuals who are bold and individuals who <b>are</b> <b>conservative.</b> There are many examples in the history of science in which confidence in the established frame of thought was eventually vindicated. It is almost impossible to predict whether the anomalies in a candidate for a new paradigm will eventually be resolved. Those scientists who possess an exceptional ability to recognize a theory's potential will be the first whose preference is likely to shift in favour of the challenging paradigm. There typically follows a period in which there are adherents of both paradigms. In time, if the challenging paradigm is solidified and unified, it will replace the old paradigm, and a paradigm shift will have occurred.|$|E

500|$|Yuri on Ice has {{highlighted}} homophobia {{in figure}} skating and other areas; the seventh episode features a flashback {{in which a}} younger Victor performs in a costume based on those worn by openly-gay figure skater Johnny Weir, who was subject to homophobic comments throughout his career. Weir {{said in an interview}} with The Geekiary, [...] "I think all positive imagery of LGBT themes in sport are good. Unfortunately, the majority of people that rule the skating world <b>are</b> <b>conservative</b> and more business minded. I think many of them, while they may love and appreciate the art and the sport, are more interested in the business side of things or power trips. I don't know if Yuri on Ice will be able to change the perception of gay athletes to a 60 year old businessman, but I am of the school of thought that every little bit helps". The series finale features a scene in which Yuri K. and Victor skate together at an exhibition event; something which has not yet occurred in actual competition. Critics have noted that the series depicts two characters from countries with problems concerning LGBT rights.|$|E
500|$|Jean has himself {{admitted}} {{in an interview}} that The Simpsons is of [...] "liberal bent". In the DVD commentaries, creator Matt Groening and the majority of people who work on the show state several times that they are very liberal, but some, such as John Swartzwelder (the writer of this and many other The Simpsons episodes), <b>are</b> <b>conservative.</b> In his book The Really Inconvenient Truths: Seven Environmental Catastrophes Liberals Don't Want You to Know About- Because They Helped Cause Them, Iain Murray described [...] "The Frying Game" [...] as [...] "subversively conservative", and wrote that it shows [...] "The best popular explanation of the liberal environmentalist model for endangered species." [...] In the episode, Homer buys a koi pond for Marge, only to find a screamapillar has taken residence in their garden. When Homer tries to squash it, an EPA official tells him that allowing an endangered species to die is a federal offense, under the [...] "Reversal of Freedoms Act of 1994." [...] Homer is forced to coddle the screamapillar, and when he accidentally squashes it, Homer is found guilty of [...] "attempted insecticide and aggravated buggery." [...] The [...] "Reversal of Freedoms Act" [...] is a reference to the Endangered Species Act, an environmental law that Murray opined had [...] "indeed become the Reversal of Freedoms Act." [...] He continued, [...] "Landowners who happened to have threatened or endangered species on their lands or who simply have habitat that might be used by endangered species are routinely prevented from using their lands or property. They are stopped from undertaking such activities as harvesting their trees, grazing their cattle, irrigating their fields, clearing brush along fence lines, disking firebreaks around their homes and barns, or building new homes.|$|E
