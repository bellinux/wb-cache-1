500|$|This was a Team {{of history}} makers. Torah Bright became Australia's most {{successful}} female Winter Olympian {{by adding a}} silver medal to her gold from Vancouver in 2010. In Sochi, Bright was the only athlete to attempt three Snowboard events at the one Olympics: Slopestyle, Halfpipe and Snowboard Cross. David Morris, Australia’s only male <b>Aerialist</b> at the Sochi Games wrote his own piece of Olympic history by completing a double-full full-full (quad twisting somersault) in the men’s Freestyle Skiing – Aerials super-final. Morris scored 110.41 points for his jump and was awarded the silver medal. He was later honoured for his achievement by carrying the Australian flag in the Closing Ceremony. Aerials teammate and defending Olympic Aerial Skiing Champion Lydia Lassila was in Sochi to make history. Lydia chose to execute a jump in the women’s super-final that no other woman {{in the history of}} the sport had attempted in competition, a quad twisting triple somersault. The high degree of difficulty jump scored her 72.12 points and the bronze medal. This historical effort has taken the sport of women’s Aerials to a whole new level. Lassila is also the first mother to win a Winter Olympic medal for Australia. [...] Bobsleigh’s Jana Pittman became the first female Olympian to compete in both a Summer and Winter Olympics. Callum and Aimee Watson became the first siblings to compete at the same Games in Cross Country. Alex Almoukov pulled off the best ever performance by a male Australian biathlete when he finished 45th in the 20km Individual.

[...] He even executed a skillful transition from a moving airplane, via a long rope that dangled below, to the ground, and was purportedly the first to ever attempt the stunt. [...] According to the recollections of an area local, Parcaut once jumped out of a plane wearing a [...] "batman" [...] costume as a stunt over Spencer, Iowa, {{in the early}} 1930s. [...] Sometime around 1932, while performing a barnstorming exhibition at Boone, Iowa, the biplane from which he was performing suddenly lost engine power and plummeted over 1,000 feet to the ground, crashing in a farmer's field. [...] Parcaut survived the crash, likely due to his extremely good physical condition, but was severely injured. [...] The aircraft itself was utterly destroyed in the wreck and was a complete loss. [...] Due to the nature of his injuries, [...] "he lost much of his speed and was never prominent as a wrestler again." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{chimney swift}} is a [...] species, and is seldom seen alone. It {{generally}} hunts {{in groups of}} two or three, migrates in loose flocks of 6–20, and (once the breeding season is over) sleeps in huge communal roosts of {{hundreds or thousands of}} birds. Like all swifts, it is a superb <b>aerialist,</b> and only rarely seen at rest. It drinks on the wing, skimming {{the surface of the water}} with its beak. It also bathes on the wing, gliding above the surface of a body of water, briefly smacking its breast into the water, then flying off again, shaking its feathers as it goes. It has been recorded by pilots flying more than a mile above the surface of the earth, including one seen at [...] It is incapable of perching upright like most birds do; instead, it clings to vertical surfaces. If it is disturbed while at rest, the chimney swift will clap its wings loudly once or twice against its body; it does this either in place, or while dropping down several feet to a lower location. This behavior can result in a loud [...] "thundering" [...] sound if large roosts of the birds are disturbed. The sound is thought to be the bird's way of scaring away potential predators.|$|E

40|$|Female solo <b>aerialists</b> of the 1920 s {{and early}} 1930 s were internationally popular {{performers}} {{in the largest}} live mass entertainment of the period in the UK and USA. Yet these <b>aerialists</b> and this period in circus history have been largely forgotten by scholars. I address this omission by arguing these stars should be remembered for how they contributed to strength being incorporated into some stereotypes of femininity. Analysing in detail Lillian Leitzel, Luisita Leers and, {{to a lesser extent}} the Flying Codonas, I employ a cross-disciplinary methodology unique to aerial scholarship that uses embodied understanding to reinvigorate archival resources. This approach allows me to build on the wider scholarly histories of Peta Tait, drawing important conclusions about the form including how weightlessness is constructed and risk is performed. In the introduction I re-evaluate the nostalgic histories of circus to establish circus’ and aerialists’ popularity in this period, before exploring how engagements shaped careers. Chapter 1 considers the difference in experiencing <b>aerialists</b> in the USA and UK by bringing together previously unrelated data on circus, variety and vaudeville venues. <b>Aerialists</b> made good celebrities because their acts, located above audience members’ heads, challenged the conventional relationship between ticket prices and sightlines. Chapter 2 explores how the kinaesthetic fantasy evoked by experiencing aerial action created glamour and how glamour had the power to reframe femininity in the 1920 s. Glamour and celebrity have often been confused and Chapter 3 distinguishes the two before considering what characterises aerial celebrity. Reconfiguring Joseph Roach’s public intimacy as skilful vulnerability allows me to analyse how risk was gendered and performed in relationship to skill. The gendering of risk leads me to consider what in society contributed to aerial stardom by drawing upon Richard Dyer’s argument that celebrities embody a cultural ambiguity. Female <b>aerialists</b> reframed their femininity in a similar way to women who aspired to the modern girl stereotype in wider society. In the final chapter I expand on the activity of the modern girl, comparing strategies used by young exercising women to female <b>aerialists.</b> This enables me to draw conclusions about how witnessing these stars tapped into national ideas of citizenship, and to designate <b>aerialists</b> as the first to use the power of glamour to make muscular femininity acceptable.
