50|$|Charlie rescued {{his father}} from the wreckage, but Charlie’s younger brother, Teddy, {{along with the}} pilot and flight <b>attendant</b> on <b>board</b> were killed.|$|R
5000|$|Madeline Amy Sweeney, {{was also}} a flight <b>attendant</b> on <b>board</b> Flight 11, Sweeney {{was the first to}} {{describe}} the hijackers, and their actions.|$|R
50|$|Comedian {{and actor}} Anthony Steven Kalloniatis {{was working as}} a flight <b>attendant</b> on <b>board</b> at the time and has {{referenced}} this crash in his stand up.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the nine flight <b>attendants</b> on <b>board,</b> there were five additional off-duty flight attendants who assisted in the evacuation. Although only three of eight exit doors were available for use, the evacuation was completed within two minutes.|$|R
5000|$|Betty Ong, was {{a flight}} <b>attendant</b> on <b>board</b> American Airlines Flight 11 {{the first of}} four hijacked aircraft's on the morning of September 11, 2001. Ong is best known for her actions that morning as well as her calm and {{professional}} manner.|$|R
25|$|Flight attendants {{were paid}} $9 per flight hour, {{and were not}} paid a per diem. While this was {{considerably}} lower than competing airlines' wages, flight attendants also received 10% of all sales made during the flight, splitting all commissions evenly among all flight <b>attendants</b> on <b>board.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was flying from Pokhara Airport to Jomsom Airport on an unscheduled flight. There were eighteen passengers, two pilots and a flight <b>attendant</b> on <b>board.</b> At 09:30 local time (03:45 UTC), the aircraft attempted {{to land at}} Jomson, but the first attempt was aborted by the pilots. During the subsequent go-around, one of the aircraft's wings impacted a hill, causing the aircraft to crash.|$|R
50|$|A call button, that, when pressed, alerts an <b>{{attendant}}</b> on <b>board</b> {{to serve}} the passenger(s)in the row with the pressed button (the attendant is directed by a small light on the console and alerted by a quiet audio signal). As with the reading light buttons, the call button is usually located directly on the overhead console on most narrowbody aircraft, while they are found together with IFE controls on most widebody aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The role of {{a flight}} {{attendant}} derives from that of similar positions on passenger ships or passenger trains, but it has more direct involvement with passengers because of the confined quarters on aircraft. Additionally, {{the job of a}} flight attendant revolves around safety to a much greater extent than those of similar staff on other forms of transportation. Flight <b>attendants</b> on <b>board</b> a flight collectively form a cabin crew, as distinguished from pilots and engineers in the cockpit.|$|R
50|$|On {{arrival at}} Philadelphia International Airport, the pilots tried {{to land the}} {{aircraft}} too far down the runway, instead of aborting the approach. The runway was icy; the aircraft over-shot, running through a fence and into a ditch. The left wing broke off, rupturing the gasoline tanks, and the airplane caught fire. Of 28 people on board, including 3 crew, 7 were killed, including two infants and the one flight <b>attendant</b> on <b>board.</b> It is the only fatal aviation accident at the airport.|$|R
5000|$|... 10 September 2008: A flight <b>attendant</b> on <b>board</b> Air Arabia flight 522 {{bound for}} Shah Amanat International Airport, Chittagong found a note which {{said there was}} a bomb on board the {{aircraft}} (an Airbus A320). After the aircraft landed in Chittagong, the aircraft was searched but no bomb was found. A passenger on board the flight named Nasir Uddin was found guilty of the hoax, which caused panic among passengers and had grounded the aircraft at Chittagong for two hours.|$|R
5000|$|A humorous {{music video}} {{was made in}} which the band espy two female flight <b>attendants</b> and {{illegally}} <b>board</b> the aeroplane they are travelling on.

5|$|CeeCee Lyles {{was one of}} {{the flight}} <b>attendants</b> on <b>board.</b> In 2003, a statue of Lyles was {{unveiled}} in her hometown of Fort Pierce, Florida, which has since gained national recognition as one of the many monuments to the attacks. On August 9, 2007, a portion of U.S.219 in Somerset County, near the Flight 93 National Memorial, was co-signed as the Flight 93 Memorial Highway. At the National September 11 Memorial, the names of the 40 victims of Flight 93 are inscribed on Panels S-67 and S-68 at the South Pool.|$|R
25|$|On 8 April 1968, BOAC Flight 712 Boeing 707 G-ARWE, departing for Australia via Singapore, {{suffered}} an engine fire just after take-off. The engine {{fell from the}} wing into a nearby gravel pit in Staines, before the plane managed to perform an emergency landing with the wing on fire. However, the plane was consumed by fire once on the ground. Five people – four passengers and a stewardess – died, while 122 survived. Barbara Harrison, a flight <b>attendant</b> on <b>board</b> who helped with the evacuation, was posthumously awarded the George Cross.|$|R

50|$|Without a {{coat and}} in cowboy boots, the hijacker bailed out from the lower aft door over the {{treeless}} plains of northeastern Colorado in mid-afternoon. He was apprehended a few hours later, with minor injuries and very cold. The plane, with two pilots and a flight <b>attendant</b> on <b>board,</b> landed safely at Denver's Stapleton airport at 2:55 p.m. MST. Facing potential death penalty charges for air piracy, the Vietnam veteran, a former U.S. Army paratrooper, was sentenced to forty years, but served less than eight and was released from a halfway house in 1979. He died at age sixty in New Hampshire in 2008.|$|R

6000|$|There {{was a great}} theater, or platform, {{erected in}} front of the altar in the church, which was thronged by the {{concourse}} of spectators who rushed to witness the ceremony. The beautiful princess was married by proxy to a man in another kingdom, whom she had never seen, or, at least, never known. It is not probable that she observed him at the time when he was, for one evening, in her presence, on his journey through Paris. The Duke of Buckingham had been sent over by Charles to conduct home his bride. Ships were waiting at Boulogne, a port nearly opposite to Dover, to take her and her <b>attendants</b> on <b>board.</b> She bade farewell to the palaces of Paris, and set out on her journey.[D] ...|$|R

She resides with her family in Los Angeles, CA.|$|R
5000|$|From about 1890 to 1960, {{shipping}} live {{chickens and}} other birds by rail in special [...] "henhouses on wheels" [...] was commonplace. The cars featured wire mesh sides (which {{were covered with}} cloth in the winter to protect the occupants) and a multi-level series of individual coops, each one fitted with feed and water troughs. An <b>attendant</b> traveled on <b>board</b> in a central compartment to feed and water the animals. The cars were also equipped with a coal stove that provided heat for {{the center of the}} car.|$|R
500|$|On 26 May 2015, EVA Air flight BR12 (Boeing 777-300ER B-16718, Delivered May 2014) from Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport to Los Angeles landed safely at Los Angeles International Airport at 15:40 (3:40 pm).

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} was to survey former participants (n= 869) of a cadaver workshop using a mail questionnaire to assess the demographic data {{and the impact of}} these courses on daily practice. The deadline for acceptance of return mail was 60 days. Descriptive statistics were employed for analysis of results. The response rate was 36. 7 % and the course was judged to be recommendable by 98. 2 %. The average course <b>attendant</b> was <b>board</b> certified and had spent a mean time of 9 +/- 6 years in anesthesiology. The highest quality and degree of subsequent practicability in daily routine was attributed to peripheral nerve block training on cadavers. Of the course participants two-thirds performed regional anesthesia procedures more often following attendance. The majority of course attendants had to defray at least a part of the course fee themselves, and one-third was required to invest leisure time to attend. Attendance of a cadaver workshop increased knowledge of clinical anatomy and enhanced performance of regional anesthesia procedures. Courses of this format constitute a currently underestimated adjunct to contemporary regional anesthesia educatio...|$|R
60|$|Not {{a moment}} {{was to be}} lost. Lady Cecily had with her, at this time, her two {{youngest}} sons, George and Richard. She made immediate arrangements for her flight. It happened that the Earl of Warwick, who was at this time the Lord High Admiral, and who, of course, had command of the seas between England and the Continent, was a relative and friend of Lady Cecily's. He was {{at this time in}} London. Lady Cecily applied to him to assist her in making her escape. He consented, and, with his aid, she herself, with her two children and a small number of attendants, escaped secretly from London, and {{made their way to the}} southern coast. There Lady Cecily put the children and the <b>attendants</b> on <b>board</b> a vessel, by which they were conveyed to the coast of Holland. On landing there, they were received by the prince of the country, who was a friend of Lady Cecily, and to whose care she commended them. The prince received them with great kindness, and sent them to the city of Utrecht, where he established them safely in one of his palaces, and appointed suitable tutors and governors to superintend their education. Here it was expected that they would remain for several years.|$|R

5000|$|On her website, Brockovich {{says the}} film is [...] "probably 98% accurate". While the general facts of the story are accurate, there are some minor {{discrepancies}} between actual events and the movie, {{as well as a}} number of controversial and disputed issues more fundamental to the case. In the film, Erin Brockovich appears to deliberately use her cleavage to seduce the water <b>board</b> <b>attendant</b> to allow her to access the documents. Brockovich has acknowledged that her cleavage may have had an influence, but denies consciously trying to influence individuals in this way. In the film, Ed Masry represents Erin Brockovich in the car crash case. In reality, it was his law partner, Jim Vititoe. Brockovich had never been Miss Wichita; she had been Miss Pacific Coast. According to Brockovich, this detail was deliberately changed by Soderbergh as he thought it was [...] "cute" [...] to have her be beauty queen of the region from which she came. The [...] "not so good employee" [...] that met Brockovich in the bar was Chuck Ebersohl. He told Erin about the documents that he and Lillian Melendez had been tasked by PG&E to destroy.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} first impacted {{with the}} underside of its rear fuselage and skidded about 800 m along runway 12L with its landing gear partly retracted as it rotated to the right about 120 degrees. As the aircraft skidded down the runway, the number 2 (starboard) engine detached and slid along the wing's leading edge toward the wingtip. Firefighting appliances were at the aircraft less than 90 seconds after it came to rest (which was 33 seconds after the initial impact) and started to fight fires at several locations as all 300 passengers and crew were safely evacuated. Video from inside the aircraft, taken on passengers' cellphone cameras, showed the passengers failing to evacuate, instead giving priority to carry-on luggage, resulting in an overly long evacuation and heavy criticism. [...] Nine minutes after the aircraft came to a stop, with only the aircraft captain and the senior flight <b>attendant</b> still on <b>board</b> (checking for any remaining passengers), {{there was a large}} explosion. The explosion, of the aircraft's center fuel tank, resulted in the death of a firefighter, a Ras al-Khaimah resident named Jasim Issa Mohammed Hasan. Twenty-four of the aircraft's occupants were injured [...] - [...] including the captain and the senior flight attendant, who evacuated after the explosion; the senior flight attendant was the only person among the passengers and crew seriously injured, suffering from smoke inhalation. In addition, eight firefighters and a policeman were injured, several of the firefighters suffering from heat stroke. The explosion resulted in the fire spreading to the aircraft's cabin; it took firefighters 16 hours to bring the fire under control. The airport was closed during and following the accident, which resulted in many diverted flights.|$|R
