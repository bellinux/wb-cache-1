25|$|An {{alternation}} not {{triggered by}} sound change was Sievers' law, which caused alternation of suffixal -j- and -ij- {{depending on the}} length of the preceding part of the morpheme. If preceded within the same morpheme by only short vowel followed by a single consonant, -j- appeared. In all other cases, such as when preceded by a long vowel or diphthong, by two or more consonants, or by more than one syllable, -ij- appeared. The distinction between morphemes and words is important here, as the <b>alternant</b> -j- appeared also in words that contained a distinct suffix that in turn contained -j- in its second syllable. A notable example was the verb suffix *-atjaną, which retained -j- despite being preceded by two syllables in a fully formed word.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} some selected {{cases of}} stressed vowel alternations arisen from {{the application of}} metaphony in Italo-Romance dialects. While similar cases are often reported in the literature, the ones picked up here stand out because they resist, for several reasons, any analysis treating metaphony as a synchronic phonological rule (albeit opacized), deriving the surface <b>alternants</b> from abstract underlying representations. Such analyses, as standardly practiced in the Generative paradigm from the 1960 s to this day, would face insurmountable problems in accounting for the morphological paradigms that capitalize on the metaphonic <b>alternants</b> putting them into service as exponents of morphosyntactic categories. Thus, the study of morphological complexity yields supporting evidence for phonological theories like Natural Phonology, which severely constrains the amount of abstractness permitted to underlying representations...|$|R

25|$|The {{loss of the}} Proto-Indo-European {{contrastive}} accent {{got rid of the}} conditioning {{environment for}} the consonant alternations created by Verner's law. Without this conditioning environment, the cause of the alternation was no longer obvious to native speakers. The alternations that had started as mere phonetic variants of sounds became increasingly grammatical in nature, leading to the grammatical alternations of sounds known as Grammatischer Wechsel. For a single word, the grammatical stem could display different consonants depending on its grammatical case or its tense. As a result of the complexity of this system, significant levelling of these sounds occurred throughout the Germanic period {{as well as in the}} later daughter languages. Already in Proto-Germanic, most alternations in nouns were leveled to have only one sound or the other consistently throughout all forms of a word, although some alternations were preserved, only to be levelled later in the daughters (but differently in each one). Alternations in noun and verb endings were also levelled, usually in favour of the voiced <b>alternants</b> in nouns, but a split remained in verbs where unsuffixed (strong) verbs received the voiced <b>alternants</b> while suffixed (weak) verbs had the voiceless <b>alternants.</b> Alternation between the present and past of strong verbs remained common and was not levelled in Proto-Germanic, and survives up to the present day in some Germanic languages.|$|R
