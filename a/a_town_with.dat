5|$|After the Battle of Edington in 878, Alfred {{established}} {{a network of}} fortified settlements, called burhs, in Wessex to protect his people and territory against Viking attacks, and when Æthelred accepted Alfred's lordship the burhs were extended into Mercia. One of the burhs was Worcester, where Æthelred worked with its bishop and used the standing Roman walls in the town's defences. Over the next two generations Worcester was transformed from an ecclesiastical settlement to <b>a</b> <b>town</b> <b>with</b> a diverse population of craftsmen.|$|E
5|$|Although {{not very}} much is known about Allen's childhood, the town of Cornwall was {{frontier}} territory in the 1740s. By the time Allen reached his teens, the area, while still a difficult area in which to make a living, began to resemble <b>a</b> <b>town,</b> <b>with</b> wood-frame houses beginning to replace the rough cabins of the early settlers. Joseph Allen died in 1755; {{at the time of}} his death he was one of the wealthier landowners in the area, ran a successful farm, and had previously served as town selectman. Allen had, before his father's death, begun studies under a minister in the nearby town of Salisbury with the goal of gaining admission to Yale College. Allen's brother Ira recalled that, even at a young age, Allen was curious and interested in learning.|$|E
5|$|In Montana, {{municipalities}} {{are divided}} into four classes by state statute based on their population. Members of the three largest classes are deemed cities, while {{the members of the}} fourth class are called towns. Cities and towns are classified {{at the time of their}} organization, and are reorganized when they change classification due to an increase or decrease in population. A place may incorporate as <b>a</b> <b>town</b> <b>with</b> the support of 300 electors or two-thirds of the registered electors. A municipality with a population between 1,000 and 5,000 people is a Third Class city. A municipality with a population between 5,000 and 10,000 people is a Second Class city. And a municipality with a population over 10,000 people is a First Class city. Under certain exceptions municipalities with a population of between 9,000 and 10,000 may elect by resolution to be either a First or Second Class city. Under similar exceptions municipalities with a population of between 5,000 and 7,500 may elect by resolution to be either a Second or Third Class city. Municipalities with a population of between 1,000 and 2,500 may by resolution be classified as either a town or Third Class city. Unincorporated places such as census-designated places fall outside this scheme, and are subject to county governance, and thus are not towns or cities.|$|E

5|$|The town lies on {{the ancient}} Watling Street, but is not {{recorded}} before the 17th century, although Ogley Hay, which in modern times is a district of the town, is recorded as a settlement in the Domesday Book. Brownhills quickly grew around the coal mining industry, especially after it became linked to the canal and railway networks in the mid-19th century, {{and by the end}} of the century had grown from a hamlet of only 300 inhabitants to <b>a</b> <b>town</b> <b>with</b> a population of over , of whom the vast majority were employed in the coal industry. Mining remained the town's principal industry until the 1950s, but the subsequent closure of the area's pits led to a severe economic decline which has continued until the present day. The local authority has instituted a regeneration programme which it is hoped will revive the town's fortunes, providing better transport and leisure facilities.|$|E
5|$|Shelley, {{who visited}} the toddler Allegra while she was being boarded with a family chosen by Byron, objected to the child's living {{arrangements}} over the years, though he had initially approved of Clairmont's plan to relinquish her to her father. During the summer of 1819, Allegra stayed with four different families and was abandoned by her nursemaid. Byron sent her to stay for long periods with his friend, British consul Richard Belgrave Hoppner, but Hoppner's wife didn't like Allegra and sent her to stay with three other families in as many months. Though he'd originally agreed to permit Clairmont to visit their daughter, Byron reneged on the agreement. Shelley often tried to persuade Byron to let Clairmont see her daughter and they thought of ways to regain custody of her. Clairmont was alarmed by reports in 1820 that her daughter had suffered a malarial-type fever and that Byron had moved her to warm Ravenna {{at the height of}} the summer. Clairmont wrote that Allegra must be moved to a more healthy climate if she was to survive and pleaded with Byron to send their daughter to her in Bagni di Lucca, <b>a</b> <b>town</b> <b>with</b> a cool mountain climate. However, Byron didn't want to send Allegra back to be raised in the Shelley household, where he was sure she'd grow ill from eating a vegetarian diet and would be taught atheism. He pointed out that all of the other children in the Shelley household had died: the Shelleys' first three children had all died young and their fourth child, Elena Adelaide Shelley, died in a foster home in 1820 at age seventeen months.|$|E
