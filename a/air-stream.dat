The stabilizing effect of steadily flowing <b>air-streams</b> injected into the vaneless region of a vane-island diffuser through the shroud surface is described. Parametric variations of injection angle, injection flow rate, number of injectors, injector spacing, and injection versus bleed were investigated for a range of impeller speeds and tip clearances.

The stabilizing effect of flow obstructions created by tubes that were inserted into the diffuser vaneless space through the shroud was also investigated. Tube immersion into the vaneless space was varied in the flow obstruction experiments. Results from testing done at impeller design speed and tip clearance are presented. Surge margin improved by 1. 7 points using injection air that was supplied from within the compressor.

40|$|A {{fumigation}} {{experiment was}} performed in which six plant species representing the European flora were exposed {{to a range of}} DBP concentrations. Controlled amounts of DBP-saturated air were injected into the ingoing <b>air-streams</b> of plant fumigation chambers, maintaining constant concentrations there for a period of up to 76 days. The target concentrations were a control, 0. 8, 1. 5, 3. 5, and 10. 0 µg m- 3. The variation in sensitivity between plant species to atmospheric DBP was quantified on the basis of whole plant biomass in order to derive no-observed-effect-concentrations (NOECs). Significant dose–response relationships, based on realised concentrations, were thus derived using non-linear regression, resulting in NOECs of 0. 51 µg m- 3 for Trifolium repens, 0. 96 µg m- 3 for Brassica campestris, 1. 87 µg m- 3 for Phaseolus vulgaris and 2. 21 µg m- 3 for Plantago major. A significant effect was also observed for Holcus lanatus at 12. 4 µg m- 3 DBP, but due to the variation at lower levels of DBP exposure, no dose–response relationship could be derived. No significant effect on growth of current year needles in Picea abies was observed, even at the highest level of DBP, 13. 7 µg m- 3. Based on statistical extrapolation according to Aldenberg and Slob [Ecotox. Environ. Safety, 25 (1993) 48], an overall predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) for the plant-atmosphere compartment of 0. 33 µg m- 3 DBP was calculated. The PNEC was calculated using the mean and standard deviation of the NOEC for four of the tested species and an extrapolation factor. In addition to changes in leaf colour, leaf crinkling and growth reduction, a number of not quantified observations are described, indicating that DBP affects the physiology as well as the morphology of these species...|$|R
40|$|Natural sea shells {{are used}} in the {{treatment}} of waste <b>air-streams</b> in biofitration process, however this industry requires new methods of fabricating synthetic shell media to perform in the way natural shell performs. This present study investigates the manufacturing of seashells-like bioceramic/biocomposites as a filter bed with optimum porosity and compressive load capacity using uniaxial die compaction method. According to the structure of natural sea shell, calcium carbonate bioceramics/biocomposites were designed and manufactured in three steps. In the first step, optimisation of the process parameters and their effects on the porosity (Pr) and compressive load (Cs) of bio-ceramic 1 have been studied. Statistical analyses of the data indicates that only the weight fraction of the pore former and the compaction load influenced significantly the porosity and the compressive load. The compaction speed has no significant influence on the properties of the artificial bioceramic. Higher weight fraction of pore former and lower compaction load leads to high porosity and low compressive load. In the second step, the effect of the particle size of the pore former on porosity and compressive load of calcium carbonate bioceramic 2 was investigated and optimised. The particle size of the pore former has a significant effect on compressive load. No substantial effect of the particle size of the pore former has been found to vary the porosity of the bioceamic 2. In the third step, the effect of the addition of biopolymers on compressive load of calcium carbonate biocomposite has been analysed. The mixing of individual or both biopolymers together increased the compressive load of the calcium carbonate biocomposites significantly. This new synthetic bioceramic/composites were also examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and their behaviour under compression test was also determined. Porosity and compressive load of the natural seashells were compared with artificial calcium carbonate bioceramic/biocomposites. The biocomposite performed well mechanically under dry conditions however more research is required to identify the problems that occurred under wet conditions...|$|R

5000|$|In 1962 and 1963 Oldsmobile built a {{turbocharged}} {{version of}} the 215. The small-diameter Garrett T5 turbocharger with integral wastegate was manufactured by Garrett AiResearch and produced a maximum of 5 psi (34 kPa) boost at 2200 rpm. The engine had 10.25:1 compression and a single-barrel carburetor. It was rated at [...] at 4600 rpm and [...] at 3200 rpm. In development, the high compression ratio combined with the charged load created problems with spark knock on hard throttle applications, which led Olds to develop and utilize a novel water-injection system that sprayed metered amounts of distilled water and methyl alcohol (dubbed [...] "Turbo-Rocket Fluid") into the intake manifold <b>air-stream</b> to cool the intake charge. If the fluid reservoir was empty, a complex double-float and valve assembly in the Turbo-Rocket Fluid path would set a second butterfly (positioned between the throttle butterfly and the turbocharger) into the closed position, limiting the amount of boost pressure. Unfortunately, many customers did not keep the reservoir filled, or had mechanical problems with the turbocharger system which resulted {{in many of the}} turbo-charger installations being removed and a conventional 4 barrel carburetor and manifold installed in its place.|$|E
5000|$|Accumulated heat is an {{important}} consideration {{in the operation of}} a compressor in an internal combustion engine. Of the three basic supercharger types, the Roots design historically possessed the worst thermal efficiency, especially at high pressure ratios. In accordance with the ideal gas law, a compression operation will raise the temperature of the compressed output. Additionally, the operation of the compressor itself requires energy input, which is converted to heat and can be transferred to the gas through the compressor housing, heating it more. Although intercoolers are more commonly known for their use on turbochargers, superchargers may also benefit from the use of an intercooler. Internal combustion is based upon a thermodynamic cycle, and a cooler temperature of the intake charge results in a greater thermodynamic expansion and vice versa. A hot intake charge provokes detonation in a petrol engine, and can melt the pistons in a diesel, while an intercooling stage adds complexity but can improve the power output by increasing the amount of the input charge, exactly as if the engine were of higher capacity. An intercooler reduces the thermodynamic efficiency by losing the heat (power) introduced by compression, but increases the power available because of the increased working mass for each cycle. Above about [...] the intercooling improvement can become dramatic. With a Roots-type supercharger, one method successfully employed is the addition of a thin heat exchanger placed between the blower and the engine. Water is circulated through it to a second unit placed near the front of the vehicle where a fan and the ambient <b>air-stream</b> can dissipate the collected heat.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} options for moving grain from one {{location}} to another. Some of these options include conveyors such as belt conveyors, drag conveyors, screw conveyors, and pneumatic conveyors. Belt conveyors cause the least damage to grain {{due to the}} lack of contact forces, however, they cannot be used for steep inclines. Another commonly used conveyor is screw conveyors. Screw conveyors, also known as augers, are conveyors made from a helical blade with rotational motion to move grain. They are on many types of farm equipment, including combines and grain carts for example. Augers generally have a high power requirements, but are portable and low cost. In addition, augers tend to cause high levels of mechanical damage to the grain. Much research has been completed to quantify the amount of grain damage caused by various screw conveyors. The percentage of grain damage is decreased when the auger is operated at capacity because the grain cannot bounce around and strike surfaces as easily. In addition, grain damage increases with increased rotational speed. For this research with screw conveyors, the angle of the incline was found to have no significant effect on the grain damage.Pneumatic conveyors use a moving <b>air-stream</b> to propel grain, and are used in situations when the path of the grain is complex. Grain damage can occur especially at any changes in the tube path, but can be minimized when air speeds are kept below 25 meters per second. [...] It is shown that grain damage increases exponentially above air velociities of 20 meters per second. [...] In research by Baker et al. breakage levels of maize in pneumatic conveyors were found to be similar to those of bucket or drag conveyors.|$|E
