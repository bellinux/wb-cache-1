500|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in August 1914, Ball enlisted in the British Army, joining the 2/7th (Robin Hood) Battalion of the Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment). Soon promoted to [...] sergeant, he gained his commission as a second lieutenant on 29 October. He was assigned to training recruits, but this rear-echelon role irked him. In an attempt to see action, he transferred early the following year to the North Midlands Cyclist Company, Divisional Mounted Troops, but remained confined to a posting in England. On 24 February 1915, he wrote to his parents, [...] "I have just sent five boys to France, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> that they will be in the firing line on Monday. It is just my luck to be unable to go." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} using entirely analogue equipment until post-mastering. Grohl {{said it was}} done that way because he felt digital recording {{was getting out of}} control: [...] "when I listen to music these days, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> Pro Tools and drums that sound like a machine- it kinda sucks the life out of music." [...] According to Grohl, the analog strategy would make the record [...] "sound rawer and somewhat imperfect", something which guitarist Chris Shiflett agreed was beneficial, declaring that [...] "rock n'roll is about flaws and imperfections". Bassist Nate Mendel added that [...] "we grew up making records on tape, which has a certain sound, certain limitations", and drummer Taylor Hawkins said that the digital recording in contemporary rock n' roll lead to an artificial sound : [...] "they kinda played it and then how someone else manipulated it in a computer, to make them sound a certain way." [...] Hawkins believed an analog project would help the band reclaim its artistic freedom.|$|E
500|$|Takemitsu's words here {{highlight}} his changing stylistic trends {{from the}} late 1970s into the 1980s, which {{have been described as}} [...] "an increased use of diatonic material [...] references to tertian harmony and jazz voicing", which do not, however, project a sense of [...] "large-scale tonality". Many of the works from this period have titles that include a reference to water: Toward the Sea (1981), Rain Tree and Rain Coming (1982), riverrun <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Hear</b> the Water Dreaming (1987). Takemitsu wrote in his notes for the score of Rain Coming that [...] "... the complete collection [...] entitled [...] "Waterscape" ... it was the composer's intention to create a series of works, which like their subject, pass through various metamorphoses, culminating in a sea of tonality." [...] Throughout these works, the S-E-A motive (discussed further below) features prominently, and points to an increased emphasis on the melodic element in Takemitsu's music that began during this later period.|$|E

500|$|... "Office Olympics" [...] {{was written}} by Michael Schur. This episode was the first episode of the series {{directed}} by Paul Feig. Producer Greg Daniels said {{the idea for the}} actual Office Olympics stemmed from The King of the Hill Office Olympics, which were created and ran by Daniel's former assistant Tim Croston and the show's two production assistants at the time: Tony Gennaro and Seranie Manoogian. The games were held in the King of the Hill offices, where Daniel served as executive producer. Daniels later elaborated on the types of games they played, stating [...] "Like, who’s going to get off the elevator first and races in chairs. The funny thing is then it became a TV episode and it has now gone full circle <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> offices are doing it all over." [...] After the episode aired, other [...] "Office Olympics" [...] were organized in actual offices across the country. The Chicago Tribune organized an interview with a majority of The Office cast members who—in character—explained the rules to the various games. The Yogurt Lid Medals reappear in the third season finale, [...] "The Job": Receiving the lid and a note from Pam is the catalyst for Jim's decision between Pam and Karen.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time Shakira's album evoked sharp {{criticism}} {{by a number of}} authors. David Browne from Entertainment Weekly, for instance, called the album a [...] "the ultimate in crossover nightmares" [...] and opined that Shakira's incorporation of different musical genres made it sound confusing, saying [...] "Its wan ska-pop, faux-country ballads, and generic rock barely betray a Spanish accent or any musical heritage. (She can't decide if she wants to sound like Alanis or Shania)". Matt Cibula from PopMatters gave a more mixed view in his review of Laundry Service; he complimented some of the lyrics of the songs but expressed disappointment in Shakira's production of the album, writing it off as [...] "generic". He felt that the album was [...] "extremely safe" [...] and speculated that the reason behind the album's [...] "generic" [...] sound was due to the Estefans' involvement, saying [...] "when I read that she's [...] helping you with lyrics and he's [...] 'executive producer', <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> the unmistakable hum of 'moneymoneymoneymoney' in the background [...]" [...] Ernesto Lechner from Rolling Stone complimented the singer's voice as a [...] "wild and beautiful instrument [...] capable of delivering scorching moments of musical passion," [...] but commented that the involvement of a [...] "battalion of producers and songwriters" [...] led to Shakira sounding [...] "downright silly" [...] on Laundry Service and also criticised [...] "her efforts to spice things up with obvious touches of Latin American folklore." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{first film}} of Dune, {{directed}} by Lynch, {{was released in}} 1984, nearly 20 years after the book's publication. Though Herbert said the book's depth and symbolism seemed to intimidate many filmmakers, he {{was pleased with the}} film, saying that [...] "They've got it. It begins as Dune does. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> my dialogue all the way through. There are some interpretations and liberties, but you're gonna come out knowing you've seen Dune." [...] Reviews of the film were not as favorable, saying that it was incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book, and that fans would be disappointed by the way it strayed from the book's plot.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the week}} prior to announcing his candidacy, Colbert {{appeared}} {{on a number of}} talk shows to promote his book I Am America (And So Can You). [...] During these interviews, he parodied potential candidates' standard approach to a White House run, giving broad and generally unprompted hints towards a campaign on shows like Larry King Live. [...] "A lot of people see this book as testing the waters for a run for political office," [...] he told King in an October 14, 2007 interview. On the same day, Colbert took over The New York Times opinion columnist Maureen Dowd's column, which he used to engage in similar speculation: [...] "I know why you want me to run, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> your clamor...Nevertheless, I am not ready to announce yet – even though it's clear that the voters are desperate for a white, male, middle-aged, Jesus-trumpeting alternative." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later, on 27 July, Austria-Hungary {{started to}} {{complete}} the preparations for war. That same day, Jagow informed Szögyény {{that he was only}} pretending to take up the British offers of mediation in order to ensure British neutrality but had no intention of stopping the war. Szögyény reported [...] "in order to avoid a misunderstanding" [...] that Jagow had promised him that [...] "the German government assured Austria in the most binding fashion that it in no way identifies itself with the proposal , which may very shortly be brought to Your Excellency 's notice by the German government: it is, on the contrary decidedly opposed to consideration of them and is only passing them on out of deference to the British request" [...] (emphasis in the original). Jagow went on to state he was [...] "absolutely against taking account of the British wish, because [...] "the German government point of view was that it was at the moment of the highest importance to prevent Britain from making common cause with Russia and France. We must therefore avoid any action [...] might cut the line, which has so far worked so well, between Germany and Britain". Szögyény ended his telegram that [...] "If Germany candidly told Grey that it refused to communicate England’s peace plan, that objective [...] might not be achieved." [...] Bethmann Hollweg, in a message to Prince Tschirschky, wrote on 27 July: [...] "As we have already rejected one British proposal for a conference, it is not possible for us to refuse this suggestion also a limine. If we rejected every attempt at mediation, the whole world would hold us responsible for the conflagration and represent us as the real war-mongers. That would also make our position impossible here in Germany, where we have got to appear as though the war had been forced on us. Our position is the more difficult because Serbia seems to have given way very extensively. We cannot therefore reject the role of mediator; we have to pass on the British proposal to Vienna for consideration, especially since London and Paris are continuously using their influence on St. Petersburg." [...] In passing on Grey's message, Bethmann Hollweg deleted the last line, which read: [...] "Also, the whole world here is convinced, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> from my colleagues that the key to the situation lies in Berlin, and that if Berlin seriously wants peace, it will prevent Vienna from following a foolhardy policy." [...] In his reply to London, Bethmann Hollweg pretended that: [...] "We have immediately initiated mediation in Vienna in the sense desired by Sir Edward Grey." [...] Jagow sent Grey’s offer to Tschirschky, his ambassador in Vienna, but ordered him to not show it to any Austrian official in case they might accept it. At the same time, Bethmann Hollweg sent a distorted account of Grey’s offer to Wilhelm.|$|E
