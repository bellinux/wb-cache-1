Here we reported the survey result with subjects of five prefectures in the Hokushin-etsu District such as Nagano, Niigata, Toyama, Ishikawa, and Fukui mentioned below: The following views commanded a majority in elementary and junior high schools with the registration of children with disability: ＊“Physical education is important”for children, effective for children with disability to understand“ the relationships with the other children”, <b>and</b> for children <b>without</b> <b>disability</b> to “understand handicaps”. ＊Many teachers cited“children are getting to enjoy and like physical activities”as objectives of physical education, while a few cited“children are getting to improve motor skills” as the objective. ＊Seventy percent of elementary and junior high schools did let children with <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>disability</b> together participate in school events on sports. ＊Many teachers were looking forward to obtaining knowledge on sports for the disabled as well as joining training sessions on this subject. ＊Many teachers considered difficult to progress physical education for children with <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>disability</b> together smoothly in a regular class for the following reasons: children <b>without</b> <b>disability</b> were hardly satisfied with the lesson of physical education with children with disability; the lesson with children with disability should be a burden on children <b>without</b> <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> it is difficult to conduct team events of children with <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>disability</b> together...|$|R

50|$|Almost one fifth (19%) of working-age {{people with}} {{disability}} who {{were employed in}} 2009 worked as professionals, followed by clerical and administrative workers,and technicians and trade workers (both 15%). The distribution of people across different occupations is similar for people with <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>disability.</b> However, there was some variation of occupations according {{to the type of}} disability. For example, around one third (34%) of employed people with intellectual disability were working as labourers, such as cleaners, in 2009, while one-fifth (20%) of employed people with sensory or speech disability were in professional occupations, such as secondaryschool teachers. Both people with <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>disability</b> had similar distributions across industry groups. Some industries had a higher than average (10%) disability prevalence rate, particularly Agriculture, forestry and fishing (15%) and Transport, postal and warehousing (12%). This may be partly reflective of the older age profile of people in these industries. People with disability who were working were more likely to run their own business (13%), and/or work from home (9%), than employed people <b>without</b> <b>disability</b> (10% <b>and</b> 6% respectively). Such situations may enhance the flexibility of working arrangements, making it easier for people with disabilityto participate in the labour force.|$|R

Setting: Team doctors and physiotherapists supporting England football teams recorded players' SCAT 3 baseline tests from August 1, 2013 to July 31, 2014. Participants: A convenience sample of 249 England footballers, of whom 185 were players <b>without</b> <b>disability</b> (male: 119; female: 66) and 64 were players with disability (male learning disability: 17; male cerebral palsy: 28; male blind: 10; female deaf: 9). Assessment and Outcome Measures: Between-group comparisons of median SCAT 3 total and section scores were made using nonparametric Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon ranked-sum test. Main Results: All footballers with disability scored higher symptom severity scores compared with male players <b>without</b> <b>disability.</b> Male footballers with learning disability demonstrated {{no significant difference in the}} total number of symptoms, but recorded significantly lower scores on immediate memory and delayed recall compared with male players <b>without</b> <b>disability.</b> Male blind footballers' scored significantly higher for total concentration and delayed recall, and male footballers with cerebral palsy scored significantly higher on balance testing and immediate memory, when compared with male players <b>without</b> <b>disability.</b> Female footballers with deafness scored significantly higher for total concentration and balance testing than female footballers <b>without</b> <b>disability.</b> Conclusions: This study suggests that significant differences exist between SCAT 3 baseline section scores for footballers with <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>disability.</b> Concussion consensus guidelines should recognize these differences and produce guidelines that are specific for the growing number of athletes living with disability...|$|R

Training groups practiced five FMS (run, jump, kick, throw, catch) in weekly 45 -min sessions for 4 weeks. Control groups had their regular physiotherapy (CP) or physical education (TD) sessions. FMS were evaluated using process- and product-oriented measures, and PA was measured using accelerometers, before and after training. Results: It was verified that training groups gained improvements in FMS while control groups did not. No significant changes in weekday PA were found. Increased weekend moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was found in the CP-FMS group, while decreased weekend sedentary time was found in the CP-FMS and TD-FMS groups. The percentages of participants who exceeded the minimum detectable change (MDC) in MVPA and sedentary time were larger in children with CP than in children <b>without</b> <b>disability.</b> Conclusion: The findings suggest that improved FMS proficiency could potentially contribute to heightened PA and decreased sedentary time during weekends for children. Such effect of improved FMS proficiency on PA appears to be greater in those with physical disability than in those <b>without</b> <b>disability.</b> It is recommended that the findings of this pilot study should be further examined in future research...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Panel {{data are}} often used to {{estimate}} key measures of public health, such as years lived with <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>disability.</b> Panel surveys commonly measure disability at intervals {{of one or two}} years, and occasionally more than two. It is likely that these intervals often include unreported changes in functional status. Unreported changes may bias estimates of disability transition probabilities, which are commonly used to estimate years lived with <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>disability.</b> Most surveys do not ask participants about periods with <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>disability</b> in the time since they last responded to the survey. We examined a way to improve the usefulness of panel surveys and our understanding of disability processes, by eliciting retrospective disability information. Methods Data were from the United States' National Long Term Care Survey. At each wave, this survey asks disabled respondents how long they have been disabled. We tested whether estimates of probabilities predicting changes in disability status can be improved by making use of this retrospective disability information. Methods included embedded Markov Chain analysis, microsimulation, and the Hausman specification test. Results Estimates based on data that include retrospective information are significantly different from those that use only the more limited information that is contemporaneous to the surveys. They are also more efficient. At age 65, all estimated probabilities for becoming disabled were higher when retrospective information was used, and all probabilities for remaining disabled were lower. Microsimulation revealed that using retrospective information increased the number of functional status transitions. For example, for women the mean number of transitions from nondisabled to disabled or dead was 52. 7 % greater when retrospective information was added to the analysis. Conclusion Our results suggest that the value of future panel studies for estimating transitions in disability could be notably enhanced by adding a small number of questions asking respondents for details about their disabilities–and lack of disabilities–in the period since a preceding survey wave. Information provided by such questions could substantially improve both the measurement of disability histories and estimates of disability processes. </p...|$|R
