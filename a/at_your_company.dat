40|$|Where and How to Recruit New PlayersThink of {{the last}} time someone was hired <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>company.</b> Think {{of the last}} time that you were hired. Was there a {{systematic}} appraisal process to find the right person? Or was someone selected for the job that was an easy and available choice – a sales manager at a supplier who had frequent contact with the company, for example, or a friend of the hiring manager’s brother? Even at large organizations, many selection committees, which ideally would choose candidates from a large pool of highly qualified individuals, have at best one candidate who is qualified. (Some have none!) In fact, research from the Center for Creative Leadership has shown that, in an astonishing one-quarter of executive hires, the person selected for the position was the only candidate considered (Sessa & Taylor, 2000). And that’s a shame. You can’t hire a great candidate you’re not aware of.

30|$|Potential {{participants}} were contacted through email and invited to partake in the study. Upon receipt of a participant’s consent {{to take part}} in the study, each participant was asked to provide written responses (via email) to questions pertaining to the participant’s educational background, years of experience in textile design, and current employment position. Next, telephone interviews were conducted with each participant to obtain information about the processes undertaken to design and develop interior textile products. An in-depth, semi-structured interview approach was employed to help guide responses and ensure that the research questions were addressed as well as to allow for follow-up questions when new ideas or topics were introduced. Interview questions were developed based on the review of literature (e.g. Handfield et al., 2001; Mace, 1997) and were designed to address the stated research questions. Open-ended questions were used to gather data because this approach can better “capture the nature and meaning of creative experience from the perspective of the research participants themselves” (Mace, 1997, p. 226). Example interview questions included, “What tools/aids did you use in designing the [identified] product?” and “What sustainable practices are incorporated <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>company</b> related to product design and development?” The interviews ranged from 30 to 80  minutes in duration. The interviews were audio-recorded and upon completion of the data collection were transcribed verbatim. Written transcriptions of the interviews were sent to each participant to verify individual responses to the interview questions. Data collection was concluded when saturation in the participants’ responses was realized (Glaser and Strauss, 1967).|$|E

Y ou have {{probably}} been using NetWare 4. 11 on <b>your</b> <b>company’s</b> network for quite some time, and if you are like most network administrators who manage NetWare 4. 11 networks, you have found that NetWare 4. 11 is as reliable as sunrise in the morning and supports all of the applications that users need to do their work. Why, then, would you or <b>your</b> <b>company</b> want to change the networking status quo? After all, you’re busy enough with everyday tasks, such as keeping the printers printing and updating NDS User objects. Why subject yourself to the added (and oft times odious) task of a network upgrade? If it ain’t broken, why fix it, right? Wrong—at least in the context of considering an upgrade from NetWare 4. 11 to NetWare 5. 1.
