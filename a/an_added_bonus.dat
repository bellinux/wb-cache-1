5|$|Claymore {{took place}} on 4 March 1941. The Germans were caught {{unprepared}} and the landings were unopposed. Within an hour No. 4 Commando had taken all its objectives. The raid was a success: 11 fish oil factories and storage tanks were destroyed, 10 ships sunk, 225 prisoners taken with {{an unknown number of}} German sailors killed on the sunken ships. <b>An</b> <b>added</b> <b>bonus</b> were the 315 Norwegian volunteers brought back to join the Free Norwegian Forces.|$|E

25|$|Alexios {{appealed to}} Philip {{to help him}} and his father regain the Byzantine throne. Fortunately for Alexios IV, Phillip had good {{connections}} with the new leader of the Fourth Crusade, Boniface I of Montferrat (Theobald III, Count of Champagne had died in 1201). Therefore, when Alexios offered 500 Knights, 10,000 soldiers along with food and money to help the Crusaders with their drive to Egypt, Doge Dandolo and the other leaders of the Fourth Crusade happily accepted this new challenge. Both {{the money and the}} troops were desperately needed by the Crusaders as they had neither in the quantities they required- especially to pay of the Venetian debt of 34,000 silver marks. As <b>an</b> <b>added</b> <b>bonus,</b> Alexios IV promised to submit the Byzantine Church to the Church of Rome.|$|E

25|$|Heraclius later {{moved on}} to the Great Palace of Dastagird only to {{discover}} that Khosrau II had fled his Palace. In a fit of rage, Heraclius ordered that everything be burnt to the ground. Moving on, he soon found that Khosrau no longer commanded the loyalty of his subjects— as they refused to rally to defend Ctesiphon. Heraclius waited a week or two before marching his army back. Khosrau's son Siroes took power as Kavadh II and had his father shot to death with arrows. Later, the formation of a peace treaty favourable to the Byzantines led to the restoration of the pre-war boundaries. As <b>an</b> <b>added</b> <b>bonus,</b> all captives and Christian relics that had been captured by the Persians were returned. Thus, it was {{at the head of the}} True Cross that Heraclius entered the Capital on September 14, 628 triumphant. Leading a procession which included four elephants, the True Cross was placed high atop the altar of the Hagia Sophia.|$|E
25|$|The {{defeat of}} the Ottomans {{considerably}} changed the mood within Constantinople. The rewards reaped by the Empire were outstanding considering that {{only a short time}} had passed since the city (and possibly the Empire itself) stood on the brink of destruction. John VII appeared to have achieved numerous other benefits for Byzantium. The first was a non-aggression treaty between the local Christian powers (who were also free from Ottoman servitude), meaning that the disasters of Andronikos III's later rule would not be repeated. Next were a treaty between Byzantium and the successor of Bayezid, Süleyman who was in Asia Minor, confirming Byzantium's freedom from paying tribute. The Empire also gained Mount Athos and coastal land of the Black Sea from Constantinople to Varna. As <b>an</b> <b>added</b> <b>bonus,</b> Imperial authority was asserted over a number of Aegean Islands. The importance of the latter should not be underestimated as these would serve in the future as refuge for any seeking to escape Ottoman expansion, even if only as a temporary refuge.|$|E
500|$|By the mid-eighties, post-disco {{dance music}} was {{extremely}} popular {{and the concept}} of remix was widely regarded as a new direction of music. Several artists were remixing their tracks and compiling them to create new albums. Hence Madonna, who was the most popular dance artist of that era, decided to create a similar remix compilation album, later titled You Can Dance, which included seven of her up-tempo songs. Along with the pre-released tracks in remixed form, [...] "Spotlight" [...] was included as <b>an</b> <b>added</b> <b>bonus.</b> Madonna said that she was inspired by the song [...] "Everybody Is a Star" [...] (1970), by American rock band Sly and the Family Stone.|$|E

500|$|Edward L. Risden {{described}} [...] "Heroes and Demons" [...] as [...] "Pulp TV tackles mead-hall ritual" [...] in his book, co-authored with Nickolas Haydock, Beowulf on Film: Adaptations and Variations. He {{added that}} it gave the Beowulf story [...] "a new twist adaptive to science fiction and to audiences who want human interest even in electronic projections." [...] Michelle Erica Green, while reviewing the episode for TrekToday, said that the plot was [...] "pretty superficial" [...] and the science was [...] "pretty nonsensical". But she {{said that it was}} a [...] "delightful outing for the Doctor" [...] and demonstrated the potential for the character. Jamahl Epsicokhan, at his website Jammer's Reviews, called the plot a [...] "lame-brained exercise in the obvious", but praised the performance of Picardo and the drama within the holodeck. He described McCarthy's score as [...] "ambitious", and added that the production design was [...] "convincing" [...] providing <b>an</b> <b>added</b> <b>bonus</b> to the episode.|$|E
500|$|The {{series was}} a {{candidate}} for the [...] "Best and Worst of 2010", a list compiled by the Bucks County Courier Times; the series was under the [...] "Best Animated TV Show" [...] category. Patrick Broadnax of the Huntsville Examiner named the series one of [...] "The Most Underrated Shows on Television". He argued that, in its second season, the show was [...] "shining as one of [...] best decisions ever." [...] He praised the spirit of the series, noting that it was reminiscent of the [...] "charm that 90's cartoon held so gracefully". He concluded that the show was [...] "goofy, colorful fun that should be able to put a smile on anyone's face." [...] Tyler Foster of DVD Talk wrote that the season release was [...] "highly recommended". He praised that the season was able to [...] "explor and [...] on everything that" [...] was set up in the first season of the show. He specifically praised [...] "Power Animal, [...] "Death in Bloom", [...] "Crystals Have Power", and [...] "Her Parents" [...] as the best episodes from the set. Foster was slightly critical of the visual presentation, noting that some aliasing was present, but felt that the commentaries were <b>an</b> <b>added</b> <b>bonus.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The use of {{adjuvant}} analgesics is {{an important}} and growing part of the pain-control field and new discoveries are made practically every year. [...] Many of these drugs combat the side-effects of opioid analgesics, <b>an</b> <b>added</b> <b>bonus.</b> [...] For example, antihistamines including orphenadrine combat the release of histamine caused by many opioids. Stimulants such as methylphenidate, caffeine, ephedrine, dextroamphetamine, methamphetamine, and cocaine work against heavy sedation and may elevate mood in distressed patients as do the antidepressants. The use of medicinal cannabis remains a debated issue.|$|E
2500|$|In 1951 Ziegler {{continued}} her torrid pitching, {{ending with a}} 14–8 (.636) record and topping the league with a 1.26 ERA.

2500|$|Jimmy Page told Rolling Stone in 1975, [...] "We {{were careful}} to never release it as a single." [...] So, Led Zeppelin refused {{to release the}} song as a single, which forced buyers to buy the entire album. Despite {{pressure}} from Atlantic Records, the band would not authorise the editing of the song for single release, making [...] "Stairway to Heaven" [...] {{one of the most}} well-known and popular rock songs never to have been released as a single. It did, however, appear on two promotional discs in the United States, one of them featuring the 7:55 track on each side, and the other as a 7" [...] 33 record produced for jukebox operators with [...] "Stairway to Heaven" [...] on one side and both [...] "Black Dog" [...] and [...] "Rock and Roll" [...] on the other.

2500|$|The song {{received}} {{positive reaction}} from critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it [...] "a thumping track which sounds funkier, denser, sexier with each spin". Jim Farber of The New York Daily News gave the song a positive review, stating {{that it is}} [...] "everything a single should be. Pithy, simple and maddeningly catchy, it's her most instantly embraceable single since 'Holiday.'" [...] Farber {{goes on to say}} that it is the song's chorus that [...] "kills," [...] and the [...] "power of dance music" [...] theme of the song is used to comment on current trends. In a review of the album, Vibe called the track [...] "a bouncing parade of synthesizers that pose the question 'Do fortysomething baby-mamas still have the divine right to get down?' (The answer is yes). And so, as the vocoders gurgle and the analog synths invoke Zapp, a slowly building crescendo of rhythm announces Madonna's return." [...] Entertainment Weekly said [...] "the song recaptures the simple perfection of [...] "Holiday" [...] (1982) and brings her career full circle." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine praised the song in a review of the album: [...] " [...] is a retro hands-in-the-air club song reminiscent of Debbie Deb's 'When I Hear Music' and Madonna's own 'Into The Groove'", and called the singer's best dance track since [...] "Vogue", [...] "She sings 'Music makes the people come together' like a track off of her debut album, and as <b>an</b> <b>added</b> <b>bonus</b> she uses words like [...] "bourgeoisie" [...] and [...] "acid-rock" [...] with equal abandon", he completed.|$|E

2500|$|Due to the {{conflicting}} personalities of his protagonist couple, Sparks faced difficulty {{in finding a}} vehicle that would draw Will and Ronnie to spend time together. “It had to be during the summer, she [...] had to be new in town, and whatever happened had to start in June and end in August. Because you always want a conclusion,” said Sparks of his requirements. He mentioned summer camp or a summer job as typical vehicles used in books, but dismissed them as unoriginal and boring. “So it’s got to be original, it’s got to be interesting, {{and at the same}} time it’s got to be universal, that you feel like it could happen to anybody.” Sparks eventually chose to have Will and Ronnie bond over a loggerhead sea turtle nest, knowing that Loggerhead eggs often hatch in August. The scene of the hatching nest took place during the first week of August and involved 26 live loggerhead sea turtle hatchlings. Sea turtle hatchlings have an innate sense to head toward the ocean water as soon as they are born, so scenes of the nest hatching had to be taken swiftly. Said Mike Dodd of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, the biologist who supervised the scene, the hatchlings [...] "did all they know how to do: They crawled down to the water and swam off." [...] Sparks told an interviewer he suspected filmmakers would digitally add more turtles to the scene. At the time of filming, the loggerhead sea turtle was listed as a threatened species. The environmentally friendly theme was <b>an</b> <b>added</b> <b>bonus</b> to Tybee Island, which was then promoting ecotourism.|$|E
