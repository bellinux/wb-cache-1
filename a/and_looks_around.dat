Peggy realises that Stacey needs to look after her daughter so she leaves. Ryan confronts Stacey at the hospital, shocked with her confession, refuses to acknowledge his daughter, and goes on his honeymoon with Janine. Peggy goes into the pub <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> as she remembers events from her time there. She then tells Billy she wants to take Phil away to make a fresh start and to protect him. Her niece Ronnie (Samantha Womack) tells Peggy she is five months pregnant and asks Peggy not to leave as she is like a mother to her. Peggy tells Ronnie to give her real mother, Glenda (Glynis Barber), another chance. Peggy's daughter Sam (Danniella Westbrook) does not want her to leave as Peggy promised to look after Sam's baby Richard for her, however, Peggy says she is old now and the baby needs a strong mother. Peggy gives her jewellery to Sam to sell so she has some money. Peggy speaks to Phil, accepting responsibility for making him {{the way he is}} and offering to help him get off the drugs. He says she needs him more than he needs her and that she suffocates him. Realising that he is right, Peggy asks the rest of her family to look after him, saying emotional goodbyes. Though Phil claims not to have meant what he said, Peggy says she has to leave for his sake. As she leaves the house, Phil begins to follow her, but she sends him back inside. She looks at the pub and walks out of Walford.|$|E
2500|$|Mulan {{tells her}} {{they can still}} track the helm and Merida says if her dad can’t lead without magic, neither can she. Later, Mulan takes the cloak scrap and goes to see the witch {{to get her to}} tell her who the cloak belongs to. She goes into the witch’s house <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around.</b> The wolf snarls and leaps. Mulan backs away and it follows her outside. Then Mulan smiles at her and says she’s not a wolf, and {{transforms}} into Ruby, who told them that Mary Margaret and Emma told them about Mulan and she says she knows Philip and Aurora too. Mulan gets quiet and says it’s hard to travel between realms then asks how Red ended up here. Its revealed in a flashback after defeating Zelena that Ruby told Mary Margaret that being the only one of her kind in Storybrooke, she wanted to return to the Enchanted Forest to find others like her with a magic bean given to her by Tiny who had managed to grow one. But when she arrived back in the Enchanted Forest, the pack had already left and so she sought help from the witch to find them but instead she turned her back into a wolf to be her guard. When they arrived to the lake and used the spell to bring the helm up, both Arthur and Zelena are stopped by Mulan, Merida, and Ruby. Merida then fights Arthur after finding out he killed her father while Mulan and Ruby use sleeping powder on Zelena as payback. Arthur and Zelena return to Camelot defeated when the clans of DunBroch arrive to aid Merida.|$|E

60|$|ROBERTS, {{entering}} the room before Campbell, and {{shaking hands with}} his guests: 'Ah, Mr. Bemis; Mrs. Bemis; Aunt Mary! You've heard of our comical little coincidence--our--Mr. Bemis and my--' He halts, confused, <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> for the moral support of Willis, who follows hilariously.|$|E
6000|$|The small dust-coloured beetle climbs {{with pain}} [...] O'er the smooth {{plantain}} leaf, a spacious plain! [...] Then higher still by countless steps conveyed, [...] He gains {{the summit of}} a shivering blade, [...] And flirts his filmy wings <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around,</b> [...] Exulting in his distance from the ground.|$|E
6000|$|The play is done; {{the curtain}} drops, [...] Slow {{falling to the}} prompter's bell: [...] A moment yet the actor stops, [...] <b>And</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around,</b> to say farewell. [...] It is an irksome word and task; [...] And, when he's laughed and said his say, [...] He shows, as he removes the mask, [...] A face that's {{anything}} but gay.|$|E

60|$|Left {{to myself}} I sank {{into a chair}} with such relief as only the poor {{homeless}} country boy knows when {{at the end of}} a long tramp from the station, he lets slip his hand-bag <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> upon a room for which he has paid. It was a plain little chamber, but it meant shelter and sleep and I was grateful. I went to bed early.|$|E
6000|$|... "So I starts {{foraging}} for breakfast. For the honour of old Mojada County I didn't want to seem {{green to}} them abolitionists, so every time I {{turned a corner}} in them marble halls I {{went up to the}} first desk or counter I see <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> for grub. If I didn't see what I wanted I asked for something else. In about half an hour I had a dozen cigars, five story magazines, and seven or eight railroad time-tables in my pockets, and never a smell of coffee or bacon to point out the trail.|$|E
6000|$|... "So, Bassett rents a room over a saloon <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> {{for some}} {{furniture}} and chromos. The same night I went to Monty Silver's house, {{and he let}} me have $200 on my prospects. Then I went to the only store in Los Perros that sold playing cards and bought every deck in the house. The next morning when the store opened I was there bringing all the cards back with me. I said that my partner {{that was going to}} back me in the game had changed his mind; and I wanted to sell the cards back again. The storekeeper took 'em at half price.|$|E

[...] And still the curtains swing, [...] But noiselessly; [...] The bells a melancholy murmur ring, [...] As tears {{were in the}} sky: [...] More heavily the shadows fall, [...] Like the black foldings of a pall, [...] Where juts the rough beam from the wall; [...] The candles flare [...] With fresher gusts of air; [...] The beetle's drone [...] Turns to a dirge-like, solitary moan; [...] Night deepens, and I sit, in cheerless doubt, alone." ...|$|E
60|$|Shaking {{from head}} to foot, the man whose {{scattered}} consciousness has thus fantastically pieced itself together, at length rises, supports his trembling frame upon his arms, <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around.</b> He is in the meanest and closest of small rooms. Through the ragged window-curtain, the light of early day steals in from a miserable court. He lies, dressed, across a large unseemly bed, upon a bedstead that has indeed given way under the weight upon it. Lying, also dressed and also across the bed, not longwise, are a Chinaman, a Lascar, and a haggard woman. The two first are in a sleep or stupor; the last is blowing at a kind of pipe, to kindle it. And as she blows, and shading it with her lean hand, concentrates its red spark of light, it serves in the dim morning as a lamp to show him what he sees of her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{the train}} rolled in, {{and a little}} woman in a gray dress, with sort of {{illuminating}} hair, slides off <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> quick. And the Boy Avenger sees her, and yells 'Mamma,' and she cries 'O!' and they meet in a clinch, and now the pesky redskins can come forth from their caves on the plains without fear any more of the rifle of Roy, the Red Wolf. Mrs. Conyers comes up and thanks me an' John Tom without the usual extremities you always {{look for in a}} woman. She says just enough, in a way to convince, and there is no incidental music by the orchestra. I made a few illiterate requisitions upon the art of conversation, at which the lady smiles friendly, as if she had known me a week. And then Mr. Little Bear adorns the atmosphere with the various idioms into which education can fracture the wind of speech. I could see the kid's mother didn't quite place John Tom; but it seemed she was apprised in his dialects, and she played up to his lead in the science of making three words do the work of one.|$|E
