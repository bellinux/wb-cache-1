5|$|At {{the federal}} level, Minneapolis proper sits within Minnesota's 5th congressional district, {{which has been}} {{represented}} since 2006 by Democrat Keith Ellison, the first practicing Muslim in the United States Congress. Both of Minnesota's two U.S. Senators, Amy Klobuchar and <b>Al</b> <b>Franken,</b> were also elected while living in Minneapolis and are also Democrats.|$|E
5|$|Born in New York City, Franken {{moved to}} Minnesota {{when he was}} four. With his writing partner Tom Davis, {{with whom he had}} {{developed}} an interest in improvisational theater at the prestigious college preparatory school The Blake School, he was hired as a writer for SNL at its inception in 1975. He worked on the show as a writer and performer until 1980, and returned from 1985 to 1995. After leaving SNL, he wrote and acted in movies and television shows. He also hosted a nationally syndicated political radio talk show, The <b>Al</b> <b>Franken</b> Show, and wrote seven books, four of which are political satires critical of conservative politics. His latest book, <b>Al</b> <b>Franken,</b> Giant of the Senate, about his time in the Senate, was a New York Times Non-Fiction Best Seller.|$|E
5|$|Saint Paul is {{the heart}} of Minnesota's 4th congressional district, {{represented}} by Democrat Betty McCollum. The district has been in DFL hands without interruption since 1949. Minnesota is represented in the US Senate by Democrat Amy Klobuchar, a former Hennepin County Attorney, and Democrat <b>Al</b> <b>Franken,</b> a former comedian and political commentator.|$|E
5|$|The {{writers of}} Saturday Night Live clashed with Henson's {{vision for the}} program. Michael O'Donoghue, Alan Zweibel, and <b>Al</b> <b>Franken</b> often tried to avoid writing the weekly sketches. Henson felt {{they were trying to}} write for {{situational}} comedy rather than staying within his intended story. Frank Oz eventually agreed the partnership between Henson's team and the show's writers was imperfect, and was thankful they moved on to The Muppet Show.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota's United States {{senators}} are Democrat Amy Klobuchar and Democrat <b>Al</b> <b>Franken.</b> The {{outcome of the}} 2008 U.S. Senate election in Minnesota was contested until June 30 the next year; when the Minnesota Supreme Court {{ruled in favor of}} Franken, Republican Norm Coleman conceded defeat, and the vacant seat was filled by Franken. The state has eight congressional districts; they are represented by Tim Walz (1st district; DFL), Jason Lewis (2nd; R), Erik Paulsen (3rd; R), Betty McCollum (4th; DFL), Keith Ellison (5th; DFL), Tom Emmer (6th; R), Collin Peterson (7th; DFL), and Rick Nolan (8th; DFL).|$|E
5|$|Franken and Tom Davis were {{recruited}} {{as two of}} the original writers (and occasional performers) on Saturday Night Live (SNL) (1975–1980, 1985–1995). In Season 1 of SNL, as apprentice writers, the two shared a salary of $350 per week. Franken received seven Emmy nominations and three awards for his television writing and producing while creating such characters as self-help guru Stuart Smalley. Another routine proclaimed the 1980s the <b>Al</b> <b>Franken</b> Decade. Franken and Davis wrote the script of the 1986 comedy film One More Saturday Night, appearing in it as rock singers in a band called Bad Mouth. They also appeared in minor roles in All You Need Is Cash and in the Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd film Trading Places.|$|E
5|$|The state's U.S. Senate seats have {{generally}} been split since the early 1990s, and in the 108th and 109th Congresses, Minnesota's congressional delegation was split, with four representatives and one senator from each party. In the 2006 midterm election, Democrats were elected to all state offices except for governor and lieutenant governor, where Republicans Tim Pawlenty and Carol Molnau narrowly won reelection. The DFL posted double-digit gains {{in both houses of}} the legislature, elected Amy Klobuchar to the U.S. Senate, and increased the party's U.S. House caucus by one. Keith Ellison (DFL) was elected as the first African American U.S. Representative from Minnesota, as well as the first Muslim elected to Congress nationwide. In 2008, DFLer and former comedian and radio talk show host <b>Al</b> <b>Franken</b> beat incumbent Republican Norm Coleman in the United States Senate race by 312 votes out of 3 million cast.|$|E
5|$|During the 2008 election, New York state {{officials}} asserted that <b>Al</b> <b>Franken</b> Inc. {{had failed to}} carry required workers' compensation insurance for employees who assisted him with his comedy and public speaking from 2002 to 2005. Franken paid a $25,000 fine {{to the state of}} New York upon being advised his corporation was out of compliance with the state's workers' compensation laws. At the same time, the California Franchise Tax Board reported that the same corporation owed more than $4,743.40 in taxes, fines, and associated penalties in the state of California for 2003 through 2007, because the corporation did not file tax returns in the state for those years. A Franken representative said that it followed the advice of an accountant who believed when the corporation stopped doing business in California that no further filing was required. Subsequently, Franken paid $70,000 in back income taxes in 17 states dating back to 2003, mostly from his speeches and other paid appearances. Franken said he paid the income tax in his state of residence, and he would seek retroactive credit for paying the taxes in the wrong states.|$|E
5|$|The Senate {{began work}} on its own {{proposals}} while the House was still working. The United States Constitution requires all revenue-related bills to originate in the House. To formally comply with this requirement, the Senate used H.R. 3590, a bill regarding housing tax changes for service members. It had been passed by the House as a revenue-related modification to the Internal Revenue Code. The bill became the Senate's vehicle for its healthcare reform proposal, discarding the bill's original content. The bill ultimately incorporated elements of proposals that were reported favorably by the Senate Health and Finance committees. With the Republican Senate minority vowing to filibuster, 60 votes {{would be necessary to}} pass the Senate. At the start of the 111th Congress, Democrats had only 58 votes; the Senate seat in Minnesota ultimately won by <b>Al</b> <b>Franken</b> was still undergoing a recount, while Arlen Specter was still a Republican (he became a Democrat in April, 2009).|$|E
25|$|On April 13, 2009, a {{three-judge panel}} ruled that <b>Al</b> <b>Franken</b> {{received}} the most votes in Minnesota's 2008 Senate race and ruled against Coleman's claims on all counts. Coleman appealed this decision. On June 30, 2009, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled unanimously that <b>Al</b> <b>Franken</b> received the most votes, and Norm Coleman conceded defeat after the ruling, allowing <b>Al</b> <b>Franken</b> to be Senator-elect of Minnesota. Franken {{was sworn in as}} Minnesota's junior Senator on July 7.|$|E
25|$|The 2008 U.S. Senate {{election}} in Minnesota featured first-term Republican incumbent Senator Norm Coleman, Democrat <b>Al</b> <b>Franken,</b> a comedian and radio personality, and former U.S. Senator Dean Barkley, {{a member of}} the Independence Party of Minnesota.|$|E
25|$|All of her {{remaining}} tour dates {{were canceled}} by their respective venues, and U.S. Senator <b>Al</b> <b>Franken</b> from Minnesota disinvited Griffin from a promotional event for his upcoming book. U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto from Nevada announced {{she is going}} to donate the $1,000 received from Griffin to charity.|$|E
25|$|In the 114th Congress, {{there are}} 10 Jews among 100 U.S. Senators: nine Democrats (Michael Bennet, Richard Blumenthal, Barbara Boxer, Benjamin Cardin, Dianne Feinstein, <b>Al</b> <b>Franken,</b> Carl Levin, Charles Schumer, Ron Wyden), and Bernie Sanders, {{who became a}} Democrat to run for President but {{returned}} to the Senate as an Independent.|$|E
25|$|Coleman {{was cleared}} of {{wrongdoing}} regarding allegations {{of corruption in}} receiving gifts of $100,000 from Kazeminy. Doug Grow, a MinnPost columnist, expressed skepticism about the findings. Coleman responded with a campaign ad in which he denied the allegations and blamed them on his opponent in the 2008 senate race, Democrat <b>Al</b> <b>Franken.</b>|$|E
25|$|St. Louis Park is {{the birthplace}} or {{childhood}} home of movie directors Joel and Ethan Coen, musician Peter Himmelman, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, Senator <b>Al</b> <b>Franken,</b> songwriter Dan Israel, guitarist Sharon Isbin, writer Pete Hautman, football coach Marc Trestman, and film director Joe Nussbaum. Baseball announcer Halsey Hall also lived there.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, before {{becoming}} the cornerstone for Air America Radio, <b>Al</b> <b>Franken</b> did an interview. Shortly after the 2004 election, Tom Shales from the Washington Post {{called in to}} discuss the political ramifications of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) crackdown on terrestrial radio. To their credit, Ron and Fez managed simulcasts of the 2004 presidential debates and election returns.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} two months after the election, no major {{innovations}} in content were introduced. A substantial percentage of the articles focused on Senatorial races: the runoff in Georgia, won by Saxby Chambliss; recounts of votes in Alaska (won by Mark Begich), and Minnesota (<b>Al</b> <b>Franken</b> vs. Norm Coleman); and the appointments of Senatorial replacements in Colorado, New York, and Illinois.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Michaels {{oversaw the}} writing of a sketch {{anthology}} feature film titled The Saturday Night Live Movie {{with many of the}} show's then-current writing staff, including <b>Al</b> <b>Franken,</b> Tom Davis, Greg Daniels, Jim Downey, Conan O'Brien, Robert Smigel, and George Meyer, contributing. The screenplay only got as far as a Revised First Draft dated July 26, 1990 before being abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Minnesotan politics, {{news and}} Indian Country are {{often found in}} Denomie's {{contemporary}} history paintings. The intense recount between <b>Al</b> <b>Franken</b> and Norm Coleman is shown in Split Decision, where Paul Wellstone is the referee standing between the two politicians, dressed like boxers. Denomie's signature cast of characters sit in the audience: Wabooz, an Indian riding a horse, a coyote, a moose, and plenty of unenthusiastic people.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Coleman's opponents {{for reelection}} were Dean Barkley and the DFL nominee, former Air America host and comedian <b>Al</b> <b>Franken.</b> On {{the day after}} the election, Coleman led in votes and claimed victory in the race. Minnesota law {{requires}} an automatic recount when the margin between the leading candidates is less than 0.5% of the vote, and the margin between Coleman and Franken was about 0.01%. Barkley came in third with 15%.|$|E
25|$|When the new Senate {{was first}} sworn in, {{the balance was}} 58–41 {{in favor of the}} Democrats, because of the {{unresolved}} Senate election in Minnesota. The defection of Republican Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania in April 2009 and the swearing-in of Democrat <b>Al</b> <b>Franken</b> of Minnesota in July 2009 brought the balance to 60–40. Republican Scott Brown won a January 2010 special election in Massachusetts to replace the deceased Democrat Ted Kennedy, making the balance 59-41 {{before the start of the}} next election cycle.|$|E
25|$|He is an {{advocate}} of nuclear disarmament, {{a supporter of the}} Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, sits {{on the board of the}} Nuclear Threat Initiative, and is an honorary Board Member of the anti-war grant-making foundation Ploughshares Fund. In 1998, he was appointed UN Messenger of Peace by Secretary-General Kofi Annan. He is a notable Democrat and has donated money to Barack Obama, Christopher Dodd, and <b>Al</b> <b>Franken.</b> He has been a major supporter of gun control since John Lennon was murdered in 1980.|$|E
25|$|He was roasted by the New York Friars Club for a Comedy Central {{television}} {{special in}} 2002. This roast was noted for being unusually vitriolic. The only cast members of Saturday Night Live's first season who {{appeared at the}} roast were Laraine Newman (one of the actors on the show), <b>Al</b> <b>Franken,</b> a bit player and writer {{on the show and}} eventually a U.S. Senator, and Paul Shaffer (a band leader on SNL in the 1970s and the host of the roast).|$|E
25|$|Honaker {{graduated}} in 1969 from Laramie High School {{and was the}} first member of his family to receive a college degree. He procured his Bachelor of Arts with honors in English and government in 1973 from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. At Harvard, he and future U.S. Senator <b>Al</b> <b>Franken</b> of Minnesota, washed dishes together as work-study students. Still another classmate of Honaker's was the assassinated Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan. At Harvard, {{he was a member of}} the Hasty Pudding Club.|$|E
25|$|In May 2005, Sirota {{became a}} {{contributor}} to The Huffington Post while writing his own blog. He was a regular guest on The <b>Al</b> <b>Franken</b> Show and makes guest appearances on The Colbert Report, Countdown with Keith Olbermann, NOW, Lou Dobbs Tonight, CNBC, and NPR. He {{is a senior editor}} at In These Times, a regular columnist for The Nation and the Intermountain Jewish News, and a past contributor to The American Prospect. He has been published in The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, the Baltimore Sun, and the San Francisco Chronicle.|$|E
25|$|Hartmann's {{national}} program, {{on the air}} since 2003 and now in {{the noon}} to 3PM ET daypart, was chosen by Air America to replace <b>Al</b> <b>Franken</b> on most Air America affiliates in 2007. From 2008 to 2011, Talkers Magazine rated Hartmann the most popular liberal talk show host in America, rising from number 10 among all talk show hosts in 2008 to number 8 in 2011 and 2015. According to his then-syndicator Dial Global, more people listened to Hartmann's show on more stations than any other progressive talk show in America. The Thom Hartmann Program is estimated by industry magazine Talkers to have 2.75 million unique listeners per week.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2008 elections, the Republican Party, {{reeling from}} the loss of the presidency, Congress and key state governorships, was {{fractured}} and leaderless. Michael Steele became the first black chairman of the Republican National Committee, but was a poor fundraiser and was replaced after numerous gaffes and missteps. Republicans suffered an additional loss in the Senate in April 2009, when Arlen Specter switched to the Democratic Party, depriving the GOP of a critical 41st vote to block legislation in the Senate. The seating of <b>Al</b> <b>Franken</b> several months later effectively handed the Democrats a filibuster-proof majority, but it was short-lived as the GOP took back its 41st vote when Scott Brown won a special election in Massachusetts in early 2010.|$|E
25|$|While Ventura has {{not held}} public office {{since the end}} of his term as {{governor}} in 2003, he has remained politically active and has occasionally hinted at intentions of possibly running again for political office. In an interview on CNN's The Situation Room on April 7, 2008, Ventura said that he was considering entering the race for the United States Senate seat then held by Norm Coleman, his Republican opponent in the 1998 Gubernatorial race. A poll commissioned by Twin Cities station Fox 9 put him at 24 percent, behind Democratic candidate <b>Al</b> <b>Franken</b> at 32 percent and Norm Coleman at 39 percent in a hypothetical three-way race. However, Ventura announced on Larry King Live on July 14, 2008, that he would not run; Ventura's decision not to join the race was partly rooted from a fear of a potential lack of privacy for his family, a concern that contributed to his refusal to seek a second term as governor. Franken ended up winning the election.|$|E
500|$|<b>Al</b> <b>Franken,</b> Giant of the Senate (Grand Central Publishing, 2017) ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{an article}} by Richard Corliss {{published}} in Time magazine, [...] "In a way, Franken has been running for office since the late '70s." [...] Corliss also hinted at Franken's [...] "possibly ironic role as a relentless self-promoter" [...] in proclaiming the 1980s [...] "The <b>Al</b> <b>Franken</b> Decade" [...] and saying, [...] "Vote for me, <b>Al</b> <b>Franken.</b> You'll be glad you did!" [...] In 1999, Franken released a parody book, Why Not Me?, detailing his hypothetical campaign for President in 2000. He had been {{a strong supporter of}} Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone and was deeply affected by the Senator's death in a plane crash shortly before the 2002 election. Wellstone was a mentor and political and personal role model for Franken, who stated his hopes of following in the late Senator’s footsteps.|$|E
500|$|Colbert {{filled in}} for Sam Seder {{on the second}} episode of The Majority Report on Air America Radio, and has also done reports for The <b>Al</b> <b>Franken</b> Show. He {{appeared}} on a track on Wig in a Box, a tribute album for Hedwig and the Angry Inch. Colbert read the part of Leopold Bloom in Bloomsday on Broadway XXIV: Love Literature Language Lust: Leopold's Women Bloom on June 16, 2005, at Symphony Space in New York City. He appeared {{in a series of}} TV commercials for General Motors, as a not-too-bright investigator searching for the elusive (and non-existent in real life) [...] "Mr. Goodwrench". He also portrayed the letter Z in Sesame Street: All-Star Alphabet, a 2005 video release.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of the book for The American Scholar, Siva Vaidhyanathan of New York University wrote that MacLeod [...] "...delivers a lively, {{personal}} account of the ways intellectual property messes with people—and how he messes with intellectual property", and that, [...] "McLeod is ironic and witty, writing with a hip-hop-influenced youth-savvy diction that demonstrates his confidence and engagement with the material and the culture that means so much to him." [...] Davis Schneiderman wrote positively of the work in a review for American Book Review, comparing it to similar works on the subject matter, including No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies (2000) by Naomi Klein, and writings of Michael Moore and <b>Al</b> <b>Franken.</b>|$|E
500|$|Canadian Broadcasting Corporation News Online {{columnist}} Heather Mallick wrote, [...] "Colbert had the wit and raw {{courage to}} do to Bush what Mark Antony did to Brutus, murderer of Caesar. As the American media has self-destructed, it takes Colbert to damn Bush with devastatingly ironic praise." [...] Comedian and eventual Democratic U.S. Senator <b>Al</b> <b>Franken,</b> who performed at similar dinners twice during the Bill Clinton administration, admired what Colbert had done. In its year-end issue, New York magazine described Colbert's performance {{as one of the}} most [...] "brilliant" [...] moments of 2006. Time's James Poniewozik noted that in the [...] "days after Stephen Colbert performed at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, this has become the political-cultural touchstone issue of 2006—like whether you drive a hybrid or use the term 'freedom fries.|$|E
500|$|Writer Michael O'Donoghue said, [...] "I don't {{write for}} felt". In a 1977 {{interview}} for Playboy, O'Donoghue called The Land of Gorch characters [...] "fucking Muppets" [...] and [...] "little hairy facecloths". Saturday Night Live writer Alan Zweibel said the writers drew straws {{to decide who}} would draft that week's Muppet routine. Zweibel said {{that in addition to}} himself, other writers who disliked working on scripts for The Land of Gorch included Michael O'Donoghue, <b>Al</b> <b>Franken,</b> and Tom Davis. Zweibel had personal disagreements with Jim Henson, who disapproved a few storylines. Henson's associate Jerry Juhl said John Belushi hated having the Muppets on the show. Juhl said they went through virtually every writer on the program trying to find one who would write sketches both parties could agree with.|$|E
500|$|Franken {{signed a}} one-year {{contract}} in early 2004 to host a talk show for Air America Radio's flagship program with co-host Katherine Lanpher, who remained with the show until October 2005. The network was launched March 31, 2004. Originally named The O'Franken Factor but renamed The <b>Al</b> <b>Franken</b> Show on July 12, 2004, the show aired three hours a day, {{five days a week}} for three years. The stated goal of the show was to provide the public airwaves with more progressive views to counter what Franken perceived was the dominance of conservative syndicated commentary on the radio: [...] "I'm doing this because I want to use my energies to get Bush unelected," [...] he told a New York Times reporter in 2004. Franken's last radio show on Air America Radio was on February 14, 2007, {{at the end of which}} he announced his candidacy for the United States Senate.|$|E
500|$|In August 1979, Shearer {{was hired}} as a writer and cast member on Saturday Night Live, one of the first {{additions}} to the cast, and an unofficial replacement for John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, who were both leaving the show. <b>Al</b> <b>Franken</b> recommended Shearer to Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels. Shearer describes his experience on the show as a [...] "living hell" [...] and [...] "not a real pleasant place to work." [...] He did not get along well with the other writers and cast members and states that he was not included with the cast in the opening montage (although he was added to the montage for latter episodes of the 1979-80 season) and that Lorne Michaels had told the rest of the cast that he was just a writer. Michaels left Saturday Night Live {{at the end of the}} fifth season, taking the entire cast with him. Shearer told new executive producer Jean Doumanian that he was [...] "not a fan of Lorne's" [...] and offered to stay with the show if he was given the chance to overhaul the program and bring in experienced comedians, like Christopher Guest. However, Doumanian turned him down, so he decided to leave with the rest of the cast.|$|E
