25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

She called him her [...] "friend" [...] and explained that on this account Cassandra must be anxious {{to know more about}} her new [...] "friend". Five days later in another letter, Austen wrote she expected an [...] "offer" [...] from her [...] "friend" [...] and that [...] "I shall refuse him, however, unless he promises to give away his white coat", going on to write [...] "I will confide myself in the future to Mr Tom Lefroy, for whom I don't give a sixpence" [...] and refuse all others. The next day, Austen wrote: [...] "The day will come on which I flirt my last with Tom Lefroy and when you receive this it will be <b>all</b> <b>over.</b> <b>My</b> tears flow as I write at this melancholy idea".|$|E

500|$|Clarkson {{performed}} [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards. Her performance garnered positive {{reviews from}} critics, who considered {{it one of}} the highlights in the event. Performing barefoot, Clarkson sang the song as rain cascaded onto the audience. Clarkson told People that one of her favourite moments on television was performing [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] at the MTV Video Music Awards, saying [...] "I hate being all dressed up, so the fact that I was soaking wet with mascara smeared <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> face was definitely the highlight of my evening!" [...] Becky Bain of Idolator thought that the performance was Clarkson's most memorable live performances while Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times thought Clarkson's performance was very solid despite the feeling that she sounded better dry than drenched. Clarkson performed the song on Saturday Night Live in 2005, along with the 2006 BRIT Awards which took place in Earls Court, London.|$|E
500|$|The {{band has}} looked back on Neighborhoods more {{recently}} with a divided reaction. In 2012, DeLonge would {{concede that the}} recording method, originally his idea, led {{to a loss of}} unity, noting that e-mails dictated the majority of recording of the record, due to the hectic schedules of the band. [...] "There's some songs on there that I love, {{but for the most part}} it was disconnected," [...] Barker recalled. [...] "It was like, 'You do this part in your studio, and then you're gonna play on it and send it back to me.' When we're not in the studio together, you don't have the opportunity to gel off each other." [...] In addition, Barker was still recovering from his 2008 plane crash, which made things difficult in the studio. [...] "Dude, I was still healing," [...] he told Rolling Stone. [...] "I had scabs <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> body and was, like, a bloody mess. It was just way too soon." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{create the}} Mummy, Berton used a {{combination}} of live action and computer graphics. Then, he matched the digital prosthetic make-up pieces on Vosloo's face during filming. Berton said, [...] "When you see his film image, that's him. When he turns his head and half of his face is missing {{and you can see}} right through on to his teeth, that's really his face. And that's why it was so hard to do." [...] Vosloo described the filming as a [...] "whole new thing" [...] for him; [...] "They had to put these little red tracking lights <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> face so they could map in the special effects. A lot of the time I was walking around the set looking like a Christmas tree." [...] Make-Up Effects Supervisor Nick Dudman produced the physical creature effects in the film, including three-dimensional make-up and prosthetics. He also designed all of the animatronic effects. While the film made extensive use of computer generated imagery, many scenes, including ones where Rachel Weisz's character is covered with rats and locusts, were real, using live animals.|$|E

2500|$|Madonna first {{performed}} [...] "Erotica" [...] as {{the opening}} number of her fourth concert tour, The Girlie Show World Tour of 1993. The show {{opened with a}} topless pole dancer sliding down a pole dangling high above the stage. As the dancer disappears into the stage, Madonna emerges dressed as a short-haired dominatrix, wearing a domino mask, sequined black hot pants and bra paired with knee-high boots and brandishing a riding crop. She performed the song while rubbing the crop between her legs; as she performed, her dancers posed and danced suggestively around her. On his review of the concert in New York City, Jon Pareles from The New York Times, felt that [...] " [...] the ethereal Put your hands <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> body in 'Erotica', the choreography suggests exercises rather than unbridled passion".

2500|$|Because of the {{recurring}} violent and sexual lyrics and profanity, often specifically directed at governmental {{organizations such as}} the LAPD, N.W.A always enjoyed a particular reputation with U.S. Senators and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), as noted in the LP's published notes. This situation persisted over the years with the group's visible head, Eazy-E. One of the reasons for this was [...] "Fuck tha Police", the highly controversial track from the album that resulted in the FBI and the U.S. Secret Service sending a letter to Ruthless Records informing the label of their displeasure with the song's message, and N.W.A was banned from performing at several venues. The FBI letter only helped further popularize the album and N.W.A, and in the group's 1990 song [...] "100 Miles and Runnin'", while the music video shows the crew running from the police, Dr. Dre raps [...] "and now the FBI is <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> dick!" [...] {{as a response to the}} FBI's warnings. Also, in his 1990 song [...] "Amerikkka's Most Wanted", Ice Cube mocks the FBI with the line [...] "With a pay-off, cop gotta lay off, FBI on my dick, stay off".|$|E

2500|$|In August 1972 MacCallum {{provided}} lead vocals for [...] "It's Time", {{which was}} written and produced by Pat Aulton. The concept and words were by Paul Jones the Creative Director of the campaign. It {{was used as the}} theme on Australian Labor Party's TV and radio ads during Gough Whitlam's 1972 federal election campaign, making MacCallum a famous name through saturation radio and TV airplay, despite the single failing to chart. According to James Cockington [...] "even though Labor was not credited on the label nor mentioned in the lyrics, most radio stations were reluctant to play the song, sensing its party-political roots". MacCallum was joined in the TV ads with a variety of celebrities including Bert Newton, Col Joye, Judy Stone, John Dease, Hazel Phillips, Ted Hamilton, Bellbird cast members, and Bobby Limb. Some of the celebrities suffered a negative backlash from appearing in the ads, Stone recalled [...] "we didn't get paid for it, but we certainly lost a lot of work over it ... Some of us were black banned from clubs, and I had garbage thrown <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> lawn. And I wasn't the only one singled out".|$|E
2500|$|There {{were several}} {{incidents}} {{during the trial}} where Saddam showed defiance against the court's authority. At one point, Saddam's legal defense team {{stormed out of the}} court after questioning the tribunal's legitimacy, and asking about return of defence papers seized by US Army troops and security issues regarding the protection of the defense. Saddam, along with his co-defendants, railed against Chief Judge Amin and the tribunal. The next day, after listening to hours of testimony against him, he lashed out at the judge. He said that he was exhausted, he did not intend on returning to the trial, and to [...] "go to hell". Later, on 7 December 2005, Saddam refused to enter court, complaining of the conditions in which he was being held and the conduct of the trial. Saddam's complaints included, among other things, that he {{had not been able to}} change his clothes for four days. On 12 December 2005, instead of cross-examining witnesses, Saddam accused his American captors of torturing him, saying, [...] "I have been beaten on every place of my body, and the signs are <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> body." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sito {{mentioned}} that Joe Grant contributed heavily towards the film, {{as he was}} the creator of Redfeather, Meeko, and Flit. Redfeather was a wise-cracking turkey planning to be voiced by John Candy, and Percy, who was to be voiced by Richard E. Grant, was revised to become mute. Following the death of John Candy in March 1994, co-screenwriter Susannah Grant decided the turkey was inappropriate for the script she co-wrote for Pocahontas, and a more realistic approach would have the animals pantomime instead of talking. Joe Grant stated Redfeather [...] "had comic potential–he thought he was handsome, a lady's man. When we decided he couldn't talk, and, having no hands, he couldn't mime..." [...] Grant would later draw a concept sketch of a hair-braiding raccoon, in which Glen Keane animated and claimed the directors [...] "loved the idea and {{got rid of the}} turkey character." [...] Likewise, according to Sito, Meeko was created because they were [...] "naturally enigmatic, because they have little hands and a little mask over their face like a thief." [...] Gabriel described the inspiration for Flit the hummingbird where [...] "I have hummingbirds <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> backyard, [...] I thought, 'That's a great animal to animate.'" [...] According to the directors, Governor Ratcliffe's pampered pet, Percy, was based on history as the royalty of the time often carried small pugs wherever they went.|$|E
