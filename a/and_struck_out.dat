5|$|After {{starting}} a July 4 {{game against the}} Braves (which he won), Richard was sent into the bullpen to add Tom Griffin into the Astros' starting rotation. He made three relief appearances against the Montreal Expos before making a start against the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 27. Four days later, Richard threw his first shutout against the Dodgers, in which he gave up just five hits <b>and</b> <b>struck</b> <b>out</b> nine batters. Nineteen days later, Richard pitched another complete game, this time giving up two runs while striking out nine and walking three batters. He concluded the season with six wins and two losses in 16 total games, 10 of which he started. He finished with a 4.00ERA, <b>and</b> <b>struck</b> <b>out</b> 75batters in 72innings. He walked 38batters, giving him a ratio of 4.75walks per nine innings, which was lower than the ratio he had had in his two previous minor league seasons.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{threw the}} no-hitter despite {{being unable to}} feel the ball or see the batter or catcher clearly. Ellis said his catcher Jerry May wore {{reflective}} tape on his fingers which helped him to see May's signals. Ellis walked eight batters <b>and</b> <b>struck</b> <b>out</b> six, and he was aided by excellent fielding plays from second baseman Bill Mazeroski and center fielder Matty Alou.|$|E
5|$|In {{his five}} {{seasons with the}} Marlins, Beckett had a 41–34 record, a 3.46 ERA <b>and</b> <b>struck</b> <b>out</b> a total of 607 batters in 106 games. In his final start as a Marlin, on September 23, 2005, against the Atlanta Braves, he struck out six in seven shutout innings but earned a no {{decision}} in a game the Marlins eventually lost.|$|E

5|$|On June 23 at AT Park {{against the}} San Diego Padres, Bumgarner struck out a career-high {{fourteen}} batters, tying Atlee Hammaker's franchise {{record for most}} strikeouts in a single game by a left-handed pitcher. On June 28, in a 6–3 win over the Colorado Rockies at AT Park, Bumgarner had two hits, one a solo home run, scored twice, <b>and</b> <b>struck</b> <b>out</b> Brandon Barnes for his one-thousandth career strikeout. He is also the third left-handed pitcher in the San Francisco Era and the third youngest in franchise history to reach the milestone. Only Amos Rusie (21) and Christy Mathewson (25) were younger.|$|E
5|$|On September 15, 2014, deGrom {{faced the}} Marlins <b>and</b> <b>struck</b> <b>out</b> his first eight batters, tying the MLB record. Near {{the end of}} the season, deGrom was shut down for the year, ending his season with a 9–6 record, a 2.69 ERA and 144 strikeouts. DeGrom won the 2014 Sporting News NL Rookie of the Year Award and was named the NL Rookie of the Year by the Baseball Writers' Association of America, (the first by a Met since Dwight Gooden in 1984) {{receiving}} first place votes on 26 of the 30 ballots.|$|E
5|$|Red Sox closer Foulke came in {{to pitch}} {{the bottom of the}} ninth. Pujols led off the inning by hitting a single through Foulke's legs and into center field. After Foulke induced Rolen into a fly out <b>and</b> <b>struck</b> <b>out</b> Edmonds, Pujols took second base, but no stolen base due to fielder's indifference. Édgar Rentería then hit a ground ball that bounced back to Foulke on the mound. Foulke threw it underhand to Doug Mientkiewicz at first base to end the game, and secure the series.|$|E
50|$|He {{made his}} major league debut on June 26, 2006 against the New York Yankees and {{subsequently}} <b>and</b> surprisingly <b>struck</b> <b>out</b> Jason Giambi.|$|R
50|$|Caraway's most {{remarkable}} day came in 1930, when he <b>struck</b> <b>out</b> Joe Sewell twice. Sewell {{was the most}} difficult batter in baseball history to strike <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> he <b>struck</b> <b>out</b> only three times all that season.|$|R
50|$|Stephanie Brombacher throw {{six innings}} before being {{relieved}} by Stacey Nelson, who earned the save. Brombacher allowed only two hits, but walked three <b>and</b> only <b>struck</b> <b>out</b> four. Nelson <b>struck</b> <b>out</b> {{two of the}} three batters she faced.|$|R
5|$|Then, on September 7 he {{came within}} four outs of {{perfection}} when Milwaukee Brewers' Gabe Kapler hit a one-out {{home run in}} the eighth inning. He allowed two hits, did not walk a batter <b>and</b> <b>struck</b> <b>out</b> five, en route to 10–1 victory at Milwaukee's Miller Park. Young did not get his first perfect game or first no-hitter, but he did end up with the first complete game of his career after 114 starts. Two starts later he hit his first home run as a major league batter.|$|E
5|$|After his {{retirement}} from baseball, Grove {{continued to work}} with his uncle. His legacy lived on in his nephew, Wayne Grove. While playing for the Bellwood Lions of the Chicago Little League, Wayne pitched a no-hitter <b>and</b> <b>struck</b> <b>out</b> 15, and narrowly missed a perfect game when a runner got on base with two outs {{in the bottom of}} the ninth inning. Despite an unimpressive Major League career, Grove earned a few votes for induction into the Hall of Fame, receiving five votes in the 1958 balloting (1.9% of the required votes needed) and seven in the 1960 balloting (2.6% of the required votes needed).|$|E
5|$|Later that evening, several police cruisers {{filled with}} {{officers}} wearing riot gear {{arrived at the}} Elephant Walk Bar on Castro Street. Harvey Milk's protégé Cleve Jones and {{a reporter for the}} San Francisco Chronicle, Warren Hinckle, watched as officers stormed into the bar and began to beat patrons at random. After a 15-minute melee, they left the bar <b>and</b> <b>struck</b> <b>out</b> at people walking along the street. The chief of police finally ordered the officers out of the neighborhood. By morning, 61 police officers and 100 rioters and gay residents of the Castro had been hospitalized. City Hall, police cruisers, and the Elephant Walk Bar suffered damages in excess of $1,000,000.|$|E

5|$|On January 8, 1977, McLaughlin {{signed with}} the Seattle Mariners. On April 1, 1977, the Mariners loaned him to the Nuevo Laredo Mexican League franchise. At the time, the Mariners {{did not have a}} {{complete}} minor league organization. In the Mexican League that season, McLaughlin compiled a record of 18–13 with a 1.84 ERA and 221 strikeouts as his team, the Tecolotes, won the league championship. On September 11, 1977, he was returned to the Mariners. McLaughlin made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut on September 18, against the Kansas City Royals at Kaufman Stadium. In 1 innings pitched, he gave-up five hits, four runs (all earned), <b>and</b> <b>struck</b> <b>out</b> one in his only major league appearance that season.|$|E
5|$|Dragonfly nymphs vary in {{form with}} species and are loosely classed into claspers, sprawlers, hiders, and burrowers. The first instar {{is known as}} a prolarva, a {{relatively}} inactive stage from which it quickly moults into the more active nymphal form. The general body plan {{is similar to that of}} an adult, but the nymph lacks wings and reproductive organs. The lower jaw has a huge, extensible labium, armed with hooks and spines, which is used for catching prey. This labium is folded under the body at rest <b>and</b> <b>struck</b> <b>out</b> at great speed by hydraulic pressure created by the abdominal muscles. Whereas damselfly nymphs have three feathery external gills, dragonfly nymphs have internal gills, located around the fourth and fifth abdominal segments. Water is pumped in and out of the abdomen through an opening at the tip. The naiads of some clubtails (Gomphidae) that burrow into the sediment, have a snorkel-like tube at the end of the abdomen enabling them to draw in clean water while they are buried in mud. Naiads can forcefully expel a jet of water to propel themselves with great rapidity.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich Tønnies (1825–1903) {{remains to}} date {{one of the}} premier CDV photographers of Denmark. In June 1856 he began his {{photographic}} career as a partner under C. Fritsche in Aalborg and by December of the same year he bought his partner's share of the business <b>and</b> <b>struck</b> <b>out</b> with a studio under his own name. By 1861, Tönnies' business boomed requiring a larger studio and the hiring of assistants, and by 1870 he became a Danish citizen. Ultimately, his family business spanned three-generations and 75 years. The breadth of his photographic products included: Daguerreotypes, calotypes, pannotypes, photo-lithography, stereoscopy, ambrotypes, CDVs, and medallions. It is believed that he produced no less than 75,000 CDVs, many ordered in relation to a large wave of emigration from Nordjylland to North America. Owing to the poverty of Denmark's Vendsyssel region, local demands for inexpensive CDVs persisted in Aalborg right up until World War I, making Tönnies' studio one of the last to produce CDVs in Denmark.|$|E
50|$|Gibson's {{performance}} in Game 1 was phenomenal. The menacing right-handed pitcher {{shut out the}} Tigers on just five hits, <b>and</b> he <b>struck</b> <b>out</b> a World Series-record 17 Detroit Tigers batters.|$|R
50|$|In {{the finale}} of the 1934 National High School Baseball Championship, Fujimura faced Tetsuharu Kawakami <b>and</b> <b>struck</b> him <b>out</b> {{three times in}} three at-bats. Fujimura's team won the championship.|$|R

5|$|I {{remained}} on the wreck until she went down; the suction took me down some way, and a man got hold of my leg, but I managed to kick him off and came up <b>and</b> <b>struck</b> <b>out</b> for some pieces of wood {{that were on the}} water and started for land, about two miles off. I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F. Girardot, 43rd Light Infantry, to his father, 1 March 1852.|$|E
5|$|Kershaw {{made his}} fourth {{straight}} opening day {{start for the}} Dodgers in 2014, only the fourth Dodger ever to do so. This season the game was played at the Sydney Cricket Ground in Australia. Before his second start, Kershaw felt some pain in his back and {{was placed on the}} disabled list {{for the first time in}} his career. He did not rejoin the Dodgers until early May. On June 18, he pitched a complete game no-hitter against the Colorado Rockies <b>and</b> <b>struck</b> <b>out</b> a career-high 15 batters. The only batter to reach base was due to an error in the top of the seventh inning, costing Kershaw a perfect game. He is one of two pitchers in MLB history, along with Max Scherzer, with 15 strikeouts in a game while allowing no hits and no walks. Kershaw was 6-0 with an 0.82 ERA in June and was awarded his third career Pitcher of the Month award. He was selected to the National League squad at the 2014 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, his fourth straight selection. He was the sixth Dodger pitcher, and the first since Fernando Valenzuela to make the All-Star team four years in a row.|$|E
5|$|McLaughlin {{split the}} 1978 season between {{the major leagues}} and minors. McLaughlin made his season debut with Seattle on April 25, against the California Angels. In that game, which also marked his first MLB start, McLaughlin gave up three runs (all earned) <b>and</b> <b>struck</b> <b>out</b> 10 in six innings pitched. He came away with the loss, which was his first MLB decision. In late June the Mariners sent {{him down to the}} minor leagues. With the San Jose Missions, who were the Mariners Triple-A {{affiliate}} at the time, he went 5–2 with a 3.50 ERA, and 52 strikeouts in eight games, all starts. Two of those starts were complete games. McLaughlin was called back up to the majors in July after pitcher John Montague was placed on the disabled list. McLaughlin's first major league win came on August 16, against the Baltimore Orioles. In the majors that season, McLaughlin went 4–8 with a 4.37 ERA and 87 strikeouts in 20 games, 17 starts. Four of his starts were complete games. After the 1978 season, McLaughlin pitched in the Mexican Pacific League, where he led all pitchers with a 1.05 ERA and 143 strikeouts.|$|E

5|$|On September 25, manager Bruce Bochy {{decided to}} give Zito one final start with the Giants {{as a tribute to}} his tenure with the team. Zito responded by {{allowing}} two runs (one earned) over five innings and earning the win in a 7–4 victory over the Dodgers. However, because Zito was removed between innings during the Dodger game, Bochy sent him in to pitch in relief in the final game of the year so that Giants' fans could give him a standing ovation. Zito entered with two outs in the eighth inning on September 29 <b>and</b> <b>struck</b> <b>out</b> Mark Kotsay (playing his final game) as the Giants beat the Padres 7–6. He finished the 2013 season at 5–11 with a 5.74 ERA in 30 games, 25 of which were starts. Following the season, Zito took out a full-page ad in the San Francisco Chronicle thanking Giants fans for their support. The Giants declined Zito's 2014 option, buying it out for $7 million.|$|E
5|$|Richard started {{eight games}} with the Bears in 1973 and posted minor league career-worsts in ERA and hits allowed per nine innings. Despite his poor {{performance}} with the Bears, Richard was again called up by the Astros. Richard entered in the fourth inning of a June 16 game against the St. Louis Cardinals and his idol Bob Gibson. He pitched four innings of one-run ball and three innings of a two-hit game in his next relief outing.
