Gadahn's remarks in the video echoed those of <b>al-Qaida's</b> second-in-command, Ayman al-Zawahri, in a similar posting on militant websites earlier that month, suggesting the terror organization had decided on a single, simple message to promote following the floods that affected as many as 20 million people in Pakistan.|$|R
25|$|The {{mere fact}} that a {{decision-maker}} is conferred wide discretion by law is not reason enough for a weakening of the requirements of natural justice. In the United Kingdom context, this is demonstrated by Ahmed v. H.M. Treasury (No. 1) (2010). The Treasury had exercised powers to freeze the appellants' financial assets and economic resources {{on the ground that}} it reasonably suspected the appellants were or might be persons who had committed, attempted to commit, participated in or facilitated the commission of terrorism, pursuant to the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 and the <b>Al-Qaida</b> and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 made under the United Nations Act 1946. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom held that since the <b>Al-Qaida</b> Order made no provision for basic procedural fairness, it effectively deprived people designated under the order the fundamental right of access to a judicial remedy and hence was ultra vires the power conferred by the United Nations Act 1946 for the making of the Order.|$|E
25|$|Such {{networks}} function {{by having}} their sub-networks provide information {{and other forms}} of support (the ‘many-to-one’ model), while the core group supplies ‘truth’ and decisions/directions (the ‘one-to-many’ model). Trust and personal relationships are {{an essential part of the}} <b>Al-Qaida</b> network (a limiting factor, even while it provides enhanced security). Even while cell members are trained as ‘replaceable’ units, ‘vetting’ of members occurs during the invited training period under the observation of the core group.|$|E

Iraq's interaction with al-Qaeda is impelled by mutual antipathy toward the United States and the Saudi royal family and by bin Ladin's interest in unconventional weapons and relocation sites. The relationship between Iraq and al-Qaeda appears to more closely resemble that of two independent actors trying to exploit each other - their mutual suspicion suborned by al-Qaeda's interest in Iraqi assistance, and Baghdad's interest in <b>al-Qaida's</b> anti-U.S. attacks. The Intelligence Community has no credible information that Baghdad had foreknowledge of the 11 September attacks or any other al-Qaeda strike, but continues to pursue all leads.|$|R

(Foucault in Davidson, 1997, p. 7) This paper began as I was editing my in-process book, Getting Lost: Feminist Efforts Toward a Double(d) Science, and noticed slippage between the two terms scientism and scientificity. Curious as to what, exactly, was my object of critique, I began my journey with the internet, {{for the first time in}} my scholarly career, to see how the two terms shook down. Plunged into old and difficult questions, my struggle was to find a way to shift the terms of the debate away from rather tired epistemological contests and toward something useful in the very political contest over scientific research in education that is our situation today. In March of 2004, architect Zaha Hadid gave a lecture where she used terms such as soft grid, fluid city, nesting, layering, flood of spaces, imposed complexity toward multiple uses. 1 Around that same time, a newspaper article called for a different kind of thinking in “grasping [the] true nature of [the] enemy ” in the case of <b>Al-Qaida’s</b> intentions.
