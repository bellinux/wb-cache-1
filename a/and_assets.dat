5|$|Banjo-Tooie was {{developed}} by Rare and designed by Gregg Mayles, who previously worked on Banjo-Kazooie. Development of the game started in June 1998. Some features that were originally cut during the development of Banjo-Kazooie, such as some of its worlds and a multiplayer game mode, were instead integrated into Banjo-Tooie. An additional world set in a castle was planned, but due to time constraints, it was scrapped during development <b>and</b> <b>assets</b> from it were used in constructing Cauldron Keep. The game features roughly 150 total characters, including enemies and non-playable characters.|$|E
5|$|During the Paris Peace Conference, the Armenian {{delegation}} {{presented an}} assessment of $3.7 billion (about $ billion today) worth of material losses owned solely by the Armenian church. During the conference in February 1920, the Armenian community presented an additional demand for the restitution of property <b>and</b> <b>assets</b> seized by the Ottoman government. The joint declaration, which was submitted to the Supreme Council by the Armenian delegation and prepared by the religious leaders of the Armenian community, claimed that the Ottoman government had destroyed 2,000 churches and 200 monasteries and had provided the legal system for giving these properties to other parties. The declaration also provided a financial assessment of the total losses of personal property <b>and</b> <b>assets</b> of both Turkish and Russian Armenia with 14,598,510,000 and 4,532,472,000 francs respectively; totaling to an estimated $ billion today. Furthermore, the Armenian community asked for the restitution of church owned property and reimbursement of its generated income. The Ottoman government never responded to this declaration and so restitution did not occur.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{domestic}} {{debate over the}} permanent management of the nuclear program, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{was created by the}} Atomic Energy Act of 1946 to take over the functions <b>and</b> <b>assets</b> of the Manhattan Project. It established civilian control over atomic development, and separated the development, production and control of atomic weapons from the military. Military aspects were taken over by the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP). Although the Manhattan Project ceased to exist on 31 December 1946, the Manhattan District would remain until it too was abolished on 15 August 1947.|$|E

5|$|After {{two years}} of research, the Hrant Dink Foundation {{published}} a book, some 400 pages long, describing the current situation of seized assets and properties of the Armenian community. With the help of government deed and title records, {{the members of the}} Hrant Dink foundation have uncovered the title records of all the properties owned by various foundations and have produced the book replete with photographs, charts, maps, and other illustrations which describe the seized properties <b>and</b> <b>assets</b> and its current status. The Hrant Dink foundation states that 661 properties in Istanbul alone were confiscated by the Turkish government, leaving only 580 of the 1,328 properties owned by the 53 Armenian foundations (schools, churches, hospitals, etc.). The current circumstances of the remaining 87 could not be determined. Out of the 661 confiscated properties, 143 (21.6%) have been returned to the Armenian foundation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a concise {{overview of the}} development of an integrated property <b>and</b> <b>asset</b> market model (IPAMM) for South African property markets, utilising the Pretoria office market as case study. The IPAMM simulates the interrelationships between property <b>and</b> <b>asset</b> markets in a diagrammatic quadrant model configuration. The Fischer-DiPasquale-Wheaton (FDW) real estate model, arguably the most advanced diagrammatic quadrant real estate model available at present, served as basis for the development of IPAMM. IPAMM is essentially a regression model based on a system of stochastic equations that captures the interrelationships between property <b>and</b> <b>asset</b> markets. The model advances beyond mere conceptualisation of these relationships to a quantified interpretation and application of the theoretical premises that represent the micro-foundations of economic behaviour in property <b>and</b> <b>asset</b> markets...|$|R

5|$|Development of Sonic Generations {{began in}} 2008, {{following}} {{the completion of}} Unleashed. Sonic Team sought to re-imagine the most popular aspects of the franchise in high-definition, and developed the title using the Hedgehog Engine. Each location and boss in the game is one previously seen in an earlier entry in the series, with the game including numerous other references to past titles. While Sonic Team was the game's main developer, Devil's Details and Dimps helped develop the Windows and 3DS versions, respectively. The game was first revealed in an internal Sega document that was leaked in 2009, and was released on November 1, 2011. The Windows version is noted for its active modding scene, where a dedicated community creates new gameplay mechanics, levels, <b>and</b> <b>assets</b> for the game.|$|E
5|$|Groves {{hoped that}} a new, {{permanent}} agency {{would be created}} {{to take over the}} responsibilities of the wartime Manhattan Project in 1945, but passage of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 through Congress took much longer than expected, and involved considerable debate about the proper role of the military with respect to the development, production and control of nuclear weapons. The act that was signed by President Harry S. Truman on 1 August 1946 created a civilian agency, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), to take over the functions <b>and</b> <b>assets</b> of the Manhattan Project, but the commissioners were not appointed until October, and AEC did not assume its role until 1 January 1947. In the meantime, the Military Appropriation Act of 1946 gave the Manhattan Project $72.4 million for research and development, and $19 million for housing and utilities at Los Alamos and Oak Ridge.|$|E
5|$|Halo 2 {{was officially}} {{announced}} in September 2002 with a cinematic trailer, subsequently packaged with Halo: Combat Evolved DVDs. A real-time gameplay video was shown at E3 2003, {{which was the}} first actual gameplay seen by the public; it showcased new features such as dual-wielding and improved graphics. Many elements of the trailer, however, were not game-ready; the entire graphics engine used in the footage had to be discarded, and the trailer's environment never appeared in the final game due to limitations on how big the game environments could be. The restructuring of the engine meant that there was no playable build of Halo 2 for nearly a year, <b>and</b> <b>assets</b> and environments produced by art and design teams could not be prototyped.|$|E

The revenues of the Duchy form part of the Privy Purse, and are used for expenses not borne by the parliamentary grants. The Duchy of Cornwall is a similar estate held in trust to meet the expenses of the monarch's eldest son.

5|$|The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 {{created the}} Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{to take over}} the {{functions}} <b>and</b> <b>assets</b> of the Manhattan Project. President Harry S. Truman appointed its five commissioners on 28 October 1946, and Groves appointed Nichols as the military liaison officer to the AEC. Nichols' main responsibility was to help organize an orderly transfer of assets and responsibilities from the MED to the AEC. Military aspects were taken over by the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP). It was generally assumed that Nichols would become the AEC's Director of Military Application, but while Nichol's relationship with the AEC was cordial and the commissioners were impressed with his administrative skills, it also became clear that Nichols did not agree with the commissioners' concept of the Director of Military Application as a staff rather than a line function.|$|E
5|$|With {{the spread}} of {{cardiovascular}} surgery in India, the annual scientific meeting of the thoracic and cardiovascular surgeons was held independently in 1985 under the new title Association of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgeons of India. In 1990 the Indian Association of Cardiovascular-thoracic Surgeons was registered at Bombay. On 15 June 1991, the Association of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgeons of India was dissolved through a unanimous resolution passed by its general body during its annual meeting in Bombay, and its entire membership, funds, <b>and</b> <b>assets</b> were transferred to the new Association of Cardiovascular-thoracic Surgeons. Panday was elected as {{the first president of}} the latter society on 15 June 1991. The following year, the Fellowship of the Association (F.I.A.C.S) was instituted and regular biannual publication of the Journal of the Indian Association of Cardiovascular-thoracic Surgeons commenced.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1915, Bayer set up {{a number}} of shell {{corporations}} and subsidiaries in the United States, to hedge against the possibility of losing control of its American assets if the U.S. should enter the war and to allow Bayer to enter other markets (e.g., army uniforms). After the U.S. declared war on Germany in April 1917, alien property custodian A. Mitchell Palmer began investigating German-owned businesses, and soon {{turned his attention to}} Bayer. To avoid having to surrender all profits <b>and</b> <b>assets</b> to the government, Bayer's management shifted the stock to a new company, nominally owned by Americans but controlled by the German-American Bayer leaders. Palmer, however, soon uncovered this scheme and seized all of Bayer's American holdings. After the Trading with the Enemy Act was amended to allow sale of these holdings, the government auctioned off the Rensselaer plant and all Bayer's American patents and trademarks, including even the Bayer brand name and the Bayer cross logo. It was bought by a patent medicine company, Sterling Products, Inc.. The rights to Bayer Aspirin and the U.S. rights to the Bayer name and trademarks were sold back to Bayer AG in 1994 for US$1 billion.|$|E
5|$|Colin McRae Rally was {{developed}} by Codemasters' Southam-based development studio. It was the company's first internally developed mobile game, and lead off an initiative to produce games for new and existing intellectual property specifically for mobile devices. The development team was composed of staff who had worked on early Colin McRae Rally games and more recent Codemasters racing games. The game was initially designed for iOS mobile devices using Colin McRae Rally 2.0 as a basis. This early iteration of their Rally series {{was chosen as the}} foundation because it presented a focused rally racing experience, whereas later entries expanded to offer more gimmicks and game modes. Thirty stages from Rally 2.0 were faithfully reproduced; the team ensured that the position of every corner, obstacle, and surface transition matched the original rallies. While existing content <b>and</b> <b>assets</b> were reused, they also chose to take advantage of modern technology while creating Colin McRae Rally. The game was built using the Unity game engine and written in the C# programming language, closely referencing the original C source code to make certain that the handling and physics systems replicate Rally 2.0.|$|E
5|$|Day of the Tentacle Remastered {{retains its}} {{two-dimensional}} cartoon-style art, redrawn at higher resolution for modern computers. The high resolution character art was updated {{by a team}} led by Yujin Keim with consultation of Ahern and Chan. Keim's team used many of the original sketches of characters <b>and</b> <b>assets</b> from the two and emulated their style with improvements for modern graphics systems. Matt Hanson worked on recreating the background assets in high resolution. As with the Grim Fandango remaster, the player can switch {{back and forth between the}} original graphics and the high-resolution version. The game includes a more streamlined interaction menu, a command wheel akin to the approach used in Broken Age, but the player can opt to switch back to the original interface. The game's soundtrack has been redone within MIDI adapted to work with the iMUSE system. There is an option to listen to commentary from the original creators, including Schafer, Grossman, Chan, McConnell, Ahern, and Bajakian. The remaster contains the fully playable version of the original Maniac Mansion, though no enhancements have been made to that game-within-a-game.|$|E

5|$|On 27 September 1999, Color Air {{terminated}} all {{flights and}} ceased operations. Sunde {{stated that he}} regretted having started the airline, {{and said that he}} had overestimated the synergies between his ferry company and the airline, but also underestimated the price elasticity for business travel. In particular, the frequent flyer programs that SAS and Braathens had made it difficult to convince corporate travelers to switch to Color Air. Sunde believed that the company would continue to lose money in 2000. 220 employees lost their jobs, while Color Group estimated it lost NOK400 million on the airline. There were discussions concerning cooperation with, or a take-over by, British Airways, but these discussions did not lead to an agreement. In total, Color Air flew 430,000 passengers, effectively subsidizing each passenger with almost NOK1000. The company was not declared bankrupt, as Sunde wanted to insure his good reputation by paying everyone he owed money. While this was about NOK10 million in airport fees and smaller sums to other parties, the largest creditors were the two aircraft leasing companies, to whom NOK270 million was owed {{for the rest of the}} rental period. The 20,000 people who had tickets with Color Air were all rebooked onto Braathens flights. After NOK170 million in debt was registered by the company, <b>and</b> <b>assets</b> were only worth NOK17 million, Color Air was declared bankrupt on 10 November 1999.|$|E
5|$|On June 14, 1941, the Baltimore Steam Packet Company's owner, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} with a consortium of railroads and steamship companies to merge the Chesapeake Steamship Company into the Old Bay Line. The railroad group, consisting of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, Southern Railway, and the SAL, together controlled the Baltimore Steam Packet Company and the Chesapeake Steamship Company. As a result, the Old Bay Line took over the Chesapeake Line's business <b>and</b> <b>assets</b> and became the sole operator of passenger and freight steamship transportation between the important ports of Baltimore and Norfolk. As part of this agreement, half of the outstanding shares of the Baltimore Steam Packet Company was assigned to Chesapeake Steamship Company, which was one-third owned by Southern Railway and two-thirds owned by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. With the amalgamation, two of the Chesapeake Line's steamboats, the City of Norfolk and City of Richmond, were transferred to the Old Bay Line. As it turned out, these {{would be the last}} two vessels operated by the Old Bay Line when it went out of business in 1962. Robert E.
