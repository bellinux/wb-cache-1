Methods: In a cohort study involving 68 pregnant women with hypertension, 34 received antenatal betamethasone before amniocentesis and 34 did not. Controls were 68 women with uncomplicated pregnancies, matched for gestational age at amniocentesis and fetal gender. Amniotic fluid (AF) samples were analyzed by lamellar body count, planimetric and stechiometric lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio (L/S), and presence of phosphatidylglycerol. Results: Fetal lung maturity, as determined by lamellar body counts and by planimetric L/S, was lower in hypertensive pregnancies not treated with steroids than in controls (19, 600 +/- 14, 500 versus 39, 800 +/- 22, 700, P <. 009, and 1. 9 +/- 0. 6 versus 3. 9 +/- 1. 8, P <. 01, respectively). In the period of 24 to 33 weeks' gestation, the percentage of untreated pregnancies with mature lamellar body counts and mature L/S was significantly lower than that of controls (13 % versus 33 %, P <. 001; 6 % versus 40 %, P <. 002 and P <. 003, respectively). In contrast, in patients treated with betamethasone, the percentage of cases with mature indices for both tests was not significantly different from that of controls, but was higher than that of untreated hypertensive patients (40 % versus 13 %, P <. 001; 33 % versus 6 %, P <. 001). Phosphatidylglycerol did not differ among groups. From 34 to 38 weeks, no difference was found in the percentage of mature cases for lamellar bodies in pregnant women with hypertension not treated with steroids in comparison with controls (68 % versus 84 %), nor between cases treated and controls (74 % versus 84 %). In the same period, no difference in L/S values was found among groups, and the percentage of cases positive for phosphatidylglycerol was lower in hypertensive pregnancies than in controls (47 % versus 95 %, P <. 001) and was not affected by steroid treatment (37 % versus 95 %, P <. 001).

Contiguous lesion lines involving the mitral annulus and the orifices of the pulmonary veins were placed with RF energy application under direct vision to prevent anatomically defined LA re-entrant circuits. ResultsMean follow-up was 18 ± 7 months in patients with permanent AF and 18 ± 5 months in patients with paroxysmal AF. Antiarrhythmic drug treatment was instituted in patients with postoperative atrial arrhythmias to allow “reverse electrical remodeling” and was discontinued after three months.

Recent study by Jackson et al. showed that spectral method was not widely applicable in patients hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure, 49 % were ineligible for spectral TWA testing, due either to physical inability to undertake the <b>test,</b> <b>AF,</b> or pacemaker dependency [7].

40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown {{associations}} between blood lipid levels {{and the risk of}} atrial fibrillation (<b>AF).</b> To <b>test</b> the potential effect of blood lipids with AF risk, we assessed whether previously developed lipid gene scores, used as instrumental variables, are associated with the incidence of AF in 7 large cohorts. We analyzed 64, 901 individuals of European ancestry without previous AF at baseline and with lipid gene scores. Lipid-specific gene scores, based on loci significantly associated with lipid levels, were calculated. Additionally, non-pleiotropic gene scores for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) were calculated using SNPs that were only associated with the specific lipid fraction. Cox models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) of AF per 1 -standard deviation (SD) increase of each lipid gene score. During a mean follow-up of 12. 0 years, 5434 (8. 4 %) incident AF cases were identified. After meta-analysis, the HDLc, LDLc, total cholesterol, and triglyceride gene scores were not associated with incidence of AF. Multivariable-adjusted HR (95 % CI) were 1. 01 (0. 98 - 1. 03); 0. 98 (0. 96 - 1. 01); 0. 98 (0. 95 - 1. 02); 0. 99 (0. 97 - 1. 02), respectively. Similarly, non-pleiotropic HDLc and LDLc gene scores showed no association with incident AF: HR (95 % CI) = 1. 00 (0. 97 - 1. 03); 1. 01 (0. 99 - 1. 04). In this large cohort study of individuals of European ancestry, gene scores for lipid fractions were not associated with incident AF...|$|R
40|$|Background-The {{long-term}} {{efficacy of}} atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and R-wave synchronization are critical safety {{requirements for the}} development of an implantable atrial defibrillator (LAD) for treatment of AF. Methods and Results The long-term efficacy of the Metrix IAD for AF detection and R-wave synchronization was tested in 51 patients. The mean duration of follow-up was 259 +/- 138 days (72 to 613 days), <b>AF</b> detection <b>tests</b> were performed 2240 times during observed operation with 100 % specificity and 92. 3 % sensitivity for differentiation between sinus rhythm and AF; 2219 episodes and their electrograms stored in the device during AF detection were analyzed. The positive predictive value of the AF detection algorithm was 97. 4 % (lower 95 % confidence limit [CL], 94. 5 %) in the out-of-hospital setting. A total of 242 435 R waves were analyzed for R-wave synchronization. Of these, 49 % were marked for synchronized shock delivery, 82 % of sinus rhythm and 36 % of AF R waves, respectively. All shock markers were properly synchronized and within the R wave (overall synchronization accuracy, 100 %; lower 95 % CL, 99. 999 %). Overall, 3719 shocks have been delivered via the LAD with no instance of unsynchronized shock delivery or any episode of proarrhythmia. The observed proarrhythmic risk was 0 %, with an estimated maximum proarrhythmic risk of 0. 084 % per shock (95 % upper CL). Conclusions-The Metrix IAD can appropriately detect AF with a high specificity and sensitivity and reliably synchronize within a suitable R wave for shock delivery to minimize the risk of ventricular proarrhythmia...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundCatheter {{ablation}} is {{an effective}} and potentially curative treatment in patients with atrial fibrillation (<b>AF).</b> AimTo <b>test</b> the hypothesis that left atrial appendage peak flow velocity (LAV) assessed by echocardiography can accurately predict successful catheter ablation as well as favourable outcome {{in the setting of}} long-standing persistent AF. MethodsThis prospective pilot study enrolled 40 patients with long-standing persistent AF (age 60 ± 11 years; persistence of AF 4. 2 ± 2 years) who underwent a first catheter ablation procedure using a standardized sequential stepwise protocol. LAV was assessed before the catheter ablation procedure along with classical factors (age, sex, left atrial area, AF cycle length, AF duration and left ventricular ejection fraction), all of which were tested using logistic regression for ability to predict restoration of sinus rhythm during catheter ablation as well as absence of recurrence during a 1 -year follow-up. ResultsEighteen patients (45 %) experienced AF termination during the procedure and 18 patients (45 %) did not develop any recurrence during the first 12 months. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that high LAV (> 0. 3 m/s) was the only independent predictor of AF termination (odds ratio 5. 91, 95 % confidence interval 1. 06 – 32. 88; P= 0. 04) and absence of recurrence at 1 year (odds ratio 4. 33, 95 % confidence interval 1. 05 – 17. 81; P= 0. 04). ConclusionsThis pilot study demonstrated the feasibility and importance of LAV measurement in the setting of long-standing persistent AF to predict successful catheter ablation and favourable mid-term outcome...|$|R
40|$|Marine {{biofouling}} is {{the accumulation}} of organisms on underwater surfaces, causing increased ship hydrodynamic drag, which results in higher fuel consumption and decreased speed and range. Biofilms constitute {{a major component of}} the overall biofouling and may lead to a 14 % increase in ship fuel costs. Past solutions to antifouling (AF) have used toxic coatings which have subsequently been shown to severely affect marine life. The prohibited use of these antifoulants has led to the search for bio-inspired AF strategies. Current approaches towards the production of alternative coatings include the incorporation of natural AF compounds into paints. Screening assays for novel AF compounds are often separated into two categories; toxicity and AF assays. Increasingly there is evidence that active compounds affect organisms at non-toxic concentrations, hence, the necessity for more insightful <b>AF</b> <b>testing,</b> such as bacterial and diatom attachment. This study assessed natural product (NP) antifouling performance of two marine seaweeds (Chondrus crispus and Bifurcaria bifurcata) and two isolated pure compounds from terrestrial sources (usnic acid and juglone) against two marine biofilm bacteria, Cobetia marina and Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus. Overall it was found that all NPs affected bacterial attachment, however, juglone demonstrated the best AF performance against both bacterial species at a concentration range between 5 - 20 ppm. Biofilm colonisation is a surface related phenomenon, thus novel bioassays have been developed to directly test biofilm attachment and growth on NP-containing coatings for both static and hydrodynamic conditions. This study has incorporated NPs into a model coating system, using two formulations in order to assess their effect on biofilm growth. Laboratory screening of NP-containing coatings is often largely unexplored mainly due to difficulties in assessing their activity over short experimental time scales (typically only a maximum of a few days). To date there are {{only a limited number of}} reports on laboratory assessment for antifouling paints and their effect on biofilm growth and/or attachment. In this study, NP-containing model paints were applied on to coupons, placed in 24 -well plates and then inoculated with the marine biofilm forming bacteria. This has been achieved by the development of a novel bioassay protocol that has allowed the in situ observation of biofilm formation and growth, by corroborating different techniques such as a multidetection microplate reader and confocal laser scanning microscopy (through nucleic acid staining). There was good correlation between the two techniques which showed that the NP containing coatings significantly inhibited biofilm growth and also revealed marked differences in biofilm structure (e. g. bio-volume, morphology and thickness). The goal of this study was to develop a new protocol to allow assessment of biofilm formation on coatings in a high throughput non-invasive manner. New protocols and methods using microfluidic devices were developed for the assessment of bacterial attachments and initial biofilm formation in the presence and absence of a NP under hydrodynamic conditions. This led to the development and fabrication of a novel lab-on-a-chip device for the investigation of the biofilm response to different hydrodynamic conditions. The microfluidic flow channels were designed using computational fluid dynamic simulations so as to have a pre-defined, homogeneous wall shear stress in the channels, ranging from 0. 03 to 4. 30 Pa, which are relevant to in-service conditions on a ship hull.
