5|$|<b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> {{there were}} no Indians, but only a single British officer, John Money of the 9th regiment, Burgoyne's deputy quartermaster. He had been leading a group of Indians, but when they seemed {{reluctant}} to fight the Americans, Money became impatient and ran ahead of them; it was his war cries that brought {{an end to the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|His earlier {{insistence on}} not filming with live {{ammunition}} {{proved to be}} a good decision. Having been told while filming Angels with Dirty Faces that he would be doing a scene with real machine gun bullets (a common practice in the Hollywood of the time), Cagney refused and insisted the shots be added afterwards. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> a ricocheting bullet passed through exactly where his head would have been.|$|E

5|$|Ruth soon {{realized}} that Fuchs had deceived him, and {{had no intention of}} making him manager or giving him any significant off-field duties. He later stated that his only duties as vice president consisted of making public appearances and autographing tickets. Ruth also found out that far from giving him a share of the profits, Fuchs wanted him to invest some of his money in the team in a last-ditch effort to improve its balance sheet. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> both Fuchs and Ruppert had known all along that Ruth's non-playing positions were meaningless.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe's final {{event was}} the decathlon, his first—and <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> his only—Olympic decathlon. Strong {{competition}} from local favorite Hugo Wieslander was expected. Thorpe, however, easily defeated Wieslander {{by more than}} 700 points. He placed in the top four in all ten events, and his Olympic record of 8,413 points would stand for nearly two decades. Overall, Thorpe won eight of the 15 individual events comprising the pentathlon and decathlon.|$|E
5|$|To this day, George P. Burdell {{is listed}} as a letterman in the {{official}} media guides of two Tech sports: from 1928 to 1930 in football and 1956 to 1958 in basketball. In 1969, Georgia Tech computerized its class registration, believing it had successfully {{found a way to}} keep students from registering Burdell for class that semester. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> hackers registered him for every class at the school that quarter, over 3,000 credit hours. He was subsequently re-enrolled several times, including in 1975 and 1980.|$|E

5|$|In September 1765, Adams {{was once}} again {{appointed}} by the Boston Town Meeting to write the instructions for Boston's delegation to the Massachusetts House of Representatives. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> he wrote his own instructions; on September 27, the town meeting selected him to replace the recently deceased Oxenbridge Thacher as one of Boston's four representatives in the assembly. James Otis was attending the Stamp Act Congress in New York City, so Adams was the primary author {{of a series of}} House resolutions against the Stamp Act, which were more radical than those passed by the Stamp Act Congress. Adams {{was one of the first}} colonial leaders to argue that mankind possessed certain natural rights that governments could not violate.|$|E
5|$|The Belles {{originally}} {{failed to}} qualify for the 2016 Paralympics after finishing third at the IBSA Goalball Asia Pacific Championships in Hangzhou, China. They were displaced to allow for an African team, Algeria <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> to compete in goalball for the first time. But following the re-allocation of Russia's spot, the Belles found themselves getting a last minute invite to Rio.They entered the tournament ranked ninth in the world. They performed better this time, fighting Uzbekistan to a draw, but they needed a win or draw in their final game against Canada to progress to the quarter finals, but lost 6-0, ending their second Paralympic campaign.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Ginóbili {{was injured}} {{for most of}} the campaign, managing only 44 regular season games and missing the 2009 NBA Playoffs entirely. San Antonio qualified for the playoffs as the third seed with a 54–28 record, but with an aging supporting cast (Bowen, Michael Finley and Kurt Thomas were all in their late 30s), the Spurs were only considered fringe contenders for the championship. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> the strong play of Duncan and Tony Parker were not enough to help the Spurs avoid a 4–1 defeat by Dallas, and the Spurs were eliminated {{in the first round of}} the playoffs for the first time since 2000.|$|E

5|$|Two {{years after}} the bridge's opening the Second World War broke out. Because of their close {{proximity}} to Chelsea Barracks {{it was expected that}} enemy bombers would target the three road bridges in the area, and a temporary bridge was built parallel to Chelsea Bridge. As with the four other temporary Thames bridges built in this period, it was built of steel girders supported by wooden stakes; however, despite its flimsy appearance it was a sturdy structure, capable of supporting tanks and other heavy military equipment. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> no enemy action took place in the area, and all three bridges survived the war undamaged. The temporary bridge was dismantled in 1945.|$|E
5|$|With a large {{construction}} programme, engineers made up 29.3% of Michaelmas Task Force. An Engineer Section headquarters was organised on 24 December 1943, {{only nine}} days before landing, consisting of five officers and five enlisted men. Later a jeep and a driver were {{borrowed from the}} 114th Engineer Battalion to provide transportation. The officers did not know each other and therefore were unaware of each other's capabilities. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> {{none of them had}} experience with amphibious operations, and only one had experience in airbase construction, although this was to be their most important task.|$|E
5|$|A world {{containing}} {{creatures who}} are significantly free (and freely perform more good than evil actions) is more valuable, all else being equal, than a world containing no free creatures at all. Now God can create free creatures, but He can't cause or determine {{them to do}} only what is right. For if He does so, then they aren't significantly free after all; they do not {{do what is right}} freely. To create creatures capable of moral good, therefore, He must create creatures capable of moral evil; and He can't give these creatures the freedom to perform evil {{and at the same time}} prevent them from doing so. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> sadly enough, some of the free creatures God created went wrong in the exercise of their freedom; this is the source of moral evil. The fact that free creatures sometimes go wrong, however, counts neither against God's omnipotence nor against His goodness; for He could have forestalled the occurrence of moral evil only by removing the possibility of moral good.|$|E

5|$|After the United States Army Corps of Engineers {{took over}} the Manhattan Project, it gave {{responsibility}} for the detailed design and construction of the reactors to DuPont. There was friction between the company and Wigner and his team. Major differences between Wigner's reactor design and DuPont's included {{increasing the number of}} process tubes from 1,500 in a circular array to 2,004 in a square array, and cutting the power from 500 MW to 250 MW. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> the design decision by DuPont to give the reactor additional tubes came in handy when neutron poisoning became a problem for the B Reactor at the Hanford Site. The extra tubes allowed a greater fuel load to overcome the poisoning. Without them the reactor would have had to be run at low power until enough of the boron impurities in the graphite had been burned up to allow it to reach full power, which would have delayed full operation by up to a year.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> the {{relationship}} between SHAEF and Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery's 21st Army Group was far from cordial, with the Deputy Supreme Commander, Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder, and the Deputy Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Frederick Morgan, both frequently critical of Montgomery. In September 1944 an intelligence crisis similar to Kasserine arose, when the cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park did not locate the 9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen and 10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg in the Arnhem area, but information from the Dutch resistance and a consequent photo reconnaissance ordered by Major Brian Urquhart, the Intelligence Officer at I Airborne Corps, confirmed the German presence. Strong and Smith then flew to Brussels to warn Montgomery. However, Montgomery decided to accept the risk rather than alter the plans for Operation Market Garden.|$|E
5|$|As {{the season}} concluded, the obvious {{standout}} draft choice for both leagues was Alabama quarterback Joe Namath. The Houston Oilers, {{in last place}} in the AFL East, had the number-one pick for the AFL. Both the Oilers and Jets realized that the Jets had a far better chance of signing Namath in competition with the NFL team which drafted him (<b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> the St. Louis Cardinals, formerly the Chicago Cardinals), and the Jets were able to acquire the number-one pick. Neither the Jets nor the Cardinals could sign Namath until Alabama played its {{final game of the}} season, the Orange Bowl, on January 1, 1965. Both the Jets and Cardinals negotiated with Namath's attorney, and when the price got too high for the Cardinals, the Giants secretly acquired Namath's NFL rights. Longtime Jets coach Walt Michaels admitted many years later that the Jets had signed Namath days before the game. On January 2, 1965, the Jets held a press conference to announce Namath's signing.|$|E

5|$|By July 1941, Morshead {{had become}} {{convinced}} that his troops were becoming tired. Their health was deteriorating and, {{in spite of}} his efforts, their morale and discipline were slipping. He informed Generals Blamey and Auchinleck that they should be relieved. Auchinleck arranged for the 18th Infantry Brigade to be relieved by the Polish Carpathian Brigade so that it could rejoin the 7th Division in August but baulked at relieving the 9th Division. At this point, political considerations came into play. The newly installed government of Prime Minister John Curtin in Australia, on Blamey's advice, took up the matter with Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who protested that the relief would cause a postponement of Operation Crusader. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> the operation had to be postponed anyway. In October 1941, Morshead and most of the 9th Division was replaced by the British 6th Division. The 9th Division moved to Syria to serve as an occupation force, as well as resting, re-equipping and training reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Det norske Arbeiderforbund was {{supported}} by people from individual factories, but the mainly philanthropic activists {{were associated with the}} Liberal Party. However, the strike at Akers Mekaniske had been a failure, as the laborers had returned to work by on 26 Augustwith a 10% pay cut. It soon faced competition from more worker-dominated trade unions, coordinated through the Fagforeningenes Centralkomite. On the political side, a Labour Party was formed in 1887, and from it the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions followed in 1899. The historical role of Det norske Arbeiderforbund, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> was to mark the transition between two kinds of trade unionism; the one dominated by the bourgeois Liberal Party and the one dominated by the socialist Labour Party. The organization became defunct around 1890. The publication Arbeideren was continued, and beginning in 1906, Arbeideren was the party organ of the newly founded Labour Democrats, a non-socialist labour and social reform party associated with the Liberal Party.|$|E
5|$|Duncan {{started the}} 2008–09 season with strong showings in points and rebounds per game. However, by mid-season, his {{performance}} declined {{and he was}} subsequently diagnosed with chronic knee tendinosis. Despite Duncan having problems with his knee and the team losing the services of shooting guard Ginóbili {{for most of the}} season, San Antonio qualified for the playoffs as the third seed with a 54–28 record. Coupled with an aging supporting cast (Bowen, Michael Finley and Kurt Thomas were all in their late 30s), however, the Spurs were only considered fringe contenders for the championship. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> Duncan and Parker were not enough to help the Spurs avoid a 4–1 defeat by Dallas, and the Spurs were eliminated {{in the first round of}} the playoffs for the first time since 2000.|$|E
