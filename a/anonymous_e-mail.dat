500|$|The Daily Stormer orchestrates what {{it calls}} a [...] "Troll Army", {{involved}} in Internet trolling. It came to attention in October 2014 in a campaign against British Labour politician Luciana Berger, a Jewish Member of Parliament. A member of neo-Nazi group National Action {{had been sent to}} prison for sending her abusive messages over Twitter and The Daily Stormer encouraged its readers to send her antisemitic messages, as long as they did not promote violence. It also gave out guidelines on how to limit traceability and create <b>anonymous</b> <b>e-mail</b> and Twitter accounts. Berger said she received 400 abusive messages in one week. The abuse was brought up in the British Parliament, where Speaker John Bercow deemed it [...] "beneath contempt". The Troll Army launched a campaign in February 2015 against Mariam Veiszadeh, an Afghan Australian Muslim activist who demanded that a T-shirt bearing the Australian flag reading [...] "If you don't love it, leave" [...] be withdrawn from sale at Woolworths. [...] A woman was arrested for sending her abusive messages, and Anglin interpreted Veiszadeh's actions as curbing freedom of speech, which he believed [...] "should be responded to with the most ridiculous conceivable hateful speech".|$|E

40|$|Due to {{increasing}} criminal activities by <b>anonymous</b> <b>E-mails</b> in the cyber world, it is a challenging task to extract beneficial knowledge from E-mail systems. This problem in cyber world attracts many researchers in cyber-crime domain. Recent studies {{in this area}} concentrate on traditional classification approaches such as Decision Tree and Support Vector Machines (SVM). These approaches are employed to identify the author. The main goal of these researches is increasing the accuracy of identification, but the quality of evidence is ignored and also {{it is hard to}} be traced. So, in this paper, we propose a new approach based on data mining methods for improving the quality of evidence which leads to boost the accuracy of identification. We use writeprints as the evidence and extract them from each E-mail of individuals. The next step for author identification, is matching the writeprints with <b>anonymous</b> <b>E-mails</b> by applying Earth Mover Distance (EMD) criterion to identify the plausible author. In addition to high accuracy, EMD can help cybercrime investigators in making decision about anonymous intruder. Experiments with real data in both English and Persian languages, demonstrate the proposed approach can effectively identify the author and capture strong evidence to prove the identification. c © 2014 JComSec.

50|$|While {{the basic}} concept was effective, the Penet remailer had several {{vulnerabilities}} which threatened {{the anonymity of}} its users. Chief among them was the need to store a list of real e-mail addresses mapped to the corresponding <b>anonymous</b> <b>e-mail</b> addresses on the server. A potential attacker needed only to access that list to compromise the identities of all of Penet’s users. The Penet remailer was on two occasions required by the legal system in Finland (the country where the Penet server hardware resided) {{to turn over the}} real e-mail address that was mapped to an <b>anonymous</b> <b>e-mail</b> address. Another potential vulnerability was that messages sent to and from the remailer were all sent in cleartext, making it vulnerable to electronic eavesdropping.|$|E

50|$|Copas, {{who never}} {{admitted}} being gay while a soldier, was discharged honorably after an eight-month investigation. The investigation {{was triggered by}} a number of <b>anonymous</b> <b>e-mails</b> accusing Copas of homosexual acts; Copas's battalion commander with the 82nd Airborne at Fort Bragg determined that the evidence was sufficient to discharge Copas despite his denial. The Army claimed that the evidence indicated that Copas had engaged in at least two homosexual affairs while in the service, and that the e-mails had been sent in revenge for the failure of one of these relationships. Copas suggests that the information came from an anonymous informant whom he had met and mistakenly befriended in a chat room.|$|R

40|$|The primary {{intent of}} this thesis is to {{contribute}} to cyber forensics by addressing two important aspects that are processes and analysis techniques. In this thesis, first, the existing proposals of cyber forensic processes are compiled and evaluated according to a priori, well-defined criteria. Beside this evaluation, a new digital forensic process is developed that uses the high potential of the previous proposals and addresses their identified deficiencies. In addition, a new technique of e-mail evidence investigation is presented {{to be used in}} cyber forensics analysis. The proposed technique extensively uses and exploits data mining techniques for answering several important questions that are extremely relevant in a forensic setting, such as e-mail clustering, classification, social network computation and the author identification of <b>anonymous</b> <b>e-mails.</b> Finally, towards this objective, the architecture and the design of an environment are also elaborated that implement the aforementioned technique...|$|R

40|$|Many criminals {{exploit the}} {{convenience}} of anonymity in the cyber world to conduct illegal activities. E-mail is {{the most commonly used}} medium for such activities. Extracting knowledge and information from e-mail text has become an important step for cybercrime investigation and evidence collection. Yet, {{it is one of the}} most challenging and time-consuming tasks due to special characteristics of e-mail dataset. In this paper, we focus on the problem of mining the writing styles from a collection of e-mails written by multiple anonymous authors. The general idea is to first cluster the <b>anonymous</b> <b>e-mails</b> by the stylometric features and then extract the writeprint, i. e., the unique writing style, from each cluster. We emphasize that the presented problem together with our proposed solution is different from the traditional problem of authorship identification, which assumes training data is available for building a classifier. Our proposed method is particularly useful in the initial stage of investigation, in which the investigator usually have very little information of the case and the true authors of suspicious e-mails collection. Experiments on a real-life dataset suggest that clustering by writing style is a promising approach for grouping e-mails written by the same author...|$|R

Aims To examine stress management methods used by OH physicians in Finland. Methods <b>Anonymous,</b> self-administered <b>e-mail</b> questionnaire to Finnish OH physicians. Results A total of 222 OH physicians responded. Neither OH services nor their client organizations used standardized tools to assess or manage work-related stress. Work-related stress was assessed using patient interviews. Physicians reported that the main method used to manage occupational stress was supporting the individual employee. Half of the physicians attempted to involve workplaces in stress management by asking their patients to contact their supervisors regarding stress issues.

40|$|Background: This paper {{aimed to}} use the Delphi {{technique}} to develop a consensus framework for a multinational, workplace walking intervention. Methods: Ideas were gathered and ranked from eight recognized and emerging experts {{in the fields of}} physical activity and health, from universities in Australia, Canada, England, the Netherlands, Northern Ireland, and Spain. Members of the panel were asked to consider the key characteristics of a successful campus walking intervention. Consensus was reached by an inductive, content analytic approach, conducted through an <b>anonymous,</b> three-round, <b>e-mail</b> process. Results: The resulting framework consisted of three interlinking themes defined as "design, implementation, and evaluation. " Top-ranked subitems in these themes included the need to generate research capacity (design), to respond to group needs through different walking approaches (implementation), and to undertake physical activity assessment (evaluation). Themes were set within an underpinning domain, referred to as the "institution" and sites are currently engaging with subitems in this domain, to provide sustainable interventions that reflect the practicalities of local contexts and needs. Conclusions: Findings provide a unique framework for designing, implementing, and evaluating walking projects in universities and highlight the value of adopting the Delphi technique for planning international, multisite health initiatives...|$|R
