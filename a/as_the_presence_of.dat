5|$|Further {{convective}} organization {{occurred as}} the circulation consolidated, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert late on August6. The next day, the agency initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 16W about 780km (485mi) {{east of the}} Philippines island of Luzon. Subsequently, the depression maintained a northward track, due to its location along the northwest periphery of a near-equatorial ridge, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> a tropical upper tropospheric trough. Although the circulation was broad, the winds intensified enough for the JMA to upgrade the depression to Tropical Storm Rananim on August8.|$|E

5|$|The Yomesh cult is the {{official}} religion of Orgoreyn, and worships light. Critics such as David Lake have found parallels between the Yomesh cult and Christianity, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> saints and angels, {{and the use of}} a dating system based on the death of the prophet. Le Guin portrays the Yomesh religion as influencing the Orgota society, which Lake interprets as a critique of the influence of Christianity upon Western society. In comparison to the religion of Karhide, the Yomesh religion focuses more on enlightenment and positive, obvious statements. The novel suggests that this focus on positives leads to the Orgota being not entirely honest, and that a balance between enlightenment and darkness is necessary for truth.|$|E

5|$|As Tropical Storm Dorothy moved {{further into}} the Caribbean Sea, it began a gradual {{weakening}} trend initiated by a persistent tropical upper tropospheric trough, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> strong wind shear {{and a lack of}} inflow. Hurricane Hunter flights late on August21 and early on August22 failed to locate a closed low-level circulation, and as a result the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression. After another flight into the system could not detect a circulation, the NHC discontinued advisories on Dorothy to the south of Hispaniola late on August22. Around the same time, thunderstorms increased in association with the cyclone, and forecasters remarked the potential for re-intensification over the western Caribbean Sea. However, the storm became more disorganized, and on August23 Dorothy degenerated into a tropical wave.|$|E
5|$|From 31 October to 15 November, the Wehrmacht {{high command}} stood down while {{preparing}} {{to launch a}} second offensive towards Moscow. Although Army Group Centre still possessed considerable nominal strength, its fighting capabilities had thoroughly diminished because of combat fatigue. While the Germans {{were aware of the}} continuous influx of Soviet reinforcements from the east as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> large reserves, given the tremendous Soviet casualties, they did not expect the Soviets to be able to mount a determined defense. But in comparison to the situation in October, Soviet rifle divisions occupied a much stronger defensive position: a triple defensive ring surrounding the city and some remnants of the Mozhaisk line near Klin. Most of the Soviet field armies now had a multilayered defense, with at least two rifle divisions in second echelon positions. Artillery support and sapper teams were also concentrated along major roads that German troops were expected to use in their attacks. There were also many Soviet troops still available in reserve armies behind the front. Finally, Soviet troops—and especially officers—were now more experienced and better prepared for the offensive.|$|E

5|$|Rolf Singer's fourth edition (1986) of his {{comprehensive}} Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy included Collybia racemosa {{in section}} Collybia, {{in addition to}} the three species that currently comprise the genus Collybia: C.tuberosa, C.cirrhata and C.cookei. A phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer sequences of ribosomal DNA by Karen Hughes and colleagues showed that C.tuberosa, C.cirrhata and C.cookei form a monophyletic group within a larger Lyophyllum–Tricholoma–Collybia clade that includes several species of Lyophyllum, Tricholoma, Lepista, Hypsizygus and the species C.racemosa. Hughes and colleagues could not identify a clade that included all four species of Collybia. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the ribosomal DNA from the four species corroborated the results obtained from phylogenetic analysis. Based on these results, as well as differences in characteristics such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> unique stem projections, fruit body pigmentation, and macrochemical reactions, they circumscribed the new genus Dendrocollybia to contain C.racemosa.|$|E
5|$|The black elite in {{the towns}} donated to the settlers' {{patriotic}} funds and organisations, and also set up their own. A war fundraising tea organised by black Salisburians in early March 1915 boasted entertainment {{in the form of}} a black choir, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> Taylor and a junior native commissioner, each of whom gave speeches in English, Sindebele and Shona. Rural black people, by contrast, did not generally understand the concept of donating money to war funds, and misinterpreted encouragement to do so as being threatened with a new tax. When the Matabele chief Gambo began collecting war donations from his people in early 1915, also urging other chiefs to do the same, he took care to thoroughly explain the war fund's purpose and the voluntary nature of contributing, but some villagers still misunderstood and came to believe they would have livestock confiscated if they did not give money. The Company ultimately sent officials around the countryside to clarify the matter.|$|E
5|$|The only {{species in}} the genus Pseudoryzomys, its closest living {{relatives}} are the large rats Holochilus and Lundomys, which are semiaquatic, spending {{much of their time}} in the water. The three genera share several characters, including specializations towards a semiaquatic lifestyle, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> membranes between the digits (interdigital webbing), and a reduction in the complexity of the molar crowns, both of which are at incipient stages in Pseudoryzomys. Together, they form a unique assemblage within the oryzomyine tribe, a very diverse group including over one hundred species, mainly in South America. This tribe is part of the subfamily Sigmodontinae and family Cricetidae, which include many more species, mainly from Eurasia and the Americas. Pseudoryzomys simplex was independently described in 1887 on the basis of subfossil cave specimens from Brazil (as Hesperomys simplex); and in 1921 {{on the basis of a}} live specimen from Paraguay (as Oryzomys wavrini). This was confirmed in 1991 that both names pertained to the same species.|$|E

5|$|The patagium is {{the wing}} membrane. The patagium is {{stretched}} between {{the arm and}} hand bones, down the lateral {{side of the body}} and down to the hind limbs. This skin membrane consists of connective tissue, elastic fibers, nerves, muscles, and blood vessels. The muscles keep the membrane taut during flight. The skin on the body of the bat, which has one layer of epidermis and dermis, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> hair follicles, sweat glands and a fatty subcutaneous layer, {{is very different from the}} skin of the wing membrane. The patagium is an extremely thin double layer of epidermis; these layers are separated by a connective tissue center, rich with collagen and elastic fibers. The membrane has no hair follicles or sweat glands, except between the fingers. Unlike birds whose stiff wings deliver bending and torsional stress to the shoulders, bats have a flexible wing membrane which can only resist tension. To achieve flight, a bat exerts force inwards at the points where the membrane meets the skeleton, so that an opposing force balances it on the wing edges perpendicular to the wing surface. However, this adaptation does not permit bats to reduce their wingspan as birds do, which means they cannot travel over long distances like birds can.|$|E
5|$|Though the Indian Navy {{achieved}} significant {{success with}} Operation Trident, its main target, the oil storage facilities in Karachi, were still operational as {{only one of}} the two missiles fired had hit them. This failure was later assessed as the result of confusion created between the commanding officers of the three missile boats. Furthermore, the Indians mistook tracer fire from the coastal artillery of Karachi as originating from Pakistani aircraft, and retreated hurriedly before they could properly target the tanks. After the first attack during Operation Trident on the Port of Karachi, Pakistan stepped up aerial surveillance of its coast <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> large Indian Navy ships gave the impression that another attack was being planned. Pakistani warships attempted to outsmart the Indian Navy by mingling with merchant shipping. To counter these moves, Operation Python was launched.|$|E
5|$|Viruses have {{different}} {{mechanisms by which}} they produce disease in an organism, which depends largely on the viral species. Mechanisms at the cellular level primarily include cell lysis, the breaking open and subsequent death of the cell. In multicellular organisms, if enough cells die, the whole organism will start to suffer the effects. Although viruses cause disruption of healthy homeostasis, resulting in disease, they may exist relatively harmlessly within an organism. An example would include {{the ability of the}} herpes simplex virus, which causes cold sores, to remain in a dormant state within the human body. This is called latency and is a characteristic of the herpes viruses, including Epstein–Barr virus, which causes glandular fever, and varicella zoster virus, which causes chickenpox and shingles. Most people have been infected with {{at least one of these}} types of herpes virus. However, these latent viruses might sometimes be beneficial, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> the virus can increase immunity against bacterial pathogens, such as Yersinia pestis.|$|E
