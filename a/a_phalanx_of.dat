500|$|Although Harper was {{considered}} an intelligent and capable minister by peers and reporters—a 1965 report in The Economist called him [...] "by far the best brain" [...] in the Rhodesian Cabinet—his views were often perceived as overly reactionary. He led <b>a</b> <b>phalanx</b> <b>of</b> far-right voices within the RF calling for [...] "a form of political apartheid" [...] in Rhodesia, and while the party line was gradual advancement of black political representation, Harper called {{not only for the}} cessation of such moves, but for the abolition of black MPs altogether. He thus became something of an obstacle to an Anglo-Rhodesian settlement. Indeed, when Smith brought a working document back from the HMS Tiger talks with Wilson in October 1966, it was Harper who led opposition to the terms in Cabinet, contributing to its ultimate rejection. Harper considered himself to have been overlooked when Smith gave the office of Deputy Prime Minister (which had been vacant since UDI) to the more moderate Wrathall the month before the Tiger conference. The South African newspaper Die Beeld reported in December 1966 that the RF's right wing was poised to oust Smith in favour of Harper, but this did not occur.|$|E

[...] Michele Romero of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a C, saying, [...] "On a few songs, [...] breathy mewl is a pleasant contrast to the mechanical drone of Sugarcube-like techno-tunes. But most of Debut sounds annoyingly like the monotonous plinking of a deranged music box. Wind it up if you like -- eventually it will stop." [...] Debut rated highly in British end of year polls. The NME ranked Debut at number one on their list of [...] "Top 50 LPs of 1993". Melody Maker placed the album at number six on their list of [...] "Albums of the Year for 1993" [...] calling it [...] "a fantastic debut". In 1994, Q included the album on their list for top fifty albums of 1993. Björk reacted to the positive reviews hesitantly, stating that if she'd [...] "delivered exactly the same album and I came from Nottingham, I'd have got completely different reviews, normal down-to-earth ones" [...] and that Debut [...] "was {{a bit of a}} rehearsal and it's really not that good.

2500|$|As time passed, {{more and}} more of a hip-hop {{influence}} crept into go-go. Early MCs like D.C.

As the hip-hop content in go-go increased, the complexity of the musical arrangements decreased.

2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} first London {{performances}} of La Tosca, Francis Burnand and the composer Florian Pascal wrote a musical parody of the play entitled Tra-la-la Tosca or The High-Toned Soprano and the Villain Bass.

The show premiered at London's Royalty Theatre in January 1890 and ran for 45 performances, with the critic Cecil Howard pronouncing it one of Burnand's finest efforts. Burnand had previously parodied Sardou's Féodora as Stage-Doora (1883) and Théodora as The O'Dora (1885), both of which ran at Toole's Theatre in London. In 2004, Lucio Dalla composed an Italian musical, Tosca, Amore Disperato (Tosca, Desperate Love), based largely {{on the structure of}} Puccini's opera, but with elements from Sardou's play.

In the third register, {{a small part of}} a possibly seated figure can be seen. In front of him, a cow is tethered to a pole while a naked priest standing on a pile of dead animal bodies performs a libation ritual on two plants spouting from vases. Left of these scenes is a pile of naked bodies surrounded by skirted workers with baskets on their head.
