40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2013. Includes bibliographical references. In this dissertation, an {{integrated}} simulation code {{has been developed}} to model and characterize the radio wave propagation in these challenging environments. One exemplary environment considered is a hilly area (a realistic radar site) facing the ocean and with slopes and rough/irregular terrain where the radar antennas are located. The integrated method involves three numerical techniques: the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method, the Parabolic Equation (PE) method, and the ray-tracing (RT) method. The {{advantages and disadvantages of}} these methods are examined to identify their best application domain. First, the FDTD method is found suitable to simulate propagation in small regions with possible fine structures present such as the hill with antennas. The FDTD method can accurately characterize the effect of slope and roughness on radio propagation which in turn impacts the phases of the radar array elements and need to be considered in the beam-forming design of a radar or communication system. Second, the PE method is employed for simulating propagation over the flat ocean, land/ocean transition and irregular terrain. This region is defined to be right above the ocean surface and has a small height satisfying the paraxial propagation requirement. For launching PE calculation, the FDTD results on the boundary of its small region near the source are used to serve as the initial field distribution needed by the PE method. This approach provides more accurate PE calculations because the scattered field from the hill is taken into account in the FDTD initial field. Ray-tracing (RT) method is also employed as a third method to calculate field in the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>area</b> above the PE and the FDTD calculations regions. The optimal computation domain of each of these regions is investigated through several numerical comparisons of their respective modeled propagation behavior at the boundaries between and in overlapping regions. In these comparisons both speed and accuracy of propagation factor were considered to optimize the performance of the integrated code. Finally, the integrated method is implemented with the optimal computation domain size for each of these methods. The integrated method employing the PE, the RT, and the FDTD, each in its own computation domain of applicability, has broad application domain in radar and communication application and shows better accuracy than any of the individual methods. The integrated method can handle both vertical and horizontal polarizations. Several experimental measurements were carried out in a land/ocean transition area to verify the simulation of the integrated propagation modeling code and excellent agreement of the field strength was observed...|$|E

40|$|Silicon {{photonics}} is {{a revolutionary}} technology {{that enables the}} control of light inside a silicon chip and holds promise to impact many applications from data center optical interconnects to optical sensing and even quantum optics. The tight confinement of light inside these chips greatly enhances light-matter interactions, making this an ideal platform for nonlinear photonics. Recently, microresonator-based Kerr frequency comb generation has become a prevalent emerging field, enabling the generation of a broadband optical pulse train by inputting a low-power continuous-wave laser into a low-loss chip-scale micro-cavity. These chip-scale combs have {{a wide variety of}} applications, including optical clocks, optical spectroscopy, and data communications. Several important applications in biological, chemical and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>areas</b> require combs generated in the visible and mid-infrared wavelength ranges, where there has been far less research and development compared with the near-infrared. Additionally, most platforms widely for combs are passive, limiting the ability to control and optimize the frequency combs. In this dissertation, we set out to address these shortcomings and introduce new tunability as well as wavelength flexibility in order to enable new applications for microresonator frequency combs. The silicon nitride platform for near-infrared combs is generally a passive platform with limited tuning capabilities. We overcome dispersion limitations in the visible range by leveraging the second-order nonlinearity of silicon nitride and demonstrate visible comb lines. We then further investigate the second-order nonlinearity of silicon nitride by measuring the linear electro-optic effect, a potential tuning mechanism. Finally, we introduce thermal tuning onto the silicon nitride platform and demonstrate tuning of the resonance extinction and dispersion of a micro-cavity using a coupled cavity design. We also address the silicon mid-infrared frequency comb platform. The transparency range of the traditional silicon platform prohibits operation beyond 4 um wavelength. Here we show that a silicon photonics platform can be leveraged for broadband mid-infrared operation without introducing complexity in fabrication. Both an air-clad and fully suspended silicon platform can enable broadband, low-loss propagation and comb generation as high as 6 um. We demonstrate a high quality factor resonator near 4 um wavelength, more than an order of magnitude higher than the traditional platform. Finally, we discuss future avenues of research building on the work presented here...|$|R
