5|$|About {{seven minutes}} after {{stepping}} onto the Moon's surface, Armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick. He then folded the bag <b>and</b> <b>tucked</b> <b>it</b> {{into a pocket}} on his right thigh. This was to guarantee {{there would be some}} lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the EVA and return to the LM.|$|E
60|$|She {{pulled the}} {{covering}} up round his neck <b>and</b> <b>tucked</b> <b>it</b> {{in with her}} strong, rough old hand, whose very tenderness hurt.|$|E
6000|$|As {{she reached}} his side {{he took her}} arm <b>and</b> <b>tucked</b> <b>it</b> within his own. [...] "You might get lost," [...] he said, in jocular {{explanation}} of his action.|$|E
60|$|Letting {{the blind}} up by gentle tugs halfway his {{backward}} eye saw her {{glance at the}} letter <b>and</b> <b>tuck</b> <b>it</b> under her pillow.|$|R
6000|$|CARMODY. It's a great {{wonder you}} didn't forget it--and me without a chew. (He bites {{off a piece}} <b>and</b> <b>tucks</b> <b>it</b> into his cheek.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, now, the {{under-sheet}} {{you must}} bring over the bolster--so, <b>and</b> <b>tuck</b> <b>it</b> right {{down under the}} mattress nice and smooth--so. Do you see?' ...|$|R
60|$|A puff of {{cold wind}} struck {{her face and}} she shivered. Florence noticed her and pulled up the second robe <b>and</b> <b>tucked</b> <b>it</b> closely round her up to her chin.|$|E
60|$|I made {{a hole in}} the prescription, ran {{the cord}} through it, tied it around my neck, <b>and</b> <b>tucked</b> <b>it</b> inside. All of us have a little superstition, and mine runs to a {{confidence}} in amulets.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ole Missus, de {{house is}} plum' jam full o' people, en dey's jes a-spi'lin' to see de gen'lemen!" [...] She {{indicated}} the twins {{with a nod}} of her head, <b>and</b> <b>tucked</b> <b>it</b> back out of sight again.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is the {{one that}} I shall take," [...] said he to the rich man, [...] "and you may have the other." [...] <b>And,</b> <b>tucking</b> <b>it</b> under his arm, off he tramped.|$|R
60|$|Case {{gathered}} up his goods, <b>and,</b> <b>tucking</b> <b>it</b> under his arm, grasped Helen's arm. She {{was leaning against}} the tree, and when he pulled her, she wrenched herself free, rising with difficulty. His disgusting touch and revolting face had revived her sensibilities.|$|R
60|$|She vanishes; and the {{atmosphere}} changes to prosaic daylight. Zoo comes off the railing; throws off her robe; makes a bundle of it; <b>and</b> <b>tucks</b> <b>it</b> under her arm. The magic and mystery are gone. The women rise to their feet. The Envoy's party stare at one another helplessly.|$|R
60|$|It {{was growing}} dusk as Cap'n Bill {{unhooked}} the seats and Button-Bright folded up the umbrella <b>and</b> <b>tucked</b> <b>it</b> under his arm. Trot seized the lunchbasket {{and ran to}} the house, where she found her mother busy in the kitchen.|$|E
60|$|He {{had reached}} the open {{backdoor}} of All Hallows. Stepping into the porch he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket <b>and</b> <b>tucked</b> <b>it</b> again behind the leather headband. Damn it. I might have tried to work M'Coy for a pass to Mullingar.|$|E
60|$|For a {{few moments}} the thrilling, rasping sound was heard; and then the top-man seemed parted in twain at the hip, as the leg slowly slid {{into the arms of}} the pale, gaunt man in the shroud, who at once made away with it, <b>and</b> <b>tucked</b> <b>it</b> out of sight under one of the guns.|$|E
50|$|For {{the second}} row, take the new top left (or top right) warp strand, <b>and</b> <b>tuck</b> <b>it</b> between {{the top and}} bottom, forming a new weft strand. Again, {{interlink}} {{the top and bottom}} rows, making sure to use the old weft strand from row #1. Continue this process until the desired length is completed.|$|R
2500|$|... 4. If {{you are not}} {{sleeping}} in a well-screened or air-conditioned area, use a bed net <b>and</b> <b>tuck</b> <b>it</b> under your mattress. If possible, use a bed net that has been soaked in or sprayed with a pyrethroid-containing insecticide. The same treatment {{can be applied to}} screens, curtains, sheets, and clothing (clothing should be retreated after five washings)." ...|$|R
50|$|Place a {{turn around}} the rope or spar and {{come up to the}} left of the {{standing}} part of the line. Cross over the standing part and make a {{turn around the}} rope or spar in the opposite direction. Finally, pass the working end over the second turn <b>and</b> <b>tuck</b> <b>it</b> under the first turn. Set the knot and tighten the knot.|$|R
60|$|But {{over her}} friend's {{shoulder}} Irene caught {{the expression of}} Agatha Lord--tense, startled, with a gleam of triumph in the dark eyes. It frightened her, that look {{on the face of}} one she had deemed a stranger, and it warned her. She closed the book with a little slam of decision <b>and</b> <b>tucked</b> <b>it</b> beside her in her chair.|$|E
60|$|None {{could lift}} {{their eyes to}} look at Mary; but Inglewood sent a glance along the table at Innocent Smith. He was still bowed above his paper toys, and a wrinkle was on his {{forehead}} {{that might have been}} worry or shame. He carefully plucked out one corner of a complicated paper <b>and</b> <b>tucked</b> <b>it</b> in elsewhere; then the wrinkle vanished and he looked relieved.|$|E
60|$|Upon a great branch where Meriem often swung at {{indolent}} ease he saw Geeka {{propped against}} the tree's great bole. What could it mean? Meriem had never left Geeka thus alone before. Korak picked up the doll <b>and</b> <b>tucked</b> <b>it</b> in his belt. He called again, more loudly; but no Meriem answered his summons. In the distance the jabbering of the excited Manus was growing less distinct.|$|E
50|$|Later, a US patrol find Fujita's body. One Marine officer finds Kuribayashi's pistol <b>and</b> <b>tucks</b> <b>it</b> {{under his}} belt. They search {{the area and}} find Saigo with his shovel. Seeing the pistol in the Marine lieutenant's belt, Saigo becomes furious and attacks the Americans with his shovel. Too weak to fight, he is knocked {{unconscious}} and taken to the POW beach. Awakening on a stretcher, he glimpses the setting sun and smiles grimly.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Campbells are coming, {{thick and}} fast this morning, {{and the more}} the merrier," [...] she said, running to meet him. [...] "You look like a good boy going to school, and virtuously conning your lesson by the way," [...] she added, smiling to see him take his finger out of the book he had evidently been reading, <b>and</b> <b>tuck</b> <b>it</b> under his arm, just {{as he used to}} do years ago.|$|R
6000|$|... "That he did; <b>and</b> he <b>tuck</b> <b>it</b> so {{hard that}} {{everybody}} allows the two sermons he preached the next Sabba' day {{to be the very}} two worst he ever did preach." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the bosom}} of her dress she felt the sharp edge of the paper left for her by Desiree Candeille among the roses in the park. She had picked it up almost {{mechanically}} then, <b>and</b> <b>tucked</b> <b>it</b> away, hardly heeding what she was doing. Whatever the motive of the French actress had been in placing the passport at her disposal, Marguerite blessed her in her heart for it. To the woman she had mistrusted, she would owe the last supreme happiness of her life.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stay, my {{petticoat}} is warmer," [...] cried Alice, hastily divesting {{herself of}} a flannel garment of bright scarlet, the brilliant beauty {{of which had}} long been the admiration of {{the entire population of}} Sandy Cove. The child spread it over the seaman's chest, <b>and</b> <b>tucked</b> <b>it</b> carefully down at his sides, between his body and the wet garments. Then the three sat down beside him, and, each seizing a limb, began to rub and chafe with a degree of energy that nothing could resist! At any rate it put life into John Bumpus, for that hardy mariner gradually began to exhibit signs of returning vitality.|$|E
6000|$|Josie {{expected}} momentarily to be interrupted, so she conducted {{her search}} {{as rapidly as}} was consistent with thoroughness. She {{paid no attention to}} the card scraps but all papers she smoothed out, one by one. Finally, with a little cry of triumph, she thrust one of these into her handbag. She made this discovery just back of the press, and glancing up, she noted a hook that had formerly been hidden from her view, on which were impaled a number of papers--the chef's [...] "copy" [...] from which various bills had been printed. Running through these papers she suddenly paused, pulled one away from the hook <b>and</b> <b>tucked</b> <b>it</b> into her bag.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have two}} {{blankets}} here," [...] he said, as {{he removed the}} covering. [...] "One of these I will put over you both, <b>and</b> <b>tuck</b> <b>it</b> well in, each side, {{to keep out the}} wind that comes in between the stones. Then I will lay your smocks over that. I wrung them well, before putting them on the sticks; and although I cannot say they are dry, yet they are not damp enough to matter, and will help keep you warm. The other blanket I will put over the sticks." ...|$|R
50|$|The book then {{switches}} {{to a letter}} from Jaimy to Jacky. The letter is not written down, but rather in his head. Jaimy {{and the others are}} on the ship Cerberus. Every day, the convicts are allowed on deck for some exercise and fresh air. Jaimy plans a riot. Ian and Arthur create a diversion by singing a song about some of the guards. The two guards, Corporal Vance and Sergeant Napper, are enraged and begin beating some of the convicts. This diversion allows Jaimy to grab a belaying pin from the deck <b>and</b> <b>tuck</b> <b>it</b> under his clothes.|$|R
50|$|Sun Wukong {{establishes}} {{himself as}} a powerful and influential demon. In search of a weapon, he travels to the oceans and acquires the Golden-banded staff Ruyi Jingu Bang(如意金箍棒), a treasure of Ao Kuang, the dragon-king of the Eastern Seas. Upon Sun Wukong's approach, the staff glows to signify it has found its true master. It can change its size, multiply, and fight according to its master's whim. It weighs 13,500 jin (8.1 tons). When not wielding the weapon, Sun Wukong shrinks {{it down to the}} size of a sewing needle <b>and</b> <b>tucks</b> <b>it</b> behind his ear.|$|R
60|$|He {{put some}} more coals {{on the fire}} so {{that there should be}} a cheerful blaze when he came in to tea, and went into the drawing-room. He {{loosened}} his collar, arranged the cushions, and settled himself comfortably on the sofa. But thinking the drawing-room a little chilly, Mrs. Carey brought him a rug from the hall; she put it over his legs <b>and</b> <b>tucked</b> <b>it</b> round his feet. She drew the blinds so that the light should not offend his eyes, and since he had closed them already went out of the room on tiptoe. The Vicar was at peace with himself today, and in ten minutes he was asleep. He snored softly.|$|E
60|$|For a {{long time}} he lay {{watching}} and listening. He moved about, making more noise than necessary, yet Tarzan did not awaken. He drew the sacrificial knife from his belt, and plunged it into the ground. Tarzan did not move. Cautiously the Belgian pushed the blade downward through the loose earth above the pouch. He felt the point touch the soft, tough fabric of the leather. Then he pried down upon the handle. Slowly the little mound of loose earth rose and parted. An instant later {{a corner of the}} pouch came into view. Werper pulled it from its hiding place, <b>and</b> <b>tucked</b> <b>it</b> in his shirt. Then he refilled the hole and pressed the dirt carefully down as it had been before.|$|E
60|$|Directly {{the door}} had closed on the Bad One the boy ran in, pulled down a bag of gold from the beam, <b>and</b> <b>tucked</b> <b>it</b> under his left arm. Next he {{unhooked}} the little bridge and put it under his right. He {{did not try to}} escape, as most boys of his age would have done, for the wisdom put into his mind by the good spirits taught him that before he could reach the river and make use of the bridge the Bad One would have tracked him by his footsteps and been upon him. So, making himself very small and thin, he hid himself behind a pile of buffalo skins in the corner, first tearing a slit through one of them, so that he could see what was going on.|$|E
50|$|Tinissa wayfoongi is a moth of the Tineidae family. It was {{described}} by Robinson <b>and</b> <b>Tuck</b> in 1998. <b>It</b> is found in Brunei.|$|R
60|$|Among other things, he {{was amused}} {{with an odd}} {{instance}} of the African love of bright colors and fine shows, in the black's informally taking from the flag-locker a great piece of bunting of all hues, <b>and</b> lavishly <b>tucking</b> <b>it</b> under his master's chin for an apron.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's no {{duplicate}} {{of it in}} the world," [...] he said, [...] "else it would have come to old Max M'Leod;" [...] <b>and</b> he <b>tucked</b> <b>it</b> into the motor. Miss M'Leod {{on the far side of}} the car whispered, [...] "Have you found out anything, Mr. Perseus?" ...|$|R
