Marine mammals that live in coastal environments <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> affected by habitat degradation and loss. Developments such as sewage marine outfalls, moorings, dredging, blasting, dumping, port construction, hydroelectric projects, and aquaculture both degrade the environment and take up valuable habitat. For example, extensive shellfish aquaculture takes up valuable space used by coastal marine mammals for important activities such as breeding, foraging and resting.|$|E

5|$|Strokes {{that occur}} in the {{brainstem}} may cause profound deficits, including locked-in syndrome, in which cognitive, emotional and linguistic abilities remain intact but all or almost all voluntary motor abilities are lost. Most people affected by this type of stroke rely on AAC strategies to communicate, since few recover intelligible speech or functional voice. The AAC strategies used vary with the individual's preferences and motor capabilities which may change over time. As eye movements <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> preserved, eye blinks are frequently used for communication. Low-tech alphabet boards are often introduced immediately to provide the individual with basic communication. Partner-assisted scanning may be used, in which the AAC user signals when the desired letter is named by a communication partner. When vertical and horizontal eye movements are functional, a transparent alphabet board may be used in which the AAC user looks at the desired letter and this is acknowledged by the communication partner. Individuals with locked-in syndrome have difficulty using high-tech devices due to issues with motor control, vision, memory, alertness and linguistic ability. In particular, a voluntary, reliable and easily controlled muscle movement is necessary to access such a device, such as head, jaw, hand or finger movements. In some individuals, intensive practice, even long after the initial stroke, has been shown to increase the accuracy and consistency of head movements, which can be used to access a communication device.|$|E

25|$|Effective 14 January 2013, Cuba {{ended the}} {{requirement}} established in 1961, that any citizens {{who wish to}} travel abroad were required to obtain an expensive government permit and a letter of invitation. In 1961 the Cuban government had imposed broad restrictions on travel to prevent the mass emigration of people after the 1959 revolution; it approved exit visas only on rare occasions. Requirements were simplified: Cubans need only a passport and a national ID card to leave; and {{they are allowed to}} take their young children with them for the first time.

25|$|Functional {{breast-feeding}} difficulties {{arise if}} the surgeon cut the milk ducts or the major nerves innervating the breast, {{or if the}} milk glands were otherwise damaged. Milk duct and nerve damage are more common if the incisions cut tissue near the nipple. The milk glands <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> affected by subglandular implants (under the gland), and by large-sized breast implants, which pinch the lactiferous ducts and impede milk flow. Small-sized breast implants, and submuscular implantation, cause fewer breast-function problems; however, {{it is impossible to}} predict whether a woman who undergoes breast augmentation will be able to successfully breast feed since some women are able to breast-fed after periareolarincisions and subglandular placement and some are not able to after augmentation using submuscular and other types of surgical incisions.|$|E
25|$|China has {{increasingly}} encouraged multinational corporations to create R centers in China.

In 2010 there were 1,200 such R centers and 400 out the Fortune 500 corporations had created such R centers. Corporations have argued that this is a necessity in order to adapt products for the local requirements of the Chinese market as well as it being essential for maintaining global competitiveness to make use the many available Chinese engineers and scientists.

25|$|Infertility is {{the main}} reason parents seek to adopt {{children}} they are not related to. One study shows this accounted for 80% of unrelated infant adoptions and half of adoptions through foster care. Estimates suggest that 11–24% of Americans who cannot conceive or carry to term attempt to build a family through adoption, and that the overall rate of ever-married American women who adopt is about 1.4%. Other reasons people adopt are numerous although not well documented. These may include wanting to cement a new family following divorce or death of one parent, compassion motivated by religious or philosophical conviction, to avoid contributing to overpopulation out of the belief that it is more responsible to care for otherwise parent-less children than to reproduce, to ensure that inheritable diseases (e.g., Tay-Sachs disease) are not passed on, and health concerns relating to pregnancy and childbirth. Although there are a range of possible reasons, the most recent study of experiences of women who adopt suggests they <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 40–44 years of age, currently married, have impaired fertility, and childless.|$|E

25|$|Social {{parasitism}} is {{a strategy}} in which one social species depends on a different social species to rear its offspring. This is a common occurrence in eusocial insects, including the Vespula genus. Vespula austriaca is a known obligate, permanent social parasite of V. acadica. V. austriaca use the host nest of V. acadica to raise its worker caste, resulting in a mixed colony of parasite and host workers. Eventually, the parasite queen will become the sole reproductive head, and her workers will outnumber the host workers, until the colony is exclusively {{made up of the}} parasitic species. During the queen nest stage, V. acadica queens are able to defend her nests from these parasites. Discoveries of dead queens in the entrance tunnels of colonies indicate that resident queens are very aggressive towards potential usurpers and are likely to kill in order to defend their colony. However, after worker emergence the queen was less vigorous in her defense of the nest, and parasites were more likely to successfully usurp the colony. Colonies <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> usurped when there are 20–40 workers because the worker force is large enough to allow for a maximum output of parasite reproduction but not so large as to provide a strong defense against usurpation.|$|E
500|$|In winter, seed {{resources}} <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a key limiting factor. At {{this time}} of year, individuals in a flock form linear dominance hierarchies, {{but there is no}} strong relation between the size of the throat patch and position in that hierarchy. This is in contrast to the house sparrow; in that species, fights to establish dominance are reduced by the display of the throat patch, the size of which acts as a signalling [...] "badge" [...] of fitness. [...] Although there is evidence that the black throat patch of male, but not female, tree sparrows predicts fighting success in foraging flocks.|$|E
500|$|Because {{studies have}} shown that the golden-crowned sifaka <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found in large forest {{fragments}} (greater than [...] ), the species is thought to be sensitive to forest fragmentation and degradation. [...] However, since it has been found around gold mining camps and degraded forests, it is not restricted to undisturbed forests and appears to tolerate human activity. [...] Regardless, with its low population, highly restricted range, and badly fragmented habitat, the prospect for survival for the golden-crowned sifaka is considered bleak. [...] For these reasons, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) added it to its list of the 25 most endangered primates in 2000. [...] Previously, in 1992, the IUCN's Species Survival Commission (IUCN/SSC) Primate Specialist Group also assigned the species its highest priority rating. [...] As of its 2014 assessment, the golden-crowned sifaka is once again [...] "Critically Endangered" [...] on the IUCN Red List. This was an upgrade from 2008 when it was listed as Endangered. In previous assessments it was listed as Critically Endangered (1996 and 2000) and Endangered (1990 and 1994).|$|E
