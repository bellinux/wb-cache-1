40|$|The optimum {{conditions}} for antigen-induced release of histamine in the rat IgE and IgGa antibody-mediated systems were studied in vitro. The IgE antibody-mediated reaction could be separated into two steps: preparation of target cells with antibody and challenge with antigen. The optimal {{conditions for}} these two steps were distinctly different. Release of histamine by IgGa antibody and antigen could not be separated into two steps, and the optimal conditions for the total reaction were identical {{to those of the}} antigen challenge step of the IgE <b>antibody-mediated</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E
40|$|The plant {{flavonoid}} baohuoside- 1 (B- 1), {{isolated from}} Epimedium davidii, {{was shown to}} suppress antibody and delayed-type hypersensitivity responses in mice in a dose-dependent fashion. By contrast, similar dosage schedules of B- 1 did not significantly prolong survival of cardiac grafts. Furthermore, B- 1 did not potentiate {{the effects of the}} standard anti-rejection drug cyclosporine. Assessment; of the mice for appearance, behaviour, biochemistry, haematology and histology revealed no toxic effects at the dosages used in the experiments. These results indicate that the immunosuppressive properties of B- 1 are confined to the <b>antibody-mediated</b> <b>system,</b> and suggest that B- 1 may be of value in the treatment of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases in which autoantibodies have a major role in pathogenesis...|$|E
40|$|During Salmonella Typhimurium {{infection}} intestinal CX 3 CR 1 + {{cells can}} either extend transepithelial cellular processes to sample luminal bacteria or, very early after infection migrate into the intestinal lumen to capture bacteria. However, up to date, the biological {{relevance of the}} intraluminal migration of CX 3 CR 1 + cells remained to be determined. We addressed this by {{using a combination of}} mouse strains differing in their ability to carry out CX 3 CR 1 -mediated sampling and intraluminal migration. We observed that, the number of S. Typhimurium traversing the epithelium did not differ between sampling-competent/migration-competent C 57 BL/ 6 and samplingdeficient/ migration-competent Balb/c mice. By contrast, in samplingdeficient/ migration-deficient CX 3 CR 1 -/- mice the numbers of S. Typhimurium penetrating the epithelium were significantly higher. However, in these mice the number of invading S. Typhimurium was significantly reduced after the adoptive transfer of CX 3 CR 1 + cells directly into the intestinal lumen, consistent with intraluminal CX 3 CR 1 + cells preventing S. Typhimurium from infecting the host. This interpretation was also supported by a higher bacterial faecal load in CX 3 CR 1 +/gfp compared to CX 3 CR 1 gfp/gfp mice following oral infection. Furthermore, by using real time in vivo imaging we observed that CX 3 CR 1 + cells migrated into the lumen moving through paracellular channels within the epithelium. Also, we reported that the absence of CX 3 CR 1 -mediated sampling did not affect antibody responses to a non-invasive S. Typhimurium strain that specifically targeted the CX 3 CR 1 -mediated entry route. These data showed that the rapidly deployed CX 3 CR 1 + cell-based mechanism of immune-exclusion is a defence mechanism against pathogens that complements the mucous and secretory (s) IgA <b>antibody-mediated</b> <b>system</b> in the protection of intestinal mucosal surface...|$|E
40|$|The existence, {{in several}} species, {{of two major}} types of homocytotropic {{antibodies}} has been recognized and reviewed previously (1). In the preceding paper (2) conditions were described for studying in vitro the antigen-induced release of histamine in the rat IgE and IgGa <b>antibody-mediated</b> <b>systems.</b> The present paper further characterizes {{the properties of the}} IgGa antibodymediated reaction and presents evidence that homologous IgGa and IgE antibodies utilize the same cellular receptors in the pathway leading to the release of histamine. Materials and Methods The media, antigen, and antibody preparations used in this study were the same as those previously described (2). Except where specifically indicated, the conditions of the experiments were those found to yield optimum results in the previous study (2) ...|$|R
40|$|When {{antibody}} binds {{to target}} cell antigens alterations {{occur in the}} Fc portion of the immunoglobulin molecule {{which can lead to}} activation of various immunological effector mechanisms, e. g. the complement (C) system or cytotoxic effector cells. The activation of such effector mechanisms can be used for assaying antibody activity. C-dependent antibody assays have been widely used but often suffer from low reproducibility and may give different results with different sources of C. Cell-dependent antibody-mediated cytotoxicity (1, 2) {{has proven to be a}} powerful assay for antibody in some systems (3). However, the interaction of lymphoid cells with antibody-coated target cells does not always result in target cell lysis. For example, human peripheral blood leukocytes lyse alloantibodycoated human lymphocytes with great sensitivity (4, 5). In contrast, mouse spleen cells, which are a good source of effector cells I in some xenogeneic systems (6 - 9) do not lyse alloantibody-coated mouse lymphocytes (P. Halloran, unpublished data; I. C. M. Maclennan and I. MacKenzie, personal communications). Reasons for these striking species differences are at present unknown, but these findings imply that the induction of target cell lysis in cell-dependent <b>antibody-mediated</b> <b>systems</b> cannot be generally used to detect antitarget cell antibody. In the present series we describe a new widely applicable assay for antibody which is based on inhibition rather than induction of cell-dependent antibodymediated cytotoxicity. The cytotoxicity test system consists of (a) normal mous...|$|R
40|$|Contrary to {{established}} wisdom, there now {{appear to be}} <b>antibody-mediated</b> central nervous <b>system</b> (CNS) disorders. Over the last few years, a number of patients have been defined with antibodies to voltage-gated (VGKC) or ligand-gated (NMDAR, GlyR) ion channels or ungated water (AQP 4) channels. Some of the disorders improve spontaneously over time, others may be more chronic and relapsing-remitting, but immunotherapies reduce antibody levels and improve clinical outcomes. These are exciting developments that herald {{a new era of}} immunotherapy-responsive CNS diseases, and they raise interesting questions regarding the aetiological and pathogenic mechanisms mediating these conditions...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, autoantibodies {{targeting}} proteins on the neuronal surface {{and that are}} believed to be directly pathogenic have been described in patients with autoimmune encephalitis. Since then, new antigenic targets have been discovered, and new clinical phenotypes have been recognized. The psychotic disorders are one example of this expanding spectrum. Here, we consider the defining criteria of <b>antibody-mediated</b> central nervous <b>system</b> disease {{and the extent to which}} the psychiatric data currently satisfy those criteria.

40|$|Background: Autoimmune {{encephalitis}} (AE) {{occurs in}} response to an <b>antibody-mediated</b> central nervous <b>system</b> disease and can lead to significant neurodisability. Prior research on family adjustment has described a reciprocal relationship between caregiver functioning, distress and clinical outcome in parents and children with encephalitis. There has been no previous research exploring the experiences of caregivers with a child with AE. Aims: To explore the perspectives of parents and/or caregivers with a child diagnosed with AE regarding (i) their own adjustment from hospital admission to post-discharge, and (ii) their experiences of care and service provision. Methods: A purposive sampling approach was used. Five parents of children with AE participated in a semi-structured interview exploring their experiences of caring for their child and service provision during acute care and post-discharge. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was used to analyse the transcripts. Main findings and conclusions: Four shared super-ordinate themes with related subthemes emerged: (a) uncertainty, (b) managing our recovery, (c) changes in my child, (d) experiences of service provision. Participants reported emotional distress, often underpinned by recurrent experiences of uncertainty, and ‘loss’ of the previous child, and mediated by coping strategies and social support. While an overall positive experience of inpatient services was reported, parents often perceived post-discharge services as lacking in co-ordination, communication and formal follow-up, resulting in unmet support needs. Implications and recommendations for services, practitioners and future research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Molecular Communication (MC) {{is a new}} {{paradigm}} in communication research where the exchange of information is achieved through the propagation of molecules. The objective of the proposed research is to develop an analytical framework for the modeling, performance analysis, and optimization of Drug Delivery Systems (DDS’s) through the MC paradigm. The goal of a DDS {{is to provide a}} localized drug presence where the medication is needed, while, at the same time, preventing the drug from affecting other healthy parts of the body. Amongst others, the most advanced solutions use drugs composed of nano-sized particles for Particulate Drug Delivery Systems (PDDS) or antibody fragments for <b>Antibody-mediated</b> Drug Delivery <b>Systems</b> (ADDS). In this work, first, a fundamental analytical model of the drug particle propagation through the cardiovascular system is presented, comprised of the blood velocity network, using transmission line theory, and the drug propagation network, using harmonic matrices theory. The outcomes of the analytical model are validated by comparing them with physiological measurements as well as comprehensive simulations of drug propagation in the cardiovascular system using COMSOL finite-element simulations and kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations. Second, the MC-PDDS pharmacokinetic model is developed by taking into account the biochemical interactions between the nanoparticles and the body. The performance and optimization of the MC-PDDS is studied through delay, path loss, noise, and capacity. Third, the MC-ADDS model is derived to capture the peculiarities of antibody-antigen transport and interactions. The effect of the shape and electrochemical structure of the ADDS molecules is reflected on the delay, path loss, and noise. The MC-DDS system modeling is shown to be a full-fledged framework for the design and optimization of targeted DDS and other biomedical engineering applications. Ph. D...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess, at the European level and using digital technology, the inter-pathologist {{reproducibility}} of the ISHLT 2004 system and to compare it with the 1990 system We also assessed the reproducibility of the morphologic criteria for diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection detailed in the 2004 grading system. METHODS: The hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections of 20 sets of endomyocardial biopsies were pre-selected and graded by two pathologists (A. A. and M. B.) and digitized using a telepathology digital pathology system (Aperio ImageScope System; for details refer to [URL] Their diagnoses were considered the index diagnoses, which covered all grades of acute cellular rejection (ACR), early ischemic lesions, Quilty lesions, late ischemic lesions and (in the 2005 <b>system)</b> <b>antibody-mediated</b> rejection (AMR). Eighteen pathologists from 16 heart transplant centers in 7 European countries participated in the study. Inter-observer reproducibility was assessed using Fleiss's kappa and Krippendorff's alpha statistics. RESULTS: The combined kappa value of all grades diagnosed by all 18 pathologists was 0. 31 for the 1990 grading system and 0. 39 for the 2005 grading system, with alpha statistics at 0. 57 and 0. 55, respectively. Kappa values by grade for 1990 / 2005, respectively, were: 0 = 0. 52 / 0. 51; 1 A/ 1 R = 0. 24 / 0. 36; 1 B = 0. 15; 2 = 0. 13; 3 A/ 2 R = 0. 29 / 0. 29; 3 B/ 3 R = 0. 13 / 0. 23; and 4 = 0. 18. For the 2 cases of AMR, 6 of 18 pathologists correctly suspected AMR on the hematoxylin-eosin slides, whereas, in each of 17 of the 18 AMR-negative cases a small percentage of pathologists (range 5 % to 33 %) overinterpreted the findings as suggestive for AMR. CONCLUSIONS: Reproducibility studies of cardiac biopsies by pathologists in different centers at the international level were feasible using digitized slides rather than conventional histology glass slides. There was a small improvement in interobserver agreement between pathologists of different European centers when moving from the 1990 ISHLT classification to the "new" 2005 ISHLT classification. Morphologic suspicion of AMR in the 2004 system on hematoxylin-eosin-stained slides only was poor, highlighting the need for better standardization of morphologic criteria for AMR. Ongoing educational programs are needed to ensure standardization of diagnosis of both acute cellular and antibody-mediated rejection...|$|R
