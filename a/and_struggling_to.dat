25|$|The character's {{original}} 1960s animated appearances left {{a lasting}} impression, meaning Aquaman is widely recognized in popular culture. Jokes about his wholesome portrayal in Super Friends and perceived weaker powers and abilities have been staples of comedy programs and stand-up routines, leading DC at {{several times to}} attempt to make the character edgier or more powerful in comic books. Modern comic book depictions have attempted to reconcile these various aspects of his public perception, casting Aquaman as serious and brooding, saddled with an ill reputation, <b>and</b> <b>struggling</b> <b>to</b> find a true role and purpose beyond his public side as a deposed king and a fallen hero.|$|E

25|$|After {{representing}} Australia at Under-19 {{level and}} making his ODI debut in 2002 {{at the age}} of 20, Hauritz made his Test debut in 2004 in India, where he turned out a credible performance. Upon his return to Australia, however, his form at first class level did not live up to expectations and as a result he found himself out of the Australian side <b>and</b> <b>struggling</b> <b>to</b> hold a place in the Queensland side. As a result, he switched to playing State cricket for New South Wales in the 2006–07 season.

500|$|Critics {{praised the}} Citroën C3 Picasso in reviews for its ergonomics, Bauhaus-inspired styling, {{ease of use}} {{and the amount of}} space offered.

500|$|Potter and Quarshie are {{the only}} regular Holby City cast members who appear in the episode.

He expanded that in leaving Holby, Ric aimed to escape [...] "the politics and stresses in his own life", stating: [...] "It's somewhere he can recharge himself by getting back to uncomplicated medicine.

500|$|The Red Sea {{campaign}} of 1801 {{was intended to}} complement the British invasion of French-held Egypt from the Mediterranean, which went ahead in March 1801. [...] Initial operations were trusted to Blankett at Jeddah, who was in poor health <b>and</b> <b>struggling</b> <b>to</b> negotiate with Ghalib Efendi bin Musa'ed, Sharif of Mecca. These problems were compounded when Forte was wrecked entering the port. Blankett's forces landed unopposed at Suez on 22 March, the French having withdrawn their forces in Southern Egypt to oppose the Mediterranean landings. His mission complete, Blankett withdrew in June after sending 300 soldiers to join the conflict in Northern Egypt, and met with a large reinforcement squadron under Captain Sir Home Popham off Qusayr. An army under General David Baird then took passage up the Nile, but did not arrive before the campaign ended with the Capitulation of Alexandria in August.|$|E
