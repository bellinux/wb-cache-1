40|$|This {{study is}} a sociolinguistic study about request made by <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female {{employer}} to the <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employees <b>and</b> also <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employees to <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employers. The writer is interested in investigating request since request can be used differently by both employers and employees. She also wants to know the types of request used by the <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employer to the <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employees <b>and</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employees to <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employers. The writer used Ervin-Tripp?s theory of request as the main theory to classify the types of request. To find {{the most frequently used}} types of request used by both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employers <b>and</b> both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employees, the writer used descriptive quantitative approach. The writer found that both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employers mostly used the same types of request expressions to both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employees. However, the writer found various types of request used by both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employees to both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employers. The result of this research showed that both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employers mostly used bald imperatives as their types of request, both to their <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employees. However, both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employees used various types of request, both to <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employer. Thus, the result might prove that the social status and gender may have influenced the types of request made by both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employers <b>and</b> both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employees...|$|R
5|$|Note {{that the}} overall size and crest size also {{corresponds}} to age. Immature specimens are known from both females <b>and</b> <b>males,</b> and immature males often have small crests similar to adult females. Therefore, {{it seems that the}} large crests only developed in males when they reached their large, adult size, making the sex of immature specimens difficult to establish from partial remains.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of age, TBI {{rates are}} higher in males. Men suffer {{twice as many}} TBIs as women do and have a {{fourfold}} risk of fatal head injury, <b>and</b> <b>males</b> account for two thirds of childhood and adolescent head trauma. However, when matched for severity of injury, women appear to fare more poorly than men.|$|E
5|$|The calf nurses {{for three}} years, {{although}} lactation usually lasts longer, allowing for extensive mother-calf bonds. Short-finned pilot whale females will go though menopause, {{but this is}} not as common in females of long-finned pilot whales. Postreproductive females possibly play important roles in the survival of the young. Postreproductive females will continue to lactate and nurse young. Since they can no longer bear young of their own, these females invest in the current young. Short-finned pilot whales grow more slowly than long-finned pilot whales. For the short-finned pilot whale, females become sexually mature at 9 years old <b>and</b> <b>males</b> at about 13–16 years. For the long-finned pilot whale, females reach maturity at around eight years <b>and</b> <b>males</b> at around 12 years.|$|E

5|$|A {{conflict}} between the sexes of a species is seen in some species of ants with these reproducers apparently competing to produce offspring that are as closely related to them as possible. The most extreme form involves the production of clonal offspring. An extreme of sexual conflict is seen in Wasmannia auropunctata, where the queens produce diploid daughters by thelytokous parthenogenesis <b>and</b> <b>males</b> produce clones by a process whereby a diploid egg loses its maternal contribution to produce haploid males who are clones of the father.|$|E
5|$|A fold of semi-wild Highland cattle was studied, over {{a period}} of 4 years. It was found that the cattle have a clear {{structure}} and hierarchy of dominance, which reduced aggression. Social standing depended on age and sex, with older cattle being dominant to calves and younger ones <b>and</b> <b>males</b> dominant to females. Young bulls would dominate adult cows when they reached around 2 years of age. Calves from the top ranking cow were given higher social status, despite minimal intervention from their mother. Playfighting, licking and mounting were seen as friendly contact.|$|E

5|$|A {{prominent}} predator is the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) that {{eats the}} virgin queens during nuptial flight {{due to their}} high percentage of fat. Echidnas do not consume Iridomyrmex ants all year; instead, they usually attack nests during August to October, which is when the winged females <b>and</b> <b>males,</b> known as alates emerge from their nest. Queens will also face more threats during nuptial flight or after; birds such as currawongs, magpies and ravens, attracted by recently excavated soil, will dig out nests shortly after the queens have founded their colonies. Parasitic flatworms in the class Cestoda are known to infect Iridomyrmex.|$|E
5|$|A {{study from}} 2008 {{indicates}} that sexual dimorphism occurs early during this species' ontogeny. L.canarium males reach sexual maturity at a shorter shell length {{when compared to}} females. Individuals {{are considered to be}} adult by the time the outer lip of their shell is noticeably thickened and flared; growth to adult size takes about a year. The maximum life span of the dog conch differs between sexes; it is estimated at 2 and 2.5 years for females <b>and</b> <b>males,</b> respectively.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the species}} is {{primarily}} fossorial, it occasionally gathers food near the entrance of a tunnel. Dandelions seem to be its favorite food, and are also used as nesting material. During breeding season males will enter the tunnels of females, <b>and</b> <b>males</b> and females may make purring (or cooing) sounds when they are together. Mothers seem to comfort the young by softly vocalizing, with the young twittering in response.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} lion, the cheetah {{is the only}} cat that is gregarious; however, female cheetahs tend to remain solitary. Tim Caro, of the University of California, Davis, {{identified}} the various social classes and their longevity. Pregnant and nursing females, a few adolescents, <b>and</b> <b>males</b> who have not joined any groups are typically solitary. Non-lactating females, their cubs, adolescent siblings, and several males will form their own groups. A loose association between individuals {{of the opposite sex}} can be observed during the breeding season. These social groups typically keep away from one another.|$|E

Of them, wrestling was almost {{exclusively}} male with only one female, Rabab Eid, taking part. The sport with the most Egyptian female participation was synchronized swimming, an all-woman tournament at the Olympics, with eight, while the nation sent six women to fencing, the highest amount for a mixed sport.

5|$|Blue {{wildebeest}} {{have both}} migratory and sedentary populations. In the Ngorongoro most animals are sedentary <b>and</b> <b>males</b> maintain {{a network of}} territories throughout the year, even though breeding is seasonal in nature. Females and young form groups of about ten individuals or join together in larger aggregations, and non-territorial males form bachelor groups. In the Serengeti and Tarangire ecosystems, populations are mostly migratory, with herds consisting of both sexes frequently moving, but resident subpopulations also exist. During the rutting season, the males may form temporary territories {{for a few hours}} or a day or so, and attempt to gather together a few females with which to mate, but soon they have to move on, often moving ahead to set up another temporary territory.|$|E
40|$|The {{transmission}} of malaria parasites {{depends on the}} presence of sexual stages (gametocytes) in the blood, making the ratio and densities of female <b>and</b> <b>male</b> gametocytes important determinants of parasite fitness. This manuscript describes the development of reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays to separately quantify mature female <b>and</b> <b>male</b> gametocytes of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and reveals that Pfs 25 mRNA is expressed only in female gametocytes. The female (Pfs 25) <b>and</b> <b>male</b> (Pfs 230 p) gametocyte specific RT-qPCR assays have lower detection limits of 0. 3 female <b>and</b> 1. 8 <b>male</b> gametocytes per microlitre of blood, respectively, making them more sensitive than microscopy. Accurate quantification of the ratio and densities of female <b>and</b> <b>male</b> gametocytes will increase understanding of P. falciparum transmission and improve the evaluation of transmission blocking interventions...|$|R

5|$|Despite having dark plumage in a {{tropical}} climate, frigatebirds have found ways not to overheat—particularly {{as they are}} exposed to full sunlight when on the nest. They ruffle feathers to lift them away from the skin and improve air circulation, and can extend and upturn their wings to expose the hot undersurface to the air and lose heat by evaporation and convection. Frigatebirds also place their heads in the shade of their wings, <b>and</b> <b>males</b> frequently flutter their gular pouches.|$|E
50|$|Different {{combinations}} {{of the genes}} present in a Silene Y chromosome affect the sexual expression in the organism. For example, there are two genetic variations {{that can lead to}} male sterility in S. latifolia: if it possesses two Y chromosomes (YY) or if the Y chromosome possesses the female suppression <b>and</b> <b>male</b> promoting genes. Silene are also susceptible to a type of sexually transmitted infection that causes sterility. Another possible combination includes the presence of all three sex-linked genes (male suppressing, female suppressing, <b>and</b> <b>male</b> promoting) which produce virile male offspring. The flower is hermaphrodite when both <b>male</b> promoting <b>and</b> <b>male</b> fertility genes are present. Lastly, Y chromosomes carrying both female suppression <b>and</b> <b>male</b> fertility genes creates an asexual organism.|$|R
