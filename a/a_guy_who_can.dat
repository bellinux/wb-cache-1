500|$|Howard was {{selected}} by the Denver Broncos in the fifth round of the 1998 NFL Draft, {{but he had a}} difficult pre-season with the Broncos in 1998, fumbling five times in two games. [...] The Broncos released him from their practice squad in September 1998, and he was signed by the Jacksonville Jaguars. [...] At the time, Jacksonville Coach Tom Coughlin said: [...] "Chris Howard is a young man and he certainly still is developmental. [...] A couple weeks into our system and I think he'll be <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> be counted on. But I'm not going to say we're done with our evaluations just yet." [...] Coughlin said of Howard's fumbles with Denver: [...] "It was carelessness. [...] Basically, we'll start from scratch with him fundamentally here." [...] Howard had professional totals of 123yards rushing on 41carries and 37yards receiving on five receptions. [...] In 2000, his final year, he fumbled twice on only 21carries in the first two games. [...] These were his final two career NFL games.|$|E

After a poor season without Houtteman in 1951, Rolfe predicted, [...] "We'll be back in the first division this season because Art Houtteman is back.

Before the season started, Houtteman said, [...] "It all depends on how I get off. I'm anxious to get into the season. My arm doesn't feel any different than it did in '50. I hope I can do even better than my last year". Houtteman also took number21 on his uniform, the number he had when he first arrived with the Tigers, because he felt that it had given both him and teammate George Kell, who won a batting title with the number, good luck.|$|E

I would say it's like a pure aesthetic dance video from the very fiber of it. Everything dances onscreen. Everything has movement. Everything has a certain mechanical rhythm. He actually created a dance style for this that is mechanical. It's sort of a hyper-intense version of the robot. Even the transformations go directly in line with the movements." ...|$|E

He has a very strong arm and can throw long and he also has good accuracy on short routes. He can beat you with the bomb if his protection holds up, but he is not a good scrambler." [...] Another scout said, [...] "Tensi is just fair.
