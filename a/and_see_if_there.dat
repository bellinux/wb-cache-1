500|$|Johann Sebastian Bach {{composed}} the church cantata [...] (Behold <b>and</b> <b>see,</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> be any sorrow), , in Leipzig for the tenth Sunday after Trinity and first performed it on 1 August 1723.|$|E
500|$|The first movement, [...] "" [...] (Behold <b>and</b> <b>see,</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> be any sorrow), in two {{sections}} is a lamento of large proportions. The text of lament, {{part of the}} prescribed responsorios for Good Friday, has been set by many composers, including Tomás Luis de Victoria, Carlo Gesualdo and Handel who set it as a tenor arioso Messiah, the last movement before {{the scene of the}} death.|$|E
500|$|A {{few days}} after their dinner, Braxton telephoned Ross to confirm that she had finally signed the contract; {{this was the first}} time Ross learned that Rice had {{apparently}} promised Braxton that he would write an entirely new song for her to sing in the musical if she agreed to sign the paperwork. Panicked, Ross immediately contacted Rice, who confirmed that he had in fact agreed to write a song for Braxton, blaming himself for having consumed too much alcohol during their dinner. Rice asked Ross to allow him 24 hours to review the musical <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> was in fact a moment for which he and Menken could develop a new song, and decided to write a ballad for the second act during which Belle tells Maurice how she has changed during her stay in the Beast's castle. [...] "A Change in Me" [...] was written four years into Beauty and the Beasts run.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite!" [...] murmured Soames. Smither {{was getting}} garrulous! [...] "I {{just want to}} look round <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there's</b> {{anything}} to be done." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "There isn't {{much that}} we can take. Suppose all hands go aboard <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there's</b> {{anything}} belonging to the crew that'll pay for carrying away?" ...|$|R
500|$|Matt Bozon {{has refused}} to blame Capcom, the {{publisher}} of the game, for responsibility in the game's failure. This was despite Capcom holding it for 8 months after completion, with the game finally releasing when the Game Boy Advance was already in its first year of existence. He says he went in [...] "very naive", believing that if the game was good, it would sell anyway. Bozon believed that from a creative standpoint, he never really settled on a target audience, with the character being [...] "iconoclastic", [...] "too sexy to be a kid's brand, and too girly for a male gamer brand". Also, before the game was even released, Bozon claims that he had come to understand anyway that the game [...] "would probably not sell", as during WayForward's search for a publisher, many market analysts were skeptical at {{the idea of having a}} female lead character, and Bozon ultimately acknowledged that they probably [...] "genuinely knew their markets". He still didn't give up, as he felt that Shantae had to exist, [...] "even if it was just to reach out <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> was an audience reaching back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let--let us creep closer <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> are any--any bodies lying around," [...] faltered {{the young}} hunter. He was so {{agitated}} he could scarcely speak.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, all right. Don't {{stand there}} palavering all day, but {{out with you}} <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there's</b> a fish on the lines for breakfast. I'll be along in a minute." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you aye there? I daurna {{let you in}} till I'm {{sure the}} {{mistress}} is bedded. Gang round to the front, <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there's</b> ony licht burning in the high west window." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good," [...] I said. [...] "He's a {{contributor}} for sure. Tell him to wait. Ask the caretaker to lock {{him in the}} coal cellar, and kindly slip out <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there's</b> a policeman on the beat in case I need him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Go <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> {{is light}} {{yet in the}} {{quarters}} of the Master-of-the-Horse. If he is still up ask him to come and speak to me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] {{said his}} wife, [...] "it {{would be better}} to look out into the hall <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> isn't someone round that would tell them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hendrika," [...] {{said the}} lady presently, [...] "they must not eat meat just yet. Go {{look up the}} tree <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is any ripe fruit on it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There's nothin' in the house," [...] said Mrs. Lecks, [...] "which {{you need}} {{put your hand}} to; but, {{if you choose to}} go out into that garden, <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there's</b> {{anything}} can be done in it, or got out of it,--that is, if you know anything about garden work,--I'm sure we'd be very glad of any fresh vegetables we could get." ...|$|R
6000|$|Allan {{pointed to}} the mizzen shrouds of the wreck, which were still left standing. [...] "You are not well enough to rough it here till the workmen come off in the morning," [...] he said. [...] "We must find our way on shore at once, if we can. I am going up {{to get a good}} view all round, <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there's</b> a house within hail of us." ...|$|R
60|$|Now I {{will read}} that item myself, <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is any {{foundation}} {{for all this}} fuss. And if there is, the author of it shall hear from me.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Don't rub it in,' pleaded Beverley. 'It isn't fair. There's nobody so {{sensitive}} as a reformed floor-knocker. You {{will come up}} or let me come down, won't you? Whenever I have that sad, depressed feeling, I go out and kill a policeman. But you wouldn't care for that. So the only {{thing for you to}} do is to knock on the ceiling. Then I'll come charging down <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there's</b> anything I can do to help.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bartleby," [...] said I, [...] "Ginger Nut is away; just step {{round to}} the Post Office, won't you? (it {{was but a}} three minute walk,) <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is any thing for me." ...|$|E

5000|$|The primary {{customers}} on the {{new line}} are the Archers-Daniels-Midland plant in Kershaw and AmeriSteel on Riverside Road in Lancaster. Gedney envisions service to existing companies on the line that presently do not use rail."We {{are going to see}} what we can do initially with shippers that have been on the line that have stopped shipping like Thomas and Betts. They’ve got a rail siding going in there. We’re going to talk to them <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there's</b> anything we can do to help their business which would put rail cars on the line." ...|$|R
50|$|On the {{opposite}} side of the spectrum is the beautiful Ha-mi (Han Ji-hye), a meek university student looking for true love, but never seeming to find it. As is typical in this kind of film, the two meet purely by chance: Ha-mi accidentally text messages Young-bin before literally bumping into him. Ha-mi, feeling that their fortuitous meeting is a sign that they might be destined for one another, decides to pal around with Young-bin <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there's</b> any chemistry between them. Taken by Ha-mi's sincerity and her willingness to pick up the check, Young-bin jumps at the opportunity.|$|R
5000|$|The game [...] "Lemon Drops" [...] {{features}} every week, {{where each}} celebrity helper played the Phat Contoller, and Lemon would be launched above {{the studio audience}} and drop soft, fluffy lemons with a prize inside into the audience. However, in the fourth episode, Lemon played the Phat Controller with helper Peter Andre dropping the lemons over the audience. Lemon's motto for Lemon Drops is [...] "When life gives you lemons, open that lemon <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there's</b> a prize inside!". The other game in the studio will feature three contestants, usually each with a talent, who play to win a prize.|$|R
6000|$|The {{appearance}} of these relics of wild dissipation, however, had lifted Christie {{out of her}} sublime resignation. [...] "For Heaven's sake, Jessie," [...] she said, [...] "look around <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is anything more!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Confound that Beaver!" [...] muttered {{the hunter}} crossly. [...] "If {{there was a}} Deer {{anywhere}} around this pond, he probably {{is on his way}} now. I'll have a look around <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> are any signs." ...|$|E
6000|$|Look out <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is any one [...] There in the street--I cannot {{leave the}} glass, [...] For {{somebody}} might shake it, and the sand [...] If it were shaken might run {{down on the}} instant.|$|E

Let go of my arm, <b>and</b> I'll <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there's</b> {{anything}} in my cigarette-case to suit your complaint.' Spurstow hunted among his day-clothes, turned up the lamp, opened a little silver cigarette-case, and advanced on the expectant Hummil with the daintiest of fairy squirts.|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{original}} aims for Galaxy Zoo was to explore which way galaxies rotated. Cosmologist Kate Land stated: [...] "Some people have argued that galaxies are rotating all in agreement with each other, not randomly as we'd expect. We want people to classify the galaxies according to which way they're rotating and I'll {{be able to go}} <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there's</b> anything bizarre going on. <b>If</b> <b>there</b> are any patterns that we're not expecting, it could really turn up some surprises." [...] In Galaxy Zoo 1, volunteers were asked to judge from the SDSS images whether the galaxies were elliptical or spiral and, if spiral, whether they were rotating in a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction. The rotation, also called the Chirality, of galaxies has been examined in several Galaxy Zoo related papers.|$|R
