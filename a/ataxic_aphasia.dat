40|$|ObjectiveTo {{explore the}} {{effective}} methods {{for evaluating the}} consciousness and speech status of patients with special types of cerebral injuries. MethodsA total of 96 patients with injury in the language center and in coma were treated with operative and correlated conventional therapies. Then their recovery status of consciousness and speech was observed. ResultsAll the patients were recovered to consciousness. Sixty-nine patients with aphasia were cured completely, but 7 patients were complicated with incomplete <b>ataxic</b> <b>aphasia,</b> 15 with incomplete sensory aphasia, and 5 with incomplete mixed aphasia. ConclusionsFor the patients with injury in the language center, evaluation of the conscious state with GCS scoring system has certain limitations and conscious behaviours are advantageous evidences to evaluate the consciousness recovery of the patients. The patients with conscious disturbance and injury in the language center should be considered to have aphasia...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} {{to understand the nature}} and management of persons with speech-language-hearing (SLH) and related disorders in facilities of child welfare and the elderly in Nobeoka city, last year. This study we evaluated a case of 39 -vear-old female with head injured in facility of welfare elderly in Nobeoka city for SLH. The results indicated treble hearing loss, <b>ataxic</b> dysarthria, <b>aphasia</b> and memory disorder. We performed therapy for dysarthria, aphasia and memory disorder in SLH clinic of our university. For SLH who couldnâ€™t come to our university we plan a remote diagnostic system. Then it was concerned it was necessary to evaluate 3 aspects such as SLH at least and treat them. It is hoped to establish the system of the evaluation and management of SLH and related disorders in these facilities in Nobeoka city...|$|R
40|$|Research {{has shown}} that {{linguistic}} functions in the bilingual brain are subserved by similar neural circuits as in monolinguals, but with extra-activity associated with cognitive and attentional control. Although a role for the right cerebellum in multilingual language processing has recently been acknowledged, a potential role of the left cerebellum remains largely unexplored. This paper reports the clinical and fMRI findings in a strongly right-handed (late) multilingual patient who developed differential polyglot <b>aphasia,</b> <b>ataxic</b> dysarthria and a selective decrease in executive function due to an ischemic stroke in the left cerebellum. fMRI revealed that lexical-semantic retrieval in the unaffected L 1 was predominantly associated with activations in the left cortical areas (left prefrontal area and left postcentral gyrus), while naming in two affected non-native languages recruited a significantly larger bilateral functional network, including the cerebellum. It is hypothesized that the left cerebellar insult resulted in decreased right prefrontal hemisphere functioning due {{to a loss of}} cerebellar impulses through the cerebello-cerebral pathways.
