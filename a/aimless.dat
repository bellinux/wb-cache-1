5|$|The campaign's {{ultimate}} limitation was {{the poor}} formulation of military strategy. The types of targets selected from one operation {{to the next}} differed radically and no sustained pressure was put on any one type of British target. The Luftwaffes strategy became increasingly <b>aimless.</b> Disputes among the OKL staff revolved more around tactics than strategy. This method condemned the offensive over Britain to failure before it had begun.|$|E
5|$|The All Blacks' first-half {{play was}} {{generally}} considered poor—with <b>aimless</b> kicking to Welsh fullback Winfield who returned much better kicks into touch. The first ten minutes saw New Zealand's Roberts break the line twice only, {{to be caught}} by Winfield without support. Eventually Wales had a scrum-feed 25 yards out from the All Blacks' try-line. From this Wales executed a planned move—Owen got the Wales scrum-ball and dummied on his right to Bush. He then turned left and passed to Cliff Pritchard. Pritchard then passed to Gabe, who passed to Bush, who eventually passed to Morgan. Morgan then raced 25 yards down the touchline, eluding Gillett, to score for Wales. Winfield missed the resulting conversion—leaving the score at 3–0. In {{the final stages of}} the first half the All Blacks began to assert themselves and were attacking strongly when half-time was sounded. Dixon claimed half-time was called two minutes early, and Wallace that it was three minutes early.|$|E

It is {{the best of all possible}} worlds, which contains the promise of the redemption of the Unconscious from actual existence by the exercise of Reason in partnership with the Will in the consciousness of the enlightened pessimist.|$|E
25|$|Pamuk {{followed}} {{this with the}} novel Kar, published in 2002 (English translation: Snow, 2004). Set in the border city of Kars, it explores the conflict between Islamism and Westernism in modern Turkey. Snow follows Ka, an expatriate Turkish poet, as he wanders around the snowy Kars and gets {{caught up in the}} muddle of <b>aimless</b> Islamists, MPs, headscarf advocates, secularists, and a number of factions who die and kill in the name of highly contradictory ideals. The New York Times listed Snow as one of its Ten Best Books of 2004.|$|E
25|$|In {{presenting}} {{his theory}} of human behavior, Nietzsche also addressed, and attacked, concepts from philosophies popularly embraced in his days, such as Schopenhauer's notion of an <b>aimless</b> will or that of utilitarianism. Utilitarians claim that what moves people is mainly {{the desire to be}} happy, to accumulate pleasure in their lives. But such a conception of happiness Nietzsche rejected as something limited to, and characteristic of, the bourgeois lifestyle of the English society, and instead put forth the idea that happiness is not an aim per se—it is instead a consequence of a successful pursuit of one's aims, of the overcoming of hurdles to one's actions—in other words, of the fulfillment of the will.|$|E
25|$|Some {{other issues}} were raised, with Famitsu citing obscure {{tutorials}} {{as one of}} the game's weak points. Van Duine, while praising the art style, noted multiple dips in frame rate, showing that the hardware was having trouble coping with the game. Both Boone and Wallace noted a lack of hints for players, which resulted in bouts of <b>aimless</b> wandering. Wallace also critiqued archaic elements within the game, and faulted the artificial intelligence for other characters in battle. The game's graphics also came in for criticism, with Remi in particular comparing it to titles for the PlayStation 2. Multiple reviewers also noted rough patches when traversing the open world, with a few commenting that it was made harder when the teleport system was disabled at certain points in the story.|$|E
25|$|Although it had {{equipment}} {{capable of}} doing serious damage, the Luftwaffe had unclear strategy and poor intelligence. OKL had not been informed that Britain was {{to be considered a}} potential opponent until early 1938. It had no time to gather reliable intelligence on Britain's industries. Moreover, OKL could not settle on an appropriate strategy. German planners had to decide whether the Luftwaffe should deliver the weight of its attacks against a specific segment of British industry such as aircraft factories, or against a system of interrelated industries such as Britain's import and distribution network, or even in a blow aimed at breaking the morale of the British population. The Luftwaffes strategy became increasingly <b>aimless</b> over the winter of 1940–1941. Disputes among OKL staff revolved more around tactics than strategy. This method condemned the offensive over Britain to failure before it began.|$|E
25|$|Despite proclaiming his innocence, Butts {{confessed to}} having {{accompanied}} Bonin upon {{each of the}} murder forays {{in each of the}} charges listed against him, and to have actively participated in the sexual abuse of several victims. Butts was adamant he had had only a limited role in the torture of the victims, but confessed to actively participating in the torture of one victim. Butts claimed he typically drove in an <b>aimless</b> manner as Bonin abused and tortured his victims {{in the rear of the}} van, then stopped the vehicle in order to assist in restraining the victim as Bonin escalated the torture. When asked as to why some victims had been subjected to more extensive blunt force trauma than others, Butts stated that, in many instances, Bonin would escalate the level of beatings to which he subjected his victim if the youth resisted his sexual advances.|$|E
500|$|Damon Houx of Screen Crush {{called the}} two storylines [...] "two pieces of that didn't work {{all that well}} together", which all added to a [...] "dull" [...] episode. Houx complimented Koechner's performance, calling him a [...] "great improviser" [...] but wrote that the whole plot was lacking. He also {{considered}} the farm plotline to be pointless and <b>aimless,</b> especially due to it airing {{in the last few}} episodes of the series.|$|E
500|$|Although several Beatles biographers {{dismiss the}} track as <b>aimless,</b> [...] "It's All Too Much" [...] has {{received}} praise from many other commentators. Peter Doggett considers {{it to be}} [...] "one of the pinnacles of British acid-rock", while Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone rates it among [...] "the top five all-time psychedelic freakouts in rock history". Former Gong guitarist Steve Hillage adopted the song during his early years as a solo artist in the late 1970s. Journey, the House of Love, the Grateful Dead and the Church are among the other artists who have recorded or performed the track.|$|E

Boiling springs and huge deep pools of purest green and azure water, thousands of them, are plashing and heaving in these high, cool mountains as if a fierce furnace fire were burning beneath each one of them; and a hundred geysers, white torrents of boiling water and steam, like inverted waterfalls, are ever and anon rushing up out of the hot, black underworld." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1939, Salinger {{attended}} the Columbia University School of General Studies, {{where he took}} a writing class taught by Whit Burnett, longtime editor of Story magazine. According to Burnett, Salinger did not distinguish himself until {{a few weeks before}} the end of the second semester, at which point [...] "he suddenly came to life" [...] and completed three stories. Burnett told Salinger that his stories were skillful and accomplished, accepting [...] "The Young Folks", a vignette about several <b>aimless</b> youths, for publication in Story. Salinger's debut short story was published in the magazine's March–April 1940 issue. Burnett became Salinger's mentor, and they corresponded for several years.|$|E
500|$|More critically, Peter Cowie {{commented that}} the film [...] "suffers from its profusion of {{cultural}} references and asides". [...] Writing for New York Magazine, the hard-to-please critic John Simon called the film [...] "unfunny comedy, poor moviemaking, and embarrassing self-revelation," [...] and wrote that Keaton's performance was [...] "in bad taste to watch and indecency to display," [...] saying the part should have been played by Robin Mary Paris, the actress who appears briefly in the scene where Alvy Singer has written a two-character play nakedly based on himself and Annie Hall. [...] Simon's review of Annie Hall made a general assessment that didn't pan out: [...] "It is a film so shapeless, sprawling, repetitious, and <b>aimless</b> as to seem to beg for oblivion." ...|$|E

The film received average reviews, however, A.O. Scott of the New York Times, reported that the performances by both Sarsgaard and Parker [...] "provide a rough grain of authenticity, capturing the blunted affect and <b>aimless</b> neediness of people in their 20s struggling to navigate a world of material abundance and impoverished emotional possibility." [...] Scott concluded in his recap that Sarsgaard made his character [...] "seem like a genuinely nice guy, too innocent to grasp the sleaziness of his bargain with Florence." ...|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall, on {{his blog}} What's Alan Watching?, was mostly {{positive}} towards the episode, praising the crew's decision {{to focus on}} the mysteries of the week, stating that [...] "if the last couple of episodes are an indication, maybe done-in-one is in the right direction." [...] He found that he was invested in the case-of-the-week, while he felt as though the Dean O'Dell plotline was not advancing quickly enough. Keith McDuffee of AOL TV was critical of nearly all aspects of the episode, stating that he was missing the longer story arcs and that once the mystery of Dean O'Dell's murder ended, the show would be relatively <b>aimless.</b> In addition, he decried Mac, Wallace, Piz, and Parker's absences, saying, [...] "I miss the 'gang'." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B-".|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Vicksburg, Ewing's command wrecked Confederate President Jefferson Davis's Fleetwood Plantation, and Ewing turned over Davis' personal correspondence to his brother-in-law, Sherman. However, Ewing also sent copies of the letters to a few people he had known in Ohio, which, after the documents were published, permanently sullied the reputation of former President Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire. Their release coincided with that of Pierce's book, Our Old Home. As early as 1860, Pierce had written to Davis about [...] "the madness of northern abolitionism", and other letters uncovered stated that he would [...] "never justify, sustain, or in any way or to any extent uphold this cruel, heartless, <b>aimless</b> unnecessary war", and that [...] "the true purpose {{of the war was}} to wipe out the states and destroy property." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{efforts to}} prevent the Civil War ended with the firing on Fort Sumter, Northern Democrats, {{including}} Douglas, endorsed Lincoln's plan to bring the Southern states back into the fold by force. Pierce wanted to avoid war at all costs, and wrote to Van Buren, proposing an assembly of former U.S. presidents to resolve the issue, but this suggestion was not acted on. [...] "I will never justify, sustain or in any way or to any extent uphold this cruel, heartless, <b>aimless,</b> unnecessary war," [...] Pierce wrote to his wife. Pierce publicly opposed President Lincoln's order suspending the writ of habeas corpus, arguing that even {{in a time of}} war, the country should not abandon its protection of civil liberties. This stand won him admirers with the emerging Northern Peace Democrats, but others saw the stand as further evidence of Pierce's southern bias.|$|E
500|$|The video {{features}} Madonna at {{the empty}} suite of an abandoned hotel, a similar setting to her [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] music video. It was shot in a single frame, with the camera approaching Madonna, as she stands behind a pillar. She rotates around it and sings the song, as air blows through the room. The video ends with Madonna looking up towards the camera the last time, and then closing her eyes. It was treated with sepia color. Carol Vernallis, author of Experiencing music video: aesthetics and cultural context felt that the video was {{a good example of}} how image can direct the viewer's attention towards the shift in instrumentation and arrangement of the song. She noted the <b>aimless</b> movement of the camera towards her as [...] "bringing focus to the main subject, with the viewer's attention fully captured." ...|$|E
500|$|... 1960 was a {{critical}} year for South Korea, marking {{the end of the}} rule of Syngman Rhee through the civilian April Revolution. In 1962, another military authoritarian, General Park Chung-Hee, would ascend to power and rule South Korea for nearly two decades. The short period of relative freedom between these two administrations was known as the Second Republic. During this time, filmmakers took advantage of the relaxation of governmental control over the film industry to create several boldly experimental works. Director Yu Hyun-mok's film <b>Aimless</b> Bullet (1960) dates from this period, as does Kim Ki-young's major breakthrough, The Housemaid (also 1960). A lurid, expressionistic melodrama set in an eerie house, involving sexual obsessions, murder and rats, this is the first film in which Kim's mature style is fully evident, and is widely {{regarded as one of the}} greatest Korean films ever made.|$|E
500|$|... "Homeless" [...] {{was written}} by Swedish {{songwriter}} Jörgen Elofsson, and produced by Steve Mac. It is an R power ballad, which lasts for a duration of three minutes and 50 seconds. The song was composed on common time in the key of B minor at 68beats per minute. Instrumentation is provided by a piano and a guitar. Lewis's vocal range spans nearly two octaves from low note of A3 to the high note of B5. The song's lyrics revolve around Lewis singing about waiting for her boyfriend {{to come home to}} where she is waiting for him, but feels homeless without his presence. The opening lyrics are [...] "Wait here for you to call me/ For you to tell me that ev'rything's a big mistake." [...] Nick Levine for Digital Spy described Lewis's vocals in the lyric [...] "In this cold I'm walking <b>aimless,</b> feeling helpless" [...] as [...] "a tour de force of despair and misery".|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{contributor}} Annie Barrett {{enjoyed the}} episode, {{and said that}} Frank and Jack's [...] "Harry and the Hendersons-inspired story line" [...] was the strongest of the episode. Barrett enjoyed Patti Lupone's cameo, but said that John Lithgow's [...] "might {{have been the most}} awesome 30 Rock cameo EVER! His <b>aimless</b> wandering [...] offered a perfect way to weave the Hendersons element into Liz's baby mama struggles." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin said [...] "Goodbye, My Friend" [...] was a [...] "beautiful, elegant bit of plotting, [...] the episode's various threads came together, united by the shining example set forth by [...]" [...] Rabin gave the episode an A−.

Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad commented that Tina Fey's Liz [...] "was kinda creepy in this episode", regarding her manipulation of Becca, though, [...] "it was very funny all around and that's all that matters".|$|E
500|$|The {{stories and}} anecdotes of the Zhuangzi embody a {{unique set of}} {{principles}} and attitudes, including living one's life with natural spontaneity, uniting one's inner self with the cosmic [...] "Way" [...] (Dao), keeping oneself distant from politics and social obligations, accepting death as a natural transformation, showing appreciation and praise for things others view as useless or <b>aimless,</b> and stridently rejecting social values and conventional reasoning. [...] These principles form the core ideas of philosophical Daoism. [...] The other major philosophical schools of ancient Chinasuch as Confucianism, Legalism, and Mohismwere all concerned with concrete social, political, or ethical reforms designed to reform people and society and thereby alleviate the problems and suffering of the world. However, Zhuangzi believed that the key to true happiness was to free oneself from the world and its standards through the Daoist principle of [...] "inaction" [...] (wúwéi 無為)action that is not based on any purposeful striving or motives for gainand was fundamentally opposed to systems that impose order on individuals.|$|E
500|$|Tauranac left Brabham {{early in}} the 1972 season after Ecclestone changed the way the company was {{organised}} without consulting him. Ecclestone has since said [...] "In retrospect, the relationship {{was never going to}} work", noting that [...] " [...] both take the view: 'Please be reasonable, do it my way'". The highlights of an <b>aimless</b> year, during which the team ran three different models, were pole position for Argentinian driver Carlos Reutemann at his home race at Buenos Aires and a victory in the non-championship Interlagos Grand Prix. For the 1973 season, Ecclestone promoted the young South African engineer Gordon Murray to chief designer and moved Herbie Blash from the Formula Two programme to become the Formula One team manager. Both would remain with the team for the next 15 years. For 1973, Murray produced the triangular cross-section BT42, with which Reutemann scored two podium finishes and finished seventh in the Drivers' Championship.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Shaunna Murphy was {{a little}} more {{critical}} of the episode, though she did call it [...] "game-changing." [...] Noting that it [...] "felt rushed," [...] she [...] "would have preferred a slow-burning mystery spread out over several episodes over this dramatic, Nikki and Paulo-style stand-alone sendoff." [...] Murphy however concluded that Graham's death was [...] "one of the coolest sequences we've seen so far on this show." [...] The A.V. Club columnist Oliver Sava graded [...] "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter" [...] with a C. He also noted negative similarities to the television series Lost, explaining, [...] "Remember when Jack, Sawyer, and Kate were stuck in the polar-bear cages, and the plot just wandered in an <b>aimless</b> haze? The time when a bunch of viewers started jumping off because the writers kept adding questions without ever giving answers? What took Lost 44 episodes, OUAT has done in seven." [...] Unlike other reviewers, Sava called the ending a [...] "frustrating conclusion," [...] and believed that [...] "Horowitz and Kitsis [...] one step forward and two steps back with this development." ...|$|E
500|$|Pastors {{established}} {{a record of}} public testimonies of every baptized member. Kennel's life is known by the faithful, and has an important place in the church. The pastor's break with his former religious affiliation, and his determined foundation of a new group despite many obstacles, {{are said to be}} directed by God's will; therefore, Kennel's spiritual course (which mixes [...] "extraordinary and intransigence") is presented as an example to follow. As noted by Amiotte-Suchet, all testimonies (whose purpose is to strengthen the converts' faith) generally have a common thread; the former lifestyle of the faithful is almost always presented as [...] "a story of an <b>aimless</b> wandering, covered with failures, disappointments and misfortunes" [...] until God decides to manifest himself {{in the life of the}} future member. The future convert then demands a sign of God's reality, requires a variable length of time to strength his faith and experience the Holy Spirit, then engages fully in the church. Conversion is always said to lead to a healthier lifestyle and provide an expanded network of friends.|$|E
500|$|In 1964, de Havilland {{appeared}} {{in her last}} two leading roles in feature filmsboth psychological thrillers. In Walter Grauman's Lady in a Cage, she played a wealthy poet who gets trapped in her mansion's elevator and faces the threat of three terrorizing hooligans in her own home. Critics responded negatively to the graphic violence and cruelty shown on screen. A.H. Weiler of The New York Times called it a [...] "sordid, if suspenseful, exercise in <b>aimless</b> brutality". That same year, deHavilland {{appeared in}} Robert Aldrich's Hush… Hush, Sweet Charlotte with her close friend Bette Davis. After Joan Crawford left the picture due to illness, Davis had Aldrich fly to Switzerland to persuade a reluctant deHavilland to accept the role of Miriam Deering, a cruel, conniving character hidden behind the charming façade of a polite and cultured lady. Her quiet, restrained performance provided a counterbalance to Davis. Film historian Tony Thomas described her performance as [...] "a subtle piece of acting" [...] that was [...] "a vital contribution {{to the effectiveness of}} the film". The film was well received and earned seven Academy Award nominations.|$|E
500|$|According to Ranaut, she was [...] "stubborn and rebellious" [...] {{while growing}} up: [...] "If {{my father would}} gift my brother a plastic gun and get a doll for me, I would not accept that. I {{questioned}} the discrimination." [...] She did not subscribe to the stereotypes that were expected of her and experimented with fashion from a young age, often pairing up accessories and clothes that would seem [...] "bizarre" [...] to her neighbours. Ranaut was educated at the DAV School in Chandigarh, where she pursued science as her core subject, remarking that she was [...] "very studious" [...] and [...] "always paranoid about [...] results". She initially intended {{to become a doctor}} on the insistence of her parents. However, a failed unit test in chemistry during her twelfth grade led Ranaut to reconsider her career prospects and despite preparing for the All India Pre Medical Test, she did not turn up for the exam. Determined to find her [...] "space and freedom", she relocated to Delhi at the age of sixteen. Her decision not to pursue medicine led to constant feuding with her parents and her father refused to sponsor a pursuit he considered to be <b>aimless.</b>|$|E
500|$|Affleck's first {{starring}} film {{role was}} as an <b>aimless</b> art {{student in the}} college drama Glory Daze (1995), with Stephen Holden of The New York Times remarking that his [...] "affably mopey performance finds just the right balance between obnoxious and sad sack". He then played a bully in filmmaker Kevin Smith's comedy Mallrats (1995), and became friends with Smith during the filming. Affleck began to worry {{that he would be}} relegated to a career of [...] "throwing people into their lockers", but Smith put him in the lead role in Smith's romantic comedy Chasing Amy (1997). The film was Affleck's breakthrough. Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised Affleck's [...] "wonderful ease" [...] playing the role, combining [...] "suave good looks with cool comic timing". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly described it as a [...] "wholesome and quick-witted" [...] performance. When Affleck starred as a recently returned Korean War veteran in the coming-of-age drama Going All the Way (1997), Todd McCarthy of Variety found him [...] "excellent", while Janet Maslin of The New York Times noted that his [...] "flair for comic self-doubt made a strong impression." ...|$|E

[...] This article was copied into a chain letter and circulated among Christians as [...] "proof" [...] of their views. The following year the Canadian daily the National Post released a similar spoof article in its satirical column Post Morten, saying that [...] "Rowling—or, as she shall henceforth be referred to and credited as, Mrs. J.

500|$|The opera is scored for an {{orchestra}} without bassoons, French horns, and tuba, but augmented by saxophones, pianos, and electronic synthesizer. The percussion section incorporates numerous special effects, including a wood block, sandpaper blocks, slapsticks and sleigh bells. The work opens with {{an orchestra}}l prelude of repetitive ascending phrases, after which {{a chorus of}} the Chinese military sings solemn couplets against a subdued instrumental background. This, writes Tommasini, creates [...] "a hypnotic, quietly intense backdrop, pierced by fractured, brassy chords like some cosmic chorale", in a manner reminiscent of Philip Glass. [...] Tommasini contrasts this {{with the arrival of}} Nixon and his entourage, when the orchestra erupts with [...] "big band bursts, rockish riffs and shards of fanfares: a heavy din of momentous pomp". [...] Gramophones critic compares the sharply written exchanges between Nixon, Mao and Chou En-lai with the seemingly <b>aimless</b> wandering of the melodic lines in the more reflective sections of the work, concluding that the music best serves the libretto in passages of rapid dialogue. Tommasini observes that Nixon's own vocal lines reflect the real-life president's personal awkwardness and social unease.|$|E
500|$|Akhtar's {{next project}} was Lakshya (2004), {{a film about}} an <b>aimless</b> youngster finally setting a goal for himself, {{starring}} Hrithik Roshan and Preity Zinta. It was shot in Ladakh, Dehra Dun and Mumbai, and {{marked the beginning of}} the collaborations between Akhtar and Hrithik. He had to research the army before writing the script and directing the venture. The theme of the film, as stated by Akhtar, was about [...] "finding oneself". He also believed that if the same characters and situation were set elsewhere, the main core of the story would remain the same as the film was not about war, as it had been reported. Post-release, the film failed to make a mark at the box office and became a commercial failure. Parul Gupta of The Times of India gave it a negative review and explained that [...] "It's hard to reconcile to such triviality when it comes from Farhan Akhtar, considered the ultimate symbol of cool in Hindi filmdom." [...] On the contrary, Manish Gajjar from BBC wrote, in his positive review: [...] "Young Farhan Akhtar, proves yet again that he is one of the finest directors Bollywood has to date.
