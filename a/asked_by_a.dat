5|$|Against this background, in 1768 a {{committee}} of men commissioned James Brindley to survey a route, {{in the form of}} a canal, between Taunton and Exeter; and the survey was duly carried out by Robert Whitworth in 1769. This was to have been called the Exeter to Uphill Canal; as it involved a route from Topsham or Exeter to Taunton, then the use of the River Tone and a second canal from Burrow Bridge, via Bridgwater, Glastonbury, Wells and Axbridge, to Uphill, near Weston-super-Mare. Nothing further came of the plan until the 1790s, when various canal engineers were consulted, and in 1794 John Rennie was <b>asked</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> different committee, the Grand Western Canal Committee, to make another survey, which was adopted, and formed the basis for a planned Act of Parliament. Opposition from the City of Exeter, who feared it would compete with the Exeter Canal for transportation of coal, was eventually softened; and the Act was passed on 24 March 1796.|$|E
5|$|By the June deadline, Laing {{had made}} a payment of $200,000. GEDCA {{requested}} the outstanding $50,000 along with the $100,000 remaining balance to be paid by Laing by the September deadline. When <b>asked</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> local talk radio station if the Max Havoc: Curse of the Dragon settlement money would be a windfall for GEDCA and {{could be used for}} future economic development projects on Guam, GEDCA administrator Karl Pangelinan stated that the money would barely pay for the legal fees incurred during the years of legal fighting with Laing.

A new deadline was set for January 31, 2013. Laing missed the January deadline, but in late February, GEDCA reported receiving the money, thus bringing the lawsuit to a close.|$|E

5|$|Used as a {{food source}} since prehistoric times, the red-throated loon is still hunted by {{indigenous}} peoples {{in some parts of}} the world today. Eggs as well as birds are taken, sometimes in significant numbers; during one study on northern Canada's Igloolik Island, 73% of all red-throated loon eggs laid within the 10km2 (3.9mi2) study site over two breeding seasons were collected by indigenous inhabitants of the island. In some parts of Russia, red-throated loon skins were traditionally used to make caps and various clothing decorations, including collars. The species was also central to the creation mythologies of indigenous groups throughout the Holarctic. According to the myth—which varies only slightly between versions, despite the sometimes-vast distances that separated the groups who believed it—the loon was <b>asked</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> great shaman to bring up earth from the bottom of the sea. That earth was then used to build the world's dry land.|$|E
