5000|$|... #Caption: The Owl Hole and <b>alighting</b> <b>platform</b> at {{the back}} of the main mill building.|$|E
5000|$|The {{train station}} at Barcelona airport has been updated from 2 tracks, {{each with a}} single platform; to a single track with a {{boarding}} platform one side and <b>alighting</b> <b>platform</b> on the other.|$|E
50|$|In Hong Kong, {{the former}} KCRC (now part of MTR Corporation) reconstructed the {{platforms}} at the checkpoint terminus, Lo Wu Station, {{to a similar}} layout. When the train stops, the doors on the island (<b>alighting)</b> <b>platform</b> open and all passengers get off. Then the doors close and the doors on the side (boarding) platform open.|$|E
50|$|The upper terminus, The Peak {{is located}} below the Peak Tower {{shopping}} and leisure complex at Victoria Gap, some 150 metres below {{the summit of}} Victoria Peak. The station has the same arrangement of boarding and <b>alighting</b> <b>platforms</b> as the lower terminus. The haulage and control equipment for the funicular {{is located in a}} basement below the station.|$|R
5000|$|Gatwick Airport shuttle train between North and South terminals. Passengers wait on {{a central}} island <b>platform</b> & <b>alight</b> on side <b>platforms</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Mindaribba {{consists}} of a single wooden platform about three metres long. It is served by NSW TrainLink Hunter line services travelling between Hamilton (Newcastle) and Dungog. There are five services in each direction on weekdays, with three on Saturdays and two on Sundays. It is a request stop with passengers required to notify the guard {{if they wish to}} <b>alight.</b> The <b>platform</b> is so small that it has attracted some media attention ...|$|R
50|$|The renovated mansion has 125 rooms, 300 windows, 287 exquisitely carved {{doors and}} it was spread across 6 acre. There are entrances on each side, {{different}} from each other. The entrance on the northern side has an extrusion on the stairs presumably {{to be used as}} <b>alighting</b> <b>platform</b> from cars and chariots. The mansion is chiefly built of brick and mortar, timber and iron. Stone was dispensed with considering the amount of delay it would have on construction if it were used. There are separated drainages for rain water and used water.|$|E
50|$|As {{originally}} built, {{the station}} featured six island platforms with one <b>alighting</b> <b>platform</b> directly accessible {{from the station}} building, serving 12 tracks for New York Central Railroad trains; these were numbered 5 through 16 from south to north. (Tracks 1 and 2 were, respectively, the eastbound and westbound mainline for non-stop trains between Tracks 10 and 11, while Tracks 3 and 4 ran through the yards north of the station proper.) One additional dead-end island platform {{on the west side}} of the station building served the New York, Ontario and Western Railway (southern track) and Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (northern track), for a grand total of eight platforms serving 14 tracks. All platforms were linked by an underground passageway.|$|E
60|$|Mike was {{surprised}} to find, on <b>alighting,</b> that the <b>platform</b> was entirely free from Wrykynians. In all the stories he had read the whole school came back by the same train, and, having smashed in one another's hats and chaffed the porters, {{made their way to}} the school buildings in a solid column. But here they were alone.|$|R
60|$|Twelve {{minutes after}} its {{departure}} the train reached Willesden Junction, where it {{stopped for a}} very short interval. An examination of the tickets has made it certain that no one either joined or left it at this time, and no passenger was seen to <b>alight</b> upon the <b>platform.</b> At 5:14 the journey to Manchester was resumed, and Rugby was reached at 6:50, the express being five minutes late.|$|R
50|$|There are no lifts. Platform 2 (going towards central London) is {{at ground}} level. Platform 1 (going towards Richmond) is reached {{by a short}} set of 10 steps; {{there is also a}} wheelchair-accessible ramp. The National Archives is on the Platform 1 side of the station. The village proper, Sandycombe Road, and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew are on the Platform 2 side, and {{visitors}} to those locations who <b>alight</b> at <b>Platform</b> 1 must cross the tracks via either the tunnel underneath (left of the main exit, 15 steps down, then 22 steps up) or the footbridge (right of the main exit, 30 steps up, then 30 steps down). The simplest alternative for those wishing to avoid the steps is to remain on the train while it travels one stop to Richmond and returns.|$|R
50|$|The {{establishment}} achieved particular success {{through its}} {{link with the}} Transandine Railway, which opened in 1910. The line ran straight past the hotel, and a special railway station was erected there, about 1 km east of the station in Cacheuta village. Passengers <b>alighting</b> on the <b>platform</b> at the spa station would descend a staircase directly into the spa hotel, while their luggage would be brought down in a lift constructed within a tower modelled on an Italian campanile. Special packages and excursions were offered, and {{a wide range of}} glittering special events were celebrated in the local press.|$|R
50|$|Commencing {{operations}} on 23 February 1982, the line had initially only five stations. In 1987, the Ferry Terminal Monorail Station began operations when the Sentosa Ferry Terminal opened that year. In 1991, the Underwater World Monorail Station commenced operations when Underwater World opened that year. It operated several 16-car, non-air conditioned trains in a unidirectional counter-clockwise single loop through seven stations located around the western {{half of the}} island. The monorail rides were initially charged at S$3 for adults and S$1.50 for children. The trip was later made free for passengers, who could ride the system {{as often as they}} wished throughout their stay on the island. Four of the stations have two platforms; for such stations, the Spanish solution was employed, where passengers <b>alight</b> at one <b>platform</b> and board at the opposite platform.|$|R
50|$|Situated {{within the}} Prater {{amusement}} park, this station (English: Prater Central Station) is {{the headquarters of}} the railway. Facilities include a large staff room, a ticket office, facilities for coaling and watering steam locomotives, and (nearby) the main railway depot comprising a three-road steam shed, and a large carriage shed which doubles as a home for the diesel locomotives. There are two platforms, both on the 'outside' of the balloon loop, and effectively forming two stations (sometimes referred to as Prater Arrival and Prater Departure). For most of its history the railway has required passengers to <b>alight</b> at one <b>platform,</b> and board at the other, as a means of passenger control. However, this practice has been gradually phased out {{in the early years of}} the twenty-first century, and had ended by 2011. The former 'arrival' platform is now disused, but still in place.|$|R
2500|$|On 12 January 1921, Elwes {{was killed}} in a horrific {{accident}} at Back Bay railway station in Boston, Massachusetts, {{in the midst of a}} high-profile recital tour of the United States at the height of his powers. Elwes and his wife had <b>alighted</b> on the <b>platform</b> when the singer attempted to return to the conductor an overcoat that had fallen off the train. He leaned over too far and was hit by the train, falling between the moving carriages and the platform. He died of his injuries a few hours later. He was 54 years old. A week after the event, Edward Elgar wrote to Percy Hull, 'my personal loss is greater than I can bear to think upon, but this is nothing – or I must call it so – compared to the general artistic loss – a gap impossible to fill – in the musical world.' ...|$|R
6000|$|It was the {{advantage}} of his having let his fancy lose itself for {{a little in the}} gloom that, as by reaction, the prospect began really to brighten from the moment the deputation from Woollett <b>alighted</b> on the <b>platform</b> of the station. They had come straight from Havre, having sailed from New York to that port, and having also, thanks to a happy voyage, made land with a promptitude that left Chad Newsome, who had meant to meet them at the dock, belated. He had received their telegram, with the announcement of their immediate further advance, just as he was taking the train for Havre, so that nothing had remained for him but to await them in Paris. He hastily picked up Strether, at the hotel, for this purpose, and he even, with easy pleasantry, suggested the attendance of Waymarsh as well--Waymarsh, at the moment his cab rattled up, being engaged, under Strether's contemplative range, in a grave perambulation of the familiar court. Waymarsh had learned from his companion, who had already had a note, delivered by hand, from Chad, that the Pococks were due, and had ambiguously, though, as always, impressively, glowered at him over the circumstance; carrying himself in a manner in which Strether was now expert enough to recognise his uncertainty, in the premises, as to the best tone. The only tone he aimed at with confidence was a full tone--which was necessarily difficult {{in the absence of a}} full knowledge. The Pococks were a quantity as yet unmeasured, and, as he had practically brought them over, so this witness had to that extent exposed himself. He wanted to feel right about it, but could only, at the best, for the time, feel vague. [...] "I shall look to you, you know, immensely," [...] our friend had said, [...] "to help me with them," [...] and he had been quite conscious of the effect of the remark, and of others of the same sort, on his comrade's sombre sensibility. He had insisted on the fact that Waymarsh would quite like Mrs. Pocock--one could be certain he would: he would be with her about everything, and she would also be with HIM, and Miss Barrace's nose, in short, would find itself out of joint.|$|R
