40|$|Calcium looping {{cycle is}} {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most promising post combustion CO capture technologies that can curb CO emissions from power plants fired with fossil fuel. However the presence of SO and steam in the flue gas leads to the sulfation of CaO-based sorbents, and thus reduces the sorbents 2 ̆ 7 capacity for CO capture. In this study, the effect of sorbent sulfation during both carbonation and calcination stage on the cyclic CO capture performance was investigated. The results showed that the reaction time, SO concentrations and steam greatly influenced the capacity of CaO-based sorbent. The sulfation degree of the sorbent decreased with the reduction of carbonation and calcination time per cycle. High SO concentration present with steam led to a rapid loss in capacity of the sorbent within a few cycles. Furthermore, the synthetic sorbent derived from a sol-gel process had much higher cyclic CO capture capacities than natural limestone sorbent whether in conditions without SO or with SO and steam.

30|$|In summary, we have {{successfully}} {{demonstrated that the}} one-step selenization process using selenium vapor instead of H 2 Se can meet the demand of high efficiency and environmental friendly method for preparing high-quality CIGS thin films. The photoluminescence intensity mapping image obtained from the one-step selenized CIGS thin film suggested that there exists an optimal location (P 10) for obtaining CIGS film with superior crystalline quality. The blue-shifted photoluminescence spectra obtained from the regions at P 5 and P 10 {{are consistent with the}} lateral distribution of Ga element as revealed by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). According to the surface morphologies examined by scanning electron microscope, it is evident that the binary phase and voids of one-step selenized CIGS film can be eliminated at the P 10, with <b>agglomeration</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> and the formation of a MoSe 2 layer. Consequently, the current-voltage characteristics and external quantum efficiency of the devices made of film regions near P 10 exhibited characteristics of highly efficient carrier transportation and remarkable photon utilization, which are intimately related to the improvements <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> structures and stoichiometric composition. Finally, the femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy studies unambiguously revealed the close correlations between the defect-related carrier lifetime, density of defect states, and the conversion efficiency of the devices. The present results indicate that the one-step selenization process might serve as a viable avenue for developing the high-efficiency CIGS solar cells.|$|R

The structural analyses of the films indicate that all the films have hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnO with preferential orientation along (002) plane irrespective of the solvent volume and annealing treatment whereas, the overall crystalline quality of the films {{is found to be}} enhanced with the increase in solvent volume as well as with annealing. This observed enhancement is strongly supported by the optical and surface morphological results. From the measurements of electrical parameters, it is seen that, the annealed films exhibit better electrical properties compared to the as-deposited ones. Annealing has caused <b>agglomeration</b> <b>of</b> <b>grains</b> as confirmed by the surface morphological studies. Also, the annealing process has led to an improvement in the optical transparency as well as band gap.

50|$|The first {{encounter}} {{in which a}} particle deposits in the distal airways occurs with the broncho-alveolar lining fluid (BALF). The thickness of this fluid in the lung varies as the alveolar sacs expand and contract, but lies {{in the range of}} 0.1 to 0.9 μm. In the case of biological particles such as bacteria, this fluid opsonizes the particles to facilitate ingestion by macrophages. A similar process has been demonstrated for nonbiological carbonaceous particles. This process removes some components of the BALF that participate in opsonization, and it is postulated that this might enhance the toxicity of particles with a surface chemistry that is capable of selectively removing opsonizing components. The <b>agglomeration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grains</b> is also affected by the interactions between the BALF and the grains.

30|$|The strong {{discrepancy}} between room-temperature pellet spectra and spectra simulated from their reflectivity data {{had also been}} noted by Fabian et al. (2001). In their data which extended to 100 μ m in wavelength, they did not see a steep decrease in absorption beyond 70 μ m as did Imai et al. (2009). At 100 μ m, they obtained a factor of 20 enhancement (after correction for the PE’s influence) with the pellets. They assigned this difference tentatively to scattering losses caused by <b>agglomeration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grains</b> or by boundaries in the pellet. Agglomeration effects on far-infrared spectra had been modeled by Stognienko et al. (1995). They find enhancement factors of up to 3.5 for compact silicate aggregates, which is in agreement with our room-temperature results, but not with those of Fabian et al. and not with our results at low temperatures. Scattering from the polyethylene matrix may thus be another major contribution, although warm-pressed PE pellets are rather homogeneous.

40|$|Nanocrystalline silicon is an {{attractive}} material for solar cells. It has very small grains, about 20 nm, and yet its electronic properties {{are very similar to}} those of crystalline silicon. The material exhibits smaller mobilities than crystalline Silicon, but the minority carrier lifetimes are reasonable. It is known that the properties of the material depend critically upon deposition parameters, in particular,the degree <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> boundary passivation achieved during growth and grain size. Previous work has shown that as the material grows, the grains tend to agglomerate into a cluster, and the development of this cluster leads to poorer electronic properties. The traditional method for overcoming such clustering has been to change the hydrogen to silane dilution ratio as the material grows, keeping the material near its crystalline to amorphous transition zone. However, this method is dependent upon the precise growth chemistry and is not suitable for mass production. In this project, we develop a new device design, a superlattice comprising alternating layers of amorphous and nanocrystalline silicon, which allows one to precisely control the <b>agglomeration</b> <b>of</b> <b>grains</b> without having to resort to hydrogen profiling techniques. We study structural properties such as grain size and the degree of crystallinity, and electronic properties such as carrier diffusion lengths and defect densities. We show that an appropriate design of the superlattice allows one to minimize defect densities and maximize carrier diffusion lengths. We also study how to reduce series resistance in solar cells, and show that an appropriate combination of superlattice and contacts can lead to devices with high fill factors and good solar cell efficiencies. We also report on a new discovery, namely that the optical absorption itself depends critically upon grain size. Larger grain sizes, up to 50 nm, lead to increased optical absorption, a totally unexpected and very useful discovery for devices, since higher absorption translates into larger current densities. We show that such grain sizes can be achieved using deposition at higher temperatures. We develop a new technique, post-deposition annealing, to help passivate the grain boundaries in devices prepared at higher temperatures. Without such annealing, the device properties for devices grown at higher temperatures with larger grains are very poor. We show that when the devices are grown with larger grains, and then passivated using this new annealing technique, the current and efficiencies increase by 40...|$|R

The as-cast Mg-Zn-Nd-Zr alloy was prepared in a metal mold and then extruded into bars with an extrusion ratio of 16 : 1. Partial remelting was carried out on the extruded samples at 589 ℃ (at a heating rate of 0. 5 ℃·s- 1) for different holding times ranging from 0 to 90 min. To examine the effect of heating rate, partial remelting of samples at the heating rate of 2 ℃·s- 1 was also performed. Results show that the extruded microstructure rapidly evolutes into recrystallized grains in the semi-solid state; the liquid film initially forms at grain boundaries during the partial remelting, and then gradually changes from continuous into discontinuous state with the increase of holding time; this results in the <b>agglomeration</b> <b>of</b> adjacent <b>grains</b> and the decrease in shape factor. The value of shape factor increases continuously with holding time at first and reaches the maximum 0. 62 when holding for 60 min, while decreases rapidly after a prolonged holding time.

40|$|Direct {{synthesis}} of hierarchical zeolites currently {{relies on the}} use of surfactant-based templates to produce mesoporosity by the random stacking of 2 D zeolite sheets or the <b>agglomeration</b> <b>of</b> tiny zeolite <b>grains.</b> The benefits <b>of</b> using nonsurfactant polymers as dual-function templates in the fabrication of hierarchical zeolites are demonstrated. First, the minimal intermolecular interactions of nonsurfactant polymers impose little interference on the crystallization of zeolites, favoring the formation of 3 D continuous zeolite frameworks with a long-range order. Second, the mutual interpenetration of the polymer and the zeolite networks renders disordered but highly interconnected mesopores in zeolite crystals. These two factors allow for the {{synthesis of}} single-crystalline, mesoporous zeolites of varied compositions and framework types. A representative example, hierarchial aluminosilicate (meso-ZSM- 5), has been carefully characterized. It has a unique branched fibrous structure, and far outperforms bulk aluminosilicate (ZSM- 5) as a catalyst in two model reactions: conversion of methanol to aromatics and catalytic cracking of canola oil. Third, extra functional groups in the polymer template can be utilized to incorporate desired functionalities into hierarchical zeolites. Last and most importantly, polymer-based templates permit heterogeneous nucleation and growth of mesoporous zeolites on existing surfaces, forming a continuous zeolitic layer.

40|$|Deuterium-doped indium {{tin oxide}} films, {{fabricated}} by dc plasma deposition in sputter gas consisting of deuterium and argon, were annealed at 300 [*]°C for 40 [*]min in flowing oxygen gas by using tubular gold image furnace. On oxygen annealing, the optical transparency of the film deposited at the gas pressure ratio of deuterium to argon of 3. 6 % increased from ≈ 30 to 60 % at the wavelength of 600 [*]nm, although that of the films deposited at the ratios of 1 and 1. 5 % slightly decreased from 88 to 80 % and from 85 to 77 %, respectively. The resistivity of the films at room temperature, ranged from 2 [*]×[*] 10 − 4 to 1. 4 [*]×[*] 10 − 3 [*]Ω[*]cm corresponding to the gas pressure ratio from 1 to 3. 6 %, was almost the same {{before and after the}} annealing for each film. A change in morphology toward a smoother surface by the oxygen annealing was apparent especially for the film with the gas pressure ratio of 3. 6 %. <b>Agglomeration</b> <b>of</b> randomly oriented <b>grains</b> with diameters <b>of</b> < 100 – 200 [*]nm observed before the annealing disappeared on annealing. A smoother surface is responsible for higher transparency of the annealed films that contained densely populated hydroxyl bond before the annealing. Oxygen annealing at 300 [*]°C enlarged the optical transmittance (left panel) but decreased the population of hydrogen-bonded oxygen (right panel) of the {{indium tin oxide}} thin film fabricated by dc plasma deposition in sputter gas containing deuterium of 3. 6 %...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{processes}} in the solar nebula transforms infallen interstellar grains into planets. Somewhat surprisingly, samples of planetary material {{from the very first}} stages of this processing and aggregration were preserved, and are accessible for study in the terrestrial laboratory. These are the chondritic meteoroids, which passed the last 4. 5 Gyr safely stored in asteroids. Thermal processing <b>of</b> interstellar <b>grains,</b> sticky <b>agglomeration</b> <b>of</b> chondrules, Goldreich-Ward instability, and gravitational accretion of planetesimals into planets are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Annealing of {{nanoscale}} Ni/C multilayers and C/Ni/C trilayers {{at temperatures}} above about 670 K {{leads to the}} formation of separated Ni particles embedded in carbon. The <b>agglomeration</b> <b>of</b> the Ni layers starts by the formation of holes in the Ni layer and proceeds by hole growth and hole coalescence. Different thermodynamic driving forces and kinetic processes which can affect the observed agglomeration are discussed. The formation of holes by thermal grooving <b>of</b> Ni <b>grain</b> boundaries is analyzed quantitatively...|$|R

In this paper, the spatial <b>agglomeration</b> degree <b>of</b> eleven cultural industries of 31 provinces in China is estimated and analyzed from the region and industry by the index of E-G and CR. Using the grey correlation method, the hypothesis that spatial <b>agglomeration</b> <b>of</b> cultural industries may promote the economic growth is tested.
