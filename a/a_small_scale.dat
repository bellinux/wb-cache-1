5|$|Bromine pentafluoride (BrF5) {{was first}} {{synthesised}} in 1930. It is produced {{on a large}} scale by direct reaction of bromine with excess fluorine at temperatures higher than 150°C, and on <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> by the fluorination of potassium bromide at 25°C. It is a very vigorous fluorinating agent, although chlorine trifluoride is still more violent. Bromine pentafluoride explodes on reaction with water and fluorinates silicates at 450°C.|$|E
5|$|C.maenas is fished on <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> in the {{north-east}} Atlantic Ocean, {{with approximately}} 1200tonnes being caught annually, mostly in France and the United Kingdom.

5|$|The film's idea {{resulted}} from <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> exercise between Nemescu and Liviu Marghidan {{when they were}} in university in 2003.

5|$|As {{well as the}} {{television}} show, Live and Kicking launched a music CD, composed of the best music that artists had sung live on the programme. A video game called Live and Kicking: Showmaker was also created, where the user could combine elements of the show {{to create their own}} television production on <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>scale.</b> A monthly magazine was also produced, though towards the end of Live & Kickings production, the sales of the magazine dropped significantly, reflecting its loss of viewers.|$|E
5|$|Bad weather {{resulted}} in a decline of anti-shipping operations, and before long the Ju 87 groups began re-deploying to Poland, {{as part of the}} concealed build-up for Operation Barbarossa. By spring 1941, only St.G 1 with 30 Ju 87s remained facing the United Kingdom. Operations on <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> continued throughout the winter months into March. Targets included ships at sea, the Thames Estuary, the Chatham naval dockyard and Dover and night-bomber sorties made over the Channel. These attacks were resumed the following winter.|$|E

5|$|Boycott's {{regiment}} {{transferred to}} Belfast {{shortly after his}} arrival. Six months later, it was sent to Newry before marching to Dublin, where it remained for a year. In 1852, Boycott married Anne Dunne in StPaul's Church, Arran Quay, Dublin. He was ill between August 1851 and February 1852 and sold his commission the following year, but decided to remain in Ireland. He leased a farm in County Tipperary, where he acted as a landlord on <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>scale.</b>|$|E
5|$|Disney {{initially}} envisioned Toy Story 2 as a direct-to-video sequel. The film began {{production in}} a building separated from Pixar, on <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>scale,</b> {{as most of the}} main Pixar staff were busy working on A Bug's Life (1998). When story reels proved promising, Disney upgraded the film to theatrical release, but Pixar was unhappy with the film's quality. Lasseter and the story team redeveloped the entire plot in one weekend. Although most Pixar features take years to develop, the established release date could not be moved and the production schedule for Toy Story 2 was compressed into nine months.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the delay}} in ratifying the Lisbon Treaty, the seventh {{parliament}} was elected under the lower Nice Treaty cap. <b>A</b> <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> treaty amendment was ratified on 29 November 2011. This amendment brought in transitional provisions to allow the 18 additional MEPs created under the Lisbon Treaty to be elected or appointed before the 2014 election. Under the Lisbon Treaty reforms, Germany was the only state to lose members from 99 to 96. However, these seats were not removed until the 2014 election.|$|E

5|$|Famine {{is shaped}} by {{generally}} two theories. The first is FAD, Food Availability Decline. This {{is the result of}} a drought, a war, or some other drastic change to the agricultural system. This is the natural cause for famine. The other theory deals primarily with the population’s ability to access or become entitled to food. In this case, food power makes itself known on <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>scale,</b> as opposing political forces in Sudan compete for the votes of the people by instigating or encouraging the famine.|$|E
5|$|Grill {{established}} <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> {{trade monopoly}} at Godegård in 1775. Before he became {{owner of the}} ironworks, the farmers around Godegård had refined the wrought iron from the factory into large quantities of nails using small trip hammers. The nails were sold in Askersund. As a trader Grill would not abide this. First he decreed that the farmers had to buy all their goods at the ironworks' general store. Second, he forbade the farmers and tenant farmers to sell nails to the merchants at Askersund, at that time a center for nail trade. In this way Grill assumed control over all nail trade himself.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 57% of the Island's {{area was}} {{agricultural}} land (an increase on 2008). Major agricultural products are potatoes and dairy produce; agriculture's share of GVA increased 5% in 2009, a fifth successive year of growth. Jersey cattle {{are a small}} breed of cow widely known for its rich milk and cream; {{the quality of its}} meat is also appreciated on <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>scale.</b> The herd total in 2009 was 5,090 animals. Fisheries and aquaculture make use of Jersey's marine resources to a total value of over £6 million in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Lobster {{fishing was}} done on <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> {{especially}} in Cardigan Bay, but was reserved almost exclusively for export. Welsh fisherman {{would be more likely}} to eat the less profitable crabs. Cockles have been harvested since Roman times and are still harvested in a traditional manner with a hand rake and scraper. Cockle picking still happens in the Gower peninsula, but due to the difficulty in getting licences and reduced yield, villages near the Carmarthen Bay no longer gather them.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the past}} century, batik making in Sri Lanka has become firmly established. The Sri Lankan batik {{industry}} is <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> industry which can employ individual design talent and mainly deals with foreign customers for profit. It {{is now the}} most visible of the island's crafts with galleries and factories, large and small, having sprung up in many tourist areas. Rows of small stalls selling batiks can be found all along Hikkaduwa's Galle Road strip. Mahawewa, on the other hand, {{is famous for its}} batik factories.|$|E
5|$|Some of this retreat has {{resulted}} in efforts {{to slow down the}} loss of glaciers in the Alps. To retard melting of the glaciers used by certain Austrian ski resorts, portions of the Stubai and Pitztal Glaciers were partially covered with plastic. In Switzerland plastic sheeting is also used to reduce the melt of glacial ice used as ski slopes. While covering glaciers with plastic sheeting may prove advantageous to ski resorts on <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>scale,</b> this practice is not expected to be economically practical on a much larger scale.|$|E
