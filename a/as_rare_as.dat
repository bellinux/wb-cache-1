5|$|In {{contrast}} to Matheson's {{opinion about the}} name Ljótr, the 20th-century historian A. Morrison was {{of the opinion that}} the name may not be <b>as</b> <b>rare</b> <b>as</b> some people have thought. Morrison noted that the 19th century antiquary F.W.L. Thomas considered another saga character to be an eponymous ancestor of the MacLeods—this character was Ljótólfr, who would have lived on Lewis about a century before Leod's time. Morrison considered it possible that Leod's name could have ultimately originated from that of Ljótólfr's; however, while he considered it possible that Ljótólfr could have been an ancestor of Leod, he did not think it could have been in the male-line.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh Springer Spaniel is a {{breed of}} dog {{and a member}} of the spaniel family. Thought to be {{comparable}} to the old Land Spaniel, they are similar to the English Springer Spaniel and historically have been referred to as both the Welsh Spaniel and the Welsh Cocker Spaniel. They were relatively unknown until a succession of victories in dog trials by the breed increased its popularity. Following recognition by The Kennel Club in 1902, the breed gained the modern name of Welsh Springer Spaniel. The breed's coat only comes in a single colour combination of white with red markings, usually in a piebald pattern. Loyal and affectionate, they can become very attached to family members and are wary of strangers. Health conditions are limited to those common among many breeds of dog, although they are affected more than average by hip dysplasia and some eye conditions. They are a working dog, bred for hunting, and while not <b>as</b> <b>rare</b> <b>as</b> some varieties of spaniel, they are rarer than the more widely known English Springer Spaniel with which they are sometimes confused.|$|E

This has led newspapers to bring up issues like intersexuality in athletes due to sports being gendered, leaving the big question to everyone on what exactly is intersexuality. This was brought to worldwide attention with the case of Caster Semenya, where news spread on sporting officials having to determine whether she was to be considered female or male.|$|E

500|$|Tatuidris is rare but broadly distributed. The ants {{inhabit the}} leaf litter of Neotropical forests in Central and South America, from Mexico to French Guiana, [...] central Brazil, and Amazonian Peru. No {{collections}} are {{known from the}} Caribbean, Galápagos, or other islands. Most specimens and collections are currently known to occur in localities west of the Andes, with more collections tending to occur towards Central America and Mexico. Most collections come from mountainside (pre-montane) areas at mid elevations (usually 800–1200 meters of altitude). Collections from the lowland Amazon rainforest are few. Published records are few, but {{with the advent of}} litter sifting and Winkler extraction as a popular method of ant collecting, Tatuidris are not <b>as</b> <b>rare</b> <b>as</b> they used to seem.

500|$|Early medieval {{treasure}} bindings with {{a structure}} in precious metal, and often containing gems, carved ivory panels or metal reliefs, are perhaps better known today than leather bindings, {{but these were}} for books used in church services or as [...] "book-icons" [...] rather than for use in libraries. [...] Of treasure bindings from this period, only the lower cover of the Lindau Gospels (750–800, Morgan Library) now survives complete, though there are several references to them, most famously {{to that of the}} Book of Kells, which was lost after a theft in 1007. [...] Various metal fragments of what were probably book-mounts have survived, usually adapted as jewellery by Vikings. [...] In the context of the cult of Cuthbert, the lavishly illuminated Lindisfarne Gospels were made at Lindisfarne, probably shortly after the St Cuthbert Gospel, with covers involving metalwork, perhaps entirely made in it, which are also now lost. [...] Plainer, very early bindings in leather are almost <b>as</b> <b>rare</b> <b>as</b> treasure bindings, as the bindings of books in libraries usually wore out and needed to be renewed, and earlier collectors did not consider most historical bindings worth retaining.|$|E
500|$|Rick Kogan, {{television}} critic {{with the}} Chicago Tribune, called the show [...] "wholly original" [...] and {{an example of}} how good television entertainment can be. He praised the ensemble cast and interesting characters, and said the show would be renewed [...] "if there's any justice in TV". Ray Richmond of the Los Angeles Daily News praised NBC for giving Homicide a second chance, comparing it to the days when NBC stuck with the comedy series Cheers even though it ranked last in the ratings during its first season. Richmond said of Homicide: [...] "This {{is also one of the}} final opportunities to see a television network stick with a struggling show for no better reason than it deserves to be stuck with. In the bottom line-driven 1990s, that's become <b>as</b> <b>rare</b> <b>as</b> quality itself. [...] " [...] Steven Cole Smith with the Fort Worth Star-Telegram said of the evaluation period during Homicides second season: [...] "If you don't watch it, you may lose your right to complain that there's never anything good on TV." [...] He called it [...] "a gritty, atmospheric police series" [...] and complimented it for showing not only gratuitous violence but the consequences of it.|$|E
500|$|Later, {{historian}} W.D.H. Sellar noted Matheson's proposed {{link between}} the MacLeods and Ölvir, but commented that the evidence Matheson used was entirely circumstantial. Sellar was {{of the opinion that}} Ölvir was not such a rare name as Matheson had previously thought. Sellar also noted that the genealogy and family of Ölvir, recorded in the Orkneyinga saga, has no similarity with the line recorded in the Gaelic genealogies concerning the ancestry of Leod. Matheson's association of Ölvir to the Macleods was also attacked by clan historian Alick Morrison. Morrison commented that the name Ljotr was also not <b>as</b> <b>rare</b> <b>as</b> Matheson had proposed. Morrison noted that, in the previous century, Thomas had considered another saga character to be an eponymous ancestor of the MacLeods—this character was Ljótólfr (mentioned earlier in the article), who would have lived on Lewis about a century before Leod's time. In fact, Morrison did not consider Ölvir's name—and the singled-out Gaelic names—to be anything but other forms of Óláfr. However, Óláfr and Ölvir are considered by others to be quite different names, with separate origins. Morrison, and Sellar, also noted that the bynames of Ölvir, and Leod's great-grandfather, do not appear to match up—in three of the relevant Gaelic pedigrees, the byname of Leod's great-grandfather appears as snoice, snaige, and snáithe. Thomas considered these bynames to mean [...] "hewer"; although, both Matheson and Sellar disagreed with this translation. Morrison considered these to equate to snaith, [...] "white";' however, Sellar noted that Morrison gave no further explanation for this assertion. Sellar, himself, proposed that the byname may be not be Gaelic, but Norse in origin. He suggested that it may refer to some sort of deformity to the man's nose; another suggestion forwarded to him was that it may refer to a cleft palate. Later, A.P. MacLeod noted that the Gaelic snatha—which has a secondary meaning of [...] "grief", and [...] "trouble"—may be a nominative form of the genitive snaithe, and thus may equate to Ölvir's byname.|$|E

2500|$|Not all metal {{required}} fire {{to obtain}} it or work it. Isaac Asimov speculated that gold was the [...] "first metal". His reasoning {{is that by}} its chemistry it is found in nature as nuggets of pure gold. In other words, gold, <b>as</b> <b>rare</b> <b>as</b> it is, is sometimes found in nature as the metal that it is. [...] There are a few other metals that sometimes occur natively, {{and as a result}} of meteors. Almost all other metals are found in ores, a mineral-bearing rock, that require heat or some other process to liberate the metal. Another feature of gold is that it is workable as it is found, meaning that no technology beyond a stone hammer and anvil to work the metal is needed. [...] This is a result of gold's properties of malleability and ductility. The earliest tools were stone, bone, wood, and sinew, all of which sufficed to work gold.|$|E
2500|$|The swan goose was uplisted from Near Threatened to Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List in 1992 {{and further}} to Endangered in 2000, as its {{population}} is declining due to habitat loss and excessive hunting and (particularly on the Sanjiang Plain in China) egg collecting. But new {{research has shown}} it to be not <b>as</b> <b>rare</b> <b>as</b> it was believed, and consequently, it was downlisted to Vulnerable status again in 2008.
