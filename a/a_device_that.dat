5|$|A bus-powered hub is a {{high-power}} device providing low-power ports. It draws 1 {{unit load}} for the hub controller and 1 unit load {{for each of}} at most 4 ports. The hub may also have some non-removable functions in place of ports. A self-powered hub is <b>a</b> <b>device</b> <b>that</b> provides high-power ports. Optionally, the hub controller draw power for its operation as a low-power device, but all high-power ports draw from the hub's self-power.|$|E
5|$|Each {{level in}} the game is {{intended}} to have a unique theme, in either fiction or game mechanic. In one level, the player is confronted with two factions each with their own assassination target, and may use the level's reoccurring dust storms for cover. In another, time distortion is introduced as the player traverses an abandoned mansion in ruins. The player is given <b>a</b> <b>device</b> <b>that</b> lets them glimpse three years into the past, where the mansion is still occupied and guards roam, and can shift {{back and forth between}} the two points in time.|$|E

5|$|Pontecorvo {{created a}} neutron source using radium and beryllium, as the Via Panisperna boys had, with {{paraffin}} wax as a neutron moderator, and measured {{the absorption of}} different minerals using methods developed by Fermi and Amaldi. By June 1941, he had <b>a</b> <b>device</b> <b>that</b> could differentiate shale, limestone and sandstone, and map the transitions between them. The technique may be considered the first practical application {{of the discovery of}} slow neutrons, and would still be in use decades later for well logging. He filed four patents relating to his instrumentation.|$|E
5|$|Special unpitched stops {{also appear}} in some organs. Among {{these are the}} Zimbelstern (a wheel of {{rotating}} bells), the nightingale (a pipe submerged in a small pool of water, creating {{the sound of a}} bird warbling when wind is admitted), and the effet d'orage ("thunder effect", <b>a</b> <b>device</b> <b>that</b> sounds the lowest bass pipes simultaneously). Standard orchestral percussion instruments such as the drum, chimes, celesta, and harp have also been imitated in organ building.|$|E
5|$|The fifth book {{looks more}} to the future; for example, Monteverdi employs the concertato style with basso continuo (<b>a</b> <b>device</b> <b>that</b> {{was to become a}} typical feature in the {{emergent}} Baroque era), and includes a sinfonia (instrumental interlude) in the final piece. He presents his music through complex counterpoint and daring harmonies, although at times combining the expressive possibilities of the new music with traditional polyphony.|$|E

After Master Chief retrieves and prepares to use the Index, Cortana re-appears and warns him against the activation. She has discovered that Halo's defense system is a weapon designed to kill all sentient life in the galaxy, which will deny the host bodies the Flood requires to spread, a revelation which Guilty Spark confirms.|$|E
5|$|The series—presented {{as if it}} were a real documentary—depicts the {{everyday}} lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) programs <b>a</b> <b>device</b> <b>that</b> will fire all of the employees and effectively close down the branch if they make too many mistakes. Meanwhile, Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) attempts to court the new warehouse worker, Val.|$|E
5|$|A solar cell, or {{photovoltaic}} cell (PV), is <b>a</b> <b>device</b> <b>that</b> converts light into electric current using the photovoltaic effect. The first solar cell was constructed by Charles Fritts in the 1880s. The German industrialist Ernst Werner von Siemens {{was among those}} who recognized the importance of this discovery. In 1931, the German engineer Bruno Lange developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide, although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity. Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the silicon solar cell in 1954. These early solar cells cost 286USD/watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5–6%.|$|E
50|$|A {{hardware}} security module (HSM) is <b>a</b> physical computing <b>device</b> <b>that</b> safeguards {{and manages}} digital keys for strong authentication and provides cryptoprocessing.

5|$|Civilian {{telephones}} {{were used}} {{at the outset of}} the war, but they were found to be unreliable in the damp, muddy conditions that prevailed. Consequently, the field telephone was designed; <b>a</b> <b>device</b> <b>that</b> operated with its own switchboard. Apart from voice communication, it featured a buzzer unit with a Morse code key, so that it could be used to send and receive coded messages. This facility proved useful when, in the midst of bombardment, exploding shells drowned out voice communication. The telephones were connected by lines that sustained continual damage as a result of shell fire and the movement of troops. The lines were generally buried, with redundant lines set in place to compensate for breakages.|$|E
5|$|Following a lead, Sora, Donald, and Goofy enter a {{passageway}} through Twilight Town. There {{they encounter}} Axel, who sacrifices himself {{to create a}} passageway to the World That Never Was, the headquarters of Organization XIII, with Kingdom Hearts looming overhead as a heart-shaped moon. Sora finds Kairi and Riku, the latter of whose appearance has been changed to that of Xehanort's Heartless. King Mickey encounters DiZ, who reveals himself to be the true Ansem, Xehanort's mentor. Ansem uses <b>a</b> <b>device</b> <b>that</b> dissipates some of Kingdom Hearts' power, but a system overload causes the device to self-destruct, both engulfing Ansem and miraculously returning Riku to his original form. At {{the top of the}} Castle That Never Was, Sora and company battle Xemnas, who uses what remains of Kingdom Hearts to power his multiple forms. After Sora and Riku destroy Xemnas, the two are reunited with their friends at their home, Destiny Islands. A post-credits scene shows Sora, Kairi and Riku read a letter from Mickey, which is hidden from the player.|$|E
5|$|HDMI {{can only}} be used with older analog-only devices (using {{connections}} such as SCART, VGA, RCA, etc.) {{by means of a}} digital-to-analog converter or AV receiver, as the interface does not carry any analog signals (unlike DVI, where devices with DVI-I ports accept or provide either digital or analog signals). Cables are available that contain the necessary electronics, {{but it is important to}} distinguish these active converter cables from passive HDMI to VGA cables (which are typically cheaper as they don't include any electronics). The passive cables are only useful if you have <b>a</b> <b>device</b> <b>that</b> is generating or expecting HDMI signals on a VGA connector, or VGA signals on an HDMI connector; this is a non-standard feature, not implemented by most devices.|$|E
