5|$|Edmund McMillen from Team Meat, the {{developer}} of the indie game Super Meat Boy, created various accounts on PETA's official forums {{to try to}} get his game parodied by PETA. PETA developed Super Tofu Boy and released it in December 2010. It stars Tofu Boy, an anthropomorphic cube of tofu whose goal is to rescue Bandage Girl, the girlfriend of the original game's protagonist Meat Boy, from Meat Boy. It plays as a standard platformer and is peppered with inter-level pro-vegetarian messages <b>and</b> <b>facts</b> about meat consumption and the livestock industry.|$|E

R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings novels—in late 2002. An updated version of The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter was published in 2004 by Berkley Books, just before the film Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was released. Colbert wrote and published The Magical Worlds of Narnia in 2005, {{a guide to the}} fictional Narnia universe.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{have to make}} {{considerable}} assumptions {{trying to}} reconstruct the full family tree because of extremely scarce written sources about {{the early history of}} Lithuania. The matter is further complicated by the 16–17th century genealogies, most famously the Bychowiec Chronicle, that mixed legends <b>and</b> <b>facts</b> into one. The legends about Palemonids, a noble family from the Roman Empire who settled in Lithuania and gave rise to the Duchy, are quite popular and widespread in these genealogies. The real historical data comes from the Russian and Livonian chronicles, most important of these being the Hypatian Codex.|$|E

5|$|S {{is about}} {{voyeurism}} {{as it relates}} to underground films. Interviews with horror film directors and Carol J. Clover, a writer on the horror genre, are weaved between clips from horror films. In the beginning of the film, clips show the directors and Clover commenting on a horror film that is not shown onscreen and with the title not mentioned. The film then moves on to Petty's meetings with Eric Rost (Erik Marcisak), Bill Zebub, and Fred Vogel. He interviews these men and actress Debbie D., while clips from horror films <b>and</b> <b>facts</b> and opinions provided by Clover about the genre are interspersed.|$|E
5|$|Domain-general {{views of}} {{vocabulary}} development argue that {{children do not}} need principles or constraints in order to successfully develop word-world mappings. Instead, word learning can be accounted for through general learning mechanisms such as salience, association, and frequency. Children are thought to notice the objects, actions, or events that are most salient in context, and then to associate them with the words that are most frequently used in their presence. Additionally, research on word learning suggests that fast mapping, the rapid learning that children display after a single exposure to new information, is not specific to word learning. Children can also successfully fast map when exposed to a novel fact, remembering both words <b>and</b> <b>facts</b> after a time delay.|$|E
25|$|If {{the subject}} of a Poem is obscure, or not {{generally}} known, or not interesting, and if it abounds with allusions, <b>and</b> <b>facts</b> of this improper, and uninteresting character, the writer who chuses the subject, and introduces those improper, and unaffecting allusions, <b>and</b> <b>facts,</b> betrays a great want of poetical judgment, and taste. Mr. Gray had a vitiated fondness for such insipid fable, narrative, and references.|$|E

25|$|Instead {{of actions}} on sets, one can define actions of groups and monoids on objects of an {{arbitrary}} category: {{start with an}} object X of some category, and then define an action on X as a monoid homomorphism into the monoid of endomorphisms of X. If X has an underlying set, then all definitions <b>and</b> <b>facts</b> stated above can be carried over. For example, if we take the category of vector spaces, we obtain group representations in this fashion.|$|E
25|$|In 1907 a {{selection}} of his speeches was published under the title A Nation in Arms. Roberts provided William Le Queux with information for his novel The Invasion of 1910 and checked the proofs. In 1910 Roberts' friend Ian Hamilton, in co-operation with the Secretary of State for War, Richard Haldane, published Compulsory Service in which he attacked Roberts' advocacy of conscription. This caused much hurt to Roberts. He replied, {{with the help of}} Leo Amery and J. A. Cramb, with Fallacies <b>and</b> <b>Facts</b> (1911).|$|E
25|$|Social constructivist {{scholars}} view {{learning as}} an active process where learners should learn to discover principles, concepts <b>and</b> <b>facts</b> for themselves, hence the importance of encouraging guesswork and intuitive thinking in learners (Brown et al.1989; Ackerman 1996). In fact, for the social constructivist, reality {{is not something that}} we can discover because it does not pre-exist prior to our social invention of it. Kukla (2000) argues that reality is constructed by our own activities and that people, together as members of a society, invent the properties of the world.|$|E

25|$|Many issues {{damage the}} {{relationship}} of science {{to the media and}} the use of science and scientific arguments by politicians. As a very broad generalisation, many politicians seek certainties <b>and</b> <b>facts</b> whilst scientists typically offer probabilities and caveats. However, politicians' ability to be heard in the mass media frequently distorts the scientific understanding by the public. Examples in the United Kingdom include the controversy over the MMR inoculation, and the 1988 forced resignation of a Government Minister, Edwina Currie, for revealing the high probability that battery farmed eggs were contaminated with Salmonella.|$|E

She cited a number of cases to emphasize the importance of the state taking responsibility for this class of unfortunates. Dix's plea was to provide moral treatment for the mentally ill, which consisted of three values: modesty, chastity, and delicacy.|$|E
