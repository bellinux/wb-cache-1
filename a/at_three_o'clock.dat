5|$|Hundreds of Iowa {{children}} were left homeless by the Civil War. On November 16, 1865, the Iowa Soldiers' Orphans' Home (renamed the Annie Wittenmyer Home in 1949) was opened. The first 150 children arrived from Keokuk, Iowa. Starting in 1876, children from broken homes {{as well as}} orphans from all of Iowa's ninety-nine counties were taken in at the home. The home was a self-contained community, containing residences, a school, tailor shop, and a chapel. The home had three separate fires during its course. On November 9, 1887, <b>at</b> <b>three</b> <b>o’clock</b> in the morning, the third fire started. The building burnt to the ground. The next day’s Morning Democrat Gazette pointed out that if home was not set up with several different buildings as houses, all 350 children at the time would have been homeless, and some may have not survived the fire. After 110 years of service, the home closed in 1975. It is estimated that well over 12,000 {{children were}} helped by the Home during its operation.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{made one}} hundred oxy-hydrogen balloon bombs for the {{government}} to do a full scale experiment of producing rain. The balloons were 10, 12, and 20 feet in diameter. The purpose of the Texas experiment was to see if making artificial rain could be done by man-made weather modification. After the experiment took place it was reported that the result was a success of what was hoped for. The news press release of August 20, 1891, reported that rain was made to fall two days before <b>at</b> <b>three</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the afternoon. At the time the sky was clear and there was no prediction of rain in the area for at least a week. The claim was that the rain produced was directly or indirectly caused by the explosion of the oxygen-hydrogen balloon bombs that were exploded electrically at altitudes of 1800 to 3000 feet. That started a sequence of events that lead to a torrent. The rain storm that ensued was reported by ranchers and railroad linemen for some thousand miles across several states. After this Myers was contracted by paper companies in New York state to see about producing rain in their forests that needed it badly. He contended that the Mohawk Valley was {{a good place to start}} rain and that the rainfall then would go to the Adirondack Mountains and Catskill Mountains.|$|E

25|$|<b>At</b> <b>three</b> <b>o'clock</b> p.m. on Monday at St. George's Mortuary, Dr. Blackwell and I made a {{post mortem}} examination. Rigor mortis was still {{thoroughly}} marked. There was mud {{on the left}} side of the face and it was matted in the head. The body was fairly nourished. Over both shoulders, especially the right, and under the collarbone and in front of the chest there was a bluish discoloration, which I have watched and have seen on two occasions since.|$|E
25|$|<b>At</b> <b>three</b> <b>o'clock</b> Father William Corby, the University president, {{met with}} his wisest assistants and they {{determined}} that nothing could be done but close the college for the year. An hour after he communicated the decision to the students assembled in the church. Students {{did not want to}} leave, but Fr. Corby {{made it clear that the}} University could not provide any accommodations. Hence, the students were sent home for the semester. The loss was estimated at $200,000 and only $45,000 was recovered from the insurance. It was a terrible blow, for in three hours was wiped out the result of thirty-five years of hard, grueling sacrifice.|$|E

25|$|In 1875, he {{was named}} Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford and in 1876 assumed the new Chair of Chinese Language and Literature at Oxford, where he {{attracted}} few students to his lectures but worked hard for some 20 years in his study at 3 Keble Terrace, on his translations of the Chinese classics. According to an anonymous contemporary obituary in the Pall Mall Gazette, Legge was in his study every morning <b>at</b> <b>three</b> <b>o'clock,</b> winter and summer, having retired to bed at ten. When he {{got up in the}} morning {{the first thing he did}} was to make himself a cup of tea over a spirit-lamp. Then he worked away at his translations while all the household slept.|$|E
25|$|On April 30, 1603, a {{fire started}} {{in a little}} field house used by some Filipinos and Negroes of the native {{hospital}} in the city, <b>at</b> <b>three</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the afternoon, and passed to other houses so quickly, {{with the force of}} the rather fresh wind, that it could not be stopped. It burned houses of wood and stone, even the monastery of St. Dominic, the royal hospital for the Spaniards, and the royal warehouses, without leaving a building standing among them. Fourteen people died in the fire, Spaniards, Filipinos and Negroes, among them Licentiate Sanz, canon of the cathedral. In all 260 houses were burned, with much property that was in them. The damage was estimated at more than one million pesos.|$|E
500|$|Bede {{died on the}} Feast of the Ascension, Thursday, 26 May 735, on {{the floor}} of his cell, singing [...] "Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit" [...] and was buried at Jarrow. Cuthbert, a disciple of Bede's, wrote a letter to a Cuthwin (of whom nothing else is known), {{describing}} Bede's last days and his death. According to Cuthbert, Bede fell ill, [...] "with frequent attacks of breathlessness but almost without pain", before Easter. On the Tuesday, two days before Bede died, his breathing became worse and his feet swelled. He continued to dictate to a scribe, however, and despite spending the night awake in prayer he dictated again the following day. <b>At</b> <b>three</b> <b>o'clock,</b> according to Cuthbert, he asked for a box of his to be brought, and distributed among the priests of the monastery [...] "a few treasures" [...] of his: [...] "some pepper, and napkins, and some incense". That night he dictated a final sentence to the scribe, a boy named Wilberht, and died soon afterwards. The account of Cuthbert does not make entirely clear whether Bede died before midnight or after. However, by the reckoning of Bede's time, passage from the old day to the new occurred at sunset, not midnight, and Cuthbert is clear that he died after sunset. Thus, while his box was brought <b>at</b> <b>three</b> <b>o'clock</b> Wednesday afternoon the 25th, {{by the time of the}} final dictation it might be considered already Thursday in that ecclesiastical sense, although the 25th in the ordinary sense.|$|E

More, after the heavy rain came drizzle and a thick mist that deepened as evening approached.|$|R

He counted the minutes, as {{if such a}} course would make the time pass more rapidly, and was so {{thoroughly}} exhausted when, <b>at</b> nearly <b>three</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the afternoon, the work of picking the lock was begun, {{that he could not}} have made himself heard even had the gag been removed.|$|R
500|$|John Hurt plays Harold [...] "Ox" [...] Oxley, Mutt's {{surrogate}} {{father and}} Indiana's old friend. Frank Darabont had suggested Hurt while writing the screenplay. The character {{is inspired by}} Ben Gunn of Treasure Island. Hurt read the script before agreeing to his role, unlike other cast members who came on [...] "because Steven— you know, 'God'— was doing it. And I said, 'Well, I {{need to have a}} little bit of previous knowledge even if God is doing it.' So they sent a courier over with the script from Los Angeles, gave it to me <b>at</b> <b>three</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the afternoon in London, collected it again at eight o'clock in the evening, and he returned the next day to Los Angeles." ...|$|E
500|$|Akiva Goldsman {{decided to}} move the story from Los Angeles to New York City to take {{advantage}} of locations that would more easily show emptiness. Goldsman explained, [...] "L.A. looks empty <b>at</b> <b>three</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the afternoon, [...] New York is never empty [...] [...] [...] it was a much more interesting way of showing the windswept emptiness of the world." [...] Warner Bros. initially rejected this idea because of the logistics, but Francis Lawrence was determined to shoot on location, to give the film a natural feel that would benefit from not shooting on soundstages. Lawrence went to the city with a camcorder, and filmed areas filled with crowds. Then, a special effects test was conducted to remove all those people. The test had a powerful effect on studio executives. Michael Tadross convinced authorities to close busy areas such as the Grand Central Terminal viaduct, several blocks of Fifth Avenue, and Washington Square Park. The film was shot primarily in the anamorphic format, with flashback scenes shot in Super 35.|$|E
500|$|An [...] "Anybody But McGovern" [...] coalition, led by {{southern}} Democrats {{and organized}} labor, {{formed in the}} weeks following the final primaries. McGovern's nomination did not become assured until {{the first night of}} the 1972 Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida, where, following intricate parliamentary maneuverings led by campaign staffer Rick Stearns, a Humphrey credentials challenge regarding the California winner-take-all rules was defeated. Divisive arguments over the party platform then followed; what resulted was arguably the most liberal one of any major U.S. party. On July 12, 1972, McGovern officially won the Democratic nomination. In doing so and in taking over the party's processes and platform, McGovern produced what The New York Times termed [...] "a stunning sweep". The convention distractions led to a hurried process to pick a vice presidential running mate. Turned down by his first choice, Ted Kennedy, as well as by several others, McGovern selected – with virtually no vetting – Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton. On the final night of the convention, procedural arguments over matters such as a new party charter, and a prolonged vice presidential nomination process that descended into farce, delayed the nominee's acceptance speech. As a result, McGovern delivered his speech, [...] "Come home America!", <b>at</b> <b>three</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning, reducing his television audience from about 70million people to about 15million.|$|E
