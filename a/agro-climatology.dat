40|$|The longstanding {{conflict}} in South Sudan {{has led to}} a heavy reliance on a fragmented knowledge base. Current reconstruction and recovery activities impose the urgent need of a unified and a systematic knowledge base to identify livelihood opportunities and constraints and development priorities. The increased availability of spatially-continuous datasets provides an opportunity to create a spatial database to meet this need. A considerable effort has been dedicated on developing livelihood zones since the 1950 s but there are still gaps. In this paper we use ArcGIS to generate a dataset comprising 10 physiographic zones based on five raster datasets: <b>agro-climatology</b> (length of growing period), digital elevation model, USGS land cover, NDVI and FAO Soils of the World. These new zones attempt to bridge the knowledge gap and improve our understanding of the spatial distribution of physiographic characteristics, which are key determinants of livelihoods. In addition, it provides a primary spatial database that can readily be combined with formal surveys to refine livelihoods, conduct vulnerability analysis and identify constraints and opportunities for development programmes. The paper concludes with a discussion of how the map could be used for both contingency and development planning and priority setting...|$|E
40|$|Lack of {{awareness}} of the critical factors involved in production of plants and sometimes, the cultivation of plants in areas unsusceptible to plant, can {{increase the amount of}} chemical fertilizer consumption in order to compensate the subsequent reduction of plant yield. This would increase environmental pollution. Thus, identifying of suitable areas where could supply plants initial needs of the environment is critical. For this goal, several criteria including soil conditions, climatologically indicators, topography situation and <b>agro-climatology</b> criteria were taken into account of modeling processing. Doing so, standardization process was performed on criteria and weighting process was performed by using of analytic hierarchy process approach. Geographical information system based on multi-criteria decision analysis was employed for weighted overlapping of indicators. Initial results indicated that East-Azerbaijan Province {{in the northern part of}} Iran has high potential for cultivating of Damask Rose. Results indicate that about 34. 4 % of East Azerbaijan Province has classified to be high suitability for cultivating this plant, while about 65. 5 and 0. 1 % of this area classified to be in the moderate and low suitability category respectively. In comparison of Damask Rose production during the 2014 and resulted analytic hierarchy process map results showed that areas with high suitability are not more under cultivation of this plant. Then, the findings of this study are great of importance for the purpose of regional planning in East-Azerbaijan Province...|$|E
40|$|Southeast Asia (e. g. Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia), Japan, and North and South Korea, 17 {{countries}} in total, have {{a population of}} 846 million people, which is about 9 % of the world’s population; it is predicted to increase to 1 billion by 2050. This population expansion will coincide with a reduction in arable land due {{to an increase in}} urban and industrial development, increasing precipitation variability, and sea level rise. Additionally, these 17 countries are leading exporters of rice, sugar, shrimp, cassava, oil palm, pulses & beans, cocoa & coffee, tropical fruit, and spices. To help address the future food demand, in support of the Global Food Security-Support Analysis Data (GFSAD) project, this study mapped a wall to wall 30 -m cropland product for the nominal year 2015 at 30 -m resolution using 10 band cloud free composites derived from, Landsat- 7 & 8 data from 2013 - 2016. The study adopted random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm and generated croplands versus non-croplands knowledge using several thousand training samples derived from sub-meter to 5 -m very high spatial resolution imagery. The RF algorithm was run separately in seven distinct zones based on political divisions, <b>agro-climatology,</b> and elevation to ensure knowledge base that can distinctly separate croplands from non-croplands. All computing was performed on Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. Accuracies (overall, producer’s and user’s) accuracies of the croplands exceeded 80 % as determined by an independent accuracy assessment team. Overall croplands areas of 17 countries was 128 Mha compared with UN FAO reported cropland areas of 137 Mha...|$|E
40|$|Questions as {{to whether}} public {{investment}} in international agricultural research is a `Good Thing' or not may best be addressed using two arguments: (1) justifications based {{on whether or not}} past investments have yielded substantial benefits to societies and the resource-poor; and (2) that future investments need to be made as effectively and efficiently as possible, which means they must be targeted as closely as possible. A major component of any impact assessment framework that aspires to comprehensiveness is information on the location of different agricultural systems and pertinent characteristics of the resource-poor who operate them. Given the importance of livestock to the diets and incomes of poor farming households, and the predicted increase in demand for livestock products throughout the developing world over the next few decades, understanding how livestock fit into these systems, and how these systems may evolve in the future, is critical. This is especially true in Africa, where approximately 27 % (162 million people) of the world's poor livestock keepers live. In this paper, we further develop a global livestock production system classification put forward by Seré and Steinfeld in 1996. These livestock systems fall into four categories: landless systems, livestock only/rangeland-based systems (areas with minimal cropping), mixed rainfed systems (mostly rainfed cropping combined with livestock) and mixed irrigated systems (a significant proportion of cropping uses irrigation and is interspersed with livestock). We then describe a method for mapping the classification, based on <b>agro-climatology</b> (length of growing period), land cover, and human population density. We conclude with a discussion of how the maps could be refined, and indicate their potential use in a range of different policy and research and development applications...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} rainfall deficits and social and economic inequality within rural Ethiopian communities. The first set of analyses focuses {{on the case of}} a single rainfall deficit-affected community in rural southern Ethiopia, drawing upon data from qualitative interviews, focus groups, and a household survey. Results show that livestock inequality decreased at a greater rate during the drought-affected years than a preceding year with average rainfall. Non-livestock asset dynamics appeared largely disconnected from drought. These results are in part supported by a statistical analysis of the association between rainfall deficits and wealth inequality within rural communities across three regions of Ethiopia. This set of analyses draws upon the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Surveys and an <b>agro-climatology</b> dataset from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Results show that rainfall deficits were associated with decreased livestock inequality in the region of Tigray, but nonsignificant changes in Amhara and Oromiya. The association between drought and non-livestock assets was non-significant. The case study also considered the effect of rainfall shocks on other forms of inequality. Results suggest that the equalizing effect of drought on livestock ownership corresponded with growing inequalities in other outcomes. Households that sold livestock often did so from of a position of relative power within the community. Many of these households were able to use the proceeds of livestock sales to maintain food consumption and assist other households. Such assistance was often paid back in cash or labor, and implicitly increased the benefactor's access to the beneficiary's labor in the future. In contrast, less wealthy households often responded to drought-related food insecurity by engaging in wage labor, and borrowing food or money. The receipt of resources during periods of environmental stress often improved access to essential food, but came with expectations of repayment or obligations to provide future labor. These relationships and obligations may constitute sources of cumulative (dis) advantage over the long run. It may be productive to move away from a purely social determinants perspective on vulnerability to environmental change, and instead consider how social inequality and environmental shocks interact in a cyclical manner over time. 2019 - 08 - 1...|$|E
