5000|$|<b>Alphanumeric</b> <b>address</b> is {{at first}} {{put to the}} GSM 7 bit default alphabet, then encoded {{the same way as}} any message text in TP-UD field (that means it is 7-bit packed) and then the address is {{supplied}} with the [...] "number" [...] length and TON and NPI.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{a fictional}} <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>address</b> Design@Home is {{converted}} to the GSM 7 bit default alphabet which yields 11 bytes 44 65 73 69 67 6E 00 48 6F 6D 65 (hex), the 7-bit packing transforms it to 77 bits stored in 10 octets as C4 F2 3C 7D 76 03 90 EF 76 19; 77 bits is 20 nibbles (14 hex) which {{is the value of}} the first octet of the address. The second octet contains TON (5) and NPI (0), which yields D0 hex. The complete address in the GSM format is 14 D0 C4 F2 3C 7D 76 03 90 EF 76 19.|$|E
50|$|Telephone numbers {{should have}} NPI=1. Application servers may use <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>addresses</b> which have TON=5, NPI=0 combination.|$|R
50|$|SIP {{addresses}} {{may be used}} {{directly in}} configuration files (for instance, in Asterisk (PBX) installations) or specified through the web interface of a voice-over-IP gateway provider (usually as a call forwarding destination or an address book entry). Systems which allow speed dial from a user's address book using a vertical service code may allow a short numeric code (like *75xx) to be translated to a pre-stored <b>alphanumeric</b> SIP <b>address.</b>|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} features in an urban geographic information system is the ability to locate addresses, in any form employed by the population, in a quick and efficient way. From an organized set of georeferenced address data, local governments, infrastructure companies, and the various agents that need to work in urban spaces can reliably and precisely locate points of their interest, in fields of application as diverse as public health services, crime fighting, product distribution, postal delivery and many others. This activity is known as geocoding, which can be defined as the process of locating points {{on the surface of the}} Earth from <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>addressing</b> data associated to events. This paper shows how geocoding can be implemented over incomplete and possibly inaccurate addressing data (which is the prevailing situation in Brazilian cities) and how users can benefit from the results of such a process. A geocoding quality indicator is proposed, with the intention of providing an indication of the degree of certainty that is associated with each individual result of the geocoding process. This indicator can then be used in spatial analysis, by giving analysts the opportunity to include the uncertainty associated with the data in their work. This project is under development, and a set of (as yet unimplemented) geocoding tools is proposed and described in the paper...|$|R
40|$|Alphanumeric use {{of phone}} numbers means {{selecting}} phone {{numbers on the}} basis of a relationship between numbers and letters. The number 0800 -TELECOM, for example, corresponds with the number series 0800 - 8353266. Alphanumeric use primarily concerns service numbers, which are toll-free numbers or numbers for premium services. This article describes <b>alphanumeric</b> use and <b>addresses</b> a few specific regulatory issues. ...|$|R
