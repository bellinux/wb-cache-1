5|$|By the 18th century, {{four types}} of {{midshipman}} existed: midshipman (original rating), midshipman extraordinary, midshipman (<b>apprentice</b> <b>officer),</b> and midshipman ordinary. Some midshipmen were older men, and while most were officer candidates who failed to pass the lieutenant examination or were passed over for promotion, {{some members of the}} original rating served, as late as 1822, alongside apprentice officers without themselves aspiring to a commission. By 1794, all midshipmen were considered officer candidates, and the original rating was phased out.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, a {{midshipman}} was {{a rating}} for an experienced seaman, {{and the word}} derives from the area aboard a ship, amidships, either where the original rating worked on the ship, or where he was berthed. Beginning in the 18th century, a commissioned officer candidate was rated as a midshipman, and the seaman rating began to slowly die out. By the Napoleonic era (1793–1815), a midshipman was an <b>apprentice</b> <b>officer</b> who had previously served {{at least three years}} as a volunteer, officer's servant or able seaman, and was roughly equivalent to a present-day petty officer in rank and responsibilities. After serving at least three years as a midshipman or master's mate, he was eligible to take the examination for lieutenant. Promotion to lieutenant was not automatic, and many midshipmen took positions as master's mates for an increase in pay and responsibility aboard ship. Midshipmen in the United States Navy were trained and served similarly to midshipman in the Royal Navy, although unlike their counterparts in the Royal Navy, a midshipman was a warrant officer rank until 1912.|$|E

Volunteers were paid £6 per year. By 1816, the rating of midshipman ordinary was phased out, and all <b>apprentice</b> <b>officers</b> were rated as midshipmen.|$|R

50|$|Slightly after midnight, Second Officer Herbert Stone took {{watch from}} Groves. He testified that he, too, {{observed}} the ship, judging {{it to be}} about five miles away. He tried signalling her with the Morse lamp, also without success. <b>Apprentice</b> <b>officer</b> James Gibson, who had been doing the Morse signalling, testified that at 00:55, Stone {{told him he had}} observed five rockets in the sky above the nearby ship. Stone testified that he had informed Captain Lord, although the British inquiry did not ask whether or not he communicated the number. Lord asked if the rockets had been a company signal, but Stone did not know. Lord and Stone both testified that Stone reported they were not distress signals. Lord ordered Stone to tell him if anything about the ship changed, to keep signaling it with the Morse lamp, but did not order that it be contacted by wireless.|$|E
5000|$|In 1729, the Royal Naval Academy in Portsmouth, {{renamed the}} Royal Naval College in 1806, was founded, for 40 {{students}} between 13 and 16, {{who would take}} three years to complete a course of study defined in an illustrated book. [...] After graduation students served on ships as midshipmen. [...] The rating was used specifically for graduates of the Royal Naval College to distinguish them from midshipmen who had served previously aboard a ship, and were paid less than midshipmen. By 1816, the rating of midshipman ordinary was phased out, and all <b>apprentice</b> <b>officers</b> were rated as midshipmen.

40|$|The {{completion}} of ECDIS mandatory implementation period on-board SOLAS vessels requires certain operational, functional and educational gaping holes to be solved. It especially refers to positioning and its redundancy, which represents fundamental safety factor on-board navigating vessels. The proposed paper deals with {{primary and secondary}} positioning used in ECDIS system. Standard positioning methods are described, discussing possibilities of obtained positions’ automatic and manual implementation in ECDIS, beside default methods. With the aim of emphasizing the need and importance of using secondary positioning source in ECDIS, positioning issue {{from the standpoint of}} end-users was elaborated, representing a practical feedback of elaborated topic. The survey was conducted in the form of international questionnaire placed among OOWs, ranging from <b>apprentice</b> <b>officers</b> to captains. The result answers and discussion regarding (non) usage of secondary positioning sources in ECDIS were analysed and presented. Answers and statements were elaborated focusing not only in usage of the secondary positioning system in ECDIS, but in navigation in general. The study revealed potential risks arising from the lack of knowledge and even negligence. The paper concludes with summary of findings related to discrepancies between theoretical background, good seamanship practice and real actions taken by OOWs. Further research activities are pointed out, together with planned practical actions in raising awareness regarding navigation with ECDIS...|$|R

50|$|The period saw {{a generational}} change in weapons and {{equipment}} on issue to ADGs; jungle green uniforms {{were replaced by}} the Disruptive Pattern Combat Uniform (DPCU), the L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle (SLR), M16 and F1 Sub-Machine Gun were replaced by the F88 Austeyr assault rifle and Vietnam-era radios were replaced with the Raven series of VHF and HF sets. ADGs continued to deliver weapon and ground defence training to RAAF personnel and provided the majority of instructors for recruit, <b>apprentice</b> and initial <b>officer</b> training. The scope of this role, the longest and most continuous of the ADG mustering and its predecessors, may be gauged by the delivery of conversion training from the L1A1 SLR to the F88 rifle for {{every member of the}} RAAF; {{at the same time the}} Ground Defence Training Sections, manned on each base by 3-5 ADGs and GRDEFOs, commenced delivery of additional ground defence training for all RAAF members as the service transitioned to an expeditionary role.|$|R
5000|$|The Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition {{comprised}} two parties.

A second party under Aeneas Mackintosh in Aurora would be landed at a Ross Sea base, {{with the task of}} laying supply depots along the expected route of the latter stages of Shackletons march, a mission which Shackleton thought straightforward. [...] Shackleton devoted little time to the details of the Ross Sea operation; thus, on arriving in Australia to take up his appointment, Mackintosh found himself faced with an unseaworthy ship and no funds to rectify the situation. Aurora, though strongly built, was 40 years old and had recently returned from Douglas Mawsons Australasian Antarctic Expedition in need of an extensive refit. After the intervention of the eminent Australian polar scientist Edgeworth David the Australian government provided money and dockyard facilities to make Aurora fit for further Antarctic service.Of the Ross Sea party that eventually sailed from Australia in December 1914, only Mackintosh, Ernest Joyce {{who was in charge of}} the dogs, and the ships boatswain James [...] "Scotty" [...] Paton had significant experience of Antarctic conditions.
