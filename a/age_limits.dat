25|$|The {{qualifications}} {{for women who}} wished to become members of the WR were quite stringent. The eligibility requirements for officer candidates and enlisted women were similar: United States citizenship; not married to a marine; either single or married but with no children under 18; height not less than 60inches; weight not less than 95pounds; good vision and good teeth. For enlisted members, the <b>age</b> <b>limits</b> were from 20 to 35, and an applicant was required {{to have at least}} two years of high school. For officer candidates, the <b>age</b> <b>limits</b> were from 20 to 49, either a college graduate, or having a combination of two years of college and two years of work experience. Later, the wives of enlisted marines were allowed to join, and enlisted women could marry after boot camp.|$|E

25|$|The Intermediate (50/70) Division, {{which had}} {{operated}} on a pilot basis since the 2011 season, was announced {{as an official}} Little League division, the first new division since 1999. The division, which launched fully in the 2013 season, has the same <b>age</b> <b>limits</b> as standard Little League but extends the pitching rubber to 50 feet from home plate and features bases 70 feet apart.

25|$|Butt {{started in}} the Under-17s and quickly progressed through Under-19 level, {{although}} at that time he was much younger than the <b>age</b> <b>limits</b> suggest, making his senior debut for Lahore Whites in 2000 aged only 15. His talent was noticed immediately, which led to him being given {{a place in the}} Pakistan A team against England soon after. However, instead of rushing straight for the limelight of international cricket, he got his head down and consolidated by playing consistently for his region and the youth teams, until the Pakistan selectors finally drafted him in 2003.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the investigation, ten members of the IOC were {{expelled}} and another ten were sanctioned. This was the first expulsion or sanction for corruption in the more than a century the IOC had existed. Although nothing strictly illegal had been done, it was felt that the acceptance of the gifts was morally dubious. Stricter rules were adopted for future bids, and caps were put into place as to how much IOC members could accept from bid cities. Additionally, new term and <b>age</b> <b>limits</b> were put into place for IOC membership, and fifteen former Olympic athletes were added to the committee.|$|E
25|$|The Confederate Congress {{made several}} more {{amendments}} {{over the course}} of the war to address losses suffered in battle as well as the North's greater supply of manpower. In December 1863, they abolished the practice of allowing a rich drafted man to hire a substitute to take his place in the ranks. Substitution had also been practiced in the Northern states, leading to similar resentment from the lower classes. In February 1864, the <b>age</b> <b>limits</b> were extended to between 17 and 50. Challenges to the subsequent acts came before five state supreme courts; all five upheld them.|$|E

25|$|The Third Modification Law (1974) {{extended}} individual entitlements {{to social}} assistance {{by means of}} higher-income limits compatible with receipt of benefits and lowered <b>age</b> <b>limits</b> for certain special benefits. Rehabilitation measures were also extended, child supplements were expressed as percentages of standard amounts and were thus indexed to their changes, and grandparents of recipients were exempted from potential liability to reimburse expenditure of social assistance carrier. The Third Social Welfare Amendment Act (1974) brought considerable improvements for the handicapped, those in need of care, and older persons, and a new fund of 100 million marks for disabled children was established. Allowances for retraining and advanced training and for refugees from East Germany were also increased, together with federal grants for sport. In addition, increases {{were made in the}} pensions of 2.5 million war victims. Following a sudden increase in the price of oil, a law was passed in December 1973 granting recipients of social assistance and housing allowances a single heating-oil allowance (a procedure repeated in the winter of 1979 during the Schmidt Administration). Improvements and automatic adjustments of maintenance allowances for participants in vocational training measures were also carried out, and increased allowances were provided for training and retraining, together with special allowances for refugees from East Germany.|$|E
25|$|Elsewhere in Europe the {{motorized}} bicycle {{continued to}} be popular, particularly in France and Italy. An Italian manufacturer, Vincenti Piatti, designed a 50cc engine for driving portable lathes and this was also used to power a bicycle frame {{in the form of}} the Mini Motore. Piatti later licensed the design to Trojan for production in Britain as the Trojan Minimotor. In West Germany, a compression-ignition (diesel) engine kit using an 18cc variable head engine made by Lohmann was produced during the 1950s. In France, where postwar reconstruction, taxes, and fuel shortages limited automobile access, motorized bicycle kits and complete models were produced by a variety of smaller manufacturers, often using a two-stroke gasoline engine mounted above the front wheel. In 1946, production of the very successful French VELOSOLEX commenced, continuing until 1988. The VéloSoleX was a mass-produced motorized bicycle that used a tire roller (friction drive) to the front wheel. After French production ceased, the VELOSOLEX {{continued to be}} produced in China and Hungary. An in-wheel gasoline engine was used on the Honda P50 moped, which ceased production in 1968. The velomoteur and motor scooter enjoyed a second renaissance in the 1960s and 1970s as a new generation of youth discovered they could ride a motorized vehicle without need of a driver's license. Other countries had relaxed licensing requirements, e.g. lower <b>age</b> <b>limits</b> for motorized bicycles, which increased their popularity.|$|E
25|$|Barth {{was given}} an honourable {{discharge}} from the Norwegian Armed Forces on 15 April 1952. His last military position was at Fossumstrøket Fortress. Barth had applied unsuccessfully for several positions during his last seven years in the Norwegian Armed Forces, {{the first of his}} post-war applications being to the position of general inspector and commander of the Norwegian coastal artillery service in 1945. In 1946, the officer appointed to the position for which Barth had applied the previous year, Colonel Gunnar Isaachsen Willoch, recommended that Barth should be promoted to the rank of colonel and given command of the coastal artillery in Western Norway. However, due to a bureaucratic mistake Barth was considered by the Commanding Admiral of the Royal Norwegian Navy, Admiral Elias Corneliussen, to be disqualified due to his age and another officer given the position. Admiral Corneliussen and army general Halvor Hansson had interpreted the age regulations for promotion to the rank of colonel without taking into account Barth's war service, which would have enabled him to be qualified for a promotion despite his age. Barth sent a written complaint after being disqualified. A parliamentary investigative commission concluded months later that Barth had been qualified for the position, and should be considered for other similar positions. Barth's case was brought up at the Storting (Parliament of Norway) in 1948 by Conservative Party politician Carl P. Wright, who stated that Barth should be given the next coastal artillery position that became available. Minister of Defence Jens Christian Hauge replied to Wright's statement by pointing out that Barth had been removed from consideration quite early in the process in 1946 due to the mistake made regarding <b>age</b> <b>limits,</b> but that he was now free to apply for and be considered for any military position. Wright brought up once more the cases of Barth and several other officers who claimed to have been unreasonably bypassed, in 1949. In 1948 Barth applied unsuccessfully for the position of commander of Coastal Artillery Brigade Eastern Norway. The next year he applied unsuccessfully for the position of director of the Norwegian Defence University College, and also for the position as military attaché at the Norwegian embassies in Copenhagen and Stockholm. He died on 23 April 1972 at the age of 80, having lived at Akersborg terrasse in Oslo. He was buried on 5 June 1972 at Vestre Aker Cemetery in Oslo.|$|E

500|$|Skelton and Marcel Marceau {{shared a}} long {{friendship}} and admiration of each other's work. [...] Marceau appeared on Skelton's CBS television show three times, including one turn {{as the host}} in 1961 as Skelton recovered from surgery. He was also a guest on the three Funny Faces specials that Skelton produced for HBO. [...] In a TV Guide interview after Skelton's death, Marceau said, [...] "Red, you are eternal for me and {{the millions of people}} you made laugh and cry. [...] May God bless you forever, my great and precious companion. [...] I will never forget that silent world we created together."

500|$|The {{process for}} {{awarding}} host city honours came under intense scrutiny after Salt Lake City had been awarded {{the right to}} host the 2002 Games. [...] Soon after the host city had been announced {{it was discovered that}} the organisers had engaged in an elaborate bribery scheme to curry favour with IOC officials. Gifts and other financial considerations were given to those who would evaluate and vote on Salt Lake City's bid. These gifts included medical treatment for relatives, a college scholarship for one member's son and a land deal in Utah. Even IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch received two rifles valued at $2,000. Samaranch defended the gift as inconsequential since, as president, he was a non-voting member. [...] The subsequent investigation uncovered inconsistencies in the bids for every Games (both summer and winter) since 1988. For example, the gifts received by IOC members from the Japanese Organising Committee for Nagano's bid for the 1998 Winter Olympics were described by the investigation committee as [...] "astronomical". Although nothing strictly illegal had been done, the IOC feared that corporate sponsors would lose faith in the integrity of the process and that the Olympic brand would be tarnished {{to such an extent that}} advertisers would begin to pull their support. [...] The investigation resulted in the expulsion of 10 IOC members and the sanctioning of another 10. New terms and <b>age</b> <b>limits</b> were established for IOC membership, and 15 former Olympic athletes were added to the committee. Stricter rules for future bids were imposed, with ceilings imposed on the value of gifts IOC members could accept from bid cities.|$|E
