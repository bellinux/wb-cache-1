5|$|In mathematics, {{constructions of}} {{mathematical}} objects are needed, {{which is also}} the case for stochastic processes, to prove that they exist mathematically. There <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>main</b> approaches for constructing a stochastic process.

5|$|Myrrh is a bitter-tasting, aromatic, {{yellow to}} reddish brown gum.

5|$|Two {{types of}} neuron play {{dominant}} {{roles in the}} cerebellar circuit: Purkinje cells and granule cells. Three types of axons also play dominant roles: mossy fibers and climbing fibers (which enter the cerebellum from outside), and parallel fibers (which are the axons of granule cells). There <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>main</b> pathways through the cerebellar circuit, originating from mossy fibers and climbing fibers, both eventually terminating in the deep cerebellar nuclei.|$|E
5|$|As is {{discussed}} below, {{the reason for}} the delay was probably simply that neither the Athenians nor the Persians were willing to risk battle initially. This then raises the question of why the battle occurred when it did.

5|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} process {{that uses a}} toothed tool, called a broach, to remove material. There <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>main</b> types of broaching: linear and rotary. In linear broaching, which is the more common process, the broach is run linearly against a surface of the workpiece to effect the cut. Linear broaches are used in a broaching machine, which is also sometimes shortened to broach. In rotary broaching, the broach is rotated and pressed into the workpiece to cut an axisymmetric shape. A rotary broach is used in a lathe or screw machine. In both processes the cut is performed in one pass of the broach, which makes it very efficient.|$|E
5|$|Central to {{the plot}} of the game <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>main</b> {{characters}}, Ramza Beoulve and Delita Heiral. The two characters are childhood friends, and while both are born of differing social classes; Ramza a noble and Delita a commoner, both disregarded this fact and grew up together believing in justice and honor, as taught by Ramza's father Balbanes. However, as the story progresses, the two characters faced many conflicts that changed their viewpoint on life; Delita seeks to manipulate the upper class to achieve his dreams, while Ramza believes in justice and honor regardless of name and class.|$|E
