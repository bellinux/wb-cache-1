5|$|Both {{internal}} and external signals {{can lead to the}} induction of <b>apoptosis,</b> or programmed cell death. The resulting deconstruction of cellular components is primarily carried out by specialized proteases known as caspases, but the proteasome also plays important and diverse roles in the apoptotic process. The involvement of the proteasome in this process is indicated by both the increase in protein ubiquitination, and of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes that is observed well in advance of <b>apoptosis.</b> During <b>apoptosis,</b> proteasomes localized to the nucleus have also been observed to translocate to outer membrane blebs characteristic of <b>apoptosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|When a cell's DNA {{is damaged}} by a virus, {{and if the}} cell cannot repair itself, this often {{triggers}} <b>apoptosis.</b> One {{of the results of}} <b>apoptosis</b> is destruction of the damaged DNA by the cell itself. Some viruses have mechanisms to limit <b>apoptosis</b> so that the host cell does not die before progeny viruses have been produced; HIV, for example, does this.|$|E
5|$|<b>Apoptosis</b> is a {{controlled}} {{process in which}} the cell's structural components are destroyed, resulting in death of the cell. Changes associated with <b>apoptosis</b> directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example, in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope and lamina. The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic proteases called caspases, which cleave the lamin proteins and, thus, degrade the nucleus' structural integrity. Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in assays for early apoptotic activity. Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to <b>apoptosis,</b> suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus. Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of <b>apoptosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Proteasome inhibitors have {{effective}} anti-tumor {{activity in}} cell culture, inducing <b>apoptosis</b> by disrupting the regulated degradation of pro-growth cell cycle proteins. This approach of selectively inducing <b>apoptosis</b> in tumor cells has proven effective in animal models and human trials.|$|E
25|$|Dysregulation of <b>apoptosis</b> (programmed cell death) is {{believed}} {{to play a role}} in the pathogenesis of a variety of autoimmune diseases, though its role in SS is controversial. Both the Fas and Fas ligand proteins are overexpressed in primary SS patients, while expression of BCL-1, which is known to downregulate <b>apoptosis,</b> was found to be significantly reduced in acinar and ductal epithelial cells of SS patients compared to healthy people. In situ studies did not show increased <b>apoptosis</b> among glandular epithelial cells, but did show reduced <b>apoptosis</b> among infiltrating mononuclear cells. Reduced <b>apoptosis</b> was also implicated in the accumulation of autoreactive B-cells found in the glands. The relationship of autoantibodies expressed in SS with <b>apoptosis</b> is still being researched.|$|E
25|$|The mitosis {{promoting}} factor MPF also regulates DNA-damage induced <b>apoptosis.</b> Negative {{regulation of}} MPF by WEE1 causes aberrant mitosis and thus resistance to DNA-damage induced <b>apoptosis.</b> Kruppel-like factor2 (KLF2) negatively regulates human WEE1, thus increasing sensitivity to DNA-damage induced <b>apoptosis</b> in cancer cells.|$|E
25|$|Some {{factors like}} Fas receptors and caspases promote <b>apoptosis,</b> while {{some members of}} the Bcl-2 family of {{proteins}} inhibit <b>apoptosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{order for}} <b>apoptosis</b> to occur within OROV, viral uncoating, viral internalization, {{along with the}} {{replication}} of cells is necessary. <b>Apoptosis</b> in some viruses is activated by extracellular stimuli. However, {{studies have demonstrated that}} the OROV infection causes <b>apoptosis</b> to be activated through intracellular stimuli and involves the mitochondria.|$|E
25|$|The main {{method of}} {{treatment}} for death from signaling-related diseases involves either increasing or decreasing the susceptibility of <b>apoptosis</b> in diseased cells, {{depending on whether the}} disease is caused by either the inhibition of or excess <b>apoptosis.</b> For instance, treatments aim to restore <b>apoptosis</b> to treat diseases with deficient cell death, and to increase the apoptotic threshold to treat diseases involved with excessive cell death. To stimulate <b>apoptosis,</b> one can increase the number of death receptor ligands (such as TNF or TRAIL), antagonize the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 pathway, or introduce Smac mimetics to inhibit the inhibitor (IAPs). The addition of agents such as Herceptin, Iressa, or Gleevec works to stop cells from cycling and causes <b>apoptosis</b> activation by blocking growth and survival signaling further upstream. Finally, adding p53-MDM2 complexes displaces p53 and activates the p53 pathway, leading to cell cycle arrest and <b>apoptosis.</b> Many different methods can be used either to stimulate or to inhibit <b>apoptosis</b> in various places along the death signaling pathway.|$|E
25|$|TIGAR cannot prevent <b>apoptosis</b> via death {{pathways}} {{that are}} independent from ROS and p53. In some cells, TIGAR expression can push cells further towards <b>apoptosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{action of}} the TIGAR/HK2 complex only protects cells from <b>apoptosis</b> under low oxygen conditions. Under normal or glucose starved conditions, TIGAR {{mediated}} protection from <b>apoptosis</b> comes from its bis-phosphatase activity alone.|$|E
25|$|The {{cytotoxic}} {{nature of}} ROS is {{a driving force}} behind <b>apoptosis,</b> but in even higher amounts, ROS can result in both <b>apoptosis</b> and necrosis, a form of uncontrolled cell death, in cancer cells.|$|E
25|$|A cancer cell can die {{in three}} ways: <b>apoptosis,</b> {{necrosis}} and autophagy. Excessive ROS can induce <b>apoptosis</b> through both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. In the extrinsic pathway of <b>apoptosis,</b> ROS are generated by Fas ligand as an upstream event for Fas activation via phosphorylation, which {{is necessary for}} subsequent recruitment of Fas-associated protein with death domain and caspase 8 as well as <b>apoptosis</b> induction. In the intrinsic pathway, ROS function to facilitate cytochrome c release by activating pore-stabilizing proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) as well as inhibiting pore-destabilizing proteins (Bcl-2-associated X protein, Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer). The intrinsic pathway {{is also known as}} the caspase cascade and is induced through mitochondrial damage which triggers the release of cytochrome c. DNA damage, oxidative stress, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential lead to the release of the pro-apoptotic proteins mentioned above stimulating <b>apoptosis.</b> Mitochondrial damage is closely linked to <b>apoptosis</b> and since mitochondria are easily targeted there is potential for cancer therapy.|$|E
25|$|Accordingly, coexpression of {{anti-apoptotic}} proteins such as Mcl-1 suppresses <b>apoptosis</b> {{induced by}} Bok overexpression. Consistent {{with the results}} mentioned above, coexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 does not prevent Bok-induced <b>apoptosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dendritic cell <b>apoptosis</b> – {{immune system}} cells called {{dendritic}} cells present antigens to active lymphocytes. Dendritic {{cells that are}} defective in <b>apoptosis</b> can lead to inappropriate systemic lymphocyte activation and consequent decline in self-tolerance.|$|E
25|$|Autophagy and <b>apoptosis</b> are two {{different}} cell death mechanisms brought on by high levels of ROS in the cells, however; autophagy and <b>apoptosis</b> rarely act through strictly independent pathways. There is a clear connection between ROS and autophagy and a correlation seen between excessive amounts of ROS leading to <b>apoptosis.</b> The depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane is also characteristic of the initiation of autophagy. When mitochondria are damaged and begin to release ROS, autophagy is initiated {{to dispose of the}} damaging organelle. If a drug targets mitochondria and creates ROS, autophagy may dispose of so many mitochondria and other damaged organelles that the cell is no longer viable. The extensive amount of ROS and mitochondrial damage may also signal for <b>apoptosis.</b> The balance of autophagy within the cell and the crosstalk between autophagy and <b>apoptosis</b> mediated by ROS is crucial for a cell’s survival. This crosstalk and connection between autophagy and <b>apoptosis</b> could be a mechanism targeted by cancer therapies or used in combination therapies for highly resistant cancers.|$|E
25|$|Cross linking {{antibody}} induced aggregation of Thy1 cause {{death of}} thymocytes and mesangial cells mainly by <b>apoptosis</b> despite Bcl2 upregulation. The death of mesangial cells {{seems to be}} <b>apoptosis</b> by TUNEL staining or annexin V staining, but electron microscopy suggest it is necrosis.|$|E
25|$|The second pathway is a {{secondary}} form of necrosis that {{is shown to}} occur after <b>apoptosis</b> and budding. Cellular changes of necrosis occur in this secondary form of <b>apoptosis,</b> where the nucleus breaks into fragments, which is known as karyorrhexis.|$|E
25|$|Another {{independent}} {{approach is}} to use oligoadenylated anti-telomerase antisense oligonucleotides and ribozymes to target telomerase RNA, inducing dissociation and <b>apoptosis</b> (Figure 5). The fast induction of <b>apoptosis</b> through antisense binding {{may be a good}} alternative to the slower telomere shortening.|$|E
25|$|<b>Apoptosis</b> or Type I cell-death.|$|E
25|$|On the {{molecular}} level, calcium influx {{is not the}} only factor responsible for <b>apoptosis</b> induced by excitoxicity. Recently, it has been noted that extrasynaptic NMDA receptor activation, triggered by both glutamate exposure or hypoxic/ischemic conditions, activate a CREB (cAMP response element binding) protein shut-off, which in turn caused loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and <b>apoptosis.</b> On the other hand, activation of synaptic NMDA receptors activated only the CREB pathway, which activates BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), not activating <b>apoptosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The PI3k/Akt {{signaling}} cascade {{works with}} the transforming growth factor beta/SMAD signaling cascade to ensure prostate cancer cell survival and protection against <b>apoptosis.</b> X-linked inhibitor of <b>apoptosis</b> (XIAP) is hypothesized to promote prostate cancer cell survival and growth and is a target of research because if this inhibitor can be shut down then the <b>apoptosis</b> cascade can carry on its function in preventing cancer cell proliferation. Macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1) stimulates the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling pathway which leads to prostate cancer cell growth and survival.|$|E
25|$|In {{multiple}} myeloma, TIGAR {{expression is}} linked to the activity of MUC-1. MUC-1 is an oncoprotein that is overexpressed in multiple myeloma and protects these cells from ROS-induced <b>apoptosis</b> by maintaining TIGAR activity. When MUC-1 activity is removed, levels of TIGAR decline and cells undergo ROS-induced <b>apoptosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Stress stimuli such as radiation, {{nutrient}} deprivation or oxygen deprivation {{which causes}} <b>apoptosis</b> {{will lead to}} fragmentation of chromatin and cause most cells to apoptose. However a small subset of cells will survive <b>apoptosis.</b> This cleaved DNA will require repair, and when this is done incorrectly, rearrangements will be introduced into the chromosome. There is currently speculation that chromothripsis might be driven by viruses such as -herpes viruses which cause cancer, possibly by the inhibition of <b>apoptosis.</b> However this speculation requires further investigation.|$|E
25|$|Research on <b>apoptosis</b> has {{increased}} substantially {{since the early}} 1990s. In addition to its importance as a biological phenomenon, defective apoptotic processes have been implicated {{in a wide variety}} of diseases. Excessive <b>apoptosis</b> causes atrophy, whereas an insufficient amount results in uncontrolled cell proliferation, such as cancer.|$|E
25|$|The Oropouche virus (OROV) {{is found}} in the family Bunyaviridae. The study of <b>apoptosis</b> brought on by Bunyaviridae was {{initiated}} in 1996, when it was observed that <b>apoptosis</b> was induced by the La Crosse virus into the kidney cells of baby hamsters and into the brains of baby mice.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to necrosis, {{which is a}} form of traumatic cell death that results from acute cellular injury, <b>apoptosis</b> is a highly regulated and controlled process that confers advantages during an organism's lifecycle. For example, the separation of fingers and toes in a developing human embryo occurs because cells between the digits undergo <b>apoptosis.</b> Unlike necrosis, <b>apoptosis</b> produces cell fragments called apoptotic bodies that phagocytic cells are able to engulf and quickly remove before the contents of the cell can spill out onto surrounding cells and cause damage to the neighboring cells.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a higher}} rate of <b>apoptosis</b> in people with SLE and various changes in genes and {{proteins}} have been implicated in the defects in <b>apoptosis.</b> These include increased levels of soluble Fas and bcl-2 and polymorphisms in the programmed cell death 1 and run-related transcription factor X1.|$|E
25|$|<b>Apoptosis.</b> During {{programmed}} {{cell death}} the ICE/ced-3 family of proteases (one of the interleukin-1β-converter proteases) degrade actin into two fragments “in vivo”; one of the fragments is 15 kDa and the other 31 kDa. This {{represents one of the}} mechanisms involved in destroying cell viability that form the basis of <b>apoptosis.</b> The protease calpain has also been shown to be involved in this type of cell destruction; just as the use of calpain inhibitors has been shown to decrease actin proteolysis and the degradation of DNA (another of the characteristic elements of <b>apoptosis).</b> On the other hand, the stress-induced triggering of <b>apoptosis</b> causes the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (which also involves its polymerization), giving rise to structures called stress fibers; this is activated by the MAP kinase pathway.|$|E
25|$|Atromentin induces <b>apoptosis</b> {{in human}} leukemia U937 cells.|$|E
25|$|German {{scientist}} Karl Vogt {{was first}} to describe the principle of <b>apoptosis</b> in 1842. In 1885, anatomist Walther Flemming delivered a more precise description {{of the process of}} programmed cell death. However, it was not until 1965 that the topic was resurrected. While studying tissues using electron microscopy, John Foxton Ross Kerr at University of Queensland was able to distinguish <b>apoptosis</b> from traumatic cell death. Following the publication of a paper describing the phenomenon, Kerr was invited to join Alastair R. Currie, as well as Andrew Wyllie, who was Currie's graduate student, at University of Aberdeen. In 1972, the trio published a seminal article in the British Journal of Cancer. Kerr had initially used the term programmed cell necrosis, but in the article, the process of natural cell death was called <b>apoptosis.</b> Kerr, Wyllie and Currie credited James Cormack, a professor of Greek language at University of Aberdeen, with suggesting the term <b>apoptosis.</b> Kerr received the Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize on March 14, 2000, for his description of <b>apoptosis.</b> He shared the prize with Boston biologist H. Robert Horvitz.|$|E
25|$|Necroptosis is {{specific}} to vertebrates {{and may have}} originated as an additional defense to pathogens. Necroptosis also acts as an alternative “fail-safe” cell death pathway in cases where cells are unable to undergo <b>apoptosis,</b> such as during viral infection in which <b>apoptosis</b> signaling proteins are blocked by the virus.|$|E
25|$|Necrosis is {{the death}} of a cell caused by {{external}} factors such as trauma or infection and occurs in several different forms. Recently a form of programmed necrosis, called necroptosis, has been recognized as an alternate form of programmed cell death. It is hypothesized that necroptosis can serve as a cell-death backup to <b>apoptosis</b> when the <b>apoptosis</b> signaling is blocked by endogenous or exogenous factors such as viruses or mutations. Most recently, other types of regulated necrosis have been discovered as well, which share several signaling events with necroptosis and <b>apoptosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|PEDF induces PPAR-gamma {{expression}} {{which in}} turn induces p53, a tumor suppressor gene involved in cell cycle regulation and <b>apoptosis.</b> Thrombospondin, an antiangiogenic protein, is upregulated by PEDF. PEDF stimulates several other well known signaling cascades such as the Ras pathway, the NF-κB pathway, and extrinsic <b>apoptosis</b> cascades.|$|E
25|$|Ras {{proteins}} {{function as}} binary molecular switches that control intracellular signaling networks. Ras-regulated signal pathways control such processes as actin cytoskeletal integrity, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell adhesion, <b>apoptosis,</b> and cell migration. Ras and Ras-related proteins are often deregulated in cancers, leading to increased invasion and metastasis, and decreased <b>apoptosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{decrease}} in H202 {{as a result}} of TIGAR activity protects against <b>apoptosis.</b>|$|E
