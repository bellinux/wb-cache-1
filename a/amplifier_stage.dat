25|$|The first <b>amplifier</b> <b>stage</b> is a {{preamplifier}}. It amplifies {{the audio}} signal {{to a level}} that can drive the power stage. The preamplifier also changes {{the tone of the}} signal; high preamp settings add overdrive. The power amplifier produces a high current signal to drive a loudspeaker and produce sound.|$|E
25|$|Amplified {{instruments}} {{simplify the}} design of the series and shunt resistor networks. The internal resistance of the coil is decoupled from the selection of the series and shunt range resistors; the series network thus becomes a voltage divider. Where AC measurements are required, the rectifier can be placed after the <b>amplifier</b> <b>stage,</b> improving precision at low range.|$|E
25|$|A power {{amplifier}} is an amplifier designed primarily {{to increase the}} power available to a load. In practice, amplifier power gain depends on the source and load impedances, {{as well as the}} inherent voltage and current gain. A radio frequency (RF) amplifier design typically optimizes impedances for power transfer, while audio and instrumentation amplifier designs normally optimize input and output impedance for least loading and highest signal integrity. An amplifier that is said to have a gain of 20dB might have a voltage gain of 20dB and an available power gain of much more than 20dB (power ratio of 100)—yet actually deliver a much lower power gain if, for example, the input is from a 600Ω microphone and the output connects to a 47kΩ input socket for a {{power amplifier}}. In general the power amplifier is the last 'amplifier' or actual circuit in a signal chain (the output stage) and is the <b>amplifier</b> <b>stage</b> that requires attention to power efficiency. Efficiency considerations lead to the various classes of power amplifier based on the biasing of the output transistors or tubes: see power amplifier classes below.|$|E
50|$|The TR-1 was a {{superheterodyne}} receiver made with four n-p-n transistors and one diode. It contained a single transistor converter stage, {{followed by two}} intermediate-frequency <b>amplifier</b> <b>stages.</b> After detection, a single-transistor stage amplified the sound frequency. All <b>amplifier</b> <b>stages</b> used common emitter <b>amplifiers.</b> <b>Stages</b> were transformer coupled, with tuned transformers for the intermediate frequency amplifiers and a miniature audio transformer for the loudspeaker. The intermediate frequency transformers were paired with capacitors, and hand tuned to the intermediate frequency (262 kHz) using movable cores.|$|R

2500|$|The Novice class {{created by}} the 1951 {{decision}} was the entry-level license; it remained the primary entry license until the Morse code requirement was eliminated for Technician licenses in 1990. [...] On HF it permitted code transmissions only, with a maximum power of 75 watts, (input to the transmitter's final <b>amplifier</b> <b>stage)</b> on limited segments of the 80, 40 and 15 meter bands, and on VHF, both code and voice privileges on 145–147MHz. [...] Initially, they were also limited to crystal control of the transmitting frequency, a restriction that was lifted in 1972. At the same time, the Novice CW bands were shifted on the 40m band {{and access to the}} 2m voice/code was revoked and a code segment on the 10m band was added. To qualify for a Novice license, a candidate would have to pass a 5 word-per-minute (WPM) Morse code test (send and receive) and a 25- (later 30-) question multiple-choice test. [...] The Novice Class license was valid for one year, as it was intended only as an entry level; within the year, the Novice was expected to move up to General (or Conditional). Under incentive licensing in the 60s, the term of the Novice class was extended to two years. In 1978 the Novice changed into a renewable license with the same five-year validity as other classes.|$|E

5000|$|The circuit was {{developed}} about 1922 by Harold Wheeler {{who worked in}} Louis Hazeltine's laboratory at Stevens Institute of Technology, so Hazeltine is usually given the credit. [...] The tuned radio frequency (TRF) receiver, {{one of the most}} popular radio receiver designs of the time, consisted of several tuned radio frequency (RF) <b>amplifier</b> <b>stages,</b> followed by a detector and several audio <b>amplifier</b> <b>stages.</b> A major defect of the TRF receiver was that, due to the high interelectrode capacitance of early triode vacuum tubes, feedback within the RF <b>amplifier</b> <b>stages</b> gave them a tendency to oscillate, creating unwanted radio frequency alternating currents. These parasitic oscillations mixed with the carrier wave in the detector, creating heterodynes (beat notes) in the audio frequency range, which were heard as annoying whistles and howls from the speaker.|$|R

50|$|A {{modulation}} transformer is an audio-frequency transformer {{that forms}} {{a major part}} of most AM transmitters. The primary winding of a modulation transformer is fed by an audio amplifier that has about 1/2 of the rated input power of the transmitter's final <b>amplifier</b> <b>stage.</b> The secondary winding is in series with the power supply of that final radio-frequency <b>amplifier</b> <b>stage,</b> thereby allowing the audio signal to lower and raise the instantaneous DC supply voltage of the power amplifier (PA) tube or transistor. Considering that the PA device is operated as a class-C amplifier, i.e. as a switch, the modulation transformer is responsible for the amplitude modulation (AM) of the transmitter.|$|E
