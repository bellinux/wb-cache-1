40|$|Although {{alcohol abuse}} {{is the most}} common cause of liver {{cirrhosis}} in the United States, the enhancing effects of alcohol on the long-term prognosis of hepatitis C virus (HCV) related liver cirrhosis has not been clarified. To investigate how alcohol abuse influences the prognosis of hepatitis virus related liver cirrhosis, we studied 716 Japanese patients. Cumulative survival and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development rates were analyzed in alcohol abusive, cirrhotic patients with or without hepatitis virus infection. Patients who abused alcohol were younger (p< 0. 0001) than HCV infected, non-abusive patients. The overall survival rate among patients with alcoholic cirrhosis (<b>Al</b> <b>group),</b> HCV related cirrhosis (HCV group), and HCV infected + alcoholic cirrhosis (HCV + Al group), showed no significant differences, although the 10 -year cumulative survival rate of <b>Al</b> <b>group</b> was the highest of the three groups. The HCC development rate of <b>Al</b> <b>group</b> was the lowest. In addition, alcohol abuse decreased the survival rates of HCV group in the early stage with no HCC (p =  0. 0028). In conclusion, alcohol abuse might affect the progression of liver damage in HCV infected patients with liver cirrhosis in the early stage, although the influence of alcohol abuse on the long term prognosis seems to be rather small...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare two groups of patients with total knee modular megaprosthesis and osteochondral allograft through an objective analysis. Eighteen patients, ten treated with prosthesis (TKR group) and eight with osteochondral allografts (<b>AL</b> <b>group),</b> were included in the study. X-ray, muscular strength measurements, and studies of gait analysis including electromyography (EMG) were used to compare functional results of patients. In the TKR group a higher incidence of knee extension lag was found. While the TKR group had a prevalent knee stiff/hyperextension pattern with reduced rectus femoris activity, the <b>AL</b> <b>group</b> had a higher percentage of normal knee pattern. Knee extensor muscular strength was reduced in the TKR group. TKR functional performance during gait is in most cases abnormal, consistent with the weakness of the extensor apparatus and knee extension lag.

Interim necropsies were performed at 13, 26, and 53 weeks, after a 7 -day 5 -bromo- 2 -deoxyuridine (BrdU) -filled minipump implantation. Body weights, organ weights and {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF- 1) serum levels were measured at interim and final necropsies. Serum levels of prolactin (PRL), progesterone, estradiol, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) were measured at 53 and/or 106 weeks. In addition to the routine histopathologic examination, determination of 7 stereologic parameters after pituitary immunohistochemistry of PRL, growth hormone (GH) and BrdU was done in both sexes at 13, 26, and 53 weeks. Body and pituitary weights were proportional to the food intake. In AL-fed rats, hyperplastic and neoplastic changes developed early and progressed with age, affecting almost all animals by 106 weeks. These changes were associated with high PRL serum levels. Pituitary adenomas were {{the most common cause of}} death in both sexes. In DR rats, a delayed onset and a decreased incidence of pituitary tumors were observed in association with decreased serum IGF- 1, PRL, estradiol, and LH levels. The results of the stereological analysis demonstrated that, compared to AL-fed rats, pituitary glands from DR rats contained lower PRL and GH secreting cell volumes, and a lower epithelial cell BrdU labeling index, which correlated with...|$|E

40|$|Aim: During reperfusion {{period of}} hypoxia-ischemia, {{cyclooxygenase}} and xanthine oxidase pathways are induced. A xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol {{has been shown}} to be neuroprotective in hypoxic- ischemic encephalopathy. Caspase- 8 and caspase- 3 have a key role in neuronal apoptosis. We aimed to test repeated doses of allopurinol’s effect on caspase- 3 and caspase- 8 activities in newborn rats with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Material and Method: Seven days old newborn rats were taken and there were 10 rats in each group. After Ethical Committee was approved (TIBDAM- 25), rats were subjected to left carotid artery ligation and hypoxia (8 % oxygen and 92 % nitrogen) for two and half hours. Hypoxic ischemic rats treated with 24 mg/kg allopurinol 30 minutes and 12 hours (<b>AL</b> 48 <b>group),</b> and 30 minutes, 12 and 24 hours (<b>AL</b> 72 <b>group)</b> after hypoxic- ischemic insult. Twenty four hours after last dose, rats were decapitated. The others groups were sham and saline- treated hypoxic- ischemic (H-I) group. Caspase- 3 and caspase- 8 activities were measured in both hemispheres. Results: There was no difference in caspase- 3 and caspase- 8 activities between right and left brain hemispheres in each group (p> 0. 05). Caspase- 3 and caspase- 8 activities were significantly lower in sham group when compared to H-I <b>group,</b> <b>AL</b> 48 and <b>AL</b> 72 <b>groups</b> (all of it, p= 0. 0001). Even though there were no difference activities of caspase- 3 and caspase- 8 between H-I <b>group</b> and <b>AL</b> 48 <b>group</b> (p> 0. 05), activities of caspase- 3 and caspase- 8 in <b>AL</b> 72 <b>group</b> were significantly lower than H-I <b>group</b> and <b>AL</b> 48 <b>group</b> (respectively p= 0. 0001, p= 0. 001). Conclusions: Decreased activities of caspase- 3 and caspase- 8 in <b>AL</b> 72 <b>group</b> may suggest that totally dosage of 72 mg/kg allopurinol may be effective for reducing neuronal apoptosis in newborn rats with hypoxic- ischemic insult.
