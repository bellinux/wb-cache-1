5|$|The binding and {{inactivation}} {{steps of}} this reaction are investigated by incubating the enzyme with inhibitor and <b>assaying</b> {{the amount of}} activity remaining over time. The activity will be decreased in a time-dependent manner, usually following exponential decay. Fitting these data to a rate equation gives the rate of inactivation at this concentration of inhibitor. This is done at several different concentrations of inhibitor. If a reversible EI complex is involved the inactivation rate will be saturable and fitting this curve will give kinact and Ki.|$|E

40|$|To date, {{multiplexing}} cell-based <b>assay</b> {{is essential}} for high-throughput screening of molecular targets.

However the ore eventually turned out to be worthless iron pyrite, and it was later alleged by Robert Denham, who had assisted Kranich with his tests, that Kranich had added gold and silver coins of his own to bring the projected value of the refined ore to £50 per ton. The story that Kranich allegedly doctored the assay tests is found in a deposition to the Privy Council by Michael Lok, one of the principal proponents of the Frobisher expeditions; in the deposition Lok claims that the evidence of Kranich's fraud was presented to Lord Burghley at his house in the Strand in the presence of Lok, Sir Walter Mildmay, and all the Commissioners involved in supervising the Frobisher expeditions.|$|E
25|$|Schutz' next venture, however, was a {{financial}} disaster. In January 1577 Schutz assisted Giovanni Battista Agnello, a Venetian then living in London, in the <b>assaying</b> {{of a black}} stone which had been picked up lying loose {{on the surface of}} Hall's Island by Robert Garrard during Sir Martin Frobisher's first voyage to the Canadian Arctic in search of the Northwest Passage. Agnello's claim that the stone was gold-bearing (apparently confirmed or at least accepted by Schutz) caused government officials to authorise a second voyage by Frobisher to Baffin Island. Schutz accompanied Frobisher's ships to Meta Incognita, where he is said to have found a 'great ruby stone' which Frobisher promised to present to the Queen in Schutz's name, but which was apparently not heard of again after it came into Frobisher's hands. In August 1577 Schutz, Robert Denham and Gregory Bona, in a brick-lined furnace built for the purpose, assayed black ore mine at the Countess of Warwick's Island, (now Kodlunarn Island) in Frobisher Bay. Back in England, between 1 November 1577 and 6 March 1578 Schutz performed three 'great proofes' of the black ore brought back from this second voyage. Agnello and Kranich were also brought in to assay the ore, and Kranich and Schutz were soon at odds, with Schutz accusing Kranich, who was favoured by Frobisher, of 'evil manners and ignorance'.

40|$|The optimal {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) DNA quantitative <b>assay</b> {{for clinical}} use remains to be determined. We examined the sensitivity, linearity, and variability of a novel second-generation antibody capture solution hybridization <b>assay,</b> the Digene Hybrid Capture II <b>assay</b> (HCII), and compared it with another widely used solution hybridization <b>assay,</b> the branched-DNA (bDNA) <b>assay</b> (Quantiplex; Chiron Corp.). Our results showed similar and satisfactory <b>assay</b> linearity values, as well as interassay and intra-assay variability values, for both HCII and bDNA <b>assays</b> across different ranges of HBV DNA. Ninety-one percent of 102 serum samples from hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients showed concordant results with the two <b>assays.</b> The HCH <b>assay</b> was more sensitive than the bDNA <b>assay</b> by 1 dilution, with the lowest reading being 0. 9 pg/ml (3. 8 pg/ml by bDNA <b>assay).</b> The HBV DNA seropositivity rates for the 102 samples were 58, 67, and 97 % by bDNA, HCII, and nested PCR, respectively. While the relationship between results obtained with the bDNA <b>assay</b> and those with the HCII <b>assay</b> was nonlinear, with the bDNA <b>assay</b> yielding values 2. 83 ± 0. 92 -fold {{higher than those of}} the HCII <b>assay,</b> especially at high HBV DNA levels, a linear relationship was observed between the two sets of data after logarithmic conversion. The formula for interassay conversion of results was derived as follows: HBV DNA by HCII (picograms per milliliter) = 3. 19 x [HBV DNA by bDNA (megaequivalents per milliliter) ] 0. 866. The HCII <b>assay</b> was technically less complex and required a shorter <b>assay</b> time (4 h) than the bDNA <b>assay</b> (24 h). We conclude that the HCII <b>assay</b> compares favorably with the bDNA <b>assay</b> and offers the additional advantages of increased sensitivity and shorter <b>assay</b> time. The increased sensitivity should be particularly useful in monitoring the efficacy of antiviral therapies and detecting the emergence of drug-resistant HBV mutants. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
