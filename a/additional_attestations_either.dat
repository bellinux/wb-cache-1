5000|$|In {{the case}} that the {{employer}} is H-1B-dependent, a list of employees for whom exemption was claimed from the <b>additional</b> <b>attestations</b> (based on annual compensation or educational qualifications). This list need not be maintained if all employees are exempt.|$|R
50|$|Since H-1B-dependent status {{requires}} <b>additional</b> <b>attestations,</b> {{employers have}} incentives {{to be classified}} as non-dependent. Therefore, there is a stronger burden of proof to maintain and submit documentation in cases where an employer who prima facie appears H-1B-dependent (or borderline) files as a non-dependent.|$|R
5000|$|Where the {{employer}} is H-1B-dependent or a willful violator, {{a summary of}} the recruitment methods used and the time frames of recruitment of U.S. workers (or copies of pertinent documents showing this information). This helps provide substantiation of the <b>additional</b> <b>attestations</b> regarding recruitment and hiring that H-1B-dependent employers and willful violators need to make.|$|R

50|$|This section {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} H-1B-dependent employers, defined as employers who crossed a particular threshold {{in terms of both}} the absolute number and proportion of their workforce on H-1Bs. Both H-1B-dependent employers and employers who had been found to commit a willful misrepresentation of material fact in a recent application were required to submit <b>additional</b> <b>attestations</b> in their Labor Condition Applications. These attestations continue to be required as of 2015.|$|R
5000|$|The United States {{employer}} files a Labor Condition Application for {{the worker}} with the United States Department of Labor, making various attestations related to wages, working conditions, effect on currently employed workers, strikes and lockouts, and notice. If the employer is a H-1B-dependent employer or a willful violator and the worker is not exempt based on compensation or educational qualifications, <b>additional</b> <b>attestations</b> related to displacement of United States workers are needed.|$|R
50|$|Employers who are {{identified}} as H-1B-dependent and/or who {{have been found to}} have committed a willful violation or misrepresentation of a material fact {{in the past five years}} are required to fill Section F-1 Subsection 2 of Form 9035, providing <b>additional</b> <b>attestations,</b> as described below. Moreover, if an employer becomes H-1B-dependent after the filing of approval of the LCA, but prior to filing the H-1B petition, then the LCA needs to be refiled.|$|R
5000|$|Section 413(c) {{said that}} an {{employer}} who placed a worker with another employer was liable for any displacement of US {{workers at the}} other employer's worksite. Therefore, if required to make <b>additional</b> <b>attestations</b> due to being H-1B-dependent or having committed a past willful misrepresentation of material fact, it was the employer's responsibility {{to make sure that}} the other employer was not firing a US worker between 90 days before and after the placement.|$|R
50|$|When the H-1B1 visa (for Singapore and Chile) and E-3 visa (for Australia) {{were added}} (between 2003 and 2005), and the Labor Condition Application was {{modified}} to include them, it was updated {{to reflect that}} employees in these categories would not necessitate <b>additional</b> <b>attestations,</b> and that these employees would not count towards the number of H-1B employees. Specifically Section 1a (subsection 1) of the LCA explicitly states that the Additional Employer Labor Condition Statements are for the H-1B only.|$|R
50|$|A salvage {{excavation}} undertaken at {{the southern}} end of the village in August 2003 uncovered a tabun oven and fragments of pottery that were dated to Early Islamic period, specifically to the period of early Abbasid rule. <b>Additional</b> <b>attestation</b> to the village being inhabited during the period of Mamluk rule over Palestine, was found in the form of a wall and living space uncovered during salvage excavations undertaken in a private home in Sulam in August 2006. Other remains discovered in the village include a church, hiding complexes, and tombs.|$|R
50|$|Ordinary LCAs do {{not require}} any {{attestation}} to demonstrate good-faith effort to hire a United States. In this respect, ordinary LCAs differ from labor certification, which requires evidence of good-faith effort to recruit US workers. However, even with these <b>additional</b> <b>attestations,</b> the requirements faced by LCA are less onerous than those for labor certification. One key difference is that whereas labor certification requires waiting for several months to try to hire for the specific position, the attestations on LCAs only require one to cmeet industry-wide general hiring standards.|$|R
30|$|It is {{possible}} that mutual funds use their existing holdings to press the companies to disclose IC self-assessment reports and to have an auditor’s attestation. It {{is also possible that}} mutual funds buy into companies with IC self-assessment disclosure and an auditor’s <b>attestation.</b> <b>Either</b> way we should observe a positive association between mutual fund shareholding and the likelihood of IC self-assessment disclosure with an audit attestation. Even if mutual funds just buy into firms with voluntary IC disclosure, this pressures firms to disclose an IC report and have an auditor’s attestation.|$|R
50|$|The term H-1B-dependent {{employer}} {{is used by}} the United States Department of Labor to describe an employer who meets a particular threshold in terms of the fraction of the workforce comprising workers in H-1B status. An employer classified as H-1B-dependent needs to include <b>additional</b> <b>attestations</b> in the Labor Condition Application used for the petition of any H-1B beneficiary being offered an annual compensation of less than $60,000 and without a master's degree. The notion was introduced by the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act (ACWIA) passed in 1998 and operationalized through the United States Department of Labor's Interim Final H-1B Rule of December 20, 2000. The regulation is found in 20 CFR 655.736 in the Code of Federal Regulations.|$|R
50|$|Under the new law, which amends the Illinois Right to Privacy in the Workplace Act, Illinois {{employers}} {{are required to}} sign a sworn <b>attestation</b> <b>either</b> upon initial enrollment in E-Verify, or by 31 January 2010 if they are already enrolled in the program. The attestation form affirms that the employer has received the requisite E-Verify training materials from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security ("DHS"), and that all employees {{with access to the}} company’s E-Verify account have completed mandatory online E-Verify tutorials. It further states that the employer has posted the required legal notices regarding its enrollment in E-Verify and certain non-discrimination procedures. The employer must retain the signed original attestation and proof of its employees’ E-Verify training.|$|R
25|$|Once Special Constables have {{finished}} their foundation training, {{they take the}} Police Oath at an <b>attestation</b> ceremony <b>either</b> at New Scotland Yard or Hendon Police College. At this event, they are issued with their Warrant Card and then enjoy the full powers and privileges of a Constable throughout England and Wales and adjacent Waters.|$|R
40|$|Attestation {{has become}} a {{promising}} approach for ensuring software integrity in wireless sensor networks. However, current <b>attestation</b> <b>either</b> focuses on static system properties, e. g., code integrity, or requires hardware support such as Trusted Platform Module (TPM). However, there are attacks exploiting vulnerabilities that do not violate static system properties, and sensor platforms may not have hardware-based security support. This paper presents asoftwareattestationschemefordynamicdataintegrity based on data boundary integrity. It automatically transforms the source code and inserts data guards to track runtime program data. A data guard is unrecoverable once it is corrupted by an attacker, even if the attacker fully controls the system later. The corruption of any data guard at runtime can be remotely detected. A corruption either indicates a software attack or a bug in the software that needs immediate attention. The benefits of the proposed attestation scheme are as follows. First, it does not rely on any additional hardware support, making it suitable for lowcost sensor nodes. Second, it introduces minimal communication cost and has adjustable runtime memory overhead. Third, it works even if sensor nodes use different hardware platforms, {{as long as they}} run the same software. The prototype implementation and the experiments on TelosB motes show that the proposed technique is both effective and efficient for sensor networks. ...|$|R
50|$|H-1B-dependence {{itself does}} not trigger any {{additional}} fees. However, at various points {{in the history of}} H-1B law, additional fees have been levied on employers satisfying conditions similar to H-1B-dependency. These are employers who have more than 50 full-time employee equivalents and with the number of H-1B and L-1 nonimmigrants at present equal to more than 50% of their current number of FTE equivalents. The corresponding threshold for H-1B-dependency is 15%, but one way these thresholds differ is that the 50% threshold for the additional fees requires the employer to count people in H-1B as well as people in L-1 status. Also, unlike the case of <b>additional</b> LCA <b>attestations,</b> there is no exemption for people based on how much they are earning or their educational qualifications.|$|R
40|$|Attacks {{targeting}} {{software on}} embedded systems {{are becoming increasingly}} prevalent. Remote attestation is a mechanism that allows establishing trust in embedded devices. However, existing <b>attestation</b> schemes are <b>either</b> static and cannot detect control-flow attacks, or require instrumentation of software incurring high performance overheads. To overcome these limitations, we present LO-FAT, the first practical hardware-based approach to control-flow attestation. By leveraging existing processor hardware features and commonly-used IP blocks, our approach enables efficient control-flow attestation without requiring software instrumentation. We show that our proof-of-concept implementation based on a RISC-V SoC incurs no processor stalls and requires reasonable area overhead.

40|$|Abstract—Software-based {{attestation}} can be {{used for}} guaranteed detection of any active malware on a device. This promises a significant advance in the battle against malware, including mobile malware. However, most softwarebased <b>attestation</b> methods are <b>either</b> heuristic or unsuitable for mobile computing – and often both. One recent software-based attestation method uses so-called memory-printing to produce a software-based attestation technique with provable properties. We describe a novel memory-printing algorithm that improves on that work by being more than an order of magnitude faster, while avoiding commonly used and questionable security assumptions. This results in a truly practical and arguable secure solution – taking less than 3 seconds on a 600 MHz processor with 256 MB RAM. Our work finds applications to malware defense and trusted computing in general, and mobile malware defense in particular. Keywords-detection, handsets, malware, software I...|$|R
25|$|After {{the initial}} dynastic chaos, {{a series of}} longer reigning, better attested kings ruled for about fifty to eighty years. The strongest king of this period, Neferhotep I, ruled for eleven years and {{maintained}} effective control of Upper Egypt, Nubia, and the Delta, with the possible exceptions of Xois and Avaris. Neferhotep I was even recognized as the suzerain of the ruler of Byblos, indicating that the Thirteenth Dynasty was able to retain much {{of the power of}} the Twelfth Dynasty, at least up to his reign. At some point during the 13th dynasty, Xois and Avaris began governing themselves, the rulers of Xois being the Fourteenth Dynasty, and the Asiatic rulers of Avaris being the Hyksos of the Fifteenth Dynasty. According to Manetho, this latter revolt occurred during the reign of Neferhotep's successor, Sobekhotep IV, though there is no archaeological evidence. Sobekhotep IV was succeeded by the short reign of Sobekhotep V, who was followed by Wahibre Ibiau, then Merneferre Ai. Wahibre Ibiau ruled ten years, and Merneferre Ai ruled for twenty three years, the longest of any Thirteenth Dynasty king, but neither of these two kings left as many <b>attestations</b> as <b>either</b> Neferhotep or Sobekhotep IV. Despite this, they both seem to have held at least parts of lower Egypt. After Merneferre Ai, however, no king left his name on any object found outside the south. This begins the final portion of the thirteenth dynasty, when southern kings continue to reign over Upper Egypt, but when the unity of Egypt fully disintegrated, the Middle Kingdom gave way to the Second Intermediate Period.|$|R
