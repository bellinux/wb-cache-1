5|$|As {{a result}} of <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> shock, streams of stars can be {{pulled away from the}} cluster halo, leaving only the core part of the cluster. These tidal {{interaction}} effects create tails of stars that can extend up to several degrees of arc away from the cluster. These tails typically both precede and follow the cluster along its orbit. The tails can accumulate significant portions of the original mass of the cluster, and can form clumplike features.|$|E
5|$|Since the Victorian era the Thames {{has been}} {{extensively}} embanked, {{and many of its}} London tributaries now flow underground. The Thames is <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> river, and London is vulnerable to flooding. The threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in high water level by the slow 'tilting' of Britain (up in the north and down in the south) caused by post-glacial rebound.|$|E
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>tidal</b> forcing increases, river output {{becomes less}} than the marine input. Here, current induced {{turbulence}} causes mixing of the whole water column such that salinity varies more longitudinally rather than vertically, leading to a moderately stratified condition. Examples include the Chesapeake Bay and Narragansett Bay.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} to use remote sensing techniques {{for studying the}} continental shelf is reported. The studies reported include: (1) nearshore circulation in the vincinity of <b>a</b> natural <b>tidal</b> inlet; (2) identification of indicators of biological activity; (3) remote navigation system for tracking free drifting buoys; (4) experimental design of <b>an</b> estuaring <b>tidal</b> circulation; and (5) Skylab support work...|$|R

5|$|The {{bridge is}} owned and {{maintained}} by the Tamar Bridge and Torpoint Ferry Joint Committee, a conglomerate between Plymouth City Council and Cornwall County Council. It has a main span of three lanes, which use <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> flow arrangement to maximise traffic flow at rush hour, and two outer lanes. The north of these {{is used as a}} local access route from Saltash, while the south is used by cyclists and pedestrians, as it can no longer be used for vehicular traffic due to weight restrictions.|$|E
5|$|The {{ruins of}} Coeffin Castle {{stand on the}} summit of a rocky {{promontory}} on the coast west of Clachan. There is the outline of an oblong hall-house, which may be 13th century, and an irregularly shaped bailey, likely of a later date. <b>A</b> <b>tidal</b> fish trap, of unknown age, {{is located in the}} small bay to the south-east of the castle. To the north-east of the castle are the remains of a stone-walled fort.|$|E
5|$|The {{valley of}} Darby Creek is {{considerably}} narrower in its upper reaches, but widens out as it approaches the Delaware River. Numerous {{reaches of the}} creek have been armored with boulders or riprap. Upstream of the tributary Cobbs Creek, the stream's channel is sinuous and the creek flows through a narrow valley bordered by low, steep hills. From Cobbs Creek downstream to its mouth, the creek is in <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> flat.|$|E

2500|$|For example, if <b>a</b> target <b>tidal</b> {{volume of}} 500 mL is set but the {{ventilator}} delivers 600 mL, the next breath {{will be delivered}} with a lower inspiratory pressure to achieve <b>a</b> lower <b>tidal</b> volume. [...] Though PRVC is regarded as a hybrid mode because of its tidal-volume (VC) settings and pressure-limiting (PC) settings fundamentally PRVC is a pressure-control mode with adaptive targeting.|$|R

5|$|There {{are several}} small {{islands in the}} {{vicinity}} including Broad Shoal, Grass Holm and Skerry of Vasa. Helliar Holm is <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> islet at the eastern entrance to the main harbour at Balfour; it has a small lighthouse and a ruined broch. The String, a stretch of water that lies between Helliar Holm and the mainland, has strong tidal currents.|$|E
5|$|A {{majority}} of spiral galaxies, including our own Milky Way galaxy, have a linear, bar-shaped band of stars that extends outward {{to either side}} of the core, then merges into the spiral arm structure. In the Hubble classification scheme, these are designated by an SB, followed by a lower-case letter (a, b or c) that indicates the form of the spiral arms (in the same manner as the categorization of normal spiral galaxies). Bars are thought to be temporary structures that can occur {{as a result of a}} density wave radiating outward from the core, or else due to <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> interaction with another galaxy. Many barred spiral galaxies are active, possibly as a result of gas being channeled into the core along the arms.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>tidal</b> {{disruption}} {{event of}} this sort is when a star interacts with a supermassive black hole shredding the star, {{and in some cases}} creating a relativistic jet which produces bright emission of gamma ray radiation. The event GRB 110328A (also denoted Swift J1644+57) was initially argued to be produced by the disruption of a main sequence star by a black hole of several million times the mass of the Sun, although it has subsequently been argued that the disruption of a white dwarf by a black hole of mass about 10 thousand times the Sun may be more likely.|$|E

50|$|A half tide dock is <b>a</b> {{partially}} <b>tidal</b> dock. Typically {{the dock}} is entered at high tide. As the tide ebbs a sill or weir prevents the level dropping below a certain point, {{meaning that the}} ships in the dock remain afloat, although they still rise and fall with the tides above this. Half tide docks are particularly useful in areas with <b>a</b> large <b>tidal</b> range.|$|R
50|$|The {{terminal}} at Tidnish Cross Roads {{was located}} on Baie Verte and had <b>a</b> moderate <b>tidal</b> range and {{was protected by}} two breakwaters. However, the terminal at Fort Lawrence was located on Cumberland Basin at the discharge point of the Missaguash River on the inter-provincial boundary with New Brunswick and had <b>a</b> high <b>tidal</b> range, necessitating {{the construction of a}} lock to accommodate different water levels.|$|R
5|$|Compared to {{the related}} grey and brown {{smoothhounds}} that share its range, the leopard shark has {{smaller and more}} numerous red blood cells, allowing it to process oxygen more efficiently. This may be an adaptation for foraging in deoxygenated estuary environments. Their eyes contain very few cone cells, likely due to the murky water they inhabit. Small leopard sharks fall prey to larger sharks such as the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) and the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). On one occasion, a sevengill shark was seen ambushing a leopard shark on <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> mudflat in Humboldt Bay, striking with such momentum that the larger predator momentarily beached itself. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Phyllobothrium riseri, Lacistorhynchus dollfusi and Paraorygmatobothrium barber, {{as well as the}} copepods Echthrogaleus eoleoptratus and Achtheinus oblongatus.|$|E
5|$|Darby Creek {{flows through}} a narrow valley in its upper reaches and <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> flat in its lower reaches. The creek is in the Piedmont Uplands and Atlantic Coastal Plain physiographic provinces. Major rock {{formations}} in the watershed include the Wissahickon Formation. Three small dams historically existed on the creek, but were removed in 2012. The watershed of the creek is largely developed, with roughly {{half a million people}} inhabiting it. Most of the watershed is in Delaware County, but some parts are in Chester County, Philadelphia County, and Montgomery County. The watershed is part of the Lower Delaware drainage basin.|$|E
5|$|During the North Sea {{flood of}} 1953, Jaywick was flooded, {{resulting}} {{in the deaths of}} 35 people. Since then, sea defences have been put in place and many precautions have been made to avoid flooding. Coastal Jaywick has benefited from 30,000 cubic metres of dredged sand as part of a Â£9.4million upgrade. The residential areas are categorised as having the highest risk of flooding in the country, and a council report anticipated that global warming would increase the risk to human life in Jaywick from flooding over the next 50 to 75 years. The area {{would be the first to}} be hit by floods in the event of <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> surge over the marshes surrounding St Osyth.|$|E
25|$|The naming is {{somewhat}} confusing, because {{the speed of}} the satellite relative to the body it orbits is decreased as <b>a</b> result of <b>tidal</b> acceleration, and increased as <b>a</b> result of <b>tidal</b> deceleration.|$|R

5|$|In 1924, the Petitcodiac Tidal Power Company {{proposed}} <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> power project. This {{called for}} a dam to be built between Hopewell Cape and Fort Folly Point. The company sold shares {{to raise funds for}} the project and a series of on-site and airborne studies were conducted by the federal government, but the project fell through by 1928. As rail transport became more common, it displaced river transportation around the Great Depression. In addition, the Greater Moncton International Airport offered an airmail service from Moncton to Montreal by 29 December 1929. These factors further marginalised the Petitcodiac.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{its course}} is through low-lying {{land that is}} at or just above sea level, and regular {{flooding}} has been a long-standing problem along the waterway. Drainage schemes to alleviate it were constructed {{on both sides of}} the river. The Holderness Drainage scheme to the east was completed in 1772, with a second phase in 1805, and the Beverley and Barmston Drain to the west was completed in 1810. Since 1980, the mouth of the river has been protected by <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> barrier at the estuary, which can be closed to prevent tidal surges entering the river system and causing flooding upriver.|$|E
5|$|On August 18, the Szczecin Shipyard {{joined the}} strike, under the {{leadership}} of Marian Jurczyk. <b>A</b> <b>tidal</b> wave of strikes swept the coast, closing ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With KOR assistance and support from many intellectuals, workers occupying factories, mines and shipyards across Poland joined forces. Within days, over 200 factories and enterprises had joined the strike committee. By August 21, most of Poland was affected by the strikes, from coastal shipyards to the mines of the Upper Silesian Industrial Area (in Upper Silesia, the city of JastrzÄbie-ZdrÃ³j became center of the strikes, with a separate committee organized there, see JastrzÄbie-ZdrÃ³j 1980 strikes). More and more new unions were formed, and joined the federation.|$|E

5|$|Principal Skinner holds a Fire Prevention site at the Springfield Elementary Schoolyard. Then a skit {{featuring}} Ned and Maude Flanders goes awry. Suddenly, <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> wave bursts out, which Bart rides {{a basketball}} hoop on having flooded the gym, drenching the school yard and saving Ned. Furious at the mess Bart made, Skinner has Homer and Marge {{come to the}} school, where they learn Bart has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). Principal Skinner tells Marge and Homer that Bart must take a radical, untested new behavioral medicine called Focusyn or {{he will have to}} expel him.|$|E
5|$|The Severn bore is <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> bore seen on {{the tidal}} reaches of the River Severn in south western England. It is formed when the rising tide moves into the funnel-shaped Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary and the surging water forces its way {{upstream}} {{in a series of}} waves, as far as Gloucester and beyond. The bore behaves differently in different stretches of the river; in the lower, wider parts it is more noticeable in the deep channels as a slight roller, while the water creeps across the sand and mudflats. In the narrower, upper reaches, the river occupies the whole area between its banks and the bore advances in a series of waves that move upstream. Near Gloucester, the advancing water overcomes two weirs, and sometimes one in Tewkesbury, before finally petering out.|$|E
5|$|The chronicle {{indicates}} that EÃ³ghan had his men form-up on St Michael's Isle, an island that {{was attached to}} Mann by <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> causeway. As evening drew near, the chronicle records that an accomplice of the knight Ãvarr led a Manx assault {{on the island and}} routed the invading forces. The next day, the chronicle states that the invading forces left the shores of Mann. Ãvarr's connection to the Manx attack on the invading forces of EÃ³ghan and MagnÃºs suggests that there was still considerable opposition on Mann by adherents of Haraldr to the prospect of MagnÃºs' kingship there.|$|E
