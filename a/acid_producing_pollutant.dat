The facility captures CO2 and <b>acid</b> rain <b>producing</b> <b>pollutants,</b> separates them, and compresses the CO2 into a liquid. Plans are to inject the CO2 into depleted natural gas fields or other geological formations. Vattenfall opines that this technology is considered {{not to be a}} final solution for CO2 reduction in the atmosphere, but provides an achievable solution in the near term while more desirable alternative solutions to power generation can be made economically practical.|$|R
