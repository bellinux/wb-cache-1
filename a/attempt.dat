5|$|From 1513, Petar Kružić {{was one of}} the {{commanding}} officers of Klis Fortress. The Ottomans attempted to conquer the Klis Fortress on several occasions. The first major <b>attempt</b> was by Skender-beg Ornosović in 1515. The Ottomans captured Klis, a village just below the fortress bearing the same name, but the garrison in the fortress above held. Kružić was promoted to captain of the Klis Fortress by the ban Petar Berislavić in 1520. The second major <b>attempt</b> was in 1520, and a year later another <b>attempt</b> was made by Makut-paša, with additional 2,000 infantry, 50 horsemen and siege equipment. Another unsuccessful <b>attempt</b> was made in 1522, by Hasan-paša from Mostar and Mehmed-beg Mihalbegović. Later that year, Mihalbegović made another <b>attempt</b> at a siege with 3,000 men, but failed again. During 1523, Klis Fortress was again under attack by the Sultan's army. Attempts were also made by Gazi Husrev-beg in 1526 and 1528, and later in 1531 and 1532.|$|E

5|$|In 1992 an <b>attempt</b> {{was made}} to extract a {{mitochondrial}} DNA sequence from the skeletal remains of C.d.guildayi to compare its relationship to other Canis species. The <b>attempt</b> was unsuccessful because these remains {{had been removed from}} the LaBrea pits and tar could not be removed from the bone material. In 2014 an <b>attempt</b> to extract DNA from a Columbian mammoth from the tar pits also failed, with the study concluding that organic compounds from the asphalt permeate the bones of all ancient samples from the LaBrea pits, hindering the extraction of DNA samples.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a series of}} <b>attempts</b> at the solution of a conceptually tough problem, the Firing Squad Synchronization Problem. These <b>attempts</b> demonstrate an increasing reliance on manmachine symbiosis and decreasing reliance on powerful heuristics and preplanning. These <b>attempts</b> consist of a clerical checking program, and four <b>attempts</b> utilizing a basic backtracking program for searching the solution space. The first two <b>attempts,</b> Serial Definition of Productions and Symbolic Definition of Productions were non-interactive entirely computer directed <b>attempts</b> at solution. The second two, Functional Planning and Constraint Satisfaction were man-machine symbiotic <b>attempts</b> designed to allow the human to control and direct the computer search of the solution space. The benefits of these symbiotic <b>attempts</b> and the problems encountered with them are discussed...|$|R
50|$|During the 19th century, {{several states}} <b>attempted</b> or {{threatened}} interposition or nullification. These states {{often referred to}} the Virginia Resolution and used the language of interposition, even though they often were <b>attempting</b> or threatening nullification. None of these interposition <b>attempts</b> was legally upheld. The Supreme Court ruled against various interposition and nullification <b>attempts</b> {{in a series of}} cases, starting in 1809. The Civil War put an end to most interposition <b>attempts.</b> The most notable interposition and nullification <b>attempts</b> in the 19th century are described in the article on nullification.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} {{characteristics}} of psychotic patients with suicide <b>attempts</b> in a Chinese rural community. Method: An epidemiological investigation of psychotic patients with suicide <b>attempts</b> among 123 572 population (over 15 years of age) was conducted in Xinjin County, Chengdu. Results: The rate of suicide <b>attempts</b> {{was found to be}} 8. 17 % among all the psychotic patients (906 cases). Patients with affective psychosis showed a significantly higher rate of suicidal <b>attempts</b> (15. 3 %) than those with schizophrenia (7. 5 %) (P < 0. 005). Suicide <b>attempts</b> were significantly associated with depression and hopelessness in both schizophrenia and affective psychosis (P < 0. 001). Patients with suicide <b>attempts</b> were younger and had an earlier age of onset than those without suicide <b>attempts</b> (P < 0. 05). Patients with schizophrenia and affective disorders were the major patients with suicide <b>attempts.</b> Conclusion: The rate of suicide <b>attempts</b> in psychotic patients may be largely influenced by the illness itself. Community-based services should be necessary for these patients. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|On 31 January, an <b>attempt</b> {{was made}} to free Missouri with the {{assembled}} collection of tug boats and salvage ships. This <b>attempt</b> was ultimately unsuccessful, owing to an anchor from a previous wreck that had become embedded in Missouris hull. The extreme force generated by the tugs caused several two-inch cables made from wire rope to break, and the failed <b>attempt</b> also revealed that Missouri needed to lose more weight if the next <b>attempt</b> was to be successful. In light of this, some additional changes were made for the next <b>attempt,</b> which included cutting the anchors and chains off the battleship—after they had been re-added at Wallin's request—and the inclusion of additional pontoons to help lighten Missouri even more. A second <b>attempt</b> was tentatively scheduled for 1 February.|$|E

5|$|Abel Starkey (died September 28, 1827) was {{a convicted}} {{counterfeiter}} whose death is {{closely tied to}} Old Newgate Prison after fatally falling during an escape <b>attempt</b> {{the night before the}} close of the prison. Starkey was from Roxbury, Massachusetts and became a counterfeiter. Members of a counterfeiting ring had eluded authorities for years, but they finally discovered the secret third attic of a lightning splitter home. Starkey was arrested, tried and convicted of counterfeiting. He was sentenced to a term of twenty years in the prison, where he would amass a sum of money. His <b>attempt</b> to escape ended in his death, accounts of Starkey's <b>attempt</b> continued to be popular in reference to the prison's history.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler's {{sexuality}} {{has long}} been a matter of historical and scholarly debate. There is evidence that he had romantic encounters with a number of women during his lifetime, as well as evidence of his antipathy to homosexuality, and no evidence of homosexual encounters. His name has been linked to a number of possible female lovers, two of whom committed suicide. Another died of complications eight years after a suicide <b>attempt,</b> and one made a failed suicide <b>attempt.</b>|$|E
50|$|Historically in the Christian church, {{people who}} <b>attempted</b> suicide were excommunicated.

In the late 19th century in Great Britain, <b>attempted</b> suicide was deemed to be equivalent to <b>attempted</b> murder and could be punished by hanging. In the United States, suicide is not illegal and no country in Europe currently considers <b>attempted</b> suicide to be a crime.|$|R

40|$|Queueing {{soft handoff}} <b>attempts</b> in DS-CDMA {{cellular}} systems can cause different effects on system performance, {{compared with the}} handoff <b>attempts</b> in TDMA and FDMA systems. This is because CDMA link capacity depends on other user interference which includes the power of blocked soft handoff <b>attempts.</b> The power level of blocked soft handoff <b>attempts</b> may be large because it cannot be controlled by a target base station. In this paper, the effect of queued soft handoff <b>attempts</b> on the reverse link capacity is investigated. Using a Markovian model, system performance is evaluated when soft handoff <b>attempts</b> are queued if they are blocked. Using a queue for soft handoff <b>attempts</b> is also useful as in TDMA/FDMA systems but the larger size of a queue may cause performance degradation...|$|R

Since the 1990s, the availability of television replays and, later, ball-tracking technology to assist umpires has increased the percentage of lbws in major matches.

If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has flied out and any runners on base may <b>attempt</b> to advance only if they tag up or touch the base they were at when the play began, as or after the ball is caught. Runners may also <b>attempt</b> to advance to the next base while the pitcher {{is in the process of}} {{delivering}} the ball to home plate—a successful effort is a stolen base.|$|E
