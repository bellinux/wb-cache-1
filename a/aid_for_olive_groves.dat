40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{potential}} of very high resolution (VHR) optical and radar data <b>for</b> <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> landscape mapping. VHR data were fed into a four-step processing chain performing an object-based land-use classification. The four steps included (i) image segmentation, (ii) object feature calculation, (iii) object-based classification and (iv) land-use map evaluation. First, the optical (ADS 40) and radar (RAMSES SAR and TerraSAR-X) data were applied to the processing chain separately. As supported by two segmentation evaluation measures, the stand purity index (PI) and the potential mapping accuracy (PMA), the optical data thereby led to a significantly better segmentation and a more accurate olive cover map (Kruskal–Wallis test, P< 0 : 001). Second, synergy models were developed combining data from the different sensors {{at different stages of}} the object-based classification process, namely, (1) during the segmentation step, (2) during the feature calculation step and (3) after the object classification step. The combined use of features from the different sensors resulted in a considerable improvement in mapping accuracy, with correctly classified objects supported by high probabilities. The assessment of feature importance revealed that optical data were most important <b>for</b> successful object-based <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> mapping; however, features related to object shape and texture of the radar imagery added to its success.

40|$|Under {{the past}} Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) olive oil subsidy regime, farmers were {{eligible}} for subsidies {{on the basis of}} the amount of olive oil they produced. This led to an intensification of production, particularly on flat land, and had in most cases negative environmental effects, such as more soil erosion on sloping land and more pollution. With the decoupling of agricultural support under the newly established rules of the CAP, formalised in 2005, cross compliance measures have become obligatory. In this paper an ex-ante assessment is made of the application of cross compliance for soil erosion control (natural cover crops and terrace maintenance) in hilly and mountainous <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> in Trás-os-Montes in Portugal. A linear programming model was developed to assess the various socio-economic and environmental effects of four different development scenarios <b>for</b> <b>olive</b> <b>groves.</b> The scenarios were developed on the basis of changing market prices, wage rates and subsidies; their effects included shifts towards intensification, abandonment and organic farming. Simulations considering a minimum return to labour constraint showed very high levels of abandonment, particularly in combination with cross compliance obligations. However, even without this minimum return to labour constraint, abandonment would reach more than 20 % in three out of the four scenarios. The model showed that cross compliance obligations could be quite effective in reducing erosion, but that they would depress income in all scenarios as a result of higher abandonment and lower percentage shifts towards intensive systems...|$|R

In the landscape analysed the spatial arrangement of olive and scrubland patches showed a gradient of situations from areas with an abundance of olive area distributed in very few patches close to each other to landscapes with less olive area arranged in many patches and with larger scrubland areas. Linear mixed-effects models showed that the abundance of B. oleae is positively related to the proximity of olive patches at all studied scales.

The maintenance of a soil cover in the <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> space between lines is good, both because it favours the vehicles mobility, it promotes the rain water infiltration and, last but not the least, the soil airing. The objective of this work has been to make a socio-economic characterization of a zone of Serpa and Moura Councils in which a project of soil covers under olive trees is being developed. At the same time cultural accounts were made for the different situations under the study - irrigated <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> with spontaneous vegetation in the space between lines, irrigated <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> with seeded vegetation in the space between lines, irrigated <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> with herbicide application in the space between lines, dry <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> with spontaneous vegetation in the space between lines, dry <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> with seeded vegetation in the space between lines and dry <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> with herbicide application in the space between lines.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{reference}} evapotranspiration (ETo) {{is widely used}} to support water resource management in agriculture and for irrigation scheduling, especially under arid and semi-arid conditions. The Penman-Monteith standardized formulations, as suggested by ASCE and FAO- 56 papers, are generally applied for accurate estimations of ETo, at hourly and daily scale.

In this paper, scintillometer measurements collected for six month in 2005, on an experimental plot under “reference” conditions, were used to validate different ETo equations at hourly and daily scale. Experimental plot is located in a typical agricultural Mediterranean environment (Sicily, Italy), where <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> is the dominant crop. As proved by other researches, the comparison confirmed the best agreement between estimated and measured fluxes corresponds to FAO- 56 Penman-Monteith standardized equation, that was characterized by both the lowest average error and the minimum bias. However, the analysis also evidenced a quite good performance of Pristley-Taylor equation, that can be considered as a valid alternative to the more sophisticated Penman−Monteith method. The different ETo series, obtained by the considered simplified equations, were then used as input in the FAO- 56 water balance model, in order to evaluate, <b>for</b> <b>olive</b> <b>groves,</b> the errors on estimated actual evapotranspiration ET. To this aim soil and crop model input parameters were settled by considering previous experimental researches already used to calibrate and validate the FAO- 56 water balance model on <b>olive</b> <b>groves,</b> <b>for</b> the same study area.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of intensively managed olive plantations in arid, northwestern Argentina requires the {{efficient use of}} irrigation water. We evaluated whole tree daily transpiration and soil evaporation throughout the year {{to better understand the}} relative importance of these water use components and to calculate actual crop coefficient (Kc) values. Plots in a 7 -year-old 'Manzanilla fina' <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> with 23 % canopy cover were either moderately (MI) or highly irrigated (HI) using the FAO method where potential evapotranspiration over grass is multiplied by a given Kc and a coefficient of reduction (Kr). The Kc values employed for the MI and HI treatments were 0. 5 and 1. 1, respectively, and the Kr was 0. 46. Transpiration was estimated by measuring main trunk sap flow using the heat balance method for three trees per treatment. Soil evaporation was measured using six microlysimeters in one plot per treatment. Both parameters were evaluated for 7 - 10 consecutive days in the fall, winter, mid-spring, summer, and early fall of 2006 - 2007. Maximum soil evaporation was observed in the summer when maximum demand was combined with maximum surface wetted by the drips and evaporation from the inter-row occurred due to rainfall. Similarly, maximum daily transpiration was observed in mid-spring and summer. Transpiration of MI trees was 30 % lower than in HI trees during the summer period. However, this difference in transpiration disappeared when values were adjusted for total leaf area per tree because leaf area was 28 % less in the MI trees. Transpiration represented about 70 - 80 % of total crop evapotranspiration (ETc) except when soil evaporation increased due to rainfall events or over-irrigation occurred. We found that daily transpiration per unit leaf area had a positive linear relationship with daily potential evapotranspiration (r 2 = 0. 84) when considering both treatments together. But, a strong relationship was also observed between transpiration per unit leaf area and mean air temperature (r 2 = 0. 93). Thus, it is possible to predict optimum irrigation requirements <b>for</b> <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> if tree leaf area and temperature are known.

Naturally, a large number of parasitoid and predator species are associated to this pest, and in order to satisfy their needs they make use of ecological infrastructures occurring in the <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> agroecosystem. However, how these ecological infrastructures can be used to enhance the olive moth conservation biological control needs to be disentangled. For that, two approaches were followed. First, the influence of ecological infrastructures on P. oleae and its natural enemies was analyzed through field surveys. Then, different food resources were evaluated as potential foods for P. oleae and its natural enemies, i. e., the parasitoid Elasmus flabellatus (Fonscolombe) and the predator Chrysoperla carnea s. l. (Stephens). In the first approach, P. oleae was found to disperse throughout non-crop patches, although the implications for the pest population are unknown. The heterogeneous landscapes composed by herbaceous and woody vegetation around the <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> were exploited by syrphids as food sources. Finally, ground covers within the <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> favored the parasitoid Ageniaspis fuscicollis (Dalman) while the herbicide application diminished it. In the second approach, insects’ honeydews [Saissetia oleae (Olivier) and Euphyllura olivina (Costa) ] and the flowers of Malva sylvestris L. favored the survival and/ or reproduction of P. oleae, C. carnea and E. flabellatus. Several plant species such as Daucus carota L., Veronica persica Poir, and Lamium purpureum L. showed to be potential food resources for the studied natural enemies. From the results obtained in this research various applications <b>for</b> managing the <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> agroecosystem are propose...|$|R
50|$|The Arbosana is {{an olive}} {{cultivar}} from Spain. Typically used <b>for</b> <b>olive</b> oil production, Arbosana thrives in super-high density growing systems. In 2009, {{a study by}} UC Davis found that 16% of super-high density <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> (1,687 acres) in the state were Arbosana, and that along with Arbequina and Koroneiki, Arbosana olives {{were among the most}} common in the state.|$|R
40|$|Soil water {{repellency}} (SWR) {{has been reported}} under different soils, land uses and regions of the world, particularly in forest land and after wildfires, yet the understanding of this variable in agricultural lands is still rather limited. This study presents the characterization from field-based measurements of SWR in four contrasted <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> (Olea europaea L.) in Spain in terms of different environmental conditions and management: abandoned and commercial farms under permanent cover crop, conventional tillage and herbicide use. The main objectives were [1] to evaluate the potential occurrence, intensity and persistence of soil {{water repellency}} in different types of <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> and [2] to explore its spatio-temporal features {{as well as the}} influence of soil properties such as organic matter (OM) and soil moisture. The Water Drop Penetration Time test (WDPT) was used in situ to assess SWR values. Measurements were carried out in two areas {{for each of the four}} groves: below and between the tree canopies. A high spatial and seasonal variability was observed. SWR was absent (WDPT = 0 s) <b>for</b> the <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> under conventional tillage and with the lowest values of OM (OM-mean = 2. 04 %). The maximum WDPT values were found for cover crop under canopy in summer (WDPT-max = 610 s) and on the lanes in autumn (WDPT-max = 468 s). SWR was developed during the dry season, and to be reduced during the rainfall season as the organic compounds might be reoriented and turned amphiphilic. Strong water repellent values (> 60 s) were related with extremely high OM values (> 12 %) for the cover crop orchard.

40|$|Reference {{evapotranspiration}} (ET 0) {{is widely}} used for irrigation scheduling, to promote an efficient use of water resources for a sustainable agro-ecosystem productivity, {{as well as to}} manage water quality and to face other environmental concerns. As suggested by ASCE-EWRI and FAO, standard Penman-Monteith methods are generally applied for an accurate estimation of ET 0 from hourly to daily scale. In absence of detailed meteorological information several simplified equations, using a limited number of variables, have been proposed as alternative. In this paper, the performance of different reference evapotranspiration methods, at hourly (Penman-Monteith, Pristley-Taylor, Makkink and Turc) and daily scale (Penman-Monteith, Blaney and Criddle, Hargreaves, Pristley-Taylor, Makkink and Turc), was evaluated against scintillometer measurements collected during six month in 2005 in an experimental plot maintained under "reference" conditions (alfalfa crop). The daily values of ET 0 obtained with the examined methodologies were then used as input in the FAO- 56 agro-hydrological model, in order to evaluate, <b>for</b> an <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> in a Mediterranean environment, the impact on simulated actual evapotranspiration. The experiment was carried out in South-West Sicily, in an area where <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> are the major crop. The comparison between estimated and measured fluxes confirmed that FAO- 56 Penman-Monteith (PM) standardized equation is characterized by the lowest mean bias error (- 0. 15 mm d- 1 and 0. 06 mm d- 1 using daily or hourly data, respectively). Additionally, the analysis also highlighted that the Pristley-Taylor equation can be considered a valid alternative for an accurate estimation of ET 0 (mean bias error of 0. 35 mm d- 1 and 0. 43 mm d- 1 using daily or hourly data, respectively). The application of the FAO- 56 water balance model on the investigated <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> evidenced that the best estimations of actual evapotranspiration are obtained when the Pristley-Taylor ET 0 data are used as input, confirming that this approach can be considered a valid alternative to the standard Penman-Monteith...|$|R
