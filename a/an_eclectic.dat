5|$|Over {{the long}} term, Tchaikovsky's {{influence}} over the Belyayev composers was not as great.

The Belyayev composers also spread the nationalist musical aesthetic to Russia {{as a whole and}} were themselves an influence on composers well into the Soviet era.|$|E

5|$|Blore's {{new plan}} for the corps de logis of house was {{constrained}} by Vorontsov's wish to use the footings and foundations which had been built for Harrison's original design; this severely restricted the shape, size and layout of the palaces principal rooms.

The central bay of the southern facade was inspired by Delhi's Jummah Masjid mosque, which enabled the classical exedra of Harrison's design to be incorporated, once given an Islamic makeover, harmoniously into the design.|$|E
