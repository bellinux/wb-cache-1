The approach described in this document allows the VPN service provider to reduce the number of PE routers that have to maintain all these routes by requiring only a subset of these routers to maintain all these routes. Furthermore, when PE routers use ingress replication to carry the multicast traffic of VPN customers, the approach described in this document may, under certain circumstances, reduce bandwidth inefficiency associated with ingress replication and redistribute the replication load among PE routers.

40|$|International audienceWireless Mesh Networks (WMN) {{are growing}} {{rapidly in the}} {{research}} community due to their numerous applications and shared services. A feature {{in this kind of}} networks is the <b>any-to-any</b> <b>connectivity,</b> which opens the network for diverse kinds of attacks. These attacks generate extra traffic that possibly carries unauthorized intrusions. Our proposal, the IBW Framework, includes an approach for security in WMN detecting and mitigating the attacks through the use of non-relational databases for the data correlation and the dissemination of intrusion information among the nodes in WMN {{to reduce the amount of}} attacks in short time. Data correlation is done from the log data of servers and distributed Intrusion Detection & Prevention Systems (IDSs & IPSs) using syslog information with a particular format. Intrusion Prevention Systems can be implemented with any kind of solution, in our case we proposed iptables. Finally, a Case Study is presented, using the OLSR routing protocol and Brute Force attacks comparing our proposal with an open source blocking tool Fail 2 Ban.

40|$|MPLS) [14, 15, 1], one of {{the most}} elusive {{protocols}} of the network stack. Saying that MPLS is “elusive ” is not overemphasizing: starting from its arduous fitting within the ISO/OSI protocol stack, continuing with its entangled relationships with several other routing and forwarding protocols (IP, OSPF, MP-BGP, just to name a few), and ending with the complex technicalities involved in its configuration, MPLS defies classifications and challenges easy descriptions. On the other hand, and in a seemingly contradictory way, the configuration of VPNs with MPLS is rather simple and elegant, despite the complexity of the underlying architecture. Also, MPLS flexibility and maintenance ease make it a powerful tool, and account for its ubiquity in Internet Service Providers’ networks. The chapter is organized as follows. Section 1 gives a brief introduction and motivation behind the concept of Virtual Private Network and explains why Layer 3 MPLS VPNs are by far the most popular widespread kind of VPNs deployed today. In Section 2 we introduce the reader to basic concept and terminology about Label Switching (also known as Label Swapping) and Virtual Private Networks. Section 3 gives a high-level step-by-step description of an MPLS VPN. This is based on three main ingredients: an <b>any-to-any</b> IP <b>connectivity</b> inside the network, a signalling mechanism to announce customer IP prefixes, and an encapsulation mechanism, based on MPLS, to transport packets across the network. Section 4 explores in detail the complex interplay between IP and MPLS that is at the basis of MPLS VPNs. More technical details about dynamic routing and connecting to the Internet, advanced usage of routing, and preserving IP-specific per-hop behavior are provided in Section 5. Strengths and limitations of MPLS VPNs are discussed in Section 6. The same section proposes further readings on the subject. The reader who is interested in getting only a high-level understanding on how MPLS VPNs work ca...|$|R

40|$|International audienceCloud {{providers}} are showing an increasing {{interest in the}} TRILL protocol due to some of its capabilities such as: Virtual Machine mobility without connectivity interruption, a full non-blocking fabric, <b>any-to-any</b> <b>connectivity</b> {{without the use of}} the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) standard, fault tolerance, and dynamic scalability. Above all, TRILL is easy to manage, plug-and-play, and does not require heavy configuration tasks to cope with virtual machine migration, changes to the network size, or physical connections. However, TRILL can not interconnect two independent networks without merging them. This is why we propose MLTP (Multi-Level TRILL Protocol) which adds a two-level hierarchy to TRILL. Each level 1 TRILL campus has independent control-plane and management while the level 2 TRILL network, the backbone, is shared between new devices, Border RBridges (BRBs) and Pseudo Gateways (PGs). This way networks can be decomposed in several smaller campuses, each one of them supervised by a different entity, thus simplifying network management. Additionally, MLTP offers a greater number of nicknames while providing tenant isolation, thus providing greater scalability. Those new functionalities are provided by MLTP without degrading throughput or latency performances as shown in our experiments...|$|E
40|$|The future 5 G {{wireless}} infrastructure {{will support}} <b>any-to-any</b> <b>connectivity</b> between densely deployed smart objects {{that form the}} emerging paradigm known as the Internet of Everything (IoE). Compared to traditional wireless networks that enable communication between devices using a single technology, 5 G networks will need to support seamless connectivity between heterogeneous wireless objects and IoE networks. To tackle the complexity and versatility of future IoE networks, 5 G will need to guarantee optimal usage of both spectrum and energy resources and further support technology-agnostic connectivity between objects. One way to realize this is to combine intelligent network control with adaptive software defined air interfaces. In this paper, a flexible and compact platform is proposed for on-the-fly composition of low-power adaptive air interfaces, based on hardware/software co-processing. Compared to traditional Software Defined Radio (SDR) systems that perform computationally-intensive signal processing algorithms in software, consume significantly power and have a large form factor, the proposed platform uses modern hybrid FPGA technology combined with novel ideas such as RF Network-on-Chip (RFNoC) and partial reconfiguration. The resulting system enables composition of reconfigurable air interfaces based on hardware/software co-processing on a single chip, allowing high processing throughput, at a smaller form factor and reduced power consumption.

40|$|Extract] The access {{declaration}} process, instituted by the Telecommunications Act 1997, requires {{providers of}} declared telecommunication services to provide competitors {{with access to}} those services on fair and equitable terms and conditions. The Act vests the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) with the powers to declare a service in situations where declaration is deemed to promote the long-term interests of end-users. This paper examines the recent declaration of three local telecommunication services - local carriage service, local PSTN originating and terminating service, and unconditioned local loop service. When considering whether declaration will promote the long-term interests of end-users, s. 1 S 2 AB of the Trade Practices Act 1974 directs the Commission to consider whether declaration will: promote competition, <b>any-to-any</b> <b>connectivity</b> and 'the economically efficient use of, and economically efficient investment in, the infrastructure [...] . ' (ACCC, 1999 : 6). This paper focuses on aspects of that declaration process arguing primarily that the ACCC {{has been asked to}} apply an inappropriate set of tests. The discussion notes that parts of the declaration test are exceedingly difficult to apply and that the sequential nature of the test makes it almost impossible to investigate the sensitivity of results to changes in initial assumptions. The conclusion reached in the paper is that the current tests for declaration should be revised. The paper also notes that cost-benefit analysis can, in theory, overcome many of the problems associated with the current declaration tests. This {{is not to say that}} cost-benefit analysis is perfect. It too, suffers from its own set of problems. Nevertheless, it may be able to substantially improve current declaration tests and those involved in the up-coming review. ...|$|E
40|$|MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching) VPNs (Virtual private network) are new {{alternatives}} to private WANs (Wide area network). They are gaining popularity in industry day by day. Enterprise customers {{are moving to}} service providers that offer MPLS VPNs. The main reason for this shifting is the capability of MPLS VPN to provide built in security features and <b>any-to-any</b> <b>connectivity.</b> QoS (Quality of service) {{is the most important}} element for enterprise networks. Enterprise network have video, audio and data traffic over a single network infrastructure. In this thesis we will investigate QoS parameters (e. g. delay, jitter and packet loss) over MPLS VPNs environment. It will help the service providers and enterprise network customers to maintain QoS for voice, video and data traffic over MPLS VPNs environment. To achieve consistent end-to-end QoS, the service provider and the enterprise customer must work closely together and share the same policies to implement because service provider participates in customer routing in MPLS VPN environment. We will use the DiffServ (Differentiated services) QoS model over MPLS VPN network. We will use a six class model for service provider network and enterprise customer network to achieve end-to- end service quality. In the last part we will make tests of end-to-end traffic delay, jitter and packet loss. We will compare the results of delay, jitter and packet loss with and without the DiffServ QoS model in an MPLS VPNs environment. It will be clear in the results that without using DiffServ QoS model delay, jitter and packet loss are increasing as the traffic increases on the network. With a DiffServ enabled network, the increase of traffic over network will not affect delay, jitter and packet loss and provide constant level of service quality...|$|E
