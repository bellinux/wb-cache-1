25|$|A dimmer is {{a device}} used to vary the <b>average</b> <b>voltage</b> applied to an instrument's lamp. The {{brightness}} of a lamp {{is proportional to}} its electric current, {{which in turn is}} proportional to the applied lamp voltage. When the applied voltage is decreased, a lamp's electric current will also decrease, thus reducing the light output from the lamp (dimming it). Conversely, a higher voltage will cause higher lamp current and increased (brighter) light output. Dimmers are frequently found in large enclosures called racks or dimmer racks that draw significant three-phase power. They are often removable modules that range from 20-ampere, 2.4-kilowatt to 100-ampere units.|$|E

5000|$|In {{a circuit}} {{known as a}} chopper, the <b>average</b> <b>voltage</b> applied to the motor is varied by {{switching}} the supply voltage very rapidly. As the [...] "on" [...] to [...] "off" [...] ratio is varied to alter the average applied voltage, {{the speed of the}} motor varies. The percentage [...] "on" [...] time multiplied by the supply voltage gives the <b>average</b> <b>voltage</b> applied to the motor. Therefore, with a 100 V supply and a 25% [...] "on" [...] time, the <b>average</b> <b>voltage</b> at the motor will be 25 V. During the [...] "off" [...] time, the armature's inductance causes the current to continue through a diode called a [...] "flyback diode", in parallel with the motor.

At 100% [...] "on" [...] time, the supply and motor current are equal. The rapid switching wastes less energy than series resistors.
