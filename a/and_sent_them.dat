5|$|Unprepared for the Allied {{operation}} at Guadalcanal, the initial Japanese response included airstrikes and an attempted reinforcement. Mikawa, {{commander of the}} newly formed Japanese Eighth Fleet headquartered at Rabaul, loaded 519 naval troops on two transports <b>and</b> <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> towards Guadalcanal on August 7. However, when the Japanese learned that Allied forces at Guadalcanal were stronger than originally reported, the transports were recalled.|$|E
5|$|Benedetto Pistrucci {{was born}} in Rome on 24 May 1783, second child and son of Federico Pistrucci, Senior Judge of the High Criminal Court under the papal government, and Antonia (née Greco). His elder brother Filippo {{displayed}} artistic tendencies from a young age, but Benedetto showed mainly a disinclination to study. Federico Pistrucci wanted his sons to follow in his footsteps <b>and</b> <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> to Latin schools. Benedetto began his education in Bologna, where the family had property, but the Pistrucci family was forced to move to Rome in 1794 when Napoleon invaded Italy, and the boys {{were enrolled in the}} Roman College.|$|E
5|$|In spring 587, Philippicus {{was again}} ill, {{and unable to}} {{campaign}} in person. He assigned two thirds of his army to Heraclius the Elder and the remainder to generals Theodore and Andreas, <b>and</b> <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> to raid Persian territory. Heraclius the Elder besieged an unnamed strong fort, using his siege engines day and night until it fell. After installing a garrison in the captured fort, Theophanes the Confessor reports that Heraclius the Elder proceeded to join General Theodore at the siege of Beioudaes, but {{this seems to be}} an error. Theophanes seems to have misunderstood the relevant passage of Theophylact which has Theodore and Andreas joining at that siege.|$|E

5|$|The design {{department}} found all their locations and designed sets in eight weeks, guided by {{input from the}} filmmakers. Nowak started by creating artwork for all the major sets and locations, working with the two concept artists Tim Flattery and Jim Martin. Nowak created drafts <b>and</b> <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> to Flattery and Martin who continued to develop them until they were complete. The complete artwork was then presented to Chris Carter, Rob Bowman, Lata Ryan and Sackheim for approval. While considering the time schedule, they made no notable changes to the artwork.|$|E
5|$|These troops, {{who were}} trained soldiers, were {{responsible}} for preparing the combat reports {{to be used as}} source material for the OKW communiqués. The propaganda companies were only news-reporting units in areas of military operation, as civilian news correspondents were prohibited from entering combat zones. The troops produced the written, audio and film materials from the front <b>and</b> <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> to a processing center in Germany, where they were reviewed by censors, mostly for security purposes. The filtered materials were then forwarded to the Ministry of Propaganda for immediate dissemination.|$|E
5|$|With {{government}} abatement and Quisling's personal engagement, Jews {{were registered}} in a German initiative of January 1942. On 26 October, German forces, {{with help from}} the Norwegian police, arrested 300 registered male Jews in Norway <b>and</b> <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> to concentration camps, most in Berg and manned by Hirden, the paramilitary wing of Nasjonal Samling. Over-65s were quickly released by the Norwegian government. Most controversially, the Jews's property was confiscated by the state.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Bad Axe, Black Hawk, Wabokieshiek, {{and their}} {{followers}} traveled northeast to seek refuge with the Ojibwes. American officials offered a reward of $100 and forty horses for Black Hawk's capture. While camping near present-day Tomah, Wisconsin, Black Hawk's party {{was seen by}} a passing Ho-Chunk man, who alerted his village chief. The village council sent a delegation to Black Hawk's camp and convinced him to surrender to the Americans. On August 27, 1832, Black Hawk and Wabokieshiek surrendered at Prairie du Chien to Indian agent Joseph Street. Colonel Zachary Taylor took custody of the prisoners, <b>and</b> <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> by steamboat to Jefferson Barracks, escorted by Lieutenants Jefferson Davis and Robert Anderson.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} after the {{publication}} of Maximinus's first edict, perhaps in 307, Maximinus changed the penalty for transgressions. Instead of receiving the death penalty, Christians would now be mutilated and condemned to labor in state-owned mines. Since Egyptian mines were overstaffed, mostly due to the influx of Christian prisoners, Egyptian penitents were increasingly sent to the copper mines at Phaeno in Palestine and Cilicia in Asia Minor. At Diocaesarea (Tzippori, Israel) in the spring of 308, 97 Christian confessors were received by Firmilianus from the porphyry mines in the Thebaid. Firmilianus cut the tendons on their left feet, blinded their right eyes, <b>and</b> <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> to the mines of Palestine. On another occasion, 130 others received the same punishment. Some were sent to Phaeno, and some to Cilicia.|$|E
5|$|Between 1941 and 1942, American ornithologist Melbourne Armstrong Carriker {{collected}} 27 {{specimens of}} the Perijá tapaculo in six locations {{on the western}} side of the Serranía del Perijá. He identified them as specimens of the northern white-crowned tapaculo (S.atratus), despite size and colour differences, <b>and</b> <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> to the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. In 1953, the specimens began {{to attract the attention of}} biologists, and were successively identified as the brown-rumped tapaculo (S.latebricola), the Caracas tapaculo (S.caracae), and the Mérida tapaculo (S.meridanus). Some further believed that the specimens could belong to an undescribed species, or constitute a subspecies of the pale-bellied tapaculo (S.griseicollis) or the Mérida tapaculo based on morphological studies, but they were never classified as any of these.|$|E

5|$|Heartstrings materialized {{following}} a brief hiatus by Howling Bells, whereupon {{the band members}} worked on other projects. Additionally, Juanita became a first-time mother after giving birth. This, along with frustration from the long period of inactivity and creation inspired her and she started to write songs again, at which point she got {{the other members of}} the band involved. They made demos <b>and</b> <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> out to prospective producers, one being Alan Moulder (Nine Inch Nails, The Smashing Pumpkins). Moulder was busy at the time so he recommended that the band contact an assistant of his, Catherine J. Marks (Foals, The Killers), who after meeting, Howling Bells chose to produce the album.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to a typhus epidemic in the women's camp, Mengele cleared one block of 600 Jewish women <b>and</b> <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> to the gas chamber. The building was then cleaned and disinfected, and the occupants of a neighboring block were bathed, de-loused, and given new clothing before being moved into the clean block. The process was repeated until all the barracks were disinfected. Similar disinfections were used for later epidemics of scarlet fever and other diseases, {{but with all the}} sick prisoners being sent to the gas chambers. For his efforts, Mengele was awarded the War Merit Cross (Second Class with Swords) and was promoted in 1944 to First Physician of the Birkenau subcamp.|$|E
5|$|Kaim had six battalions of infantry, four squadrons of cavalry {{and plenty}} of {{artillery}} deployed at Rothenzholl. He posted three more battalions at Frauenalb {{to the north and}} an advance guard in Loffenau. Saint-Cyr left Duhesme's division behind to guard Freudenstadt and the Kneibis Mountain. He started from Gernsbach with 12 battalions plus six more borrowed from the Reserve. Finding that the Saxons were marching south along the Enz River to turn his right flank, he sent Taponier with six battalions and 150 hussars east to Wildbad. Taponier surprised the Saxons <b>and</b> <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> scurrying back north. With Lambert and Lecourbe's brigades, Saint-Cyr advanced through Loffenau to Rothenzholl northwest of Dobel where he confronted Kaim. Finding the Austrians in powerful defenses, Saint-Cyr tried to draw Kaim's troops out of position.|$|E

5|$|Seydlitz {{rejoined the}} King in 1758 and on 25 August, at the Battle of Zorndorf, Seydlitz's cavalry again secured the victory. He led thirty-six squadrons into {{a mass of}} Russian cavalry mingled with infantry. This charge broke the Russian right wing <b>and</b> <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> running for the woods. At the Prussian debacle at Hochkirch, on 14 October 1758, he covered the Prussian retreat with 108 squadrons, and in the {{disaster}} of Kunersdorf, on 12 August 1759, he received another severe wound in a hopeless attempt to storm a hill held by the Russians; his 8th Cuirassiers {{was one of the}} few intact regiments at the end of the battle. While recuperating in Berlin, he helped organize a defense of the city during the Austro-Russian raid (October 1760). Although he was unable to prevent the Russians from briefly occupying the city, Frederick later praised Seydlitz for his conduct.|$|E
5|$|The Council of Regency, the Royal Audiencia of Buenos Aires and the peninsulars {{opposed the}} new situation. The Royal Audiencia {{secretly}} swore {{allegiance to the}} Council of Regency a month later and sent communiqués to the other cities of the Viceroyalty, to request them to deny recognition to the new government. To {{put an end to}} these activities, the Junta assembled Cisneros and {{all the members of the}} Royal Audiencia on the pretext that their lives were in danger, <b>and</b> <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> into exile aboard the British ship Dart. Captain Mark Brigut Larrea was instructed to avoid American ports and deliver all of them directly to the Canary Islands. The Junta then appointed a new Audiencia composed entirely of criollos loyal to the revolution.|$|E

Tolkien was very {{devoted to his}} children <b>and</b> <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> illustrated letters from Father Christmas when they were young. Each year more characters were added, such as the North Polar Bear (Father Christmas's helper), the Snow Man (his gardener), Ilbereth the elf (his secretary), and various other, minor characters. The major characters would relate tales of Father Christmas's battles against goblins who rode on bats and the various pranks committed by the North Polar Bear.|$|E

5|$|When V-E Day {{arrived in}} early May 1945, Chappuis and his crewmates stayed in Asola for a week-long celebration. On {{the night the}} war ended, {{residents}} of Asola removed the seats from the town's theater for a victory ball. While two orchestras played onstage, the liberated townspeople toasted the Americans, and Chappuis danced with the Ugolinis' daughters. When Chappuis returned to the United States, he stayed {{in touch with the}} Ugolinis <b>and</b> <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> weekly food packages. Chappuis also stayed in touch with Comucci, the resistance leader who rescued him. In 1974, Chappuis returned to Italy to meet with Comucci {{for the first time in}} 20years.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{unsuccessful}} searches {{were carried out}} in Cabo Rojo by an urban militia led by Captain Carlos de Espada, and additional searches were made in San Germán. On May 23, 1824, the Mayagüez military commander prepared two vessels <b>and</b> <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> to Pedernales in response to reported sightings of Cofresí. Rivas and the military captain of Mayagüez, Cayetano Castillo y Picado, boarded a ship commanded by Sergeant Sebastián Bausá. Sailor Pedro Alacán, {{best known as the}} grandfather of Ramón Emeterio Betances and a neighbor of Cofresí, was captain of the second schooner. The expedition failed, only finding a military deserter named Manuel Fernández de Córdova. Also known as Manuel Navarro, Fernández was connected to Cofresí through Lucas Branstan (a merchant from Trieste who was involved in Bonne Sophie incident). In the meantime, the pirates fled toward southern Puerto Rico. Poorly supplied after his hasty retreat, Cofresí docked at Jobos Bay on June 2, 1824; about a dozen pirates invaded the hacienda of Francisco Antonio Ortiz, stealing his cattle. The group then broke into a second estate, owned by Jacinto Texidor, stole plantains and resupplied their ship. It is now believed that Juan José Mateu gave the pirates refuge in one of his haciendas, near Jobos Bay. The next day the news reached Guayama mayor Francisco Brenes, who quickly contacted the military and requested operations by land and sea. He was told that there were not enough weapons in the municipality for a mission of that scale. Brenes then requested supplies from Patillas, which rushed him twenty guns.|$|E
5|$|About January 1843, on {{the orders}} of the acting Settlement Engineer, Captain D.H. Stevenson, the slab was blown to pieces to clear and widen the {{passageway}} at the Singapore River mouth to make space for Fort Fullerton and the quarters of its commander. Some sources claim that the Superintendent of Public Works, George Drumgoole Coleman, {{was responsible for the}} Stone's destruction, but he was on leave and not in Singapore {{at the time of its}} blasting. Lieutenant-Colonel James Low had petitioned to have the sandstone slab spared, but had been told that it was in the way of a projected bungalow. On the explosion taking place, he crossed the river from his office and selected fragments that had letters on them. As the fragments were very bulky, he had them chiselled into small slabs by a Chinese man. He selected some of the smaller fragments bearing the most legible parts of the inscription <b>and</b> <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> to the Royal Asiatic Society's museum in Calcutta (now known as the Indian Museum) for analysis, where they arrived in about June 1848.|$|E
