These five medical schools have a six-year curriculum, in which students complete a three-year pre-clinical course, which leads to a BSc or BA, followed by a three-year clinical course, which in combination with the BSc or BA leads to a full medical degree. The degree awarded is BA at Oxford and Cambridge (which later becomes an MA), and BSc <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> At these five medical schools, it is sometimes also possible to spend extra optional year(s) where one can study for an intercalated masters or doctoral degree in addition to the BSc/BA which all students receive, for example, the University of Cambridge offers an MB PhD programme of nine years total duration comprising preclinical training, the intercalated BA (see above), clinical training and within the clinical training period a PhD. University College London offers an MB PhD programme which can be completed in just eight years of study.|$|E
500|$|Between 1 and 6 October New Jersey was {{in action}} daily at Kansong, Hamhung, Hungnam, Tanchon, and Songjin. Enemy bunkers and supply {{concentrations}} provided {{the majority of}} the targets at Kansong; <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> New Jersey fired on railroads, tunnels, bridges, an oil refinery, trains, and shore batteries. She also engaged an enemy gun emplacement with her five-inch (127mm) gun mounts, which New Jersey successfully destroyed. The Kojo area was her target 16 October as she sailed in company with , pilots from [...] spotting. The operation was well-planned and coordinated, and excellent results were obtained.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by McCartney when he was staying with new wife Linda in New York in March 1969, shortly after the Get Back {{sessions}} that ultimately resulted in Let It Be. John Lennon and McCartney were at risk of losing overall control of Northern Songs, the company that published their songs, after ATV Music bought a majority share. McCartney had been {{largely responsible for the}} group's direction and projects since the death of manager Brian Epstein in 1967, but began to realise that the group dynamic of the Beatles was coming to an end. He was particularly unhappy <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> wanting to draft in manager Allen Klein to help sort out their finances. McCartney later said that the song was written with Klein in mind, saying [...] "it's basically a song about no faith in the person". He added that the line [...] "One sweet dream, pack up the bags, get in the limousine" [...] was based on his trips in the country with Linda {{to get away from the}} tense atmosphere with the Beatles, though author Walter Everett thought the line was also a nostalgic look at the Beatles' touring years, which had ended in 1966.|$|E
50|$|Noon at {{one place}} is midnight <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> (ignoring {{daylight}} saving time and irregularly shaped time zones) and, {{with the exception of}} the tropics, <b>the</b> longest day <b>at</b> one point corresponds to <b>the</b> shortest day <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> and midwinter <b>at</b> one point coincides with midsummer <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> Sunrise and sunset do not quite oppose each other at antipodes due to refraction of sunlight.|$|R

500|$|Like Isler, Entertainment Weekly {{columnist}} Ken Tucker enjoyed Walter's transition [...] "from happy, babbling, 'I love LSD!' licorice-licking Walter to a Walter who yelled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> when escaping", {{calling it}} [...] "one of the night's great pleasures." [...] Tucker's Entertainment Weekly colleague Jeff Jensen commented {{that he was}} able to [...] "roll" [...] with some of the less plausible plot details (such as a still existing Massive Dynamic) out of praise for guest stars Cusick and Haig, believing they [...] "worked well in this world." [...] Jensen also reserved attention for Noble's scenes, calling them variously [...] "frisky and poignant", [...] "hilarious", and [...] "touching." [...] Lastly, Jensen was happy to find more details about the Observers, but wondered at the lack of the parallel universe's mention. MTV's Alex Zalben was more critical. He wondered how the episode fit into the rest of the season, and wrote [...] "It’s a curious step, and could likely drive even more viewers away from a show that can’t afford to lose them." [...] While disliking the [...] "clunky, explainy" [...] dialogue, Zalben still commented that, [...] "for a die hard FRINGE fan like myself, this episode was crack. Huge emotion, crazy science, and epic set pieces. The end of the episode had me dying to watch the next one, even if it isn’t a direct continuation. That’s good television right there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Martha appears {{alone in}} the living room, {{shouting}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> to come out from hiding. Nick joins her. The doorbell rings: it is George, {{with a bunch of}} snapdragons in his hand, calling out, [...] "Flores para los muertos" [...] (flowers for the dead), a reference to the play and movie A Streetcar Named Desire, also about a marriage and outside influences. Martha and George argue about whether the moon is up or down: George insists it is up, while Martha says she saw no moon from the bedroom. This leads to a discussion in which Martha and George insult Nick in tandem, an argument revealing that Nick was too drunk to have sex with Martha upstairs.|$|E
2500|$|The FAA {{learned that}} Eastern {{had said it}} would pay any fines from the FAA for the {{practice}} of flying in excess of regulations. The machinists, pilots, and flight attendants were all subjected to increasingly stringent absenteeism rules which would allow Eastern to fire them after fewer infractions than before. Eastern also fired increasing numbers of employees under allegations of drug abuse and phony medical claims and insubordination. A study by Virginia Tech in 1987 showed that only 2% of Eastern pilots described their jobs as [...] "very rewarding", while 85% <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> surveyed felt that way. By September 1987, Eastern's employment rolls had been reduced by 4,000 to 39,000 people. Both Eastern and the machinists' union prepared for a strike to occur.|$|E
