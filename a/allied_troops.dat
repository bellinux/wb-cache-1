5|$|Estimates of {{casualties}} vary enormously, {{but of the}} around 480,000 <b>Allied</b> <b>troops</b> involved in the campaign, 180,000 were wounded and 44,000 died, 20,000 of the dead being British.|$|E
5|$|By this time, on {{both the}} Eastern and Western Front, the {{activities}} of the SS were becoming clear to the Allies, as the concentration and extermination camps were being overrun. <b>Allied</b> <b>troops</b> were filled with disbelief and repugnance at the evidence of Nazi brutality in the camps.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the {{shortage}} of available manpower led to a greater burden being placed upon its allies (socii) {{for the provision of}} <b>allied</b> <b>troops.</b> Where accepted allies could not provide the required force types, the Romans were not averse during this period to hiring mercenaries to fight alongside the legions.|$|E

5|$|<b>Allied</b> <b>troops</b> entered Paris on 31 March 1814. Louis, however, {{was unable}} to walk, and so sent the Count of Artois to France in January 1814. Louis XVIII issued letters patent {{appointing}} Artois Lieutenant General of the Kingdom {{in the event of}} the Bourbons being restored. Napoleon I abdicated on 11 April, five days after his Senate had invited the Bourbons to re-assume the throne of France.|$|E
5|$|Cleomenes had {{fortified}} all the passes into Laconia with barricades and trenches {{before setting}} {{off with his}} army of 20,000 men to the pass at Sellasia, on the northern border of Laconia. Overlooking the pass at Sellasia were two hills, Evas and Olympus. Cleomenes positioned his brother, Eucleidas, with the <b>allied</b> <b>troops</b> and the Perioeci on Evas; he stationed himself on Olympus with 6,000 Spartan hoplites and 5,000 mercenaries.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{the largest}} naval battle in history, {{according}} to gross tonnage sunk, the Battle of Leyte Gulf, occurred when Allied forces started {{the liberation of}} the Philippines from the Japanese Empire. <b>Allied</b> <b>troops</b> defeated the Japanese in 1945. By {{the end of the}} war it is estimated that over a million Filipinos had died.|$|E

5|$|The {{operation}} did affect German {{analysis of}} <b>Allied</b> <b>troop</b> strength. In early 1944 the Allies had 38 {{divisions in the}} region, but the German battle plan identified up to 71. Whether directly related to Zeppelin or not, German forces remained in the Mediterranean throughout May 1944, and so were not available to reinforce Normandy in June.|$|R
50|$|Later in September, Union {{sailed to}} Subic Bay, Philippines, {{carrying}} heavy earth-moving equipment. She then began forward area amphibious training with the 45th Army Division {{off the island}} of Hokkaidō, Japan. During December, the ship sailed to Hong Kong and lifted <b>Allied</b> <b>troop</b> replacements to Inchon, Korea. Union returned to Sasebo, Japan, on 22 December and remained in port through 15 January 1952.|$|R
5|$|For Vendetta, {{stores were}} stockpiled in Algerian ports and <b>Allied</b> <b>troops</b> were given maps for the {{supposed}} landing zones. A naval exercise, involving sixty ships, was run between 9 and 11 June which included embarking {{thousands of men}} and vehicles from the US 91st Infantry Division. On 11 June, the Algerian borders were closed, a natural precursor to invasion.|$|E
5|$|HMS Grenade (H86) was a G-class {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy during the 1930s. She was transferred from the Mediterranean Fleet shortly after the beginning of World War II for service in home waters. The ship participated {{in the early stages}} of the Norwegian Campaign in April 1940. German Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers sank Grenade as she evacuated <b>Allied</b> <b>troops</b> during Operation Dynamo on 29 May 1940.|$|E
5|$|On 27 March 1941, an Allied fleet under Admiral Cunningham was ambushed by an Italian {{naval force}} off Cape Matapan, Greece. Three vessels of the RAN {{took part in}} the battle; HMA Ships Perth, Stuart, and Vampire. The victory at Cape Matapan allowed the {{evacuation}} of thousands of <b>Allied</b> <b>troops</b> from Crete.|$|E
5000|$|Launched in 1918 for White Star Line as Regina. Transferred to Red Star Line in 1930 and renamed Westernland. Albert Einstein {{traveled}} to the United States aboard Westernland in 1933 and remained after learning Nazis had confiscated his possessions. Transferred to Bernstein Red Star Line of Hamburg in 1935. Served as <b>Allied</b> <b>troop</b> ship in the Battle of Dakar in 1940.|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Ichiki sent forward his own patrol of 38 men, led by his {{communications}} officer, to reconnoiter <b>Allied</b> <b>troop</b> dispositions {{and establish a}} forward communications base. Around 12:00 on August 19 at Koli Point, Brush's patrol sighted and ambushed the Japanese patrol, killing all but five of its members, who escaped back to Taivu. The Marines suffered three dead and three wounded.|$|R
50|$|Prior to {{hostilities}} Japanese {{intelligence officers}} like I Fujiwara had established covert intelligence offices (or Kikans) that linked {{up with the}} Malay and Indian pro-independence organisations such as Kesatuan Melayu Muda in Malaya Indian Independence League. The Japanese gave these movements financial support {{in return for their}} members providing intelligence and later assistance in determining <b>Allied</b> <b>troop</b> movements, strengths, and dispositions prior to the invasion.|$|R
5|$|Operation Varsity (24 March 1945) was a {{successful}} airborne forces operation launched by <b>Allied</b> <b>troops</b> that took place {{toward the end of}} World War II. Involving more than 16,000 paratroopers and several thousand aircraft, it was the largest airborne operation in history to be conducted on a single day and in one location.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between the heavy infantry types began to blur, perhaps because the state was now assuming the responsibility of providing standard-issue equipment. In addition, the shortage of available manpower led to a greater burden being placed upon Rome's allies {{for the provision of}} <b>allied</b> <b>troops.</b> Eventually, the Romans were forced to begin hiring mercenaries to fight alongside the legions.|$|E
5|$|While the <b>allied</b> <b>troops</b> {{attacked}} the French right flank, Kutuzov's IV Corp {{stopped at the}} Pratzen Heights and stayed still. Just like Napoleon, Kutuzov realized the importance of Pratzen and decided to protect the position. But the young Tsar did not, so he expelled the IV Corp from the Heights. This act quickly pushed the Allied army into her grave.|$|E

50|$|This {{movement}} {{caused the}} Germans concern. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact had placed Finland within the Soviet sphere of interest, and the Germans therefore claimed neutrality in the conflict. This policy caused {{a rise in}} anti-German sentiment throughout Scandinavia, since it was commonly believed that the Germans were allied with the Soviets. Fears began to crop up in German high command that Norway and Sweden would then allow <b>Allied</b> <b>troop</b> movement to aid Finland.|$|R
5|$|Alexander had no {{experience}} in affairs of state. However, {{he was determined to}} make the best of a difficult situation and represent his father as best he could. Adopting an air of cool indifference to the government, he rarely made the effort to read official documents before he rubber-stamped them. His functions were limited, and amounted to visiting the Macedonian front to support the morale of the Greek and <b>Allied</b> <b>troops.</b> Since Venizelos's return to power, Athens was at war with the Central Powers, and Greek soldiers battled those of Bulgaria in the north.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time that the {{landings}} on Tulagi and Gavutu–Tanambogo were taking place, <b>Allied</b> <b>troops</b> were also landing on nearby Guadalcanal, with the objective of capturing an airfield under construction by Japanese forces. In contrast to the intense fighting on Tulagi and Gavutu, the landings on Guadalcanal were essentially unopposed. The landings on both Tulagi and Guadalcanal initiated the six-month-long Guadalcanal campaign and a series of combined-arms battles between Allied and Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands area.|$|E
5|$|By the 24th, <b>Allied</b> <b>troops</b> had {{established}} a line of defence {{near the town of}} Pothus to facilitate the defence of Bodø against Germany's northern advance. While his forces were engaged in battle, Brigadier Gubbins was informed that the British Government had decided to evacuate northern Norway. The withdrawal of Allied forces commenced on 29 May, with Nos. 1 and 4 Companies being embarked on two destroyers carrying other passengers, including administrative personnel and wounded.|$|E
50|$|Willem Sassen {{was sent}} to Doetinchem where he {{was active in the}} black {{propaganda}} Aktifpropaganda, Skorpion West. There he published Het Laatste Nieuws. At the beginning of 1945 Sassen was asked to participate in a Werewolf organisation in case the allied forces overran the German army in the Netherlands. He became the leader of Neurop (Neu Europa). The group was to pass on military intelligence on <b>allied</b> <b>troop</b> movements and to commit sabotage.|$|R

During the bombardment, Bouvet {{assisted}} the battleship [...] by sending firing corrections via radio while [...] provided counter-battery fire to suppress the Ottoman coastal artillery.|$|R
50|$|Minerva escorted a troop convoy from Britain to Egypt in November 1914, {{and formed}} {{part of the}} Allied naval forces {{supporting}} the Gallipoli Campaign. When the Turkish torpedo-boat Demirhisar attempted to attack <b>Allied</b> <b>troop</b> ships near Chios on 16 April 1915, Minerva, together with the destroyers Jed, Kennet and Wear, forced Demirhisar to run aground, where the Turkish torpedo boat was later destroyed. Minerva supported the landing at Cape Helles in April and at Suvla Bay in August.|$|R
5|$|HMS Diamond was a D-class {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. The ship spent the bulk of her career on the China Station. She was briefly assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1939 before she was transferred to West Africa for convoy escort duties. Diamond returned to the Mediterranean Fleet in early 1940 where she generally escorted convoys to and from Malta. The ship participated in the Battle of Cape Spartivento in November. Diamond was sunk by German aircraft on 27 April 1941 whilst evacuating <b>Allied</b> <b>troops</b> from Greece.|$|E
5|$|Having {{recovered}} from their losses at Trebia (218 BC) and Lake Trasimene (217 BC), the Romans decided to engage Hannibal at Cannae, with roughly 86,000 Roman and <b>allied</b> <b>troops.</b> They massed their heavy infantry in a deeper formation than usual, while Hannibal utilized the double-envelopment tactic. This {{was so successful}} that the Roman army was effectively destroyed as a fighting force. Following the defeat, Capua and several other Italian city-states defected from the Roman Republic to Carthage.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Pierlot began {{drawing up}} {{plans for the}} {{reorganization}} of the Belgian Army after the liberation, known as the Pierlot Plan (Plan Pierlot). The plan called {{for the formation of}} two brigades of infantry, six battalions of fusiliers, logistics and support units in Belgium immediately after liberation in order to fight alongside <b>Allied</b> <b>troops</b> during an invasion of Germany. In the longer term, these troops would form the core of a new division around which more troops could be raised.|$|E
50|$|On {{the night}} of 23-24 April 1915, known as Red Sunday (Կարմիր Կիրակի Garmir Giragi), the Ottoman {{government}} rounded up and imprisoned an estimated 250 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders of the Ottoman capital, Constantinople, and later those in other centers, who were moved to two holding centers near Ankara. This date coincided with <b>Allied</b> <b>troop</b> landings at Gallipoli after unsuccessful Allied naval attempts {{to break through the}} Dardanelles to Constantinople in February and March 1915.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 November 1914, the islands became {{the site of the}} Battle of Cocos, one of the first naval battles of World War I.
