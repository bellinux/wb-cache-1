5|$|After his death, Gaudí's works {{suffered}} {{a period of}} neglect and were largely unpopular among international critics, who regarded them as baroque and excessively imaginative. In his homeland he was equally disdained by Noucentisme, the new movement which took the place of Modernisme. In 1936, during the Spanish Civil War, Gaudí's workshop in the Sagrada Família was ransacked, and <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> his documents, plans and scale models were destroyed.|$|E

50|$|In 1992, {{he allowed}} the {{existence}} of female altar servers in the Church, a decision that was somewhat controversial because the practice had previously been banned by his curial congregation, given that having <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> male altar servers can attract <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> candidates to the priesthood.|$|R
30|$|<b>A</b> <b>greater</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> non-dominated {{solutions}} {{is obtained}} with the Combined strategy: regarding the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> solutions, we can observe in Table 3 that the search-based algorithms find <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> non-dominated solutions {{when using the}} strategy Combined. An explanation {{for this is that}} the Incremental+ strategy imposes restrictions to the algorithms and this reduces the search space, decreasing, as a consequence, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> possible solutions. GA for the system AJHotDraw is the single exception where the Incremental+ strategy found <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> solutions. The other exception involves the systems with a single solution, cases where there is no difference.|$|R
5|$|Aside from rubber collection, {{violence}} in the Free State chiefly occurred in connection with wars and rebellions. Native states, notably Msiri's Yeke Kingdom, the Zande Federation, and Swahili-speaking territory in the eastern Congo under Tippu Tip, refused to recognise colonial authority and were defeated by the Force Publique with great brutality, during the Congo Arab war. In 1895, a military mutiny broke out among the Batetela in Kasai, leading to a 4-year insurgency. The conflict was particularly brutal and caused <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> casualties.|$|E
5|$|Founded by Mitsutada in the mid-Kamakura {{period in}} Osafune, the Osafune school {{continued}} {{through to the}} end of the Muromachi period. It was for a long time the most prosperous of the Bizen schools and <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> master swordsmiths belonged to it. Nagamitsu (also called Junkei Nagamitsu), the son of Mitsutada, was the second generation, and Kagemitsu the third generation.|$|E

This type of tracery is often seen in combination with vaulting ribs of extreme projection and very rich moulding, as {{is seen in the}} chapter house at Wells, and the vault at Exeter, which stretches, uninterrupted by a central tower, for 91 metres (300ft) and is the longest medieval vault in the world.|$|E

5|$|Kronos has {{recorded}} five soundtracks including the 1998 score by Philip Glass for the 1931 silent movie Dracula, and {{has contributed to}} the soundtracks of five other movies, including Heat and 21 Grams.

5|$|The Circus Starring Britney Spears {{generated}} {{positive to}} mixed reception from critics. While some praised its aesthetics and deemed {{it as an}} entertaining show, others criticized Spears' lack of involvement during some segments. The tour was a commercial success, with a total gross of $131.8million. This made The Circus Starring Britney Spears one of the highest-grossing tours of the decade. <b>A</b> <b>great</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> tickets were sold {{within a week of}} the tour's announcement, which prompted supporters to add more dates. The tour also broke attendance records in many cities and all the North American shows were sold out. It became the fifth highest grossing tour of 2009, and the sixth highest grossing tour ever by a female artist. The show generated controversy on the Australian leg after a reporter said that <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> fans had walked out during the performances.|$|E
5|$|The area {{gradually}} declined as {{the affluent}} moved to newer streetcar suburbs, such as Cherokee Triangle, or built estates in areas east of Louisville recently connected by railroad, such as Anchorage and Glenview. Accelerated by the Great Depression, {{many of the}} large homes in Old Louisville were converted to boarding houses during the 1930s. The Ohio River flood of 1937 caused <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the remaining wealthy households to move above the flood plain.|$|E

5|$|The {{predictions}} made by Diem and Ely {{were extremely}} inaccurate. There had been heavy fighting in northern Vietnam, where the Vietminh {{were at their}} strongest, and many people {{had been forced to}} abandon their homes. Although French charities had been operating in the north, the refugee camps were disorganised and were able to provide little more than shelter. As a result, there was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> northerners who wanted to leave and start a new life in the south.|$|E
5|$|While the {{governmental}} {{system in the}} central and western part of Switzerland, as described above, is well documented, nothing of substance {{is known about the}} political and administrative system in eastern Raetia. However, records of the time show that <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> local nobles held political and religious offices in Raetia, indicating that the Romans successfully co-opted the local elite.|$|E
5|$|After the Fatimid caliphs {{moved to}} Egypt, el-Mansuriya {{remained}} {{the capital of}} the Zirids, who became the local rulers, for the next eighty-five years. The Zirid ruler el-Mansur bin Buluqqin built a palace for himself at el-Mansuriya. There is a record of the lavish marriage in 1022-23 of his grandson, the young Zirid el-Muizz bin Badis. Pavilions were built outside the city, a large array of textiles and manufactured good was displayed and music was provided by <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> instruments. El-Muizz bin Badis, who ruled Ifriqiya under the Fatimids from 1015 to 1062, rebuilt the Kairouan city wall and built two walls {{on either side of the}} road from Kairouan to el-Mansuriya. He ordered the transfer to el-Mansuriya of the crafts and commerce from Kairouan.|$|E

5|$|Being unemployed, {{we spent}} {{almost all of}} each weekday at the school, so if a tuition fee had been applicable, Mrs Mac would have earned a tidy sum of money. That, of course, was not her way of doing things. She {{required}} no payment for the training she provided, and I suspect that she was quite out of pocket over the whole affair... It would be true to say that <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the pilots whose futures were finally fulfilled in airlines in Australia owe a deal to Mrs Mac... There was no other school operating in Sydney at the time, providing Morse training to potential airline pilots, and no other school then or thereafter giving such training completely free of charge.|$|E
5|$|Each {{year on the}} Feast of Saint Jovan Vladimir, <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> devotees come to the monastery, {{popularly known}} as Shingjon among Albanians. In the morning, the reliquary is placed {{at the center of}} the church under a canopy, before being opened. After the morning liturgy has been celebrated, {{chanting}} priests carry the reliquary three times around the church, followed by the devotees, who hold lit candles. The reliquary is then placed in front of the church, to be kissed by the believers. The priests give them pieces of cotton that have been kept inside the reliquary since the previous feast. There are numerous stories about people, both Christians and Muslims, who were healed after they prayed before the saint's relics.|$|E
5|$|Edward I of England had <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> {{children}} {{with his first}} wife, Eleanor of Castile, but only one son who survived into adulthood – the future Edward II (b. 1284). After Eleanor died, the king married Margaret of France, {{with whom he had}} two children: Thomas (b. 1300) and, when the king was sixty-two, Edmund. Edmund was born at Woodstock in Oxfordshire on 5 August 1301, and was therefore referred to as Edmund of Woodstock. Son of the English king, he was also, through his mother, grandson of Philip III of France. On 7 July 1307, before Edmund had turned six, King Edward I died, leaving Edmund's half-brother Edward to succeed as King Edward II.|$|E
