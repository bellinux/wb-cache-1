The <b>active</b> <b>ageing</b> concept aims to enhance life quality and expand participation in society. <b>Active</b> <b>ageing</b> index is a tool for policymakers. The purpose of index is obtaining evidences for public policies planning for older people. The first goal of this thesis is to explore the current situation of <b>active</b> <b>ageing</b> in the Czech Republic, and the second goal is to provide information of domains which do not reach their potential and to improve situation in these domains, that would enhance the life quality of elders. An alternative methodology of <b>Active</b> <b>ageing</b> index scores interpreting {{is presented in the}} thesis to support the second goal. The author considers <b>Active</b> <b>ageing</b> index to be an adequate tool for <b>active</b> <b>ageing</b> evaluation, however it does not provide sufficient information on what actions need to be taken to improve <b>active</b> <b>ageing</b> conditions. For this reason an alternative interpretation methodology is presented. The Czech Republic <b>Active</b> <b>Ageing</b> Index value is 34. 4 point.

40|$|<b>Active</b> <b>ageing</b> is {{a policy}} tool that dominates the way the ageing society has been {{constituted}} during the last decades. The authors argue that <b>active</b> <b>ageing</b> is an attempt at unmaking the concept of old age, by engaging in the plasticity of ageing in various ways. Through a document study of the different epistemes, models and forms used in the constitution of <b>active</b> <b>ageing</b> policies, the authors show how <b>active</b> <b>ageing</b> is not one coordinated set of policy instruments, but comes in different formats. In the WHO, <b>active</b> <b>ageing</b> configures individual lifestyle in order to expand the plasticity of ageing, based on epidemiological and public health conventions.

40|$|Background: The {{concept of}} <b>active</b> <b>ageing</b> {{has been gaining}} {{prominence}} in the Nordic countries and beyond. This has been reflected in policy papers in Norway and other Nordic nations. Aims: The aim {{of this article is}} to analyse the topic of <b>active</b> <b>ageing</b> in five Norwegian White Papers (2002 to 2015) and discuss those policy documents in context of relevant research literature. Methods: A qualitative document analyses is employed focusing on how <b>active</b> <b>ageing,</b> and ageing in general, is described and which concepts are employed. No ethical approval was needed. Findings: The general theme of ageing and the specific theme of <b>active</b> <b>ageing</b> are increasingly prominent in the Norwegian White Papers studied. In all documents, some assumptions regarding <b>ageing</b> and <b>active</b> <b>ageing</b> seem implicit, such as independence being more important than (inter) dependence. ‘Productive’ activities like participation in working life are stressed, while others, like reading, watching TV or watching children playing in the street, are ignored. Conclusions: The policy documents demonstrate that the topic of <b>active</b> <b>ageing</b> is growing in importance. The documents increasingly seem to stress ‘productive’ activities – those related to working life, voluntary work or sports and physical training. They exclude activities that are meaningful for many older people, like watching their grandchildren play or reading books. Implications for practice: Practitioners in older people’s care could consider reflecting on: Government documents dealing with their own practice The prevalent concept of <b>active</b> <b>ageing</b> The trend of <b>active</b> <b>ageing</b> as a facilitating or hindering factor for good care work How present discourse on <b>active</b> <b>ageing</b> may influence their attitude towards frail older persons How they wish to relate to <b>active</b> <b>ageing</b> in their own practice...|$|R

Up to date, {{there is little or}} no evidence of studies conducted to answer whether or not determinants proposed by the <b>Active</b> <b>Ageing</b> Framework of 2002 apply to developing countries like Zambia. This article set out to (1) explore which of the determinants of <b>active</b> <b>ageing</b> apply to Africa and Zambia in particular and (2) the influence of HIV/AIDS on <b>active</b> <b>ageing</b> in general. A non-­‐experimental cross-­‐sectional research design was used to collect data for this article.

A hierarchy of Kidusan (angelic messengers and saints) conveys the prayers of the faithful to God and carries out the divine will, so when an Ethiopian Christian is in difficulty, he or she appeals to these {{as well as to}} God. In more formal and regular rituals, priests communicate on behalf of the community, and only priests may enter the inner sanctum of the usually circular or octagonal church where the tabot ("ark") dedicated to the church's patron saint is housed. On important religious holidays, the tabot is carried on the head of a priest and escorted in procession outside the church. It is the tabot, not the church, which is consecrated. At many services, most parish members remain in the outer ring, where debteras sing hymns and dance.The Eucharist is given only to those who feel pure, have fasted regularly, and have, in general, properly conducted themselves. In practice, communion is mainly limited to young children and the elderly; those who are at a sexually <b>active</b> <b>age</b> or who have sexual desires generally do not receive the Eucharist. [...] Worshippers receiving communion may enter the middle ring of the church to do so.|$|E

In {{the beginning of}} the 21 st century, the world summit on population taking place in Madrid approved <b>active</b> <b>ageing,</b> WHO (2002) as the main objective of health and social policies for old people. Few studies have been done on the scientific validity of the construct. This study aims to validate the construct of <b>active</b> <b>ageing</b> and test empirically the WHO (2002) model of <b>Active</b> <b>Ageing</b> in a sample of community-dwelling seniors. Methods. 1322 old people living in the community were interviewed using an extensive assessment protocol to measure WHO’s determinants of <b>active</b> <b>ageing</b> and performed an exploratory factor analysis followed by a confirmatory factor analyses. Results. We did not confirm the <b>active</b> <b>ageing</b> model, as most of the groups of determinants are either not independent or not significant. We got to a six-factor model (health, psychological component, cognitive performance, social relationships, biobehavioural component, and personality) explaining 54. 6 % of total variance. Conclusion. The present paper shows that there are objective as well as subjective variables contributing to <b>active</b> <b>ageing</b> and that psychological variables seem to give a very important contribute to the construct.

40|$|<b>Active</b> <b>Ageing</b> is conceptualised {{to measure}} {{the extent to which}} older people remain {{actively}} engaged with life. However, {{there is no evidence that}} the concept of <b>Active</b> <b>Ageing</b> is actually associated with the activity levels of older persons. Influences of age, ethnicity and spirituality on <b>Active</b> <b>Ageing</b> are also unexplored. Using the <b>Active</b> <b>Ageing</b> Index (AAI), this study examines whether the level of <b>Active</b> <b>Ageing</b> predicted the actual activity level of 120 Singaporeans of Chinese, Malay and Indians ethnicities, aged 55 – 64 years old or 65 years and above. Spirituality, measured by the Spirituality Index of Well-Being, was added to the AAI, to see if the predictive power of AAI improved. Hierarchical multiple regression showed that the AAI alone (controlling for age) did not significantly predict the activity level of older persons. The predictive power of the AAI improved significantly with spirituality included. Two-way between-groups Analysis of Variance revealed main effects of age and ethnicity, with higher AAI in those aged 55 – 64 and in Indian-Singaporeans. These findings suggest that the theoretical construct of <b>Active</b> <b>Ageing</b> needs further examination to identify the domains that distinguish it from chronological age, and support broadening the construct by including spirituality in <b>Active</b> <b>Ageing...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{challenges}} of population ageing and globalisation {{have been addressed}} by many welfare states in terms of <b>active</b> <b>ageing</b> policies, which in turn confront individuals with new demands such as keeping up to date with technological developments. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to analyse how individuals negotiate the demands of <b>active</b> <b>ageing.</b> The outcome variable was change in primary and secondary control strategies with regard to demands of <b>active</b> <b>ageing</b> over the course of one year. In a German sample of N = 602 men and women aged 55 – 75 years, we found a strong preference for engagement with these demands and a low preference for disengagement. Furthermore, a higher load of demands of <b>active</b> <b>ageing</b> was associated with an increase in engagement with these demands. However, when people perceived their everyday surroundings as unfavourable, their disengagement with demands of <b>active</b> <b>ageing</b> increased. Higher internal control beliefs concerning demands of <b>active</b> <b>ageing</b> were associated with an increase in engagement and a decrease in disengagement. We conclude that individuals strengthen their efforts to master demands of <b>active</b> <b>ageing</b> when they believe that they can control them. When the everyday ecology seems unfavourable, though, strategies are preferred that enable people to avoid a presumably lost case...|$|R
5000|$|The {{regional}} {{health authority}} [...] {{estimated that the}} population of the region is in between 540,000 and 673,263. Referring to World Bank Survey in 2002, Somaliland Ministry of National and Development‟s five year National Development Plan (NDP) 2012-2016, estimated Somaliland working age group between 15 and 64 years old. This constitutes 56.4% of the total population of Somaliland. Building on these facts, the working population in Awdal Region could be in between 225,600 and 246,975.6. According to Somaliland NDP, total employment among economically active Somaliland population is estimated at 38.5% for urban and 52.6 for rural and nomadic. Thus, total urban and rural and nomadic employment population of the region could be estimated at 86,856 and 133, 781 respectively which is equivalent to 21.71% and 33.4% respectively as well. Consequently, the regional unemployment rate is in between 66.6% and 78.29% respectively.Despite these figures, there is general perception that unemployment rate in the region is much higher than the aforementioned percentages. The mass emigration of youth in the region is mainly associated with the absence of employment opportunities. Most of the emigrating youth is university graduates. Parents of these emigrating youth expend their savings and/or properties with the all associated risks of emigration.There is a wide spread poverty in the region as reported by regional representative of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. This was associated, besides unemployment, with the prolonged droughts, crop failures, environmental degradation, and internal displacements. Vulnerable groups such as children, elderly people, and lactating and pregnant mothers are mostly affected.The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs aims to avert social ills such poverty, illiteracy, caring the elderly and handicaps, and protection of vulnerable groups such women and child,; and above all creation of employment opportunities for the <b>active</b> <b>age</b> groups.|$|E
