40|$|In {{the present}} work, Basrah crude oil, <b>atmospheric</b> <b>{{distillate}}</b> of 305 - 623 K boiling range, vacuum distillate of 623 - 823 K boiling range, and wide petroleum distillate of boiling range 305 - 823 K are hydrotreated in trickle bed reactor using Cobalt-Molybdenum alumina as a catalyst. Hydrotreating temperatures are 598 - 648 K, 598 - 673 K, 648 - 673 K and 648 K respectively while LHSV are 0. 7 - 2 hr - 1, 1 hr - 1, 0. 7 - 2 hr - 1 respectively. The operating pressure  and H 2 /Oil ratio for all experiments are kept constant at 3 Mpa and 300 liter/liter.     The {{results show that}} Sulphur and metal content decreased with increasing temperature and decreasing LHSV.      Vacuum residue of boiling range above 823 K is mixed with hydrotreated <b>atmospheric</b> <b>distillate,</b> vacuum distillate and with the hydrotreated wide petroleum distillate. The temperature for hydrotreating the mixed sample is 648 K and LHSV is 1 hr - 1. It was found that hydrotreating crude oil is the best choice since it gives the highest removal of sulphur, vanadium and cobalt removal. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLight {{and middle}} <b>atmospheric</b> <b>distillate</b> {{petroleum}} substances are blended to produce fuels used in transportation and heating. These substances represent the majority by volume {{of crude oil}} refined products in the United States. The goal {{of this research was}} to develop biodegradability and aquatic toxicity data for four substances; heavy, straight-run naphtha (HSRN), hydro-desulfurized kerosene (HDK), hydro-cracked gas oil (HCGO), and catalytic-cracked gas oil (CCGO). Ready biodegradability tests demonstrated rapid and extensive microbial oxidation of these test substances, indicating a lack of persistence in the aquatic environment. Differences in biodegradation patterns reflected compositional differences in the constituent hydrocarbons. Results of aquatic toxicity tests on alga, cladocera, and fish demonstrated that toxicity was greatest for catalytic-cracked gas oil, which contained a high proportion of aromatic hydrocarbons. Aromatic hydrocarbons are more soluble, and hence more bioavailable, resulting in higher toxicity. When expressed on the basis of loading rates, acute toxicity values (LL/EL 50) ranged between 0. 3 and 5. 5 mgL− 1 for all three species, while chronic no-observed-effect loading rates (NOELR) ranged between 0. 05 and 0. 64 mgL− 1. PETROTOX estimates for acute and chronic toxicity ranged from 0. 18 to 2. 3 mgL− 1 and 0. 06 to 0. 14 mgL− 1, respectively, which were generally more conservative than experimental data...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} the development of elementary analysis in the distillation profile of petroleum cuts by gas phase chromatography-atomic emission detection (GC-AED) coupling and shows the application perspectives to characterisation of middle distillates {{of a piece of}} information unheard of until now on a routine basis. The performances of the analytical assembly used have been studied for carbon, hydrogen, sulphur and nitrogen analysis. Simulated distillation, a gas phase chromatography analysis which enables determining the weight percentage of distilled matter in relation to the boiling point of petroleum cuts, has been adapted to GC-AED coupling. We have developed a method giving access to three types of information: global elementary composition, simulated distillation and elementary composition in distillation profile, i. e. by fraction (%) of the distilled product. The analysis of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>distillates</b> has been assessed in terms of precision and bias for these various types of information. The validation was carried out notably by comparison with the results obtained using reference analytical methods, on preparative distillation cuts of representative samples. The application of GC-AED to characterisation of distillates is discussed, in particular for classification purposes and for predicting petroleum properties in the distillation profile. The cetane number of gas oils was taken as an example to illustrate the latter application...|$|R
