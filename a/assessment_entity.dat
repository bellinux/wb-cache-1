40|$|Extract] This project {{aimed to}} provide new {{information}} on the biology and ecology of the blacktip reef shark to address key knowledge gaps and provide information that informs the conservation {{and management of the}} blacktip reef shark. This thesis uses a vulnerability assessment approach that has been applied in a variety of fisheries and natural resource management contexts. This approach has been taken because vulnerability assessments provide a useful framework for organising and integrating different types of information. Vulnerability frameworks have been used to assess a variety of fisheries related risks including the risks to bycatch species such as sea snakes and turtles (Griffiths et al., 2006, Milton, 2001) and sharks and rays (Stobutzki et al., 2002); the economic risks climate change poses to fisheries (Fletcher, 2005); sustainability and risks of targeted fishing for sharks and rays (Salini et al., 2007, Walker, 2005 a), and a wide range of other fisheries (see Hobday et al., 2007 for review). Australian fisheries have used vulnerability frameworks which compare a species’ susceptibility to the fishery against its productivity to describe sustainability (Gribble et al., 2005, Hobday et al., 2007, Salini et al., 2007, Stobutzki et al., 2001). Vulnerability frameworks are also used in assessing the vulnerability of species and systems to climate change (Chin et al., 2010, Füssel & Klein, 2006, Johnson & Marshall, 2007). In spite of the diversity of approaches, most vulnerability frameworks used to describe human-environment systems contain common conceptual elements (Adger, 2006) : the exposure of the <b>assessment</b> <b>entity</b> (e. g. a species) to risk factors; the sensitivity of the <b>assessment</b> <b>entity</b> to the risks identified; and the adaptive capacity of the species to cope with the risk factors (Adger, 2006). These three components (or 'dimensions') and their interactions describe the characteristics of the entity being assessed, the relationships between these characteristics and external factors, and integrate this information to estimate relative risk (Polsky et al., 2007) (see Fig 1. 1). In this project, a vulnerability framework is used to identify and contextualize information about the biology, life history and spatial ecology of the blacktip reef shark, to describe the species' exposure to pressures from fishing and habitat degradation, and to describe the consequences of these interactions for the conservation and management of the species (Fig 1. 1). Based on the previously identified knowledge gaps and the implications of these data for the conservation and management of the species, this project is has four discrete aims, each of which is designed to explore critical aspects of the blacktip reef shark's biology, ecology and conservation. Aim 1 (chapter 2) : quantify the catch of blacktip reef sharks in the GBR net fishery and describe trends in catch locations and fate of captured sharks. This will document the interactions between the blacktip reef shark and the largest shark fishery operating in the GBRWHA. This information will describe the exposure of the species to fishing pressure which is currently believed to be the most significant pressure facing sharks and rays in the GBRWHA, and provide preliminary information about the blacktip reef shark's occurrence amongst the various habitats of the GBRWHA. Aim 2 (chapter 3) : describe the population characteristics of blacktip reef sharks in the GBRWHA lagoon. The project will describe the structure of blacktip reef shark populations in the coastal and inshore regions of the GBRWHA and identify patterns in sex composition and sexual maturity of individuals in a population. The timing and location of critical life history events (e. g. mating, parturition) will also be identified, and population movements (immigration, emigration, dispersal, site fidelity) will be documents. Collectively, these data will help to determine the exposure and sensitivity of the blacktip reef shark to anthropogenic factors such as fishing and habitat degradation. Aim 3 (chapter 4) : describe the biology and life history of the blacktip reef shark. The project will provide the first description of the age and growth parameters of the species, and will also provide regionally relevant and validated life history and reproductive parameters such as reproductive periodicity, litter size and size at maturity data. These data will help to assess the species sensitivity to pressures such as fishing and habitat loss. Aim 4 (chapters 5 and 6) : describe the movement and habitat use patterns of the blacktip reef shark in the GBRWHA lagoon. The project will document the species' movement and habitat use patterns at a variety of temporal scales to identify critical habitats and movement corridors. The behavior of the blacktip reef shark will also be examined, and the coverage provided by marine park zoning will also be explored. These data will provide {{information on the}} species' exposure to anthropogenic pressures, and sensitivity and adaptive capacity to these pressures. The penultimate chapter of the thesis (chapter 7) will draw these elements together to discuss the significance of these data in advancing scientific understanding of the biology and ecology of the study species and the interactions between coastal habitats and sharks and rays, and through the vulnerability framework, provide a comprehensive account of the vulnerability of this species to fishing and habitat loss...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{case study}} of the company, Gunns Ltd, which {{proposed}} a pulp mill in the state of Tasmania, Australia, and had economic, environmental, social and political significance. The proposal was considered by various government processes and it is these processes and interactions (predominantly between the state and corporation) which the thesis analyses using critical discourse analysis. The thesis is theoretically informed by the theory of legitimation (Habermas, Turkel). The development versus conservation debate is not a new phenomenon for Tasmania and Gunns Ltd reignited this debate in 2003 when it proposed the building of a pulp mill and continued until 2007. The Gunns’ pulp mill project was not only significant because of its potential to add value to the single biggest forestry export, woodchips, for Australia (ABARE, 2007), but also for its potential contribution to the Tasmanian economy (ABS, 2012; CommSec, 2013). The mill also had probable adverse impact on the environment. The purpose of this research is to explore the role of such financial discourse in the assessment of this project and understand how such a discourse interacts with, influences and/or is influenced by other discourses in decisions that require consideration of both development and conservation. The Gunns’ pulp mill assessment process (a discursive event) was investigated {{in the context of a}} number of competing and complimentary public discourses. Critical discourse analysis (CDA) (Fairclough, 1992) has been chosen as a methodological vehicle for this study because of its capacity to analyse a complex discursive event and its key constituents/ dimensions. Three dimensions/ layers are analysed separately and then together. The outermost layer, social practice, involved consideration of socio-economic, political, historical, and legislative contexts. The innermost layer, the text, was drawn from publically available documentation from Gunns Ltd, the assessment authority, parliamentary Hansards and public submissions. The social practice and text layers were reconsidered in terms of discourse practice which exposed how discourse is produced, reproduced and influenced each layer (Fairclough, 1992). The CDA analysis was informed by the theory of legitimation using the combined insights of Turkel (1980 a, 1980 b, 1982) and Habermas (1975, 1986, 1987). The analysis revealed that a pro-development bias was legitimated by privileging financial/ economic discourse. This privileging was evident in the government assessment processes, assessment entities/statutory bodies and the legislation which supported these. It is argued that a legitimation crisis was imminent whether the project was approved or not. This crisis involved the dissolution of the <b>assessment</b> <b>entity,</b> resignation of leaders (including the premier of the state), drafting of new legislation and eventually the withdrawal of the pulp mill proposal. It was concluded that despite past experiences of the state, Gunns became complicit in the legitimation crisis. The findings in the Gunns’ pulp mill case confirmed that there were still lessons to be learned; development vs. conservation was still a contested terrain...|$|E
