At higher tempos timing becomes more of a skill, where two way communication is reduced, at higher tempos musicality (e.g. hitting the music phrasing / breaks and interpreting the music), is more difficult to achieve as both dancers have to be in tune together but also with the music. Most dancers dancing Modern Jive Blues originate from Modern JIve and are familiar with Modern Jive Beginners moves and associated absolutes.|$|R

Tachigali melinonii, a long living heliophilic tree species, is frequently observed to be extremely slender and supported by neighbours. Such observations suggest an active growth control through the perception of mechanical environment. * Mechanical environment or light availability, which one is the most influent on growth and slenderness (H/D) ? To test this question, we recorded growth of control and staked saplings of two species with contrasting habits and ecology: T. melinonii, and Dicorynia guianensis, along a natural light gradient. * Dicorynia, the more stable, responded more clearly to the staking treatment, showing slenderness increase when light is available, whereas for Tachigali, only light availability governed growth. * For Tachigali, growth allocation is mainly governed by light availability and ontogeny, whereas Dicorynia is probably similar to the average tree strategy, using the thigmomorphogenetic physiological process to control its stability...|$|R

On the present occasion, the usual amount of business was transacted, but it was done in a manner which made Crosbie feel that they did not all stand together on their usual footing. The three Commissioners were all there. The Chairman gave his directions in a solemn, pompous voice, which was by no means usual to him when he was in good humour. The Major said little or nothing; but there was a gleam of satisfied sarcasm in his eye. Things were going wrong at the Board, and he was pleased. Mr Butterwell was exceedingly civil in his demeanour, and rather more than ordinarily brisk. As soon as the regular work of the day was over, Mr Optimist shuffled about on his chair, rising from his seat, and then sitting down again. He looked through <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of papers <b>close</b> <b>to</b> his hand, peering at them over his spectacles. Then he selected one, took off his spectacles, leaned back in his chair, and began his little speech.|$|R
