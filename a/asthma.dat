5|$|Thunderstorm <b>asthma</b> is the {{triggering}} of an <b>asthma</b> {{attack by}} environmental conditions directly {{caused by a}} local thunderstorm. During a thunderstorm, pollen grains can absorb moisture and then burst into much smaller fragments with these fragments being easily dispersed by wind. While larger pollen grains are usually filtered by hairs in the nose, the smaller pollen fragments are able to pass through and enter the lungs, triggering the <b>asthma</b> attack.|$|E
5|$|<b>Asthma</b> {{is thought}} to be caused by a {{combination}} of genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens. Other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers. Diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms, response to therapy over time, and spirometry. <b>Asthma</b> is classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate.|$|E
5|$|Individuals with {{breathing}} difficulties due to <b>asthma</b> or allergies may experience additional barriers to quality sleep {{that can be}} addressed by specific variations of sleep hygiene recommendations. Difficulty with breathing can cause disruptions to sleep, reducing the ability to stay asleep and to achieve restful sleep. For individuals with allergies or <b>asthma,</b> additional considerations {{must be given to}} potential triggers in the bedroom environment. Medications that might improve ability to breathe while sleeping may also impair sleep in other ways, so there must be careful management of decongestants, <b>asthma</b> controllers, and antihistamines.|$|E
5|$|Some {{also have}} a degree of airway hyperresponsiveness to {{irritants}} {{similar to those found}} in <b>asthma.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{study of}} the {{relationship}} of literacy to <b>asthma</b> knowledge revealed that 31% of <b>asthma</b> patients with a reading level of a ten-year-old knew they needed to see the doctors even when they were not having an <b>asthma</b> attack, compared to 93% with a high school graduate reading level.|$|E
25|$|The hygiene {{hypothesis}} postulates {{that the}} cause of <b>asthma,</b> eczema, and other allergic diseases is an unusually clean environment. It is supported by epidemiologic studies for <b>asthma.</b> The hypothesis states that exposure to bacteria and other immune system modulators is important during development, and missing out on this exposure increases risk for <b>asthma</b> and allergy.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{inflammatory}} lung diseases (panbronchiolitis, <b>asthma,</b> cystic fibrosis, bronchitis). Both doxycycline and minocycline {{have shown}} effectiveness in <b>asthma</b> due to immune suppressing effects.|$|E

25|$|Sexual {{activity}} {{for the first}} time may set the stage for an associated <b>asthma</b> attack or may aggravate pre-existing <b>asthma.</b> Intense emotional stimuli during sexual intercourse can lead to autonomic imbalance with parasympathetic over reactivity, thereby causing release of mast cell mediators that can provoke postcoital <b>asthma</b> and / or rhinitis in these patients.|$|E
25|$|Exercise Induced <b>Asthma</b> (EIA)narrowing of the airways in {{the lungs}} that is {{triggered}} by strenuous exercise. It causes shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing and other symptoms during or after exercise.The preferred term for this condition is exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (brong-koh-kun-STRIK-shun). This term is more accurate because the exercise induces narrowing of airways (bronchoconstriction) but is not {{the root cause of}} <b>asthma.</b> Among people with <b>asthma,</b> exercise is likely just one of several factors that can induce breathing difficulties.For most people with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, treatment with common <b>asthma</b> medications and preventive measures enable them to exercise and remain active.|$|E
25|$|Coolio {{and jazz}} saxophonist Jarez were enlisted in July 2008 as spokespersons {{by the group}} Environmental Justice and Climate Change to educate {{students}} at {{historically black colleges and}} universities about global warming. Coolio is a spokesperson for the <b>Asthma</b> and Allergy Foundation of America. He says that he and his children are <b>asthma</b> sufferers. As a child, he was taken to the hospital several times due to <b>asthma</b> complications.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the high}} {{intrinsic}} efficacy (receptor binding ability) of epinephrine, high concentrations of the drug cause negative side effects when treating <b>asthma.</b> The value of using nebulized epinephrine in acute <b>asthma</b> is unclear.|$|E

25|$|On November 2, 2008, Donaire {{made the}} defense of his IBF {{flyweight}} title through a sixth round (1:31) technical knockout of Moruti Mthalane. During the sparring, Donaire suffered an <b>asthma</b> attack and could not carry through the twelve rounds. Donaire's <b>asthma</b> later became public knowledge after a mandatory physical examination. Although Donaire's <b>asthma</b> condition was well managed in general, after his illness in the Mthalane fight, Donaire became estranged from his father who did not acknowledge the medical problem.|$|E

25|$|Eoxins (e.g. eoxin C4, 14,15-eoxin D4, and eoxin E4) {{which have}} pro-inflammatory actions and {{contribute}} to severe <b>asthma,</b> aspirin-induced <b>asthma</b> attacks, and other allergy reactions; {{they may also be}} involved in the pathology of Hodgkins disease (see Eoxins).|$|E
25|$|ABPA {{should be}} {{suspected}} {{in patients with}} a predisposing lung disease—most commonly <b>asthma</b> or cystic fibrosis— and {{is often associated with}} chronic airway limitation (CAL). Patients generally present with symptoms of recurrent infection such as fever, but do not respond to conventional antibiotic therapy. Poorly-controlled <b>asthma</b> is a common finding, with a case series only finding 19% of ABPA patients with well-controlled <b>asthma.</b> Wheezing and hemoptysis (coughing up blood) are common features, and mucus plugging is seen in 3169% of patients.|$|E
25|$|There {{are limited}} {{national}} and international studies into the burden of ABPA, made more difficult by a non-standardized diagnostic criteria. Estimates of between 0.5–3.5% have been made for ABPA burden in <b>asthma,</b> and 1–17.7% in CF. Five national cohorts, detecting ABPA prevalence in <b>asthma</b> (based on GINA estimates), were used in a recent meta-analysis to produce {{an estimate of the}} global burden of ABPA complicating <b>asthma.</b> From 193 million <b>asthma</b> sufferers worldwide, ABPA prevalence in <b>asthma</b> is estimated between the extremes of 1.35–6.77 million sufferers, using 0.7–3.5% attrition rates. A compromise at 2.5% attrition has also been proposed, placing global burden at around 4.8 million people affected. The Eastern Mediterranean region had the lowest estimated prevalence, with a predicted case burden of 351,000; collectively, the Americas had the highest predicted burden at 1,461,000 cases. These are likely underestimates of total prevalence, given the exclusion of CF patients and children from the study, as well as diagnostic testing being limited in less developed regions.|$|E
25|$|Research has {{demonstrated}} {{increased risk of}} developing <b>asthma</b> and COPD from increased exposure to traffic-related air pollution. Additionally, air pollution {{has been associated with}} increased hospitalization and mortality from <b>asthma</b> and COPD. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes diseases such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema.|$|E
25|$|Salbutamol is {{typically}} {{used to treat}} bronchospasm (due to any cause – allergic <b>asthma</b> or exercise-induced), as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It {{is also one of}} the most common medicines used in rescue inhalers (short-term bronchodilators to alleviate <b>asthma</b> attacks).|$|E
25|$|She {{retired from}} {{competitive}} swimming, {{and with her}} Olympic fame, began to lecture around the world about <b>asthma</b> management. GlaxoSmithKline sponsored her as she spoke to over 100 groups each year across the US and internationally. Hogshead earned the title of National Spokesperson for the American Lung Association. Hogshead authored the 1990 book, <b>Asthma</b> and Exercise, the first comprehensive book {{on the topic of}} <b>asthma</b> and sports. The book tells inspirational stories of athletes who learned to manage their condition.|$|E
25|$|The {{excessive}} mucus production seen in allergic <b>asthma</b> {{patients is}} due to goblet cell metaplasia, the differentiation of airway epithelial cells into mucin producing goblet cells. These cells produce the thick mucins MUC5AC and MUC5B, which clog the airway, leading to the airflow obstruction characteristic of <b>asthma.</b>|$|E
25|$|Buteyko uses a {{measurement}} called the Control Pause (CP), {{the amount of}} time between breaths that an individual can comfortably hold breath. According to Buteyko teachers, people with <b>asthma</b> who regularly practice Buteyko breathing will notice an increase in CP and decrease in pulse rate that corresponds to decreased <b>asthma</b> symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Economic studies {{consistently}} {{show that}} the costs incurred with poorly controlled <b>asthma</b> are higher than those for a well-controlled patient with the same severity of disease. For severe <b>asthma,</b> {{it has been estimated}} that the savings produced by optimal control would be around 45% of the total medical costs.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, the Canadian Network for Respiratory Care administers two {{certifications}} for the specialization as Respiratory Therapist <b>Asthma</b> Educator, the Certified <b>Asthma</b> Educator (CAE) (preferred by practitioners with {{a pediatric}} focus) and the Certified Respiratory Educator (CRE), which comprises the CAE program with additional training in COPD.|$|E
25|$|Meta-analyses {{have found}} that {{injections}} of allergens under the skin is effective in the treatment in allergic rhinitis in children and in <b>asthma.</b> The benefits may last for years after treatment is stopped. It is generally safe and effective for allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis, allergic forms of <b>asthma,</b> and stinging insects.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} {{also supports}} {{the use of}} sublingual immunotherapy for rhinitis and <b>asthma</b> but it is less strong. For seasonal allergies the benefit is small. In this form the allergen is given under the tongue and people often prefer it to injections. Immunotherapy is not recommended as a stand-alone treatment for <b>asthma.</b>|$|E
25|$|Capsaicin-induced <b>asthma</b> {{might be}} treated with oral antihistamines or corticosteroids.|$|E
25|$|Rutten {{was born}} in Tilburg, Netherlands. At the age of 6 he {{developed}} eczema and severe <b>asthma.</b> Bas' eczema meant he always wore long sleeves, turtle necks and gloves, and his <b>asthma</b> meant {{he was unable to}} partake in exercise, and was consequently relatively skinny. He was bullied on a daily basis as a kid.|$|E
