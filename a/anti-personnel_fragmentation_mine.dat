50|$|The SAPM (Scatterable <b>Anti-Personnel</b> <b>Fragmentation</b> <b>Mine)</b> is a Chinese scatterable <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>fragmentation</b> <b>mine.</b> It is {{typically}} deployed from either 122 mm rockets or truck based mine layers. Once the mine hits the ground, two tripwires are deployed {{to a maximum}} distance of 10 meters from the mine. Tension on these wires triggers the mine.|$|E
50|$|The MMN-2 is a Georgian Claymore type {{directional}} <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>fragmentation</b> <b>mine.</b> The mine projects fragments in a forty-five degree horizontal arc to {{a casualty}} radius of forty meters.|$|E
50|$|The NO-MZ 2B is a Vietnamese <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>fragmentation</b> <b>mine.</b> The mine has {{a simple}} {{cylindrical}} metal body, with an MUV fuze screwed {{into the top}} of the mine. The main charge is surrounded by a number of steel fragments embedded in wax.|$|E

50|$|The P-40 mine is a Vietnamese <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>fragmentation</b> stake <b>mine.</b> The mines were {{produced}} using the spherical steel cases of U.S. BLU-24/B and BLU-66 submunitions {{on top of}} which is a plastic adaptor to accept an MUV style tripwire fuze.|$|R
50|$|PADMINE is an <b>anti-personnel</b> {{directional}} <b>fragmentation</b> <b>mine</b> {{produced by}} the United Kingdom, similar to the Claymore in cosmetic design with two swivelling legs, inserted into soft-ground. Its lethality out to 50 metres arrives {{in the form of}} 650 steel balls and it is activated by remote control or trip wire.|$|R
5000|$|The POMZ, POMZ-2 and POMZ-2M (ПОМЗ, ПОМЗ-2, ПОМЗ-2М) {{are three}} types of Soviet-made stake mounted <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>fragmentation</b> <b>mine.</b> The POMZ mine was used during the Second World War. It was {{superseded}} by the POMZ-2, and later by the improved POMZ-2M. These mines (and copies thereof) {{have been used in}} numerous conflicts, including the Vietnam War and the Korean War.|$|E
5000|$|The normal {{method of}} firing {{was to use}} a burning torch or slow match to ignite a saucisson (French for [...] "big sausage", a cloth or leather tube waterproofed with pitch and filled with black powder) leading to the main charge. This had {{numerous}} disadvantages; the firer was obvious to the attacking enemy, and had to race to get clear after lighting the fuse. The black powder was also very susceptible to moisture, and might not work at all. In 1573 Samuel Zimmermann devised an improved method which incorporated a snaphance (or later, flintlock mechanism) into the charge and connected its trigger to the surface with a wire. This was more resistant to moisture, better concealed, and enabled the firer to be further away. It also enabled the fougasse to be tripwire activated, turning it into an <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>fragmentation</b> <b>mine.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Cardoen EC-2 mine is a Chilean {{directional}} <b>fragmentation</b> <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>mine.</b> It is broadly {{similar to}} the U.S. M18 Claymore mine.|$|R
50|$|The MBV-78-A2 {{is a small}} {{cylindrical}} Vietnamese <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>fragmentation</b> stake <b>mine.</b> It is {{unrelated to}} the MBV-78-A1. The mine has a large plastic head which contains the main charge wrapped around the detonator. A fragmentation layer of steel pieces set into wax surrounds the main charge. The plastic head has two mounting lugs for stake mounting the mine. A Vietnamese copy of the Russian MUV fuze is typically used with the mine, although other fuzes could be used.|$|R
50|$|The Mini MineWolf MW240 is a light, {{remote-controlled}} de-mining machine {{which is}} easily transported to remote areas. It {{is designed to}} operate in challenging environments and withstand blasts from Anti-Tank, <b>Anti-Personnel</b> and <b>fragmentation</b> <b>mines.</b> It offers a choice of tiller or flail operations depending on conditions with continuous ground penetration up {{to a depth of}} 25 cm, with automatic depth control. It has an average clearance performance 5,000m² - 12,000m² per day.|$|R
50|$|The M18 {{directional}} <b>fragmentation</b> <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>mine,</b> {{developed by}} Cardoen of Chile, contains 626 grams of explosives, surrounded by 607 AP fragmentation units providing a 60 degree arc of fire, with a 50-250 metre lethal range.|$|R
50|$|The M61 or Model 61 and M63 or Model 63 are French <b>anti-personnel</b> stake <b>fragmentation</b> stake <b>mines</b> {{the mines}} are {{sometimes}} called piquet (picket). The M61 is {{slightly larger than}} the M63, but otherwise the mines are similar in appearance and operation. The mines have plastic cases, and use the ALPR ID 59 fuze, which is also used in the MI AP DV 59 mine, {{it can also be}} fitted with a tripwire fuze. The mines can be fitted with a plastic detonator making the mine very difficult to detect.|$|R

50|$|The Soviet F1 hand grenade, is an <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>fragmentation</b> {{defensive}} grenade. It {{is based}} on the French F1 grenade and contains a 60-gram explosive charge (TNT). The total weight of the grenade with the fuze is about 600 grams.|$|R
5000|$|The RGD-5 (Ruchnaya Granata Distantsionnaya) English [...] "Hand Grenade Remote", is a post-World War II Soviet <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>fragmentation</b> grenade, {{designed}} in the early 1950s. RGD-5 was accepted to service in 1954. It is still in service with many of Russia's former client states and has been supplied to Iraq {{as well as other}} Arab nations.|$|R
50|$|The Splitterring (German {{compound}} combining Splitter (splinter or fragment) and Ring (ring)) was a fragmentation sleeve for the M24 and M43 stick grenades, {{developed by}} the Heer in 1942. German stick grenades had only a thin steel casing surrounding the explosive charge, which relied principally on blast for effect; {{the addition of a}} Splitterring gave it greatly increased <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>fragmentation</b> ability.|$|R

500|$|Although Little Boy {{exploded}} {{with the}} energy equivalent of 16,000 tons of TNT, the Strategic Bombing Survey estimated that the same blast and fire effect could {{have been caused by}} 2,100 tons of conventional bombs: [...] "220 B-29s carrying 1,200 tons of incendiary bombs, 400 tons of high-explosive bombs, and 500 tons of <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>fragmentation</b> bombs." [...] Since the target was spread across a two-dimensional plane, the vertical component of a single spherical nuclear explosion was largely wasted. A cluster bomb pattern of smaller explosions would have been a more energy-efficient match to the target.|$|R
50|$|Concussion grenades {{are best}} used in {{enclosed}} spaces such as buildings or bunkers, which contain the blast for maximum effect; <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>fragmentation</b> grenades {{are designed to}} be effective against personnel in the open. The Splitterring was a simple cylindrical steel sleeve, with either a smooth or serrated surface, clipped in place over the head of a stick grenade with three keepers around the base, and secured with a tension ring. This easy modification allowed a single type of grenade to be manufactured and carried by soldiers, whereas other nations often produced separate types of concussion and anti-personnel grenades.|$|R
50|$|The 4AHM-100, AHM-200, AHM-200-1, AHM-200-2, PMN-150, and PMN-250 are Bulgarian {{directional}} <b>fragmentation</b> <b>mines</b> {{that can}} be used with proximity fuzes to function as anti-helicopter mines.|$|R
50|$|The {{weaponry}} of the Heavy Gear {{is usually}} lighter and less powerful than a main battle tank, as Gears themselves typically weigh only a fifth (or less) {{the weight of}} a tank. They typically have one automatic cannon carried as a Gear sized hand held assault rifle. They also typically have a shoulder mounted multiple-launch missile launcher rack, as well as a small <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>fragmentation</b> grenade launcher for use against infantry. However, variants of many machines, especially heavier models, can carry or mount a wide variety of weapons, such as heavy mortars, bazookas, guided missiles, larger hand-held grenade launchers, field guns or cannons, and even advanced directed energy weapons.|$|R
