5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E

500|$|Mary Alice {{appears in}} flashbacks and dream {{sequences}} in {{the remainder of}} the series, during which several previously unknown details <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> she committed suicide are revealed. In season two, Mary Alice {{was the first of the}} housewives to move onto Wisteria Lane, to which she recounts how she met each of them and how they all became friends. In season three, Lynette has a recurring nightmare of the last time she spoke to Mary Alice; while she was reading her blackmail note for the first time on her front lawn, the day she committed suicide. Lynette asks if she is okay, to which Mary Alice says she is and while Lynette knew otherwise, she had groceries that needed refrigeration, so she simply told Mary Alice she would see her later. After a hostage situation at the local grocery store, Lynette has one final dream in which she speaks to Mary Alice and asks how she can help her; she tells her that we can’t prevent what we can’t predict, and to enjoy the beautiful day, as we get so few of them. Afterward, Mary Alice states that this was the last time Lynette would ever dream of her, and for her sake, she is grateful. In season four, Mary Alice appears in two separate flashbacks to when Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany) was first living on Wisteria Lane; in [...] "Now You Know", she and Susan knock on Katherine’s door wondering why there is a moving truck outside her house, to which a rattled Katherine says she got a new job in Chicago.

2500|$|At a {{listening}} {{session in}} New York City, J. Cole previewed the album to a select few, including Insanul Ahmed of Complex. At the listening session {{it was revealed}} the song [...] "In the Morning" [...] featuring Drake off his Friday Night Lights mixtape would appear on the album. Cole defended this decision saying, he felt the song never got the push it deserved, and {{he wanted it to}} reach more people. Another song that was previously released on another project The Warm Up, was [...] "Lights Please". Cole explained this song was the track that won over his manager Mark Pitt and Jay-Z. The interlude, was revealed to be a quick skit where Cole talks <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> he found out Jay-Z wanted to sign him. As soon as Cole got the good news he was pulled over and ended up spending the night in jail for parking violations. Even so, he explains that it was [...] "the easiest time ever" [...] because he knew success was coming around the corner. The track [...] "Rise and Shine" [...] opens with a sample from the documentary, Backstage where Jay-Z is talking about finding that one great artist that he'll sign. [...] "Dollar and a Dream III" [...] was revealed, produced by Kyle Justice, the third in the [...] "Dollar and a Dream series" [...] following the two from his first two mixtapes. In an interview with VIBE Cole admitted that he originally wanted Jay-Z to appear on the song [...] "God's Gift" [...] rather than [...] "Mr. Nice Watch." [...] He continued saying, [...] "Everything worked out, I'm a true believer that everything happens for a reason. Like, when he did that, it made way more sense than my song. It's a bigger record, a more universal record. Being the hip-hop nerd that I am, I would have loved to hear Jay-Z on that [...] beat. But really, I'm fine on that song alone." [...] J. Cole released [...] "Mr. Nice Watch" [...] himself through the internet, for promotional purposes, on September 14, 2011. The song contains elements of Dubstep and Electronica. Two days before the album's release, J. Cole released a music video for the bonus track, [...] "Daddy's Little Girl". [...] On October 25, J.
