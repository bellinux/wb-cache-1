In 1904, numerous newspaper articles and editorials were written, mostly in Chicago, about the Society. Those articles were often sensationalist and served to put the Society in a bad light. The views <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> <b>of</b> the Society, particularly those against marriage and promoting free love, were not well accepted in the small Ohio community. Thus, in 1904, the group left Lisbon for Chicago where they expected their progressive ideas might be better tolerated.|$|E

5|$|More broadly, the Restoration Movement was an evangelistic and Bible-based effort {{launched}} in various places as several people sought {{a return to}} the original teachings <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> <b>of</b> the New Testament.

5|$|The belief <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> <b>of</b> the Hanzhong Celestial Masters had a {{profound}} legacy upon future Daoist belief. The movement marked a significant change from earlier, philosophical Daoist movements. No longer was Daoism a philosophical pastime for the literate and wealthy; it was now promoted to all classes of society, including the illiterate and the non-Chinese. In addition, the Celestial Masters were the first Daoist group to form an organized priesthood that helped spread their beliefs. Being the first organized religious Daoists, the first Celestial Masters are the ancestors of all subsequent Daoist movements such as the Shangqing and Lingbao movements, {{as well as the}} medieval Zhengyi Daoists, who claimed affinity to the first Celestial Masters.|$|E
5|$|In Epiphanius' polemic {{against the}} Ebionites found in Panarion 30, a complex picture emerges of the beliefs <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> <b>of</b> the 4th century Ebionites that cannot easily be {{separated}} from his method of combining together disparate sources. While scholars such as Hans-Joachim Schoeps literally interpreted Epiphanius' account as describing a later syncretic development of Ebionism, more recent scholarship has {{found it difficult to}} reconcile his report with those of the earlier Church Fathers, leading to a conjecture by scholar Petri Luomanen that a second group of Hellenistic-Samaritan Ebionites may also have been present. The rejection of the Jewish sacrifices and the implication of an end-time prophet Christology {{due to the lack of}} a birth narrative lend support for the association of the Gospel of the Ebionites with a group or groups different from the Ebionites known to Irenaeus.|$|E

5|$|Scholarship in {{the area}} of Jewish Christian studies has tended to be based on {{artificial}} constructs similar to those developed by the early Christian heresiologists, with the underlying assumption that all of the beliefs <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> <b>of</b> these groups were based on theology. This has led to the perpetuation of ideological definitions that fail {{to take into account the}} pluriformity of these groups, reflecting differences in geography, time periods in history, and ethnicity. With respect to Epiphanius, and the Ebionites in particular, insufficient attention has been paid to the highly speculative nature of his theological constructs and his mixing together of disparate sources, including his use of a gospel harmony that may have had nothing to do with the Ebionite sect known to Irenaeus. In the end, he presents an enigmatic picture of the Ebionites and their place in early Christian history.|$|E
5|$|The Olympic Games {{have been}} criticised as {{upholding}} (and {{in some cases}} increasing) the colonial policies <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> <b>of</b> some host nations and cities either {{in the name of}} the Olympics by associated parties or directly by official Olympic bodies, such as the International Olympic Committee, host organising committees and official sponsors. Critics have argued that the Olympics have engaged in or caused erroneous anthropological and colonial knowledge production, erasure, commodification and appropriation of indigenous ceremonies and symbolism, theft and inappropriate display of indigenous objects, further encroachment on and support of the theft of indigenous lands, and neglect and/or intensification of poor social conditions for indigenous peoples. Such practices have been observed at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri; the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec; the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta; and the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|The Vedic beliefs <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> <b>of</b> the pre-classical era {{were closely}} related to the {{hypothesised}} Proto-Indo-European religion, and the pre-Islamic Indo-Iranian religion. The earliest iconic artworks of Shiva may be from Gandhara and northwest parts of ancient India. There is some uncertainty as the artwork that has survived is damaged and they show some overlap with meditative Buddha-related artwork, but the presence of Shiva's trident and phallic symbolism in this art suggests it was likely Shiva. Numismatics research suggests that numerous coins of the ancient Kushan Empire that have survived, were images of a god who is probably Shiva. The Shiva in Kushan coins is referred to as Oesho of unclear etymology and origins, but the simultaneous presence of Indra and Shiva in the Kushan era artwork suggest that they were revered deities by the start of the Kushan Empire.|$|E

5|$|While {{teaching}} at the Budich Institute, Maeser came across Die Mormonen, an anti-Mormon book, by Moritz Busch. He and Edward Schoenfield, Maeser's brother-in-law and fellow teacher, decided to investigate the beliefs <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> <b>of</b> the LDS Church. Maeser wrote letters to missionaries of the church; missionary William Budge volunteered to go to Maeser's home to teach him and answer his questions. Both Maeser and Schoenfield joined the LDS Church. Maeser was baptized by Franklin D. Richards and Budge on October 14, 1855, in the Elbe River. Maeser was baptized at night because the church was banned in Germany at that time. Maeser was the first Mormon baptized in Saxony. His wife, Anna, was baptized shortly after on October 19. The following Sunday, a new branch of the church was established in Dresden, and Maeser became the first president. He {{and his family were}} forced to leave Germany by the Dresden police in July 1856, and would eventually travel to Salt Lake City, where Latter-day Saints were gathering.|$|E
5|$|While {{the book}} was {{readable}} enough to sell, its dryness ensured that it was seen as aimed at specialist scientists {{and could not be}} dismissed as mere journalism or imaginative fiction. Unlike the still-popular Vestiges, it avoided the narrative style of the historical novel and cosmological speculation, though the closing sentence clearly hinted at cosmic progression. Darwin had long been immersed in the literary forms <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> <b>of</b> specialist science, and made effective use of his skills in structuring arguments. David Quammen has described the book as written in everyday language for a wide audience, but noted that Darwin's literary style was uneven: in some places he used convoluted sentences that are difficult to read, while in other places his writing was beautiful. Quammen advised that later editions were weakened by Darwin making concessions and adding details to address his critics, and recommended the first edition. James T. Costa said that because {{the book was}} an abstract produced in haste in response to Wallace's essay, it was more approachable than the big book on natural selection Darwin had been working on, which would have been encumbered by scholarly footnotes and much more technical detail. He added that some parts of Origin are dense, but other parts are almost lyrical, and the case studies and observations are presented in a narrative style unusual in serious scientific books, which broadened its audience.|$|E

40|$|Background: A {{significant}} {{growth has}} been associated with the awareness and acceptability of physiotherapy and therapeutic exercise techniques in the past few decades, yet so little is reported in the literature about the Knowledge, Attitude <b>and</b> <b>Practice</b> <b>of</b> Exercise Prescription among Physiotherapists. This study was therefore aimed at assessing the Knowledge, Attitude <b>and</b> <b>Practice</b> <b>of</b> the Principles of Exercise Prescription among Physiotherapists in Nigeria. Methods: A total <b>of</b> 300 <b>practicing</b> physiotherapists completed a 31 -item questionnaire data on socio-demographics, knowledge, attitude <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> the principles of exercise prescription. Data was represented using pie charts, frequency and percentages while Chi –Square was used to determine the association between the variables. Results: Knowledge, attitude <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> the principles of exercise prescription among Physiotherapists in Nigeria were high and no significant relationship was found between their level of education and knowledge of exercise prescription. Similarly, there was no significant relationship between their years of experience and knowledge of exercise prescription.
