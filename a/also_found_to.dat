In 1980, Alvarez, Alvarez, Asaro, and Michel published a seminal paper proposing an extraterrestrial cause for the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (then called the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction). In the years following the publication of their article, the clay was <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> contain soot, glassy spherules, shocked quartz crystals, microscopic diamonds, and rare minerals formed only under conditions of great temperature and pressure.|$|E

5|$|In 1913 {{the crystal}} {{structure}} of sodium chloride {{was determined by}} William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg. This revealed that there were six equidistant nearest-neighbours for each atom, demonstrating that the constituents were not arranged in molecules or finite aggregates, but instead as a network with long-range crystalline order. Many other inorganic compounds were <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> have similar structural features. These compounds were soon described as being constituted of ions rather than neutral atoms, but proof of this hypothesis was not found until the mid-1920s, when X-ray reflection experiments (which detect the density of electrons), were performed.|$|E
5|$|Loss of cell {{viability}} in the jack jumper's venom was researched through cytometry, which measures {{the proportions of}} cells that glow {{in the presence of}} fluorescent dye and 7-Aminoactinomycin D. Examinations of the rapidly reproducing Epstein–Barr B-cells showed that the cells lost viability within minutes when exposed to pilosulin 1. Normal white blood cells were <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> alter easily when exposed to pilosulin 1. However, partial peptides of pilosulin 1 were less efficient at lowering {{cell viability}}; the residue 22 N-terminal plays a critical role in the cytotoxic activity of pilosulin 1.|$|E

5|$|Other {{propulsion}} problems included excessive motor vibrations {{at certain}} speeds which damaged various components (which {{was attributed to}} the removal of a flywheel and to corrosion caused by the fuel problems), and excessive fuel consumption in Collins at high speed (found {{to be caused by}} manufacturing problems with the turbines and turbochargers). The propulsion system was <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be a secondary source of noise: poor design of the exhaust mufflers, weight-saving measures in the generator mountings, and an incorrect voltage supply to the battery compartment exhaust fans were noise-creating factors found and eliminated during studies by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation.|$|E
5|$|Some {{studies of}} FH cohorts suggest that {{additional}} risk factors are generally at play {{when a person}} develops atherosclerosis. In addition to the classic risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes, genetic {{studies have shown that}} a common abnormality in the prothrombin gene (G20210A) increases the risk of cardiovascular events in people with FH. Several studies found that a high level of lipoprotein(a) was an additional risk factor for ischemic heart disease. The risk was <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be higher in people with a specific genotype of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).|$|E
5|$|The {{propellers}} {{themselves were}} <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be poorly manufactured, having {{been shaped by}} hand, {{with at least one}} cast at the wrong pitch. This was rectified by using a five-axis milling machine for future shaping work and replacing the miscast propeller. The material used for the propellers was <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be weaker than expected, developing fatigue cracks after only a few years of use. Instead of going to Kockums, which had started to go into decline {{after the end of the}} Cold War, the submarine project office sent the propeller to the United States Navy for redesigning. Despite the Americans fixing the problems with the propeller design, resulting in significant performance improvements, the Swedish company was dissatisfied with the Australian actions; the dispatch of the propellers was one of the points of contention in the company's legal action in the mid-2000s against the Australian government over ownership of the intellectual property rights to the submarine's design.|$|E

5|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that the}} crew of the train had not been advised that there was a raised fire risk at the time. WCRC was found not to have co-operated fully with the investigation. The ADC found that WCRC's Safety Management System was deficient due to confusion over whether or not {{the crew of the}} train had been informed of the increased fire risk. WCRC failed to inform Network Rail of its plans to try to prevent future incidents of a similar nature. The ADC found that this was in breach of WCRC's Safety Management System. WCRC chairman David Smith instructed his staff that no further correspondence would be gone into over the matter. The ADC found that this instruction was prejudicial to the safe operation of WCRC's Safety Management System. The instruction was later rescinded. WCRC was <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be in breach of its Track Access Contract.|$|E
5|$|British {{knowledge}} of thermonuclear weapons {{was based on}} work done at the Los Alamos Laboratory during the war. Two British scientists, Bretscher and Fuchs, had attended the conference on the Super (as it was then called) there in April 1946, and Chadwick had written a secret report on it in May 1946. The Classic Super design was unsuccessful. Fuchs and John von Neumann had produced an ingenious alternative design, for which they filed a patent in May 1946. This was tested in the American Operation Greenhouse George test in May 1951, but was <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be unworkable. There was also some intelligence about Joe 4 derived from its debris, which was provided to Britain under the 1948 Modus Vivendi. Penney established three megaton bomb projects at Aldermaston. Orange Herald, under Bryan Taylor, a large boosted fission weapon; Green Bamboo an interim thermonuclear design similar to Soviet Layer Cake used in Joe 4 and the American Alarm Clock; and Green Granite, a true thermonuclear design. Orange Herald {{would be the first}} British weapon to incorporate an external neutron initiator.|$|E

5|$|Equality under Article 12(1) {{does not}} require that all persons are treated alike, but rather that all persons in like {{situations}} should be treated alike. Similarly, failing to treat differently persons whose situations are significantly different also amounts to inequality. As such, at the second stage the question to be considered is whether persons falling within the same class are treated equally. Article 12(1) prohibits laws which require that some individuals within a single class should be treated more harshly than others. However, the law is not unconstitutional if all persons discriminated against are equally discriminated against, and all persons not discriminated against are equally not discriminated against. The courts have found this stage to be satisfied where under a statute all citizens are equally liable to prosecution, whereas all non-citizens are equally immune from it. The second stage test was <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> have been satisfied where {{all members of the}} Singapore Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses found to have been in violation of the Societies Act were treated equally.|$|E
5|$|The {{clustering}} of {{the orbits}} of extreme trans-Neptunian objects and raising of their perihelia is reproduced in simulations that include Planet Nine. In simulations conducted by Batygin and Brown swarms of planetesimals that began with large semi-major axis orbits at random orientations and initially interacting with Neptune were sculpted into collinear groups of spatially confined orbits by a distant planet if it is substantially more massive than Earth and on a highly eccentric orbit. These surviving objects were in orbits that were oriented with their long axes anti-aligned {{with respect to the}} massive planet and were roughly co-planar with it. The objects were <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be in resonance with the massive planet. The resonances included high-order resonances, for example 27:17, and were interconnected, yielding an orbital evolution that was fundamentally chaotic, causing their semi-major axes to vary unpredictably on million-year timescales. The perihelia of these objects were also raised temporarily, producing Sedna-like orbits, before being returned to orbits more typical of typical trans-Neptunian objects after several hundred million years. Some of the eTNOs also evolved into orbits perpendicular to the plane of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the First World War {{dramatically}} shifted public perceptions on the propriety of the man's wristwatch, and opened up a mass market in the post-war era. The creeping barrage artillery tactic, developed during the War, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage. Service watches produced during the War were specially designed for the rigours of trench warfare, with luminous dials and unbreakable glass. Wristwatches were <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be needed {{in the air as}} much as on the ground: military pilots found them more convenient than pocket watches for the same reasons as Santos-Dumont had. The British War Department began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917.|$|E

5|$|The {{procedures}} {{used in the}} previous tests were repeated, {{but this time the}} winch cable snagged, and the test samples had to be retrieved by a jeep, exposing its crew to more radiation. The Los Alamos personnel assigned to remove the filters from the B-17 drones had apparently carried out the procedure on X-Ray and Yoke without problems, but this time three of them suffered radiation burns on their hands serious enough to be hospitalized and need skin grafting. One of the men who had carried out the procedure for Yoke was then <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> have burns on his hands and was hospitalized too, but was discharged on 28 May. Once again the drone tank gave trouble, and bogged in the crater, but the soil samples were retrieved by the backup drone tank. Both tanks were subsequently dumped in the ocean.|$|E
5|$|By 02:00 the Chinese attack {{had been}} checked and 3 RAR had redeployed to new {{positions}} in the paddy fields around the railway crossing north of Maenjung-dong. However, amid the confusion the exact dispositions of the companies remained unclear {{for the remainder of}} the night. Australian losses were 12 killed and 64 wounded, the same number as those suffered during their entire advance into North Korea. A number of officers of the battalion were later critical of the decision to withdraw while still engaged, believing that it had been both dangerous and unnecessary, while the lack of detailed planning, reconnaissance and orders were also seen as a factor in the disorganisation that ensued. While A Company had immediately withdrawn as ordered and had suffered a number of casualties in doing so, both B and D Companies, which were commanded by experienced veterans of the 2nd Australian Imperial Force, had delayed doing so until more favourable circumstances prevailed and fared better as a consequence. Yet the following morning a patrol from D Company cleared the abandoned A and B Company positions unopposed. The area was found littered with Chinese dead and equipment. Among the casualties were both Chinese and North Koreans, and it became clear that the Australians had been attacked by a mixed force, estimated at around 1,500 men. Many of those killed were <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> have been carrying demolition charges.|$|E
5|$|EFS, {{a system}} {{found on the}} surface of bones, is thought to show a growth plateau which {{indicates}} that maximum body size and skeletal maturity is reached in an individual. Ampelosaurus has not been known to have EFS, found on most non-titanosaurian sauropods. Magyarosaurus, a closely related titanosaur, Lirainosaurus, a titanosaur related to saltasaurids, Alamosaurus, a saltasaurid, and Phuwiangosaurus, a very basal titanosaur, were <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> have lacked EFS. However, the basal macronarian Europasaurus has been shown to have had EFS, so it was likely just titanosaurians that did not have them. The outer edge of the bones, were EFS would have been found, was well-preserved, and still lacked any fossilized proof of them being present for Ampelosaurus. However, in the PLoS ONE study that found the lack of EFS, the larger specimens were not tested, so Ampelosaurus might have had EFS. This is characteristic of titanosaurs, as diplodocoids and basal macronarians seem to have EFS. A majority of all Ampelosaurus specimens have been found with secondary osteons placed densely in the inner regions of bones, and lightly in outer regions. The osteon orientation found in Ampelosaurus of osteons not only facing across the bone is not typical of Neosauropoda. Also, there is no medullary cavity in any bones of Ampelosaurus. Ampelosaurus seems to have had many ontogenetic stages in its life based on its bone histology.|$|E
