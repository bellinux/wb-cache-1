It was so much fun. I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Forest won the European Cup with a 1–0 {{victory over}} Malmö FF at the Olympiastadion.

After this success Forest bought Asa Hartford and Frank Gray, though Harford was sold on after two months after Taylor realised his limited passing range did not fit Forest's style of play. Forest were denied a third consecutive League Cup win in 1980 after a defeat in the final by Wolverhampton Wanderers.|$|E

5|$|In an {{interview}} {{about the film}} on his website, Anderson discussed problems he encountered in naming his film Fuck instead of a censored version of the word. Anderson <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> call it Fuck, because it succinctly described the film's contents. There were inherent problems with this approach, including an inability to advertise the true title in mainstream media such as The New York Times and Los Angeles Times (they used four asterisks instead), although the real title might be permitted in alternative newspapers such as LA Weekly. Anderson also anticipated problems displaying the film's title during film festivals on theatre marquees.|$|E
5|$|Khan, Chopra, and Rampal {{underwent}} extensive {{martial arts}} training from an expert from the Shaolin Temple. The principal cast received training in {{different kinds of}} martial arts.

After signing to do the film, Chopra was very excited, but a few days later, she became nervous, wondering if {{she would be able to}} do justice to the character. Having seen the original film as a teenager, Chopra avoided watching the film again as she did not wanted to imitate Zeenat Aman's portrayal of Roma. She made a conscious effort to give her own look and style to the character.|$|E
5|$|Casting English-speaking lead {{actors in}} Spaghetti Westerns was a growing {{practice}} {{because it was}} believed to allow international marketability. Marcello Mastroianni had conceived {{the idea of a}} mute gunfighter when he told Corbucci that he had <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> appear in a Western, but would have been held back by his inability to speak English. When Corbucci first met Jean-Louis Trintignant, who was hired for the leading role of the film by Les Films Corona after it was turned down by Franco Nero (who had previously played the title character of Django), he learned that Trintignant did not speak English either. To bypass the need for an English-speaking lead, Corbucci decided to turn Trintignant's character into a mute. At the time, Trintignant was known {{for his role in the}} critically acclaimed romantic drama A Man and a Woman, and is believed to have accepted the role in support of co-producer Robert Dorfmann, who was a friend of his. Silence was his only role in a Spaghetti Western.|$|E

5|$|Karthik Sivakumar (born 25 May 1977), {{better known}} by his stage name Karthi, is an Indian film actor {{who works in}} the Tamil film industry. The younger brother of actor Suriya, Karthi holds a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and master of {{business}} administration in Industrial Engineering. Since he had <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> become a film director, he returned to India and joined Mani Ratnam as an assistant director. He was offered acting roles and made his acting debut in Paruthiveeran in 2007 as the title character, a careless village ruffian, winning critical acclaim and several accolades including the Filmfare Award for Best Actor and a Tamil Nadu State Film Award. His next role was that of a coolie in Aayirathil Oruvan (2010), an adventure film directed by Selvaraghavan.He achieved consecutive commercial successes with his subsequent releases– Paiyaa (2010), Naan Mahaan Alla (2010) and Siruthai (2011).

5|$|Nights: Journey of Dreams {{was first}} conceptualised in November 2005 {{after the release}} of Sonic Team's Shadow the Hedgehog. Game design was {{primarily}} prepared by Takashi Iizuka and took around six months to reach the development process. Iizuka wanted to ensure that the next Nights game would stay faithful to the original, and felt the need to keep the game's concept fundamentally the same while incorporating a variety of new mechanics. Despite the cancellation of Air Nights, Iizuka stressed that he had <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make a sequel and asserted that Sega's exit from hardware manufacturing had no effect on the delay. Iizuka felt that it was the appropriate time to release a Nights game—he felt that the industry was dominated by violence and was keen to release a more family-friendly title. The team realised that Nintendo's upcoming Wii was marketed as a family-orientated console, and factored in its online features and user-friendly design.|$|E
5|$|Peter Molyneux {{stated that}} {{he came up with}} the idea of {{creating}} Theme Park because he felt the business genre was worth pursuing. He said that Theme Park is a game he had <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> create, and wanted to avoid the mistakes of his earlier business simulation game, The Entrepreneur: he wanted to create a business simulation game and make it fun so people would want to play it. In an interview, he explained that the primary reason he created Theme Park was because he wanted players to create their dream Theme Park. Another reason is he wanted players to understand the kind of work running one entails. The three difficulty settings enable players to choose the desired depth: simply having fun creating a theme park, or making all the business decisions too. Molyneux stated that the most difficult part to program was the visitors' behaviour.|$|E
