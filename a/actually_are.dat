5|$|Logan and Mac {{continue}} to make progress on his business school report, but Mac has to call Max (Adam Rose) to continue. Desmond goes skinny dipping at his party, while Mac and Max flirt in front of Logan. Veronica discovers that Desmond’s bag was actually switched with another person’s. Veronica and Piz retrieve it, and on the car ride home, they briefly discuss their kiss at the party before playing a CD with some of Desmond’s unreleased newer material. Keith reconnects with Leo D’Amato (Max Greenfield), who presents a case involving the Fitzpatricks to him. They stake out where the Fitzpatricks are, and Keith sees Vinnie Van Lowe helping them. However, they quickly learn that Vinnie is actually investigating the case and has trapped them in the store. Veronica and Piz supposedly get stuck in traffic and tell Desmond to play some of his newer songs until they get there, but they <b>actually</b> <b>are</b> at the concert venue and just want him to expose the audience to his solo material.|$|E

25|$|The last, the Uwharrie range, {{sometimes}} {{presents a}} succession of elevated ridges, then a number of bold and isolated knobs, which often appear higher than they <b>actually</b> <b>are,</b> due to the relative flatness of the surrounding terrain.|$|E
25|$|The French {{mathematician}} Paul Lévy {{proved the}} following theorem, which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a continuous Rn-valued stochastic process X to <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> n-dimensional Brownian motion. Hence, Lévy's condition can <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> {{used as an}} alternative definition of Brownian motion.|$|R

25|$|While {{wearing a}} flat scuba mask or goggles, objects {{underwater}} will appear 33% bigger (34% bigger in salt water) and 25% closer than they <b>actually</b> <b>are.</b> Also pincushion distortion and lateral chromatic aberration are noticeable. Double-dome masks restore natural sized underwater vision and field of view, with certain limitations.|$|E
25|$|This {{correction}} {{procedure for}} Millikan-Lauritsen plots will become easier to apply when {{a sufficient number}} of measurements of κ have been made, and a better idea is available of what typical values <b>actually</b> <b>are.</b> At present, it seems probable that for most materials κ will lie in the range -1<κ<3.|$|E
25|$|This {{mechanism}} {{would place}} a large traffic {{burden on the}} root servers, if every resolution on the Internet required starting at the root. In practice caching is used in DNS servers to off-load the root servers, and as a result, root name servers <b>actually</b> <b>are</b> involved in {{only a fraction of}} all requests.|$|E

40|$|Consider the {{following}} counterfactual claims: (1) that, if the World Trade Center had not collapsed, everything {{else would have}} been maximally similar to how it <b>actually</b> <b>was</b> (2) that, if the World Trade Center had not collapsed and everything else had been maximally similar to how it <b>actually</b> <b>was,</b> everything else would have been maximally similar to how it <b>actually</b> <b>was.</b> Robert Stalnaker says: Consider a possible world in which A is true, and which otherwise differs minimally from the actual world. “If A, then B ” is true (false) just in case B is true (false) in that possible world. (1968, pp. 33 ‐ 34) On Stalnaker’s analysis, (1) and (2) are equivalent to (S 1) and (S 2), respectively: (S 1) that, in the nearest possible {{world in which the}} World Trade Center did not collapse, everything else is maximally similar to how it <b>actually</b> <b>is</b> (S 2) that, in the nearest possible world in which the World Trade Center did not collapse and everything else is maximally similar to how it <b>actually</b> <b>is...</b>|$|R

25|$|Stellium: At {{least three}} planets linked {{together}} {{in a series of}} continuous conjunctions. The planets will act as if they are all in conjunction with each other, even if not all of them <b>actually</b> <b>are.</b> This pattern gives a huge emphasis to the sign occupied by the planets, regardless of the sun sign.|$|E
25|$|Many {{forms of}} Judaism include {{a belief in}} the {{existence}} of angels, including cherubim within the Jewish angelic hierarchy. The existence of angels is generally accepted within traditional rabbinic Judaism. There is, however, a wide range of beliefs within Judaism about what angels <b>actually</b> <b>are</b> and how literally one should interpret biblical passages associated with them.|$|E
25|$|La Grange is {{the mailing}} address for the {{headquarters}} of Electro-Motive Diesel, formerly General Motors' Electro-Motive Division, a major manufacturer of railroad locomotives and diesel engines. The headquarters, engineering facilities and parts-manufacturing operations <b>actually</b> <b>are</b> located in the adjacent village of McCook; originally, the locomotives were also built there, but in more recent years final assembly has moved to EMD's other facility in Muncie, Indiana.|$|E

25|$|Diving {{masks and}} helmets {{solve this problem}} by {{providing}} an air space {{in front of the}} diver's eyes. The refraction error created by the water is mostly corrected as the light travels from water to air through a flat lens, except that objects appear approximately 34% bigger and 25% closer in water than they <b>actually</b> <b>are.</b> Therefore, total field-of-view is significantly reduced and eye–hand coordination must be adjusted.|$|E
25|$|In other words, once we've {{explained}} {{a perception}} fully {{in terms of}} how it affects us, there is nothing left to explain. In particular, {{there is no such thing}} as a perception which may be considered in and of itself (a quale). Instead, the subject's honest reports of how things seem to them are inherently authoritative on how things seem to them, but not on the matter of how things <b>actually</b> <b>are.</b>|$|E
25|$|Win16 is the API for the first, 16-bit {{versions}} of Microsoft Windows. These were initially {{referred to as}} simply the Windows API, but were later renamed to Win16 {{in an effort to}} distinguish them from the newer, 32-bit version of the Windows API. The functions of Win16 API reside in mainly the core files of the OS: kernel.exe (or krnl286.exe or krnl386.exe), user.exe and gdi.exe. Despite the file extension of exe, these <b>actually</b> <b>are</b> dynamic-link libraries.|$|E

25|$|In Zachman’s opinion, {{the single}} factor that makes his {{framework}} unique {{is that each}} element on either axis of the matrix is explicitly distinguishable {{from all the other}} elements on that axis. The representations in each cell of the matrix are not merely successive levels of increasing detail, but <b>actually</b> <b>are</b> different representations — different in context, meaning, motivation, and use. Because each of the elements on either axis is explicitly different from the others, it is possible to define precisely what belongs in each cell.|$|E
25|$|On Kemp's return, {{even the}} MoD {{were said to}} be {{surprised}} when they reviewed the film as to how close to the action the filming had come. Kemp received praise from the Sergeant's Mess and from Prince Harry, who briefly served in Afghanistan as a forward air controller. It also gave some of the soldiers on the ground the chance to see how close some of the situations they were in <b>actually</b> <b>are,</b> something they don't appreciate at the time in the heat of battle.|$|E
25|$|Micropsia is a {{condition}} affecting human visual perception in which objects {{are perceived to be}} smaller than they <b>actually</b> <b>are.</b> Micropsia can be caused by optical factors (such as wearing glasses), by distortion of images in the eye (such as optically, via swelling of the cornea or from changes {{in the shape of the}} retina such as from retinal edema, macular degeneration, or central serous retinopathy), by changes in the brain (such as from traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, migraines, prescription drugs, and illicit drugs), and from psychological factors. Dissociative phenomena are linked with micropsia, which may be the result of brain-lateralization disturbance.|$|E

25|$|Corbusier's piloti {{perform a}} number of {{functions}} around the house, both inside and out. On the two longer elevations they are flush {{with the face of}} the façade and imply heaviness and support, but on the shorter sides they are set back giving a floating effect that emphasises the horizontal feeling of the house. The wide strip window to the first floor terrace has two baby piloti to support and stiffen the wall above. Although these piloti are in a similar plane to the larger columns below a false perspective when viewed from outside the house gives the impression that they are further into the house than they <b>actually</b> <b>are.</b>|$|E
25|$|This outline, however, {{has many}} exceptions. CB 122–134, which are {{categorized}} as love songs, <b>actually</b> <b>are</b> not: they contain {{a song for}} mourning the dead, a satire, and two educational stories about the names of animals. Another group of spiritual poems may {{have been included in}} the Carmina Burana and since lost. The attached folio contains a mix of 21 generally spiritual songs: a prose-prayer to Saint Erasmus and four more spiritual plays, some of which have only survived as fragments. These larger thematic groups can also be further subdivided, for example, {{the end of the world}} (CB 24–31), songs about the crusades (CB 46–52) or reworkings of writings from antiquity (CB 97–102).|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} {{of individuals with}} micropsia are aware that their perceptions do not mimic reality. Many can imagine the actual sizes of objects and distances between objects. It is common for patients suffering from micropsia {{to be able to}} indicate true size and distance despite their inability to perceive objects as they <b>actually</b> <b>are.</b> One specific patient was able to indicate the dimensions of specific objects with her hands. She was also able to estimate the distances between two objects and between an object and herself. She succeeded in indicating horizontal, vertical, and 45 degree positions and did not find it difficult to search for an object in a cluttered drawer, indicating that her figure-ground discrimination was intact despite suffering from micropsia.|$|E
