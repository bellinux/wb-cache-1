6000|$|LADY CHILTERN. Robert! Oh! it {{is horrible}} that I {{should have to}} ask you such a question—Robert, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> me the whole truth? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is {{that you}} are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking of? What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What {{strange things}} these <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> us of, Sir,' said Mr. Pickwick, {{minutely}} scanning the old man's countenance, by {{the aid of}} his glasses.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well,' I said, 'and what {{particular}} {{sort of a}} prize-winner <b>are</b> <b>you?</b> <b>Tell</b> me {{all about}} the ribbons they gave you at the Crystal Palace, and let's get it over.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, never mind; I'll find it {{out from}} himself soon. By the way, what <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> me about explosions {{yesterday}} when that little white gull came to admire your pretty face, and took off our attention?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{the devil}} {{do you know}} about the colour of her eyes?" [...] demanded Eustace heatedly. [...] "Am I telling you about her, or <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|A few stars {{had come}} out on the blue obscurity, clear as crystal, of the sky. The dry, thin voice of the Chevalier spoke harshly: [...] "Why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> me all this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, if he {{have more}} {{wonderful}} attributes than these," [...] said Elinor, laughing, [...] "Boston is a perilous abode {{for the poor}} gentleman. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> me of a painter, or a wizard?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The Baron Sampsono Brasso and {{his fair}} sister <b>are</b> (<b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me) at the Play?' said Mr Swiveller, leaning {{his left arm}} heavily upon the table, and raising his voice and his right leg after {{the manner of a}} {{theatrical}} bandit.|$|R
6000|$|... "It can't be helped--or rather I don't {{want to help}} it. I've pledged my {{word and}} honor to see this {{undertaking}} through, and I mean to redeem it if it ruins me. Now what <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> me about Mrs. Leslie?" ...|$|R

6000|$|The two old men quickly {{came back}} together, and Dr. Woodford began, [...] "How now, niece, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> us dreams?" [...] but {{he broke off}} as he saw the sad earnest of her face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I wouldn't {{tell him}} so, but I think your sister would show more power in {{converting}} a young fellow like Ussher than poor Cullen. And then, {{as to his}} riding down the poor; you know every one must do his duty, and if the boys will be acting against the laws, why, of course, they must bear the consequences. Not but that I think Captain Ussher is too hard upon them. But, Thady, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> me the truth in this? Is it not that you fear the young man won't marry Feemy, rather than that he will?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mellish did all right, but the rotter couldn't {{keep it to}} himself. Went {{and told}} the Old Man. The Old Man sent for me. He was as decent as {{anything}} at first. That was just his guile. He made me describe exactly where I had seen the paper, and so on. That was rather risky, of course, but I put it as vaguely as I could. When I had finished, he suddenly whipped round, and said, [...] "Bradshaw, why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> me all these lies?" [...] That's {{the sort of thing}} that makes you feel rather a wreck. I was too surprised to say anything.' ...|$|E
6000|$|MOORE. That's right enough; but I ain't a-going {{to stand}} {{here all day}} for him. I'm for a drop of {{something}} short, I <b>am.</b> <b>You</b> <b>tell</b> him I showed you that (showing his doubled fist). That's wot's the matter with him. (He lurches out, R.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't turn me out!" [...] he repeated. [...] "Help {{me against}} myself. I <b>am</b> <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> the truth. As God is my witness, I <b>am</b> <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> the truth!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Everything I say <b>is</b> nonsense,--while <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me one {{day that}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> going to hang yourself, and another day that you will drown yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|It was now {{the turn}} of Lieut. Feraud to be astonished. [...] "What the devil <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> me there?" [...] he murmured, faintly, and fell into such {{profound}} wonder that he could only follow mechanically the motions of Lieut. D'Hubert. The two officers, one tall, with an interesting face and a moustache the colour of ripe corn, the other, short and sturdy, with a hooked nose and a thick crop of black curly hair, approached the mistress {{of the house to}} take their leave. Madame de Lionne, a woman of eclectic taste, smiled upon these armed young men with impartial sensibility and an equal share of interest. Madame de Lionne took her delight in the infinite variety of the human species. All the other eyes in the drawing-room followed the departing officers; and when they had gone out one or two men, who had already heard of the duel, imparted the information to the sylph-like ladies, who received it with faint shrieks of humane concern.|$|E

6000|$|She {{gave him}} her quietest attention, but he {{by this time}} saw that, so far as telling her all was concerned, she would be divided between the wish and the {{reluctance}} to hear it; between the curiosity that, not unnaturally, would consume her and the opposing scruple of a respect for misfortune. The more she studied him too--and he had never so felt her closely attached to his face--the more the choice of an attitude would become impossible to her. There would simply be a feeling uppermost, and the feeling wouldn't be eagerness. This perception grew in him fast, and he even, with his imagination, had {{for a moment the}} quick forecast of her possibly breaking out at him, should he go too far, with a wonderful: [...] "What horrors <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> me?" [...] It would have the sound--wouldn't it be open to him fairly to bring that out himself?--of a repudiation, for pity and almost for shame, of everything that in Venice had passed between them. Not that she would confess to any return upon herself; not that she would let compunction or horror give her away; but it was in the air for him--yes--that she wouldn't want details, that she positively wouldn't take them, and that, if he would generously understand it from her, she would prefer to keep him down. Nothing, however, was more definite for him than {{that at the same time}} he must remain down but so far as it suited him. Something rose strong within him against his not being free with her. She had been free enough about it all, three months before, with him. That was what she was at present only in the sense of treating him handsomely. [...] "I can believe," [...] she said with perfect consideration, [...] "how dreadful for you much of it must have been." ...|$|E
