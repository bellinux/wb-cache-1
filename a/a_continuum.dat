50|$|In linguistics, {{the range}} of dialects spoken over a {{geographical}} area that differ slightly between neighboring areas is known as <b>a</b> dialect <b>continuum.</b> <b>A</b> language <b>continuum</b> is <b>a</b> similar description for the merging of neighboring languages without a clear defined boundary.

5|$|Khmer dialects, {{although}} mutually intelligible, {{are sometimes}} quite marked. Notable variations {{are found in}} speakers from Phnom Penh (Cambodia's capital city), the rural Battambang area, the areas of Northeast Thailand adjacent to Cambodia such as Surin province, the Cardamom Mountains, and southern Vietnam. The dialects form <b>a</b> <b>continuum</b> running roughly north to south. Standard Cambodian Khmer is mutually intelligible with the others but a Khmer Krom speaker from Vietnam, for instance, may have great difficulty communicating with a Khmer native of Sisaket Province in Thailand.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{morphology}} recognises <b>a</b> <b>continuum</b> {{between the}} major morphological categories of root, stem (caulome), leaf (phyllome) and trichome. Furthermore, it emphasises structural dynamics. Modern systematics {{aims to reflect}} and discover phylogenetic relationships between plants. Modern Molecular phylogenetics largely ignores morphological characters, relying on DNA sequences as data. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants enabled the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group to publish in 1998 a phylogeny of flowering plants, answering {{many of the questions}} about relationships among angiosperm families and species. The theoretical possibility of a practical method for identification of plant species and commercial varieties by DNA barcoding is the subject of active current research.|$|E

These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a clinical assessment by a mental health professional. Symptoms associated with schizophrenia occur along <b>a</b> <b>continuum</b> in the population and must reach a certain severity and level of impairment, before a diagnosis is made. As of 2013 there is no objective test.|$|E
40|$|We use recent {{developments}} in local entropy theory to prove that chaos in dynamical systems implies the existence of complicated structure in the underlying space. Earlier Mouron proved that if X is <b>an</b> arc-like <b>continuum</b> which admits <b>a</b> homeomorphism f with positive topological entropy, then X contains an indecomposable subcontinuum. Barge and Diamond proved that if G is a finite graph and f:G → G is any map with positive topological entropy, then the inverse limit space (G,f) contains <b>an</b> indecomposable <b>continuum.</b> In this paper we show that if X is <b>a</b> G-like <b>continuum</b> for some finite graph G and f:X → X is any map with positive topological entropy, then (X,f) contains <b>an</b> indecomposable <b>continuum.</b> <b>As</b> a corollary, we obtain {{that in the case}} that f is a homeomorphism, X contains <b>an</b> indecomposable <b>continuum.</b> Moreover, if f has uniformly positive upper entropy, then X is <b>an</b> indecomposable <b>continuum.</b> Our results answer some questions raised by Mouron and generalize the above mentioned work of Mouron and also that of Barge and Diamond. We also introduce a new concept called zigzag pair which attempts to capture the complexity of a dynamical systems from the continuum theoretic perspective and facilitates the proof of the main result...|$|R

5|$|The person's {{understanding}} {{of his or}} her mental illness is evaluated by exploring his or her explanatory account of the problem, and {{understanding of}} the treatment options. In this context, insight can be said to have three components: recognition that one has a mental illness, compliance with treatment, and the ability to re-label unusual mental events (such as delusions and hallucinations) as pathological. As insight is on <b>a</b> <b>continuum,</b> the clinician should not describe it as simply present or absent, but should report the patient's explanatory account descriptively.|$|E
5|$|The secotioid and gasteroid {{species in}} Lactarius and Russula {{are derived from}} agaricoid forms. Secotioid species still have a stipe but the cap does not open fully, while in gasteroid species, fruitbodies are {{completely}} closed and the stipe is reduced; in both cases, the spore-bearing structure {{is made up of}} convoluted gills that are more or less crowded and anastomosed. These closed-fruitbody species represent <b>a</b> <b>continuum</b> of secotioid to gasteroid, above-ground to below-ground fruitbodies, with spores forcibly discharged or not. Secotioid or gasteroid Lactarius exude latex just like their agaricoid relatives.|$|E
5|$|The victim, as {{presented}} by Goya, is as anonymous as his killers. His entreaty is addressed not to God {{in the manner}} of traditional painting, but to an unheeding and impersonal firing squad. He is not granted the heroism of individuality, but is merely part of <b>a</b> <b>continuum</b> of victims. Beneath him lies a bloody and disfigured corpse; behind and around him are others who will soon share the same fate. Here, for the first time, according to biographer Fred Licht, nobility in individual martyrdom is replaced by futility and irrelevance, the victimization of mass murder, and anonymity as a hallmark of the modern condition.|$|E

5|$|A {{transitional}} fossil is any fossilized {{remains of}} a life form that exhibits traits common to both an ancestral group and its derived descendant group. This is especially important where the descendant group is sharply differentiated by gross anatomy and mode of living from the ancestral group. These fossils serve {{as a reminder that}} taxonomic divisions are human constructs that have been imposed in hindsight on <b>a</b> <b>continuum</b> of variation. Because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, there is usually no way to know exactly how close a transitional fossil is to the point of divergence. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that transitional fossils are direct ancestors of more recent groups, though they are frequently used as models for such ancestors.|$|E
5|$|Animal testing, {{also known}} as animal experimentation, animal {{research}} and in vivo testing, {{is the use of}} non-human animals in experiments that seek to control the variables that affect the behavior or biological system under study. This approach can be contrasted with field studies in which animals are observed in their natural environments. Experimental research with animals is usually conducted in universities, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, defense establishments and commercial facilities that provide animal-testing services to industry. The focus of animal testing varies on <b>a</b> <b>continuum</b> from pure research, focusing on developing fundamental knowledge of an organism, to applied research, which may focus on answering some question of great practical importance, such as finding a cure for a disease. Examples of applied research include testing disease treatments, breeding, defense research and toxicology, including cosmetics testing. In education, animal testing is sometimes a component of biology or psychology courses. The practice is regulated to varying degrees in different countries.|$|E
5|$|In the r/K-selection model, {{the first}} {{variable}} r is the intrinsic {{rate of natural increase}} in population {{size and the}} second variable K is the carrying capacity of a population. Different species evolve different life-history strategies spanning <b>a</b> <b>continuum</b> between these two selective forces. An r-selected species is one that has high birth rates, low levels of parental investment, and high rates of mortality before individuals reach maturity. Evolution favours high rates of fecundity in r-selected species. Many kinds of insects and invasive species exhibit r-selected characteristics. In contrast, a K-selected species has low rates of fecundity, high levels of parental investment in the young, and low rates of mortality as individuals mature. Humans and elephants are examples of species exhibiting K-selected characteristics, including longevity and efficiency in the conversion of more resources into fewer offspring.|$|E

5|$|The blues is a {{genre of}} African American folk {{music that is}} the basis for much of modern American popular music. Blues can be seen as part of <b>a</b> <b>continuum</b> of musical styles like country, jazz, ragtime, and gospel; though each genre evolved into {{distinct}} forms, their origins were often indistinct. Early forms of the blues evolved in and around the Mississippi Delta in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The earliest blues music was primarily call and response vocal music, without harmony or accompaniment and without any formal musical structure. Slaves and their descendants created the blues by adapting the field shouts and hollers, turning them into passionate solo songs. When mixed with the Christian spiritual songs of African American churches and revival meetings, blues became the basis of gospel music. Modern gospel began in African American churches in the 1920s, in the form of worshipers proclaiming their faith in an improvised, often musical manner (testifying). Composers like Thomas A. Dorsey composed gospel works that used elements of blues and jazz in traditional hymns and spiritual songs.|$|E
