5|$|By <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> the Allied nations, in March 1942 the Pacific theatre {{was divided}} into two {{separate}} commands, {{each with its own}} commander-in-chief. The South West Pacific Area, which included Australia, Indonesia, and the Philippines came under General Douglas MacArthur as supreme commander. Most of the remainder, known as the Pacific Ocean Areas, came under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. There was no overall commander, and no authority capable of resolving competing claims for resources, setting priorities, or shifting resources from one command to the other. Such decisions had to be {{made on the basis of}} compromise, cooperation and consensus.|$|E
5|$|Eveline was an {{inspiration}} for many of Balzac's characters. She {{can be seen as}} the model for La Fosseue, Mme Claes, Modesta Mignon, Ursule Mirouet, Adelina Houlot, and especially Eugenie Grandet and Mme de Mortsauf. There is less <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> scholars on whether she was also the inspiration for more negative characters such as Fedora and lady Dudley, as Balzac seems to have used her mostly as a model for more positive personas. His works also mention numerous characters named Eve or Eveline, and have several dedications to her.|$|E

5|$|Chamberlain {{sought to}} build an {{interlocking}} series of defence pacts among the remaining European countries {{as a means of}} deterring Hitler from war. He sought an <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> Britain, France, the USSR and Poland whereby the first three would go to the assistance of Poland if her independence were threatened, but Polish mistrust of the Soviet Union caused those negotiations to fail. Instead, on 31 March 1939, Chamberlain informed an approving House of Commons of British and French guarantees that they would lend Poland all possible aid in the event of any action which threatened Polish independence. In the ensuing debate Eden stated that the nation was now united behind the government. Even Churchill and Lloyd George praised Chamberlain's government for issuing the guarantee to Poland.|$|E
5|$|The delegates {{voted to}} address the {{platform}} before deciding on nominees, and debate began when they reconvened at 8:45p.m. Many fights and compromises had been hashed out in the Resolutions Committee already, but the delegates insisted on debating several provisions. On many planks, there was widespread <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> the delegates. On the monetary issue, the platform declared that all money, whether metal or paper, should be issued by the government, not by banks (as was common for paper money at the time). They also called for the unlimited coinage of silver and the repayment of the national debt in bonds, rather than gold dollars. Other planks of the platform called for a graduated income tax, laws to mandate safe working conditions in factories, the regulation of interstate commerce, {{and an end to}} child and convict labor; all of these were familiar parts of Greenback platforms from earlier elections, and provoked no serious dissent.|$|E

5|$|Han Chinese power {{during the}} tumultuous post-Tang era was {{represented}} by the Song dynasty (9601279), which completed its unification of the Chinese states with the conquest of Wuyue in 971. Turning to the north after this victory, in 979 the Song eliminated the Northern Han, ultimate successors to the Later Jin, but were unable to take the Sixteen Prefectures from the Liao dynasty. As a result of Song's military aggression, relations between the Song and Liao remained tense and hostile. One of the battlegrounds in the Song–Liao War was the Great Wall Gap (長城口), so named because the southern Yan wall of the Warring States period crossed the Juma River here into Liao territory. The Great Wall Gap saw action in 979, 988989, and 1004, and a Song fortress was built there in 980. Intermittent wars between the Song and the Liao lasted until January 1005, when a truce was called {{and led to the}} Treaty of Chanyuan. This <b>agreement,</b> <b>among</b> other things, required the Song to pay tribute to the Liao, recognized the Song and Liao as equals, and demarcated the Song–Liao border, the course of which became more clearly defined in a series of subsequent bilateral agreements. Several stretches of the old Great Walls, including the Northern Qi Inner Wall near the Hengshan mountain range, became the border between the Song and the Liao.|$|E
5|$|In July 1942, the Joint Chiefs of Staff {{approved}} {{a series of}} operations against the Japanese bastion at Rabaul, which blocked any Allied advance along the northern coast of New Guinea towards the Philippines or northward towards the main Japanese naval base at Truk. In keeping with the overall Allied grand strategy of Europe first, the immediate aim of these operations was not the defeat of Japan but merely {{the reduction of the}} threat posed by Japanese aircraft and warships based at Rabaul to air and sea communications between the United States and Australia. By <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> the Allied nations, in March 1942 the Pacific theatre was divided into the South West Pacific Area, under General Douglas MacArthur, and the Pacific Ocean Areas, under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. Rabaul fell within MacArthur's area but the initial operations in the southern Solomon Islands came under Nimitz. The Japanese reaction was more violent than anticipated and some months passed before the Guadalcanal Campaign was brought to a successful conclusion. Meanwhile, General MacArthur's forces—primarily Australian—fought off a series of Japanese offensives in Papua in the Kokoda Track Campaign, Battle of Milne Bay, Battle of Buna-Gona, and the Battle of Wau.|$|E
5|$|Puritans {{believed}} that God is sovereign {{over all of}} history and nature and that none of what were called his decrees would be frustrated. There was significant debate in the Assembly over the relationship of God's decree of predestination, or choice to save some people, to the redemption purchased by Christ's death. Many of the Reformed during this period taught that Christ died with the purpose only to save those who were eternally chosen to be saved, a doctrine called particular redemption. A vocal minority of the divines of the Assembly argued for a position known as hypothetical universalism. Edmund Calamy held such a view, and he argued that Christ's death, as well as saving {{those who had been}} chosen, offered salvation to all people on condition that they believe. The Assembly's Confession did not teach such a view, and its language is much more amenable to a particular redemption interpretation, but there is a general <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> scholars that the Confession's language allows an hypothetical universalist interpretation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of trade <b>agreements</b> <b>among</b> SAARC {{countries}} on intraregional exports using a generalized gravity model and panel dataset for the period 1971 to 2005. Empirical tests find scant evidence of {{the impact of}} trade agreements on exports for the pre-SAARC and pre-SAPTA periods, but statistically significant and positive impact is observed in the post-SAARC and post-SAPTA periods even amidst sustained significant neg-ative impact of conflict in all sub-periods. This propensity is discernible regardless of the esti-mation methods applied. However, further tests show that the positive impact emanated not expressly owing to SAPTA per se, but it is rather the effect arising from the delayed impact of the existing trade <b>agreements</b> <b>among</b> the SAARC countries...|$|R
