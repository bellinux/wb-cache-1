5|$|Almost all of {{the county}} is covered by the lowest/most local form of English local government, the civil parish, with either a town or parish council (a city council in the {{instance}} of Wells) or a parish meeting; some parishes group together, with <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>council</b> or meeting for the group. The city of Bath (the area of the former county borough) {{and much of the}} town of Taunton are unparished areas.|$|E
5|$|Under the Merger Treaty of 1967, the ECSC's Special Council of Ministers and the Council of the EAEC (together {{with their}} other {{independent}} institutions) were merged into the Council of the EEC, which {{would act as}} <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>Council</b> of the European Communities. In 1993, the Council adopted the name 'Council of the European Union', following {{the establishment of the}} European Union by the Maastricht Treaty. That treaty strengthened the Council, with the addition of more intergovernmental elements in the three pillars system. However, {{at the same time the}} Parliament and Commission had been strengthened inside the Community pillar, curtailing the ability of the Council to act independently.|$|E

2500|$|Self-government {{has given}} chiefs and their councils powers which combine {{those of a}} province, school board, health board and municipality.

2500|$|Since July 1, 1961, {{the city}} has {{operated}} within the Faulkner Act, formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law, under a Mayor-Council form of government. [...] Under this form of government, the City Council consisted of seven Council members originally all elected at-large. In 1994, the City divided the city into four council districts, instead of electing the entire Council at-large, with <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>council</b> member elected {{from each of the}} four districts. In 1995, the elections were changed from a partisan vote to a non-partisan system.|$|E

2500|$|In Calcutta, the Governor-General {{remained}} {{head of the}} Government of India and now {{was more}} commonly called the Viceroy {{on account of his}} secondary role as the Crown's representative to the nominally sovereign princely states; he was, however, now responsible to the Secretary of State in London and through him to Parliament. A system of [...] "double government" [...] had already been in place during the Company's rule in India from the time of Pitt's India Act of 1784. The Governor-General in the capital, Calcutta, and the Governor in a subordinate presidency (Madras or Bombay) was each required to consult his advisory council; executive orders in Calcutta, for example, were issued in the name of [...] "Governor-General-in-Council" [...] (i.e. the Governor-General with the advice of the Council). The Company's system of [...] "double government" [...] had its critics, since, {{from the time of the}} system's inception, there had been intermittent feuding between the Governor-General and his Council; still, the Act of 1858 made no major changes in governance. However, in the years immediately thereafter, which were also the years of post-rebellion reconstruction, Viceroy Lord Canning found the collective decision making of the Council to be too time-consuming for the pressing tasks ahead, so he requested the [...] "portfolio system" [...] of an Executive Council in which the business of each government department (the [...] "portfolio") was assigned to and became the responsibility of <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>council</b> member. Routine departmental decisions were made exclusively by the member, but important decisions required the consent of the Governor-General and, in the absence of such consent, required discussion by the entire Executive Council. This innovation in Indian governance was promulgated in the Indian Councils Act 1861.|$|E

5|$|Above all, however, Joseph {{attempted}} {{to break up}} the structure of autonomous states which provided the framework for the Austrian Netherlands. He introduced two reforms in early 1787 instituting new administrative and judicial reform to create a much more centralised system. The first decree abolished many of the administrative structures which had existed since the rule of Emperor Charles V (1500–58) were replaced by <b>a</b> <b>single</b> General <b>Council</b> of Government under a minister-plenipotentiary. In addition, nine administrative circles (cercles), each controlled by an Intendant, were created to which much {{of the power of the}} states was devolved. A second decree abolished the ad hoc semi-feudal or ecclesiastical courts operated by the states and replaced them with a centralised system similar to that already in place in Austria. <b>A</b> <b>single</b> Sovereign <b>Council</b> of Justice was established in Brussels, with two appeal courts in Brussels and Luxembourg, and around 40 local district courts.|$|R
