40|$|Despite the {{abundance}} of horticultural crops, farmers in the Nusa Tenggara Timur province of Indonesia (NTT) are still living under poverty level. The Indonesian government has identified <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>workers</b> as a 'point of spear' of agricultural development and given them 12 roles. Horticultural agribusiness would certainty be able to increase farmers' standard of living if <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>workers</b> can perform their roles effectively. However, in 1997, the average production of fruits was only 3. 8 tonnes per hectare and 1. 9 tonnes per hectare of vegetables. Ashraf (1993) has suggested that inefficiency of <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>workers</b> {{is one of the}} reasons why agricultural production does not improve to its full capacity. A study investigating the roles of <b>Agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>workers</b> in horticultural agribusiness in Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT) Indonesia was conducted. Interviews were conducted of 223 farmers, 46 <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>workers</b> and 32 government officers. A literature search suggests this is the first study ever done in Indonesia particularly in NTT which involved farmers, <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>workers</b> and government officers to investigate: 1) what roles were expected of <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>workers</b> by farmers, government officers and <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>workers,</b> 2) the perceptions of these groups about the effectiveness of <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>workers</b> in performing their roles, and 3) factors that impede <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> workers' ability to perform their roles effectively. While the views of the three groups did not coincide, all three expected <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>workers</b> to use examples and demonstrations. All farmers expected <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>workers</b> to deliver <b>extension</b> in the right time. Both farmers and government officers expected <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>workers</b> to increase farmers' knowledge and skills, empower farmers and their group, and to be a part of farmers' community. Meanwhile, the roles of running activities that only deal with the agricultural activities, to support research recommendation, and to be the bridge between farmers and government were expected by government officers and <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>workers.</b> Farmers and <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>workers</b> have the same expectation for <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>workers</b> to transfer programs that suit. farmers' needs and problems, and to bring the programs as promised. The respondents perceptions about the effectiveness of <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>workers</b> in fulfilling their 12 roles were as follows: 1) farmers were dissatisfied with the roles for running plot demonstrations, program planning, using a brochure and running a field school; 2) <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>workers</b> were dissatisfied with the roles of making a brochure, running a field school, and delivering government projects; and 3) government officers were dissatisfied with the roles to encourage farmers' participation, finding and solving farmers' problems, <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>workers</b> as trainers, and running field schools. A Chi-square test found a significant difference between the groups in their perceptions of <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>workers</b> performance of their roles. The eight main constraints that impede <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> workers' ability to perform their roles were the repeated restructuring of the Agricultural Department, low award or salary, lack of training, lack of transport, unclear job direction geographical conditions, lack of authority, and bureaucratic complexity. In conclusion, while the results of this study support the hypothesis that <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>workers</b> are not performing their roles effectively there are a number of reasons for this, many of them beyond the responsibility of <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>workers.</b> A key reason appears to be system failure. While the NTT province is supposedly following the Training and Visit model, very little effective training appears to be taking place and <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>workers</b> lack transport and other facilities to conduct effective visits and demonstrations.

40|$|The Indonesian {{government}} {{and the government of}} Nusa Tenggara Timur recognise that horticulture is economically important and is expected to become the leading agribusiness sector to overcome poverty for farmers. Hence, in the last 20 years, the government of Nusa Tenggara Timur through various agribusiness projects has encouraged the planting of more than 18, 490 hectares of vegetables and 82, 010 hectares of fruit. The major producing areas of both are in the Kupang district and in the Timor Tengah Selatan. However, productivity is low. If production can be increased, on-farm income may also increase, but this is dependent upon <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Extension</b> <b>Workers</b> performing their roles more effectively.

40|$|The authors {{present a}} new {{approach}} to evaluating the level of effective literacy in a region or country, one that takes into account the presence in a household of a literate person. They characterize the approach and give an empirical illustration of its use. They designed the new measures of literacy because traditional measures of the literacy rate (R) ignore how the presence of literate person in the household affects literacy. They contend that literate household members generate a positive externality [...] a kind of public good - for illiterate members. They believe their new measures will be superior to R in predicting or explaining other achievements that depend on literacy. They expect the rate of diffusion of a new technology for farming, for example, to be more closely linked to the effective literacy rate than to the usual literacy rate. If an <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>worker</b> leaves behind a brochure explaining how to plant and care for high-yielding varieties, an illiterate person who lives in a household with at least one literate member has access to that public good; an isolated illiterate - whose household has not literate members - may not have. Similarly, if the presence (or absence) of one literate household member increases the chance of a child becoming literate, so the effective literacy rate should be a better predictor of future generations'literacy rate should be a better predictor of future generations'literacy levels. Some changes in policy emphasis might be expected if the new effective literacy measures are used. There might be a shift, for example, toward ensuring a better distribution of literacy across households or toward addressing more seriously the problem of female illiteracy. More work is needed to determine if a child in a household with a higher percentage of literate adults has more frequent access to literacy skills.

40|$|At 5 : 30 am, Moussa Ong´ayo, an {{extension}} worker in Kakamega, is already {{excited by the}} prospect of his first wireless video conference in one of his villages. He activates his personal portable assistant (PPA), and tells it to download his mailbox and display the new messages on the flat screen above his breakfast table. Later, over a cup of tea, he reads his mail and dictates responses, which his PPA records, processes and automatically dispatches by email or text message. Then he calls up today´s weather map and asks his PPA to download and overlay on it satellite images showing the crops currently being grown in the district. He studies the composite image with interest, and makes some mental notes on what to tell the farmers at the meeting planned for today. Suddenly, a locust alert from the national IPM centre pops up on the screen. He dictates a message to a colleague at the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute in Limuru, an expert in the field of indigenous practices, to ask for advice on how to protect crops against locusts. He puts on his new multipurpose watch and looks at the time. He should hurry, this will be a busy day. His PPA displays his ´to-do´ list: one meeting with a farmers´ association, several farm visits and tasks from his support unit. When the PPA has calculated his optimal travel route, it sends text messages to inform everyone of his schedule, he collects some printed flyers (after a video show, farmers always ask for flyers to take home) and packs them in his van. He can still marvel over this vehicle - it is equipped with a public address system, a foldable video screen and a computer system with a docking station for his PPA. When he starts the engine, the computer comes to life and automatically connects to two satellite systems, WorldSpace´s Afristar for a broadband Internet connection, and the Galileo satellite navigation system. En route to his first appointment, Moussa passes one of the district´s weather monitoring boxes. His computer automatically makes contact and downloads the data recorded over the last month. A tune informs him that the data transfer was successful, so he can continue without stopping. Just before he arrives at the farm, the Galileo system warns his PPA to project onto the windscreen in front of him the farmer´s name and the purpose of his visit. He has been asked to assist Catherine Adoyo and her neighbour in solving a land dispute. After the usual greetings, he asks Catherine to call her neighbour, and together they walk to the disputed boundary. Moussa uses the Galileo receiver in his watch to determine the exact boundary. He starts up his laptop, which has a wireless connection to the equipment in the van, logs on to the computer of the land registry office in Nairobi, and downloads the cadastral information on the two farms, including a detailed map. Moussa notes that their farms are located in an area under customary law, and submits a request for any oral records relating to the two farms. He is informed there is a video, in which the respected head of the clan who died five years ago explains the rights of the two women to the disputed land. They decide to settle their dispute in accordance with the deceased man´s explanation. Using a webcam, Moussa scans their irises, and inserts these biometric signatures into an electronic form to register their agreement. His next call takes him to Joseph Wambui who has applied for a bank loan to purchase a new tractor. The bank has asked him to assess Joseph´s creditworthiness. Joseph explains his future plans and Moussa taps the details into his PPA. Later, he connects the PPA to the computer in his van and within seconds, the machine produces a business plan and an assessment of the economic feasibility of Joseph´s ambitions. Within a few seconds, the PPA gathers details of the Joseph´s business performance over the past year from the tax office database, and commodity price projections {{for the next five years}} from the Kenya Agricultural Commodity Exchange. Moussa emails his report and recommendation to the bank manager, and receives confirmation of receipt, and an assurance that a decision will be made within a week. Moussa is eager to be on time for his next appointment - a meeting with the leaders of the local farmers´ association. The local MP has promised to address the meeting over a video link, and will be waiting in his office in Nairobi. While Moussa installs the video conference equipment, his PPA links up with the MP´s office. ´Ladies and gentlemen, the honorable Oscar Chavangi would like to say some words to you from his office in Nairobi´. The MP´s familiar face appears on the screen. ´Fellow citizens, your extension worker Moussa has invited me to be with you today?´. The farmers gasp with surprise. Moussa beams. He has just organized the first wireless video conference in Kakamega. mailto:rutger@contactivity. com Rutger Engelhard is ICT Update´s coordinating editor and managing partner of Contactivity bv in Leiden, the Netherlands.

40|$|One of Zimbabwe s major rivers the Save is {{now just}} a sea of sand. This is {{happening}} to many of our rivers and is due to serious loss of top soil and deforestation. A lot of these problems {{are the result of}} inappropriate methods of land husbandry in conventional agriculture, which is less and less viable in terms of profitability and sustainability. Children should be taught to think about these issues at an early age and learn what alternatives exist. That does not only concern agriculture, food security and income but also how your environment looks and how it can be maintained. SCOPE started in 1994 with one primary school and one secondary school in each of Zimbabwe s nine provinces. The programme is quite straightforward. Two teachers of each participating school are trained in the principles of organic agriculture or permaculture. These can be science teachers or even interested English or mathematics teachers, since agriculture is not a compulsory subject at school. Besides we aim at integrating permaculture in the entire curricula and not treating it as a separate subject. It is meant for the entire school and does not only include gardening or greening the school; it may also involve water harvesting, improvement of health and nutrition, income generation for the school, constructing or growing windbreaks around fields or teachers houses. Furthermore, I see the programme also as an entry point into the communities. What the pupils learn is brought home to their families and villages. Parents are more sceptical of new ideas. They, as well as agricultural officers, go back to what they learned at school when they were young. Children are more adaptive and responsive. Besides, the youth are the future farmers. However, we involve parents and local extension officers. No preconceived plan Representatives of parents, pupils and staff attend a week-long ILUD (Integrated Land-Use Design) workshop at their school, facilitated by SCOPE. The trained teachers then start to discuss the programme with the other pupils, parents and other staff and a plan is made. We do not have a preconceived plan but work on the basis of different designs for different environments at individual schools. The participants together make a situation analysis, which addresses questions like what are the major problems and what are the available resources. We then ask the group the broad question of how they feel the school should look like in 20 years time. That gives a good inventory of interests and wishes. Some want to see fruits, others a garden, more shade on the school grounds or simply a beautiful place. The next step is the actual plotting of the ILUD map and finally a concrete plan of tasks is drawn up: what class could take up which tasks and when should these be finished. The implementation of this design involves contributions by parents and school staff. Parents for instance can supply seedlings of local plants and in turn learn from what is taught to their children and put this into practice. It is amazing what can be achieved in a couple of year s time and what differences emerge between schools. Banana Republic The Chireka primary school in Bindura is now nicknamed the Banana Republic because the school is almost hidden in a wood of banana trees. Bananas are sold to the children during breaks at a much lower rate than on the market. St Vincent Secondary school in Ruwa decided to focuses on ornamental plants like flowers and flowering shrubs. Besides the usual exceptions, the programme caught on well and we now have 54 participating schools, 3 primary and 3 secondary in every province. In 1997, the programme strengthened its partnership with the Minister of Education. They now select the schools, teachers and facilitate finding funds. The government is an important partner, because if you want to change the curricula, you inevitably need to change the workbooks as well as adapt the exams. In that respect the programme is of course not all roses yet. Some teachers find it difficult to deal with permaculture and conventional agriculture in the same time. I think it is actually a good idea to try both out and have the students compare them. A bigger problem is that parents get different messages. On one hand, permaculture through their child s schools, whereas on the other hand the village <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>worker</b> still focuses on conventional agriculture. Farmers depend on the latter for instance for obtaining farmers certificates. Agricultural education and extension receives substantial sponsorship from agro-chemical companies. That gives us a new objective. Besides expanding the current programme to at least one primary and one secondary school in each of the 63 districts, we also want to include permaculture training in teachers and agricultural colleges, where future staff and extension workers are being trained. This programme can be implemented in other countries as well. We were involved in a three-week workshop in Zambia to explain our programme and get a similar initiative started.
