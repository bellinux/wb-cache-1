50|$|<b>Engineering</b> <b>simulation</b> software, {{traditionally}} delivered as an on-premises solution {{through the}} user's desktop, {{is an ideal}} candidate for SaaS delivery. The market for SaaS <b>engineering</b> <b>simulation</b> software is in its infancy, but interest in the concept is growing for similar reasons as interest in SaaS is growing in other industries. The main driver is that traditional <b>engineering</b> <b>simulation</b> software required a large up-front investment in order to access the simulation software. The large investment kept <b>engineering</b> <b>simulation</b> inaccessible for many startups and middle market companies who were reluctant or unable to risk a large software expenditure on unproven projects.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe current way of {{designing}} industrial plants {{relies on the}} communication among experts in the field, and on tools that allow the simulation of the site. Virtual reality (VR) tools are used to visualize and interact with complex 3 D environments in real time, and several <b>engineering</b> <b>simulations</b> employ VR to foresee the results of complex industrial operations. The research project described here presents a Service Oriented Architecture aimed to create a collaborative environment, called CEE (Collaborative Engineering Environment) that integrates VR techniques into a system where the execution of different sequences of <b>engineering</b> <b>simulations</b> is modeled as scientific workflows. The focus {{of this research is}} on the oil & gas industry, particularly offshore engineering, where the project of a new production unit is a lengthy, expensive and usually is conducted by different specialists who are geographically distributed. Among the integrated <b>engineering</b> <b>simulations</b> are those involving structural calculus, hydrodynamics, naval engineering with mooring systems, meteo-oceanography, and others.

40|$|The agile {{manufacturing}} paradigm engenders many new concepts and work approaches for manufacturing operations. A technology often invoked {{in the concept}} of agility is modeling and simulation. Few would disagree that modeling and simulation holds the potential to substantially reduce the product development cycle and lead to improve product reliability and performance. Advanced <b>engineering</b> <b>simulation</b> can impact manufacturing in three areas: process design, product design, and process control. However, despite that promise, the routine utilization of modeling and simulation by industry within the design process is very limited. Advanced simulation is still used primarily in a troubleshooting mode examining design or process problems after the fact. Sandia National Laboratories has been engaged in the development of advanced <b>engineering</b> <b>simulation</b> tools for many years and more recently has begun to focus on the application of such models to manufacturing processes important for the defense industry. These efforts involve considerable interaction and cooperative research with US industry. Based upon this experience, this presentation examines the elements that are necessary for advanced <b>engineering</b> <b>simulation</b> to {{become an integral part of}} the design process...|$|R

40|$|In {{response}} {{to the need to}} develop more sophisticated, higher quality products product developers are more and more expecting <b>engineering</b> <b>simulations</b> to provide them with the data, information, and knowledge required to make design decisions. <b>Engineering</b> <b>simulations</b> provide insight into the behaviour of virtual product designs and have the capacity to be executed many thousands of times to provide a comprehensive coverage of the solution space being explored. However, <b>engineering</b> <b>simulations</b> are only representative of a reduced set of product properties and are bound by the constraints imposed by the fidelity of the underlying physics of the simulation tools being used. In this paper, we will briefly explore a number of different types of <b>engineering</b> <b>simulation</b> that the Virtual Engineering Centre has been involved in creating and consider the value that the data, information and knowledge that each creates to the decision making process. We will also explore how different visualisation methods being used at the Virtual Engineering Centre support decision making by individuals and groups of people in a design review context. Specifically, we will discuss the use of immersive virtual reality in reviewing simulation results and highlight the limitations of using this technology in group decision making using a case study taken from our work with Bentley Motors. We will conclude that whilst virtual technologies provide opportunities to generate data and information early in the product development process, the ever increasing demands for accuracy and fidelity in representation in mature product sectors outstrips the capability of the technology to fully support decision making in a complete virtual world...|$|R

40|$|<b>Engineering</b> <b>simulations</b> like aircraft, {{helicopter}} or safe {{building design}} on massively parallel hardware result in extreme challenges regarding algorithm and software framework development.
