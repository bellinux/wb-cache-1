5|$|He is {{best known}} for {{throwing}} <b>a</b> <b>no-hitter</b> against the Brooklyn Dodgers on August 11, 1950.|$|E
5|$|Humber {{became the}} seventh {{former member of}} the Mets to go on to throw <b>a</b> <b>no-hitter</b> for another team. The other six are Nolan Ryan, Tom Seaver, Mike Scott, Dwight Gooden, Hideo Nomo and David Cone. The New York Mets, at the time of Humber's perfect game, had never had <b>a</b> <b>no-hitter</b> thrown by a player in the 50-year history of the {{franchise}} (Johan Santana has since accomplished this feat).|$|E
5|$|On July 31, 2015, Hamels {{was traded}} to the Texas Rangers along with Jake Diekman in {{exchange}} for Matt Harrison, Nick Williams, Jorge Alfaro, Jake Thompson, Alec Asher, and Jerad Eickhoff. Hamels became the first pitcher to be traded during a regular season after pitching <b>a</b> <b>no-hitter</b> in his final start with the team that traded him. Bert Blyleven had been the last pitcher to pitch <b>a</b> <b>no-hitter</b> in his final start with the team that traded him; after pitching <b>a</b> <b>no-hitter</b> for the Rangers in his final start of the 1977 season, he {{was traded to}} the Pittsburgh Pirates that offseason.|$|E
50|$|In his {{following}} appearance, the Yankees lost <b>a</b> six-inning <b>no-hitter</b> to Mélido Pérez and the White Sox. Likewise, {{that game}} {{is not considered}} <b>an</b> official <b>no-hitter,</b> as the game was shortened to seven innings due to rain; Hawkins {{was still on the}} mound when the game was delayed, and then called off.|$|R
50|$|Kim {{became the}} first Korean high school pitcher ever to pitch <b>a</b> 10-inning <b>no-hitter</b> on July 14, 2007 {{in the second round}} of the Daebung Flag National Championship. In that game, he tossed 11.2 {{scoreless}} innings but gave up a hit in the eleventh inning and the game was not considered <b>an</b> official <b>no-hitter.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cincinnati Reds right-hander Hod Eller pitches <b>a</b> 6-0 <b>no-hitter</b> {{against the}} St. Louis Cardinals.|$|R
5|$|On September 22, Young had <b>a</b> <b>no-hitter</b> through 8⅓ {{innings of}} the game against the Pittsburgh Pirates before pinch hitter Joe Randa hit a two-run home run. This {{would have been the}} first no-hitter in Padres history. It was the first time a Padre had taken <b>a</b> <b>no-hitter</b> into the ninth inning since Andy Ashby on September 5, 1997 vs. the Atlanta Braves. Young had been on pace for a perfect game through 5⅔ innings. Young also took <b>a</b> <b>no-hitter</b> into the eighth inning on May 30 against the Colorado Rockies as a prelude to his June performance. In that game, which marked the first time a pitcher took <b>a</b> <b>no-hitter</b> into the eighth inning during the 2006 season, he {{surrendered}} a double to Brad Hawpe, who had been a teammate in the 1997 Connie Mack World Series, on his first pitch of the eighth inning and 99th {{of the game}}. During Young's next start on June 4 at Pittsburgh, he did not allow a hit for the first 5⅓ innings, making him one of only two pitchers (Steve Trachsel – June 20–25, 2002) to have consecutive starts with at least five hitless innings since the 2000 season.|$|E
5|$|The {{one team}} that has failed to achieve <b>a</b> <b>no-hitter</b> in {{franchise}} history is the San Diego Padres.|$|E
5|$|The only {{franchise}} without <b>a</b> <b>no-hitter</b> in {{its history}} is the San Diego Padres.|$|E

5|$|Humber {{was named}} 2001 Texas High School Class 4A Player of the Year and {{enrolled}} at Rice University {{for the next}} season. Humber flirted with <b>a</b> <b>no-hitter</b> in college, pitching for the Rice Owls baseball team. On April 6, 2002 he held <b>a</b> <b>no-hitter</b> going into the eighth inning against the San Jose State Spartans baseball team. In that contest, he surrendered a pinch hit single in the eighth, but did not allow any runs until a ninth-inning home run.|$|E
5|$|On September 28, 2012 PNC Park saw {{its first}} no-hitter when Reds pitcher Homer Bailey no-hit the Pirates, 1–0. PNC Park {{has yet to}} see <b>a</b> <b>no-hitter</b> or perfect game thrown by a Pirate.|$|E
5|$|While {{pitching}} at Cedarcroft, Pennock threw <b>a</b> <b>no-hitter</b> to catcher Earle Mack, {{the son of}} Connie Mack, {{manager of}} the Philadelphia Athletics, in 1910. Pennock agreed to sign with the Athletics at a later date. Mack signed Pennock in 1912 to play for his collegiate team based in Atlantic City. Pennock's father insisted that he sign under an alias {{in order to protect}} his collegiate eligibility. Pennock threw <b>a</b> <b>no-hitter</b> against a traveling Negro league baseball team, and Mack promoted him to the Athletics. Mack intended for Pennock {{to be one of the}} prospects who would replace star pitchers Eddie Plank, Chief Bender, and Jack Coombs.|$|E

5|$|Andy Hawkins lost a game on July 1, 1990 to the Chicago White Sox {{while on}} the road by the score of 4–0 without {{allowing}} a hit. Because the White Sox were winning entering the ninth inning at home, they did not bat, and thus Hawkins pitched only 8 innings, but the game was considered <b>a</b> <b>no-hitter</b> at the time. However, following rules changes in 1991, the game is no longer counted as <b>a</b> <b>no-hitter.</b> Additionally, Tom L. Hughes held the Cleveland Indians without a hit through the first nine innings of a game on August 6, 1910 but the game went into extra innings and he lost the no-hitter in the tenth inning and ultimately lost the game 5–0.|$|E
5|$|Humber nearly {{achieved}} a no hitter for the 2011 Chicago White Sox twice. On April 25, 2011, {{in the sixth}} start of his career, he took <b>a</b> <b>no-hitter</b> into the seventh inning against the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium but, with one out, Alex Rodriguez singled up the middle, leaving Humber to finish with seven scoreless innings. Later that year he took <b>a</b> <b>no-hitter</b> into the sixth inning against the Washington Nationals on June 26, but ended up earning a 2–1 loss when he surrendered a seventh inning home run to Danny Espinosa. In that contest, Jerry Hairston, Jr. broke up the no-hitter leading off the sixth after Roger Bernadina earned a hit by pitch {{to break up the}} perfect game in the fourth.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{was born}} in Houston, Texas, and {{attended}} Brownwood High School in Brownwood, Texas. He played for the school's baseball team as a pitcher. In his sophomore year, he threw <b>a</b> <b>no-hitter</b> and helped lead his team to the regional semifinals. As a junior in 2008, Miller threw three no-hitters in consecutive games, including one perfect game.|$|E

While pitching for {{the baseball team}} at Millbrook, Shuey threw <b>a</b> <b>no-hitter</b> against Garner High School. He was named to North Carolina's All-Triangle and All-State teams.|$|E
5|$|Culbreth has umpired in five Division Series, six League Championship Series, two World Series and one All-Star Game, {{as well as}} the National League's single-game playoff in 2007. He was one of {{the umpires}} when a Tampa Bay Rays pitcher threw <b>a</b> <b>no-hitter</b> {{for the first time in}} team history, and he was behind the plate when the New York Mets {{achieved}} the same distinction. Prior to the 2013 Major League Baseball season, Culbreth, Ted Barrett and Jim Joyce became crew chiefs after the retirements of Ed Rapuano, Tim Tschida and Derryl Cousins.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Bickford went 16–11 with a 4.25 {{earned run}} average and made the National League All-Star team. He {{finished}} seventh {{in the league in}} complete games (15) and third in games started (36) behind teammate Warren Spahn and Ken Raffensberger of the Cincinnati Reds. He lost <b>a</b> <b>no-hitter</b> in the ninth inning in one of those games. At season's end Bickford, alongside Spahn and teammate Johnny Sain created one of the most formidable pitching trios in the league for the next several years.|$|E

500|$|In {{baseball}} Des Jardien was a pitcher, {{but also}} played {{at first and}} third base. The University of Chicago Magazine wrote: [...] "Des Jardien at third base fields well, and adds strength by his spirit. All in all, the tall young man {{is one of the}} most excellent athletes Chicago has had in years." [...] In May 1914 he threw <b>a</b> <b>no-hitters</b> and struck out 14 Iowa Hawkeyes batters in a game.|$|R

5|$|Lavender {{primarily}} {{threw the}} spitball, {{and used it}} to win 16 games as a 28-year-old rookie in 1912. In July 1912, he defeated Rube Marquard, ending Marquard's consecutive win streak at 19 games, which at the time tied the record for the longest win streak for a pitcher in MLB history. Lavender's early success as a rookie soon turned to mediocrity as his career progressed, winning no more than 11 games in any season afterward. On August 31, 1915, he threw <b>a</b> <b>no-hitter</b> against the New York Giants.|$|E
5|$|Of this list's 40 {{pitchers}}, Valerio de los Santos and Robert Dodd {{share the}} best win–loss record by winning percentage; each won one game while losing none. Duggleby's 90 wins and 99 losses are most {{among the members}} of this list, as are his 445 strikeouts. Dave Downs' 2.74 earned run average (ERA) in the only season of his career is the best mark in that category. Red Donahue is one of the ten Phillies pitchers who have thrown <b>a</b> <b>no-hitter,</b> accomplishing the feat on July 8, 1898.|$|E
5|$|Official scorers {{are only}} {{occasionally}} terminated, {{but there have}} been cases when a scorer was replaced after making decisions which displeased the home team. In 1992 the Seattle Mariner players signed a petition to have their official scorer replaced, and in 2001 the management of the Boston Red Sox ordered that a rookie scorer not be allowed to score another game after pitcher Hideo Nomo lost <b>a</b> <b>no-hitter</b> on a close play in right field that was ruled a hit rather than an error.|$|E
