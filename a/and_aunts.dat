5|$|Born on January 16, 1980, Pujols {{was raised}} in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, mostly by his grandmother, America Pujols, and 10 of his uncles <b>and</b> <b>aunts.</b> He was an only child. His father, Bienvenido Pujols, was a {{softball}} pitcher, {{but he was also}} an alcoholic. Albert often had to take his father home when his father got drunk following the games. Growing up, Pujols practiced baseball using limes for balls and a milk carton for a glove. Pujols, his father, and his grandmother immigrated in 1996 to New York City, where Albert witnessed a shooting at a grocery store. Partly because of the shooting, they moved to Independence, Missouri, two months later to join some relatives.|$|E

25|$|The most {{suitable}} couple is one {{made up by}} crossed cousins. Parallel cousins marriage is forbidden, that being the reason why each man looks for a suitable woman in groups where his maternal sisters <b>and</b> <b>aunts</b> are married and therefore the unmarried are eligible. If the woman {{still lives in the}} home of the father, the gifts must include him. If the woman accepts, she settles down in the encampment of the man and if they have a child then they are considered a formal pair, which establishes mutual relations of kinship, expressed in rights and duties of reciprocity.|$|E

25|$|Friel {{returned}} {{to a position of}} Irish theatrical dominance during the 1990s, particularly with the release of Dancing at Lughnasa {{at the turn of the}} decade. Partly modelled on The Glass Menagerie by Tennessee Williams, it is set in the late summer of 1936 and loosely based on the lives of Friel's mother <b>and</b> <b>aunts</b> who lived in Glenties, on the west coast of Donegal. Probably Friel's most successful play, it premiered at the Abbey Theatre, transferred to London's West End, and went on to Broadway. On Broadway it won three Tony Awards in 1992, including Best Play.

25|$|Gullah {{culture has}} proven to be {{particularly}} resilient. Gullah traditions are strong in the rural areas of the Lowcountry mainland and on the Sea Islands, and among their people in urban areas such as Charleston and Savannah. Gullah people who have left the Lowcountry and moved far away have also preserved traditions; for instance, many Gullah in New York, who went North in the Great Migration {{of the first half of}} the 20th century, have established their own neighborhood churches in Harlem, Brooklyn, and Queens. Typically they send their children back to rural communities in South Carolina and Georgia during the summer months to live with grandparents, uncles, <b>and</b> <b>aunts.</b> Gullah people living in New York frequently return to the Lowcountry to retire. Second- and third-generation Gullah in New York often maintain many of their traditional customs and sometimes still speak the Gullah language.|$|E
25|$|In August 2009, Cattrall {{took part}} in the BBC One {{documentary}} series Who Do You Think You Are?, where she discovered some uncomfortable facts about her grandfather, George Baugh. Baugh, who disappeared in 1938, having abandoned his family – including Cattrall's then 8-year-old mother and two younger sisters – turned out to have bigamously married his new wife, Isabella Oliver, the following year in Tudhoe, County Durham, and subsequently had another four children. She was told that in 1961 he emigrated to Australia, where he became a postmaster, retiring in 1972 and dying in Sydney in 1974. Cattrall's mother <b>and</b> <b>aunts</b> had known nothing of their father's life after he left until they heard what the Who Do You Think You Are? researchers had discovered, nor had the family previously seen a clear photograph of him. An edited version of the episode was later shown {{as a part of the}} U.S. series of the same name.|$|E
