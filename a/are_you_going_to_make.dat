500|$|When Henriksen {{first got}} the script, he mistook {{it for a}} film because of its [...] "powerful" [...] story. He was not fond {{of the idea of}} {{participating}} in a television project. Henriksen contacted Carter about the character; his first question was [...] "How <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> this hero a hero? I mean, it is so dark, {{how are you going to}} handle this?" [...] Carter replied saying that Frank was a hero because he was able to [...] "stand-up" [...] against all of this. Henriksen was also worried about the dark [...] "feel" [...] of the show, saying that all shows needs some glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel. According to Carter [...] "The yellow house" [...] was the light, which Henriksen later agreed upon.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, Kramer {{delivered}} {{the final of}} four drafts of a novel that he wrote about the fast lifestyle of gay men of Fire Island and Manhattan. In Faggots, the primary character was modeled on himself, {{a man who is}} unable to find love while encountering the drugs and emotionless sex in the trendy bars and discos. He stated his inspiration for the novel: [...] "I wanted to be in love. Almost everybody I knew felt the same way. I think most people, at some level, wanted what I was looking for, whether they pooh-poohed it or said that we can't live like the straight people or whatever excuses they gave." [...] Kramer researched the book, talking to many men, and visiting various establishments. As he interviewed people, he heard a common question: [...] "Are you writing a negative book? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it positive? ... I began to think, 'My God, people must really be conflicted about the lives they're leading.' And that was true. I think people were guilty about all the promiscuity and all the partying." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Use? It ruined me! But what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do? How <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> presuppose that a {{girl like}} Miss Pasmer is {{interested}} in an idiot like you? I mean me, of course." [...] Mavering broke off with a dolorous laugh. [...] "And if you can't presuppose it, what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do {{when it comes to}} the point? You've got to shillyshally, and then you've got to go it blind. I tell you it's a leap in the dark." ...|$|R

5000|$|Because {{the noodles}} are {{traditionally}} eaten at weddings, the expression [...] "When <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> feed us guksu?"

6000|$|... "There!" [...] shouted Billson, [...] "what {{have you}} got to say for {{yourself}} now? And what kind of apology <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{to me and to}} this insulted house for the imposture which you have attempted to play here?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Who are you, Martin Eden? {{he demanded}} {{of himself in}} the looking-glass, that night {{when he got back}} to his room. He gazed at himself long and curiously. Who are you? What are you? Where do you belong? You belong by rights to girls like Lizzie Connolly. You belong with the legions of toil, with all that is low, and vulgar, and unbeautiful. You belong with the oxen and the drudges, in dirty {{surroundings}} among smells and stenches. There are the stale vegetables now. Those potatoes are rotting. Smell them, damn you, smell them. And yet you dare to open the books, to listen to beautiful music, to learn to love beautiful paintings, to speak good English, to think thoughts that none of your own kind thinks, to tear yourself away from the oxen and the Lizzie Connollys and to love a pale spirit of a woman who is a million miles beyond you and who lives in the stars!
