5|$|A {{self-described}} anarchist, Baker {{has been}} categorized {{as a writer}} of transgressional fiction, in that his novels are frequently populated by sociopathic, nihilistic characters who engage in taboo behaviors such <b>as</b> <b>heavy</b> drug use, incest, necrophilia and other practices; and often commit acts of extreme, surrealistic violence. A man of eclectic tastes, Baker cited as literary influences writers and film directors ranging from Proust to Jim Thompson and Sam Peckinpah. He also admired the punk writer Dennis Cooper.|$|E

5|$|Heavy {{water is}} a form of water that {{contains}} a larger than normal amount of the hydrogen isotope deuterium, also known <b>as</b> <b>heavy</b> hydrogen, rather than the common hydrogen-1 isotope that makes up most of the hydrogen in ordinary water. Deuterium was discovered by Harold Urey in 1931 and he was later able to concentrate it in water. His mentor Gilbert Newton Lewis isolated the first sample of pure heavy water by electrolysis in 1933.|$|E

Moving on a due west course for nearly two weeks in October 1988, Hurricane Joan caused widespread flooding and over 200 deaths after moving into Central America. Widespread suffering and economic crises were exacerbated by Joan, primarily across Nicaragua, <b>as</b> <b>heavy</b> rains and high winds impacted those near the hurricane's path.|$|E
5|$|In his Commentary on Matthew, however, Origen {{offered a}} {{different}} approach. Answering criticisms {{that there was}} no mention of this incident in any of the many non-Christian sources, he insisted that it was local to Palestine, and therefore would have gone unnoticed outside.

5|$|The P-6 variant was {{the last}} {{production}} model of the He 111 P series. In 1940, the Ministry of Aviation abandoned further production of the P series in favour of the H versions, mostly because the P-series' Daimler-Benz engines were needed for Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Bf 110 fighter production. The remaining P-6s were redesignated P-6/R2s and used <b>as</b> <b>heavy</b> glider tugs. The most notable difference with previous variants was the upgraded DB 601N powerplants.|$|E

5|$|A {{batch of}} 10 were {{produced}} and five were built from existing H-6s. The machines {{were joined by}} a center wing formed by two sections 6.15m (20ft) in length. The powerplants were five Junkers Jumo 211F engines producing 1,000kW (1,340hp) each. The total fuel capacity was 8,570L (2,260US gal). This was increased by adding of four 600L (160US gal) drop tanks. The He111Z could tow a Gotha Go 242 glider or Me 321 for up to 10 hours at cruising speed. It could also remain airborne if the three central powerplants failed. The He 111Z-2 and Z-3 were also planned <b>as</b> <b>heavy</b> bombers carrying 1,800kg (3,970lb) of bombs and having a range of 4,000km (2,500mi). The ETC installations allowed for a further four 600L (160US gal) drop tanks to be installed.|$|E
5|$|Although Panama and Costa Rica {{were not}} in the direct path of Hurricane Beta, storm {{warnings}} were issued for the two countries on October27 <b>as</b> <b>heavy</b> rains, up to 20in (508mm), from the outer bands of Beta were possible. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Panama alerted officials in Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Guatemala about the possible impacts from Beta. Civil defence officials in El Salvador declared a pre-emptive alert due to the possibility of rain-triggered mudslides from the outer bands of Beta.|$|E
