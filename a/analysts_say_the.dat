50|$|<b>Analysts</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> turnout, {{at nearly}} 70 percent, {{indicates}} {{the strength of}} feeling among many ordinary Latvians, who are keen to distance themselves culturally from their former Soviet rulers.

Though the Russians who spearheaded the referendum admitted they had no chance at winning the plebiscite, they at least hope the approximate 25 percent of support will force Latvia's center-right government to begin a dialogue with national minorities. Many fear the disgruntled minority will keep up the pressure by calling for more referendums to change Latvia's constitution for minorities' benefit.|$|E

2500|$|The dairy scandal {{raises the}} core {{question}} of whether the ruling Communist Party is capable of creating a transparent, accountable regulatory structure within a one-party system. Time Magazine cited many <b>analysts</b> <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> party's need to maintain control of the economy and of information undermines the independence of any regulatory system. One analyst, Willy Lam, a Senior Fellow at The Jamestown Foundation, indicated that CCP's pervasive control over political and economic resources has resulted in the absence of meaningful systematic checks and balances. [...] "Institutions that could provide some oversight over party and government authorities—for example, the legislature, the courts or the media—are tightly controlled by CCP apparatchiks." [...] A Beijing-based consultancy, Dragonomics, concurred that [...] "the problem was rooted in the Communist Party's continued involvement in pricing control, company management and the flow of information". Independent regulation was lacking or ineffective as local industries' were so intertwined with local officialdom.|$|R
