5|$|Two British athletes competed, both in alpine skiing events, and no medals were won. The size of {{the team}} was a {{decrease}} from that which had entered previous Games, in the 1998 Winter Paralympics 20 British athletes had participated. One {{reason for this is}} that whilst funding for the two athletes was provided by the British Paralympic Association, it totalled only £1,500 compared to the £4 million worth of funding available to British <b>athletes</b> <b>at</b> the 2002 Winter Olympics.|$|E
5|$|A total {{prize money}} pot of US$245,000 was {{available}} to <b>athletes</b> <b>at</b> the championships, with awards being given those placing from first to sixth in both the individual and team sections.

5|$|All these {{increasingly}} {{long distances}} {{came at a}} price, as illustrated by filmmaker Werner Herzog in his 1974 documentary The Great Ecstasy of Woodcarver Steiner. During both the aforementioned events in Oberstdorf and Planica, several athletes including Steiner had far exceeded {{the limits of the}} hill by 'out-jumping' it or simply 'running out of slope'. Jumps were much further than in the 1950s, during which the old Kongsberger technique was still in use. The results were now potentially fatal each time: athletes were coming only metres away from landing on completely flat ground, or the equivalent of falling from a multi-storey building. Furthermore, only a wool cap and goggles – or no headgear at all – were worn; an antiquated feature left unchanged from the very earliest days of ski jumping more than 150 years prior. In 1979, at their 32nd International Ski Congress in Nice, France, the FIS mandated helmets to be worn by <b>athletes</b> <b>at</b> all ski jumping and flying events.|$|E
