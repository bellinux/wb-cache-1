This claim is supported by reports that moving in an environment of induced sensorimotor conflict leads to elevated pain and sensory symptoms in those with certain painful conditions.

In the present study, we used mirror visual feedback to investigate the effects of sensorimotor incongruence on responses to stimuli that arise from sources external to the body, in particular, touch. Incongruence between the sensory and motor signals for the right arm was manipulated by having the par-ticipants make symmetrical or <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>movements</b> while watching a reflection of their left arm in a parasagittal mirror, or the left hand surface of a similarly positioned opaque board.

A bilaterally symmetrical organism cannot maneuver through a two- or three-dimensional space {{unless and until}} one side of its body leads,because the forces that cause {{the movements of the}} body are generated within the body.

We show—by means of a hypothetical system resembling a humanoid robot—that a laterally <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>movement</b> at a lower level of organization of movements can stimulate laterally asymmetrical movements that are direc- tionally consistent at consecutive higher levels. We show —by comparing two hypothetical systems,incorporating laterally symmetrical and asymmetrical movements, respectively—that the asymmetrical system outperforms the symmetrical system by optimizing space and time and that this space–time advantage increases with the increasing complexity of the task. Together, these results suggest that laterally asymmetrical movements can self-organize as a consequence of space–time optimization...|$|E

The level of performance {{in this type of}} rapid manoeuvre is of direct survival value to the fish, both in terms of prey capture and in terms of predator avoidance. The majority of the lateral muscle is made up of fast anaerobic muscle fibres which power these rapid unsustained movements (e. g. Hudson, 1973; Bone, 1978; Jayne and Lauder, 1993). A distinction can be made between fast-starts and sprint swimming. Fast-starts are kinematic events involving rapid <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>movements</b> of the body. Kinematically, fast-starts are divided into two stages. Stage 1 represents the first muscular contraction when the body is typically thrown into a C or S curve.

40|$|Periodic bimanual {{movements}} {{are often the}} focus of studies of the basic organizational principles of human actions 1 ± 25. In such movements there is a typical spontaneous tendency towards mirror symmetry. Even involuntary slips from <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>movement</b> patterns into symmetry occur, but not vice versa. Traditionally, this phenomenon has been interpreted as a tendency towards co-activation of homologous muscles, probably originating in motoric neuronal structures. Here we provide evidence contrary to this widespread assumption.

We suggest that spontaneous coordination phenomena of this kind are purely perceptual in nature. In the case of a bimanual circling model, our findings reveal that highly complex, even `impossible' movements can easily be performed with only simple visual feedback.

Punch biopsies from the sites investigated by laser Doppler flowmetry were examined by routine histology and monoclonal antibody immunohistology, but revealed no epidermal change and no T lymphocytic excess when the two areas were compared.

An analysis of the ciliary movements that generate these metachronal waves yielded the following results. During the generation of metachronal waves, there were phase differences in the ciliary orientation of adjacent cilia {{in the direction of}} wave propagation. Addition of cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP increased the rotational angular velocities during the effective stroke of ciliary beating, but did not increase the rotational angular velocity of the recovery stroke. When the ATP concentration in the cyclic GMP reactivation medium was increased, the rotational angular velocity during the effective stroke rose steeply and saturated at 0. 8 mmol l 21 ATP, whereas that during the recovery stroke rose gradually. Addition of cyclic nucleotides caused a single cilium isolated from neighbouring cilia on the cortical sheet to incline almost parallel to the cortical surface during the recovery stroke. Addition of cyclic GMP increased the amplitude of bending of cilia detached from the cortical sheet.

Empirical evidence is presented for these costs (about $ 2, 500 per year in the late 1980 s) by measuring the opportunity cost of overtime hours in U. S. manufacturing industries. This protection also gives currently employed workers an incentive to raise wages - as long as continued employment is secure. They outnumber the unemployed who want lower wages by roughly 10 to 1. If wages are determined "democratically" the former group is able to slow down real wage reductions in recessions and speed up wage increases in booms, resulting in the usually observed <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>movements</b> around the natural rate of unemployment.
