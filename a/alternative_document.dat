These responses are evaluated in two dimensions: information content, which measures the amount of relevant and non-redundant information, and document support, which measures the number of alternative sources provided in support of reported information. The final metric in the overall GALE distillation evaluation combines the results of scoring of both query responses and document citations.

40|$|Relevance {{feedback}} query refinement for PDF {{medical journal}} articles This paper addresses relevance feedback {{as an alternative}} to keyword-based search engines for sifting through large PDF document collections and extracting the most relevant documents (especially for literature review purposes). Until now, relevance feedback has only been used in content-based image and video retrieval due to the inability to query those media types without keywords. Since PDF journal articles contain many valuable non-keyword features such as structure and formatting information as well as embedded figures, they would benefit from relevance feedback. Stripping a PDF into “full-text ” for indexing purposes disregards these important features. We discuss how they can be used to our advantage and look to integrate the wealth of knowledge from relevance feedback text-based information retrieval. We argue for the benefits of placing the burden of relevance judgement on the user rather than the retrieval system and present <b>alternative</b> <b>document</b> views that quickly allow the user to deem relevance. 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Document Object Model (DOM) is the {{document}} manipulation API {{provided to the}} JavaScript developer by the browser. It allows to modify parts of the current Web page from a client side script. The principle is interesting and powerful, and no modern Web development could be possible without it. But the implementation is not satisfactory when seeking predictability and reliability, such as expected with declarative languages or static type systems. Primitives are too generic, and when called in abnormal conditions can either throw exceptions or perform implicit imperative actions. In particular, DOM primitives can conditionally and implicitly move nodes in {{the document}}, in a way very difficult to be statically prevented or even detected. In this article, we introduce cDOM, an <b>alternative</b> <b>document</b> model that performs implicit deep copies instead of moves. By not moving their children implicitly, it preserves the structure of nodes after their creation and between explicit mutations. Moreover, it manages to provide a sensible way to duplicate side data embedded in the document (such as event handlers), so that the copies are completely similar in structure to the originals. It thus provides a more usual semantics, over which existing declarative abstractions and type systems {{can be used in}} a sound way...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMost of the {{existing}} information retrieval systems are based on bag-of-words model and are not equipped with common world knowledge. Work has been done towards improving the efficiency of such systems by using intelligent algorithms to generate search queries, however, not much {{research has been done}} in the direction of incorporating human-and-society level knowledge in the queries. This paper {{is one of the first}} attempts where such information is incorporated into the search queries using Wikipedia semantics. The paper presents Wikipedia-based Evolutionary Semantics (Wiki-ES) framework for generating concept based queries using a set of relevance statements provided by the user. The query learning is handled by a co-evolving genetic programming procedure. To evaluate the proposed framework, the system is compared to a bag-of-words based genetic programming framework as well as to a number of <b>alternative</b> <b>document</b> filtering techniques. The results obtained using Reuters newswire documents are encouraging. In particular, the injection of Wikipedia semantics into a GP-algorithm leads to improvement in average recall and precision, when compared to a similar system without human knowledge. A further comparison against other document filtering frameworks suggests that the proposed GP-method also performs well when compared with systems that do not rely on query-expression learning...|$|E
40|$|A layered {{approach}} for identifying {{communities in the}} Web is presented and explored by applying the Flake Exact Community Identification Algorithm to the UK academic Web. Although community or topic identification is a common task in information retrieval, a new perspective is developed by: (a) the application of <b>Alternative</b> <b>Document</b> Models, shifting the focus from individual pages to aggregated collections based upon Web directories, domains and entire sites; (b) the removal of internal site links; and (c) the adaptation of a new fast algorithm to allow fully automated community identification using all possible single starting points. The overall topology of the graphs in the three least aggregated layers was first investigated and found to include {{a large number of}} isolated points but, surprisingly, with most of the remainder being in one huge connected component, exact proportions varying by layer. The community identification process then found that the number of communities far exceeded the number of topological components, indicating that community identification is a potentially useful technique, even with random starting points. Both the number and size of communities identified was dependant on the parameter of the algorithm, with very different results being obtained in each case. In conclusion, the UK academic Web is embedded with layers of non-trivial communities and, if it is not unique in this, then there is the promise of (a) improved results for information retrieval algorithms that can exploit this additional structure, and (b) the application of the technique directly to partially automate Web metrics tasks such as that of finding all pages related to a given subject hosted by a single country’s universities...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{methods to}} aid in the non-visual browsing of web based documcnts, primarily using synthetic speech output. The serial nature of speech ensures that it is a difficult medium in which to browse documents. Much of the structure implied in the visual appearance of the content is not available through specch. Only a narrow region in the content is perceivable at any given time, and it can bc difficult to navigate to the important segments of the document. This is in contrast to visual interaction, where cues such as changcs in font or colour establish contextual changes in the content and guide the user accordingly. A number of browsing/navigation strategies are presented to offset these problems. These are implemented through WebTree. This is a highly customisable web browser which rcnders documents through a dynamically expandable tree structural view. This mirrors the arrangement of mark-up elements in the source file. Contextual information about each element is provided as appropriate. By expanding and collapsing individual tree elements, thc user decides how much of the content is rendered at any given time. The user can also dctermine whether a certain element is automatically expanded in the rendcring when cncountercd, or whether it appcars in the rendering at all, effectively allowing for the easy gencration of <b>alternative</b> <b>document</b> views. To speed up navigation the user can move through the document based on the element of their choice. Specialiscd element search functions are also available. Additional navigational functionality is provided to deal with the specific requirements of or elements. The thesis reviews different methods previously employed to offset problems with auditory interfaces and compares these with WebTree. Initial user tests and evaluations of WebTrec are prescnted, which show that the approaches taken provide a viable solution, particularly for thc browsing of large or complex wcb-bascd documcnts, by blind users...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} a {{semantic}} search approach based on Case-based reasoning and modular Ontology learning. A case is defined {{by a set of}} similar queries associated with its relevant results. The case base is used for ontology learning and for contextualizing the search process. Modular ontologies are designed to be used for case representation and indexing. Our work aims at improving ontology-based information retrieval by the integration of the traditional information retrieval process, the use of ontology learning (OL) and the Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) process.
