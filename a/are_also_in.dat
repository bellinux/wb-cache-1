5|$|A mass {{of granite}} {{now in the}} Panamint Mountains intruded this complex 1400 mya.

Outcrops can be seen along {{the front of the}} Black Mountains in Death Valley and in the Talc and Ibex Hills. When the granite was being intruded, the west coast of North America ran through Eastern California and through an embayment that spread toward the Las Vegas Valley. This embayment, called the Amargosa aulacogen, had highlands north and south of it and {{was the result of a}} failed rift. Many thousands of feet of sediment filled the slowly subsiding basin.|$|E

5|$|As {{the initial}} {{usage of the}} Cunard Building was mixed, {{there are a variety}} of {{features}} within the building that reflect the original purposes of different areas within.

Another feature are the high quality ornate fittings that are present in what would have been the former first class passenger lounge, which is located on the first floor. These fitting <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> the former board room, which is located in a 'commanding' position on the fifth floor, overlooking the river below.|$|E
