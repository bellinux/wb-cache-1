5|$|In April 2015, Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate was {{considering}} {{whether or not}} to prosecute WCRC. The ORR also has powers to prosecute; they subsequently decided to prosecute both WCRS <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> of the train. Although the suspension had been lifted by NR, the ORR could still have revoked WCRC's Safety Certificate {{at the end of the}} 28-day consultation period. The lifting of the suspension by NR was subject to a review after three months.|$|E
5|$|In December 2015, the Office of Rail and Road {{initiated}} a prosecution against {{the driver of}} the train and WCRC for offences under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. The case was heard in June 2016. Both WCRC <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> of the train pleaded guilty. WCRC was fined £200,000 plus costs.

The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the accident was the driver's use of a sedating antihistamine and driver fatigue, due to an irregular work-rest schedule.|$|E
5|$|On 22 March 1990, Achebe {{was riding}} in a car to Lagos when an axle {{collapsed}} and the car flipped. His son Ikechukwu <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> suffered minor injuries, but {{the weight of the}} vehicle fell on Achebe and his spine was severely damaged. He was flown to the Paddocks Hospital in Buckinghamshire, England, and treated for his injuries. In July doctors announced that although he was recuperating well, he was paralyzed from the waist down and would require the use of a wheelchair {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|The Rail Safety and Standards Board {{opened an}} {{investigation}} into the incident. The ORR opened two investigations; one into WCRC's Safety Management System, with the second a criminal investigation. The ORR subsequently charged WCRC <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> of the train with various offences under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974.

50|$|The RI {{value is}} also a {{function}} of the spatial geometry between the observer, light source, and reflector. Figures 1 <b>and</b> 2 show <b>the</b> observation angle <b>and</b> entrance angle between the automobile's headlights, bicycle, <b>and</b> <b>driver.</b> <b>The</b> observation angle is the angle formed by <b>the</b> light beam <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> line of sight. Observation angle is {{a function of the}} distance between <b>the</b> headlights <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> eye, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> distance to the reflector. Traffic engineers use an observation angle of 0.2 degrees to simulate a reflector target about 800 feet in front of a passenger automobile. As the observation angle increases, the reflector performance decreases. For example, a truck has a large separation between <b>the</b> headlight <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> eye compared to a passenger vehicle. A bicycle reflector appears brighter to <b>the</b> passenger car <b>driver</b> than to <b>the</b> truck <b>driver</b> at <b>the</b> same distance from the vehicle to the reflector.|$|R

5|$|There are differing {{levels of}} {{qualification}} that the ambulance crew may hold, from holding no formal qualification to having a fully qualified doctor on board. Most ambulance services require at least two crew members to be on every ambulance (one to drive, and one to attend the patient), although response cars may have a sole crew member, possibly backed up by another double-crewed ambulance. It {{may be the case}} that only the attendant need be qualified, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> might have no medical training. In some locations, an advanced life support ambulance may be crewed by one paramedic and one EMT-Basic.|$|E
5|$|Ambulance Driver – Some {{services}} employ {{staff with}} no medical qualification (or just a first aid certificate) {{whose job is}} to simply drive the patients from place to place. In some emergency ambulance contexts this term is a pejorative toward qualified providers implying that they perform no function but driving, although it may be acceptable for patient transport or community operations. In some areas, these drivers would survey and study the local network of routes for better performance of service, as some road routes may be blocked, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> must know another route to the patient or to the hospital. The driver would gather the local weather and traffic status reports before and in-between emergencies. They may also have training in using the radio and knowing where medical supplies are stored in the ambulance.|$|E

Dexter follows the truck, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> throws a severed head at Dexter's car. When the police squad arrives, LaGuerta confirms that Doakes' case was indeed a crime of passion. Dexter arrives at Rita's apartment, where she expresses interest in taking their relationship to a more intimate level, under the impression that this is what Dexter wants. Dexter feels uncomfortable and is saved when Rita's son, Cody, gets sick next door and needs his mother to pick him up. When Dexter arrives home, he finds a doll's head on his refrigerator door. Inside the freezer, he finds the other parts of the doll, severed just like the bloodless bodies of the dead women. Dexter views the doll as an invitation to play, which he accepts gladly.|$|E
5|$|On 23 November 2003, {{near his}} home in the Warwickshire village of Meriden, West Midlands, Hughes lost control of his Mercedes CL55 AMG and went onto {{the wrong side of the}} road before colliding with a Renault Scénic.

Hughes and passenger Adrian Smith left the scene, before turning themselves in to the police 36 hours later. He was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He denied the charge, though later pleaded guilty to charges of failing to stop and failing to report an accident.|$|E
5|$|On 9 December 2015, the ORR {{announced}} that WCRC <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> {{of the train}} were to be prosecuted for offences contrary to the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974.

When the case opened, neither the driver Melvyn Cox nor WCRC entered pleas. The case was committed to Swindon Crown Court, where it was scheduled to be heard on 19 February; unconditional bail was granted to Cox. The case was subsequently postponed until 18 March, and then further postponed to an undisclosed date in May 2016. In late May, it was {{announced that}} the trial would begin on 27 June 2016.|$|E

5|$|The trams were {{unidirectional}} and had {{a single}} door at the front and a double door in the middle, both on the right side. Class E also had a single door at the rear. The trams were originally delivered with two apartments, with a wall and inside door {{in front of the}} centre door. This was removed after the trams became smoke-free. They had a partial wooden interior, with linoleum floors. Various renovations changed the panelling, usually variations of brown and yellow. The trams originally had incandescent light bulbs, but these were replaced with fluorescent lamps after 1955. From 1970 to 1974, the trams were rebuilt to remove the conductor, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> was given space for a purse and ticket machine, as well as an announcement system. The E-series eventually had the rear door taken out of use and blocked with an extra seat.|$|E
5|$|Timoshenko and his partner, Officer Herman Yan, {{had been}} driving in a marked 71st precinct police car on a routine patrol in Crown Heights, with Timoshenko riding as the {{passenger}} when they spotted a 2003 black BMW sports utility vehicle headed westbound on Lefferts Avenue at 2:30 am. The officers scanned the BMW's license plate on a computer in their police car. When the check came back, it indicated that the plate was assigned to a 2007 Mitsubishi Outlander, not the BMW. Timoshenko and Yan signaled for the vehicle to pull over, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> complied, turning north onto Rogers Avenue, where both officers got out of their car and approached the stopped vehicle.|$|E
5|$|At 3:50 pm {{the prisoners}} left H7, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> and a prison orderly were {{taken back to}} the lorry, and the driver's foot tied to the clutch. 37 prisoners climbed {{into the back of}} the lorry, while Kelly lay on the floor of the cab with a gun pointed at the driver, who was also told the cab had been booby trapped with a hand grenade. At nearly 4:00 pm the lorry drove towards the main gate of the prison, where the prisoners {{intended}} to take over the gatehouse. Ten prisoners dressed in guards' uniforms and armed with guns and chisels dismounted from the lorry and entered the gatehouse, where they took the officers hostage. At 4:05 pm the officers began to resist, and an officer pressed an alarm button. When other staff responded via an intercom, a senior officer said while being held at gunpoint that the alarm had been triggered accidentally. By this time the prisoners were struggling to maintain control in the gatehouse due to the number of hostages. Officers arriving for work were entering the gatehouse from outside the prison, and each was ordered at gunpoint to join the other hostages. Officer James Ferris ran from the gatehouse towards the pedestrian gate attempting to raise the alarm, pursued by Dermot Finucane. Ferris had already been stabbed three times in the chest, and before he could raise the alarm he collapsed.|$|E

5|$|In most cases, {{the owner}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> of the chariot were {{different}} persons. In 416 BC, the Athenian general Alcibiades had seven chariots in the race, {{and came in}} first, second, and fourth; obviously, {{he could not have}} been racing all seven chariots himself. Philip II of Macedon also won an Olympic chariot race in an attempt to prove he was not a barbarian, although if he had driven the chariot himself he would likely have been considered even lower than a barbarian. The poet Pindar did praise the courage of Herodotes of Thebes, however, for driving his own chariot. This rule also meant that women could win the race through ownership, despite the fact that women were not allowed to participate in or even watch the Games. This happened rarely, but a notable example is the Spartan Cynisca, daughter of Archidamus II, who won the chariot race twice. Chariot racing was a way for Greeks to demonstrate their prosperity at the games. The case of Alcibiades indicates also that chariot racing was an alternative route to public exposure and fame for the wealthy.|$|E
5|$|When the glider was {{carrying}} tanks or other vehicles, common practice was that their engines would be {{started in the}} air, usually {{just prior to the}} glider casting off from the tug; special exhaust ducts were fitted to the glider to expel exhaust fumes. The Tetrarch and M22 Locust light tanks were so large that they barely fit inside the glider, and as such their crews stayed inside the tank {{for the duration of the}} flight. Once the glider landed, the anchorages keeping the vehicle stationary would be released by the driver pulling a lanyard within his reach, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> would then drive the tank forward, which automatically pulled a line that operated the swing door release. Universal Carriers and other vehicles relied on one of the pilots operating the door line manually. This was achieved by the pilot sliding down the fuselage and then dropping to the ground. They would then go to each undercarriage leg and release the valves there, which would expel hydraulic fluid and allow the shock absorbers struts to deflate, and then enter the glider and operate the door release line. If the swing door was jammed after the glider had landed, it was possible for tanks to break through the unopened forward fuselage and drive straight out of the glider, which occurred in both airborne operations where Hamilcars transported tanks.|$|E
