The study was conducted with objective to assess the accuracy and reliability of ultrasound estimation of fetal weight in women with a singleton term pregnancy. Materials & Methods: This was a prospective cross-sectional study of 120 women with singleton term pregnancies. Ultrasound estimated fetal weight was calculated by measuring the biparietal diameter and abdominal circumference. The estimated fetal weight was compared to the <b>actual</b> birth <b>weight</b> post delivery. The correlation between estimated fetal <b>weight</b> and <b>actual</b> birth <b>weight</b> was assessed by Pearson's correlation coefficient and the accuracy of sonographic fetal weight estimation was measured using mean error, mean absolute error, mean percentage error, mean absolute percentage error and proportion of estimates within 10 % of <b>actual</b> birth <b>weight.</b> Results were tested at error level set at p ≤ 0. 05. Results: Mean estimated and <b>actual</b> birth <b>weights</b> were 2863. 5 ± 441. 9 g and 2822. 5 ± 407. 7 g respectively. There was a strong positive correlation between estimated fetal <b>weight</b> and <b>actual</b> birth <b>weight</b> (r= 0. 71, p < 0. 001). The mean percentage error and mean absolute percentage error of ultrasound fetal weight estimations were 1. 9 ± 11. 4 % and 8. 8 ± 7. 5 % respectively.

The twenty crossed plants weighed 65 ounces, and twenty self-fertilised (by calculation from the <b>actual</b> <b>weight</b> of the thirty-two self-fertilised plants) weighed 26.25 ounces; or as 100 to 40. Therefore the crossed plants did not exceed in weight the self-fertilised plants in nearly so great a degree as those growing in the pots, owing probably to the latter having been subjected to more severe mutual competition. On the other hand, they exceeded the self-fertilised in height in a slightly greater degree.|$|E
60|$|In {{the early}} part of this chapter it was shown that the {{crossing}} of individuals belonging to distinct families of the same race, or to different races or species, gives increased size and constitutional vigour to the offspring, and, except in the case of crossed species, increased fertility.

The good results of crossing have also been demonstrated with some animals and with numerous plants, by <b>actual</b> <b>weight</b> and measurement. Although animals of pure blood will obviously be deteriorated by crossing, as far as their characteristic qualities are concerned, there seems to be no exception to the rule that advantages of the kind just mentioned are thus gained, even when there has not been any previous close interbreeding; and the rule applies to such animals as cattle and sheep, which can long resist breeding in-and-in between the nearest blood-relations.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to validate the use of flank-to-flank measurement in predicting weight of lactating sows and to determine the accuracy of the developed models in estimating lactation weight change. A total of 70 lactating sows (PIC Line 1050) were used in this study. Flank-to-flank measurement and body weight were measured on each individual sow after farrowing and at weaning. Flank-to-flank measurement and weight of lactating sows was positively correlated (R 2 = 0. 61; P<. 0001) with the following equation: BW 0. 33, kg = 0. 0371 x Flank-to-flank (cm) + 2. 161. Weights of sows post-farrowing and at weaning were lower (P< 0. 03) when predicted with the previous allometric model developed from growing pigs and sows than their <b>actual</b> <b>weights</b> or weights predicted using the lactating sow model. Likewise, absolute residuals for post-farrowing and weaning weights using a previous allometric model developed from growing pigs and gestating sows were greater (P< 0. 02) than those of the lactating sow model. There were no differences (P< 0. 89) between the predicted weights using the lactating sow model and their <b>actual</b> <b>weights.</b> There also were no differences between the <b>actual</b> average <b>weight</b> loss (P< 0. 14) and the predicted loss using the lactating sow model.

In conclusion, flank-to-flank measurement {{can be used as a}} predictor of weight of lactating sows, with the relationship having less accuracy than those used for growing-finishing pigs, gestating sows, and boars.

60|$|With {{respect to}} Tables 8.III.a and b, I may first state that I tested them by taking another {{skeleton}} of a wild duck and of a common domestic duck, and by comparing the weight of ALL {{the bones of the}} leg with ALL those of the wings, and the result was the same. In the first of these tables we see that the leg-bones in each case have increased in <b>actual</b> <b>weight.</b> It might have been expected that, with the increased or decreased weight of the entire skeleton, the leg-bones would have become proportionally heavier or lighter; but their greater weight in all the breeds relatively to the other bones can be accounted for only by these domestic birds having used their legs in walking and standing much more than the wild, for they never fly, and the more artificial breeds rarely swim. In the second table we see, {{with the exception of one}} case, a plain reduction in the weight of the bones of the wing, and this no doubt has resulted from their lessened use. The one exceptional case, namely, in one of the Call ducks, is in truth no exception, for this bird was constantly in the habit of flying about; and I have seen it day after day rise from my grounds, and fly for a long time in circles of more than a mile in diameter. In this Call duck there is not only no decrease, but an actual increase in the weight of the wing-bones relatively to those of the wild-duck; and this probably is consequent on the remarkable lightness and thinness of all the bones of the skeleton.|$|E
60|$|While taking bats {{one day in}} December, I {{captured}} a female of our common Buenos Ayrean species (Molossus bonariensis), with her two young attached to her, so large that it seemed incredible she {{should be able to}} fly and take insects with such a weight to drag her down. The young were about a third less in size than the mother, so that she had to carry a weight greatly exceeding that of her own body. They were fastened to her breast and belly, one on each side, as when first born; and, possibly, the young bat does not change its position, or move, like the young developed opossum, {{to other parts of the}} body, until mature enough to begin an independent life. On forcibly separating them from their parent, I found that they were not yet able to fly, but when set free fluttered feebly to the ground. This bat certainly appeared more burdened with its young than any animal I had ever observed. I have seen an old female opossum (Didelphys azarae) with eleven young, large as old rats--the mother being less than a cat in size--all clinging to various parts of her body; yet able to climb swiftly and with the greatest agility in the higher branches of a tree. The <b>actual</b> <b>weight</b> was in this case relatively much greater than in that of the female bat: but then the opossum never quitted its hold on the tree, and it also supplemented its hand-like feet, furnished with crooked claws, with its teeth and long prehensile tail. The poor bat had to seek its living in the empty air, pursuing its prey with the swiftness of a swallow, and it seemed wonderful to me that she should have been able to carry about that great burden with her one pair of wings, and withal to be active enough to supply herself and her young with food.|$|E

A predictive PDF model is then constructed, based on which predictive control algorithms are established with the purpose to drive the output PDF towards the desired target PDF over the control process. An analytical solution is obtained for the non-constrained predictive PDF control. For the constrained predictive control, the optimal solution is achieved via solving a constrained nonlinear optimization problem. The integrated method of data-based modeling and predictive PDF control is applied to closed-loop control of molecular weight distribution (MWD) in an exemplar styrene polymerization process, through which the modeling efficiency and the merits of predictive control over standard PDF control are demonstrated and discussed...|$|R
