5|$|The half-lives of {{mendelevium}} isotopes mostly increase smoothly from 245Md onwards, {{reaching a}} maximum at 258Md.

5|$|Part II was {{released}} on November 22, 1989, to similar financial and critical success as the original, finishing as the third highest-grossing film of the year worldwide. The film continues directly from the ending of Back to the Future and follows Marty and Doc as they travel into the future of 2015, an alternative 1985, and 1955 where Marty must repair the future while avoiding his past self from the original film. Part II became notable for its 2015 setting <b>and</b> <b>predictions</b> of technology such as hoverboards. Part III, released on May 25, 1990, continued the story, following Marty as he travels back to 1885 to rescue a time-stranded Doc.|$|E

40|$|The {{brain as}} a {{proactive}} system processes sensory information under the top-down influence of attention <b>and</b> <b>prediction.</b> However, {{the relation between}} attention <b>and</b> <b>prediction</b> remains undetermined given the conflation of these two mechanisms in the literature. To evaluate whether attention <b>and</b> <b>prediction</b> are dependent of each other, and if so, how these two top-down mechanisms may interact in sensory processing, we orthogonally manipulated attention <b>and</b> <b>prediction</b> in a target detection task. Participants were instructed {{to pay attention to}} one of two interleaved stimulus streams of predictable/unpredictable tone frequency. We found that attention <b>and</b> <b>prediction</b> interacted on the amplitude of the N 1 ERP component. The N 1 amplitude in the attended/predictable condition was larger than that in any of the other conditions. Dipole source localisation analysis showed that the effect came from the activation in bilateral auditory areas. No significant effect was found in the P 2 time window. Our results suggest that attention <b>and</b> <b>prediction</b> are dependent of each other. While attention might determine the overall cortical responsiveness to stimuli when prediction is involved, prediction might provide an anchor for the modulation of the synaptic input strengths which needs to be operated on the basis of attention...|$|R

Different kinds of experiments are conducted and summarized to identify various problems in existing computer network applications. Network traffic analysis <b>and</b> <b>prediction</b> is a proactive approach to ensure secure, reliable and qualitative network communication. Various techniques are proposed and experimented for analyzing network traffic including neural network based techniques to data mining techniques.

One phenomenon, {{which seems to be}} a reliable precursor to eruptive activity, is a low-frequency seismic event known as a tornillo event.

25|$|For their part, Frankfurt School theorists quickly came {{to realize}} that a dialectical method could only be adopted if it could be applied to itself—that is to say, if they adopted a self-correcting method—a dialectical method that would enable them to correct {{previous}} false dialectical interpretations. Accordingly, critical theory rejected the historicism and materialism of orthodox Marxism. Indeed, the material tensions and class struggles of which Marx spoke were no longer seen by Frankfurt School theorists as having the same revolutionary potential within contemporary Western societies—an observation that indicated that Marx's dialectical interpretations <b>and</b> <b>predictions</b> were either incomplete or incorrect.|$|E

The change from circular orbits to elliptical planetary paths dramatically improved the accuracy of celestial observations <b>and</b> <b>predictions.</b> Because the heliocentric model by Copernicus was no more accurate than Ptolemy's system, new observations were needed to persuade those who still held on to the geocentric model. However, Kepler's laws based on Brahe's data became a problem which geocentrists could not easily overcome.|$|E
