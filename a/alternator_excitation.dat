40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} implementation of automatic paralleling of synchronous generator system using LabVIEW platform. The system comprises of the hardware and the software parts. The hardware part encapsulates the prime mover, synchronous <b>alternator,</b> <b>excitation</b> unit and other sundries that constitute a synchronous generator system. The software part comprises of the National Instruments LabVIEW software, PCI- 6014 Data Acquisition card, and the NI ELVIS devices. The overall system architecture is simple and cheap to implement and is recommended for paralleling of small synchronous generators (SSG) in the mission field of military establishment...|$|E
40|$|A {{power system}} {{stabilizer}} (PSS) {{installed in the}} excitation system of the synchronous generator improves the small-signal power system stability by damping out low frequency oscillations in the power system. It does that by providing supplementary perturbation signals in a feedback path to the <b>alternator</b> <b>excitation</b> system. In our project we review different conventional PSS design (CPSS) techniques along with modern adaptive neuro-fuzzy design techniques. We adapt a linearized single-machine infinite bus model for design and simulation of the CPSS and the voltage regulator (AVR). We use 3 different input signals in the feedback (PSS) path namely, speed variation(w), Electrical Power (Pe), and integral of accelerating power (Pe*w), and review the results in each case. For simulations, we use three different linear design techniques, namely, root-locus design, frequency-response design, and pole placement design; and the preferred non-linear design technique is the adaptive neuro-fuzzy based controller design. The MATLAB package with Control System Toolbox and SIMULINK {{is used for the}} design and simulations. ...|$|E
50|$|All of this {{drove the}} wheels of the turbine, which then, through a gear, made the {{alternator}} turn, which produced electric power to distribute to consumers and to be used by the power station’s own electric equipment. The star-wound alternator produced a triphasic current of 10.500V with a frequency of 50 cycles per second (cps). The <b>alternator’s</b> <b>excitation</b> current was supplied by the exciter, a continuous current generator joined directly to the general base that, at full charge, had 170 Volts CC with a 340 Amp intensity.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) {{is widely}} used in {{industrial}} application to obtain the stability and good regulation of different electrical apparatus. In order to get output of the <b>alternator,</b> the field <b>excitation</b> {{is controlled by the}} AVR. The AVR maintains the constant voltage up to certain level of the load current which is independent of the generator speed and load. In this paper, the excitation control for the synchronous generator is designed by using silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) in order to improve the overall effectiveness of the synchronous generator. The control strategy is aimed to generate and deliver power to the interconnected system economically and reliably while managing the voltage and field current within set limitations. This includes a more accurate measurement of voltage and current, as well as improving the response time and system stability...|$|R
50|$|Alternators {{have several}} {{advantages}} over direct-current generators. They are lighter, cheaper and more rugged. They use slip rings providing greatly extended brush life over a commutator. The brushes in an <b>alternator</b> carry only <b>excitation</b> current, {{a small fraction}} of the current carried by the brushes of a DC generator, which carry the generator's entire output. A set of rectifiers (diode bridge) is required to convert AC to DC. To provide direct current with low ripple, a three-phase winding is used and the pole-pieces of the rotor are shaped (claw-pole) to produce a waveform similar to a square wave instead of a sinusoid. Automotive alternators are usually belt-driven at 2-3 times crankshaft speed. The alternator runs at various RPM (which varies the frequency) since it is driven by the engine. This is not a problem because the alternating current is rectified to direct current.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Diesel-electric {{stations}} have some advantages over {{other types of}} station, particularly in comparatively small sizes. A diesel station can be started and stopped quickly as and when required. It does not need any warming period, and need not be kept running {{for a long time}} before picking up load. There are thus no standby losses as in steam stations [...] A diesel station does not need a large amount of water for cooling. For this station,, synchronous generator is used to generate electricity. This paper presents the excitation control system in generator operation. The topic of this paper involves the design and construction of excitation control (or) Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) for the synchronous generator. It is necessary to develop the electronic control system for the machine. The Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) is widely used in electrical power field to obtain the stability and good regulation of the electric system. The characteristics of alternator output required are constant voltage and constant current. To get the constant output, <b>alternator</b> field <b>excitation</b> is controlled by Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR). The Automatic Voltage Regulator maintains the constant voltage up to certain level of load current independently of generator speed and load. This paper deals with the design and construction of excitation control for synchronous generator and introduces the electronic control technology. The main objective of this paper is to modify the AVR with SCR device technology. On completion of this paper, the constructed circuit will improve the overall effectiveness of the synchronous generator. This includes a more accurate measurement of voltage and current, as well as improving the response time and system stability...|$|R
