5|$|Mohini plays {{a lesser}} {{role in a}} Shaiva legend in the Skanda Purana. Here, Vishnu as Mohini joins Shiva to teach <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>to</b> arrogant sages. A group of sages are {{performing}} rituals in a forest, and start to consider themselves as gods. To humble them, Shiva {{takes the form of}} an attractive young beggar (Bhikshatana) and Vishnu becomes Mohini, his wife. While the sages fall for Mohini, their women wildly chase Shiva. When they regain their senses, they perform a black magic sacrifice, which produces a serpent, a lion, an elephant (or tiger) and a dwarf, all of which are overpowered by Shiva. Shiva then dances on the dwarf and takes the form of Nataraja, the cosmic dancer. The legend is retold in the Tamil Kovil Puranam and Kandha Puranam with some variation. This legend is also told in the Sthala Purana related to the Chidambaram Temple dedicated to Shiva-Nataraja.|$|E
5|$|After {{handing over}} the {{earrings}} and taking leave of his guru, Uttanka went to Hastinapur, {{the kingdom of}} King Janamejaya. He resolved to teach <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>to</b> Takshaka who had caused him trouble. He informed Janamejaya that it was Takshaka who had killed his father Parikshit and advised Janamejaya to perform a snake sacrifice to exterminate the serpents. Uttanka {{was one of the}} rishis who participated in the Sarpa Satra yagna initiated by the king. Sarpa Satra was meant to draw all serpents to the sacrificial fire to certain death by the chanting of mantras. After the serpents started falling into the sacrificial fire, Takshaka was not to be found anywhere. Uttanka then recited the mantras with great vigour to draw Takshaka to the fire. In mortal fear, Taskshaka took shelter with Indra and got himself tied to the throne of Indra for protection. Uttanka, who realised that Takshaka had taken refuge with Indra, intensified his mantras to ensure that not only Takshaka but also Indra along with his throne were drawn to the fire. Indra freed the snake from the throne and escaped. However, when Takshaka was about to drop to death into the sacrificial fire, Astika, a young boy well versed in scriptures, son of the sage Jaratkaru intervened with Janamejaya. Astika ensured that the Sarpa Satra was stopped and the life of Takshaka was saved.|$|E

25|$|A Thomas Reuters Foundation survey {{says that}} India {{is the fourth}} most {{dangerous}} {{place in the world}} for women to live in.

In India, acid attacks on women who dared to refuse a man's proposal of marriage or asked for a divorce are a form of revenge. Acid is cheap, easily available, and the quickest way to destroy a woman's life. The number of acid attacks have been rising.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after, two Datus from Aklan and Ibajay {{presented}} {{themselves to}} Legaspi and {{complained about the}} violence and outrages that the inhabitants of Mindoro, who were given to piracy, had caused upon their territories. Having assumed the responsibility to put his allies under his protection, the Spanish conquistador dispatched a group of his soldiers {{under the command of}} his grandson Don Juan de Salcedo, who sailed twenty leagues northward together with five hundred selected local warriors, in order to give <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>to</b> the pirates of Mindoro. He sought to land by night, cancelling his ships from the enemies' sight and, under the guide of a Datu of Panay who knows the way to the village of the pirates, he diligently maneuvered a surprise attack bringing along only two hundred native warriors. The siege was met with a vigorous resistance, but many inhabitants of Mindoro fell under Salcedo's hands. To those who survived the attack and lived, he granted liberty, after they paid a certain amount of gold. He chased others who were able to escape, as far as Lubang Island.|$|E
500|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{suggests that}} the Kaumodaki symbolizes the life-force (prana) from which all [...] "physical and mental powers" [...] arise. Vishnu's gada also stands for discipline, complemented by his lotus, that denotes praise. While the lotus and shankha in his hands are water symbols representing life and love, the gada and the chakra are fire symbols denoting pain and destruction and command adherence {{to the rules of}} society and nature. The Varaha Purana says the gada is to teach <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>to</b> irreligious rulers. Vishnu is also said to clear illusion by his gada.|$|E

500|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} on systems including dual-processor Pentium Pro 200s and Athlon 800s with eight and nine gigabyte hard drives, some using SCSI. The team used [...] "more than 100 video cards" [...] throughout development. Deus Ex was built using Visual Studio, Lightwave, and Lotus Notes. They also built a custom dialogue editor, ConEdit. The team used UnrealEd atop the Unreal game engine for map design, which Spector wrote was [...] "superior {{to anything else}} available". Their trust in UnrealScript led them to code [...] "special-cases" [...] for their immediate mission needs instead of more generalized multi-case code. Even as concerned team members expressed misgivings, the team only addressed this later in the project. To Spector, this was <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>to</b> always prefer [...] "general solutions" [...] over [...] "special casing", such that the tool set works predictably.|$|E

500|$|Sean Connery and John Huston were {{considered}} for the other roles.

[...] Jones was an award-winning veteran of numerous theater and cinema productions. Von Sydow was a Swedish actor of international renown. [...] The role of Thulsa Doom was offered to Jones while he was considering applying for the role of Grendel in an upcoming feature based on John Gardner's eponymous novel; after learning it was an animation, Jones read Conans script and accepted the part of Doom. When filming started, Jones was also starring in a Broadway play - Athol Fugard's <b>A</b> <b>Lesson</b> <b>to</b> Aloes.

500|$|In 2011, Kapoor {{starred in}} Thank You, a comedy about three women who teach <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>to</b> their philandering husbands. The film, along with Kapoor's performance, {{received}} poor reviews; Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India called her [...] "terribly out of sync". She then played the romantic interest of Shahid Kapoor in the Pankaj Kapur-directed romantic drama, Mausam, {{which was also}} poorly received. Despite doubts about her acting ability, critic Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV thought Kapoor conveyed [...] "the essential vulnerability of a girl forever under duress, bringing out just {{the right mix of}} feminine fragility and native resolve". The following year, Kapoor played a computer hacker opposite Abhishek Bachchan and Bipasha Basu in the Abbas–Mustan-directed action film, Players, a remake of 2003's The Italian Job. Her role was originally written for Katrina Kaif, who was unavailable for the film. Although journalists had high expectations, it failed commercially, and Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com remarked derogatively that Kapoor [...] "truly entertains with her childish attempt to pass off as a Gold-medalist hacker".|$|E

LaRue Cook of Entertainment Weekly graded the film with a [...] "D" [...] and wrote, [...] "what {{was once a}} fresh slice of teen comedy has become a slab of stale crudeness." [...] Scott Weinberg of Moviefone, in his negative review, found the film [...] "slightly more amusing to sit through than the two previous entries", in particular praising the Star Trek sexual roleplay scene as [...] "extremely effective." [...] DVD Talk's Jeffrey Robinson writes that [...] "if anything, it will bore you and leave you wondering why you wasted {{an hour and a}} half of your life." [...] Writing in JoBlo.com, Adam Quigley poked fun at the film's themes, declaring that [...] "if there's <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>to</b> be taken from these films, it's that women are objects, and should always be treated as such." [...] IGNs Hock Teh gave the film 5/10, writing that it [...] "stays very close to the American Pie formula," [...] while criticizing the story as [...] "devoid of anything remotely semi-compelling or even noteworthy." [...] Peter Hammond of Maxim describes American Pie Presents: Beta House as [...] "loaded with sex, laughs and raunchy fun," [...] writing that it [...] "may be the most outrageous slice of pie yet!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{only known}} {{credit for the}} film is that it starred William Garwood. Film historian, Q. David Bowers notes that the plot dealing with circumstantial {{evidence}} focused on one of Lloyd Lonergan's social issues. Lonergan would produce several scenarios featuring the problems with circumstantial evidence being used to obtain convictions. Bowers notes that such convictions were a known social issue, but not a pressing one in 1911. The first such Thanhouser film to tackle the subject was Love and Law released in December 1910. Love and Law was a film which garnered some criticism for an improbable plot. Checkmate wove a more tangled web of circumstantial evidence and intrigue and the resolution comes not from an astute female detective, but by the heiress's novel substitution of a doppelgänger to the prison so that the original can get the needed confession. The serious nature of the film was highlighted with the advertising of the film by Thanhouser which states, [...] "Checkmate carries a message and <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>to</b> those who value the 'circumstantial evidence' process by which so many convictions are obtained in our criminal courts. The reel demonstrates how easily evidence of this sort may be made to entangle and ensnare a totally innocent man..." ...|$|E
500|$|Caligari was a {{critical}} success in France, but French filmmakers were divided in their opinions after its release. Abel Gance called it [...] "superb" [...] and wrote, [...] "What <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>to</b> all directors!" [...] and René Clair said [...] "overthrew the realist dogma" [...] of filmmaking. Film critic and director Louis Delluc said the film has a compelling rhythm: [...] "At first slow, deliberately laborious, it attempts to irritate. Then when the zigzag motifs of the fairground start turning, the pace leaps forward, agitato, accelerando, and leaves off only at the word 'End', as abruptly as {{a slap in the}} face." [...] Jean Epstein, however, called it [...] "a prize example of the abuse of décor in the cinema" [...] and said it [...] "represents a grave sickness of cinema". Likewise, Jean Cocteau called it [...] "the first step towards a grave error which consists of flat photography of eccentric decors, instead of obtaining surprise by means of the camera". [...] French critic Frédéric-Philippe Amiguet wrote of the film: [...] "It has the odor of tainted food. It leaves a taste of cinders in the mouth." [...] The Russian director Sergei Eisenstein especially disliked Caligari, calling it a [...] "combination of silent hysteria, partially coloured canvases, daubed flats, painted faces, and the unnatural broken gestures and action of monstrous chimaeras".|$|E
