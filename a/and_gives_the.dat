5|$|A better {{approximation}} {{is to take}} ε = L/M, {{the energy}} generation rate per unit mass, as ε is proportional to TI15, where TI is the core temperature. This is suitable for stars at least as massive as the Sun, exhibiting the CNO cycle, <b>and</b> <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> better fit R ∝ M0.78.|$|E
5|$|A {{vanadium}} nitrogenase {{is used by}} some nitrogen-fixing micro-organisms, such as Azotobacter. In this role, vanadium replaces {{more common}} molybdenum or iron, <b>and</b> <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> nitrogenase slightly different properties.|$|E

Examples are SN 2002ic and SN 2005gj. These supernova have been dubbed Type Ia/IIn, Type Ian, Type IIa and Type IIan.|$|E
5|$|A corrupt {{political}} leader named Chedi Singh (Sonu Sood) meets Chulbul and both quickly become enemies. Makkhi asks {{his father to}} arrange his marriage with Nirmala. His father refuses because he needs money to repay the loans he took to make his factory, and he believes that he can acquire money through his son marrying a rich girl. In desperate need of money, Makkhi steals from Chulbul's cupboard <b>and</b> <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> stolen cash to Nirmala's father, hoping that he will permit Makkhi to marry Nirmala. Meanwhile, Chulbul meets Rajjo and proposes marriage, which she rejects, as she has {{to take care of}} her father, Haria (Mahesh Manjrekar)—a drunkard.|$|E
5|$|After DNA damage, {{cell cycle}} checkpoints are activated. Checkpoint {{activation}} pauses the cell cycle <b>and</b> <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> cell time {{to repair the}} damage before continuing to divide. DNA damage checkpoints occur at the G1/S and G2/M boundaries. An intra-S checkpoint also exists. Checkpoint activation is controlled by two master kinases, ATM and ATR. ATM responds to DNA double-strand breaks and disruptions in chromatin structure, whereas ATR primarily responds to stalled replication forks. These kinases phosphorylate downstream targets in a signal transduction cascade, eventually leading to cell cycle arrest. A class of checkpoint mediator proteins including BRCA1, MDC1, and 53BP1 has also been identified. These proteins seem to be required for transmitting the checkpoint activation signal to downstream proteins.|$|E

5|$|Cannon {{recovered}} from the sea are often extensively damaged from exposure to salt water; because of this, electrolytic reduction treatment is required to forestall the process of corrosion. The cannon is then washed in deionized water to remove the electrolyte, and is treated in tannic acid, which prevents further rust <b>and</b> <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> metal a bluish-black colour. After this process, cannons on display may be protected from oxygen and moisture by a wax sealant. A coat of polyurethane may also be painted over the wax sealant, to prevent the wax-coated cannon from attracting dust in outdoor displays.|$|E
5|$|In the aftermath, Quill tricks Yondu {{into taking}} a {{container}} supposedly containing the Stone, <b>and</b> <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> real Stone to the Nova Corps. As the Ravagers leave Xandar, Yondu remarks that {{it turned out}} well {{that they did not}} deliver Quill to his father per their contract. Quill's group, now known as the Guardians of the Galaxy, have their criminal records expunged, and Quill learns that he is only half-human, his father being part of an ancient, unknown species. Quill finally opens the last present he received from his mother: a cassette tape filled with her favorite songs. The Guardians leave in the rebuilt Milano along with a sapling cut from Groot.|$|E
5|$|Octopus blood {{contains}} the copper-rich protein haemocyanin to transport oxygen. This makes the blood very viscous {{and it requires}} considerable pressure to pump it round the body; octopuses' blood pressures can exceed 75 mmHg. In cold conditions with low oxygen levels, haemocyanin transports oxygen more efficiently than haemoglobin. The haemocyanin is dissolved in the plasma instead of being carried within blood cells, <b>and</b> <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> blood a bluish colour.|$|E

5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} L.incarnatum are tiny, oval to roughly spherical, and measure 35–1250 by 200–450μm. The {{floating}} balls are sometimes enclosed {{in a loose}} subiculum, with a whitish surface that is byssoid (consisting of fine threads). The peridium (the outer protective tissue layer) is 18–30μm thick, byssoid, and made of clamped hyphae typically 2.5–4μm in diameter intertwined with dendrophyses (irregularly branched cystidia) 1μm in diameter. The surface of the peridium is hydrophobic, a feature that helps keep water off the growing hymenium during its development, <b>and</b> <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> fruit body buoyancy.|$|E

5|$|The {{summit of}} Mauna Kea lies above the tree line, and {{consists}} of mostly lava rock and alpine tundra. An area of heavy snowfall, it is inhospitable to vegetation, and {{is known as the}} Hawaiian tropical high shrublands. Growth is restricted here by extremely cold temperatures, a short growing season, low rainfall, and snow during winter months. A lack of soil also retards root growth, makes it difficult to absorb nutrients from the ground, <b>and</b> <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> area a very low water retention capacity.|$|E
5|$|Two large tomb stelae made {{of granite}} {{were found at}} his burial site. Their shape is unusual and they appear {{unfinished}} and rough. Egyptologists suspect that this was done deliberately, but the reasons are unknown. A cylinder seal of unknown provenance shows Peribsen's name inside a cartouche <b>and</b> <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> epithet Merj-netjeru ("beloved of the gods"). This arrangement leads Egyptologists and archaeologists {{to the conclusion that}} the seal must have been created later, in memoriam, because the use of royal cartouches began long after Peribsen's reign. Another seal of the same material shows Peribsen's name without a cartouche, but with the royal title Nisut-Bity ("king of Lower- and Upper Egypt") instead.|$|E
5|$|Nafaryus hears a rumor about Gabriel {{being the}} savior of the people. He and his family travel to Ravenskill to see him for {{themselves}} ("Lord Nafaryus"). In the Ravenskill town square, Gabriel is performing for the people when the royal family shows up. He continues playing at the emperor's request ("A Savior in the Square"), nearly bringing them all to tears ("When Your Time Has Come"). As he plays, Faythe remembers how she found a music player {{when she was a}} child and kept it a secret all her life, and as she and Gabriel stare at each other and fall in love ("Act of Faythe"). Nafaryus, though briefly moved by Gabriel's song, sees him as a threat to his rule <b>and</b> <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> people of the town three days to deliver their savior to him or he will destroy the town ("Three Days").
