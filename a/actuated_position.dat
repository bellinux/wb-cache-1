40|$|Abstract—MEMS {{phase shifter}} has been {{developed}} using inductors. The design consists of a CPW line capacitively and inductively loaded by the periodic set of inductors and electrostatic force actuated MEMS switches as capacitors. By applying a single bias voltage on the line, the characteristic impedance can be changed,which in turn changes the phase velocity {{of the line and}} creates a true time delay phase shift. The governing equations for the impedance and loss are derived. The ABCD matrix is defined for a unit cell and multi-cell DMTL phase shifter to extract scattering parameters equations. The MEMS switch is actuated by a 39 voltage waveform using a high resistance bias line. Estimated spring constant and switching time is 22 N/m and 3 µs,respectively. The structure is designed for Ka-band frequency range. The acceptable frequency range for the design containing 21 cells is between 26 GHz and 27 GHz and optimum condition occurs at 26. 3 GHz. For the whole structure and optimum condition the un <b>actuated</b> <b>position</b> results in a return loss − 16 dB and insertion loss of − 1. 65 dB. The <b>actuated</b> <b>position</b> results in a return loss − 12. 5 dB and insertion loss of − 1. 6 dB. The phase shift for the whole structure is 190 degree.

On the other hand, the reliability of such a technology {{still has to be}} fully addressed in order to enable a successful penetration of RF-MEMS technology into the market. Reliability of MEMS/RF-MEMS involves several physical phenomena that can jeopardize their normal operation as well as the stability of their characteristic vs. time. Among such different effects, the authors believe {{that one of the most}} important source of malfunctioning is the stiction (i. e. the switch remains stuck in the <b>actuated</b> <b>position</b> when the controlling bias is removed) due to the charge entrapment into the insulator layer and/or the formation of micro-welding.

40|$|The Department of Mechanical Engineering of the University of Leuven {{started its}} {{research}} on piezoelectrically <b>actuated</b> <b>positioning</b> {{systems in the}} middle of the 90 ’s. This continuous effort resulted in the development of the linear Leuven piezomotor and a novel modeling approach to predict the dynamics and wear behavior of ultrasonic motors. Both were presented at IWPMA 2008. The unique stator design of the Leuven motor offers two main operational modes: a resonant (ultrasonic) mode and a direct mode. The resonant mode offers a wide speed range (100 mm/s) and sub-micron accuracy over a large stroke. The direct mode offers (sub-) nanometer resolution within a stroke of several micrometers. Additionally, a traditional stick-slip mode can be used. As such, the Leuven motor can be regarded as an all-in-one small-size coarse/fine positioning device. The motor can also be used in rotational applications. Current work focuses on further exploring the performance limits of the Leuven motor in linear configurations, and increasing robustness (both mechanically and electrically).

40|$|This MA thesis {{analyzes}} how {{the protagonists}} and the narrative structure relates to “the Child” as a linguistic/cultural construction in Mare Kandre’s early authorship (1984 - 1991). A thematic of children portraits defines {{this period of}} Kandre’s writing, which consits of the following works: In a Different Country (1984), The Annunciation (1986), Bübin’s Kid (1987), The Burning Tree (1988) and Aliide, Aliide (1991). Linguistic components, such as the word “child”, the name “Kid” and a reconstruction {{of the concept of}} childhood, holds an <b>actuate</b> <b>position</b> in these narratives when they first appear in direct relation to the protagonists. This suggests how generally accepted categories and concepts consciously are at work in Kandre’s writings. Consequently, a category such as “child” can not unproblematically serve as a definition of any of the protagonists, irrespective of their presumptive age. Combining philosopher Judith Butler’s theory of name-calling with theories in the field of Childhood Studies as presented by Susan Honeyman, “the Child” in Kandre’s works is explored through the hypothesis of its function as a name. Close readings reveal how the protagonists, in the encounter with an explicitly cultural or narrative context, are constituted as subjects through the linguistic category “child”. The protagonists can be considered both as subordinated by the conventionally manifested notion of life development as a linear, measurable progress and as introduced to the means which make possible a critical response to that same notion. Since the main protagonists strongly refuse to be defined by the conventions supporting “the Child” as a category, a dialogue is created which gives the narrative its force. That dialogue corresponds to different aspects of the concept of childhood, which place “the Child” as a construction at the heart of Kandre’s narrative composition...|$|R

This nano-positioner is designed to be able to accurately and repeatable provide precise motion control of small objects with a resolution on the nanometer scale. This device uses a novel monolithic flexure (Hexflex) that enables it be repeatable to a few nanometers and also very inexpensive to manufacture. The reluctance actuator will provide the force necessary to <b>actuate</b> the <b>positioning</b> system. This actuator type was compared to other actuator types to verify its feasibility and relevance for this application. The actuator operates based off of the reluctance principle used in magnetic circuits and its application as a two-axis actuator is a new and unexplored technology.

Several design iterations were conducted yielding valuable design, manufacturing, and assembly knowledge and insight. Ultimately the actuator did not function properly and consequently did not meet the performance criterion necessary to be incorporated into the nanopositioner system. Due to a correlation disparity between the governing model and the manufactured device, the actuator did not function as predicted and was unusable. Furthermore, after efforts to remedy the problems, the conclusion was reached that the necessary changes would result in the use of this actuator being unfeasible for this application.

40|$|A {{tactile display}} device {{utilizes}} an electrorheological fluid to activate {{a plurality of}} tactile dots. A voltage is selectively produced uniformly across an electrorheological fluid flowing between a common ground electrode and a plurality of conductive dot electrodes, thereby producing {{an increase in the}} fluid's viscosity to the extent that fluid flow between the two electrodes is restricted. The flow restriction produces a build-up of electrorheological fluid in a corresponding dot actuator chamber.

40|$|This is a {{compilation}} thesis which investigates various mechanical phenomena in different low-dimensional nanoscale systems. In the first part, we consider a purely mechanical phenomenon: {{the sensitivity of}} the dispersion of a Love-type surface acoustic wave (SAW) to geometry and material parameters. We model a SAW sensor as a three-layer system with elastic, viscous, or viscoelastic layers. We find that viscoelasticity can remove the support for Love waves. We also derive analytic expressions for the wave velocity and attenuation in the limit of a thin middle layer. In the second part, we consider the interaction of SAWs with an electronic subsystem. We model a flat semi-infinite graphene sheet using 2 D elasticity theory and consider Rayleigh-type SAWs. We investigate the resonant interaction of such SAWs with electronic edge states induced by a transverse magnetic field. When electronic relaxation is much faster than phonon absorption, we find that the SAWs attenuate. In the opposite limit, we show that nonlinear effects can lead to the formation of hypersonic solitons. In the third part, we demonstrate how interaction with an electronic subsystem can actuate nanomechanical vibrations. We study two different systems composed of a movable quantum dot (QD) in position dependent tunneling contact with two leads. In the first system, the leads are held at different temperatures and a spin-valve effect prevents electron exchange between them. We show that electron-electron interaction can mediate a heat flow which can <b>actuate</b> the QD <b>position</b> via a capacitive coupling. In the second system, both the leads and the QD are superconducting and the system has mirror symmetry.

Gao and Jones have developed a discrete control system model for a transverse grinding process. Not many researchers have investigated a discrete control system model for the surface grinding process. The model for the surface grinding process is presented and {{it is based on}} the physical laws associated with the process together with mathematical equations describing the workpiece surface form error profile and flatness error. The system variables for the surface grinding control include required size reduction, nominal wheel infeed, nominal accumulated wheel infeed, wheel infeed position, and flatness error. Based on the model, the workpiece flatness error decreases when the grinding pass number increases. The reduction of flatness error through form error control should be fully investigated after establishing a model for the discrete control system. In surface grinding, a high speed workpiece table motion is involved. In {{order to achieve}} active form error control for improving the machining accuracy, the control commands will include a substantial amount of high frequency signals that may not be sufficiently implemented by a wheel infeed system. A micro positioning system was designed as an additional unit for providing fast control actions. A composite control scheme was proposed for combining both systems. Models of the discrete control system for the surface grinding process controlled by the micro <b>positioning</b> <b>actuating</b> system, the wheel infeed system, and the composite control were established. The methods which reduce the flatness error effectively were identified. For micro positioning systems with a piezoelectric actuator used for dynamic active surface grinding control, sinusoidal excitation at a high frequency would be used and would give additional problems in comparison with the commonly used step signals due to the hysteresis effects of the actuator, which require a good modeling approach.

40|$|A coupled Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) and Computational Structural Dynamics (CSD) {{methodology}} {{is extended}} {{to analyze the}} effectiveness of a leading edge slat (LE-Slat) for mitigating the adverse effects of dynamic stall on rotor blade aerodynamic and dynamic response. This involved the following improvements over the existing CFD methodology to handle a multi-element airfoil rotor: incorporating the so-called Implicit Hole Cutting method for inter-mesh connectivity, implementing a generalized force transfer routine for transferring LE-Slat loads onto the main blade, and achieving increased parallelization of the code. Initially, the structured overset mesh CFD solver is extensively validated against available 2 -D experimental wind tunnel test cases in steady and unsteady flight conditions. The solver predicts the measurements with sufficient accuracy for test cases with both the baseline airfoil and that with two slat configurations, S- 1 and S- 6. As expected, the addition of the slat is found to be highly effective in delaying stall until larger angles for the case of a static airfoil and ameliorating the effects of dynamic stall for a 2 -D pitching airfoil. The 3 -D coupled CFD/CSD model is extensively validated against flight test data of a UH- 60 A rotor in a high-altitude, high-thrust flight condition, namely C 9017, characterized by distinct dynamic stall events in the retreating side of the rotor disk. The validated rotor analysis tool is then used to successfully demonstrate {{the effectiveness of a}} LE-Slat in mitigating (or eliminating) dynamic stall on the rotor retreating side. The calculations are performed with a modified UH- 60 A blade with a 40 %-span slatted airfoil section. The addition of the slat is effective in the mitigation (and/or elimination) of lift and moment stall at outboard stations, which in turn is accompanied by a reduction of torsional structural loads (upto 73 %) and pitch link loads (upto 62 %) as compared to the baseline C 9017 values. The effect of a dynamically moving slat, <b>actuating</b> between slat <b>positions</b> S- 1 and S- 6, is thoroughly investigated, firstly on 2 -D airfoil dynamic stall, and then on the UH- 60 A rotor. Three slat actuation strategies with upto [1, 3, 5]/rev harmonics, respectively, are considered. However, it is noted that the dynamic slat does not necessarily result in better rotor performance as compared to a static slat configuration. The coupled CFD/CSD platform is further used to successfully demonstrate the capability of the slat (S- 6) to achieve upto 10 % higher thrust than C 9017, which is beyond the conventional thrust limit imposed by McHugh's stall boundary. Stall mitigation due to the slat results in a reduction of torsional load upto 54 % and reduction of pitch link load upto 32 % as compared to the baseline C 9017 flight test values, even for an increase in thrust of 10 %...|$|R

Typical maintenance operations such tension measurements, internal stress checking or monitoring of crack development are not practical due to cost and time constrains. Although failure of a single non-critical fastener is not a significant threat to the structure 2 ̆ 7 s stability, massive malfunction may cause structural problem such as insufficient stiffness or excessive vibrations. The health of bolted joints is defined by a single parameter: the clamping force (CF). The CF is the force that holds the elements of the joint together. If the CF is too low, separation and bolt fatigue may occur. On the other hand, excessive CF may produce damages in the structural members such as excessive distortion or breakage. The CF is generated by the superposition of the individual tension of the bolts. The bolt tension, also referred as bolt preload, is the actual force that is stretching the bolt body. Maintaining the appropriate tension in bolts ensures a proper CF and hence a good health of the joint. In this thesis, a novel methodology for estimating the tension in bolts using surface acoustic waves (SAWs) is investigated. The tension is estimated by using the reflection of SAWs created by the bolt head interference. Increments in the bolt tension raise the points of interaction between the waves and the bolt head (real area of contact), and hence the position of the reflective boundaries. The variations are estimated using the 2 ̆ 2 conventional linear synthetic array 2 ̆ 2 imaging technique. A singular transducer is <b>actuated</b> from predefined <b>positions</b> to produce an array of signals that are subsequently arranged and added to construct an acoustic image. Three sets of experiment are presented in this research for validating the proposed concept: tension estimation of a ¼ inch stainless steel bolt, a ½ inch stainless steel bolt and ¼ inch grade 8 bolt. Acoustic images of the surface of the clamped plate illustrate a clear trend in the position of the reflective boundary when torque is changed. In all cases, the torque increments increase the real area of contact and therefore the position of the reflective boundary. As expected, the real area of contact grew from the bolt head center to the perimeter, which causes an effect of apparent movement of the boundary. This research proves the potential of the ultrasonic imaging methodology to measure applied tension. The result showed that the system can be used to successfully inspect tension in bolts of ½ and ¼ inches. The methodology investigated in this thesis is the first steps towards the development of bolt tension sensor based on surface acoustic waves...|$|R
