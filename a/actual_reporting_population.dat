40|$|Sixty {{teachers}} from the Ottawa-Carleton region of Canada were surveyed to measure {{their knowledge of}} child maltreatment risk indicators, knowledge of reporting procedures, {{and the frequency of}} reporting sexual abuse, physical abuse, and neglect. Correlations did not support the hypothesis of a significant relationship between knowledge and <b>actual</b> <b>reporting</b> frequency. Multiple Regression analyses demonstrated that the knowledge of child maltreatment risk factors and the knowledge of reporting procedures were not predictive of reporting. It was found that the teachers sampled were very knowledgeable of the basic risk indicators of child maltreatment and reporting procedures and policy. However, the findings did not support the hypotheses of a significant relationship between knowledge of child maltreatment risk factors and of <b>reporting</b> procedures and <b>actual</b> <b>reporting</b> frequency. These findings are discussed in consideration of the limitations of the current study, the implications for practice and the possibilities for further research...|$|R

The only ones that have <b>reported</b> <b>population</b> in each census since 1900 are Dixville Township, Millsfield Township and Wentworth’s Location (bearing in mind that Wentworth’s Location was an incorporated town for many years prior to the 1960s). All three appear to have small but well-established population bases. Wentworth’s Location has <b>reported</b> a <b>population</b> of at least 37 in every post-1900 census. Dixville and Millsfield have consistently been in double figures throughout the same period (the only exceptions being Millsfield in 1960 and 1980); in both communities, a town clerk's office exist for the purpose of conducting elections for state and federal officials. In addition to those noted above, Pinkham’s Grant <b>reported</b> <b>population</b> in every census from 1930 to 1990, although its population exceeded 17 in only one census, and it <b>reported</b> no <b>population</b> in 2000.|$|R
