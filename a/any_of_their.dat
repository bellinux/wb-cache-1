Around this time Luke Morton had left the band without {{appearing}} on <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> formal recordings. They released their debut Act of Depression, which sold over 2,000 copies.|$|E

5|$|Piłsudski's plan {{met with}} {{opposition}} {{from most of}} the prospective member states—who refused to relinquish <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> hard-won independence—as well as from the Allied powers, for whom it would be too bold a change to the existing balance-of-power structure. According to historian George Sanford, around 1920 Piłsudski came to realize the infeasibility of this version of his Intermarium project.|$|E
5|$|Reportedly, all {{of those}} under {{scrutiny}} are now rarely seen in public and some have apparently left the country. They are also reportedly the subjects of an ongoing investigation to determine if <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> business practices warrant criminal prosecution.|$|E
5|$|The talkies {{were very}} well {{received}} and hugely successful. The Capitol's business improved greatly {{in the weeks}} after re-opening; the size and volume of their advertising in the Journal and Bulletin increased in March, and by April 1929 was several times that of <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> competitors. Other theatres were pressured to modernize their equipment or close.|$|E

5|$|The team {{spent much}} of the 2011–12 season in or around the playoff places, and {{achieved}} the double over rivals (and eventual champions) Swindon Town {{for the first time since}} the 1973–74 season.

5|$|A third raid, {{consisting}} of six unescorted Hudsons of No. 62 Squadron RAF, flying from Palembang, Sumatra, attacked shortly afterwards, losing {{two of their}} number, with their entire crews, to six Ki-27s. A fourth raid, made up of five Bristol Blenheims of No. 27 Squadron RAF, set off from Palembang later in the day, but had only {{got as far as}} Singapore by sunset, so aborted the mission. Despite claims to have scored multiple hits on both transports and a cruiser, neither the transports, nor <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> escorts were damaged; the former were hit by splinters that killed 8 and wounded 18, but Sendai and the smaller ships were untouched.|$|E
5|$|After {{these steps}} {{alleviated}} their most urgent needs, the Austro-Hungarian Navy selected the German Type UB II design for its newest submarines in mid 1915. The Germans {{were reluctant to}} allocate <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> wartime resources to Austro-Hungarian construction, but were willing to sell plans {{for up to six}} of the UB II boats to be constructed under license in Austria-Hungary. The Navy agreed to the proposal and purchased the plans from AG Weser of Bremen.|$|E

5|$|Both teams {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the third round. The majority of Liverpool's matches were close affairs, they didn't score more than two goals in <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> matches and this was also their biggest margin of victory. Leeds' matches ranged from close affairs to comfortable victories. They won their third round tie against Stockport County 3–0, while they beat Manchester United 1–0 in a semi-final replay following a 0–0 draw in the initial match.|$|E
5|$|Common elands {{communicate}} via gestures, vocalizations, scent cues {{and display}} behaviors. The flehmen response also occurs, primarily in males {{in response to}} contact with female urine or genitals. Females will urinate to indicate fertility during the appropriate phase of their estrous cycle, {{as well as to}} indicate their lack of fertility when harassed by males. If eland bulls find <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> predators nearby, they will bark and attempt {{to attract the attention of}} others by trotting back and forth until the entire herd is conscious of the danger. Some of their main predators include lions, African wild dogs, cheetahs and spotted hyenas. Juvenile elands are more vulnerable than adults to their predators.|$|E

5|$|Historically, the British and Irish Lions were {{intended}} as a representative team of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland however, when the Irish Free State {{broke away from the}} United Kingdom it was deemed inappropriate for the British and Irish Lions to use the British national anthem, God Save the Queen. As a result of this, the British and Irish Lions did not have an anthem to represent them before <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> matches until 2005.|$|E
5|$|Hood was {{the closest}} to {{completion}} and her construction was continued in case the Germans managed to complete <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> new battlecruisers. Admiral Beatty continually pressed to have Hoods construction expedited and for her sisters to be restarted, but the War Cabinet refused to approve either measure as nothing could be sacrificed in the shipbuilding programme to this end. After {{the end of the}} war the three suspended ships were cancelled as they could not fully incorporate the lessons of the war.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} any {{acknowledgement}} of the mutual existence between the scriptores, only Flavius Vopiscus (ostensibly writing in 305 or 306) refers {{to any of the}} other authors (specifically Trebellius Pollio, Julius Capitolinus and Aelius Lampridius). None of the other five demonstrate any awareness of the existence of <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> 'colleagues'. However, these references cause difficulties when these authors also address Constantine in their dedications, as Vopiscus was also doing. For instance, Capitolinus mostly addresses Diocletian, but in the Albinus, Maximini and Gordiani he addresses Constantine in a fashion that suggests he is writing after 306.|$|E

5|$|Local transit {{services}} in the city have been available since 1925 and have been provided through the City of Amarillo's Amarillo City Transit (ACT) department since 1966; before that time the system was privately owned. ACT operates bus services that include fixed route transit and demand response paratransit which are designed for people with disabilities. The ACT transports approximately 350,000 passengers per year on the fixed route and 30,000 paratransit passengers, {{but it is a}} declining ridership. ACT has no plans to scale back <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> transit routes or services.|$|E
5|$|Magic is {{a common}} ability in the game, and several {{character}} classes use it. Spells are divided into two groups: White, which is defensive and healing, and Black, which is debilitating and destructive. Magic can be bought from White and Black magic shops and assigned to characters whose occupation allows them to use it. Spells are classified by a level between one and eight, with four White and four Black spells per level. Each character may learn only three spells per level. White and Black Mages can potentially learn <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> respective spells, while Red Mages, the Ninja, and the Knight cannot use most high-level magic.|$|E
5|$|Middlesbrough, {{also from}} the Premier League, were the {{opposition}} in the semi-final at the neutral venue of Villa Park in Birmingham. Before the game both players and supporters paused to remember the life of West Ham's recently deceased former manager, John Lyall. The first half saw Middlesbrough dominate, but {{they were unable to}} convert <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> chances into goals. They also lost goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer to injury. A long pass by defender Anton Ferdinand was headed down by Ashton to Harewood, whose goal ensured a 1–0 victory for West Ham and a place in the final.|$|E
