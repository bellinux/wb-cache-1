5|$|Substantial combat {{had ended}} {{but the war}} had not, and a formal treaty of peace was months away. The British still had 26,000 troops occupying New York City, Charleston, and Savannah, and had a {{powerful}} fleet. The French army and navy departed, so the Americans were on their own in 1782–83. Money matters fed the anxiety; the treasury was empty, and the unpaid soldiers were growing restive <b>almost</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of mutiny. At one point, they forced an adjournment of the Congress from Philadelphia to Princeton.

5|$|The Canadian {{horse is}} a horse breed from Canada. It is a strong, {{well-muscled}} breed of horse, usually dark in colour. The horses are generally used for riding and driving. Descended from draft and light riding horses imported to Canada {{in the late}} 1600s, it was later crossed with other British and American breeds. During the 18th century the Canadian horse spread throughout the northeastern US, where it contributed {{to the development of}} several horse breeds. During the peak popularity of the breed, three subtypes could be distinguished, a draft horse type, a trotting type and a pacing type. Thousands of horses were exported in the 19th century, many of whom were subsequently killed while acting as cavalry horses in the American Civil War. These exports decreased the purebred Canadian population <b>almost</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of extinction, prompting the formation of a studbook and the passage of a law against further export.|$|E
5|$|The Newfoundland pony is a {{breed of}} pony {{originating}} in Newfoundland, Canada. They are sturdy and muscular ponies, {{found in many}} colors, including the relatively rare white coloration. The Newfoundland developed from a mix of English, Irish and Scottish pony breeds brought to Newfoundland by settlers {{over a period of}} four centuries. Initially free-roaming, they crossbred to produce the modern type. They were used by settlers as draft and multi-purpose ponies until the mid-20th century, when they were brought <b>almost</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of extinction by mechanization and slaughter. The population rebounded slightly after the formation of a breed registry in 1980, but still remains low. In 1997, the Newfoundland pony was declared a heritage breed of Newfoundland and Labrador, which afforded it protection under the law, but the breed has not yet been recognized under the Canadian federal Animal Pedigree Act. As of 2008, there were 248 registered ponies of breeding age, out of a total population of 361. In 2013, the widely dispersed breeding population is still estimated at between 200 and 250 animals.|$|E

25|$|After the 11th century, the Byzantine Rite was {{gradually}} becoming {{dominant in the}} Eastern Orthodox world, <b>almost</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of exclusion of any other liturgy.

25|$|In {{response}} to continued British interference with American shipping (including {{the practice of}} impressment of American sailors into the British Navy), and to British aid to American Indians in the Old Northwest, the Twelfth Congress—led by Southern and Western Jeffersonians—declared war on Britain in 1812. Westerners and Southerners were the most ardent supporters of the war, given their concerns about defending national honor and expanding western settlements, and having access to world markets for their agricultural exports. New England was making a fine profit and its Federalists opposed the war, <b>almost</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of secession. The Federalist reputation collapsed in the triumphalism of 1815 and the party no longer played a national role.|$|E

He strongly opposed the annexation of the Philippines, <b>almost</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of supporting William Jennings Bryan against McKinley in 1900. In 1898, Carnegie tried to arrange for independence for the Philippines. As {{the end of the}} Spanish–American War neared, the United States bought the Philippines from Spain for $20 million. To counter what he perceived as imperialism {{on the part of the}} United States, Carnegie personally offered $20 million to the Philippines so that the Filipino people could buy their independence from the United States. However, nothing came of the offer. In 1898 Carnegie joined the American Anti-Imperialist League, in opposition to the U.S. annexation of the Philippines. Its membership included former presidents of the United States Grover Cleveland and Benjamin Harrison and literary figures like Mark Twain.|$|E

When fans began to worry and cry, he became annoyed and screamed at the fans to shut up. Fans also complained that when Fahrenheit was dancing, Kao had caused them to NG many times and therefore they were required to dance several more times. Fans witnessed an extremely exhausted Jiro Wang, who was <b>almost</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of collapsing after dancing.
