5|$|In autumn, Granpa and Emily went fishing, <b>and</b> <b>imagined</b> of {{catching}} a whale that haled {{them through the}} Thames and through London. At bedtime, Granpa tells Emily the story of The Three Knights, of which was imagined on a bed covers. Though as he reads, he begins to slow up as he begins to drop off. So he end it with his own version, just as Emily was finally going to sleep.|$|E
5|$|Merrick {{is portrayed}} in two episodes in 2013 (the second season) of the BBC {{historical}} crime drama Ripper Street, portrayed by actor Joseph Drake. In 2017, the Malthouse Theatre, Melbourne commissioned playwright Tom Wright {{to write a}} play about Merrick's life. The Real <b>and</b> <b>Imagined</b> History of the Elephant Man premiered on August 4, and starred Daniel Monks in the title role. The cast also featured Paula Arundell, Julie Forsyth, Emma J Hawkins, and Sophie Ross.|$|E
5|$|A life of Augustine {{was written}} by Goscelin around 1090, but this life portrays Augustine in a {{different}} light than Bede's account. Goscelin's account has little new historical content, mainly being filled with miracles <b>and</b> <b>imagined</b> speeches. Building on this account, later medieval writers continued to add new miracles and stories to Augustine's life, often quite fanciful. These authors included William of Malmesbury, who claimed that Augustine founded Cerne Abbey, the author (generally believed to be John Brompton) of a late medieval chronicle containing invented letters from Augustine, and a number of medieval writers who included Augustine in their romances. Another problem with investigating Augustine's saintly cult is the confusion resulting because most medieval liturgical documents mentioning Augustine do not distinguish between Augustine of Canterbury and Augustine of Hippo, a fourth-century saint. Medieval Scandinavian liturgies feature Augustine of Canterbury quite often, however. During the English Reformation, Augustine's shrine was destroyed and his relics were lost.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2010, the {{development}} team spent five days and four nights {{in a place called}} the Capcom Manor to work on the game; this was inspired by the filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, who would gather scriptwriters in a hotel room to create the scripts for his films. During their stay in the manor, they discussed the game's plot and the new gameplay system, finalized the direction, and created rough sketches for most characters in the game. For the new character Hakari Mikagami, Iwamoto used a female saint as the main image for her design, <b>and</b> <b>imagined</b> her as being an older woman he could look up to. Another new character, Yumihiko Ichiyanagi, was Eshiro's favorite minor character in the series because of his character arc and how he grows throughout the game. The game was developed for the Ace Attorney series' tenth anniversary; because of this, several characters from previous games in the series made cameo appearances, including Frank Sahwit and Will Powers.|$|E
5|$|Many {{works of}} crime and horror have been set in the Peak. The Terror of Blue John Gap by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859–1930) recounts terrible events at the Blue John mines, and Sherlock Holmes investigates the {{kidnapping}} of {{a child in the}} region in The Adventure of the Priory School. Many of the horror stories of local author Robert Murray Gilchrist (1878–1916) feature Peak settings. More recently, Stephen Booth has written a series of crime novels set in various real <b>and</b> <b>imagined</b> Peak locations, while In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner, an Inspector Lynley mystery by Elizabeth George, is set on the fictional Calder Moor.|$|E
5|$|The {{anonymous}} author {{tells us that}} Padarn's parents were nobly born Armoricans (Bretons), and that he sailed to Britain with 847 monks to settle and build a monastery. He established monasteries and churches throughout Ceredigion. The attempt of Maelgwn, king of Gwynedd, to ruin Padarn rebounds on him through a miracle, and he compensates Padarn with the gift of lands between the rivers Rheidol and Clarach. Saint Padarn is closely associated with Saint David and Saint Teilo in a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in which the three are honoured by the Patriarch. Padarn was given a tunic – which later featured in the best known legend associated with him – and a staff. Most likely this account is fabricated, as are much {{of the details of}} the lives of the early saints, from a variety of sources, real <b>and</b> <b>imagined.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} perceiving <b>and</b> <b>imagining</b> {{on the basis of}} predictive processing models in neuroscience. Contrary to the received view in philosophy of mind, which holds that perceiving <b>and</b> <b>imagining</b> are essentially distinct, these models depict perceiving <b>and</b> <b>imagining</b> as deeply unified and overlapping. It is argued that there are two mutually exclusive implications of taking perception and imagination to be fundamentally unified. The view defended is what I dub the ecological¿enactive view given that it does not succumb to internalism about the mind-world relation, and allows one to keep a version of the received view in play...|$|R

5|$|The New Kingdom pharaohs began a {{large-scale}} building {{campaign to promote}} the god Amun, whose growing cult was based in Karnak. They also constructed monuments to glorify their own achievements, both real <b>and</b> <b>imagined.</b> The Karnak temple is the largest Egyptian temple ever built. The pharaoh Hatshepsut used such hyperbole and grandeur during her reign of almost twenty-two years. Her reign was very successful, marked by {{an extended period of}} peace and wealth-building, trading expeditions to Punt, restoration of foreign trade networks, and great building projects, including an elegant mortuary temple that rivaled the Greek architecture of a thousand years later, a colossal pair of obelisks, and a chapel at Karnak. Despite her achievements, Amenhotep II, the heir to Hatshepsut's nephew-stepson Tuthmosis III, sought to erase her legacy {{near the end of his}} father's reign and throughout his, touting many of her accomplishments as his. He also tried to change many established traditions that had developed over the centuries, which some suggest was a futile attempt to prevent other women from becoming pharaoh and to curb their influence in the kingdom.|$|E

40|$|Remembering <b>and</b> <b>imagining</b> are {{intricately}} related, {{particularly in}} imagining the future: episodic future thinking. It is proposed that remembering {{the recent past}} <b>and</b> <b>imagining</b> the near future take place in what we term the remembering–imagining system. The remembering–imagining system renders recently formed episodic memories <b>and</b> episodic <b>imagined</b> near-future events highly accessible. We suggest that this serves the purpose of integrating past, current, and future goal-related activities. When the remembering–imagining system is compromised, following brain damage and in psychological illnesses, the future cannot be effectively <b>imagined</b> <b>and</b> episodic future thinking may become dominated by dysfunctional images of the future...|$|R

25|$|Often grouped {{together}} with propaganda as agitprop, agitation {{is the use}} of agitators to stir up discontent both real <b>and</b> <b>imagined</b> with the regime and to propose a course of action to right these perceived wrongs.

Now, she describes her identity as a “hybrid of acquired American beliefs <b>and</b> <b>imagined</b> Japanese sentiments”. She became a U.S citizen in 1993.|$|E
25|$|The framing arch of each {{panel is}} historiated, {{containing}} {{series of small}} <b>and</b> <b>imagined</b> but highly detailed and symbolic, protruding or raised, marble statues which augment the narrative of the particular episode from Christ's life. The triptych {{is often associated with}} van der Weyden's other John the Baptist altarpiece as both utilise imagined stone reliefs both as framing devices and as a means to develop on the main theme of the particular panel. The arches are painted in browns, likely to give the appearance of timber. They are fantastic rather than realistic, serving as a device to include the small relief figures located in the archivolts which reflect on and accentuate the narrative and theme of the panel on which they appear.|$|E
