500|$|The {{invasion}} of Norway {{took place in}} early April 1940. Königsberg was assigned to Gruppe 3, and was tasked with transporting 600 troops from the Wehrmacht's 69th Infantry Division from Wilhelmshaven to Bergen, Norway. Gruppe 3 also included her sister ship , the artillery training ship , and the torpedo boats Wolf and Leopard. The Germans left Wilhelmshaven on 8 April, and had reached their target the following day, where Königsberg transferred part of the landing party to several smaller vessels. She then made a high-speed run into the port {{in an attempt to}} land the remainder of the infantry in the town directly. A [...] coastal battery at the Kvarven Fort took the ship under fire, and scored three hits, <b>all</b> <b>forward.</b> The hits caused severe flooding and fires in her boiler rooms that cut the ship's power. Adrift, and unable to maneuver, Königsberg had to drop anchor, while she and Köln, Luftwaffe bombers, and the infantry neutralized the Norwegian guns.|$|E

[...] It has paddle-shifts mounted behind the flat-bottomed steering wheel, similar in design to the Audi B7 RS 4. [...] The gearbox is set by default, in conventional automatic mode, to delay up-changes during acceleration, and change down earlier to maximise engine braking. [...] Downchanges in all modes of operation include the Powertrain Control Module electronic control unit (ECU) [...] "blipping" [...] the Bosch [...] "E-Gas" [...] drive by wire throttle, for smoother shift changes.
