5|$|A gritter, {{also known}} as a sander, salt {{spreader}} or salt truck, is found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the gritter is so commonly seen on winter service vehicles that the terms are sometimes used synonymously. Gritters are used to spread grit (rock salt), onto roads. The grit is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, with a wire mesh over the top to prevent foreign objects from entering the spreading mechanism and hence becoming jammed. The salt is generally spread across the roadway by <b>an</b> <b>impeller,</b> attached by a hydraulic drive system to a small onboard engine. However, until the 1970s, the grit was often spread manually using shovels by men riding {{on the back of the}} truck, and some older spreading mechanisms still require grit be manually loaded into the impeller from the hopper.|$|E
5|$|For testing purposes, a {{new engine}} {{consisting}} of six Armstrong Siddeley Viper jet engines blowing across the outer rim of <b>an</b> <b>impeller</b> was designed {{under the name}} PV-704, PV stood for Private Venture. The PV-704 was a stop-gap design built into a bunker-like building behind the Avro Experimental Test facility. It was intended to test various Project 1794 concepts and provide the USAF with test data to show {{the viability of the}} concept. The original plan to initially test the Viper Engine Rig was to have continued into free flight testing. Unfortunately, testing was anything but smooth; the test model suffered from hazardous oil leaks, resulting in three fires. It eventually got to the point that staff were afraid of the machine, even when safely ensconced in a booth constructed of bullet-proof glass and quarter-inch-thick steel. A final, disastrous and nearly lethal engine test in 1956 which involved a Viper jet engine running wild, convinced Frost that a less dangerous test vehicle was necessary.|$|E

40|$|Dispersion of {{liquid-liquid}} {{systems is}} often applied in industrial {{processes such as}} extraction, suspension, and emulsion polymerization. The influence of emulsification of the monomer in the aqueous phase on the course and outcome of the batch emulsion polymerization of styrene has been studied. A visual criterion was applied for determining the lowest impeller speed for sufficient emulsification (N*). It appeared that in polymerization experiments under the same conditions, N* was the critical value above which no further increase in polymerization rate was observed. Using <b>a</b> turbine <b>impeller</b> instead of <b>a</b> pitched blade <b>impeller</b> as well as using <b>a</b> larger <b>impeller</b> diameter provides better emulsification at constant power input.

50|$|These {{issues are}} due to the exposed tail rotor cutting through open air around rear of the vehicle.

40|$|Olive pomace (OP) {{and olive}} mill wastewaters (OMW) are two {{residues}} that {{are derived from}} olive oil production. The high TS content {{and the presence of}} polymeric ligno-cellulosic compounds impart a very high viscosity value of about 180 cP to the OP-OMW mixture. In this condition, the Rushton impeller, which is normally used in digesters, is unable to guarantee a homogenous mixing of the reactor medium. Four different impellers have been tested with the aim of improving the mixing of the reaction medium: <b>a</b> Pelton <b>Impeller,</b> <b>a</b> Rushton <b>impeller</b> with six 45 inclined blades, <b>a</b> marine <b>impeller</b> (MI) with three blades and <b>an</b> anchor <b>impeller</b> (AI). The marine and the anchor impellers have permitted homogenization of the reaction medium and have consequently led to a good biogas production. Therefore, these two impellers have been used in combination with a two-stage AD configuration, based on the separation of the two distinctly different groups of bacteria (acidogens and methanogens), in order to reproduce the optimal operative conditions for the different microorganisms in each stage. The tests have demonstrated that an AI can be recommended for a one-stage configuration, while a MI is necessary for a two-stage configuration...|$|R
