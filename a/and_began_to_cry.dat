25|$|Beck and Fernandez {{traveled}} to Byron Center Road in Wyoming Township, Michigan, {{a suburb of}} Grand Rapids, where they met and stayed with Delphine Downing, a young widow with a two-year-old daughter. On February 28, Downing became agitated, and Fernandez gave her sleeping pills to calm her. The daughter witnessed Downing's resulting stupor <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry,</b> which enraged Beck. Panicked, Beck choked the child but didn't kill her. Fernandez thought Downing would become suspicious if she saw her bruised daughter, so he shot the unconscious woman. The couple then stayed for several days in Downing's house. Again enraged by the daughter's crying, Beck drowned her in a basin of water. They buried the bodies in the basement, but suspicious neighbors reported the Downings' disappearances, leading the police {{to arrive at the}} door on March 1, 1949 and arrest Beck and Fernandez.|$|E
500|$|News of Arthur's death reached Henry VII's court late on 4 April. The King was awoken {{from his}} sleep by his confessor, who quoted Job by asking Henry [...] "If we receive good {{things at the}} hands of God, why may we not endure evil things?" [...] He then told the king that [...] " [...] dearest son hath {{departed}} to God," [...] and Henry burst into tears. [...] "Grief-stricken and emotional," [...] he then had his wife brought into his chambers, so that they might [...] "take the painful news together"; Elizabeth reminded Henry that God had helped him become king and [...] "had ever preserved him," [...] adding that they had been left with [...] "yet a fair Prince and two fair princesses and that God is where he was, and [...] both young enough." [...] Soon after leaving Henry's bedchamber, Elizabeth collapsed <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry,</b> while the ladies sent for the King, who hurriedly came and [...] "relieved her." ...|$|E
500|$|The concert {{itself was}} {{received}} enthusiastically by the Osaka audience. [...] "I {{had no idea}} what [...] were going to do", Henderson recalled. [...] "They gave us a standing ovation that was almost as long as the concert." [...] Upon returning from Japan, Davis fell ill again and was hospitalized for three months. He held a few more shows and studio sessions with the band, but his health worsened; their last show on September 5, 1975, in Central Park ended abruptly when Davis left the stage <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> in pain. He retired soon after—citing physical, spiritual, and creative exhaustion—and lived as a recluse for the next several years, often struggling with bouts of depression and further medical treatment. Agharta was reassessed positively by critics during this period, and in 1980 Davis returned to recording music. He abandoned the direction he had pursued in the 1970s, instead playing a style of fusion far more melodic and accessible to audiences, until his death in 1991. The day after he died, Prague's Wenceslas Square saw the opening of the AghaRTA Jazz Centrum, a small jazz club named after the album, hosting nightly performances and an annual festival played by local and international acts. In January of that year, Agharta was reissued in the U.S. by Columbia on CD, featuring a remaster Tingen deemed inferior to the original LP in sound and mix quality. Sony later remastered it again as part of their Davis reissue campaign and Master Sound series in Japan, with improved sound using Super Bit Mapping. This remaster was made available in the U.S. {{for the first time in}} 2009, when Agharta was one of 52 albums re-issued in mini-LP replica sleeves as a part of , a box set released by Sony Legacy.|$|E

[...] During the final decade, Ruiz says she saw a light emanating from {{a portrait of the}} Immaculate Heart of Mary that grew brighter until it forced her to close her eyes. [...] At that moment, the Virgin spoke to her: [...] "Don't you know that I am {{going to take care of}} your children?"

[...] He left his oldest biological son Xu Zhixun in command at Guangling as junior regent, with Xu Wen himself only ruling {{on the most important}} matters. [...] As junior regent, Xu Zhixun grew arrogant, alienating the Wu officials and officers. [...] He was even disrespectful to Yang Longyan, who was formally his sovereign. [...] For example, once he put on a play with himself playing the character of an army officer and with Yang Longyan playing the character of a servant, following him around abjectly. [...] He also once fired slingshots at Yang Longyan when they both went on a river cruise. [...] On yet another occasion, when they were both watching flowers at Chanzhi Temple (禪智寺), Xu Zhixun was drunk and became very insulting toward Yang Longyan, such that the prince became fearful <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry.</b> [...] The prince's attendants quickly put him on a boat and left the scene. [...] Xu Zhixun tried to give chase, and when he could not catch up to Yang Longyan, he killed some of Yang Longyan's attendants. [...] Once, when Xu Zhixun heard that the general Li Decheng had many singing girls in his household, he sent a demand to Li that the singing girls be given to him. [...] When Li responded that these singing girls were too old for Xu and that he would try to find younger and more beautiful ones for Xu, Xu responded to Li's messenger, [...] "One day I will kill Li Decheng and take even his wife!" [...] These unlawful deeds, however, were said to be unreported to Xu Wen as the staff members were fearful of the consequences of reporting.|$|E
