For this purpose, {{the problem is}} formulated according {{to the idea that}} the electric vehicle is an electromechanical interaction system. The iterate approach is applied to this result, and one numerical analysis procedure is proposed. From this numerical analysis results, we have made clear that there is a linear relation between the time ratio and the steady state velocity in this <b>accelerator</b> <b>circuit.</b> This means that the steady state velocity of the electric vehicle can be excellently controlled by adjusting the time ratio. As a result, it has been proven that this <b>accelerator</b> <b>circuit</b> is practicable one...|$|E
40|$|This thesis proposes {{the design}} method of the {{electronic}} <b>accelerator</b> <b>circuit</b> for the electric vehicle. Forthis purpose, analytical solutions of (I 0,V 0) and (I 1,V 1) are led, which are, respectively, the initial values ofcurrent and speed on the transistor conduction period and those values on the transistor non-conduction period. Two facts have been clarified that "Abnormal rise" phenomenon appears at the speed {{in the area of}} time-ratiowhere the coil-current I 0 becomes negative, and there is a time period where the coil current does not flow onthe transistor non-conduction period. The author has named this form of coil current as "Discontinuous modeof the coil current", and that of the coil current corresponding to the area of time-ratio where I 0 becomespositive is named "Continuous mode of the coil current". To design the <b>accelerator</b> <b>circuit</b> where a steady speedand the time-ratio are in a linear relation, it is clarified that we have to set the switching frequency, where thecoil current operates on "Continuous mode of the coil current" in all area of the time-ratio...|$|E

This is to be compared with the case without the accelerator of the order of µs and thus the acceleration by two orders of magnitude is achieved.

40|$|Abstract Designing {{energy-efficient}} multiprocessing hardware {{for applications}} such as video decoding or MIMO-OFDM baseband processing is challenging because these applications require high throughput, as well as flexibility for efficient use of the processing resources. Application specific hardwired <b>accelerator</b> <b>circuits</b> are the most energy-efficient processing resources, but are inflexible by nature. Furthermore, designing an application specific circuit is expensive and time-consuming. A solution that maintains the energy-efficiency of <b>accelerator</b> <b>circuits,</b> but makes them flexible as well, {{is to make the}} <b>accelerator</b> <b>circuits</b> fine-grained. Fine-grained application specific processing elements can be designed to implement general purpose functions {{that can be used in}} several applications and their small size makes the design and verification times reasonable. This thesis proposes an efficient method for orchestrating the use of heterogeneous fine-grained processing elements in dynamic applications without introducing tremendous orchestration overheads. Furthermore, the thesis presents a processing element management unit which performs scheduling and independent dispatching, and works with such low overheads that the use of low latency processing elements becomes worthwhile and efficient. Dynamic orchestration of processing elements requires run-time scheduling that has to be done very fast and with as few resources as possible, for which this work proposes dividing the application into short static parts, whose schedules can be determined at system design time. This approach, often called quasi-static scheduling, captures the dynamic nature of the application, as well as minimizes the computations of run-time scheduling. Enabling low overhead quasi-static scheduling required studying simultaneously the computational complexity and performance of simple but efficient scheduling algorithms. The requirements lead to the use of flow-shop scheduling. This thesis is the first work that adapts the flow-shop scheduling algorithms to different multiprocessor memory architectures. An extension to the flow-shop model is also presented, which enables modeling a wider scope of applications than traditional flow-shop. The feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated with a real multiprocessor solution that is instantiated on a field-programmable gate array...|$|R

40|$|Systems {{biology is}} an {{emergent}} {{field in the}} biological sciences that has enabled biologists to quantitatively study gene circuits and networks by integrating mathematical modeling, bioinformatics, and biological approaches. Here, we use mathematical modeling and single- cell fluorescence microscopy to reveal a novel gene circuitry in CMV, a global pathogen and major health concern in infants and immunocompromised individuals. This gene circuitry produces acceleration while limiting amplification of output protein levels {{in the presence of}} transactivators. IE 2 (Immediate-Early 2), CMV's essential viral transactivator, drives this <b>accelerator</b> <b>circuit</b> by autoregulating itself via cooperative binding to the cis repression sequence (crs), a 12 base-pair (bp) sequence located just upstream of the Major Immediate-Early promoter (MIEP) 's Initiator site. IE 2 acceleration produces a viral replication fitness advantage, and mutation of the crs sequence eliminates IE 2 acceleration and produces amplification of IE 2 protein in response to transactivators, severely limiting CMV's replication ability. The [Delta]crs mutant virus exhibits lowered transcriptional strength due to its inability to efficiently localize to sub-nuclear PML bodies, where CMV immediate-early transcription typically occurs. The low transcriptional strength in the [Delta]crs mutant virus results in slower IE 2 expression and a severe fitness cost. To further understand the mechanism behind the IE 2 <b>accelerator</b> <b>circuit,</b> IE 2 's interaction with the crs sequence was studied using gel filtration chromatography and electron microscopy. IE 2 self-multimerizes into a ring -like structure in the presence of crs DNA, using multiple IE 2 subunits. IE 2 multimerization only occurs {{in the presence of the}} crs sequence and does not occur in the presence of a mutated crs sequenc...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} dynamic {{optimization}} technique, thread warping, {{that uses a}} single processor on a multiprocessor system to dynamically synthesize threads into custom <b>accelerator</b> <b>circuits</b> on FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays). Building on dynamic synthesis for single-processor single-thread systems, known as warp processing, thread warping improves performances of multiprocessor systems by speeding up individual threads and by allowing more threads to execute concurrently. Furthermore, thread warping maintains the important separation of function from architecture, enabling portability of applications to architectures with different quantities of microprocessors and FPGA—an advantage not shared by static compilation/synthesis approaches. We introduce a framework of architecture, CAD tools, and operating system that together support thread warping. We summarize experiments on an extensive architectural simulation framework we developed, showing application speedups of 4 x to 502 x, averaging 130 x compared to a multiprocessor system having four ARM 11 microprocessors, for eight benchmark applications. Even compared to a 64 -processor system, thread warping achieves 11 x speedup...|$|R

40|$|Linear {{induction}} {{cells are}} used in the electron beam accelerator for the proposed Dual Axis Radiographic Hydrotest (DARHT) facility that would be built at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Ferrite cores {{are used in}} each cell to produce 250 kV, flat to within {plus_minus} 1 % for 70 ns. In the course of operating a prototype test stand for the full <b>accelerator,</b> <b>circuit</b> models have been developed for the pulsed power system and the induction cells that have been useful in achieving the {plus_minus} 1 % flatness requirement. The circuit models use the MicroCap IV{trademark} electronic circuit analysis program, which includes a Jiles-Atherton model for magnetic materials. In addition, the coaxial, ferrite-filled geometry of the cell is modelled by a multiple-section lumped-element transmission line. Propagation of a voltage pulse through the ferrite cores, including saturation effects, can be reproduced. The model has been compared to actual waveforms obtained from prototype operations, and good results have been obtained {{for a wide range of}} operating conditions. Interest in possible future applications have led the authors to use the model to predict the behavior of accelerator cells driven by multiple voltage pulses without an intervening magnetic reset of the ferrite cores. Results show that multiple pulses can be applied to the accelerator cells without a magnetic reset, but with some degradation of later pulses. The degradation appears as a droop on the flat portion of the second (and subsequent) pulses. The droop can be corrected by shaping the waveform of the incident pulses...|$|E

These 15 -m-long magnets are wound from Nb-Ti superconducting Rutherford cables, and have active quench detection triggering heaters to quickly force the transition of the coil to the normal conducting state {{in case of a}} quench, and hence reduce the hot spot temperature.

40|$|Modern {{embedded}} compute platforms increasingly contain both microprocessors and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The FPGAs may implement <b>accelerators</b> {{or other}} <b>circuits</b> to speedup performance. Many such circuits have been previously designed for acceleration via application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Redesigning an ASIC circuit for FPGA implementation involves several challenges. We describe {{a case study}} that highlights a common challenge related to memories. The study involves converting a pattern counting circuit architecture, based on a pipelined binary tree and originally designed for ASIC implementation, into a circuit suitable for FPGAs. The original ASIC-oriented circuit, when mapped to a Spartan 3 e FPGA, could process 10 million patterns per second and handle up to 4, 096 patterns. The redesigned circuit could instead process 100 million patterns per second and handle up to 32, 768 patterns, representing a 10 x performance improvement and a 4 x utilization improvement.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{specification}} {{and development of}} a communication and control system is described. The system {{is intended to be}} applied primarily to a low energy particle <b>accelerator.</b> The electronic <b>circuits</b> and the processing and interface elements required for accelerator operation are considered as part of the system. This work can be divided into three separate parts. In the first one a mechanical and electrical project for an accelerator prototype is presented and the specifications of the communication and control system are established. The second part discusses the project and development of such a system. Finally, the third part is devoted to power converters. These elements play an essential role in the accelerator operation and control. In the project of the accelerator prototype, a linear configuration based on a constant gradient tube is proposed. The voltage gradient of the tube is obtained with a resistive divider powered by a high voltage Cockroft-Walton type supply. For the generation of charged particles a radio-frequency ion source is proposed. Solutions for the mechanical, electrical and vacuum problems are presented. The operation, monitoring and control requirements of such a prototype are also identified.
