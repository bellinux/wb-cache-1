The current study examines the relationship between religious involvement, religious beliefs, and mammography usage in a nationally representative sample of Presbyterian women (N = 1, 070). We use multivariate logistic regression models to estimate the influence of religious service attendance and two health-related religious beliefs on self-reported mammography use. The findings show that religious attendance is significantly associated with mammogram use. Women who attend services nearly every week are almost {{twice as likely to}} use mammograms compared to women who attend services less frequently or never.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to see whether the {{preservation}} of cybercafés ’ internet <b>access</b> <b>offering</b> could efficiently withstand the generalization of other internet access modes. To do this, we use the economic theory of Property Rights to show that, considering internet access as an economic good, it is possible to distinguish three internet access modes: the rental internet access mode, the usufruct internet access mode and the full ownership internet access mode. On this basis, the preservation of cybercafés ’ activities depends inter alia on the hypothesis of an absence of substitutability between the rental access mode they offered and the two other access modes. This hypothesis is tested using a probit model on data from a survey carried out in three towns of Cameroon. The findings show there is room for substitutability between the cybercafés ’ offering and the alternative internet access modes. The no substitutability hypothesis is then disproved. We conclude that cybercafés ’ owners should contemplate further diversification strategies. 1...|$|E

40|$|Connectivity {{is vital}} to any country to usher in {{economic}} growth, better education and healthcare and improved entertainment services as it has done elsewhere in the world. And the solution must be wireless, to avoid the overwhelming cost and resources {{that would be required}} to deploy countrywide fixed-line broadband Internet infrastructure. Some countries, where there is not an established wired communication network, are investigating the potential of broadband wireless technologies to support learning and teaching in remote areas. In order to widen the participation in Higher Education (HE) {{there is a need for}} more flexible delivery and study of courses to satisfy the needs of this wider audience. The lack of physical connectivity or telecommunications infrastructure and the cost and lack of broadband technologies are a big hindrance to more widespread participation of people in HE.

40|$|Centralized {{light source}} (CLS) {{at the central}} office is an {{attractive}} solution for low-cost implementation of WDM-PON, as it eliminates the need of wavelength-specific transmitters and wavelength management at the optical network units (ONU). CLS can be realized by either a carrier-distributed scheme or a remodulation scheme. In both schemes, however, the upstream signal is susceptible to the interferometric crosstalk induced by the beating between the upstream signal and the back-reflected light due to the intrinsic Rayleigh Backscattering (RB), {{both of which are}} of the same wavelength. We propose and demonstrate a simple and novel scheme to suppress the RB noise in the carrier-distributed WDM-PON. Differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) is used as the upstream modulation format and the destructive port of the delay-interferometer (DI) is employed to demodulate the upstream DPSK signal. As the spectrum of RB towards the OLT is narrow due to the very narrow spectrum of the distributed carrier, the RB noise can be considerably rejected by the notch filter-like destructive port of the DI at the OLT, which is used simultaneously to demodulate the upstream DPSK signal. The scheme can also be extended to the application in the remodulation-based WDM-PON, as long as the downstream signal has a narrow spectrum (i. e. via reducing downstream modulation depth). A unique feature of the DPSK signal with reduced modulation depth (RMD-DPSK) is that it can be demodulated by DI's destructive port without extinction ratio (ER) degradation, whereas the demodulated signal from DI's destructive port has a very low ER and can be used as the source for upstream remodulation. We also proposed a novel offset-Manchester coding to suppress Rayleigh noise in electrical domain via a postdetection high-pass filter. Foreseeing the rapidly growing demand for multimedia services and the trend of service convergence, the penetration of optical fiber in access network is an ultimate solution to break the last-mile bottleneck imposed by the 100 -year-old copper network. One of the most promising solutions to realize optical access is the passive optical network (PON), in which the network infrastructure is shared by many subscribers and has no active elements between the central office and the customer. Thus a PON requires neither electrical power nor active management, leading to effective reduction in operational expenses. Time-division-multiplexed passive optical networks (TDM-PONs) such as Ethernet PON (EPON) and Gigabit PON (GPON) are being widely deployed in current fiber-based access networks for providing broadband <b>access,</b> <b>offering</b> triple-play services including video, data and voice. In the near future, wavelength-division-multiplexed passive optical network (WDM-PON) can be the enabler of the next-generation optical broadband access that requires large dedicated and symmetric bandwidth, data privacy, and upgrade flexibility. TDM-PONs also can benefit from WDM technologies for capacity upgrade. With more diverse multimedia and data services available for broadband access, the access network has to be flexible enough to cope with various data or video delivery such as broadcast/multicast services, in addition to the point-to-point traffic. Multicast is more attractive, compared to broadcast, as it allows selective control of the connection for each subscriber individually. Multicast can be easily realized in TDM-PONs as it employs power-splitting at the remote node (RN). However, it is more challenging in WDM-PONs, due to the dedicated connection between the optical line terminal (OLT) and each ONU. Many studies have been carried out to solve this problem. The prior schemes either need relatively complicated multicast control and/or cannot support future proof 10 -Gb/s symmetric point-to-point (PtP) transmission. We proposed a novel multicast control scheme for a WDM-PON with 10 -Gb/s symmetric bit rate. The multicast data encoded in DPSK format is superimposed onto all PtP channels modulated in inverse return-to-zero format. With an athermal Dr being used at the ONU to demodulate the DPSK signal, the multicast data can be effectively disabled by slight detuning the laser wavelength at OLT, which has negligible effect on the PtP data. The proposed scheme differs from all the previous schemes in that, the multicast control is realized via the inherent wavelength management of WDM systems, rather than via any other additional adjustment such as ER, synchronization, and polarization. vXu, Jing.
