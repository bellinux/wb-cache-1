5000|$|The word ‘Tuhao’ {{has gone}} viral {{recently}} since its first appearance {{as a joke}} on the Chinese social platform Weibo in 2013: A young man asks a Buddhist monk, ‘I'm wealthy, but unhappy. What should I do?’ The Buddhist monk says, [...] "Define 'wealthy.' [...] " [...] The young man answers, ‘I have millions in the bank and three apartments in central Beijing. Is that wealthy?’ The Buddhist monk silently holds out a hand. The young man says: ‘Master, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I should be thankful and give back?’ Instead of telling him to live a simple and happy life, the Buddhist monk replied ‘Tuhao, let’s be friends!” The joke implies that the tuhao’s wealth was so substantial that it even made a Buddhist monk greedy.|$|E

A Model of the Social Function 2 In an effort to stimulate and guide empirical work within a functional framework. this paper provides a {{conceptual model}} of the social functions of autobiographical memory (AM) across the lifespan. The model delineates the processes and variables involved when AMs are shared to serve social functions. Components of the model include: lifespan contextual influences, the qualitative characteristics of memory (emotionality and level of detail recalled), the speaker’s characteristics (age, gender, and personality), the familiarity and similarity of the listener to the speaker, the level of responsiveness during the memory sharing process, {{and the nature of}} the social relationship in which the memory sharing occurs (valence and length of the relationship). These components are shown to influence the type of social function served and, or, the extent to which social functions are served. Directions for future empirical work to substantiate the model and hypotheses derived from the model are provided...|$|E
