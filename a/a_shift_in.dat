5|$|Although Coming Up to Breathe {{possesses}} {{an overall}} heavier tone than MercyMe's previous albums, {{it has been}} described as an extension or <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> presentation rather than a total departure.

25|$|Certain sound changes {{relate to}} diphthongs and monophthongs. Vowel {{breaking}} or diphthongization is <b>a</b> vowel <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> which <b>a</b> monophthong becomes a diphthong.

50|$|A sigmatropic {{rearrangement}} is {{a reaction}} {{in which a}} sigma bond moves across a conjugated pi system with <b>a</b> concomitant <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> the pi bonds. The <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> the sigma bond may be antarafacial or suprafacial. In the example of <b>a</b> 1,5 <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> pentadiene, if there is <b>a</b> suprafacial <b>shift,</b> there is 6 e− moving suprafacially and none moving antarafacially, implying this reaction is allowed by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules. For <b>an</b> antarafacial <b>shift,</b> the reaction is not allowed.|$|R

5|$|Another {{factor that}} helped Tchaikovsky's music become popular was <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> {{attitude}} among Russian audiences. Whereas {{they had previously}} been satisfied with flashy virtuoso performances of technically demanding but musically lightweight compositions, they gradually began listening with increasing appreciation of the music itself. Tchaikovsky's works were performed frequently, with few delays between their composition and first performances; the publication from 1867 onward of his songs and great piano music for the home market also helped boost the composer's popularity.|$|E
5|$|Cluj-Napoca has {{a diverse}} and growing {{cultural}} scene, with cultural life exhibited {{in a number}} of fields, including the visual arts, performing arts and nightlife. The city's cultural scene spans its history, dating back to Roman times: the city started to be built in that period, which has left its mark on the urban layout (centered on today's Piața Muzeului) as well as surviving ruins. However, the medieval town saw <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> its centre towards new civil and religious structures, notably St. Michael's Church.|$|E

They find <b>a</b> significant outward <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> the euro area Beveridge curve during the Great Recession, but there is considerable heterogeneity at the country level. For example, there is <b>an</b> outward <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> the Beveridge curve for Spain and France and <b>an</b> inward <b>shift</b> for Germany. <b>In</b> case of Greece, there is some evidence of <b>an</b> outward <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> the Beveridge curve during the recent crisis.|$|R
5|$|Gilruth asked Jeannette {{to work as}} a {{consultant}} at NASA. She accepted and lived in a house in Houston she shared with another woman. Jeannette spoke to the scientific community and to the public at NASA about the space program from 1964 to 1970, when Project Apollo was created and Apollo 11 made the first manned Moon landing in 1969. Gilruth then noticed <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> her interests, away from space and towards religion.|$|E
5|$|Holloway's family, however, {{took the}} {{opposite}} approach and criticized the lessening of coverage of her disappearance due to <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> news priority when Hurricane Katrina struck on August 23, 2005.

5|$|However, {{adaptation}} {{to climate change}} has been demonstrated in many cases. These are usually due to <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> coral and zooxanthellae genotypes. These shifts in allele frequency have progressed toward more tolerant types of zooxanthellae. Scientists found that a certain scleractinian zooxanthella is becoming more common where sea temperature is high. Symbionts able to tolerate warmer water seem to photosynthesise more slowly, implying an evolutionary trade-off.|$|E

It appears to be a {{culmination}} of portraits of the Roulin family completed in Arles between November and December. The portraits show <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> style from the fluid, restrained brushstrokes and even surface of Portrait of the Postman to the frenetic style, rough surface, broad brushstrokes and use of a palette knife in Madame Roulin with Baby.|$|E

Throughout ontogeny, the skull of Majungasaurus (more specifically, the jugal, postorbital, and quadratojugal) seems to have become taller and more robust; additionally, the skull bones became more fused and the eye sockets became proportionally smaller. This indicates <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> dietary preferences between juveniles and adults.|$|E

While Neto did support the FNLC, the MPLA government's support came in response to Mobutu's continued support for Angola's FNLA The Carter Administration, unconvinced of Cuban involvement, responded by offering a meager $15million-worth of non-military aid. American timidity during the war prompted <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> Zaire's foreign policy towards greater engagement with France, which became Zaire's largest supplier of arms after the intervention. Neto and Mobutu signed a border agreement on 22 July 1977.|$|E

In the other two examples, both men are not only portraying the idea of feminine touch but the concept of self-touch as well.|$|E
