In 2012, about 24.1 percent of the population was over 65, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> is projected to rise to almost 40 percent by 2050.|$|E
5|$|Typical {{adult male}} ruffs start to moult {{into the main}} display plumage before their return to the {{breeding}} areas, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> of birds with head and neck decorations gradually increases through the spring. Second-year birds lag behind full adults in developing breeding plumage. They have a lower body mass and a slower weight increase than full adults, and perhaps the demands made on their energy reserves during the migration flight are the main reason of the delayed moult.|$|E

The city's religious profile is highly diverse, however: outside London, Birmingham has the United Kingdom's largest Muslim, Sikh and Buddhist communities; its second largest Hindu community; and its seventh largest Jewish community. Between the 2001 and 2011 censuses, the proportion of Christians in Birmingham decreased from 59.1% to 46.1%, while the proportion of Muslims increased from 14.3% to 21.8% <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> of people with no religious affiliation increased from 12.4% to 19.3%.

5|$|Australias ship's {{company had}} {{consistently}} suffered from low morale since the battlecruiser entered service, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> of Australias sailors who {{were placed on}} disciplinary charges during World War I was {{among the highest in}} the RAN. Many of the Australian sailors were chafing under the severity of naval discipline and what they saw as excessive punishment for minor breaches; one example was of a sailor who was charged with desertion, imprisoned for three months, and lost all pay for staying out too late on Armistice Day. Factors which contributed to low morale and poor discipline included frustration at not participating in the Battle of Jutland, high rates of illness, limited opportunities for leave, delays or complete lack of deferred pay, and poor-quality food. The continuation of strict wartime routines and discipline after the armistice frustrated the ship's crew. There was also the perception that Australias British personnel were being promoted faster than their Australian counterparts and were dominating leadership positions. The battlecruiser's arrival in Fremantle on 28 May was met with extensive hospitality, which was reciprocated where possible by the sailors with invitations and tours of their vessel. There were opportunities for shore leave, but these were limited as Australia was only in port for three days, and had to sail early on 1 June for Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|Between 1900 and the 1930s, {{the number}} of runs scored by batsmen, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> of lbw dismissals, {{continued}} to rise. Bowlers grew increasingly frustrated with pad-play {{and the extent to}} which batsmen refused to play shots at bowling directed outside the off stump, simply allowing it to pass by. The English fast bowler Harold Larwood responded by targeting leg stump, frequently hitting the batsman with the ball in the process. This developed into the controversial Bodyline tactics he used in Australia in 1932–33. Some batsmen began to go further and preferred to kick away balls pitched outside off stump—reaching out to kick the ball instead of allowing it to hit their pads—if they presented any threat, knowing that they could not be dismissed lbw. The authorities believed these developments represented poor entertainment value. At the height of the Bodyline controversy in 1933, Donald Bradman, the leading Australian batsman and primary target of the English bowlers, wrote to the MCC recommending an alteration of the lbw law to create more exciting games.|$|E
5|$|The great {{majority}} of Australian aircrew in Bomber Command were graduates of the Empire Air Training Scheme. These men were not concentrated in Australian units, and were instead often posted to the Commonwealth squadron with the greatest need for personnel where they became part of a multi-national bomber crew. Five Australian heavy bomber squadrons (No.460, No.462, No.463, No.466 and No.467squadrons) were formed within Bomber Command between 1941 and 1945, however, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> of Australians in these units increased over time. No.464Squadron, which was equipped with light bombers, was also formed as part of Bomber Command but {{was transferred to the}} Second Tactical Air Force in June 1943 where it continued to attack targets in Europe. Unlike Canada, which concentrated its heavy bomber squadrons into No.6Group RCAF in 1943, the RAAF squadrons in Bomber Command were always part of British units, and the Australian Government had little control over how they were used.|$|E

Yarralumla residents had a median age of 49, compared to a Canberra average of 35.
