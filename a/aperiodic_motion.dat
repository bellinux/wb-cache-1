40|$|We {{investigate}} the quantum versus classical dynamics of a microwave cavity-coupled-Cooper pair transistor (CPT) system, where an applied dc bias causes {{the system to}} self-oscillate via the ac Josephson effect. Varying the dc bias allows the self-oscillation frequency to be tuned. An unusual feature of the system design is that the dc bias does not significantly affect the high quality factor of the cavity mode to which the CPT predominantly couples. The CPT-cavity mode system has a mechanical analogue involving a driven coupled pendulum-oscillator system. The corresponding, nonlinear classical dynamical equations exhibit chaotic, as well as <b>aperiodic</b> <b>motions</b> depending on the initial conditions and the nature and strengths of the damping/noise forces.

The system was originally used, considering a sinusoidal vibration, to illustrate period doubling and the route to chaos. Our experimental device makes it possible to impose, to the plate, arbitrary trajectories and not only sinusoidal or random, as is generally the case. We show that the entire trajectory of the ball can still be reconstructed from the measurement of the collisions times. First, we make use of the experimental system to introduce the notion of dissipative collisions and to propose three different ways to measure the associated restitution coefficient. Then, we report on correlations in the chaotic regime and discuss theoretically the complex pattern which they exhibit in the case of a sinusoidal vibration.

Although integrable in principle, test particle orbits in the Kerr spacetime can also be elaborate, and while they have been studied extensively, classifying their general properties has been a challenge.

A remarkable implication of this periodic orbit taxonomy is that the simple precessing ellipse familiar from planetary orbits is not allowed in the strong-field regime. Instead, eccentric orbits trace out precessions of multi-leaf clovers in the final stages of inspiral. Furthermore, for any black hole, there is some point in the strong-field regime past which zoom-whirl behavior becomes unavoidable.

40|$|Rigid {{splitter}} {{plates in}} the wake of bluff bodies are known to suppress the primary vortex shedding. In the present work, we experimentally study the problem of a flexible splitter plate {{in the wake}} of a circular cylinder. In this case, the splitter plate is free to continuously deform along its length due to the fluid forces acting on it; the flexural rigidity (EI) of the plate being an important parameter. Direct visualizations of the splitter plate motions, for very low values of flexural rigidity (EI), indicate periodic traveling wave type deformations of the splitter plate with maximum tip amplitudes of the order of I cylinder diameter. As the Reynolds number based on cylinder diameter is varied, two regimes of periodic splitter plate motions are found that are referred to as mode I and mode II, with a regime of <b>aperiodic</b> <b>motions</b> between them. The frequency of plate motions in both periodic modes is found to be close to the plane cylinder Strouhal number of about 0. 2, while the average frequencies in the non-periodic regime are substantially lower. The measured normalized phase speed of the traveling wave for both periodic modes is also close to the convection speed of vortices in the plane cylinder wake. As the flexural rigidity of the plate (EI) is increased, the response of the plate was found to shift to the right when plotted with flow speed or Re. To better capture the effect of varying EI, we define and use a non-dimensional bending stiffness, K*, similar to the ones used in the flag flutter problem, K*=EI/(0. 5 rho(UL 3) -L- 2), where U is the free-stream velocity and L is the splitter plate length. Amplitude data for different EI cases when plotted against this parameter appear to collapse on to a single curve for a given splitter plate length.

In this regard, this study is principally focused on studying the evaporation process relevant to thermo-acoustic instability from three complementary viewpoints in an effort to contribute to an overall instability model driven primarily by evaporation in gas turbine combustors. Firstly, a state of the art LES algorithm is employed to validate an evaporation model to be employed in predictive modelling regarding combustion instabilities. Good agreement between the numerical predictions and experimental data is achieved. Additionally, transient sub-critical droplet evaporation is investigated numerically. In particular, a numerical method is proposed to capture the extremely important pressure-velocity-density coupling. Furthermore, the dynamic system nonlinear behaviour encountered in classical thermo-acoustic instability is investigated. The Poincaré map is adopted to analyse the stability of a simple non-autonomous system considering a harmonic oscillation behaviour for the combustion environment. The bifurcation diagram of a one-mode model is obtained where the analysis reveals a variety of chaotic behaviours for some select ranges of the bifurcation parameter. The bifurcation parameter and the corresponding period of a two-mode dynamic model are calculated using both analytical and numerical methods. The results computed by different methods are in good agreement. In addition, the dependence of the bifurcation parameter and the period on all the relevant coefficients in the model is investigated in depth. Moreover, a discrete dynamic model accounting for both combustion and vaporization processes is developed. In terms of different bifurcation parameters relevant to either combustion or evaporation, various bifurcation diagrams are presented. As part of the nonlinear characterization, the governing process Lyapunov exponent is calculated and employed to analyze the stability of the particular dynamic system. The study has shown conclusively that the evaporation process has {{a significant impact on the}} intensity and nonlinear behaviour of the system of interest, vis-à-vis a model accounting for only the gaseous combustion process. Furthermore, two particular nonlinear control methodologies are adopted to control the chaotic behaviour displayed by the particular <b>aperiodic</b> <b>motions</b> observed. These algorithms are intended to be implemented for control of combustion instability numerically and experimentally to provide a rational basis for some of the control methodologies employed in the literature. Finally, a state of the art neural network is employed to identify and predict the nonlinear behaviour inherent in combustion instability, and control the ensuing pressure oscillations. Essentially, the NARMAX model is implemented to capture nonlinear dynamics relating the input and output of the system of interest. The simulated results accord with the results reported. Moreover, a control system using the NARMA-L 2 algorithm is developed. The simulation conclusively points to the fact that the amplitude of pressure oscillations can be attenuated to an acceptable level and the controller proposed may be implemented in a practical manner.

This system consists of a turbine rotor, generator, flywheel with mass eccentricity, and a squeezed film damper. The turbine and generator are connected by a coupling which is regarded as rigid.

Stellar mass compact objects spiraling into supermassive black holes have received particular attention as sources of gravitational waves detectable by space-based gravitational wave observatories. A well-established approach models such an extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRI) as an adiabatic progression {{through a series of}} Kerr geodesics. Thus, the direct detection of gravitational radiation from EMRIs and the extraction of astrophysical information from those waveforms require a thorough knowledge of the underlying geodesic dynamics. This dissertation adopts a dynamical systems approach to the study of Kerr orbits, beginning with equatorial orbits. We deduce a topological taxonomy of orbits that hinges on a correspondence between periodic orbits and rational numbers.

This review aims to summarise {{the wide variety of}} motion correction techniques available in PET and combined PET/CT and PET/MR, with a focus on the latter. A general framework for the motion correction of PET images is presented, consisting of acquisition, modelling and correction stages. Methods for measuring, modelling and correcting motion and associated artefacts, both in literature and commercially available, are presented, and their relative merits are contrasted. Identified limitations of current methods include modelling of <b>aperiodic</b> and/or unpredictable <b>motion,</b> attaining adequate temporal resolution for motion correction in dynamic kinetic modelling acquisitions, and maintaining availability of the MR in PET/MR scans for diagnostic acquisitions. Finally, avenues for future investigation are discussed, with a focus on improvements that could improve PET image quality, and that are practical in the clinical environment.

40|$|Recognition of {{biological}} motion is pervasive in early child development. Further, viewing the movement behavior of others {{is a primary}} component of a child’s acquisition of complex, robust movement repertoires, through imitation and real-time coordinated action. We theorize that inherent to biological movements are particular qualities of mathematical chaos and complexity. We further posit that this character affords the rich and complex inter-dynamics throughout early motor development. Specifically, we explored whether children’s preference for biological motion {{may be related to}} an affinity for mathematical chaos. Cross Recurrence Quantification Analysis (cRQA) was used to investigate the coordination of gaze and posture with various temporal structures (periodic, chaotic, and <b>aperiodic)</b> of the <b>motion</b> of an oscillating visual stimulus. Children appear to competently perceive and respond to chaotic motion, both in rate (cRQA-percent determinism) and duration (cRQA-maxline) of coordination. We interpret this to indicate that children not only recognize chaotic motion structures, but also have a preference for coordination with them. Further, stratification of our sample (by age) uncovers the suggestion that this preference may become refined with age...|$|R
40|$|The {{understanding}} and the complete {{description of the}} glass transition are impeded by the complexity of nature of the glass. Parts of this complexity come from the emergence of long-lived inherent structures of a liquid at a temperature below which the activated reconfiguration events play a dominant role. Molecules in a glass change their locations through the activated process at a rate which varies throughout the glass owing to these local and <b>aperiodic</b> structures. <b>Motions</b> in one location also cause or relieve constrains, thereby altering the rate of transitions of neighboring regions. The key to understanding this problem is the interplay between the activated events that generate mobility and the transport of mobility. In the following we explore fluctuating mobility generation and transport in glasses to understand {{the dynamics of the}} glassy state {{within the framework of the}} random first order transition theory of glass. Fluctuating mobility generation and transport in the glass that arise from there being a distribution of local stability and thus effective temperature are treated by numerically solving stochastic continuum equations for mobility and fictive temperature fields. Fluctuating spatiotemporal structures in aging and rejuvenating glasses lead to dynamical heterogeneity in glasses with characteristics that are distinct from those found in the equilibrium liquid. We illustrate in this thesis how the heterogeneity in glasses gives rises of a non-Gaussian distribution of activation free energies, the stretching exponent, and the growth of characteristic lengths. These are studied along with the four-point dynamic correlation function. Asymmetric thermodynamic responses upon heating and cooling are also predicted to be the results of the heterogeneity and the out-of-equilibrium behavior of glasses below the glass transition temperature. Moreover the dynamical heterogeneity can lead to a growth front of mobility in rejuvenating glasses that emanates from the surface where stable glasses are heated. Noticeably bimodal distributions of local fictive temperatures in aging glasses are also investigate. This result explains recent experimental observations that have been interpreted as coming from these being two distinct equilibration mechanisms in glasses. Finally we study the mechanical properties of glasses. The remarkable strength of glasses is examined using the random first order transition theory. The theory predicts that the strength not only depends on the elastic modulus but also depends on the amount of configurational energy frozen in when the glass is prepared. The stress catalysis of cooperative rearrangements of the same type as those responsible for the supercooled liquid's high viscosity account quantitatively for the measured strength of a range of metallic glasses, silica and a polymer glass...|$|R
