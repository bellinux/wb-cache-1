5|$|Benefits Street is a British {{documentary}} series broadcast on Channel 4. It was first aired on 6 January 2014, {{and ran for}} five episodes. The show was filmed by documenting the lives of several residents of James Turner Street, Winson Green, Birmingham, England, United Kingdom, where newspapers including the Daily Mail and The Guardian reported that 90% of the residents claim benefits. It shows benefits claimants committing crimes, including a demonstration of how to shoplift, and portrays <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> people are dependent on welfare payments and lack the motivation to seek employment.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of supply—let me {{deal with it}} this way. I generally believe if a government is elected to power in the lower House and has the numbers and can maintain the numbers in the lower House, it is entitled to expect that it will govern for the three-year term unless quite extraordinary events intervene... Having said that... if we do make up our minds at some stage that the Government is so reprehensible that an Opposition must use whatever power is available to it, then I'd want to find <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Mr. Whitlam {{woke up one morning}} finding the decision had been made and finding that he had been caught with his pants well and truly down.|$|E
5|$|For decades, {{research}} on the Polish Underground State was restricted, largely because the communist People's Republic of Poland {{did not wish to}} fully acknowledge the role of the non-communist resistance. During the first postwar Stalinist years, efforts to explore this topic were regarded as dangerous, bordering on illegal. Research into the events occurring in the Soviet-annexed territories in the 1939–1941 period was particularly difficult. The limited research devoted to the Underground State that did take place was done mainly by Polish émigré historians living in the West. The communist state downplayed the importance of the non-communist resistance movements, while the communist movement (Armia Ludowa) was emphasized as being of primary importance; in fact, the opposite was true. The absence of research by Polish scholars, along with obstacles presented to foreign scholars seeking access to source material in communist Poland, contributed to <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> there was virtually no discussion by Western scholars of one of Europe's largest resistance movements—the non-communist Polish resistance movement. The bulk of Western research centred on the much smaller French Resistance (la Résistance).|$|E

5|$|The idea of {{chemical}} chain reactions was first suggested in 1913 by the German chemist Max Bodenstein for <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> two molecules {{react to form}} not just the final reaction products, but also some unstable molecules which can further react with the original substances to cause more to react. The concept of a nuclear chain reaction was first hypothesized by the Hungarian scientist Leo Szilard on 12 September 1933. Szilard realized that if a nuclear reaction produced neutrons or dineutrons, which then caused further nuclear reactions, the process might be self-perpetuating. Szilard proposed using mixtures of lighter known isotopes which produced neutrons in copious amounts, although he did entertain {{the possibility of using}} uranium as a fuel. He filed a patent for his idea of a simple nuclear reactor the following year. The discovery of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, followed by its theoretical explanation (and naming) by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, opened up the possibility of creating a nuclear chain reaction with uranium or indium, but initial experiments were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} Bastille as {{a prison}} changed {{considerably}} during the reigns of Louis XV and XVI. One trend was {{a decline in the}} number of prisoners sent to the Bastille, with only 1,194 imprisoned there during the reign of Louis XV and only 306 under Louis XVI up until the Revolution, annual averages of around 23 and 20 respectively. A second trend was a slow shift away from the Bastille's 17th-century role of detaining primarily upper-class prisoners, towards <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the Bastille was essentially a location for imprisoning socially undesirable individuals of all backgrounds – including aristocrats breaking social conventions, criminals, pornographers, thugs – and was used to support police operations, particularly those involving censorship, across Paris. Despite these changes, the Bastille remained a state prison, subject to special authorities, answering to the monarch of the day and surrounded by a considerable and threatening reputation.|$|E
