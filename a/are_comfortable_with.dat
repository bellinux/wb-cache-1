Typically, the role is filled by a Chaplain or Spiritual Counselor, but social workers or other persons, sometimes specially trained, may also serve. While not every patient will see a Chaplain on hospice, all hospices {{have to be able to}} provide regular and consistent Chaplain services. The Chaplain is available to provide spiritually supportive counseling, life review and may connect a patient with clergy they <b>are</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with.</b> At times the hospice Chaplain will officiate at a patient's funeral.|$|E

25|$|British police <b>are</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> the TPAC, as fleeing {{drivers are}} usually {{considered}} to be unarmed, and driving beside or {{in front of them}} is not a hazard.

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, bullet or slug {{structures}} return the principal to investors {{in a single}} payment. The most common bullet structure is called the soft bullet, meaning that the final bullet payment is not guaranteed to be paid on the scheduled maturity date; however, {{the majority of these}} securitizations are paid on time. The second type of bullet structure is the hard bullet, which guarantees that the principal will be paid on the scheduled maturity date. Hard bullet structures are less common for two reasons: investors <b>are</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> soft bullet structures, and they are reluctant to accept the lower yields of hard bullet securities in exchange for a guarantee.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{transsexual}} people {{undergo a}} physical transition. Some find reasons not to; for example, {{the expense of}} surgery, the risk of medical complications, or medical conditions which make the use of hormones or surgery dangerous. Some may not identify strongly with another binary gender role. Others may find balance at a mid-point during the process, {{regardless of whether or}} not they are binary-identified. Many transsexual people, including binary-identified transsexual people, do not undergo genital surgery, because they <b>are</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> their own genitals, or because they are concerned about nerve damage and the potential loss of sexual pleasure, including orgasm. This is especially so in the case of trans men, many of whom are dissatisfied with the current state of phalloplasty, which is typically very expensive, not covered by health insurance, and commonly does not achieve desired results. For example, not only does phalloplasty not result in a completely natural erection, it may not allow for an erection at all, and its results commonly lack penile sexual sensitivity; in other cases, however, phalloplasty results are satisfying for trans men. By contrast, metoidioplasty, which is more popular, is significantly less expensive and has far better sexual results.|$|E

500|$|The novel explores {{themes of}} {{violence}} and the abuse of power, {{as well as of}} coming of age.

It has been described as sharing themes of dreamworlds and choices with a number of other works by Le Guin, such as the Earthsea cycle, The Beginning Place, and [...] "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas". It also shares similarities with Maurice Sendak's book Where the Wild Things Are, while Orrec's transformation in the novel has been compared to the biblical story of Jonah.|$|E

[...] Augusta National chairman Hootie Johnson was unperturbed, stating, [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> {{what we are doing}} with the golf course."

[...] The single [...] "We Need a Resolution" [...] was argued to have transformed [...] "the once tomboy into a sexy grown woman".

Other artists, having playing Guitar Hero or Rock Band, may approach the game developers to ask for inclusion of songs specifically for their adaptability into playable tracks. However, not all bands <b>are</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> this: Led Zeppelin has turned down offers from both games to include their music due to concerns that Jimmy Page {{and other members of the}} band have with releasing the master recordings of their music. [...] There are also cases where bands want to be included, but the master recordings have been lost or are unusable. Some bands such as the Sex Pistols, Living Colour, and Aerosmith have rerecorded these songs, while other bands have been able to provide concert [...] "live" [...] master recordings. [...] However, some larger artists are unable to do so. [...] Neversoft director Brian Bright states that they do not expect to acquire songs from Pink Floyd and Prince due to such reasons. [...] With the pending release of The Beatles: Rock Band, Pink Floyd is also in active discussions to include its music in either Guitar Hero or Rock Band, according to representatives for EMI.|$|E

Some criticism has been made of the survey. 41% of respondents said they knew little or nothing about the project and there is no reporting as to how people who knew about the project responded as opposed to those who didn't. The under-representation of people under 40 (only 95 people surveyed with only 30 of those saying they knew about the project) affects the reliability.
