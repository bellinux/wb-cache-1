Phillipps used traits from his own personality to flesh out the character. Daniel came to Erinsborough to see where his parents fell in love and decided to stay for his uncle. Phillipps stated that Paul and Daniel have <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>relationship,</b> as they both want to be good influences on each other. Daniel's first major storyline was a love triangle involving himself, Amber Turner (Jenna Rosenow) and Josh Willis (Harley Bonner). Amber and Daniel were later engaged. Daniel's past was explored a little further when his ex-girlfriend Rain Taylor (Airlie Dodds) was introduced towards the end of 2014. The character has also formed a relationship with Imogen Willis (Ariel Kaplan) and been manipulated by Dakota Davies (Sheree Murphy). Daniel's personality also changed, as he became more ruthless and career driven. The character has received mixed reviews from critics.|$|E

30|$|In this study, craniofacial {{fractures}} {{were relatively}} prominent among males aged 10 to 39  years. The present {{findings indicated that}} <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> emergency room workforce is necessary during the middle 10  days of a month. The midfacial area, which had a relatively high proportion of facial fractures, should be preferentially evaluated. Excluding patients with nasal bone fractures, {{nearly half of the}} patients in the present study had experienced multiple fractures. Nasal bone fractures had <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>relationship</b> with sports than with other causes of fracture; therefore, it is necessary to protect the nasal area during sports activities. Furthermore, zygomatic arch and maxillary wall fractures had <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> causal <b>relationship</b> with traffic accidents than with other causes, which should be reflected in improved protective mechanisms for drivers of automobiles. Fractures were associated with alcohol intoxication, especially in cases of personal assault. The last trisection of the month, mandible or panfacial fractures, and traffic accidents were related to a high incidence of postoperative complications. Surgeons should consider these factors when dealing with a craniofacial fracture.|$|R

Furthermore, the findings of the study concur with what was unveiled in the study by Kia et al.

Therefore, it can be asserted that the efficiency of the port in delivering the services is connected with the technology available.|$|R

Chrissie was intended to be a contrast to her predecessor; where Angie turned to alcohol, Chrissie was more Den's [...] "equal" [...] and could be just as devious and calculating, with Oberman observing how [...] "Angie was all knee-jerk reaction, but Chrissie is more of a plotter and schemer – just like Den." [...] Comparing Den's two wives, Oberman remarked: [...] "Chrissie's much cooler than Angie. Her motto is, 'revenge is a dish best served cold'. She's tougher than Angie and she can hold it together much better." [...] Indeed, according to Oberman, producers deliberately wanted to take Den's second marriage down a different path to his first; whereas the relationship between Den and Angie had been likened to Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, that between Den and Chrissie was modelled on Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. Like Den, Chrissie had an acerbic tongue and their relationship was marked by verbal fencing in the manner of Hepburn and Tracy: [...] "What's great is that they've written Den an equal", Oberman noted, [...] "It'll be interesting to see their little sparring matches."

The results showed that basic psychological needs had <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>relationship</b> and prediction capacity of enjoyment and the intention to persist than the level of self-determination. Concretely, the perception of social relationships and competence were the strongest predictors of those two variables. To conclude, we highlight the need to promote satisfaction with basic psychological needs, mainly social relationships and competence, which would lead to stronger feelings of enjoyment and a firmer intention to continue playing sport...|$|R
30|$|Considering that coping {{strategies}} may {{be classified as}} adaptive or maladaptive depending on different factors, there are sufficient empirical evidences that point out which are the most commonly related to emotional distress or well-being. In this vain, Meyer (2001) classified the strategies measured by Brief-COPE in maladaptive coping, which included venting, denial, substance use, behavioral disengagement, self-distraction, and self-blame, and adaptive coping, including positive reframing, planning and seeking social support, active coping, use of emotional and instrumental support, acceptance, religion, and humor. Moreover, Meyer (2001) found that maladaptive strategies have <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>relationship</b> with mental health problems such as depression. On the other hand, adaptive strategies have a stronger relationship with psychological well-being. Accordingly, maladaptive strategies {{have been found to}} be related to perceived stress and adaptive ones to satisfaction with life (Alveal and Barraza, 2015).|$|R
