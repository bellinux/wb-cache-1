5|$|Immediately {{following}} the cyclone's onslaught, concerns arose amongst relief agencies and NGOs that {{the storm was}} either {{too early in the}} season or not damaging enough to dedicate a significant portion of disaster funds. Consequently, disagreements between prospective donors <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> emergency response resulted in delayed intervention. Post-storm assessments of the response to Bonita highlighted the need for increased coordination between agencies.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, American prospectors began to spread into the area. Making deals with the Native Tlingit and Tagish tribes, the early prospectors opened the {{important}} routes of Chilkoot and White Pass, and reached the Yukon valley between 1870 and 1890. Here, they encountered the Hän people, semi-nomadic hunters and fishermen who lived along the Yukon and Klondike Rivers. The Hän did not appear to know <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> the gold deposits in the region.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{public and}} much of the {{military}} command structure were kept in the dark <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> the defeat: Japanese news announced a great victory. Only Emperor Hirohito and the highest Navy command personnel were accurately informed of the carrier and pilot losses. Consequently, even the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) continued to believe, for at least a short time, that the fleet was in good condition.|$|E

5|$|Several {{days after}} the storm, the bodies of {{drowning}} victims had been recovered by the hundreds, and it was suspected many of the deceased had been washed into the sea. One preliminary estimate placed the number of dead in the Jérémie area alone at 1,500, suggesting {{the worst of the}} tragedy occurred there. Indeed, some modern sources have unofficially referred to the storm as Hurricane Jérémie. The Haitian government worked to bring emergency supplies and relief workers, at least partially by way of ship, to the flood-stricken region. As little was known <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> losses, officials rushed to restore communications with the disaster area.|$|E
5|$|Dwight D. Eisenhower {{was elected}} U.S. President in 1952, {{promising}} {{to take a}} harder line against communism; the links that his staff members John Foster Dulles and Allen Dulles had to the UFC also predisposed them to act against the Guatemalan government. Additionally, the U.S. government drew exaggerated conclusions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> communist influence from {{the presence of a}} small number of communists among Árbenz's advisers. Eisenhower authorized the CIA to carry out Operation PBSUCCESS in August 1953. The CIA armed, funded, and trained a force of 480 men led by Carlos Castillo Armas. The coup was preceded by U.S. efforts to criticize and isolate Guatemala internationally. Castillo Armas' force invaded Guatemala on 18 June 1954, backed by a heavy campaign of psychological warfare. This included a radio station which broadcast anti-government propaganda and a version of military events favorable to the rebellion, claiming to be genuine news, as well as bombings of Guatemala City and a naval blockade of Guatemala. The invasion force fared poorly militarily, and most of its offensives were defeated. However, psychological warfare and the possibility of a U.S. invasion intimidated the Guatemalan army, which eventually refused to fight. Árbenz briefly and unsuccessfully attempted to arm civilians to resist the invasion, before resigning on 27 June. Castillo Armas became president ten days later, following negotiations in San Salvador.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{and authors}} {{writing about the}} 1954 coup have debated the {{relative}} importance {{of the role of the}} United Fruit Company and the worries about communist influence (whether or not these were grounded in reality) in the U.S.'s decision to instigate the coup in 1954. Several historians have maintained that the lobbying of the UFC, and the expropriation of its lands, were the chief motivation for the U.S., strengthened by the financial ties of individuals within the Eisenhower administration to the UFC. Others have argued that the overthrow was motivated primarily by U.S. strategic interest; the knowledge of the presence of a small number of communists close to Árbenz led the U.S. to reach incorrect conclusions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> communist influence. Yet others have argued that the overthrow was part of a larger tendency within the U.S. to oppose nationalist movements in the Third World. Both the role of the UFC and that of the perception of communist influence continue to be cited as motivations for the U.S.'s actions today.|$|E
