40|$|Objective: Adipose tissue dysfunction, {{characterized}} by dysregulation of adipokines production and/or secretion, has {{been implicated in}} the pathophysiology of type- 2 diabetes mellitus, a metabolic complication closely related to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Recently, an association between circulating maternal visfatin, a novel adipokine with metabolic and immunoregulatory properties, and impaired glucose metabolism {{as well as with}} altered fetal growth, has been proposed. The aims of this study were to determine whether there is an association between maternal plasma visfatin concentration, GDM, and <b>a</b> large-for-gestational-age (LGA) <b>newborn.</b> // Study design: This cross-sectional study, included pregnant women at term in the following groups: 1) normal pregnancy and an appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) neonate (n= 54); 2) normal pregnancy and <b>an</b> LGA <b>newborn</b> (n= 47); 3) GDM and <b>an</b> AGA <b>newborn</b> (n= 56); 4) GDM and <b>an</b> LGA <b>newborn</b> (n= 45).

Uttar Pradesh contributed to the largest share of almost all communicable and noncommunicable disease deaths, including 48 per cent of all typhoid deaths (2014); 17 per cent of cancer deaths and 18 per cent of tuberculosis deaths (2015). After Assam, Uttar Pradesh has India’s second-highest maternal mortality rate, 285 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births (2013), with 62 percent of pregnant women unable to access minimum ante-natal care.|$|E

5|$|Birth {{usually takes}} place in the water and {{typically}} produces a single pup weighing 1.4 to 2.3kg (3 to 5lb). Twins occur in 2% of births; however, usually only one pup survives. At birth, the eyes are open, ten teeth are visible, and the pup has a thick coat of baby fur. Mothers have been observed to lick and fluff <b>a</b> <b>newborn</b> for hours; after grooming, the pup's fur retains so much air, the pup floats like a cork and cannot dive. The fluffy baby fur is replaced by adult fur after about 13 weeks.|$|E

5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} in <b>a</b> <b>newborn</b> baby are much larger as a {{proportion}} of the body size than in an adult. For example, at age three months the glands are four {{times the size of the}} kidneys. The size of the glands decreases relatively after birth, mainly because of shrinkage of the cortex. The cortex, which almost completely disappears by age 1, develops again from age 4–5. The glands weigh about 1 g at birth and develop to an adult weight of about 4 grams each. In a fetus the glands are first detectable after the sixth week of development.|$|E

5|$|Eleven {{years into}} Sunday's evangelistic career, {{both he and}} his wife had been pushed to their {{emotional}} limits. Long separations had exacerbated his natural feelings of inadequacy and insecurity. As a product of a childhood that could well be described as a series of losses, he was extremely dependent on his wife's love and encouragement. For her part, Nell found it increasingly difficult to handle household responsibilities, the needs of four children (including <b>a</b> <b>newborn),</b> and the long-distance emotional welfare of her husband. His ministry was also expanding, and he needed an administrator, a job for which his wife was ideally suited. In 1908, the Sundays decided to entrust their children to a nanny so that Nell could manage the revival campaigns.|$|E

Van Allen arrives at the church, but is stopped by Reyes. Later, Reyes muses to Scully that in the past, she had always failed to stop Van Allen's spirit.

5|$|Shyamalan and cinematographer Eduardo Serra chose several {{camera angles}} to {{simulate}} {{the look of a}} comic book panel. Various visual narrative motifs were also applied. Several scenes relating to the Mr. Glass character involve glass. As <b>a</b> <b>newborn,</b> he is primarily seen reflected in mirrors, and as a young child, he is seen reflected in a blank TV screen. When he leaves his calling card on the windshield of David Dunn's car, he is reflected in a glass frame in his art gallery. Jackson requested his walking stick be made of glass to make his character more menacing. Using purple as Mr. Glass' color to David Dunn's green was also Jackson's idea. Mr. Glass' wig was modeled after Afro-American statesman Frederick Douglass. As he does in his other films, Shyamalan makes a cameo appearance. He plays a man David suspects of dealing drugs inside the stadium.|$|E

The book also explains how certain creatures of the mythology that were slain by heroes are, apparently, still alive. For example, Zeus recollects that Hercules slew the Hydra, and Athena confirms this, but informs Zeus that the new Hydra is <b>a</b> <b>newborn</b> spawn of the Titans Typhon and Echidna, and was released by Ares.|$|E
5|$|Herpes simplex is a {{viral disease}} {{caused by the}} herpes simplex virus. Infections are {{categorized}} based {{on the part of the}} body infected. Oral herpes involves the face or mouth. It may result in small blisters in groups often called cold sores or fever blisters or may just cause a sore throat. Genital herpes, often simply known as herpes, may have minimal symptoms or form blisters that break open and result in small ulcers. These typically heal over two to four weeks. Tingling or shooting pains may occur before the blisters appear. Herpes cycles between periods of active disease followed by periods without symptoms. The first episode is often more severe and may be associated with fever, muscle pains, swollen lymph nodes and headaches. Over time, episodes of active disease decrease in frequency and severity. Other disorders caused by herpes simplex include: herpetic whitlow when it involves the fingers, herpes of the eye, herpes infection of the brain, and neonatal herpes when it affects <b>a</b> <b>newborn,</b> among others.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} play in the Lancashire League in England during the Australian winter of 1952, joining Nelson Cricket Club for a sum of 600 pounds and bonuses, which did not include the boat fares for him and his wife. Lindwall took 96 wickets at 8.37 during the season and developed an inswinger on the advice of a local umpire who adamantly refused to give leg before wicket decisions to outswingers. Lindwall returned to Australia with <b>a</b> <b>newborn</b> son who has been born during his stay in Lancashire, and he was greeted by media speculation as to whether his professional sojourn had improved or detracted from his capabilities. Lindwall's form leading into the Tests against South Africa in 1952–53 prompted observers to opine that he was bowling better than ever, reinforced with the inswinger and his trademark Yorker. Lindwall made 70 from a total of 148 on a sticky wicket against South Australia in Adelaide that led Miller to regard it as the best innings he had seen under such conditions. He made the score after being sent in to open the batting in the absence of Sid Barnes.|$|E
