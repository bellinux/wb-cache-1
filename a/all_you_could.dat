500|$|When mature, Chicado V stood [...] tall. She was a brown mare, with a {{connected}} star, stripe, and snip on {{her face}} as her only markings, or identifying marks. [...] Earl Holmes, a longtime trainer who started his racing career as a groom for Vessels, had the care of ChicadoV after she was born, and said of her that she [...] "was gentle, real gentle—in everything. She was born broke." [...] When she stood in a starting gate for a race, Holmes said {{she looked like a}} rabbit, because [...] "she had big ears and that's <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> see, she was so little". She also had a body defect, or conformation fault, in that she had calf-knees.|$|E
500|$|Writing for GamePro, Captain Squideo called Destruction Derby [...] "the most raucous racing {{experience}} of the fall". He believed that its [...] "graphics are almost <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> want for a game" [...] of this type, but wrote that [...] "nothing here stands out as graphically spectacular". He complained that the game does not let players customise cars, and he disliked its lack of split-screen multiplayer. He summarised, [...] "Limited options keep Destruction Derby out of the winner's circuit, but this rowdy stock-car racer still generates a stadium full of thrashin' fun." [...] Victor Lucas of The Electric Playground stated that [...] "the beauty of the game" [...] is the strategy involved in making [...] "calculated strikes" [...] against enemy vehicles, and he wrote, [...] "If you go all {{out and try to}} make big noise on the track, more than likely you'll be limping to the scrap yard in seconds." [...] He believed that the game's Stock Car racing mode [...] "is no match for the white knuckle inertia of either Wipeout or Ridge Racer", and that the demolition derbies in The Bowl were [...] "most fun to be had" [...] in the game. He praised the game's graphics and physics, and concluded, [...] "Destruction Derby is a winner in every capacity." [...] A reviewer for Next Generation was extremely pleased with the concept of smashing into other cars, saying it taps into a near-universal fantasy. He remarked the single-player mode is indefinably [...] "lacking" [...] but the multiplayer offers unqualified enjoyment.|$|E
500|$|Skyfall {{received}} [...] "generally positive {{reviews from}} critics and fans", {{according to the}} GlobalPost. Rotten Tomatoes sampled 349 reviewers and judged 93% of the reviews to be positive, while the film scored 81 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 49 reviews, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". A number of critics, including Kate Muir, reviewing for The Times, Philip French, writing in The Observer, IGN's Daniel Krupa and the reviewers for the Irish Independent and the Daily Record, all asked whether Skyfall was the best Bond film produced. The Daily Telegraphs film reviewer, Robbie Collin, considered Skyfall to be [...] "often dazzling, always audacious", with excellent action sequences in a film that contained humour and emotion. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter thought that Skyfall was [...] "dramatically gripping while still brandishing a droll undercurrent of humor", going {{on to say that}} it was a film that had [...] "some weight and complexity to it". Variety Peter DeBruge suggested that the film's greatest strength lay in its willingness to put as much focus on characterisation as it did action set-pieces, allowing the two to co-exist rather than compete for the audience's attention, while Manohla Dargis, reviewing for The New York Times, considered Skyfall to be [...] "a superior follow-up to Casino Royale" [...] which is [...] "opulent rather than outlandish and insistently, progressively low-key". Kim Newman, reviewing the film for Empire, concluded, [...] "Skyfall is pretty much <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> want from a 21st Century Bond: cool but not camp, respectful of tradition but up to the moment, serious in its thrills and relatively complex in its characters but with the sense of fun that hasn't always been evident lately". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, describing it as [...] "a full-blooded, joyous, intelligent celebration of a beloved cultural icon". Reviewing for the New Statesman, Ryan Gilbey saw that [...] "nostalgia permeates the movie", going on to say that [...] "sometimes the old ways are the best".|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the most}} memorable things Saltzman absorbed during his conversations and life-changing stay with The Beatles was George Harrison's words: [...] "Like we're The Beatles, after all, aren't we? We have <b>all</b> the money <b>you</b> <b>could</b> ever dream of, we have <b>all</b> the fame <b>you</b> <b>could</b> ever wish for. But it isn't love. It isn't health.

France Dimanche said the [...] "groans, sighs, and Bardot's little cries of pleasure [...] the impression you're listening to two people making love". The first time Gainsbourg played it in public was in a Paris restaurant immediately after they recorded it. Birkin said that [...] "as it began to play <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> hear were the knives and forks being put down. 'I think we have a hit record', he said." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{graduating from}} Sharon High School in May 1936, Graham {{attended}} Bob Jones College, then located in Cleveland, Tennessee. After one semester, {{he found it}} too legalistic in both coursework and rules. At {{this time he was}} influenced and inspired by Pastor Charley Young from Eastport Bible Church. He was almost expelled, but Bob Jones Sr. warned him not to throw his life away: [...] "At best, <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> amount to would be a poor country Baptist preacher somewhere out in the sticks....

2500|$|In 2011, the National Security Archive, in {{accordance}} with the Freedom of Information Act, released over 1200 pages of documents. One detail within these documents was incidents of friendly fire. The CIA had outfitted some B-26 bombers to appear as Cuban aircraft, having ordered them to remain inland to avoid being fired upon by American-backed forces. Some of the planes did not heed the warning, and were fired upon. According to CIA operative Grayston Lynch, “we couldn’t tell them from the Castro planes. We ended up shooting at two or three of them. We hit some of them there because when they came at us…it was a silhouette, that was <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> see.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Property {{damage was}} {{particularly}} severe: Allan Andreson, a CBC reporter, described that the [...] "marsh {{was just like}} one vast lake. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> see in the distance {{sticking out of the}} water was the steeple of the Springdale Christian Reformed Church." [...] Highway 400, which bisects the marsh, was under five to ten feet [...] of water. The majority of the properties in the marsh were inundated with water, and homes and their contents were either seriously damaged or completely destroyed. Many of these houses were contaminated by the flood, or the rotting vegetables (the crop was recently harvested), and became unfit for habitation. A few homes were taken off their foundations by the waters and floated around the marsh; one, the DePeuter residence, which contained the parents, twelve children and a cat, spent the night floating on the marsh for [...] As a result of the flooding, 3000 people were left homeless as [...] of the marsh became a lake.|$|E
2500|$|Here, the people-seeds {{flying through}} the window {{represent}} conception, despite the precautionary mesh screen, which functions as contraception. The woman does not want a people-seed to root itself in her house, and so she even takes the measure to protect herself with the best mesh screens, and then voluntarily opens the windows. However, {{in the event that}} one people-seed finds its way through her window screens, unwelcome as it may be, does the simple fact that the woman knowingly risked such an occurrence when opening her window deny her the ability to rid her house of the intruder? [...] Thomson notes that some may argue the affirmative to this question, claiming that [...] "...after <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have lived out your life with bare floors and furniture, or with sealed windows and doors". But by this logic, she says, any woman could avoid pregnancy due to rape by simply having a hysterectomy – an extreme procedure simply to safeguard against such a possibility. [...] Thomson concludes that although there may be times when the fetus does have a right to the mother's body, certainly in most cases the fetus does not have a right to the mother's body. This analogy raises the issue of whether all abortions are unjust killing.|$|E
