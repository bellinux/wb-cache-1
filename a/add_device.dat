40|$|Self-assembly or {{bottom-up}} techniques {{based on}} molecular recognition are attracting {{a great deal}} of interest for nanofabrication. One such technology is based on the use of self-assembling tecto-RNA that {{has been shown to be}} able to make structures with nanoscale features (&# 60; 10  nm) over large areas of the order of several microns. The technique is extremely flexible in that different RNA designs can be used to create dramatically different patterns, and the technology has the potential to scale up so that it might be used to pattern whole chips, or even wafers. In a step towards using molecular recognition techniques to build devices such as electronic circuits or sensors it is necessary to be able to <b>add</b> <b>device</b> structures or link functional units together. The authors show that the tecto-RNA method can be extended to attach gold nanoparticles using DNA linkers. The self-assembling properties of the RNA can in turn be used to link together the gold nanoparticles to form wires and clusters in a Mg 2 + -ion controlled, as opposed to electrostatically aggregated, process. Using this method they have fabricated a gold nanoparticle wire between two nanoelectrodes and evaluated the electrical properties of the resultant device...|$|E
40|$|This manual {{describes}} {{the use of}} the Xyce Parallel Electronic Simulator code for simulating electrical circuits at a variety of abstraction levels. The Xyce Parallel Electronic Simulator has been written to support,in a rigorous manner, the simulation needs of the Sandia National Laboratories electrical designers. As such, the development has focused on improving the capability over the current state-of-the-art in the following areas: (1) Capability to solve extremely large circuit problems by supporting large-scale parallel computing platforms (up to thousands of processors). Note that this includes support for most popular parallel and serial computers. (2) Improved performance for all numerical kernels (e. g., time integrator, nonlinear and linear solvers) through state-of-the-art algorithms and novel techniques. (3) A client-server or multi-tiered operating model wherein the numerical kernel can operate independently of the graphical user interface (GUI). (4) Object-oriented code design and implementation using modern coding-practices that ensure that the Xyce Parallel Electronic Simulator will be maintainable and extensible far into the future. The code is a parallel code in the most general sense of the phrase [...] a message passing parallel implementation [...] which allows it to run efficiently on the widest possible number of computing platforms. These include serial, shared-memory and distributed-memory parallel as well as heterogeneous platforms. Furthermore, careful {{attention has been paid to}} the specific nature of circuit-simulation problems to ensure that optimal parallel efficiency is achieved even as the number of processors grows. Another feature required by designers is the ability to <b>add</b> <b>device</b> models, many specific to the needs of Sandia, to the code. To this end, the device package in the Xyce Parallel Electronic Simulator is designed to support a variety of device model inputs. These input formats include standard analytical models, behavioral models and look-up tables. Combined with this flexible interface is an architectural design that greatly simplifies the addition of circuit models. One of the most important contribution Xyce makes to the designers at Sandia National Laboratories is in providing a platform for computational research and development aimed specifically at the needs of the Laboratory. With Xyce, Sandia now has an ''in-house''capability with which both new electrical (e. g., device model development) and algorithmic (e. g., faster time-integration methods) research and development can be performed. Furthermore, these capabilities will then be migrated to the end users...|$|E
40|$|Airborne sound {{insulation}} {{index of the}} noise barrier panel and the sound absorption coefficient of the barrier surface are the acoustic parameters that are usually determined in specialized laboratories, however they can be also determined in situ.

30|$|However, one {{limitation}} of the current BOS UI {{is that it can}} only manage the devices that have already been integrated into a building operating system.

40|$|Monitoring {{the status}} of {{existing}} devices and identification of newly <b>added</b> <b>devices</b> is required in microgrids to adjust the operation schedule followed by any event or integration of a new device. Therefore, in this paper, automatic reconfiguration of microgrids is considered after {{the addition of a}} new device or change in the operation status of an existing device by using a multiagent system. This capability of the microgrid is named as auto-configuration function, which is performed by the auto-configurator agent. In case of addition of a new device, the auto-configurator agent is responsible for authorization and registration of the newly <b>added</b> <b>device.</b> In case of change in status of any existing device, the status information is updated. After integration of a new device or change in status of an existing device, re-optimization is carried out by the energy management system (EMS) agent.
