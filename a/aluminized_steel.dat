In a 307 -day dynamic test at 18 ft/sec and 315 deg C, X 8001 aluminum corroded {{at a rate}} of 1 / 2 mdd for the first 240 days. In subsequent exposures, the corrosion rate increased, but the total average penetration at 307 days was only 0. 0005 inch. At 200 days, the total corrosion in this test was one-fiftieth that in distilled water. Static tests at 225 deg C gave corrosion rates too low to measure (< 0. 2 mdd). Of several different 18 - 8 stainless steels tested in this solution at 315 deg C, only sensitized type 316 suffered intergranular attack. General attack rates of the other samples, of the order of 1 / 4 mdd, were obtained for the period from 94 to 186 days. Although this is much larger than the rate in distilled water, it represents a penetration rate of only about 5 x 10 /sup -//sup 5 / inch/year. <b>Aluminized</b> carbon <b>steel</b> did not suffer rapid corrosion in this solution at 315 deg C, even when large areas of the carbon steel were exposed.

40|$|Exhaust {{lines of}} cars have been {{strongly}} evolving {{during the last}} decade to meet the various requirements of the automotive industry and the new environment regulations. This development tends to favour stainless steel grades to replace cast iron for the exhaust manifold and <b>aluminized</b> low carbon <b>steel</b> for pipes and mufflers. Among the various stainless steel grades, the proportion of ferritic grade increases for the hot part of the exhaust system as its price is lower and more stable than austenitic or refractory grades, and as it exhibits a better resistance to cyclic oxidation. A large and rapid development of stainless ferritic grades has been based on Ti and Nb stabilization. Adding niobium presents many advantages for corrosion resistance, deep-drawability, and mainly creep resistance at high temperature. The paper is focused on stainless steel with 14 wt% chromium, stabilized with Nb. Intermetallic precipitation is studied after a 100 h holding time at different temperatures (sag tests). It is shown that, depending on the test temperature and on the chemical composition of the steel, Fe 2 Nb or Fe 2 Nb 3 intermetallic particles can precipitate, which affects the creep resistance: Fe 2 Nb 3 being more stable at higher temperature.

50|$|<b>Aluminized</b> <b>steel</b> can be {{made using}} a variety of processes, cladding, hot dipping, {{galvanic}} coating, metallizing, and calorizing, but the most effective process is hot dipping. The process of hot dipping starts by cleaning the steel, then placing the steel in a bath of Al-11%Si at a temperature of 988K and shaken, then pulled out and air dried. The aluminium diffuses into the steel, creating an intermetallic layer above the steel base layer, but below the outside aluminum coating. The aluminium coating is oxidized to help protect the inner steel from corrosion and further aluminium diffusion. The silicon is added to the aluminium bath to create a thinner layer of aluminium on the steel. The hot dipping process is cheaper and more effective to produce <b>aluminized</b> <b>steel</b> than any other process.|$|E

However, early corrosion of <b>aluminized</b> <b>steel</b> pipes has been recently observed in some inland locations.

It is critical to determine the cause of early deterioration and establish methods of durability prediction. The possibility of unusual environmental conditions is being investigated elsewhere, but this research focuses on possible mechanical factors aggravating corrosion, since it is prevalent near pipe rib deformations. While forming the rib bends in the pipe, the outer bend surface is exposed to extreme tensile stresses which would cause small coating cracks (microfissures) exposing base metal.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to measure corrosion rate of both formed and flat <b>aluminized</b> <b>steel</b> samples in simulated natural waters.

The morphologies of the FeAl 3 and Fe 2 Al 5 layers are platelet and columnar structures, respectively. The oxidation test was carried out isothermally at 700 °C for a various time of 1 - 49 h in static air. The oxidation behaviors of both of the bare steel and the <b>aluminized</b> <b>steel</b> were studied by the oxidation kinetics, surface morphologies and phase transformation after oxidation testing.

40|$|<b>Aluminized</b> <b>steel</b> pipes are {{expected}} to have a long service life, e. g. 75 years. Spiral ribbed aluminized pipes (SRAP) have been widely specified and used by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) for drainage of runoff water. Confidence in the long term durability of SRAP has been challenged by recent unexpected early corrosion failures in various Florida locations. SRAP premature corrosion incidents have occurred in two modalities. Mode A has taken place in near-neutral soil environments and has often been associated with either gross manufacturing defects (i. e. helical cuts) or corrosion concentration at or near the ribs. Mode B took place in pipes in contact with limestone backfill and corrosion damage was in the form of perforations, not preferentially located at the ribs, and not necessarily associated with other deficiencies. These failures motivated this research. The objectives of this work are to establish to what extent the Mode A corrosion incidents can be ascribed to manufacturing defects, that can be rectified by appropriate quality control, as opposed to an intrinsic vulnerability to corrosion of regularly produced SRAP due to ordinary forming strains and to determine the mechanism responsible for Mode B corrosion including the role that limestone backfill played in that deterioration. To achieve those objectives, laboratory experiments were conducted to replicate the conditions for Mode A and Mode B. Overall, the findings of this and previous work suggest that much of the corrosion damage observed in the Mode A incidents were promoted more by manufacturing deficiencies and less by any possible inherent susceptibility of corrosion at the ribs of SRAP that was produced following appropriate quality control. Experiments to explore the causes of Mode B corrosion showed that high pH values, sufficient to cause dissolution of the passive film on aluminum, can develop under exposure of limestone to flowing natural water. The findings substantiate, for the first time, an important vulnerability of <b>aluminized</b> <b>steel</b> in limestone soils and provide an explanation for the rapid onset deterioration observed at the field under Mode B. The findings also provide strong evidence in support of service guidelines to disallow the use of limestone bedding for <b>aluminized</b> <b>steel</b> pipe, including SRAP...|$|E

The objective {{of the current study}} is to study effect of temperature on the thicknesses and phase morphology of the coating and intermetallic layer that is formed during hot-dip aluminizing of steel at a constant immersion time of 30 minutes. 1040 steel substrates were aluminized by hot-dipping procedure in pure aluminium and in three different Al-Si alloy melts of varying composition. Hot-dipping was done at three different temperatures mainly at 933, 973 and 1023 K. The steel specimens were held in the melts for 30 minutes after which they were withdrawn from the molten aluminium and allowed to cool to room temperature. The coated samples were then sectioned for metallographic sample preparation. The samples were characterized for thickness of the coating and intermetallic phase thickness and phase composition of both the coating and intermetallic layers. The samples were analyzed by optical light microscope, SEM, EPMA, XRD and micro hardness. The results show that a greater thickness of the coating and intermetallic layer is obtained with increase in immersion temperature.

(1) EDX- and EBSD-mappings were performed on the cross section of a hot-dip <b>aluminized</b> <b>steel</b> and showed the presence of the two single phased intermetallic layers, theta and eta, just beneath the aluminum top-layer. The XRD-pattern of a sample of which the top aluminum layer was removed, confirmed the foregoing observations. The compositions of both layers were determined by APT and yield Fe 4 Al 13 and Fe 2 Al 5. 6. DFT calculations showed the stability of the Fe 4 Al 13 phase and predicted Fe 4 Al 13 to be the only stable composition in that area of the Fe-Al phase diagram. Based on the DFT results, the ILEEMS spectrum of the theta-layer could be successfully analyzed and, for the first time, fully interpreted in accordance with the crystallographic structure of Fe 4 Al 13. Fe 4 Al 13 is suggested for referring to the composition of the theta-layer, instead of other formulae, e. g. FeAl 3. The ILEEMSThlayer spectrum was best reproduced by a model-independent quadrupole splitting distribution, which supports the dis-ordered structure model for the eta-layer.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} {{the performance of the}} preferred Ferritic 430 SS for manufacturing automobile and motor-cycle exhaust systems. The aluminizing coating on the surface of bare steel was applied by hot-dipping method in a molten pure aluminum. The high temperature oxidation of the <b>aluminized</b> <b>steel</b> was cyclically studied at 900 °C and 1000 °C in static air. The degradation of intermetallic layers during cyclic oxidation were analyzed by means of X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). The crack perpendicular to the specimen surface rapidly propagated through the FeAl and Fe 3 Al layers due to a thermal expansion mismatch upon cooling to room temperature. The accumulation of voids generated crack at the interface between the aluminide layer and the steel substrate. Oxygen is allowed to penetrate into the aluminide layer crack, rapidly forming alumina oxide and closing the crack. Some of the aluminide layers peeled off due to this rapid growth. Thus, the protective Al 2 O 3 layer degraded and later, the substrate was oxidized subsequently to form iron-rich oxide (Fe 2 O 3) at 1000 °C...|$|E

The California Method 643 is {{utilized}} to estimate steel pipe service life at locations throughout the state. Over 560 soil resistivity and pH samples were collected statewide during summer 2014 along embankments of state-trunk and county highways. Concurrent observations of soil texture, surrounding landscape, roadway type, and water presence were also made; water pH and conductivity measures were made where applicable. Data verification efforts to build confidence in field-measured soil pH and soil resistivity included comparing data to other available datasets including geology, soil pH, electrical conductivity, and soil texture, as well as observations available from district and county engineers. Field-measured soil pH data, with some exceptions in Districts 2 and 6, generally aligned with the available STATSGO soil pH data, indicating that this layer could reasonably be used in service-life calculations as it has greater resolution than provided by field data. In the absence of a statewide soil resistivity or electrical conductivity map, field-classified soil textures and the statewide STATSGO soil texture map were used to estimate soil resistivity values.

Produced by Bettcher Manufacturing Corporation, Cleveland, Ohio, Panelblocs are applicable to industrial or other facilities which have ceilings more than 12 feet high, such as those pictured: at left the Bare Hills Tennis Club, Baltimore, Maryland and at right, CVA Lincoln- Mercury, Gaithersburg, Maryland. The heaters are mounted high above the floor and they radiate infrared energy downward. Panelblocs do not waste energy by warming the surrounding air. Instead, they beam invisible heat rays directly to objects which absorb the radiation- people, floors, machinery and other plant equipment. All these objects in turn re-radiate the energy to the air.

40|$|Abstract. A hot dip {{aluminizing}} {{process to}} simulate the continuous galvanizing line (CGL) {{was carried out in}} three successive steps by a hot dip simulator: the pre-treatment for removing scales on the 200 × 250 mm 2 and 1 mm in thickness cold rolled steel sheet, the dipping in 660 °C Al-Si melt for 3 s and the cooling. In a pre-treatment, the steel specimen was partly coated by Au to confirm the mechanism of intermetallic compound (IMC) formation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses were followed to observe the cross-section and the distribution of the elements. The specimen was analyzed in the boundary of the dipped-undipped part to see the formation mechanism of the <b>aluminized</b> <b>steel.</b> An intermetallic compound (IMC) is rapidly developed and grown in the steel-liquid interface. It has been usually reported that the IMC was formed by the dissolution of iron in the steel substrate toward the melt and the diffusion of aluminum in an opposite direction. The specimen is covered with aluminum- 10 wt. % silicon, forms the IMC in the part that was not Au coated. However, IMC is not formed in the Au-coated part. The interface of the dipped-undipped is also analyzed by EDX. At the interface of the steel-IMC, it is clearly shown that the IMC is only formed in the dipped part and exists in the steel substrate as well, and contributes by iron, aluminum and silicon. The result clearly shows that only aluminum diffuses into the steel substrate without the dissolution of iron and forms the IMC between the steel substrate and the melt. Au coating and the short dipping time prevent the iron from dissolving into the aluminum melt. By TEM combined with focused ion beam (FIB) sample preparation, the IMC is confirmed as Fe 2 SiAl 8, a hexagonal structure with space group P 63 /mmc...|$|E
40|$|<b>Aluminized</b> <b>steel</b> Type 2 (AST 2), {{often used}} for culvert pipes, is subject to {{corrosion}} {{which is the most}} important durability limitation factor. It was desired to determine if the outer aluminized layer will retain passivity and if protective galvanic action will develop. Thus, corrosion of unblemished and blemished AST 2 surfaces was investigated in simulated natural waters. Experiments with unblemished specimens showed passive corrosion rates (0. 06 µm/yr) in scale-forming, 0. 01 M Cl- solutions but sustained corrosion in other less protective media (with rates 3 10 µm/yr). Corrosion was manifested macroscopically by discoloration and few macro pits, but it likely proceeded also microscopically at the Fe-rich inclusion space scale. For blemished specimens, the aluminized coating galvanically protected to some extent the steel in all solutions. However, in 0. 01 M Cl- solutions, protection was delayed until after some steel corrosion had occurred. In some solutions, complete consumption of the outer aluminized coating around exposed steel was noted. Elsewhere, coating appearance was {{similar to that of the}} unblemished condition. Nominal durability projections made for 16 -gage AST 2 ranged from 3 ̆e 100 yr for unblemished AST 2 to 10 yr for the blemished condition. The present findings were used as a first step in proposing refinements of presently used durability guidelines of AST 2 culvert pipe. Cyclic cathodic polarization tests to examine O 2 and H 2 reduction at the Fe-rich inclusions showed significant hysteresis, more pronounced with decreasing scan rate. The effect was tentatively associated to the amount of Fe+ 2 being deposited during the downward scan, a hypothesis supported by results from a physical model. A static polarization model was formulated for the blemished configuration. Results matched experimental trends and permitted evaluating the effect of solution conductivity s beyond the experimental range. Exposed steel corrosion rates at the steel were increasingly large for decreasing s. For the lowest s, corrosion rates at the exposed steel center were distinctly larger than at the edge, consistent with experiments. An impedance behavior model was also formulated. Results showed frequency dependent current distribution and predicted relatively small artifacts that were and not evident experimentally, but should be considered when exploring other system conditions...|$|E
