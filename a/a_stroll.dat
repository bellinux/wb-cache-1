5|$|On 5 September 2007, Chris Taylor, {{mounted on}} a {{pantomime}} horse, confronted police officers, who were on foot, and {{asked them if they}} needed any reinforcements against APEC protesters. When his offer was refused, Taylor took the horse for <b>a</b> <b>stroll</b> anyway, and was met by amused onlookers and media personnel. He was later asked by police officers to remove his clothing for examination, since it resembled a police uniform; but no charges of impersonating police were laid. The reference was to the horse flu outbreak, which forced police officers to face APEC protesters on foot. This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode.|$|E

25|$|On 18 February 1853, Franz Joseph survived an {{assassination}} attempt by Hungarian nationalist János Libényi. The emperor was taking <b>a</b> <b>stroll</b> {{with one of his}} officers, Count Maximilian Karl Lamoral O'Donnell of Tír Chonaill, on a city bastion, when Libényi approached him. He immediately struck the emperor from behind with a knife straight at the neck. Franz Joseph almost always wore a uniform, which had a high collar that almost completely enclosed the neck. The collars of uniforms at that time were made from very sturdy material, precisely to counter this kind of attack. Even though the Emperor was wounded and bleeding, the collar saved his life. Count O'Donnell struck Libényi down with his sabre.|$|E

500|$|Gibbs's {{retiring}} {{personality and}} intense {{focus on his}} work limited his accessibility to students. His principal protégé was Edwin Bidwell Wilson, who nonetheless explained that [...] "except in the classroom I saw very little of Gibbs.

[...] Gibbs did supervise the doctoral thesis on mathematical economics written by Irving Fisher in 1891. After Gibbs's death, Fisher financed the publication of his Collected Works.

500|$|As a man, Richardson {{was on the}} {{one hand}} deeply private and on the other flamboyantly unconventional. Frank Muir said of him, [...] "It's the Ralphdom of Ralph that one has to cling to; he wasn't really quite like other people." [...] In Coveney's phrase, [...] "His oddness was ever startling and never {{hardened}} into mere eccentricity." [...] Richardson would introduce colleagues to his ferrets by name, ride at high speed on his powerful motor-bike in his seventies, have a parrot flying round his study eating his pencils, or take a pet mouse out for <b>a</b> <b>stroll,</b> but behind such unorthodox behaviour there was a closely guarded self who remained an enigma to even his closest colleagues. Tynan wrote in The New Yorker that Richardson [...] "made me feel that I have known this man all my life and that I have never met anyone who more adroitly buttonholed me while keeping me firmly at arm's length." ...|$|E

500|$|Andy Shaw of Grovel on {{the other}} hand had a more {{negative}} response, praising the artwork of Dave McKean and calling it [...] "brilliant", but criticized Morrison's story as claustrophobic and [...] "has more ponderous psychology than action and, as a result, not enough room to fit any decent action in." [...] Shaw would later add that Morrison's work [...] "doesn't stand up to his rivals," [...] and that [...] "mixing the history of the asylum – famous dumping ground for Batman's psychotic foes – with a typical Batman adventure is interesting enough, but Morrison throws too much at the hero in too small a space. This makes Batman's journey through Arkham's finest nutters appear too easy – more of <b>a</b> <b>stroll</b> through a fairground haunted house with a few old chums than a serious battle for his life. Coupled with an anti-climatic ending, there's little feeling of impending disaster – the chronicled event should probably appear in Batman's casebook of over-hyped walkovers." [...] Morrison himself admitted that the amount of symbolism made him [...] " [...] up being accused of doing the most pretentious Batman book ever.|$|E

500|$|Lynsey Hanley {{writing for}} The Daily Telegraph {{described}} [...] "Girl" [...] as an obvious {{choice for a}} single and hailed it as [...] "Beyoncé's requisite feminist anthem". A reviewer from Billboard magazine felt that the band's [...] "personal transition from teen-dom to womanhood" [...] was most evident on [...] "Girl" [...] among other songs. Slant Magazine's Eic Henderson {{felt that it was}} a [...] "smooth bump-and-grinder... almost sunk by the group's hyperbolic vocal arrangements". Vibes writer Dimitri Enrlich concluded, [...] "Destiny's Child refuses to play it safe with cookie-cutter formulas" [...] something he found evident on [...] "Girl". The Observer reviewer Kitty Empire noted that the band's characteristic female solidarity, [...] "is limply expressed in 'Girl', on which they purport to be your best friend". While reviewing #1's, Thomas Inskeep from Stylus Magazine described the song as [...] "lovely". Jess Harvell writing for Pitchfork Media opined, [...] "'Girl' was <b>a</b> <b>stroll</b> over a 9th Wonder-produced Dramatics sample through bros-before-hoes territory as latte frothy as its 'Sex & the City' video."

500|$|Mythily Ramachandran of Gulf News {{praised the}} film's humour and performances: [...] "The anger and hatred one often {{associates}} with a revenge tale is missing"; humour takes over, {{and the film}} [...] "busts the notion that revenge tales must be laden with gore and violence". According to Deepa Gauri of the Khaleej Times, Maheshinte Prathikaram is a boon for a Malayalam cinema with an [...] "identity crisis". She praised the film's screenplay and direction: [...] "Every frame shows the minute detailing, which gives [...] its real heart. Charming you with wit, underlining humour and with characters who behave without any cinematic hangover". Raj Vikram of Metromatinee.com also gave a positive review: [...] "There {{is not a single}} scene in the film which appears cooked up ... He [...] must be commended for being sure-footed about what he intended to portray". Vikram praised the performances by Faasil and the supporting cast, the [...] "magnificent camera" [...] and the [...] "songs which seamlessly and melodiously merge with the narrative", concluding that it [...] "is a movie that is true to itself. It surprises with its all pervading simplicity and makes even revenge look like <b>a</b> <b>stroll</b> in the park".|$|E
500|$|Matters {{came to a}} {{head when}} Ernest {{returned}} for what would prove to be his only visit to England as King of Hanover, in 1843. He was welcomed warmly, everywhere but at the Palace. At the wedding of Princess Augusta of Cambridge, he attempted to insist on a superior place to that of Prince Albert. The 50-years-younger prince settled things with what Albert described as a [...] "strong push", and carefully wrote his name on the certificate under the Queen's, so close to his wife's as to leave no space for the King's signature. The King apparently held no grudge, as he invited the Prince for <b>a</b> <b>stroll</b> in the park. When Albert demurred {{on the grounds that they}} might be jostled by crowds, the King replied, [...] "When I lived here I was quite as unpopular as you are and they never bothered me." [...] Shortly after the wedding, the King injured himself in a fall, with Albert writing to his brother, [...] "Happily he fell over some stones in Kew and damaged some ribs." [...] This injury spared him further contact with Victoria and Albert. During his visit, the King found time to take his place as Duke of Cumberland in the House of Lords. Victoria recorded in her journal that the King had stated when asked if he would speak in the Lords, [...] "No, I shall not, unless the Devil prompts me!" [...] The Queen also recorded that though King Ernest greatly enjoyed listening to the debates, he did not himself speak.|$|E

Kelly {{also makes the}} remark, [...] "I hope Dwight gets fired and they get a hot new guy to replace him," [...] to which Oscar replies, [...] "Seriously." [...] In another 52-second scene, Michael asks Dwight to go on <b>a</b> <b>stroll,</b> but Dwight suggests {{turning it into a}} [...] "power stroll", which he prepares Michael for by applying sunscreen to his face. And in a follow-up to the scene where workers discuss that Michael should be fired, a visibly angry and upset Michael confronts the office. When he says [...] "Can any of you imagine this office without me?" [...] everyone gleefully raises their hands, but Michael then asks them if they've thought about what kind of terrible person they could get to replace him; he then pointedly says that they could get someone who knows they don't actually need three accountants (Oscar, Kevin, and Angela look visibly ashamed that Michael knew this going back to Season 2's Halloween episode but has never taken any action about it) or someone who doesn't approve of romantic relationships and would transfer one or both people having one to separate branches (Jim and Pam in turn get this message and look thoughtful), and tells the office that they should mind what they're saying about him [...] "when I'm hiding in the bathroom pretending to be pooping." ...|$|E

[...] After smoking a cigar on the veranda, the President rode with his wife to the train which now awaited them nearby, and saw her settled there before touring the hydroelectric plant at the Falls. [...] The train then returned to Buffalo so McKinley could attend the reception at the Temple of Music. [...] Ida McKinley had originally intended to accompany her husband to the auditorium, but as she was not fully recovered, she decided to return to the Milburn House to rest. [...] As the time allotted for the reception had been pared down to ten minutes, the President did not expect to be separated from his wife for long.
