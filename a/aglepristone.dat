50|$|<b>Aglepristone</b> (INN) (brand name Alizine; former {{developmental}} code names RU-46534, RU-534) is a synthetic, steroidal antiprogestogen {{related to}} mifepristone which is marketed by Virbac in several European countries {{for use in}} veterinary medicine. It is specifically used as an abortifacient in pregnant animals. <b>Aglepristone,</b> similarly to mifepristone, also possesses some antiglucocorticoid activity.|$|E
50|$|Antiprogestogens {{are used}} as abortifacients and {{emergency}} contraceptives and {{in the treatment of}} uterine fibroids. They are also being studied in the treatment of breast cancer. Examples of antiprogestogens include the progesterone receptor weak partial agonist mifepristone, the selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM) ulipristal acetate, and the silent antagonist <b>aglepristone.</b> For medical abortion, mifepristone is combined with a prostaglandin (e.g., gemeprost).|$|E
50|$|A {{selective}} progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM) is {{an agent}} that acts on the progesterone receptor. A characteristic that distinguishes such substances from full receptor agonists (such as progesterone) and full antagonists (such as <b>aglepristone)</b> {{is that their}} action differs in different tissues, i.e. agonist in some tissues while antagonist in others. This mixed profile of action leads to stimulation or inhibition in tissue-specific manner, which further raises the possibility of dissociating undesirable adverse effects from the development of synthetic progesterone receptor drug candidates.|$|E
5000|$|As a protein, the {{progesterone}} receptor (Fig. 1) is {{a member}} of the ligand-dependent nuclear hormone receptor family. [...] Two major progesterone receptor isoforms, A and B, as well as some other less common splice variants have been identified and they are all encoded by the same 8 exons gene. Like other steroid nuclear receptors, the full-length protein, isoform B, can be divided into 4 functional regions, namely a variable N-terminal region followed by a highly conserved DNA-binding domain, variable hinge region and moderately conserved ligand binding domain. The ligand binding site, known as AF2 domain , is expressed by exons 4-8, corresponding to 253 amino acids, and its structure is of great interest to SPRM development. [...] It consists of 10 α-helices (H1, H3-H12) forming 3 layered bundle entwined with 4 β-sheets [...] H12 is a condensed contiguous unit composed of helices 10 and 11, which has been suggested to participate in the process of co-activator binding. The ligand binding domain of the receptor is in equilibrium between two different conformations. The first is an agonist conformation which favors the binding of coactivator proteins which in turn favors upregulation of gene transcription. The second is an antagonistic conformation which in contrast favors the binding of corepressors and as a consequence down regulation of gene expression. Full agonists such as progesterone, which display agonist properties in all tissues, strongly shift the conformational equilibrium in the agonist direction. [...] Conversely full antagonists such as <b>aglepristone</b> strongly shift the equilibrium in the antagonist direction. Finally, the overall ratio of concentrations of coactivator to corepressor may differ in different cell types.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAglepristone (RU 46534) is a {{competitive}} progesterone antagonist that is indicated {{for the treatment}} of various progesterone-dependent physiological or pathologic conditions. <b>Aglepristone</b> has proven to be an effective means of terminating pregnancy in most species.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective. Evaluate the {{effectiveness}} of <b>aglepristone</b> with and without cloprostenol for treating canine pyometra. Materials and methods. Ten female French Bulldogs between 3 - 8 years of age diagnosed with pyometra {{were divided into two}} groups, one receiving a 10 mg/kg dose of <b>aglepristone</b> subcutaneously on days 1, 2, 8, 14 and 28, and the other an equal dose on days 1, 3, 8 and 15, as well as a 1 µg/kg dose of cloprostenol subcutaneously on days 3 and 8. Both groups received 5 mg/kg of enrofloxacin orally every 12 hours for 28 days. Hematic profiles were generated on days 1 and 28 and counted days until the next heat, expelling purulent material and of clinical recuperation. Results. There was no statistical difference in the variables of the line red blood cells between times and protocols. The line of white blood cells showed a statistical difference between days of treatment but not between the two groups. Both treatments were effective resulting in complete clinical recuperation. The combination of <b>aglepristone</b> with cloprostenol acted more quickly, decreasing the number of days of secretion, abdominal pain, and the recuperation of normal activity and appetite. All 10 females were bred during their first heat. Three females from the <b>aglepristone</b> group and one from the combined <b>aglepristone</b> with cloprostenol group were impregnated. Conclusions. Both protocols, combined with enrofloxacin, produced complete clinical recuperation in bitches with pyometra, but it was achieved more rapidly when given the combination of both <b>aglepristone</b> and cloprostenol...|$|E
40|$|Background: Progesterone receptors play a {{key role}} in the {{development}} of canine mammary tumours, and recent research has focussed on their possible value as therapeutic targets using antiprogestins. Cloning and sequencing of the progesterone receptor gene has shown that the receptor has two isoforms, A and B, transcribed from a single gene. Experimental studies in human breast cancer suggest that the differential expression of progesterone receptor isoforms has implications for hormone therapy responsiveness. This study examined the effects of the antiprogestin <b>aglepristone</b> on cell proliferation and mRNA expression of progesterone receptor isoforms A and B in mammary carcinomas in dogs treated with 20 mg/Kg of <b>aglepristone</b> (n = 22) or vehicle (n = 5) twice before surgery. Results: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples taken before and after treatment were used to analyse total progesterone receptor and both isoforms by RT-qPCR and Ki 67 antigen labelling. Both total progesterone receptor and isoform A mRNA expression levels decreased after treatment with <b>aglepristone.</b> Furthermore, a significant decrease in the proliferation index (percentage of Ki 67 -labelled cells) was observed in progesterone-receptor positive and isoform-A positive tumours in aglepristone-treated dogs.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine the <b>aglepristone</b> (RU 534) mechanisms affecting the corpora lutea (CL) lifespan in pseudopregnant rabbits. <b>Aglepristone</b> (10 mg/kg b. w.) was injected subcutaneously twice at either early- or mid-luteal phase (Days 3 and 4, or Days 8 and 9, respectively) after induction of ovulation with GnRH (Day 0). Corpora lutea and uteri, explanted at days 6 and 11, were evaluated for immunohistochemistry and western blotting of progesterone (PR) and estrogen (ER) receptors, cyclooxygenase 1 (COX 1), COX 2, and PGE 2 - 9 -ketoreductase (PGE 2 - 9 -K) enzymatic activities, and progesterone, PGF 2 α, and PGE 2 in vitro synthesis. Independent of luteal stage, <b>aglepristone</b> prolonged the functional luteal phase by 3 Days over that of controls as assessed by blood progesterone profiles. <b>Aglepristone</b> decreased protein for ER during both luteal-stages in CL and uteri. Progesterone receptor protein was decreased by RU 354 at Days 6 in the uterus and at Days 11 in CL, whereas RU 534 increased PR at Days 11 in uteri. In the CL, RU 534 enhanced progesterone production at Days 6 and 11, whereas it decreased PGF 2 α and increased PGE 2 at Day 11. In the uteri, RU 534 decreased PGF 2 α and increased PGE 2 synthesis at both days. COX 2 and PGE 2 - 9 K activities were decreased by RU 534 in the CL at Day 11, whereas in the uteri COX 2 increased and PGE 2 - 9 -K decreased at Days 6 and 11.

In the bitch, leptin but not LEP-R protein was detected in the non-pregnant corpus luteum (CL). Until now, no further information has been available on their expression levels and role in CL function. Our objective was to compare time-related changes in luteal LEP and LEP-R mRNA levels during the non-pregnant luteal phase, pregnancy and after <b>aglepristone</b> treatment in mid-gestation. CLs were collected by ovariohysterectomy at different time points: day (d) 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 65 after ovulation (p. o.) in non-pregnant bitches; pre-implantation, post-implantation, mid-gestation, during prepartum luteolysis; 24 and 72  h after <b>aglepristone</b> injection. Non-pregnant LEP expression was lowest on d 5 p. o., increased thereafter and fell again on d 45 (P ≤  0. 04). LEP-R expression was not altered (P =  0. 07).

Fifteen treated and 13 control bitches were inseminated at Days + 1 and + 2 after ovulation (Day 0). Stages of oocyte maturation and embryo development were determined after ovariectomy at different time points after ovulation. <b>Aglepristone</b> did not prevent ovulation but delayed the resumption of oocyte meiosis and inhibited its progression: first metaphase (M) I stages were observed at 173 h post-ovulation and 39 % of oocytes reached MII as late as 335 h post-ovulation in treated females whereas first MI occurred at 76 h and 100 % of oocytes were in MII at 109 h post-ovulation in controls. <b>Aglepristone</b> extended the stay of morphologically normal oocytes within the oviducts: first signs of oocyte degeneration were observed at 335 h in treated vs. 100 - 110 h post-ovulation in control bitches.

40|$|In the bitch, the {{mechanisms}} that regulate luteal function are still unclear. To investigate {{the role of}} progesterone on the gonadal axis the antiprogestinic <b>aglepristone</b> (Alizine Virbac, France) was administered to non-pregnant bitches during their luteal phase. Bitches were assigned to either control or treated groups. The first day of cytological diestrus was designed as day 0. On both days 21 and 22 of diestrus, control bitches (n = 4) received s. c. saline solution (0. 3 ml/kg body weight) and treated ones (n = 4) <b>aglepristone</b> (10 mg/kg body weight). From day 0 to day 70 of diestrus, blood samples were collected from each bitch twice a week to evaluate luteal function through plasma progesterone (P 4) concentrations.

On the 26 th day after LH peak an ovariohysterectomy was performed. Blood samples were screened for estradiol and progesterone concentrations. Ovaries and uterine horns and bodies were isolated for histological and morphometrical diagnosis and immunohistochemistry analysis of α-estrogen and progesterone receptor expression. A decrease of progesterone (p< 0. 01) and no differences in total estrogen level in the study group were observed. There were no significant differences either in the histomorphometry or α-estrogen and progesterone receptors expression in ovaries. Increase in expression of progesterone receptors in endometrium without surface epithelium of horns (p< 0. 05), endometrial surface epithelium (p< 0. 05), myometrium of uterine body (p< 0. 01) and estrogen receptors in endometrium without surface epithelium of horns (p< 0. 05) was observed. Elevated estrogen receptors probably increased sensitivity of tissues to estrogens in the bloodstream and led to notable inflammation, haemorrhages, and hyperplasia in endometrium with mononuclear immune cell infiltration. The myometrium of horns and endometrium of uterine body of study bitches were significantly thicker than in the control group (p< 0. 05 and p< 0. 01).

40|$|A higher {{incidence}} of fetal losses, especially after the use of artificial reproduction techniques, asks for more intensive monitoring of bovine pregnancies. In this study, a model for fetal death (FD) was created by administering the antiprogesterone <b>aglepristone</b> twice, at Day 47 and 48 of gestation (n = 5). Control heifers received the solvent (n = 5). The temporal relationships between changes in ultrasonographic appearance of fetal fluids and membranes, fetal heart rate (FHR) and peripheral plasma levels of pregnancy-associated glycoprotein (PAG) and PGF 2 alpha-metabolite as determined by radioimmunoassay associated with FD were monitored at eight hour intervals around treatment. For the analysis of plasma levels the period under study was divided into five epochs (T I: before injection of aglepristone/solvent; T 2 : from first to second injection; T 3 : from second injection to FD; T 4 : from diagnosis of FD to 56 h later; T 5 : from 56 It to 104 h after diagnosis of FD). Control heifers produced healthy calves at term, but in treated heifers, FD occurred on average at 58 (range 48 - 80) h after first injection of <b>aglepristone.</b> Fetal death was always preceded by a visible reduction {{of the amount of}} allantoic fluid and by segregation of the allantochorionic membrane from the endometrium. FHR remained rather constant in both groups, but a (non-significant) drop in FHR around 8 h before FD was diagnosed in four of five treated animals. All fetuses were expulsed after FD. Levels of PAG remained constant or even slightly increased in controls, but decreased in treated animals from T 2 onward: levels during T 4 and T 5 significantly differed from those during T 1 and from values in controls during T 4 and T 5 (P < 0. 01).

40|$|In non{{pregnant}} {{and pregnant}} dogs the corpora lutea (CL) {{are the only}} source of progesterone (P 4) which shows an almost identical secretion pattern until the rapid decrease of P 4 prior to parturition. For the nonpregnant dog clear evidence has been obtained that physiological luteal regression is devoid of a functional role of the PGF 2 alpha-system and seems to depend on the provision of StAR. Yet in pregnant dogs the rapid prepartal luteal regression, coinciding with an increase of PGF 2 alpha, may be indicative for different regulatory mechanisms. To assess this situation and by applying semi-quantitative Real Time (Taq Man) RT-PCR, expression patterns were determined for the following factors in CL of pregnant and prepartal dogs and of mid-pregnant dogs treated with the antiprogestin Aglepristone: cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox 2), prostaglandin E 2 synthase (PGES), prostaglandin F 2 alpha synthase (PGFS), its receptors (EP 2, EP 4 an FP), the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), 3 beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase (3 betaHSD) and the progesterone receptor (PR). Peripheral plasma P 4 concentrations were determined by RIA. CL were collected via ovariohysterectomy from pregnant bitches (n= 3 - 5) on days 8 - 12 (Group 1, pre-implantation period), days 18 - 25 (Group 2, post-implantation period), days 35 - 40 (Group 3, mid-gestation period) and during the prepartal progesterone decline (Group 4). Additionally, CL were obtained from groups of 5 mid-pregnant dogs (days 40 - 45) 24 h, respectively 72 h after the second treatment with <b>Aglepristone.</b> Expression of Cox 2 and PGES was highest during the pre-implantation period, that of PGFS and FP during the post-implantation period. EP 4 and EP 2 revealed a constant expression pattern throughout pregnancy with a prepartal upregulation of EP 2. 3 betaHSD and StAR decreased significantly from the pre-implatation period to prepartal luteolysis, it was matched by the course of P 4 concentrations. Expression of the PR was higher during mid-gestation and prepartal luteolysis than in the two preceding periods. After application of <b>Aglepristone</b> the overall mRNA-expression resembled the situation during prepartal luteolysis except for EP 2, which remained unchanged. These data suggest that - as in the nonpregnant bitch - also in the pregnant bitch luteal production of prostaglandins is associated with luteal support rather than luteolysis.

40|$|PPARγ is {{a nuclear}} hormone {{receptor}} of the PPAR family of transcription factors {{closely related to}} the steroid hormone receptors serving multiple roles in regulating reproductive function. Endogenous factors from the arachidonic acid metabolites group serve as ligands for PPARs. PPARγ modifies the steroidogenic capacity of reproductive tissues and has been defined as a key mediator of biological actions of progesterone receptor in granulosa cells; it modulates biochemical and morphological placental trophoblast differentiation during implantation and placentation. However, no such information is available for the dog. Hence, the expression and possible functions of PPARγ were assessed in corpora lutea (CL) and utero/placental (Ut/Pl) compartment collected from bitches (n = 3 to 5) on days 8 to 12 (pre-implantation), 18 to 25 (post-implantation), 35 to 40 (mid-gestation) of pregnancy and at prepartal luteolysis. Additionally, 10 mid-pregnant bitches were treated with the antiprogestin <b>Aglepristone</b> [10 mg/Kg bw (2 x/ 24 h) ]; ovariohysterectomy was 24 h and 72 h after the 2 nd treatment. Of the two PPARγ isoforms, PPARγ 1 was the only isoform clearly detectable in all canine CL and utero/placental samples. The luteal PPARγ was upregulated throughout pregnancy, a prepartal downregulation was observed. Placental expression of PPARγ was elevated after implantation and at mid-gestation, followed by a prepartal downregulation. All changes were more pronounced at the protein-level suggesting that the PPARγ expression may be regulated at the post-transcriptional level. Within the CL PPARγ was localized to the luteal cells. Placental expression was targeted solely to the fetal trophoblast cells; a regulatory role of PPARγ in canine placental development possibly through influencing the invasion of fetal trophoblast cells is suggested. Treatment with <b>Aglepristone</b> led to downregulation of PPARγ in either compartment, implying the functional interrelationship with progesterone receptor...|$|E

Additionally, ten mid-pregnant bitches were treated with the antiprogestin <b>aglepristone</b> (10 mg/kg bw (2 x/ 24 h)); ovariohysterectomy was 24 and 72 h after the second treatment. Plasma progesterone and 15 -ketodihydro-PGF 2 alpha (PGFM) concentrations were determined by RIA. Expression of the PGR was highest before implantation and primarily located to the endometrium; expression in the placenta was restricted to the decidual cells. PTGS 2 was constantly low expressed until mid-gestation; a strong upregulation occurred at prepartal luteolysis concomitant {{with an increase in}} PGFM. PGFS was upregulated after implantation and significantly elevated through early and mid-gestation. PTGES showed a gradual increase and a strong prepartal upregulation. PTGFR, PTGER 2, and PTGER 4 were downregulated after implantation; a gradual upregulation of PTGFR and PTGER 2 occurred towards parturition. ISH and IHC co-localized PGFS, PTGFR, PTGES, and PTGS 2 in the trophoblast and endometrium. The changes following application of <b>aglepristone</b> were {{in the same direction as}} those observed from mid-gestation to prepartal luteolysis. These data suggest that the prepartal increase of PGF 2 alpha results from a strong upregulation of PTGS 2 in the fetal trophoblast with the withdrawal of progesterone having a signalling function and the decidual cells playing a key role in the underlying cell-to-cell crosstal...|$|E
40|$|Folliculogenesis is the {{fundamental}} process leading to oocyte maturation and its developmental competence, which are determined by oocyte and follicular cells interplay (Luciano et al., 2004). Recent studies in cattle describe Progesterone (P 4) as a key molecule acting during follicle development through different signaling pathways involving different receptors (Aparicio et al., 2011, Nilsson et al., 2009). The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the effect on oocyte meiotic maturation of inhibiting two P 4 receptors: Progesterone Receptor Membrane Component 1 (PGRMC 1) and the classic nuclear Progesterone Receptor (nPR) respectively using the specific inhibitors AG 205 and <b>Aglepristone.</b> Bovine cumulus cell-oocyte complexes (COCs) and denuded oocytes (DOs) were in vitro matured with different concentrations of AG 205. Our results showed a decrease both in first polar body (PBI) extrusion and in the percentage of oocytes reaching MII stage in treated oocytes compared to controls (one way ANOVA, P< 0. 05); these effects were more marked in DOs, confirming PGRMC 1 specific role in the oocyte. In AG 205 treated oocytes aberrant meiotic figures were observed, including double metaphase plates or DNA scattered in the ooplasm. In addition, aberrant meiotic plates showed irregular co-localization of PGRMC 1 and AURKB; the proteins didn’t localize at the centromeric region of each chromosomes as previously described (Luciano et al., 2013). This results suggests a P 4 role in meiotic division mediated by PGRMC 1 receptor. By contrast, <b>Aglepristone</b> inhibition of nPR didn’t affect dramatically the percentage of oocytes reaching MII stage of maturation. However, MII plates morphology analysis showed a significantly greater tubulin spindle length. This feature could account for the previously described reduced in vitro embryo development consequent to nPR inhibition (Aparicio et al., 2011). Thus, P 4 driven nuclear maturation could act on different oocyte development stages. Further studies are in progress to elucidate P 4 complex action in mammalian oocyte function...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Gonadectomy is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used method for permanent contra-ception in small animals. The irreversibility of the method is however a main drawback for its use in valuable breeding animals. Moreover, several negative side effects can be observed after surgical castration. Therefore several non-surgical methods were developed. This paper describes the current non-surgical methods of contraception used in female dogs and cats. They include hormonal procedures, such as application of progestins, androgens and GnRH analogues in order to prevent the ovarian cycle. Another method is the use of 4 –vinylcyclohexene diepoxide, an industrial chemical destroying primordial and primary ovarian follicles. Further prospective possibilities consist in immunocontraception and in the elaboration of a safe and effective vaccine with reversible effect.

40|$|Relationships between {{different}} reproductive hormones were {{studied in the}} dog 1) {{around the time of}} ovulation, 2) during spontaneous and aglepristone-induced parturition, 3) before and after gonadectomy in both males and females, and 4) before and after chemical castration with the GnRH-agonist deslorelin in males. Additionally, the effect of trilostane, a competitive inhibitor of 3 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, on progesterone production was studied. The most important conclusions from these studies were: - the plasma concentrations of LH and FSH are differentially regulated; - oestradiol- 17 β probably exerts a positive feedback effect on preovulatory LH release, as in other species; - the start of the preovulatory LH surge is associated with a slight increase in plasma progesterone concentration; - shortly after the LH surge the plasma progesterone concentration remained stable for a variable period before rising sharply. This could reflect variation in the interval between the preovulatory LH surge and ovulation, suggesting that measurement of the preovulatory LH surge is less reliable than progesterone for determining the exact time of ovulation; - <b>aglepristone</b> is an effective and safe drug for the induction of parturition in dogs that are 58 days pregnant and carry 3 or more pups. Parturition occurred 41 h (mean; range 32 h – 56 h), after the first dose of <b>aglepristone.</b> The progress of whelping and the survival and growth of pups were similar in the control and induced group. More research is necessary to determine the potential use of <b>aglepristone</b> in prolonged one- and two-pup pregnancies. - aglepristone-induced parturition is associated with incomplete luteolysis, an altered plasma PGFM profile, and elevated postpartum plasma cortisol concentrations; - GnRH administration in intact male and female anoestrous dogs induces increased plasma concentrations of LH, FSH, oestradiol and testosterone; - gonadectomy results in increased plasma concentrations of LH and FSH; - the ranges of the plasma oestradiol concentrations in anoestrous and ovariectomized bitches overlap; - the following parameters appear to be appropriate to verify {{the presence or absence of}} functional gonadal tissue - the basal plasma FSH concentration in bitches and male dogs; - the basal plasma testosterone concentration in male dogs; - the plasma oestradiol concentration 120 min after GnRH administration in bitches; - chemical castration of male dogs, caused by use of a deslorelin implant, induces decreased plasma concentrations of LH and FSH and, as a consequence, lowers plasma oestradiol and testosterone concentrations to values similar to those after surgical castration; - administration of the GnRH analogue buserelin in chemically castrated male dogs, at 4. 5 months after administration of a deslorelin implant, induced a significant increase of the plasma LH concentration, indicating that the pituitary gonadotrophs were not completely desensitized in all dogs; - trilostane is effective in decreasing plasma progesterone concentration during the luteal phase, but the treatment regimen used in this study resulted in less clear-cut inhibition of ovarian steroidogenesis than is probably needed for abortion. Increasing the dose of trilostane is probably not a good option, for the adrenal reserve capacity had decreased more than what is considered to be safe in dogs...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Progesterone {{receptor}} (PR) antagonist <b>aglepristone</b> (RU 534) {{has been}} used successfully for pregnancy termination and therapy of pyometra, vaginal tumors, and mammary hyperplasia in bitches and queens. All of these conditions share with canine mammary carcinomas the expression of PR. OBJECTIVES: To study the effect of RU 534 on proliferation and apoptosis in canine mammary carcinomas in relation to PR expression. ANIMALS: Twenty-seven nonspayed bitches with mammary carcinomas were treated with either 2 doses of 20 mg/kg RU 534 (n = 22, RU 534 -treated group) or oil placebo (n = 5, control group) on days 1 and 8. METHODS: Tumor samples were collected before (day 1) and after (day 15) treatment for immunohistochemistry. PR expression, proliferation index (PI), and apoptotic index (AI) were determined using antibodies against PR, Ki 67, and cleaved lamin A/C antigens, respectively.

40|$|Background Leptin (Lep) {{is known}} for its {{involvement}} in the regulation of reproductive functions. It is important for uterine receptivity, implantation, placental growth and maternal energy homeostasis in several species, but Lep’s function in the pregnant dog has not been investigated. Methods Pregnant bitches were ovariohysterectomized at pre-implantation, post-implantation, mid-gestation and prepartum luteolysis. Two additional groups were treated with <b>aglepristone</b> in mid-gestation, and ovariohysterectomized 24 or 72 h later. Lep and leptin receptor (LepR) gene expression was detected by semi-quantitative real-time PCR in pre-implantation and inter-placental uterine sections (Ut) and in utero-placental compartments (Ut/Pl). Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization (ISH) were performed for Lep and LepR protein and mRNA localization. Parametric one-way ANOVA, paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used for statistical analysis. Results In the Ut/Pl, Lep expression was higher at post-implantation and prepartum luteolysis than at mid-gestation, while in the Ut, Lep mRNA levels did not change during pregnancy. LepR expression in the Ut/Pl was up-regulated at prepartum luteolysis compared to the earlier stages. In the Ut, highest LepR mRNA was found at pre- and post-implantation. LepR expression was down-regulated in the Ut/Pl compared to the Ut at post-implantation and at mid-gestation. <b>Aglepristone</b> treatment resulted in a decrease of Lep mRNA levels from 24 to 72 h in the Ut without concomitant changes in the Ut/Pl or in LepR levels. Lep and LepR immunoreactivities were strong in the luminal and glandular epithelium in the Ut with abundant LepR signals in the subepithelial stroma. In the Ut/Pl, fetal trophoblasts stained stronger for Lep and LepR than decidual cells, and signals for both proteins were also detected in the glandular chambers. The myometrium, blood vessel media, and sporadically also the endothelium stained for Lep and LepR. ISH showed similar signal distribution in the Ut and Ut/Pl. Conclusions Lep and LepR are differentially expressed in the canine uterus and placenta during pregnancy, and their presence in various cell types indicates paracrine/autocrine roles. The Lep signaling system {{may be one of the}} pathways involved in feto-maternal cross-talk, implantation and maintenance of pregnancy, and may have a regulatory role around parturition...|$|E

The aim {{of the present study}} was to further elucidate, on a protein level, the downstream signaling pathway involved in P 4 regulation of oocyte developmental competence. COCs were subjected to IVM for 24 h in the presence or absence of trilostane, <b>aglepristone,</b> or promegestone (R 5020). These altered IVM conditions resulted in dynamic changes in protein expression of the progesterone receptors and the cell death-regulated proteins AVEN, BCL-xL, and active caspase 3. In addition, AVEN protein localization, caspase 3 activation, and mitochondrial distribution were studied by immunofluores-cence. Inhibition of progesterone synthesis (trilostane treatment) resulted in changes in AVEN localization within the COC, corresponding to caspase 3 activation and altered mitochondrial distribution.

40|$|Surgical uterine biopsies (SUBs) were {{obtained}} by laparotomy from 14 bitches with unexplained infertility whose pregnancy was not confirmed (NCP group) and from 7 bitches that had experienced unexplained pregnancy loss (PL). SUBs {{were obtained}} during the luteal phase of the cycle in 16 of 21 bitches. Overall, the biopsied uterine tissues presented obvious alterations in 17 of 21 cases. In the NCP group, 11 of 14 bitches had varying degrees of uterine lesions. In this group, six of nine bitches with macroscopically normal uteri presented histopathologic changes in the endometrium. All bitches with macroscopic modifications (five of 14) presented endometrial changes. Cytologic examination of the uterine fluid revealed eosinophilic amorphous material, erythrocytes, and a low number of degenerated leukocytes. On histopathologic examination, the most common lesion was fibrosis with degeneration of the endometrial glands (FDEGs six of 11), followed by endometritis (four of 11), cystic endometrial hyperplasia (CEH) (two of 11) and pseudoplacentational endometrial hyperplasia (PEH) (two of 11). Other lesions were adenomyosis, mucometra, and an endometrial polyp (one each of 11). Mixed lesions were present {{in four of the}} 11 bitches. In the PL group, macroscopic modifications consisted of intraluminal uterine dilatation (seven of seven) and presence of ovarian cysts (three of 7). Cytologic examination of the uterine content revealed high leukocyte counts. Histopathologic endometrial changes were found in six of seven bitches and included endometritis (three of seven), PEH (two of 6), pyometra (one of six), and CEH together with mucometra (one of six). Research of infectious agents was performed in 20 of 21 cases. Surprisingly, no bacteria or viruses were isolated from the uterine lumen in any of the cases. When the SUB was performed in diestrus, a medical treatment with <b>aglepristone</b> or with prostaglandins was established to avoid the risk of postoperative-induced pyometra. One case of complete uterine stenosis was the only side effect observed in the bitches that were not ovariohysterectomized after the collection of a biopsy (17 of 21). In conclusion, the most common findings in our biopsy specimens were FDEGs, endometritis, and hyperplastic remodeling of the endometrium (CEH and PEH). SUBs might provide useful information regarding the cause of infertility or PL. This technique allows visual inspection and palpation of the whole uterus and ovaries before the selection of a precise site for the biopsy. The size of the tissue sample collected can be large enough for an accurate diagnosis and samples for research of infectious agents can be obtained with no risk of contamination. Risk of side effects seems low when SUBs are performed according to this protocol, including postsurgery treatment with <b>aglepristone</b> or prostaglandins...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Estrogen and {{progesterone}} are potent breast mitogens. In {{addition to}} steroid hormones, multiple signaling pathways input to estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) actions via posttranslational events. Protein kinases commonly activated in breast cancers phosphorylate steroid hormone receptors (SRs) and profoundly impact their activities. Methods To {{better understand the}} role of modified PRs in breast cancer, we measured total and phospho-Ser 294 PRs in 209 human breast tumors represented on 2754 individual tissue spots within a tissue microarray and assayed the regulation of this site in human tumor explants cultured ex vivo. To complement this analysis, we assayed PR target gene regulation in T 47 D luminal breast cancer models following treatment with progestin (promegestone; R 5020) and antiprogestins (mifepristone, onapristone, or <b>aglepristone)</b> in conditions under which the receptor is regulated by Lys 388 SUMOylation (K 388 intact) or is SUMO-deficient (via K 388 R mutation to mimic persistent Ser 294 phosphorylation). Selected phospho-PR-driven target genes were validated by qRT-PCR and following RUNX 2 shRNA knockdown in breast cancer cell lines. Primary and secondary mammosphere assays were performed to implicate phospho-Ser 294 PRs, epidermal growth factor signaling, and RUNX 2 in breast cancer stem cell biology. Results Phospho-Ser 294 PR species were abundant in a majority (54 %) of luminal breast tumors, and PR promoter selectivity was exquisitely sensitive to posttranslational modifications. Phospho-PR expression and target gene programs {{were significantly associated with}} invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). Consistent with our finding that activated phospho-PRs undergo rapid ligand-dependent turnover, unique phospho-PR gene signatures were most prevalent in breast tumors clinically designated as PR-low to PR-null (luminal B) and included gene sets associated with cancer stem cell biology (HER 2, PAX 2, AHR, AR, RUNX). Validation studies demonstrated a requirement for RUNX 2 in the regulation of selected phospho-PR target genes (SLC 37 A 2). In vitro mammosphere formation assays support a role for phospho-Ser 294 -PRs via growth factor (EGF) signaling as well as RUNX 2 as potent drivers of breast cancer stem cell fate. Conclusions We conclude that PR Ser 294 phosphorylation is a common event in breast cancer progression that is required to maintain breast cancer stem cell fate, in part via cooperation with growth factor-initiated signaling pathways and key phospho-PR target genes including SLC 37 A 2 and RUNX 2. Clinical measurement of phosphorylated PRs should be considered a useful marker of breast tumor stem cell potential. Alternatively, unique phospho-PR target gene sets may provide useful tools with which to identify patients likely to respond to selective PR modulators that block PR Ser 294 phosphorylation as part of rational combination (i. e., with antiestrogens) endocrine therapies designed to durably block breast cancer recurrence...|$|E
40|$|Several {{pathological}} (e. g. {{obesity and}} chronic hypercortisolism) and non-pathological (e. g. ageing) states in humans {{are characterized by}} a reduction in pituitary growth hormone (GH) secretion. Chronic hypercortisolism in humans is also associated with an impaired GH response to various stimuli. Pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism in dogs is not only associated with less GH secreted per pulse but also with an impaired response to synthetic growth hormone secretagogues (GHSs) (Chapter 3 and 4). Both basal and stimulated GH secretion as well as circulating insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) concentrations decline with age in several mammalian species. Little is known about how age affects the GH response to GH-releasing stimuli in dogs. In Chapter 5 it is demonstrated that in young dogs, ghrelin - a recently discovered GHS of gastric origin - is a more potent stimulator of GH release than growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) or growth hormone-releasing peptide- 6 (GHRP- 6). In old dogs, GHRH administration causes higher elevations of plasma GH concentrations than ghrelin or GHRP- 6 administration. The GH-releasing capacity of ghrelin decreases with age whereas this decline is considerably lower for stimulation with GHRP- 6 or GHRH. Ghrelin and GHRP- 6 are specific releasers of GH. They do not stimulate the pituitary-adrenocortical axis nor the release of thyroid-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, or prolactin. The diagnosis of GH deficiency should be based upon {{the results of a}} stimulation test because basal plasma concentrations of GH and IGF-I may overlap between pituitary dwarfs and healthy individuals. A ghrelin-stimulation test may be used in the diagnosis of canine pituitary dwarfism (Chapter 6). Through activation of pathways distinct from those needed for GH secretion, ghrelin causes weight gain by increasing food intake and reducing fat utilization. In several mammalian species this gastric peptide seems {{to play a role in}} meal initiation. Chapter 7 is a report on investigations on the effects of food intake and fasting in healthy Beagle dogs. Fasting and food intake lead to higher and lower circulating ghrelin concentrations, respectively. During food intake and fasting, the changes in plasma ghrelin concentrations are not associated with similar changes in plasma GH concentrations. During food intake and fasting, circulating insulin and glucose concentrations change reciprocally with the ghrelin concentrations. In dogs, a pre-eminent example of extra-pituitary GH production is the progestin-induced synthesis in the mammary gland. In this species, mammary GH reaches the systemic circulation and may give rise to a syndrome of GH excess. Treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in healthy control dogs results in a higher basal plasma GH secretion and less GH secreted in pulses compared to dogs with surgically excised mammary gland tissue (Chapter 8). In both healthy dogs and mastectomized dogs, cystic endometrial hyperplasia (CEH) develops after one year treatment with MPA. Thus, progestin-induced mammary-derived GH is not a requirement for the development of CEH. The presence of immunoreactive GH in the cytoplasm of hyperplastic glandular uterine epithelial cells of dogs with CEH suggests that GH may play a role in the pathogenesis of CEH. In Chapter 9, an integral picture of the effects of progestins on the function of the adenohypophysis in the bitch is reported. The effect of MPA on gonadotrophin secretion is confined to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion. MPA treatment increases basal plasma FSH concentration during the first months of treatment, while the pituitary FSH response to supra-pituitary stimulation decreases during MPA administration. The results of the study reported in Chapter 10 indicate that the progesterone receptor blocker <b>aglépristone</b> allows for treatment of progestin-induced hypersomatotropism...|$|E
