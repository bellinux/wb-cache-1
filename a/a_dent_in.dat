The Deputy Keeper of the Jewel House took the regalia out of a {{cupboard}} {{and showed it to}} visitors for a small fee. This informal arrangement was ended two years later when Colonel Thomas Blood, an Irish-born army officer loyal to Parliament, attacked the 77-year-old and, with the help of three accomplices, stole a crown, a sceptre and an orb. They were apprehended at the perimeter, and the items were recovered, though some had been damaged: the crown was flattened with a mallet in an attempt to conceal it, and there was <b>a</b> <b>dent</b> <b>in</b> the orb. Blood was not only pardoned, but also given land and a pension. It has been suggested that he was a government spy. Ever since, the Jewels have been protected by armed guards.|$|E

25|$|It was {{not long}} before the scantily-clad Sabrina {{attracted}} the attention of the then all-male Amherst students. Around 1860, an industrious Amherst student, in the first of many Sabrina-inspired pranks, stole a set of undergarments from one of the nearby female colleges and used them to clothe Sabrina.

25|$|As {{that year}} began, Another World was {{expanded}} to 60 minutes, {{with their first}} hour-long episode airing on January 6, 1975. Although this did not directly affect As the World Turns, as the two shows were not in competition for {{anything other than the}} overall ratings win, CBS' afternoon lineup suffered some ratings damage as the popular soap put <b>a</b> <b>dent</b> <b>in</b> the ratings of both of CBS' popular afternoon game shows, The Price Is Right and Match Game. NBC, pleased by the success that the expansion of Another World had brought to the network, elected {{to do the same thing}} with Days of Our Lives beginning on April 21, 1975; this put Days of Our Lives and As the World Turns in direct competition for ratings. Incidentally, the expansions were occurring seven years after the last two 15-minute serials, Search for Tomorrow and The Guiding Light, expanded to 30 minutes.|$|E

25|$|Today Henry Hope is {{best known}} for his summer home, the Villa Welgelegen. Thanks to his command of English, French, and Dutch, he was adept at {{establishing}} far-flung business relationships, and he had many influential friends. He acquired a large art collection and built the villa Welgelegen in Haarlem to house the collection. The villa was erected on the grounds of a former summer home he had acquired in 1769 on the Haarlem border of Heemstede. Building this summer palace, a five-year project, became a summer attraction in its own right, rivaling the neighboring park, Groenendaal, established in Heemstede by his cousin, partner, and neighbor, Jan (John) Hope. In 1781, Henry started receiving uninvited visitors to view the gardens and expansion process. The execution of these ambitious plans did not seem to make <b>a</b> <b>dent</b> <b>in</b> his enormous wealth; in 1782, he purchased Hope Lodge (Fort Washington, Pennsylvania) as a wedding gift for the son of his American cousin, Maria Ellis.|$|E
25|$|The return {{game against}} was played {{a week later}} on 17 March 2016 at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium. Defender Adil Rami opened the scoring as he stooped to head a José Antonio Reyes corner in off the post. The match then slipped out of Basel's reach inside two minutes {{at the end of}} the first half. Reyes danced through the Basel defence and his low cross gave Kévin Gameiro an easy finish from close range. A minute later, Michael Krohn-Dehli {{advanced}} with a quick run and was the provider of the cross that found Gameiro. The striker's header came back off the underside of the crossbar and bounced in off his leg to make it 3–0 at half-time. Basel showed only small signs of a fightback. Luca Zuffi's effort from 25 yards out was still rising as it flew over the crossbar. Breel Embolo missed two chances late in the game as the Swiss side were dumped out of the competition. The result extended Sevilla's run of Europa League home wins to 11 – the longest in the competition's history and put <b>a</b> <b>dent</b> <b>in</b> Basel's impressive away record in Europe this season.|$|E
25|$|A.P. Hill's {{division}} {{had moved}} across Beaver Dam Creek {{early in the}} morning, finding the former Union line lightly defended. As they proceeded eastward and approached Gaines's Mill at {{about the time that}} D.H. Hill's men were engaged, Porter formally asked McClellan to send Slocum's division across the Chickahominy over Alexander's Bridge to support him. Hill directed the brigades of Maxcy Gregg and Lawrence O'Bryan Branch to spearhead the assault, as they had not been engaged at Beaver Dam Creek and were well-rested. Gregg was held up by skirmishers from Col. Hiram Berdan's 1st U.S. Sharpshooters and the 9th Massachusetts Infantry. By early afternoon, he ran into strong opposition by Porter, deployed along Boatswain's Creek and the swampy terrain was a major obstacle against the advance. A particularly bloody engagement occurred as the 1st South Carolina Rifles attacked a Massachusetts battery, but were repulsed by Zouaves of the 5th New York, which inflicted 57% casualties (76 killed, 221 wounded, and 58 missing) on the South Carolinians, the greatest Confederate regimental losses of the day. Branch's brigade fared no better, losing 401 men in two hours of fighting. Following behind them, Joseph R. Anderson's brigade launched three assaults on the Union lines without putting <b>a</b> <b>dent</b> <b>in</b> them. Field's brigade became bogged down in the swamp and some {{of the men in the}} rear ended up firing into their comrades. Some of Gregg's men reached the other side of the creek, none of the rest came close.|$|E

500|$|Nicol {{was signed}} by the St. Louis Browns {{near the end of}} the [...] season, even though he had no prior {{experience}} in minor league baseball. The team were in desperate need for players; their situation was a microcosm of the American Association (AA) that already had few players with major league experience to begin with. The league's precarious situation was not helped by the fact that they had to compete with both the well-established National League (NL) and the newly formed yet highly popular Players' League. [...] Although the latter league lasted just one season, they were able to outdraw both the AA and NL in terms of attendance. [...] This put <b>a</b> <b>dent</b> <b>in</b> the fortunes of the American Association, whose teams consequently struggled to pay the players' salaries and thus, had to utilize amateur, semi-professional or minor league players.|$|E

He was reelected as Mayor of Baltimore in 2003, and announced his candidacy for Governor in the 2006 election. The Baltimore Sun endorsed O'Malley, saying: [...] "When he was first elected mayor in 1999, the former two-term city councilman inherited a city of rising crime, failing schools, and shrinking economic prospects. He was able to reverse course {{in all of these}} areas." [...] The Washington Post criticized O'Malley for [...] "not solv the problems of rampant crime and rough schools in Baltimore", but further said that [...] "he put <b>a</b> <b>dent</b> <b>in</b> them.". O'Malley defeated incumbent Governor Bob Ehrlich 53%-46% in the November 7, 2006, general election. O'Malley defeated Ehrlich in the 2010 election 56%-42%, receiving just over one million votes.|$|E

500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray graded [...] "Earthling" [...] with a B. Unlike Isler, the A.V. Club {{reviewer}} {{loved the}} opening, calling it [...] "one of Fringes most effective freak-meets". Murray continued {{that he believed}} the episode to be [...] "an efficient action/adventure/horror hour, heavy on suspenseful moments and neat effects, light on character development and progress on the master-plot. When {{all is said and}} done and Fringe eventually ends its run, I'm betting that a newcomer will be able to skip 'Earthling' without putting <b>a</b> <b>dent</b> <b>in</b> their overall understanding of the show. But that doesn't mean it wasn't still cool to see people get reduced to dust right in front of our eyes. Jane Boursaw from AOL TV responded negatively to the episode, wishing it had not been yet another [...] "stand-alone creature feature". While praising the special effects, Boursaw expressed disinterest in learning more about Broyles and compared the Fringe case to something already done in The X-Files. She concluded, [...] "Take the creepy alien factor out of it, and this could have been any other police procedural". UGO Networks reviewer Alex Zalben also noted similarities to The X-Files, writing that [...] "the reason [...] is weird for Fringe is that, aforementioned evidence aside, they’ve been very careful to avoid the overarching alien mythology X-Files is famous for.
