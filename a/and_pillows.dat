5|$|Arranging a sleep {{environment}} that is quiet, very dark, and cool is recommended. Noises, light, and uncomfortable temperatures {{have been shown to}} disrupt continuous sleep.

40|$|A random {{allocation}} single blind block design pillow field study was undertaken {{to investigate the}} behaviour of cervico-thoracic spine pain in relation to pillow use. Participants (N = 106) who reported preference for side sleep position with one pillow were recruited via a telephone survey and newspaper advertisement. They recorded sleep quality <b>and</b> <b>pillow</b> comfort ratings, frequency of retiring and waking cervical pain and duration of waking cervical pain while sleeping for a week on their usual pillow, polyester, foam, feather <b>and</b> rubber <b>pillows</b> of regular shape and a foam contour pillow. Analysis was undertaken comparing sleep quality, <b>pillow</b> comfort, waking <b>and</b> temporal cervical pain reports, between the usual <b>pillow</b> <b>and</b> the trial <b>pillows,</b> between pillows of differing content <b>and</b> foam <b>pillows</b> of differing shape. This study provides evidence to support recommendation of rubber pillows {{in the management of}} waking cervical pain, and to improve sleep quality <b>and</b> <b>pillow</b> comfort. The rubber pillow performed better than subjects' own pillow in most instances. Subjects' own pillow performed similarly to foam <b>and</b> polyester <b>pillows,</b> <b>and</b> {{there is no evidence that}} the use of a foam contour pillow has advantages over the regular shaped pillows. Feather pillows should not be recommended...|$|R

25|$|Prior to the {{outbreak}} of the civil war in 1991, the roughly 53 state-owned small, medium and large manufacturing firms were foundering, with the ensuing conflict destroying many of the remaining industries. However, primarily as a result of substantial local investment by the Somali diaspora, many of these small-scale plants have re-opened and newer ones have been created. The latter include fish-canning and meat-processing plants in the northern regions, as well as about 25 factories in the Mogadishu area, which manufacture pasta, mineral water, confections, plastic bags, fabric, hides and skins, detergent and soap, aluminium, foam mattresses <b>and</b> <b>pillows,</b> fishing boats, carry out packaging, and stone processing.
