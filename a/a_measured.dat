5|$|An {{extreme example}} of an {{equatorial}} bulge is found on the star Regulus A (α Leonis A). The equator of this star has <b>a</b> <b>measured</b> rotational velocity of 317±3km/s. This corresponds to a rotation period of 15.9 hours, which is 86% of the velocity at which the star would break apart. The equatorial radius of this star is 32% larger than polar radius. Other rapidly rotating stars include Alpha Arae, Pleione, Vega and Achernar.|$|E
5|$|Similar to the {{mechanism}} of ethanol's effect, the increase of gas dissolved in nerve cell membranes may cause altered ion permeability properties of the neural cells' lipid bilayers. The partial pressure of a gas required to cause <b>a</b> <b>measured</b> degree of impairment correlates well with the lipid solubility of the gas: the greater the solubility, the less partial pressure is needed.|$|E
5|$|Amara was {{initially}} expected to track {{directly over the}} island of Rodrigues, prompting widespread precautionary measures and resulting in the issuance of a Class4 warning– denoting a warning of highest urgency– by the Mauritius Meteorological Services. Though the tropical cyclone eventually passed {{to the east of}} the island, Amara was close enough to Rodrigues to severely effect the island. Strong winds, peaking at <b>a</b> <b>measured</b> 152km/h (94mph) in Pointe Canon, resulted in widespread infrastructural damage, including the tearing of metal sheeting and uprooting of trees. Widespread power outage cut power to 12,000homes and shut off communications to and from the island. Heavy rains produced by Amara also triggered flooding in some locations and caused soil erosion.|$|E

50|$|AMSI is {{constructed}} using five variables. In descending order of weight they are: Price/Earnings Ratio, <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> of stock market valuations; Price Momentum, <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> of market psychology; Realized Volatility, <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> of recent historical risk; High Yield Bond Returns, <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> of credit risk; and the TED spread, <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> of systemic financial risk.

5|$|Another {{performance}} issue {{pertains to}} the choice of tempi, which is of special relevance in Schubert's major instrumental works, particularly in the opening movements. Schubert often notated his opening movements with moderate tempo indications, the extreme case being the Molto moderato of the B-flat piano sonata. The latter movement in particular, has been interpreted in vastly different speeds. Ever since the famous performances by Sviatoslav Richter, taking the opening movement at an extremely slow pace, similar tempo interpretations for this movement have been frequent. However, the majority of Schubert scholars tend to dismiss such an interpretation, arguing instead for a more flowing pace, <b>a</b> <b>measured</b> allegro.|$|E
5|$|Hubble {{has helped}} resolve some long-standing {{problems}} in astronomy, {{as well as}} raising new questions. Some results have required new theories to explain them. Among its primary mission targets was to measure distances to Cepheid variable stars more accurately than ever before, and thus constrain {{the value of the}} Hubble constant, the measure of {{the rate at which the}} universe is expanding, which is also related to its age. Before the launch of HST, estimates of the Hubble constant typically had errors of up to 50%, but Hubble measurements of Cepheid variables in the Virgo Cluster and other distant galaxy clusters provided <b>a</b> <b>measured</b> value with an accuracy of ±10%, which is consistent with other more accurate measurements made since Hubble's launch using other techniques. The estimated age is now about 13.7 billion years, but before the Hubble Telescope scientists predicted an age ranging from 10 to 20 billion years.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{members of}} the Kent Archaeological Rescue Unit {{conducted}} <b>a</b> <b>measured</b> survey of the monument. In 2005, Ashbee noted {{that he had found}} evidence of recent metal detectoring activity at the site. On 15 May 2007, the Kentish archaeologist Brian Philp was conducting his regular inspection of the monument when the property owner, Mrs Bygrave, pointed out to him an area where the road was beginning to subside. He alerted Kent County Council, who organised for contractors to investigate the reason for the subsidence, which proved to be decades of rabbit burrowing beneath the tarmac. Archaeologists from Kent Archaeological Unit visited the site during the work, discovering a buried sarsen; comparison with older records revealed that this stone had once been upright but had been buried where it stood in the 19th century by workmen who were replacing the trackway with a paved road.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} Test at Lord's Collingwood succumbed to a loose first-innings dismissal, {{chipping}} part-time spinner Michael Clarke to mid-on for 16 (and earning {{the ire of}} his captain Andrew Strauss, {{who went on to}} score 161); England, poised at 302 for 3 before Collingwood's dismissal, subsided to 425 all out. Nonetheless, England's seamers bowled Australia out for 215, and in the second innings Collingwood scored <b>a</b> <b>measured</b> 54, acting as foil to the aggressive strokeplay of Matt Prior (their partnership adding 86 in twelve overs) and Andrew Flintoff (51 in eight overs). As Flintoff and Graeme Swann combined to bowl England to victory, Collingwood contributed two fine slip catches.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of the nearby tropical cyclone caused the delaying of two flights and the cancellation of another at Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport. On Guam, the United States Navy ordered the release of ships from the local harbor. There, peaked at 251mm (9.90in) over a 24-hour period at Piti. At the National Weather Service office in Tiyan, a gauge observed 100mm (3.95in) of rain. Gusty winds were also associated with Saomai's outer rainbands, with gusts peaking at <b>a</b> <b>measured</b> 105km/h (66mph) on September4. The winds caused power outage in localized areas and downed two telephone poles. Severe flooding occurred in Merizo after a storm drain became clogged with debris, inundating six houses.|$|E

This normally had to be done within three days, and by 1897 only one claim per person at a time was allowed in a district, although married couples could exploit a loophole that allowed the wife to register a claim in her own name, doubling their amount of land.|$|E
