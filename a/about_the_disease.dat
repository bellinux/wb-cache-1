5|$|Most {{teachers}} {{are required to}} address HIV/AIDS in their curricula; although instructors are, for the most part, committed to helping their students understand and avoid the disease, they face many obstacles that prevent them from informing their students about HIV/AIDS in productive ways. For example, some teachers cannot advise their students to remain faithful to their sexual partners without seeming hypocritical because they engage in extramarital sexual relations themselves. Others feel uncomfortable discussing sexual matters with their students, and some believe that, due to their limited training, they are not knowledgeable enough about HIV/AIDS to direct classroom discussions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> In addition, many teachers feel unsupported by community members, who often either deny {{the extent of the}} epidemic or believe that HIV/AIDS should not be addressed in the classroom.|$|E

25|$|By law, all Saudi {{citizens}} who are infected with HIV or AIDS are entitled to free medical care, protection of their privacy and employment opportunities. The government has produced educational material on how the disease is spread and since the 1980s Abdullah al-Hokail, a Saudi doctor who specializes in the pandemic, {{has been allowed to}} air public service announcements on television <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> and how it is spread. Yet, ignorance, fear and prejudice are often directed at people living with the disease. While the government has designated several hospitals to treat those people infected with AIDS or HIV, other hospitals often refuse to care for such people or fail to treat them in a compassionate and humane manner. Hospitals and schools are often reluctant to distribute government information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> because of strong taboos and the stigma attached to how the virus can be spread.

40|$|Summary. In this study, the {{knowledge}} and attitudes of intern nursing students (n= 142) <b>about</b> <b>the</b> dermatologic <b>diseases</b> and their treatments were investigated. The infor-mations were collected by the students who {{are included in the}} study through question-naires.

However, they had missing information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> spreading man-ner of the infection, findings and treatment of <b>the</b> <b>disease,</b> and <b>the</b> pharmacologic features of the drugs used in <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> <b>The</b> expectations of the patients and the community of the nurses increases every day.
