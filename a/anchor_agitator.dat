40|$|A {{large number}} of chemicals, {{biochemical}} or petrochemical industry operations are performed in stirred tanks or in mechanically agitated vessels. The optimum operating mode of these equipments requires a detailed knowledge of the hydrodynamic behavior induced by the agitator. In this piece of work the characterization of the laminar viscous fluid flow fields in a cylindrical stirred tank is agitated by inclined blades <b>anchor</b> <b>agitator</b> studied. The computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model based on an implicit fractional step scheme and control volume method was developed for the spatial discretization of the Navier-Stokes, formulated in Cartesian coordinates primitives variables (u, v, p, T) on unstructured triangular mesh. Some simulations of the flow around an anchor with straights blades allowed validating the used method. We have analyzed {{the influence of the}} tilt blades degree on the hydrodynamic flow behaviors, such as the stream function, the velocity field, the velocities components, and the power consumption. The comparison between some of the obtained results with literature data, have showed a satisfactory agreement...|$|E
40|$|Methyl {{methacrylate}} is polymerized under near-isothermal {{conditions in}} a 1 -I stainless steel batch reactor having a glass bottom and stirred with an <b>anchor</b> <b>agitator.</b> A camcorder {{is used to}} obtain images of the entrapped vapor bubbles at different times so as to identify the point, Bi, where stable clusters of vapor bubbles first (incipient) get formed. This is being {{referred to as the}} transition point. Data on the monomer conversion, x(m,Bi), the weight average molecular weight, M(w),(BI), and the viscosity, eta(Bi), of the reaction mass at this point have been generated for a variety of experimental conditions. It is observed that the pressure above the liquid reaction mixture and the RPM of the stirrer have little effect on the results in the ranges studied. Correlations have been developed for x(m,Bi), M(W,Bi), and eta(Bi), relating these to the initiator loading, I(o), and the constant set-point temperature, T. Results are compared with those obtained earlier for reactors stirred with ribbon agitators. The transition point is useful for the design of the first stage of polymerization reactors. POLYM. ENG.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} hydrodynamics and power {{consumption}} in laminar stirred vessel flowusing numerical computation. The Metzner–Otto correlation was established for mixing in power-law fluids. This paper focuses on {{its application to}} yield stress fluids. Distributions of shear rates and their link to power consumption for helical and <b>anchor</b> <b>agitators</b> are discussed. Insight is sought from the analytical formula for Taylor–Couette flows. Laws are established for Bingham, Herschel-Bulkley and Casson fluids and reveal similar results. Fully or partially sheared flow situations with plug regions are considered. Depending on the fluid model, the concept is valid or constitutes a satisfactory approximation for fully sheared flows. When the flow is partially sheared, the expression depends on the Bingham number and the concept must be adapted. The results of the numerical simulations are interpreted {{in the light of}} this analysis and results from the literature...|$|R
