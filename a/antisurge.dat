It reports a non-linear dynamic model including a main forward compression line and two different configurations for the recycle <b>antisurge</b> line. Disturbance scenarios are proposed for testing the configurations and performance indicators are suggested to evaluate control performance and power consumption of the compression system. The paper demonstrates that compared to the hot recycle, the process configuration including a cold gas recycle has better overall stability, but higher power consumption and lower values for the control performance indicators. Based on the previous considerations, the paper gives suggestions regarding {{the choice of the}} recycle configuration. Moreover it compares subcritical and supercritical compression during surge prevention and highlights the importance of the selection of the gas recycle configuration when full recycle is needed...|$|E

It has become a powerful tool {{in the design of}} compressor <b>antisurge</b> protection, evaluation of operation envelope, driver size selection, field support, and troubleshooting. Recent developments in the simulator technology make it possible to develop large-scale dynamic simulation models and use them in the entire project life-cycle. This paper discusses the basic scope of dynamic simulation, typical application areas, and several case studies. The case studies are based {{on a wide range of}} applications, including conceptual feasibility study, detailed engineering, equipment specification, precommissioning, and field support. These case studies cover different compressor lineups, such as axial and centrifugal compressors and parallel operations. One example shows how a dynamic model was used to identify critical design issues at the early stage of engineering phase to avoid design or field problems at a later date. Other examples show how dynamic simulation was used to evaluate design alternatives and ultimately improve overall compressor operation and protection...|$|E
40|$|All {{water systems}} leak, and many supply systems do so considerably, with water losses {{typically}} of approximately 20 % {{of the water}} production. The IWA Water Loss Task Force aims for a significant reduction of annual water losses by drafting documents to assist practitioners and others to prevent, monitor and mitigate water losses in water transmission and distribution systems. One {{of the causes of}} water losses are transient phenomena, caused by normal and accidental pump and valve operations. A number of excellent books on fluid transients have been written, but there is still a need for practical guidance on the hydraulic analysis of municipal water systems in order to reduce or counteract the adverse effects of transient pressures. The need for guidelines on pressure transients is not only motivated by its positive effect on water losses, but also by the contribution to safe, cost-effective and energy saving operation of water distribution systems. This paper overviews the emergency scenarios to be considered and the integrated design of control systems and <b>antisurge</b> services, which will lead to a more cost-effective, robust, reliable and water tight supply system.

40|$|Model {{predictive}} control (MPC) techniques are considered for industrial centrifugal compression systems with nonlinear dynamics, to address process and <b>antisurge</b> control for reaching the desired pressure ratio and surge distance. We consider a contractive nonlinear MPC formulation that ensures asymptotic {{stability of the}} closed-loop system by imposing the decrease of a quadratic Lyapunov function via an additional constraint. We discuss recursive feasibility and estimate the region of attraction via numerical methods. We also consider alternative MPC formulations, including offset-free linear and nonlinear MPC to handle the effects of disturbances and unmodeled dynamics. The computational efficiency of an approximation based on sequential quadratic programming (SQP), that yields a closed-loop performance comparable to the full nonlinear MPC is also discussed. All of the controllers considered are tested in simulations that emulate a realistic test bench and their computational time is assessed on an industrial Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). Their performance is compared with standard industrial control in nominal and perturbed cases replicating the typical and critical disturbances and model mismatches. The numerical {{results show that the}} SQP and nonlinear MPC methods outperform the other controllers in the considered scenarios, based on closed-loop performance metrics for the surge margin, the reference tracking accuracy, and the system actuation, without significantly increasing the computational time...|$|E
40|$|As {{one of the}} <b>antisurge</b> techniques, the {{adjusting}} {{scheme of}} VSV under off-design conditions has {{a significant impact on}} the performance of gas turbines. In this paper, the one-dimensional characteristic of the compressor calculation program is embedded into the zero-dimensional overall gas turbine model, which replaces the original compressor characteristic module. Based on the assembling relationship of the actual components of the marine gas turbine, the architecture of the modular model library is designed, and an integrated simulation platform of marine gas turbine is developed by using MATLAB/GUI software. The influence of the first 3 rows of variable stator vanes of the 9 -stage axial compressor working alone on the performance of the compressor at different speeds and different angles was analyzed by the HARIKA compressor characteristic calculation program. Taking the economics and stability of the gas turbine as the optimization objective, the optimization of the first three-stage stator vanes regulation schemes under different working conditions was carried out. The steady-state performance parameters under each working condition of gas turbine of power generation with or without variable stator vane mode were calculated. The study results can provide references for the adjusting scheme of VSV under gas turbine off-design conditions operating process...|$|E
40|$|TutorialMany {{facilities}} employ {{two or more}} centrifugal compressors, {{operated in}} either series or parallel configurations. An accurately designed surge control system that includes multiple compressors with the associated piping systems is a vital element of a facility?s design and ongoing operational integrity. The design must ensure compressors are not subjected to damaging fast dynamic events leading to large capital costs and significant down time for operators. Examples of such fast dynamic events are those following emergency shutdown (ESD) of fast stop of one or all compressor units in a station. Typical studies are not accurate enough to capture the complex interactions leading to catastrophic events, especially for complicated system arrangements. This paper introduces three methods of surge control analysis that can be conducted to assess the effectiveness of any surge control system design to prevent the compressor from surge. The first method utilizes the perturbation theory to relate the compressor deceleration and the resulting drop in its flow and head to determine the elapsed time that the compressor can stay out of surge before the surge control system brings about enough positive flow to prevent the unit from undergoing deep surge. The second method is simpler, {{and is based on}} a dimensionless number, called the inertia number, which combines the salient parameters from the dynamic equation between the fluid energy and that of the compressor rotor inertia to determine, as a first cut check, if the surge control system is adequate. The third method, which is always recommended, and is based on solving the full gas dynamic partial differential equations (PDEs) in spatial and temporal domain, which describe the true dynamic characteristics of the flow through the various piping elements, the compressor itself, to provide much more accurate predictions of surge control system behavior during fast transient events. Comparisons are made to field measurements to provide model validations, and an example application (Case Study) of three units operating in parallel. The first two (Units 6 and 7) were existing in a compressor station, while the third (Unit 8) was an add-on. The addition of Unit 8 meant a number of station layout modifications, which included: re-wheeling of Units 6 and 7 (i. e., change the compressor impellers); adding after gas cooling; and relocating the anti-surge valves downstream of the coolers to allow for both hot (fast stop) and cold recycle (anti-surge) capabilities. Due to the addition of equipment and significant reconfiguration of station piping and valves, a dynamic surge analysis on Units 6, 7, and 8 was required to determine whether the existing anti-surge and fast stop valves were adequately sized and whether the anti-surge valves could be relocated downstream of the gas coolers. A new fast stop recycle system was added along with Unit 8, which also needed to be adequately sized. Further complications arose from the fact that Unit 6 ?s anti-surge valve configuration differs from that of Unit 7 and that Unit 6 has twin recycle valves jointly serving as anti-surge valves with a single fast stop valve while Unit 7 has a single <b>antisurge</b> valve and a single fast stop valve...|$|E
