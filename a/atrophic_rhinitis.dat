5000|$|P. multocida {{causes a}} range of {{diseases}} in wild and domesticated animals, as well as humans. The bacterium {{can be found in}} birds, cats, dogs, rabbits, cattle, and pigs. In birds, P. multocida causes avian or fowl cholera disease; a significant disease present in commercial and domestic poultry flocks worldwide, particularly layer flocks and parent breeder flocks. P. multocida strains that cause fowl cholera in poultry typically belong to the serovars 1, 3, and 4. In the wild, fowl cholera has been shown to follow bird migration routes, especially of snow geese. The P. multocida serotype-1 is most associated with avian cholera in North America, but the bacterium does not linger in wetlands for extended periods of time. [...] P. multocida causes <b>atrophic</b> <b>rhinitis</b> in pigs; it also can cause pneumonia or bovine respiratory disease in cattle. [...] In humans, P. multocida is {{the most common cause of}} infection from wound infections after dog or cat bites. The infection usually shows as soft tissue inflammation within 24 hours. High leukocyte and neutrophil counts are typically observed, leading to an inflammatory reaction at the infection site (generally a diffuse, localized cellulitis). [...] It can also infect other locales, such as the respiratory tract, and is known to cause regional lymphadenopathy (swelling of the lymph nodes). In more serious cases, a bacteremia can result, causing an osteomyelitis or endocarditis. The bacteria may also cross the blood-brain barrier and cause meningitis.|$|E
5000|$|P. multocida mutants {{are being}} {{researched}} {{for their ability}} to cause diseases. In vitro experiments show the bacteria respond to low iron. Vaccination against progressive <b>atrophic</b> <b>rhinitis</b> was developed by using a recombinant derivative of P. multocida toxin. The vaccination was tested on pregnant gilts (female swine without previous litters). The piglets born to treated gilts were inoculated, while the piglets born to unvaccinated mothers developed atrophic rhinitis.Other research is being done on the effects of protein, pH, temperature, NaCl, and sucrose on P. multocida development and survival in water. The research seems to show the bacteria survive better in 18 °C water compared to 2 °C water. The addition of 0.5% NaCl also aided bacterial survival, while the sucrose and pH levels had minor effects, as well. [...] Research has also been done on the response of P. multocida to the host environment. These tests use DNA microarrays and proteomics techniques. P. multocida-directed mutants have been tested {{for their ability to}} produce disease. Findings seem to indicate the bacteria occupy host niches that force them to change their gene expression for energy metabolism, uptake of iron, amino acids, and other nutrients. In vitro experiments show the responses of the bacteria to low iron and different iron sources, such as transferrin and hemoglobin. P. multocida genes that are upregulated in times of infection are usually involved in nutrient uptake and metabolism. This shows true virulence genes may only be expressed during the early stages of infection.|$|E
5000|$|P. multocida {{expresses a}} range of {{virulence}} factors including a polysaccharide capsule and the variable carbohydrate surface molecule, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The capsule {{has been shown in}} strains belonging to serogroups A and B to help resist phagocytosis by host immune cells and capsule type A has also been shown to help resist complement-mediated lysis. The LPS produced by P. multocida consists of a hydrophobic lipid A molecule (that anchors the LPS to the outer membrane), an inner core, and an outer core, both consisting of a series of sugars linked in a specific way. There is no O-antigen on the LPS and the molecule is similar to LPS produced by Haemophilus influenzae and the lipooligosaccharide of Neisseria meningitidis. A study in a serovar 1 strain showed that a full-length LPS molecule was essential for the bacteria to be fully virulent in chickens. [...] Strains that cause <b>atrophic</b> <b>rhinitis</b> in pigs are unique as they also have P. multocida toxin (PMT) residing on a bacteriophage. PMT is responsible for the twisted snouts observed in pigs infected with the bacteria. This toxin activates Rho GTPases, which bind and hydrolyze GTP, and are important in actin stress fiber formation. Formation of stress fibers may aid in the endocytosis of P. multocida. The host cell cycle is also modulated by the toxin, which can act as an intracellular mitogen. [...] P. multocida has been observed invading and replicating inside host amoebae, causing lysis in the host. P. multocida will grow at 37 °C on blood or chocolate agar,HS agar, but will not grow on MacConkey agar.Colony growth is accompanied by a characteristic [...] "mousy" [...] odor due to metabolic products. Being a facultative anaerobe, it is oxidase-positive and catalase-positive, and can also ferment a large number carbohydrates in anaerobic conditions. [...] The survival of P. multocida bacteria has also been shown to be increased by the addition of salt into their environments. Levels of sucrose and pH also have been shown to have minor effects on bacterial survival.|$|E

Surgery, {{although}} seen as minimally invasive because no external incisions are visible, is often very aggressive and destructive to the nasal structures. The {{removal of the}} nasal turbinates has always been seen as sacrilege due {{to the risk of}} developing <b>atrophic</b> <b>rhinitis.</b> If the theory regarding developing <b>atrophic</b> <b>rhinitis</b> after a simple turbinectomy stands true, one would expect a high incidence of <b>atrophic</b> <b>rhinitis</b> after radical resection of the sinonasal structures. This has not been our experience. METHODS: The study population includes a retrospective case review of all patients that had endoscopic sinonasal tumour resection by the same surgeon between 2006 and 2010. All patients were assessed for symptoms and signs suggestive of <b>atrophic</b> <b>rhinitis</b> up to two years post resection. RESULTS: 51 patients (34 M: 17 F) were included in the study. Patients with residual or recurrent tumour (n= 19) and patients who had received adjuvant radiotherapy (n= 17) had a statistically significant chance of developing symptoms and signs suggestive of <b>atrophic</b> <b>rhinitis</b> over time. Variables such as age, gender, extent of surgery, bilateral disease, benign or malignant tumour, were not statistically significant in the development of symptoms and signs suggestive of <b>atrophic</b> <b>rhinitis</b> over time.
