5|$|Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo, born Joseph-Casimir on 4 March 1901 or 1903 in Ambatofotsy (north of Antananarivo), Madagascar, was {{the only}} child of an unwed mother descended from the Zanadralambo ("sons of Ralambo") caste of the Merina andriana (nobles). When the French colonized Madagascar in 1897, Merina nobles {{including}} Rabearivelo's mother lost the privileges, prestige, and wealth to which they had been entitled under the former monarchy, the Kingdom of Imerina. Madagascar had been a French colony for less than a decade when Rabearivelo was born, situating him among the first generation of Malagasy to grow up under the colonial system. He first studied at the Frères des Écoles Chrétiennes school in the affluent neighborhood of Andohalo, then transferred to the prestigious Collège Saint-Michel, where he was expelled for lack of discipline, poor <b>academic</b> <b>performance,</b> <b>and</b> his reluctance to become religiously observant. He ended his studies at École Flacourt in 1915. He is believed to have published his first poems at age 14 in the literary review Vakio Ity under the pen name K. Verbal.|$|E

He subsequently attended Ntare School, one of the best schools in Uganda. It is also the alma mater of future Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. The death of Kagame's father in the early 1970s, and the departure of Rwigyema to an unknown location, led to a decline in his <b>academic</b> <b>performance</b> <b>and</b> an increased tendency to fight those who belittled the Rwandan population.

25|$|Studying bilingual {{acquisition}} {{is important}} because it may have real effects on academic performances for bilingual children in school.

Despite these differences, have suggested that bilingual children are not necessarily disadvantaged in academic performance or academic spoken language because they have a good grasp on the language used for their academics. Regardless, home vocabulary is still relevant to academic life, and it is important to get a better balance in vocabulary acquisition to be able to effectively communicate in both languages.|$|E

40|$|This study {{attempts}} to determine kinesthetic, verbal and visual intelligences among mechanical engineering undergraduate students and explores any probable relation with students’ learning styles <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> <b>performance.</b> The questionnaire {{used in this}} study is based on Howard Gardner’s multiple intelligences theory comprising of five elements of learning style; environmental, sociological, emotional, physiological and psychological. Questionnaires are distributed amongst undergraduates in the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering. Additional questions on students’ perception of learning styles <b>and</b> their <b>academic</b> <b>performance</b> are included in the questionnaire. The results show that one third of the students are strongly dominant in the kinesthetic intelligent (33 %), followed by a combination of kinesthetic and visual intelligences (29 %) and 21 % are strongly dominant in all three types of intelligences. There is a statistically significant correlation between kinesthetic, verbal and visual intelligences and students learning styles <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> <b>performances.</b> The ANOVA analysis supports that there is a significant relationship between <b>academic</b> <b>performances</b> <b>and</b> level of kinesthetic, verbal and visual intelligences. In addition, it has also proven a remarkable relationship between <b>academic</b> <b>performances</b> <b>and</b> kinesthetic, verbal and visual learning styles amongst the male and female students. Thus, it can be concluded that, academic achievements can be enhanced by understanding as well as capitalizing the students’ types of intelligences and learning styles...|$|R
40|$|Objectives To {{analyze the}} {{associations}} between different components of fitness <b>and</b> fatness with <b>academic</b> <b>performance,</b> adjusting the analysis by sex, age, socio-economic status, region and school type in a Chilean sample. Methods Data of fitness, fatness <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> <b>performance</b> {{was obtained from}} the Chilean System for the Assessment of Educational Quality test for eighth grade in 2011 and includes a sample of 18, 746 subjects (49 % females). Partial correlations adjusted by confounders were done to explore association between fitness and fatness components, and between the academic scores. Three unadjusted and adjusted linear regression models were done in order to analyze the associations of variables. Results Fatness has a negative association with <b>academic</b> <b>performance</b> when Body Mass Index (BMI) and Waist to Height Ratio (WHR) are assessed independently. When BMI and WHR are assessed jointly and adjusted by cofounders, WHR is more associated with <b>academic</b> <b>performance</b> than BMI, <b>and</b> only the association of WHR is positive. For fitness components, strength was the variable most associated with the <b>academic</b> <b>performance.</b> Cardiorespiratory capacity was not associated with <b>academic</b> <b>performance</b> if fatness <b>and</b> other fitness components are included in the model. Conclusions Fitness and fatness are associated with <b>academic</b> <b>performance.</b> WHR <b>and</b> strength are more related with <b>academic</b> <b>performance</b> than BMI <b>and</b> cardiorespiratory capacity...|$|R

Two studies examining the effect of exposure to an American Indian sports mascot found a tendency to endorse stereotypes of a different minority group (Asian Americans), which is indicative of a [...] "spreading effect". Exposure to any stereotypes increased the likelihood of stereotypical thinking; demonstrating the harm done to society by stereotyping of any kind.

500|$|The {{issue is}} often {{discussed}} in the media in terms of offensiveness or political correctness, which reduces it to feelings and opinions, and prevents full understanding of the historical, psychological and sociological context provided by academic research on {{the negative effects of}} the use of Native American names and images by sports teams. The effect of stereotyping on high or low expectations, confidence, and academic performance has been well-established. This effect is enhanced due to the invisibility of Native Americans in mainstream society and media, leaving stereotypes as the primary basis for thinking about the abilities and traits associated with Natives, including the roles and opportunities Natives Americans envision for themselves. Furthermore, even when stereotypes are positive (e.g. [...] "Natives Americans are spiritual"), they may have a limiting, detrimental effect on individuals. Stereotyping may directly affect the <b>academic</b> <b>performance</b> <b>and</b> self-esteem of Native American youth, whose people face high rates of suicide, unemployment, and poverty. Euro-Americans exposed to mascots {{may be more likely to}} believe not only that such stereotypes are true, but that Native Americans have no identity beyond these stereotypes. Research indicates that exposure to any stereotypes increased the likelihood of stereotypical thinking with regard to other minority groups in addition to the target of the stereotype, a [...] "spreading effect".|$|E

This research explored (both theoretically and empirically) the relationships between EAA, <b>academic</b> <b>performances</b> <b>and</b> employability (the perceived likelihood of graduates to fi nd a job). According to quantitative empirical data, participation in EAA improves <b>academic</b> <b>performances</b> <b>and</b> although participation in EAA requires {{the same amount of}} time as normal coursework, the two activities seem to be in accordance with each other.

The positive opinion regarding how EAA participation contributes toward fi nding a job can be ex plained by the perception that participation in EAA increases professional abilities, while EAA might represent a more convincing argument for employers than <b>academic</b> <b>performances.</b> Furthermore, the qualitative data shows that the professional and academic competencies (abilities) improved by participating in AAE coincide with the expectations of potential employers and that the overall quality of academic programs could be improved by institutionalizing EAA, multiplying and diversifying these activities, including strategic partners, and so on.   </div...|$|R
