50|$|Force Spectrum Microscopy (FSM) is an {{application}} of active microrheology developed to measure aggregate random forces in the cytoplasm.

The magnitude of these random forces can be inferred from the frequency of oscillation of tracer particles. Tracking the fluctuations of tracer particles using optical microscopy can isolate the contribution of active random forces to intracellular molecular transport from that of Brownian motion.|$|E

Whereas DnaB-like helicases unwind DNA as ring-shaped hexamers, other enzymes {{have been shown}} to be active as monomers or dimers. Studies have shown that helicases may act passively, waiting for uncatalyzed unwinding to take place and then translocating between displaced strands, or can play an active role in catalyzing strand separation using the energy generated in ATP hydrolysis. In the latter case, the helicase acts comparably to an <b>active</b> <b>motor,</b> unwinding and translocating along its substrate as a direct result of its ATPase activity. Helicases may process much faster in vivo than in vitro due to the presence of accessory proteins that aid in the destabilization of the fork junction.|$|E
5000|$|DOMS {{was first}} {{described}} in 1902 by Theodore Hough, who concluded {{that this kind}} of soreness is [...] "fundamentally the result of ruptures within the muscle". According to this [...] "muscle damage" [...] theory of DOMS, these ruptures are microscopic lesions at the Z-line of the muscle sarcomere. The soreness has been attributed to the increased tension force and muscle lengthening from eccentric exercise. This may cause the actin and myosin cross-bridges to separate prior to relaxation, ultimately causing greater tension on the remaining <b>active</b> <b>motor</b> units. This increases the risk of broadening, smearing, and damage to the sarcomere. When microtrauma occurs to these structures, nociceptors (pain receptors) within muscle connective tissues are stimulated and cause the sensation of pain.|$|E
50|$|FSM was {{developed}} by Ming Guo and David A. Weitz to probe stochastic intracellular forces generated by motor proteins. Far from a liquid void, the cytoplasm contains a complex meshwork of actin and myosin conferring structural support to the cell, as well as harbouring vesicles and mitochondria among other organelles. Recent research on the macromolecular crowding inside the cytoplasm raises concerns whether diffusive-like motion of large molecules have been mistakenly attributed to Brownian forces. Instead, there are suspicions that myosin motor proteins, which tug randomly on the actin filaments embedded with large molecules, give rise to diffusive-like motion of molecules inside cells. Guo et al. developed an assay to distinguish whether particle motion inside cells are driven by thermal diffusion or by repercussions from <b>active</b> <b>motor</b> proteins like non-muscle myosin II shaking the cellular cytoskeleton.|$|E

50|$|Kinesins are a {{group of}} related motor {{proteins}} that use a microtubule track in anterograde movement. They are vital to spindle formation in mitotic and meiotic and chromosomes separation during cell division and are also responsible for shuttling mitochondria, Golgi bodies, and vesicles within eukaryotic cells. Kinesin have two heavy chains and two light chains per <b>active</b> <b>motor.</b> The two globular head motor domains in heavy chains can convert the chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis into mechanical work to move along microtubules. The direction in which cargo is transported can be towards the plus-end or the minus-end, {{depending on the type}} of kinesin. In general, kinesins with N-terminal motor domains move their cargo towards the plus ends of microtubules located at the cell periphery, while kinesins with C-terminal motor domains move cargo towards the minus ends of microtubules located at the nucleus. Fourteen distinct kinesin families are known, with some additional kinesin-like proteins that cannot be classified into these families.|$|E
50|$|In rats, {{the most}} {{frequently}} studied species, theta wave rhythmicity is easily observed in the hippocampus, but can also be detected in numerous other cortical and subcortical brain structures. Hippocampal theta waves, with a frequency range of 6-10 Hz, appears when a rat is engaged in <b>active</b> <b>motor</b> behavior such as walking or exploratory sniffing, and also during REM sleep. Theta waves with a lower frequency range, usually around 6-7 Hz, are sometimes observed when a rat is motionless but alert. When a rat is eating, grooming, or sleeping, the hippocampal EEG usually shows a non-rhythmic pattern known as Large irregular activity or LIA. The hippocampal theta rhythm depends critically on projections from the medial septal area, which in turn receives input from the hypothalamus and several brainstem areas. Hippocampal theta rhythms in other species differ in some respects from those in rats. In cats and rabbits, the frequency range is lower (around 4-6 Hz), and theta is less strongly associated with movement than in rats. In bats, theta appears in short bursts associated with echolocation. In humans, hippocampal theta rhythm has been observed and linked to memory formation and navigation.|$|E

40|$|How {{intracellular}} transport {{controls the}} probability that cargos switch at intersections between filaments is not well understood. In one hypothesis some motors on the cargo attach to one filament while others attach to the intersecting filament, and the ensuing tug-of-war determines which filament is chosen. We investigate this hypothesis using 3 D computer simulations, and discover that switching at intersections increases {{with the number of}} motors on the cargo, but is not strongly dependent on motor number when the filaments touch. Thus, simply controlling the number of <b>active</b> <b>motors</b> on the cargo cannot account for in vivo observations that found reduced switching with increasing motor number, suggesting additional mechanisms of regulation. We use simulations to show that one possible way to regulate switching is by simultaneously adjusting the separation between planes containing the crossing filaments and the total number of <b>active</b> <b>motors</b> on the cargo. Heretofore, the effect of filament-filament separation on switching has been unexplored. We find that the switching probability decreases with increasing filament separation. This effect is particularly strong for cargos with only a modest number of motors. As the filament separation increases past the maximum head-to-head distance of the motor, individual motors walking along a filament will be unable to reach the intersecting filament. Thus, any switching requires that other motors on the cargo attach to the intersecting filament and haul the cargo along it, while motor(s) engaged on the original filament detach. Further, if the filament separation is large enough, the cargo can have difficult...|$|R

Immediately after the shutting, {{a large amount}} of 86 Rb pre-loaded in the trap-lobes was detected in the hollow space inside the shut trap. This may indicate that much of the K+ in the <b>active</b> <b>motor</b> cells leaks out during the shutting, resulting in turgor loss in the cells. 86 Rb(K+) uptake in the trap was active. During the opening process, enhanced 86 Rb uptake was observed. The time course of this uptake was {{similar to that of the}} opening of the trap-lobes, and both courses were accelerated by IAA.

40|$|Copyright © 2006 the American Physiological SocietyRepetitive {{transcranial}} magnetic {{stimulation of}} the motor cortex (rTMS) {{can be used to}} modify motor cortical excitability in human subjects. At stimulus intensities near to or above resting motor threshold, low-frequency rTMS (1 Hz) decreases motor cortical excitability, whereas high-frequency rTMS (5 – 20 Hz) can increase excitability. We investigated the effect of 10 min of intermittent rTMS on motor cortical excitability in normal subjects at two frequencies (2 or 6 Hz). Three low intensities of stimulation (70, 80, and 90 % of <b>active</b> <b>motor</b> threshold) and sham stimulation were used. The number of stimuli were matched between conditions. Motor cortical excitability was investigated by measurement of the motor-evoked potential (MEP) evoked by single magnetic stimuli in the relaxed first dorsal interosseus muscle. The intensity of the single stimuli was set to evoke baseline MEPs of 1 mV in amplitude. Both 2 - and 6 -Hz stimulation, at 80 % of <b>active</b> <b>motor</b> threshold, reduced the magnitude of MEPs for 30 min (P < 0. 05). MEPs returned to baseline values after a weak voluntary contraction. Stimulation at 70 and 90 % of <b>active</b> <b>motor</b> threshold and sham stimulation did not induce a significant group effect on MEP magnitude. However, the intersubject response to rTMS at 90 % of <b>active</b> <b>motor</b> threshold was highly variable, with some subjects showing significant MEP facilitation and others inhibition. These results suggest that, at low stimulus intensities, the intensity of stimulation may be as important as frequency in determining the effect of rTMS on motor cortical excitability.

40|$|AbstractLong-range {{directional}} transport {{in cells}} is facilitated by microtubule-based motor proteins. One example is transport in a nerve cell, where {{small groups of}} motor proteins, such as kinesins and cytoplasmic dynein, work together to ensure the supply and clearance of cellular material along the axon. Defects in axonal transport {{have been linked to}} Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, it is not known in detail how multimotor-based cargo transport is impaired if a fraction of the motors are defective. To mimic impaired multimotor transport in vitro, we performed gliding motility assays with varying fractions of <b>active</b> kinesin- 1 <b>motors</b> and inactive kinesin- 1 motor mutants. We found that impaired transport manifests in multiple motility regimes: 1), a fast-motility regime characterized by gliding at velocities close to the single-molecule velocity of the active motors; 2), a slow-motility regime characterized by gliding at close-to zero velocity or full stopping; and 3), a regime in which fast and slow motilities coexist. Notably, the transition from the fast to the slow regime occurred sharply at a threshold fraction of <b>active</b> <b>motors.</b> Based on single-motor parameters, we developed a stochastic model and a mean-field theoretical description that explain our experimental findings. Our results demonstrate that impaired multimotor transport mostly occurs in an either/or fashion: depending on the ratio of <b>active</b> to inactive <b>motors,</b> transport is either performed at close to full speed or is out of action...|$|R
