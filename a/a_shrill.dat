5|$|The striped honeyeater's song is {{described}} as a chirp, chirp, cherry, cherry, its contact call as a sharp chewee and its alarm call as <b>a</b> <b>shrill</b> whistling note.|$|E
5|$|Young have <b>a</b> <b>shrill</b> closed-bill call, {{which they}} use in begging and to contact their parents. They {{also have a}} long call used in {{response}} to (and similar to that of) the long call of adults.|$|E
5|$|The highest notes {{can have}} <b>a</b> <b>shrill,</b> {{piercing}} quality {{and can be}} difficult to tune accurately. Different instruments often play differently in this respect due to the sensitivity of the bore and reed measurements. Using alternate fingerings and adjusting the embouchure help correct the pitch of these notes.|$|E
6000|$|... "And all of {{a sudden}} I missed Baby," [...] {{continued}} Mrs. Momeby in <b>a</b> <b>shriller</b> tone. [...] "We've hunted high and low, in house and garden and outside the gates, and he's nowhere to be seen." ...|$|R
60|$|Again Mr. Haswell {{made the}} sound of wind among wires, only {{this time there was}} <b>a</b> <b>shriller</b> note in it; its {{mellowness}} was gone, it was as though the air had suddenly been filled with frost.|$|R
60|$|The sight was {{received}} with a shout by the men, <b>a</b> <b>shriller</b> shout by the women, and a screech of surprise and delight by little Olaf, who {{would certainly have}} gone over the side in his eagerness, had not Biarne caught him by the skirts of his tunic.|$|R
5|$|River otters {{can produce}} a snarling growl or hissing bark when bothered, and <b>a</b> <b>shrill</b> whistle when in pain. When at play or traveling, they {{sometimes}} give off low, purring grunts. The alarm call, given when shocked or distressed by potential danger, is an explosive snort, made by expelling air through the nostrils. River otters also may use a birdlike chirp for communication over longer distances, but the most common sound heard {{among a group of}} otters is low-frequency chuckling.|$|E
5|$|The least weasel {{has four}} basic vocalisations; a {{guttural}} hiss emitted when alarmed, which is interspersed with short screaming barks and shrieks when provoked. When defensive, it emits <b>a</b> <b>shrill</b> wail or squeal. During encounters {{between males and}} females or between a mother and kits, the least weasel emits a high-pitched trilling. The least weasel's way of expressing aggression {{is similar to that of}} the stoat. Dominant weasels exhibit lunges and shrieks during aggressive encounters, while subdominant weasels will emit submissive squeals.|$|E
5|$|Like other nuthatches, {{this is a}} noisy {{species with}} a range of vocalizations. The male's mating song is a rapid nasal qui-qui-qui-qui-qui-qui-qui. The contact call between members of a pair, given most {{frequently}} in the fall and winter is a thin squeaky nit, uttered up to 30 times a minute. A more distinctive sound is <b>a</b> <b>shrill</b> kri repeated rapidly with mounting anxiety or excitement kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri; the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin subspecies have a higher, faster yididitititit call, and Pacific birds a more nasal beeerf.|$|E
60|$|Sam was so {{lost in the}} {{contemplation of}} this {{comfortable}} scene, that he suffered the first inquiry of the rather stout lady to pass unheeded. It was not until it had been twice repeated, each time in <b>a</b> <b>shriller</b> tone, that he became conscious of the impropriety of his behaviour.|$|R
6000|$|Then, {{from the}} deeps of his mind, {{where he had}} stowed away all his {{discarded}} information, rose to light the scientific fact of the Easterly journey. On the next occasion that his uncle shouted up the stairway urging him to make haste and live, <b>a</b> <b>shriller</b> voice cried, 'Who goes round the world once easterly, gains one day.' ...|$|R
60|$|Then Randal {{tugged at}} the cloths, and then they all heard <b>a</b> little <b>shrill</b> cry.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Desmond and Locke {{discuss the}} purpose of the {{stations}} and discover that when Desmond accidentally allowed the timer to run out, the magnetic force pulled Oceanic Flight 815 toward the island, thus causing the crash. Locke continues to doubt that the timer has any meaning, but Desmond assures him that it is all real. As the timer passes zero, Desmond retrieves a failsafe key and crawls underneath the hatch, saying he will blow the dam. After he turns the key in the system termination switch, <b>a</b> <b>shrill</b> humming noise and violet-white light envelops the entire island, causing the Oceanic 815 survivors and the Others alike {{on opposite sides of the}} island to bend in apparent pain. That night, Charlie is the only person to return from the hatch; the whereabouts of Desmond, Eko, and Locke are not revealed. Charlie reconnects with Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), and they kiss as they sit among their fellow plane survivors.|$|E
5|$|Two {{prominent}} {{forms of}} display among these animals is whistling and bounding. Instead of scent-marking its territory, the reedbuck will give <b>a</b> <b>shrill</b> whistle {{to make the}} boundaries of its territory be known. As it whistles, it expels air through its nose with such a force that the whole of its body vibrates. These whistles, usually one to three in number, are followed by a few stotting bounds. This behaviour {{is also used to}} raise alarm in herds. In this, the reedbuck raises its neck, exposing the white patch on its throat, but keeping the tail down, and leaps in a way similar to the impala's jumps, landing on its forelegs. This is accompanied by the popping of the inguinal glands in the legs. Fights begin with both opponents holding their horns low, in a combat stance; followed by the locking of horns and pushing one another. These fights can even lead to deaths.|$|E
5|$|The {{geographical}} {{range of the}} quagga {{does not appear to}} extend to the northward of the river Vaal. The animal was formerly extremely common within the colony; but, vanishing before the strides of civilisation, is now to be found in very limited numbers and on the borders only. Beyond, on those sultry plains which are completely taken possession of by wild beasts, and may with strict propriety be termed the domains of savage nature, it occurs in interminable herds; and, although never intermixing with its more elegant congeners, it is almost invariably to be found ranging with the white-tailed gnu and with the ostrich, for the society of which bird especially it evinces the most singular predilection. Moving slowly across the profile of the ocean-like horizon, uttering <b>a</b> <b>shrill,</b> barking neigh, of which its name forms a correct imitation, long files of quaggas continually remind the early traveller of a rival caravan on its march. Bands of many hundreds are thus frequently seen doing their migration from the dreary and desolate plains of some portion of the interior, which has formed their secluded abode, seeking for those more luxuriant pastures where, during the summer months, various herbs thrust forth their leaves and flowers to form a green carpet, spangled with hues the most brilliant and diversified.|$|E
60|$|And {{with that}} he put a whistle {{to his lips and}} blew <b>a</b> long <b>shrill</b> blast.|$|R
60|$|One evening, when I was fishing at the inlet, {{the racket}} was {{different}} from any I had heard before. There would be an interval of perfect silence, broken suddenly by wild yelling; then the ordinary loon talk for a few minutes, and another silence, broken by <b>a</b> <b>shriller</b> outcry. That meant that something unusual was going on, so I left the trout, {{to find out about}} it.|$|R
5000|$|The 1988 film Scroogeds {{incarnation}} of the ghost is <b>a</b> violent, <b>shrill</b> fairy played by Carol Kane.|$|R
25|$|The call is <b>a</b> <b>shrill</b> peeping.|$|E
25|$|Dan begins {{rebuilding}} his life. He persuades Geary Manufacturing, {{which now}} owns Hired Girl, {{to take him}} on as a figurehead. He discovers that Miles died in 1972, while Belle has become <b>a</b> <b>shrill</b> and gin-sodden wreck. All she recalls is that Ricky {{went to live with}} her grandmother about the time Dan went into cold sleep. Her scheme with Miles collapsed, as Flexible Frank disappeared the same night she shanghaied Dan.|$|E
25|$|After {{three weeks}} of age, Maguari stork nestlings develop {{defensive}} behaviour if their nest is approached by an intruder; which is not known for nestlings of other stork species. They crouch forward, partially spread their wings and erect the black feathers on their head, neck and back; followed by <b>a</b> <b>shrill,</b> rasping scream and an attempt to grab a persistent intruder with their bill. In many other stork species, akinesia lasts {{throughout much of the}} nestlings’ early life, and the constantly white plumage makes them appear as eggs to potential chick predators. However, in maguari stork nestlings, akinesia ceases much earlier, and the unusual aggressiveness of the young has probably developed as a specialised anti-predator strategy in compensation for the young chicks’ inability to leave the nest due to their slow-developing hallux and the vulnerable position of the nest on the ground. However, at 25–35 days old, the hallux is sufficiently developed to allow the chicks to leave ground nests in search of food. Chicks also occasionally beg for food from their parents outside the nest, but parents have never been observed to feed their young outside the nest.|$|E
60|$|<b>A</b> second <b>shrill</b> whistle, {{prolonged}} angrily, brought one of {{the girls}} {{to the foot of the}} staircase.|$|R
60|$|The {{little man}} smiled a {{suffering}} smile. The twang of his toneless voice sounded <b>a</b> trifle <b>shriller.</b>|$|R
50|$|The call of this {{kingfisher}} is then <b>a</b> short <b>shrill</b> seek. The breeding song is a chuckling li-cha-cha-chui-chui.|$|R
500|$|The Eurasian {{nuthatch}} calls frequently, {{usually with}} a loud, sharp dwip normally repeated twice, sometimes more often if excited. It has <b>a</b> <b>shrill</b> [...] sirrrr or tsi-si-si alarm call, {{and a thin}} tsit pre-flight call. The song is a slow whistled pee-pee-pee with many variants, including a faster version, and may be intermingled with the call.|$|E
500|$|This {{species is}} {{one of a group of}} very similar typical {{treecreeper}} species, all placed in the single genus Certhia. Eight species are currently recognised, in two evolutionary lineages: a [...] Holarctic radiation, and a southern Asian group. The Holarctic group has a more warbling song, always (except in C. familiaris from China) starting or ending with <b>a</b> <b>shrill</b> sreeh. Species in the southern group, in contrast, have a faster-paced trill without the sreeh sound. All the species have distinctive vocalizations and some subspecies have been elevated to species on the basis of their calls.|$|E
500|$|Aggressive males give a trilled {{version of}} their call, {{transcribed}} as [...] "chur-chur-r-r-it-it-it-it". This call {{is also used}} by females in the breeding season, to establish dominance over males while displacing them to feed young or incubate eggs. House sparrows give a nasal alarm call, the basic sound of which is transcribed as quer, and <b>a</b> <b>shrill</b> chree call in great distress. Another vocalisation is the [...] "appeasement call", a soft quee given to inhibit aggression, usually given between birds of a mated pair. These vocalisations are not unique to the house sparrow, but are shared, with small variations, by all sparrows.|$|E
50|$|Dental drills, {{which have}} <b>a</b> distinctive, <b>shrill</b> sound, {{are often a}} {{prominent}} factor in many people's fear of dentistry.|$|R
5000|$|Matilda, the Sheriff's Wife is <b>a</b> plump, <b>shrill</b> woman, {{very fond}} of jewels. She often refers to the Sheriff as John.|$|R
6000|$|She laughed <b>a</b> rather <b>shrill</b> laugh. 'You're <b>a</b> courtier already. Do {{you know}} {{anything}} of dances, wench--or Queen, must I say?' ...|$|R
500|$|... "The Scientist" [...] {{received}} widespread critical acclaim. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone Magazine, in {{his review}} of the album, wrote: [...] "The fantastic piano ballad 'The Scientist'... a cataclysmic falsetto finale that could raise every {{hair on the back}} of your neck." [...] Nick Southall of Stylus magazine wrote: [...] "The piano that chimes through 'The Scientist' is captured perfectly, the warm depression of each individual key caught rather than <b>a</b> <b>shrill</b> ringing as is so often the case." [...] Ian Watson of NME wrote: [...] "'The Scientist' is a song inexorably linked with the endless night sky and the secret hopes and regrets of a hundred thousand strangers." ...|$|E
500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the barn owl does not hoot (such calls {{are made by}} typical owls, like the tawny owl or {{other members of the}} genus Strix). It instead {{produces}} the characteristic shree scream, ear-shattering at close range, an eerie, long-drawn-out shriek. Males in courtship give <b>a</b> <b>shrill</b> twitter. Both young and old can hiss like a snake to scare away intruders. Other sounds produced include a purring chirrup denoting pleasure, and a [...] "kee-yak", which resembles one of the vocalisations of the tawny owl. When captured or cornered, the barn owl throws itself on its back and flails with sharp-taloned feet, making for an effective defence. In such situations it may emit rasping sounds or clicking snaps, produced probably by the beak but possibly by the tongue.|$|E
500|$|The {{commonly}} heard {{female contact}} call is <b>a</b> <b>shrill,</b> kew-wick but the male has a quavering advertising song hoo...ho, ho, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo. William Shakespeare used this owl's song in Love's Labour's Lost (Act 5, Scene 2) as [...] "Then nightly sings the staring owl, Tu-whit; Tu-who, a merry note, While greasy Joan doth keel the pot", but this stereotypical call {{is actually a}} duet, with the female making the kew-wick sound, and the male responding hooo. The call is easily imitated by blowing into cupped hands through slightly parted thumbs, and a study in Cambridgeshire found that this mimicry produced a response from the owl within 30minutes in 94% of trials. A male's response to a broadcast song appears to be indicative of his health and vigour; owls with higher blood parasite loads use fewer high frequencies and a more limited range of frequencies in their responses to an apparent intruder.|$|E
60|$|The Spaniard hesitated, {{then drew}} back and gave <b>a</b> loud, <b>shrill</b> whistle which was, the boys fancied, {{answered}} in the distance.|$|R
60|$|Ambrose blew <b>a</b> loud <b>shrill</b> call, but {{it seemed}} to reach no one but Stephen, whom he {{presently}} saw dashing towards them.|$|R
5000|$|They {{are silent}} mostly at sea. Noises {{can be seen}} on the {{breeding}} colonies, birds on the ground give <b>a</b> drawn-out <b>shrill</b> whistle.|$|R
