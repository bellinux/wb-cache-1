5|$|On {{the evening}} of 1October Valckenier {{received}} reports that a crowd of a thousand Chinese had gathered outside the gate, angered by his statements <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> meeting five days earlier. This report was received incredulously by Valckenier and the council. However, after {{the murder of a}} Balinese sergeant by the Chinese outside the walls, the council decided to take extraordinary measures and reinforce the guard. Two groups of 50 Europeans and some native porters were sent to outposts on the south and east sides of the city, and a plan of attack was formulated.|$|E
5|$|The local nurses' {{union for}} the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital is on strike. Jeff, {{the husband of}} Deb (Chad Morgan), one of the nurses, collapses while walking the picket line. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> room, House {{suspects}} Jeff's extreme niceness and inability to get angry is a major symptom of an underlying condition. After various tests, the team suspects his niceness is a personality change resulting from syphilis. Kutner (Kal Penn) asks the couple if either of them had an affair, {{which could lead to}} syphilis. Deb denies it, stating that it is just the way her husband behaves and that it is impossible for her to not love him.|$|E
5|$|The Hiroshima {{mission was}} {{followed}} by another atomic strike. Originally scheduled for 11 August, it was brought forward by two days to 9 August owing to a forecast of bad weather. This time, a Fat Man nuclear weapon was carried by B-29 Bockscar, piloted by Major Charles W. Sweeney. Enola Gay, flown by Captain George Marquardt's Crew B-10, was the weather reconnaissance aircraft for Kokura, the primary target. Enola Gay reported clear skies over Kokura, {{but by the time}} Bockscar arrived, the city was obscured by smoke from fires from the conventional bombing of Yahata by 224 B-29s the day before. After three unsuccessful passes, Bockscar diverted to its secondary target, Nagasaki, where it dropped its bomb. In contrast to the Hiroshima mission, the Nagasaki mission has been described as tactically botched, although the mission did meet its objectives. The crew encountered a number of problems in execution, and had very little fuel by the time they landed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> backup landing site Yontan Airfield on Okinawa.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of the toxic effects information came from a study conducted between 1 April 2005 to 1 September 2005. The study recorded all presentations associated with party pill use <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Emergency</b> Department of Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand by recording them on a prospective data collection form. The aim was to study the patterns of human toxicity related {{to the use of}} benzylpiperazine-based 'party pills'. 61 patients presented on 80 occasions. Patients with mild to moderate toxicity experienced symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, dystonia and urinary retention. Significantly, fourteen toxic seizures were recorded with two patients suffering life-threatening toxicity with status epilepticus and severe respiratory and metabolic acidosis. It was concluded that BZP appears to induce toxic seizures in neurologically normal subjects. The results of this study and others like it showed that BZP can cause unpredictable and serious toxicity in some individuals, but the data and dosage collection were reliant on self reporting by drug users, which may result in under-reporting (or over-reporting), and there were complicating factors like the frequent presence of alcohol and other drugs.|$|E
25|$|Swango did {{not often}} vary his methods of murder. With non-patients, {{such as his}} {{coworkers}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> medical service, he used poisons, usually arsenic, slipping them into foods and beverages. With patients, he sometimes used poisons as well, but usually he administered an overdose of whichever drug the patient had been prescribed, or wrote unnecessary prescriptions for dangerous drugs.|$|E

Anyone can easily access the application from anyone’s mobile. Hence even a stranger can become a helping hand <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of <b>emergency.</b> <b>The</b> location of the users can’t be updated all the time. Hence the location of the requestor is also found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of <b>emergency.</b> <b>The</b> users willing to donate blood can acknowledge the request. Misusing the numbers of any user of the application is totally avoided since even the user who is requesting for blood cannot view others details.

Rogaland County Municipality, then the operator of Rogaland Central Hospital, had no objections {{to the establishment of}} the base, but were not willing to provide funding. Many physicians at the hospital opposed the establishment. Their main concern was that it would drain human resources which could be better used <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> department. To fund the establishment, NLA largely approached private companies and asked for charitable donations.|$|E
25|$|Drowning {{is a major}} {{worldwide}} {{cause of}} death and injury in children. Long term neurological outcomes of drowning cannot be predicted accurately {{during the early stages}} of treatment and although survival after long submersion times, mostly by young children, has been reported, many survivors will remain severely and permanently neurologically compromised after much shorter submersion times. Factors affecting probability of long term recovery with mild deficits or full function in young children include the duration of submersion, whether advanced life support was needed at the accident site, the duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and whether spontaneous breathing and circulation are present on arrival <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> room.|$|E
25|$|Christchurch Police were {{supplemented}} by {{staff and resources}} from around the country, along with a 323-strong contingent of Australian Police, who were sworn in as New Zealand Police on their arrival, bringing {{the total number of}} officers in the city to 1200. Many of them received standing ovations from appreciative locals as they walked through Christchurch Airport upon arrival. Alongside regular duties, the police provided security cordons, organised evacuations, supported search and rescue teams, missing persons and family liaison, and organised media briefings and tours of the affected areas. They also provided forensic analysis and evidence gathering at fatalities and Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) teams, working closely with pathologists, forensic dentists and scientists, and the coroner <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> mortuary established at Burnham Military Camp. They were aided by DVI teams from Australia, UK, Thailand Taiwan and Israel.|$|E

25|$|Herbert and {{the author}} Thomas Nelson Page (a friend of Ezekiel's) visited with the {{sculptor}} in Washington, D.C., on November 5, 1910. Ezekiel expressed his intense desire to obtain the commission. Herbert, Page, and Ezekiel then visited the Confederate section at Arlington National Cemetery and discussed the size and placement of the memorial. Ezekiel sketched out his idea {{on a piece of}} paper for the two men. He also made it clear that he would work in Italy, and would not accept any design input from the ACMA. The following day, the design committee held an emergency meeting. Dr. McKim could not attend, but advised the committee that he approved of Ezekiel's selection. Mrs. Keith also could not attend, but offered no proxy. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> meeting, Ezekiel outlined his proposal for the memorial: a heroic female figure symbolic of the South with a wreath in one hand and the other resting on a plow, standing atop a circular base around which figures representing the sacrifices of the South were grouped.|$|E
500|$|Moumen {{was picked}} up at around 8:30 from Pearl Roundabout. He had serious {{injuries}} to his pelvis and right thigh. Bleeding profusely, two paramedics found Moumen after police allowed them through. The paramedics reported that they saw another possibly dead body with a fractured skull close to Moumen's, but were not permitted to pick it up. While leaving, the ambulance was reportedly attacked by riot police who beat the driver before allowing them to continue to the SMC. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> room, Moumen had a surgery, but he died at 9:30. His father called Prime Minister Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa a [...] "killer" [...] and blamed him for his son's death. An unnamed policeman who charged {{with the murder of}} Moumen was acquitted on 27 September 2012.|$|E
500|$|Although Parr had {{requested}} a stretcher, none were ready at the hospital, {{and it did}} not normally keep a stretcher <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> room's entrance. Reagan exited the limousine and insisted on walking. Reagan acted casual and smiled at onlookers as he walked in. While he entered the hospital unassisted, once inside the president complained of difficulty breathing, his knees buckled, and he went down on one knee; Parr and others assisted him into the emergency room. The Physician to the President, Daniel Ruge, arrived with Reagan; believing that the president might have had a heart attack, he insisted that the hospital's trauma team, and not he himself or specialists from elsewhere, operate on him as it would treat any other patient. When a hospital employee asked Reagan aide Michael Deaver for the patient's name and address, only when Deaver stated [...] "1600 Pennsylvania" [...] did the worker realize that the President of the United States was in the emergency room.|$|E

500|$|De Mena {{joined the}} UNIA in Chicago and in 1924 was sent as a {{delegate}} to the annual convention in Harlem. At the convention, she asked the leadership to recognize the Daughters of Ethiopia, an honorary group making contributions to racial improvement, as an official auxiliary of the UNIA. By gaining the organization's approval, women members of the UNIA gained recognition of their contributions. In 1925, Henrietta Vinton Davis organized {{a tour of the}} Caribbean and was accompanied by de Mena, who was to serve as both translator and organizer on the trip. De Mena proved successful in both fund raising and recruiting new members, and her language skills with Spanish were rewarded with a higher salary than Davis'. By the time the women returned, now enjoying a reputation as a motivational speaker, de Mena was asked to join Garvey on stage on July 5, 1925, to call for unity. Garvey lost his appeal on his fraud case that same year and was remanded to the Atlanta Penitentiary. Throughout the summer and fall of that year, de Mena accompanied Amy Jacques-Garvey on a speaking tour covering many major cities in the Midwest, along the Atantic coast and to New Orleans. The tour solidified her place in Garvey's inner circle. [...] <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> convention of 1926, de Mena was elected as assistant international organizer and the following year succeeded Davis as the fourth vice president general, becoming Garvey's official representative. She kept in close contact with him both through correspondence and visits despite her travel schedule. Upon Garvey's release from prison in 1927 and his deportation to Jamaica, de Mena led a celebratory UNIA parade through Kingston. Perched on a horse and brandishing a sword, she was a visible symbol of the crusading woman.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{stations}} {{are within the}} tunnel: Tappi-Kaitei Station and Yoshioka-Kaitei Station. They serve as emergency escape points.

The effectiveness of the escape shafts <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> stations is enhanced by having exhaust fans to extract smoke, television cameras to help route passengers to safety, thermal (infrared) fire alarm systems, and water spray nozzles. Before the construction of the Hokkaido Shinkansen, both stations contained museums detailing the history and function of the tunnel that could be visited on special sightseeing tours. The museums are now closed and the space provides storage for work on the Hokkaido Shinkansen. [...] The two were the first railway stations in the world built under the sea.|$|E
