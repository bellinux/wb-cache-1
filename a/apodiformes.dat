5000|$|Strisores ( [...] ) is a clade of birds. It {{includes}} the living families and orders Caprimulgidae (nightjars, nighthawks and allies), Nyctibiidae (potoos), <b>Apodiformes</b> (swifts and hummingbirds), {{as well as}} the Aegotheliformes (owlet-nightjars) whose distinctness was only recently realized. The <b>Apodiformes</b> (which include the [...] "Trochiliformes" [...] of the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy) and the Aegotheliformes form the Daedalornithes.|$|E
50|$|The {{relationship}} between the owlet-nightjars and the (traditional) Caprimulgiformes has long been controversial and obscure and remains so today: in the 19th century they were regarded as a subfamily of the frogmouths, {{and they are still}} generally considered {{to be related to the}} frogmouths and/or the nightjars. It appears though that they are not so closely related to either as previously thought, and that the owlet-nightjars share a more recent common ancestor with the <b>Apodiformes.</b> As has been suggested on occasion since morphological studies of the cranium in the 1960s, they are thus considered a distinct order, Aegotheliformes. This, the caprimulgiform lineage(s), and the <b>Apodiformes,</b> are postulated to form a clade called Cypselomorphae, with the owlet-nightjars and the <b>Apodiformes</b> forming the clade Daedalornithes.|$|E
50|$|The hummingbird is {{a member}} of the class Aves, the order <b>Apodiformes,</b> the family Trochilidae and the genus Leucippus.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Description and Paleobiology== Eurotrochilus {{specimens}} {{are some}} of the smallest fossil birds and are in the <b>Apodiforme</b> order of Aves due to their strongly abbreviated humeri and ulnae. They are most similar to another <b>Apodiforme,</b> an early Oligocene member of the stem-group Trochilidae, Jungornis. Both Eurotrochilus and Jungornis have morphological adaptations for sustained hovering flight, a characteristic of extant hummingbirds, including the Apodifmore synapomorphy (abbreviated ulna and humerus) as well as pronounced distal protrusions on the humeral heads. These adaptions in Eurotrochilus are more pronounced though. Another difference is that Eurotrochilus have elongated beaks (unknown in Jungornis), which is evidence of nectarivory, the ability to consume nectar from flowers. Eurotrochilus are {{believed to be the first}} members of stem group Trochilidae to be able to perform nectarivory.|$|R
40|$|New {{colonies of}} Pallid Slrift (Apus pallidus) at the Mittorca's Island. Through a census made on May of 1992 there were {{discovered}} six new colonies of Pallid Swift (Apus palliclus) at the Minorca's island (Balearics), with an estimation of: Rafalet 30 individuals, Alcaufar 20 ind., Illa de l'Aire 30 ind., Binidali-Cova Degollador 25 ind., Son Saura-Cala Vell 5 ind. and Artrutx 60 ind. With this data {{it is confirmed}} that it is the most common <b>Apodiforme</b> in the Minorcan coast...|$|R
5000|$|According to its discoverers, E. rowei is a basal form of {{the order}} <b>Apodiformes,</b> which {{traditionally}} includes hummingbirds, tree swifts, and swifts. [...] However, not all researchers agree that Eocypselus properly belongs to <b>Apodiformes.</b> Further studies are necessary to definitely establish E. roweis place in evolutionary history. [...] If Ksepka et al.s classification is correct, then E. rowei would represent good evidence that hummingbird and swift ancestors first evolved their small size, then evolved divergent flying abilities.|$|E
50|$|The {{placement}} of the Aegialornithidae is not quite clear. Various analyses place them sufficiently close to the <b>Apodiformes</b> to be included here, or into the unique owlet-nightjar lineage in the Cypselomorphae.|$|E
5000|$|The lesser violetear {{belongs to}} the order <b>Apodiformes.</b> Hummingbirds share this order with the swifts, such as the white-collared swift. The name <b>Apodiformes</b> {{is derived from the}} Greek words [...] "a pous," [...] meaning [...] "without foot." [...] While apodiforms do in fact have feet, they are quite small and their legs are short and {{relatively}} weak. Many birds in this order cannot walk, and thus rarely if ever land on the ground since quick escape from predators is virtually impossible. For this reason members of this order spend a majority of their time in the air.|$|E
5000|$|The {{collared}} inca is (controversially) {{placed in}} the order <b>Apodiformes,</b> which contains swifts as well as hummingbirds. It is in the family Trochilidae, that of the hummingbirds, and placed within the subfamily Trochilinae, the so-called [...] "typical hummingbirds." ...|$|E
50|$|The bird is superficially {{similar to}} a large barn swallow or house martin. It is, however, {{completely}} unrelated to those passerine species, since swifts are in the order <b>Apodiformes.</b> The resemblances between the groups are due to convergent evolution, reflecting similar life styles.|$|E
50|$|The hummingbirds, swifts, and crested swifts share other {{anatomical}} similarities {{with one}} another, {{as well as}} similarities (notably as to the skull) with their probable closest living relatives, the owlet-nightjars. The owlet-nightjars are apparently convergent with the closely related Caprimulgiformes, which form a clade Cypselomorphae with the <b>Apodiformes.</b>|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, Mayr's phylogenetic taxon Cypselomorphae {{might be}} placed at order rank and {{substitute}} the two present orders Caprimulgiformes and <b>Apodiformes.</b> Such a {{group would be}} fairly uninformative as regards its evolutionary history, as it has to include some very plesiomorphic and some extremely derived lineages (such as hummingbirds) to achieve monophyly.|$|E
50|$|The swifts are a family, Apodidae, {{of highly}} aerial birds. They are superficially similar to swallows, {{but are not}} closely related {{to any of the}} {{passerine}} species. Swifts are placed in the order <b>Apodiformes,</b> which they share with hummingbirds. The treeswifts are closely related to the true swifts, but form a separate family, the Hemiprocnidae.|$|E
50|$|The blue swallow (Hirundo atrocaerulea) {{is a small}} bird {{within the}} swallow family {{which is in the}} order Passeriformes. Swallows are {{somewhat}} similar in habits and appearance to other aerial insectivores, such as the martins (also a passerine) and the swifts (order <b>Apodiformes).</b> It breeds in the Afromontane (from South Africa to Tanzania), wintering north of Lake Victoria.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, {{the bird}} order <b>Apodiformes</b> {{contained}} three living families: the swifts (Apodidae), the treeswifts (Hemiprocnidae), and the hummingbirds (Trochilidae). In the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy, this order is raised to a superorder Apodimorphae in which hummingbirds are separated {{as a new}} order, Trochiliformes. With nearly 450 species identified to date, {{they are the most}} diverse order of birds after the passerines.|$|E
50|$|The {{little swift}} (Apus affinis), {{is a small}} bird, superficially similar to a barn swallow or house martin. It is, however, {{completely}} unrelated to those passerine species, since swifts are in the order <b>Apodiformes.</b> The resemblances between the groups are due to convergent evolution reflecting similar life styles. The former eastern race, house swift, is usually considered a separate species, Apus nipalensis.|$|E
50|$|The {{common swift}} (Apus apus) is a {{medium-sized}} bird, superficially {{similar to the}} barn swallow or house martin but somewhat larger, though not stemming from those passerine species, being in the order <b>Apodiformes.</b> The resemblances between the groups are due to convergent evolution, reflecting similar contextual development. The swifts' nearest relatives {{are thought to be}} the New World hummingbirds and the Southeast Asian treeswifts.|$|E
50|$|Sevan {{lake and}} its {{vicinity}} {{are rich in}} avifauna. Up to 267 bird species have been recorded in Sevan Basin. The known avifauna can be grouped into the orderss: Podicipediformes, Pelecaniformes, Phoenicopteriformes, Falconiformes, Anseriformes, Galliformes, Gruiformes, Charadriiformes, Columbiformes, Cuculiformes, Strigiformes, Caprimulgiformes, <b>Apodiformes,</b> Coraciiformes, Piciformes, and Passeriformes. 39 species {{are included in the}} Red Book of Armenia. There is also an endemic species Armenian gull (Larus armenicus).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Apodiformes</b> diversified {{during the}} Eocene, {{at the end}} of which the extant {{families}} were present; fossil genera are known from all over temperate Europe, between today's Denmark and France, such as the primitive swift-like Scaniacypselus (Early - Middle Eocene) and the more modern Procypseloides (Late Eocene/Early Oligocene - Early Miocene). A prehistoric genus sometimes assigned to the swifts, Primapus (Early Eocene of England), might also be a more distant ancestor.|$|E
50|$|In {{traditional}} taxonomy, hummingbirds {{are placed}} in the order <b>Apodiformes,</b> which also contains the swifts. However, some taxonomists have separated them into their own order, the Trochiliformes. Hummingbirds' wing bones are hollow and fragile, making fossilization difficult and leaving their evolutionary history poorly documented. Though scientists theorize that hummingbirds originated in South America, where species diversity is greatest, possible ancestors of extant hummingbirds may have lived in parts of Europe to what is southern Russia today.|$|E
50|$|These <b>apodiformes</b> {{build their}} nests in colonies in a {{suitable}} cliff hole or cave, laying {{two or three}} eggs. Swifts {{will return to the}} same sites year after year, rebuilding their nests when necessary, and pairing for life. Young swifts in the nest can drop their body temperature and become torpid if bad weather prevents their parents from catching insects nearby. They have adapted well to urban conditions, frequently nesting in old buildings in towns around the Mediterranean, where large, low-flying flocks are a familiar feature in summer.|$|E
50|$|The humeri of Eurotrochilus {{have been}} {{measured}} {{to be between}} 6.0 and 6.5 millimeters. It is considered short and stout {{when compared to other}} <b>Apodiformes,</b> except extant hummingbirds. In addition, the humeri have a wide proximal articular part and there are pronounced distal protrusions on the caput humeri, which is a synapomoprhy of Jungornis, Eurotrochilus, and crown group Trochilidae. The humeri protrusions in Eurotrochilus are significantly more marked than in Jungornis and are more similar to Trochilidae. These morphological specializations of the humeri allow the bone to rotate during hovering flight.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Apodiformes</b> {{evolved in}} the Northern Hemisphere. Eocypselus, a {{primitive}} genus known from the Late Paleocene or Early Eocene of north-central Europe, is somewhat difficult to assign; it is considered a primitive hemiprocnid. [...] This {{would suggest that the}} major apodiform lineages diverged shortly after the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. However, the perching adaptation of the foot of Eocypselus on which this theory rests may just as well be a symplesiomorphy.Most researchers believe that presently this genus cannot be unequivocally assigned to either the <b>Apodiformes</b> or the Caprimulgiformes. The Early Eocene Primapus, found in England, is similar to both a primitive swift and the aegialornithids, which are in some aspects intermediate between swifts and owlet-nightjars. Fossil evidence demonstrates the existence of swifts during that period in Europe. At that time, most of Europe had a humid, subtropical climate, possibly comparable to modern-day southern China. For a map of Early-Middle Eocene Earth, see the Paleomap project; here note that both the Caucasus mountains and the Alps did not exist yet and aegialornithids were possibly present in North America.By the late Eocene (around 35 MYA), primitive hummingbirds started to diverge from the related jungornithids; the Middle Eocene Parargornis (Messel, Germany) and the Late Eocene Argornis, found in today's southernmost Russia, belong to this lineage. Cypselavus (Late Eocene - Early Oligocene of Quercy, France) was either a primitive hemiprocnid or an aegialornithid.|$|E
50|$|The {{red-rumped swallow}} (Cecropis daurica) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird in the swallow family. It breeds in open hilly country of temperate southern Europe and Asia from Portugal and Spain to Japan, India, Sri Lanka and tropical Africa. The Indian and African birds are resident, but European and other Asian birds are migratory. They winter in Africa or India and are vagrants to Christmas Island and northern Australia.Red-rumped swallows are somewhat similar in habits and appearance to the other aerial insectivores, such as the related swallows and the unrelated swifts (order <b>Apodiformes).</b> They have blue upperparts and dusky underparts.|$|E
50|$|The sapphire-throated hummingbird {{is part of}} {{the order}} <b>Apodiformes,</b> which {{includes}} the hummingbirds, swifts and treeswifts. They are part of the family Trochilidae, also known as the hummingbirds, which are distinguished by their small size, high metabolism and extremely rapid wing-flapping. The sapphire-throated hummingbirds are grouped into the genus Lepidopyga, which includes only two other species; the sapphire-bellied hummingbird and the shining-green hummingbird. Although part of the same genus, the sapphire-throated hummingbird is taxonomically-closer related to the blue-headed sapphire (Hylocharis grayi) than the shining-green hummingbird. Additionally, the sapphire-throated hummingbird acts as an outgroup for some members of the genus Amazilia, such as the white-chested emerald (Amazilia brevirostris) and the plain-bellied emerald (Amazilia leucogaster).|$|E
5000|$|You et al. (2006) {{concluded}} that the anatomical characteristics of Gansus were similar to foot-propelled diving birds, such as Hesperornis (from the Cretaceous) and the loons (Gaviidae) and grebes (Podicipedidae). [...] On the other hand, Li et al. (2011) {{concluded that}} Gansus showed a more similar morphology to ducks. Two years later, Nudds et al. (2013) showed that the pectoral limb length proportions of Gansus were most similar to swifts and hummingbirds (<b>Apodiformes),</b> while the pelvic limb length proportions fell within the modern birds (Neornithes), showing similarities with grebes (Podicipedidae), albatross (Diomedeidae) and cormorants (Phalacrocoracidae), suggesting that Gansus was both volant and capable of diving to some degree using either foot-propelled or, perhaps, both its wings and its feet for underwater locomotion.|$|E
5000|$|It seems {{probable}} that the taxa {{included in the}} Metaves by Fain and Houde contain some good clades, such as Caprimulgiformes, the Mirandornithes, or the <b>Apodiformes.</b> Considering that some [...] "odd Gruiformes" [...] which might be each other's closest living relatives make {{up most of the}} remaining Metaves, the doves, the hoatzin, and sandgrouse would remain as [...] "Metaves incerta sedis" [...] (Metaves with uncertain placement). This would seem to suggest that the hoatzin is at least more closely related to doves than to many of the other purported 'coronavian' families that previously have been suggested. Subsequent multigene studies of Ericson et al. 2006 and of Hackett et al. 2008 corroborated the Metaves clades, dependent on the inclusion of one and two genes respectively, but the latter did not recover the hoatzin with Metaves.|$|E
50|$|On the {{territory}} of the Prioksko-Terrasny state nature biosphere reserve, covering 4945 ha, 134 species of birds from 14 orders (Ciconiiformes, Anseriformes, Falconiformes, Galliformes, Gruiformes, Charadriiformes, Columbiformes, Cuculiformes, Strigiformes, Caprimulgiformes, <b>Apodiformes,</b> Coraciiformes, Piciformes, Passeriformes) had been registered by 1991. Later 5 more species were observed here. Thus, by the present time, the list of species of birds registered in the Reserve numbers 139 species. About 55% from them are Passerines. Most of birds of the Reserve belong to migratory breeding species or to nomadic breeding species. Some species are vagrants in the Reserve and in the Moscow Region (nutcracker Nicifraga caryocatactes (L.), etc.). Birds, nesting in central parts of Russia and on {{the territory}} of the Prioksko-Terrasny Reserve, in autumn are migrating to south-west. Part of them are wintering in southern regions of Russia and near the Black Sea, others are flying to south-western part of Europe: the Balkans, the Apennines, South France, South Germany. The rest migrate across the Mediterranean Sea and fly to Northern Africa.|$|E
5000|$|When {{seen as a}} gruiform, the kagu is {{generally}} considered related to the extinct adzebills from New Zealand and the sunbittern from Central and South America. Recent studies do indicate that the sunbittern is the closest living relative of the kagu. For example, Fain & Houde found these to be certainly sister taxa. They and the mesites did not group with traditional Gruiformes in their study, but instead with their proposed clade Metaves, which also includes the hoatzin, pigeons, Caprimulgiformes, flamingos, tropicbirds, <b>Apodiformes,</b> sandgrouse and grebes. The internal structure of this group was not well resolvable by their data, although later studies confirmed a close relationship between the kagu and sunbittern.

40|$|Three {{new species}} of {{parasitic}} mites of the genus Neharpyrhynchus Fain (Acariformes, Harpirhynchidae) are described from Neotropical birds, N. chlorospingus sp. n. from Chlorospingus pileatus (Passeriformes, Emberizidae) from Costa Rica, N. mironovi sp. n. from Dacnys cayana (Passeriformes, Thraupidae) and N. tangara sp. n. from Tangara cayana (Thraupidae) both from Brazil. Neharpyrhynchus trochilinus (Fain) is recorded from 3 new hosts of the family Trochilidae (<b>Apodiformes),</b> Panterpe insignis and Eugenes fulgens from Costa Rica, and Amazilia lactea from Brazil.

40|$|A new {{collection}} of over three hundred bird bones from the Upper Miocene of Gargano is described. Eight different orders are represented: Anseriformes (1 species), Falconiformes (2), Galliformes (1), Strigiformes (6), Columbiformes (1), <b>Apodiformes</b> (1), Piciformes (1) and Passeriformes. Two {{of the three}} new species are assigned to extant genera: Columba omnisanctorum and Apus wetmorei, while a new strigid owl {{of the size of}} Nyctea scandiaca is believed to represent a new endemic genus. It is provisionally called Strix ? perpasta. The increase in size of the Accipitridae and the Strigiformes allows to distinguish five different biozones and thus to arrange a number of localities into a stratigraphical sequence...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} length {{proportions of}} the three bony elements of the pelvic (femur, tibiotarsus and tarsometatarsus) and pectoral (humerus, ulna and manus) limbs of the early Cretaceous bird Gansus yumenensis, a well-represented basal ornithuromorph from China, are investigated and compared to those of extant taxa. Ternary plots show that the pectoral limb length proportions of Gansus are most similar to <b>Apodiformes</b> (swifts and humming-birds), which plot away from all other extant birds. In contrast, the pelvic limb length proportions of Gansus fall within the extant bird cluster and show similarities with the neornithine families Podicipedidae (grebes), Diomedeidae (albatross) and Phalacrocoracidae (cormorants). Although it does {{have some of the}} pelvic limb features of grebes and cormorants, the femur of Gansus is more gracile and is thus more consistent with an albatross-like shallow-diving mode of life than a strong foot-propelled diving movement pattern. The position of Gansus in pectoral limb ternary morpho-space is largely due to its elongated manus. In contrast to <b>apodiformes,</b> where the humerus and ulna are short and robust, an adaptation, which provides a stiff wing for their demanding fast agile and hovering flight(respectively), the wing-bones of Gansus are slender, indicating a less vigorous flapping flight style. The suite of characters exhibited by Gansus mean it is difficult to completely interpret its likely ecology. Nevertheless, our analyses suggest that it is probable that this bird was both volant and capable of diving to some degree using either foot-propelled or, perhaps, both its wings and its feet for underwater locomotion...|$|E
