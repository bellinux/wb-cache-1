40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{reported}} that the training for practitioners does not stimulate reflexes {{that contribute to the}} tenets of teamwork and collaboration. No studies were found to investigate relational intelligence (RQ) in pharmacist-physician relationships as a catalyst for collaborative and hence cost effective quality care. This study addressed the role and potential opportunity to promote RQ as a critical leadership skill in the collaboration between pharmacists <b>and</b> <b>physicians.</b> Using RQ as the conceptual framework, this phenomenological study explored how pharmacists <b>and</b> <b>physicians</b> in a hospital setting perceive RQ as a leadership skill when working collaboratively. A total of 10 participants (5 pharmacists <b>and</b> 5 <b>physicians)</b> from a 443 -bed comprehensive hospital in Michigan were selected using purposive sampling. Pharmacists <b>and</b> <b>physicians</b> included had at least 4 years of hospital experience. Data were collected through semistructured in-depth interviews and analyzed using the hierarchical approach. Results indicated interest among both pharmacists <b>and</b> <b>physicians</b> to use RQ as a leadership skill to work collaboratively. Further findings highlighted the need for face-to-face communication between pharmacists <b>and</b> <b>physicians,</b> better collaboration, accountability, feedback, focus and alignment, promotion of positive relationships, and a leadership position directed by a PhD-prepared practitioner with expertise in RQ. These findings bring awareness to both pharmacists <b>and</b> <b>physicians</b> of barriers to collaboration; these findings also suggest the need for multidisciplinary training that incorporates RQ theory as a foundation for both pharmacists <b>and</b> <b>physicians,</b> which may decrease health care costs while improving communication, trust, mutual understanding, collaboration, and quality care...|$|R

5|$|CDTM is an {{expansion}} of the traditional pharmacist scope of practice, allowing for pharmacist-lead management of drug related problems (DRPs) with an emphasis on a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to pharmacy practice in the healthcare setting. The terms of a CPA are decided by the collaborating pharmacist <b>and</b> <b>physician,</b> though templates exist online. CPAs can be specific to a patient population of interest to the two parties, a specific clinical situation or disease state, and/or may outline an evidence-based protocol for managing the drug regimen of patients under the CPA. CPAs have become the subject of intense debate within the pharmacy and medical professions.|$|E
