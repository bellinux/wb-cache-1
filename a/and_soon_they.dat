5|$|Those {{men of the}} 1st Parachute Brigade {{that landed}} on the {{southern}} drop zone were well within range of the 1st Fallschirmjäger Machine Gun Battalion. In the darkness, the Germans initially thought that the paratroopers were their own reinforcements landing, but they soon realised their mistake and opened fire. Some of those who escaped the machine gun fire were rounded up on the drop zone, and about 100of them became prisoners of war {{as soon as they}} had touched ground. In the confusion of the landing, 50 men of the 1st Parachute Battalion had assembled, assaulted and managed to capture the bridge before the 50 Italian defenders could destroy it with the attached demolition charges. The Italians were taken prisoner, just as a second group of 40 paratroopers led by Brigadier Lathbury arrived at the bridge. Lathbury organised the safe removal of the demolition charges and set up a defensive perimeter. More paratroopers continued to gather at the bridge, <b>and</b> <b>soon</b> <b>they</b> numbered around 120men, who dug in to the north and south.|$|E
5|$|In 1649, {{the town}} is witness to many witch burnings. In the church, the townspeople {{try to figure out}} whom to condemn next. People begin accusing others <b>and</b> <b>soon</b> <b>they</b> erupt into chaos, until Marge intervenes. She tries to talk sense into the townspeople, but Moe accuses her of being a witch. Quimby assures her that she is {{entitled}} to due process which means she will be thrown off a cliff with a broomstick; if she is a witch she will be able to fly to safety, in which case the authorities expect her to report back for punishment. If she is not a witch, then she will fall to an honorable Christian death. After being shoved off the cliff, Marge flies up on the broomstick revealing that she really is a witch and vows to conquer the whole entire town. She returns to her sisters Patty and Selma. The sisters watch Ned and Maude Flanders talking about how the witches eat children, which gives them the notion to do just that. They knock on the Flanders' door and demand their sons, but before they leave, Maude offers the witches gingerbread men instead. The witches like these better than the children so they go to each house, getting goodies in exchange for not eating the children. As they fly off, the Sea Captain says that is how the tradition of Halloween and trick-or-treating started.|$|E

25|$|With the {{subdivision}} of the Amato territory, many residents became minor landowners. However many {{were unable to}} survive from these little farms <b>and</b> <b>soon</b> <b>they</b> sold their possessions to other landowners thus contributing to the consolidation of large territories under the ownership of few families, a fact that remains to this day. While recent divisions among heirs has divided the large holdings, the lands remain, nonetheless, within the same families noted above.|$|E

They tried to avoid each other while sharing the same woman for almost two decades.|$|E
25|$|The {{continuing}} {{inability of}} the Abbasid central government to suppress the revolt, caused in part by its preoccupation with fighting against the Saffarid Ya'qub ibn al-Layth's advance into Iraq, eventually encouraged the Zanj to expand their activities to the north. A campaign by the rebels to occupy the marshlands between Basra and Wasit in 876 proved successful, <b>and</b> <b>soon</b> <b>they</b> {{made their way into}} the district of Kaskar. By 879, the rebellion reached its furthest extent; Wasit was sacked and the rebels advanced northwest along the Tigris, coming to within fifty miles of Baghdad.|$|E

25|$|After another brief pause, Chamberlain {{saw that}} his New York {{regiment}} was being driven back from an attempt to take the Confederate works in the woods ahead. Chamberlain and the regiment's officers steadied the men <b>and</b> <b>soon</b> <b>they</b> pushed the Confederates back until Union artillery under Regular Army Lieutenant John Mitchell came up with four guns to support them. Despite the artillery fire, the Confederates tried to outflank and charge the Union position. Chamberlain's men and the artillery held the position, but then the Confederates charged the Pennsylvania troops {{in the center and}} on the right of the Union position. These Union soldiers were nearly out of ammunition and began to slowly retreat.|$|E
25|$|The Chickens {{were used}} on {{a limited number of}} routes, from 4 July 1954 on lines 0, 8 and 13, {{variously}} serving the Vippetangen Line, the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line, the Sagene Line and the Sinsen Line. From 1955 they also started running on the Rodeløkka Line. The TO trailers were usually run with the Chickens, although they were also hauled by the larger Høka units. The tramway experienced that the Chickens did not have sufficient pneumatic capacity to keep a tram and trailer at ease while stopped on slopes, as separate compressors in the trailers were not installed. This made operating trailers with the Chickens a safety hazard <b>and</b> <b>soon</b> <b>they</b> were only seen i solitude.|$|E
25|$|Castro made {{threats to}} {{overthrow}} Trujillo, and Trujillo responded {{by increasing the}} budget for national defense. A foreign legion formed to defend Haiti, as many expected that Castro might invade the Haitian {{part of the island}} first and remove François Duvalier as well. On June 14, 1959, a Cuban plane with 56 fighting men landed near Constanza, Dominican Republic, only to be immediately wiped out. Six days later, 140 more invaders in 2 yachts were intercepted by the Dominican navy and sunk. Trujillo ordered his son, Ramfis, to lead the hunt for the invaders, <b>and</b> <b>soon</b> <b>they</b> were captured. The leaders of the invasion were taken aboard a Dominican Air Force plane and then pushed out in mid-air, falling to their deaths.|$|E

25|$|Scott {{had used}} dogs {{on his first}} (Discovery) {{expedition}} and felt they had failed. On that journey, Scott, Shackleton, and Wilson started with three sledges and 13 dogs. But on that expedition, the men had not properly understood how to travel on snow {{with the use of}} dogs. The party had skis but were too inexperienced to make good use of them. As a result, the dogs travelled so fast that the men could not keep up with them. The Discovery expedition had to increase their loads to slow the dogs down. Additionally, the dogs were fed Norwegian dried fish, which did not agree with them <b>and</b> <b>soon</b> <b>they</b> began to deteriorate. The whole team of dogs eventually died (and were eaten), and the men took over hauling the sleds.|$|E
25|$|After the {{suppression}} of al-Mu'tazz's supporters, the caliph's reign continued largely unabated until 865. The continual inability {{of the government to}} pay the soldiers, however, combined with infighting among the ranks of the Turks, threatened the stability of the regime. At the beginning of 865, a quarrel among the Turkish officers broke out, and the general soldiery quickly became involved. When one of the officers was killed, the soldiers turned violent, <b>and</b> <b>soon</b> <b>they</b> were rioting throughout the streets of Samarra. Faced with this hostile situation, al-Musta'in and two of the senior Turkish officers, Wasif and Bugha al-Sharabi, decided to leave Samarra for Baghdad, where they were arrived {{in the first week of}} February 865. Upon their arrival, they were greeted by the city's powerful Tahirid governor, Muhammad b. 'Abdallah, in whose palace the caliph took up his residence.|$|E
25|$|At Calcutta, {{the pair}} changed their disguises, now {{pretending to be}} Swiss businessmen, and {{continued}} on by train and river steamer to Chittagong, from where they took a sampan to Cox's Bazar. They continued on foot through the jungle, fighting hunger and the approaching monsoon. After {{more than a month}} on the run they crossed the Naf River into Burma, where they were captured and imprisoned by Japanese troops who were convinced they were spies. Following two months on starvation rations, they were transferred to a jail at Rangoon, where they were appalled by the conditions inflicted on Allied prisoners. In September 1944, four months after their initial escape, news of their presence in Burma was released to the Press, <b>and</b> <b>soon</b> <b>they</b> were flown to Japan, where they waited out the war, working as honorary consuls at the German Embassy in Tokyo.|$|E

The opposing forces clashed in Sabuthilag (alternately called Sufetula), which became {{the name of this}} battle. Records from al-Bidayah wal Nihayah state that Abdullah's troops were completely surrounded by Gregory's army in a circular fashion and the situation was very dire for the Muslim army as they were threatened with annihilation. However, Abdullah ibn Zubayr spotted Gregory in his chariot and soon he asked Abdullah ibn Sa'd to lead a small detachment to intercept him. The interception was successful, and Gregory was slain by Zubayr's ambush party. Consequently, the morale of Byzantine army started crumbling <b>and</b> <b>soon</b> <b>they</b> were routed.|$|E
25|$|India played South Africa in {{the second}} Semi-Final of the tournament on 13 October 2000 at Gymkhana Club Ground, Nairobi, Kenya.

Sourav Ganguly scored a {{brilliant}} century scoring 141 runs facing 142 balls he was not out throughout the innings and India scored the mammoth total of 295 runs losing 6 wickets. South African openers could not give their team a good start as both Kirsten and Hall {{were back in the}} pavilion for just the score of 23 in 4 overs <b>and</b> <b>soon</b> <b>they</b> were reduced to 50/4 then Jonty Rhodes, Mark Boucher and Lance Klusener steadied the innings for some extent but that could not help too much as they were bowled out for 200 and lost the match by 95 runs.

25|$|Columbanus and {{his companions}} were {{received}} with favour by King Gontram of Burgundy, <b>and</b> <b>soon</b> <b>they</b> {{made their way to}} Annegray, where they founded a monastery in an abandoned Roman fortress. Despite its remote location in the Vosges Mountains, the community became a popular pilgrimage site that attracted so many monastic vocations that two new monasteries had to be formed to accommodate them. In 590, Columbanus obtained from King Gontram the Gallo-Roman castle called Luxovium in present-day Luxeuil-les-Bains, some eight miles from Annegray. The castle, soon transformed into a monastery, was located in a wild region, thickly covered with pine forests and brushwood. Columbanus erected a third monastery called Ad-fontanas at present-day Fontaine-lès-Luxeuil, named for its numerous springs. These monastic communities remained under Columbanus' authority, and their rules of life reflected the Irish tradition in which he had been formed. As these communities expanded and drew more pilgrims, Columbanus sought greater solitude, spending periods of time in a hermitage and communicating with the monks through an intermediary. Often he would withdraw to a cave seven miles away, with a single companion who acted as messenger between himself {{and his companions}}.|$|E
