40|$|<b>Attitudes</b> <b>and</b> {{beliefs are}} {{analyzed}} as verbal behavior. It {{is argued that}} shaping by a verbal community {{is an essential part}} of the formation and maintenance of both <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> beliefs, and it is suggested that verbal communities mediate the important shift in control from events in the environment (<b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> beliefs as tacts) to control by other words (<b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> beliefs as intraverbals). It appears that both <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> beliefs are constantly being socially negotiated through autoclitic functions. That is, verbal communities reinforce (a) reporting general rather than specific <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> beliefs, (b) presentation of intraverbals as if they were tacts, and (c) presentation of beliefs as if they were <b>attitudes.</b> Consistency among <b>and</b> between <b>attitudes,</b> beliefs, <b>and</b> behavior is also contingent upon the reinforcing practices of verbal communities. Thus, <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> beliefs can be studied as social behavior rather than as private, cognitive processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to measure student <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>and</b> conceptions about statistics, both before and after an {{introductory}} undergraduate college statistics class. Relationships between those <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> conceptions, as well as their relationships to achievement in statistics, were also studied. Significant correlations were found between student <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> achievement, both at the beginning and end of the course. A low, but significant, correlation was found between positive <b>attitudes</b> toward statistics <b>and</b> accurate conceptions about statistics in the posttest but not in the pretest. Although it was found that there was no change in student <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> conceptions over the course of the semester, students did have more positive <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> correct conceptions than expected. Additionally, instructor interviews revealed that the most common technique employed to improve student <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> conceptions was the use of real-world applications.

The study was carried out in January 2015 in English Language Teaching (ELT) Department at Hacettepe University.

A total of 104 undergraduate students (females: 76 and males: 28) enrolled in the department voluntarily participated in the study. Further quantitative data were also gathered from the participants’ cumulative grade point average (GPA) scores and their gender.

In a micro perspective, the potential mismatch between gender equality (i. e., the actual sharing taking place in a couple) and gender ideology (i. e., <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> beliefs regarding gender roles) may drive childbearing decisions.

Methods : Relying on two-wave panel data of the Bulgarian, Czech, French, Hungarian, and Lithuanian Generations and Gender Surveys, we build a couple typology defined by gender <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> housework-sharing.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the policy of}} teaching science and mathematics in English in the Malaysian educational system {{by focusing on the}} <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> achievement orientations of secondary school students towards the learning of these two subjects. <b>Attitudes</b> <b>and</b> achievement are two important outcomes of learning that will determine the effectiveness of an education policy. This study is based on a sample of 400 secondary school students selected from four non-premier schools. It looks into the students’ general <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> achievement orientations towards learning of science and mathematics as well as their variations according to four background variables, i. e., gender, ethnicity, types of feeder school and English achievement grades. It also examines the inter-correlations between the students’ <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> achievement orientations. Findings from statistical analyses of collected data were supplemented by more in-depth interviews. This study shows that the students’ general <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> achievement orientations towards learning of science and mathematics in English do not indicate that the policy has achieved its objective. However, their <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> achievement motivations vary according to the four background variables. The significant and positive inter-correlations between <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> achievement orientations towards learning of science and mathematics further confirm the causal relationship between these two important dimensions of learning...|$|R

Author William McKeen of Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology commented that with the song, Madonna became the last word in <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> fashion for young girls of that time. He compared that image of Madonna with that of Barbie. McKeen explained that Madonna intermixed middle-class ideas of femininity with examples of what femininity meant to her, which was having equal opportunity. She offered an aggressive sexuality that implied it was acceptable for women not only to initiate relationships, but also enjoy them.|$|E

The failure of the February plot, the lack of bases in Southeast Asia following China's participation {{in the war in}} 1917, and the problems of supporting a Southeast Asian operation through the sea stemmed the plans significantly.
