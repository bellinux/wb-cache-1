Not only was she sent alone by Tim to conduct the negotiations, she also failed to charm him and paid little attention to his artwork, instead focusing entirely on figures. Lord Sugar remarked that the team's loss was purely down to losing Lewis and that Kirsty held responsibility for this.|$|E
25|$|Torquay is {{situated}} on the southwestern coast of England, forming one third of Torbay, {{on the western side}} of the bay. It has a mild microclimate, receiving among the longest hours of sunlight per day in the south west of the United Kingdom, with winters that tend to be mild and wet. The record low temperature of −8.9C was recorded in 1940 and again in 1947. A record high temperature of 31.5C was recorded on 14 July 2013 at 5:30 pm, humidity meant that the temperature <b>actually</b> <b>felt</b> more like 40C.|$|E

5000|$|The hero of Flamborough {{may have}} been rationalizing to conceal less lofty motives. Samuel Eliot Morison {{strongly}} endorsed this hypothesis: [...] "The conclusion is inescapable, that Jones was not particularly eager to regain command of Alliance.

25|$|Cognitive {{skills and}} emotion work skills are {{separate}} but related dimensions for successful job performance. The former includes {{the application of}} factual knowledge to the intellectual analysis for problems and rational decision making. The latter includes analysis and decision making {{in terms of the}} expression of emotion, whether <b>actually</b> <b>felt</b> or not, as well as its opposite: the suppression of emotions that are felt but not expressed. More specifically, emotional labor comes into play during communication between worker and citizens, and it requires the rapid-fire execution of, emotive sensing, analyzing, judging, and behaving.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{cassettes}} {{themselves were}} relatively durable, the players required regular maintenance to perform properly. Head cleaning may {{be done with}} long swabs, soaked with isopropyl alcohol, or cassette-shaped devices that could be inserted into a tape deck to remove buildup of iron-oxide from the heads, tape-drive capstan, and pinch-roller. Some otherwise normal recording tapes included sections of leader that could clean the tape heads. One of {{the concerns of the}} time however was the use of abrasive cleaning tape. Some of the cleaning tapes <b>actually</b> <b>felt</b> rough to the touch and were considered damaging to the heads. Similarly shaped demagnetizers used magnets to degauss the deck, which kept sound from becoming distorted (see Cassette demagnetizer).|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Hilary Busis {{wished the}} episode [...] "had {{done more to}} move the show's master plot forward, {{especially}} since watching it meant missing the first hour of the Golden Globes." [...] Busis also wished that Caulfield had received more screen time, calling her performance [...] "superbly creepy." [...] IGN columnist Amy Ratcliffe rated the episode 6.5/10, explaining that the tone was [...] "over-the-top" [...] and Emma's actions to hide the children, rather than report them, [...] "out of character." [...] Ratcliffe added on a more positive note that the Hansel and Gretel storyline was a [...] "safe choice, but they made it work." [...] Cassandra Scrimgeour of The Huffington Post found [...] "Parrilla's emotional reaction to the children's rejection [...] so effective that despite her evil ways, I <b>actually</b> <b>felt</b> sorry for her." [...] Scrimgeour concluded that [...] "the most intriguing thing to happen" [...] in the episode was {{the arrival of the}} Stranger.|$|E
500|$|The colt {{arrived at}} Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky, on April 28, 2014. He was {{flown in from}} California, his first time on a plane, and {{traveled}} quietly. Once the plane landed, however, his travel idiosyncrasy was discovered by the waiting press when he refused to be unloaded until he was turned around and backed down the ramp; Alan Sherman explained later that this was also his typical manner of egress from ground-based transportation. [...] Upon arrival at Churchill Downs, the horses entered in the Kentucky Derby each were given a special saddle cloth to wear while exercising on the track, identifying them as Derby contenders and including their name. [...] The one given to California Chrome contained a typographical error, with California misspelled as [...] "Califorina". He wore it the first day and then the track management obtained one with the correct spelling. Critics commented that bringing the horse in late and not giving him a full workout on the track was a mistake, but Sherman's strategy was backed by Lukas. [...] In {{the days leading up}} to the race, California Chrome galloped on the track, was walked in the saddling paddock, and schooled at the starting gate. Willie Delgado later remarked that the horse did not particularly like that particular track, saying [...] "he never <b>actually</b> <b>felt</b> comfortable on it." ...|$|E
500|$|A neo {{soul and}} R album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill {{incorporates}} musical styles such as soul, hip hop, and reggae. Some songs {{are based in}} hip hop soul. [...] "When It Hurts So Bad" [...] is musically old roots reggae mixed with soul. While mostly in English, [...] "Forgive Them Father" [...] and [...] "Lost Ones" [...] both feature singing in patois, which is the common dialect in Jamaica. Although heavily R, the song [...] "Superstar" [...] contains an interpolation of the rock song [...] "Light My Fire" [...] by The Doors. Hill said that she [...] "didn't {{want to come out}} with a [...] type of sound", but create [...] "something that was uniquely and very clearly a Lauryn Hill album." [...] She also said that she did not intend for the album's sound to be commercially appealing: [...] "There's too much pressure to have hits these days. Artists are watching Billboard instead of exploring themselves. Look at someone like Aretha, she didn't hit with her first album, but she was able to grow up and find herself. I wanted to make honest music. I don't like things to be too perfect, or too polished. People may criticize me for that, but I grew up listening to Al Green and Sam Cooke. When they hit a high note, you <b>actually</b> <b>felt</b> it." ...|$|E

500|$|Ruck had {{previously}} auditioned for the Bender role in The Breakfast Club which went to Judd Nelson, but Hughes remembered Ruck and cast {{him as the}} 17-year-old Cameron Frye. According to Hughes, the character of Cameron was largely based on {{a friend of his}} in high school. [...] "He was sort of a lost person. His family neglected him, so he took that as license to really pamper himself. When he was legitimately sick, he <b>actually</b> <b>felt</b> good, because it was difficult and tiring to have to invent diseases but when he actually had something, he was relaxed." [...] Ruck said the role of Cameron had originally been offered to Emilio Estevez who turned it down. [...] "Every time I see Emilio, I want to kiss him", said Ruck. [...] "Thank you!" [...] Ruck, then 29, worried about the age difference. [...] "I was worried that I'd be 10 years out of step, and I wouldn't know anything about what was cool, what was hip, all that junk. But when I was going to high school, I didn't know any of that stuff then, either. So I just thought, well, hell—I'll just be me. The character, he's such a loner that he really wouldn't give a damn about that stuff anyway. He'd feel guilty that he didn't know it, but that's it." [...] Ruck was not surprised to find himself cast young. [...] "No, because, really, when I was 18, I sort of looked 12", he said. [...] "Maybe it's a genetic imbalance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Silas is {{described}} as [...] "sinister" [...] and [...] "scary". Rawle said that Silas is [...] "very interesting" [...] and complex. Hollyoaks series producer, Paul Marquess, called him mild-mannered and likened him to a bogeyman. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy described Silas as a dual role of the affable older man and sinister killer. Rawle explained that Silas is [...] "old-fashioned" [...] and dislikes women who have loose morals. Silas actually appeared to enjoy killing people and although he mockingly apologised {{to some of his}} victims, he clearly didn't mean those apologies. There are only two known murders that he <b>actually</b> <b>felt</b> regret for; murdering his own daughter and killing India but these instances have not stopped him from killing people. The official Hollyoaks website said of Silas: [...] "Eep! Who knew that when Heidi’s cuddly dad Silas showed up in the village he {{would turn out to be}} the local serial killer with a penchant for strangulation?" [...] They also call him a [...] "killer grandad". Silas becomes more unstable and in October 2011, Rawle said [...] "He's a psychopath and he has slightly lost the plot now. He's very dangerous. He thinks he hasn't got a lot of time left to live and feels he has nothing to lose." ...|$|E
2500|$|Theisen placed {{second at}} the Canadian Track and Field Championships {{and went on}} to finish {{eleventh}} in the heptathlon at the 2012 London Olympics. A score of 6376 points at the 2013 Hypo Meeting was enough to win the high-profile event ahead of Tatyana Chernova, and she formed a rare Canadian combined events double alongside the men's winner Damian Warner. The 2013 World Championships in Athletics was a wide open event in the heptathlon in that two of the world's best competitors in Chernova and Jessica Ennis-Hill both missed the competition as a result of injuries. Despite putting up a personal best 6,530 points, she had to settle for silver, just 56 points behind eventual World Champion Hanna Melnichenko. After Gotzis, this was the second major competition in a row where the Canadian men and women multi-eventers had a double medal meeting after Warner won bronze at the world championships; however, a double gold for the power couple of Eaton and Eaton-Theisen was narrowly missed. She commented on her achievement saying [...] "I'm at peace getting silver knowing I gave it 110 per cent. Ashton and I talked about both being on the podium here. I watched Ashton {{the last couple of years}} winning his medals and could only imagine what that <b>actually</b> <b>felt</b> like." [...] In her last outing that year, she was third at the Decastar meet in France.|$|E

This paper aims at assessing the impact of this economic crisis on employment, unemployment and the informal sector. Contrarily to previous studies on this subject, we anticipate a very small increase of unemployment. According to our estimates, most {{of the impact of the}} crisis in terms of employment will <b>actually</b> be <b>felt</b> in the informal sector, where most new entrants on the labour market and laid(off workers will end up working. This feature will result in an urgent need to put in place specific policies to tackle informal sector low productivity and its manpower's lack of labour protection. ...|$|R
