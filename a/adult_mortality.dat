A dose range of 0. 025, 0. 100, 0. 400, 1. 000 and 4. 000 micro g/insect was topically applied on 1 day old 3 rd larval instar and the newly moulted pupae. The larval mortality was increased by increasing RH- 5849 doses. The pupal and <b>adult</b> <b>mortalities</b> which resulted from treated larvae were increased by decreasing doses. Pupal deformation was increased (40. 3 %) due {{to the effect of}} the dose (1. 000 micro g/larva). Although there were some various deformities in the adult stage, no certain trend could be encountered for the adult deformities. Adults were affected by RH- 5849 at the dose levels of 4. 000 and 1. 000 micro g/larva. In case of treated pupae with RH- 549, the percentage of pupal mortalities were increased by increasing the dose levels.

5|$|The average {{lifespan}} of {{bald eagles}} {{in the wild}} is around 20 years, with the oldest confirmed one having been 38 years of age. In captivity, they often live somewhat longer. In one instance, a captive individual in New York lived for nearly 50 years. As with size, the average lifespan of an eagle population appears {{to be influenced by}} its location and access to prey. As they are no longer heavily persecuted, <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> is quite low. In one study of Florida eagles, adult bald eagles reportedly had 100% annual survival rate. In Prince William Sound in Alaska, adults had an annual survival rate of 88% even after the Exxon Valdez oil spill adversely affected eagles in the area. Of 1,428 individuals from across the range necropsied by National Wildlife Health Center from 1963 to 1984, 329 (23%) eagles died from trauma, primarily impact with wires and vehicles; 309 (22%) died from gunshot; 158 (11%) died from poisoning; 130 (9%) died from electrocution; 68 (5%) died from trapping; 110 (8%) from emaciation; and 31 (2%) from disease; cause of death was undetermined in 293 (20%) of cases. In this study, 68% of mortality was human-caused. Today eagle-shooting is believed to be considerably reduced due to the species protected status. In one case, an adult eagle investigating a peregrine falcon nest for prey items sustained a concussion from a swooping parent peregrine, and ultimately died days later from it. An early natural history video depicting a cougar (Puma concolor) ambushing and killing an immature bald eagle feeding at a rabbit carcass is viewable online although this film may have been staged.|$|E

500|$|Laying {{starts at}} the end of April into early May. The eggs are whitish with very indistinct buff, grey or brown {{markings}} at the broad end. The eggs are [...] and weigh , of which 5% is shell. The clutch size in Europe is typically 9–11 eggs, but ranges from 6–13. The eggs are piled up in the nest and the female keeps the eggs warm with her brood patch and also by putting her warm legs {{into the middle of the}} pile between the eggs. Within a clutch the size of eggs increases gradually and the last laid egg may be 20% larger than the first egg. Second clutches, which are common, are laid usually while the first nest still has young. The male builds the second nest, then feeds the young in the first nest while the female is incubating in the second; when the first brood has fledged, he joins the female in feeding the second brood. The female goldcrest is not normally fed by her mate while incubating. She is a tight sitter, reluctant to leave the nest when disturbed, and has been recorded as continuing to attend the nest when it has been moved, or even when it is being held. The eggs are maintained at , the female regulating the temperature of the eggs by varying the time spent sitting. She leaves the nest more with increasing air temperature, and incubates more tightly when the light intensity is lower early and late in the day. The female incubates the eggs for 16 to 19 days to hatching, and broods the chicks, which fledge in a further 17 to 22 days later. Both parents feed the chicks and fledged young, and in very hot weather, the female has been noted as taking drops of water to her chicks in her bill. This species becomes sexually mature after one year, and has an annual <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> of over 80 percent giving a life expectancy of around eight months, which is the shortest for any bird apart from a few Coturnix species.

2500|$|Which {{particular}} nation {{an impoverished}} person lives in deeply affects health outcomes. This {{can be attributed}} to governmental, environmental, geographical, and cultural factors. Using life expectancy as a measure of health indicates a difference between countries in likeliness of living to a certain age. Where people are born dramatically impacts their life chances. High-income countries like Japan or Sweden have a life expectancy of 80 years, Brazil-72, India-63.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] The aim was {{to examine}} whether blood pressure, body build, and birthweight differ between areas of England and Wales with widely differing <b>adult</b> {{cardiovascular}} <b>mortality</b> rates. DESIGN [...] This was a cross sectional survey of children in five towns with exceptionally high and five towns with exceptionally low current <b>adult</b> cardiovascular <b>mortality.</b> SETTING [...] The study was a school based survey. SUBJECTS [...] 3842 children aged 5. 0 - 7. 5 years were selected by stratified random sampling of primary schools (response rate 76 %). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] Blood pressure, pulse rate, height, and weight were measured and birthweight was assessed by maternal recall. Children in towns with high cardiovascular mortality rates were significantly shorter than those in towns with low cardiovascular mortality rates (mean difference 0. 9 cm, 95 % confidence interval 0. 4 to 1. 4 cm) and had slightly higher body mass indices (mean difference 0. 12 kg/m 2, 95 % CI - 0. 03 to 0. 27 kg/m 2). Mean birthweights were slightly lower in high mortality towns (mean difference 34 g, 95 % CI - 10 to 78 g), while the proportion of children with low birthweight (< 2500 g) (8. 1 %) {{was significantly higher than}} that in low mortality towns (5. 5 %) (p = 0. 005). Mean differences in blood pressure between high and low mortality towns were small and non-significant, even after adjustment for height. The differences in height between high and low mortality towns were largely independent of social class. However, differences in mean birthweight were markedly reduced once social class was taken into account. CONCLUSIONS [...] No geographical relationship between childhood blood pressure and <b>adult</b> cardiovascular <b>mortality</b> was detected. Although {{it is possible that the}} differences in mean height and body mass index between towns with differing <b>adult</b> cardiovascular <b>mortality</b> may have implications for future patterns of health in these towns, the absence of marked differences in birthweight and blood pressure suggests that hypotheses proposing a direct relationship between intrauterine experience and <b>adult</b> cardiovascular <b>mortality</b> will have limited relevance to geographical variation in cardiovascular disease in this generation...|$|R

2500|$|Campbell {{has studied}} the {{demography}} of 19th-century Madagascar {{in the light of}} demographic transition theory. Both supporters and critics of the theory hold to an intrinsic opposition between human and [...] "natural" [...] factors, such as climate, famine, and disease, influencing demography. They also suppose a sharp chronological divide between the precolonial and colonial eras, arguing that whereas [...] "natural" [...] demographic influences were of greater importance in the former period, human factors predominated thereafter. Campbell argues that in 19th-century Madagascar the human factor, {{in the form of the}} Merina state, was the predominant demographic influence. However, the impact of the state was felt through natural forces, and it varied over time. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries Merina state policies stimulated agricultural production, which helped to create a larger and healthier population and laid the foundation for Merina military and economic expansion within Madagascar. From 1820, the cost of such expansionism led the state to increase its exploitation of forced labor at the expense of agricultural production and thus transformed it into a negative demographic force. [...] Infertility and infant mortality, which were probably more significant influences on overall population levels than the <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> rate, increased from 1820 due to disease, malnutrition, and stress, all of which stemmed from state forced labor policies. Available estimates indicate little if any population growth for Madagascar between 1820 and 1895. The demographic [...] "crisis" [...] in Africa, ascribed by critics of the demographic transition theory to the colonial era, stemmed in Madagascar from the policies of the imperial Merina regime, which in this sense formed a link to the French regime of the colonial era. Campbell thus questions the underlying assumptions governing the debate about historical demography in Africa and suggests that the demographic impact of political forces be reevaluated in terms of their changing interaction with [...] "natural" [...] demographic influences.|$|E
