5|$|In 2005, Sandi Willows-Munro (of the University of KwaZulu-Natal) {{and colleagues}} {{carried out a}} {{mitochondrial}} analysis of the nine Tragelaphus species. mtDNA and nDNA data were compared. The {{results showed that the}} tribe Tragelaphini is monophyletic with the lesser kudu basal in the phylogeny, followed by the nyala (T. angasii). On the basis of mitochondrial data, studies have estimated that the lesser kudu separated from its sister clade around 13.7 million years <b>ago.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, the nuclear data shows that lesser kudu and nyala form a clade, and collectively separated from the sister clade 13.8 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Activity {{after the}} caldera's {{formation}} created lava domes and rhyolitic lava flows along its ring faults. One flow was dated at 1,090,000 ± 110,000 years old, and the domes are 1.4 to 1.2 million years old. La Reforma eruption products were later partially buried by activity from El Aguajito, where volcanic activity had migrated to. Basaltic cones which erupted 600,000 years <b>ago</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> caldera's flanks despite their location {{are not part}} of the La Reforma volcano; like Isla Tortuga and Tres Virgenes, they are controlled by the tectonic processes that accompanied the rifting of the Sea of Cortez. Also, rivers deposited sediments inside the caldera itself. Seismic activity still occurs at Tres Virgenes volcano. La Reforma could still experience large scale explosive volcanism, especially in its southwestern part.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, {{two studies}} further pinpointed the {{responsible}} region to chromosome 11 and a 4.5-Mb covering chromosomal rearrangement. The scientists {{were able to}} show that the first genetic change happened 3.8 million years <b>ago</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> resident chromosome, when a part of it broke off and was reintroduced in the wrong direction. This inversion created the faeder allele. About 500,000 years ago another rare recombination event of faeder and resident allele in the very same inverted region lead to the satellite allele. The 4.5 Mb inversion covers 90 genes, {{one of them is the}} centromere coding gene N- CENPN-, which is located exactly at one of the inversion breakpoints. The inactivation of the gene has severe deleterious effects and pedigree data of a captive ruff colony suggests that the inversion is homozygous lethal. Over the course of the past 3.8 million years, further mutations have accumulated within the inversion i.e. three deletions ranging from 3.3 to 17.6 kb. Two of these deletions remove evolutionary highly conserved elements close to two genes- HSD17B2 and SDR42E1-both holding important roles in metabolism of steroid hormones. Hormone measurements around mating time showed that whereas residents have a sharp increase of testosterone, faeders and satellites only experience higher androstenedione levels, a substance which is considered an intermediate in testosterone biosynthesis. The authors conclude that one or more of the deletions act as a cis-acting regulatory mutation which is altering the expression of one or both genes and eventually contributes to the different male phenotypes and behaviour.|$|E

5|$|The Kirtlandian faunal age {{was named}} by Lucas and Sullivan in 2003, and found by their {{original}} study to date from 74.9 to 72million years ago. In 2006, Sullivan and Lucas refined their estimate, {{stating that the}} Kirtlandian ranged from 75 to 72.8million years ago. Later that year, Sullivan changed the time range again, finding that the faunal age lasted only 2 million years, from 74.8 to 72.8million years ago. He said that the later part of the Kirtlandian, from the De-na-zin Member of the Kirtland Formation, dated to 73 million years <b>ago,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of ash layers dating to 73.04 and 73.37million years ago. This observation was based on findings by Sullivan and Lucas, who dated the two ash layers from 73.04 ± 0.25 and 73.37 ± 0.28million years ago. They also dated the earlier ashes from the Fruitland Formation, which dated to 75.56 ± 0.41, 74.55 ± 0.29, and 74.11 ± 0.62 million years ago. The first ash, called by them the Dog Eye Pond, was found slightly higher than {{the start of the}} Fruitland Formation, which meant that the start of the Fruitland Formation was older than 75.5 million years ago. More precise dating in 2010 by Longrich found that the second youngest ash can actually be dated more precisely than thought by Sullivan (2006), only having an error range of 0.18million years. Longrich also dated the two older ashes, finding a date {{the same as that of}} Sullivan in 2006. These ash datings are what Sullivan used to find the precise age of the Kirtlandian age.|$|E

Good identified Australia as its own floristic kingdom, and included New Guinea and New Caledonia in the Paleotropical floristic kingdom, because of the influx of tropical Eurasian flora that had mostly supplanted the Antarctic flora.|$|E

However, the Thunder lost their following four games and it looked as if they were set to miss out on the finals. In their final game of the 2015–16 Big Bash League season, the Thunder defeated the Sixers for only the second time in their history to book a finals berth. The Thunder faced the Adelaide Strikers at Adelaide Oval in the first semi final, winning convincingly. The Thunder then faced the Stars in the Finals the Melbourne Stars. The final was played at Melbourne Cricket Ground on 24 January 2016 and resulted in the Thunder's defeat of the Melbourne Stars.

These mammoths presumably reached the islands by swimming there when sea levels were lower, and decreased in size due to the limited food provided by the islands' small areas. Bones of larger specimens have also been found on the islands, but it is unknown whether these were stages in the dwarfing process, or later arrivals of Columbian mammoths.|$|E

The location of the vent did not change {{during the course of}} the eruption, indicating that the annular fractures around the caldera were possibly uninvolved in the process. The low population density in the Fiambalá valley south of the volcano during the 10,000–3,000 B.P interval is ascribed to this eruption.|$|E

500|$|There is {{evidence}} of glaciation during the CoropunaI stage of volcanic activity; the mountain was glaciated {{at least since the}} Pliocene. During the Last Glacial Maximum, Coropuna's longest glacier was the -long Quebrada Ullulo glacier, and the ice cap covered a surface area of at least [...] Outlet glaciers descended to [...] and [...] altitude on the northern and southern flank, respectively. Equilibrium line altitudes ranged from [...] on the northern side to [...] on the southern side.

In addition to Ullulo on the northern flank, other outlet glaciers were Huayllaura and Quipchane on the southern flank, Pucunchiloyocc on the western flank, and Cospanjaon on the eastern flank. Based on chlorine-36 accumulation data on moraines, it has been determined that the volcano underwent a major expansion between 20,000 and 16,000 years ago, a minor expansion 12,000 to 11,000 years ago, and another minor expansion 9,000 years <b>ago.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> southern flank, a major expansion took place 14,000 years ago and a minor one 10,000–9,000 years ago.
