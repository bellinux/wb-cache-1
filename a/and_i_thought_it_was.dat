It's {{an homage to}} her, because I've never seen anyone re-create it. So many people have emulated so many of Marilyn's classic moments, but it's just that I'm {{a big fan of}} hers, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> really pretty at night with the pool. No one could ever be as fabulous as Marilyn was, but it's in honor and homage to her.|$|E

I didn't hear a word she said, but the visual was spot on." [...] Palin [...] "and the press corps watched the sketch {{in the back of her}} plane, {{laughing}} at Tina and Amy's satirical take on the two politicians," [...] and Palin later claimed that she had once dressed up as Fey for Halloween. However, Carly Fiorina, a spokeswoman for the John McCain campaign argued that the sketch portrayed Hillary Clinton as [...] "very substantive," [...] but Fiorina thought, in the case of Sarah Palin, that she was portrayed as [...] "totally superficial." [...] Fiorina thought the sketch was [...] "disrespectful in the extreme" [...] and [...] "sexist." ...|$|E
500|$|McCain was {{mentioned}} as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination beginning in 1997, but he took few steps to pursue it, instead concentrating on his 1998 senate re-election. [...] The decision of General Colin Powell not to run helped persuade McCain {{that there might be}} an opening for him. [...] McCain later wrote that he had a [...] "vague aspiration" [...] of running for president for a long time. [...] He would also be candid about his motivation: [...] "I didn't decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms I believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism. In truth, I wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to become president. I was sixty-two years old when I made the decision, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> my one shot at the prize." ...|$|E

500|$|Timmons became {{best known}} as a member of Art Blakey's band the Jazz Messengers, which he was first part of from July 1958 to September 1959, {{including}} for a tour of Europe. He was recruited for the Messengers by saxophonist Benny Golson, who said that [...] "He was inventive, [...] He could play bebop and he could play funky – he could play a lot of things, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the element that Art needed. He hadn't had anybody quite like Bobby, who could go here or go there, rather than walking in a single corridor." [...] By late 1958 Timmons was sharing bandmate Morgan's East Sixth Street apartment and the pair had bought a piano, allowing Timmons to practice and Morgan to work on composing. From around the time he joined Blakey, Timmons, along with some of his fellow band members, was a heroin user. After leaving Blakey, Timmons joined Cannonball Adderley's band, in October 1959.|$|E
500|$|On April 25, 2007, the duo {{announced}} that they would embark {{on a tour of}} Canada performing in all 10 provinces, plus Yukon, Nunavut and Northwest Territories. In the words of Jack: [...] "Having never done a tour of Canada, Meg <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> high time to go whole hog. We want to take this tour to {{the far reaches of the}} Canadian landscape. From the ocean to the permafrost. The best way for us to do that is ensure that we perform in every province and territory in the country, from the Yukon to Prince Edward Island. Another special moment of this tour is the show which will occur in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia on July 14, The White Stripes' Tenth Anniversary." [...] Canadian fiddler Ashley MacIsaac opened for the band at the Glace Bay show; earlier in 2007, MacIsaac and Jack had discovered that they were distantly related. It was also at this time that White learned he was related to Canadian fiddle player Natalie MacMaster.|$|E
500|$|... "Trust No 1" [...] {{was written}} by series creator Chris Carter along with {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz; it was directed by Tony Wharmby. The episode features former leading star David Duchovny via the use of previously shot footage. According to Matt Hurwitz and Chris Knowles in their book The Complete X-Files, the episode includes themes [...] "about Orwellian surveillance." [...] "Trust No 1" [...] was written in response to fans who felt that, during season eight, Mulder's abduction was not dealt with until his miraculous return in [...] "This is Not Happening"/"DeadAlive". Despite this, series director Kim Manners was critical of this take on Mulder, noting, [...] "The only thing I thought we didn't do right during seasons eight and nine was {{that a lot of}} the shows were about Mulder, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a mistake to make a series about a man that wasn't standing in front of the camera." [...] The email addresses that Mulder and Scully use to communicate with each other were real addresses, created and maintained by Ten Thirteen Productions. The tagline for the episode is [...] "They're Watching", changed from the usual [...] "The Truth is Out There".|$|E

500|$|Showrunner Al Jean {{noted in}} an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly that it was easy to cast Lynch, since [...] "she can do edge, sweetness, and a mix of both". He further noted that the crew was happy when she agreed to take the role, and that he was [...] "embarrassed [...] didn’t ask her before she was so successful because she’s funny in everything she does." [...] Lynch recorded her scenes together with cast member Dan Castellaneta, who voices Homer. In an interview with the website Hollywood Outbreak, she commented that [...] "It was pretty amazing to {{every once in a while}} look up at his face and go 'Oh my God, it's that guy that does that voice.'" [...] Lynch added that she [...] "had the best time. I would do it again and again. This is kind of very much a milestone in my career. I will point to this as a big deal." [...] In an interview with Fox All Access, Lynch revealed that she is a longtime fan: [...] "Indeed I am a fan of The Simpsons. I started watching twenty years ago. I remember the first season. I remember clearly moments from the episodes <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> revolutionary, the comedy of it. I really loved it." ...|$|E
500|$|The Kinks {{started out}} playing the then popular R and blues styles; then, under the {{influence}} of The Kingsmen's [...] "Louie Louie" [...] recording, developed louder rock and hard rock sounds — due to their pioneering contribution to the field, they have often been labelled as [...] "the original punks". Dave Davies was [...] "really bored with this guitar sound – or lack of an interesting sound" [...] so he purchased [...] "a little green amplifier ... an Elpico" [...] from a radio spares shop in Muswell Hill, and [...] "twiddled around with it", including [...] "taking the wires going to the speaker and putting a jack plug on there and plugging it straight into my AC3O" [...] (a larger amplifier), but didn't get the sound he wanted until he got frustrated and [...] "got a single-sided Gillette razorblade and cut round the cone ... so it was all shredded but still on there, still intact. I played <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> amazing." [...] The jagged sound of the amplifier was replicated in the studio; the Elpico was plugged into the Vox AC30, and the resulting effect became a mainstay in The Kinks' early recordings—most notably on [...] "You Really Got Me" [...] and [...] "All Day and All of the Night".|$|E
500|$|She {{lived for}} a few months in a flat Starr owned at 34 Montagu Square, central London, but {{returned}} to Kenwood as Lennon and Ono preferred to live there instead, rather than in isolated Weybridge. Lennon and Cynthia had one last short meeting at Kenwood (with Ono alongside Lennon), where Lennon accused her of having an affair in India, saying she was no [...] "innocent little flower". McCartney visited her and Julian that year, and on the way to Kenwood he composed a song in his head which later became [...] "Hey Jude". Talking about their divorce, McCartney later said: [...] "We'd been very good friends for millions of years <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a bit much for them suddenly to be personae non gratae and out of my life". Cynthia recalled, [...] "I was truly surprised when, one afternoon, Paul arrived on his own. I was touched by his obvious concern for our welfare ... On the journey down he composed 'Hey Jude' in the car. I will never forget Paul's gesture of care and concern in coming to see us." [...] She was once asked if Lennon had written any songs about their time together, and answered: [...] "It was too sloppy when you were young to dedicate anything to anybody. Macho Northern men didn't do that in those days". In contrast, Lennon said he wrote the 1965 song [...] "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)" [...] about an affair he was having, but rendered it in [...] "gobbledegook" [...] so Cynthia would not know.|$|E

500|$|Born in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, Bridges {{began his}} career with local side Cambridge United, whom he joined {{at the age of}} 8, he progressed through the club's youth system before signing his first {{professional}} contract in February 2002. He broke into the first-team {{towards the end of the}} 2001–02 season, making his debut as a substitute in a 1–0 defeat against Huddersfield Town at the Abbey Stadium. He played six further games in the same season, scoring his first goal for Cambridge in a 2–1 home win against Tranmere Rovers. Bridges featured regularly in the opening half of the 2002–03 season, playing a total of 25 times and scoring once in a 3–0 victory against York City. However, a [...] "persistent" [...] ankle injury cut his run in the first-team short, and he did not feature from February onwards. He returned to first-team action in a 1–0 defeat to Wycombe Wanderers in October 2003, and played a further 22 times for the club throughout the 2003–04 campaign. However, Bridges left Cambridge at the end of the season after failing to agree a contract extension. On leaving Cambridge, Bridges said [...] "I was offered a contract that was almost a kick in the teeth after the time I had been at the club when players were coming in from all over the place who did not care about the club. They were getting paid five or six times what I was offered, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> probably time to move on". During his three seasons with the club, Bridges made a total of 55 appearances in all competitions,scoring four times.|$|E

In 1983 he forbade those around him from using the name of [...] "Steven", which he despised. Morrissey was also responsible for choosing the band name of [...] "The Smiths", later informing an interviewer that [...] "it was the most ordinary name <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time that the ordinary folk of the world showed their faces".|$|E
