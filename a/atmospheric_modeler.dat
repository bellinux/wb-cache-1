40|$|Accurate {{turbulence}} {{estimates are}} important input to atmospheric dispersion models since they characterize downwind dispersion and hence, potential pollutant concentrations. When only basic wind information is available, an <b>atmospheric</b> <b>modeler</b> must first estimate roughness length (z{sub 0 },) at {{the location of}} interest, ({mu}*) from similarity theory using average wind speed ({mu}) and z{sub 0 }, and finally apply experimentally derived relationships to determine the turbulence intensities. Even when turbulence coefficients are measured, the turbulence profile must be estimated in the surface layer, using, for example, the power law recommended in a US Environmental Protection Agency guidance document. In this study, turbulent intensities and wind profiles are analyzed in eight direction sectors during near neutral stability. ``Local`` and ``regional`` roughness lengths are calculated from wind speed profiles and from longitudinal turbulence intensities ({sigma}{sub {mu}}) at both sites. With ``regional`` roughness length, complex terrain features are in effect the roughness elements. Profiles of median, 15 -minute averaged turbulence intensities {sigma}{sub {mu}}, {sigma}{sub {nu}} and {sigma}{sub w} are calculated at both sites. Profiles of median {sigma}{sub {theta}} and {sigma}{sub {phi}} are also calculated using four mean values of regional z{sub 0 } at both sites. Finally, differences between widely-used turbulence relationships and the relationships determined in this study, and their possible effect on model results, are discussed...|$|E

A new technique, based on the use of a micro-channel plate position-sensitive detector, has been developed for studying some of these collision processes. Differential cross sections have been measured over a primary beam energy range of 500 eV to 5000 eV for the scattering of atomic hydrogen, helium, and oxygen on targets of N(, 2), O(, 2), H(, 2), and He at laboratory angles between 0. 08 degrees and 5 degrees.

Remote sensing of the Earth’s energy budget, particularly with instruments flown on geostationary satellites, allows for near-real-time evaluation of cloud and surface radiation properties.

40|$|Abstract. Error {{propagation}} from winds to ocean models was numerically investigated {{using the}} Princeton Ocean Model (POM) for the South China Sea with 20 -km horizontal resolution and 23 • levels conforming to a realistic bottom topography during {{the lifetime of}} tropical cyclone Ernie (November 4 - 18, 1996). Numerical integration was divided into preexperimental and experimental stages. The preexperiment phase generates the initial conditions on November i for the sensitivity experiment. During the experimental stage the POM was integrated from November 1 to 30, 1996 under National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalyzed surface fluxes along with two surface wind data sets, namely, the daily averaged interpolated NASA scatterometer winds and the NCEP winds. The relative root-mean-square differences fluctuate from 0. 5 to 1. 0 for winds, 0. 25 to 0. 7 for surface elevations, 0. 47 to 1. 02 for surface currents, and 0 to 0. 23 for aurface temperatures. This indicates that the model has less uncertainty overall than the wind fields used to drive it, which in turn suggests that the ocean modeling community may progress without waiting for the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>modelers</b> to build the perfect forecast model. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{forecast}} the transport and diffusion of airborne contaminants over long distances is vital when responding to nuclear emergencies. Atmospheric models used in such emergency response applications {{must be able}} to include the effects of the evolving synoptic weather systems in a timely manner. The European Tracer EXperiment (ETEX), conducted in October and November 1994, is designed to evaluate the performance of such models. In addition to the tracer experiments, concurrent real-time modeling exercises were conducted by some 24 organizations world-wide, including the Savannah River Technology Center (SRTC) of the U. S. Department of Energy`s Savannah River Site. This paper describes the forecast results obtained by <b>atmospheric</b> <b>modelers</b> at SRTC in applying an advanced three-dimensional modeling system to forecast tracer transport and diffusion during ETEX. Forecast results from the first of two tracer experiments are presented in this preprint paper. Data for the tracer gas concentrations is not yet available; however, surface and sounding data are available from the time periods of the releases. This paper will focus on the evaluation of the forecasts in light of the surface wind data, and relate the forecast evaluations to the differences in the tracer gas dispersion predicted using these forecasts.

40|$|The optical {{properties}} of combustion-generated soot, crucial information for quantitative soot emission diagnostics and for climate modeling, have been determined {{for the particular}} case of cooled soot from a methane flame. Optical extinction measurements were performed over a wavelength range of 450 - 750 nm using a novel diffuse-light, spectrally resolved line-of-sight attenuation experiment, and quantified using extractive methods coupled with scanning and transmission electron microscopy {{in conjunction with a}} detailed uncertainty analysis. The absorption component of the total measured extinction was isolated by calculating the expected scattering contribution, according to the Rayleigh-Debye-Gans approximation for polydisperse fractal aggregates. In contrast to the large degree of scatter seen in data previously reported in the literature, a consistent trend of negligible variation of the soot absorption refractive index function E(m) with wavelength over the visible was observed (E(m) = 0. 3510. 03 at wavelengths of 450 - 750 nm). These new data are also cast in the form of dimensionless extinction, which is independent of the scatter correction, as well as mass absorption cross section, which is independent of the mass density of soot and is commonly used by <b>atmospheric</b> <b>modelers.</b> 9 2011 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} scenarios for <b>atmospheric</b> <b>modelers</b> is the stable boundary layer (SBL). Airborne material released near the ground will likely be trapped near the ground in high concentrations due to the reduced dispersion in the SBL. Hence the SBL is often the worst case scenario for studies of health impacts from routine or accidental release of toxic materials to the atmosphere. Unfortunately the SBL is very challenging to understand and model correctly. There is also a limited number of field studies with which to verify models, although recent studies (such as CASES- 99) are promising. It is difficult for traditional Reynolds-averaged models of turbulence to capture the weak, spatially- and temporally-varying fluctuations that contribute to dispersion the SBL. Large-eddy simulation (LES) has become a promising approach study the SBL because much of the dynamical structure is explicitly resolved and allowed to develop according to the full equations of motion. The presence of topography further complicates the simulation of SBL flows. The drainage flows that develop as the surface cools must be resolved, along with their interaction with other drainage flows of varying scales and the main forcing (synoptic scale) flow. In this study, we have used LES techniques to simulate flows in complex terrain during the development of the SBL at night. We have begun to evaluate the effects of resolution on the simulations, though this effort is continuing {{at the time of this}} writing. Simulations are conducted for the area around Salt Lake City, where several field activities are planned for the future. The study will be extended to the small scale terrain associated with the CASES- 99 experiment, and comparisons made with observations...|$|R

Additionally, matched comparisons of the high-resolution skin temperature product with MODIS land surface temperature reveal a level of accuracy well within 1 K for both day and night. This confidence will help in characterizing the diurnal and seasonal biases and root-mean-square differences between the retrievals and modeled values from the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System Version 5 (GEOS- 5) in preparation for assimilation of the retrievals into GEOS- 5.

40|$|The {{stabilization}} of high order spectral elements {{to solve the}} transport equations for tracers in the atmosphere remains an active topic of research among <b>atmospheric</b> <b>modelers.</b> This paper builds on our previous work on variational multiscale stabilization (VMS) and discontinuity capturing (DC) [Variational multiscale {{stabilization of}} high-order spectral elements for the advection-di↵usion equation J. Comput. Phys. 231 (2012) 7187 - 7213] and shows the applicability of VMS+DC to realistic atmospheric problems that involve physics coupling with phase change in the simulation of 3 D deep convection. We show that the VMS+DC approach is a robust technique that can damp the high order modes characterizing the spectral element solution of complex coupled transport problems. The method has important properties that techniques of more common use often lack: 1) it is free of a user-defined parameter, 2) it is anisotropic in that it only acts along the flow direction, 3) it is numerically consistent, and 4) it can improve the monotonicity of high-order spectral elements. The proposed method is assessed {{by comparing the results}} against those obtained with a fourth-order hyper-viscosity programmed in the same code. The main conclusion that arises is that tuning can be fully avoided without loss of accuracy if the dissipative scheme is properly designed. Finally, the cost of parallel communication is that of a second order operator which means that fewer communications are required by VMS+DC than by a hyper-viscosity method; fewer communications translate into a faster and more scalable code, which is of vital importance as we approach the exascale range of computing.

40|$|Stellar {{insolation}} {{has been}} used as the main constraint on a planet's habitability. However, as more Earth-like planets are discovered around low-mass stars (LMSs), a re-examination of the role of tides on the habitability of exoplanets has begun. Those studies have yet to consider the misalignment between a planet's rotational axis and the orbital plane normal, i. e. the planetary obliquity. We apply two equilibrium tide theories to compute the obliquity evolution of terrestrial planets orbiting in the habitable zones around LMSs. The time for the obliquity to decrease from an Earth-like obliquity of 23. 5 deg to 5 deg, the 'tilt erosion time', is compared to the traditional insolation habitable zone (IHZ) as a function of semi-major axis, eccentricity, and stellar mass. We also compute tidal heating and equilibrium rotation caused by obliquity tides. The Super-Earth Gl 581 d and the planet candidate Gl 581 g are studied as examples for tidal processes. Earth-like obliquities of terrestrial planets in the IHZ around 0. 9 M_sun experience tilt erosion times larger than 1 Gyr throughout the IHZ. Terrestrial planets in the IHZ of stars with masses 0. 3. In our two-body simulations, Gl 581 d's obliquity is eroded to 0 and its rotation period reached its equilibrium state of half its orbital period in < 0. 1 Gyr. Tidal surface heating on the putative Gl 581 g is < 150 mW/m^ 2 as long as its eccentricity is < 0. 3. Obliquity tides modify the concept of the habitable zone. Tilt erosion of terrestrial planets orbiting LMSs should be included by <b>atmospheric</b> <b>modelers.</b> Tidal heating needs to be considered by geologists.

40|$|International audienceThe {{reaction}} of CN radicals with HC 3 N {{is of interest}} for interstellar and circumstellar chemistry {{as well as for}} the chemistry of Titan's atmosphere, as part of a general scheme for cyanopolyyne synthesis within these low temperature environments. Here, we present the first experimental measurements of its rate coefficient below room temperature down to 22 K, employing the CRESU (Cinétique de Réaction en Ecoulement Supersonique Uniforme or Reaction Kinetics in Uniform Supersonic Flow) technique coupled with pulsed laser photolysis-laser-induced fluorescence. A novel pulsed version of the CRESU technique employing a new spinning disk valve was used for some of the kinetics measurements. The measurements were in excellent agreement with the only previous determination at room temperature and show a marked increase in the rate coefficient as the temperature is lowered, with the results being well represented by the equation k(T) = 1. 79 × 10 (- 11) (T/ 300 K) (- 0. 67) cm(3) molecule(- 1) s(- 1), with a root-mean-square (statistical) error of 0. 61 × 10 (- 11) cm(3) molecule(- 1) s(- 1), to which should be added 10 % estimated likely systematic error. High accuracy ab initio quantum chemical calculations coupled with variational two-transition state theory calculations were also performed and demonstrate excellent agreement within the combined experimental and predicted theoretical uncertainties. The theoretical rate coefficients, adjusted within expected uncertainties, can be accurately reproduced over the 5 to 400 K temperature range by the expression [(1. 97 × 10 (- 8)) T (- 1. 51) exp(- 3. 24 /T) + (4. 85 × 10 (- 13)) T (0. 563) exp (17. 6 /T) ] cm(3) molecule(- 1) s(- 1), where T is in K.

40|$|The {{phase of}} {{precipitation}} {{when it reaches}} the ground is a first-order driver of hydrologic processes in a watershed. The presence of snow, rain, or mixed-phase precipitation affects the initial and boundary conditions that drive hydrological models. Despite their foundational importance to terrestrial hydrology, typical phase partitioning methods (PPMs) specify the phase based on near-surface air temperature only. Our review conveys the diversity of tools available for PPMs in hydrological modeling and the advancements needed to improve predictions in complex terrain with large spatiotemporal variations in precipitation phase. Initially, we review the processes and physics that control precipitation phase as relevant to hydrologists, focusing {{on the importance of}} processes occurring aloft. There is a wide range of options for field observations of precipitation phase, but {{there is a lack of}} a robust observation networks in complex terrain. New remote sensing observations have the potential to increase PPM fidelity, but generally require assumptions typical of other PPMs and field validation before they are operational. We review common PPMs and find that accuracy is generally increased at finer measurement intervals and by including humidity information. One important tool for PPM development is atmospheric modeling, which includes microphysical schemes that have not been effectively linked to hydrological models or validated against near-surface precipitation-phase observations. The review concludes by describing key research gaps and recommendations to improve PPMs, including better incorporation of atmospheric information, improved validation datasets, and regional-scale gridded data products. Two key points emerge from this synthesis for the hydrologic community: (1)  current PPMs are too simple to capture important processes and are not well validated for most locations, (2)  lack of sophisticated PPMs increases the uncertainty in estimation of hydrological sensitivity to changes in precipitation phase at local to regional scales. The advancement of PPMs is a critical research frontier in hydrology that requires scientific cooperation between hydrological and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>modelers</b> and field scientists...|$|R
40|$|The {{predictive}} {{potential of}} air quality models and thus their value in emergency management {{and public health}} support are critically dependent {{on the quality of}} their meteorological inputs. The atmospheric flow is the primary cause of the dispersion of airborne substances. The scavenging of pollutants by cloud particles and precipitation is an important sink of atmospheric pollution and subsequently determines the spatial distribution of the deposition of pollutants. The long-standing problem of the spin-up of clouds and precipitation in numerical weather prediction models limits the accuracy of the prediction of short-range dispersion and deposition from local sources. The resulting errors in the atmospheric concentration of pollutants also affect the initial conditions for the calculation of the long-range transport of these pollutants. Customary the spin-up problem is avoided by only using NWP (Numerical Weather Prediction) forecasts with a lead time greater than the spin-up time of the model. Due to the increase of uncertainty with forecast range this reduces the quality of the associated forecasts of the atmospheric flow. In this article recent improvements through diabatic initialization in the spin-up of large-scale precipitation in the Hirlam NWP model are discussed. In a synthetic example using a puff dispersion model the effect is demonstrated of these improvements on the deposition and dispersion of pollutants with a high scavenging coefficient, such as sulphur, and a low scavenging coefficient, such as cesium- 137. The analysis presented in this article leads to the conclusion that, at least for situations where large-scale precipitation dominates, the improved model has a limited spin-up so that its full forecast range can be used. The implication for dispersion modeling is that the improved model is particularly useful for short-range forecasts and the calculation of local deposition. The sensitivity of the hydrological processes to proper initialization implies that the spin-up problem may reoccur with changes in the model and increased model resolution. Spin-up should be an ongoing concern for <b>atmospheric</b> <b>modelers...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceIt is {{well known}} that the water-vapor {{continuum}} {{plays an important role in}} the radiative balance in the Earth's atmosphere. This was first discovered by Elsasser almost 70 years ago, and since that time there has been a large body of work, both experimental and theoretical, on this topic. It has been experimentally shown that for ambient atmospheric conditions, the continuum absorption scales quadratically with the H 2 O number density and has a strong, negative temperature dependence T dependence. Over the years, there have been three different theoretical mechanisms postulated: Far wings of allowed transitions, water dimers, and collision-induced absorption. Despite the improvements in experimental data, at present there is no consensus on which mechanism is primarily responsible for the absorption. The first mechanism proposed was the accumulation of the far-wing absorption of the strong allowed transitions. Later, absorption by water dimers was proposed and this mechanism provides a qualitative explanation for the strong, negative T dependence. Recently, some <b>atmospheric</b> <b>modelers</b> have proposed that collision-induced absorption is one of the major contributors. However, based on improvements in the theoretical calculation of accurate far-wing line shapes, ab initio dimer calculations, and theoretical collision-induced absorptions, it is now generally accepted that the dominant mechanism for the absorption in the infrared IR windows is that due to the far wings. Whether this is true for other spectral regions is not presently established. Although all these three mechanisms have a negative T dependence, their T dependences will be characterized by individual features. To analyze the characteristics of the latter will enable one to assess their roles with more certainty. In this paper, we present a detailed study of the T dependence of the far-wing absorption mechanism. We will then compare our theoretical calculations with the most recent and accurate experimental data in the IR windows. The results of our calculations are found to agree very well with measurements in the 800 ­ 1200 cm- 1 region. We conclude from this work that the T dependence in the IR window region predicted by the far-wing theory is negative and moderately strong. Its pattern is not simple and it could vary significantly as the frequency of interest varies...|$|R

40|$|Scientific {{measurements}} of atmospheric properties {{have been made}} by a wide variety of planetary flyby missions, orbiters, and landers. Although landers can make in-situ observations of near-surface atmospheric conditions (and can collect atmospheric data during their entry phase), the vast majority of data on planetary atmospheres has been collected by remote sensing techniques from flyby and orbiter spacecraft (and to some extent by Earth-based remote sensing). Many of these remote sensing observations (made over a variety of spectral ranges), consist of vertical profiles of atmospheric temperature as a function of atmospheric pressure level. While these measurements are of great interest to <b>atmospheric</b> scientists and <b>modelers</b> of planetary atmospheres, the primary interest for engineers designing entry descent and landing (EDL) systems is information about atmospheric density as a function of geometric altitude. Fortunately, as described in in this paper, it is possible to use a combination of the gas-law relation and the hydrostatic balance relation to convert temperature-versus-pressure, scientific observations into density-versus-altitude data for use in engineering applications. The following section provides a brief introduction to atmospheric thermodynamics, as well as constituents, and winds for EDL. It also gives methodology for using atmospheric information to do "back-of-the-envelope" calculations of various EDL aeroheating parameters, including peak deceleration rate ("g-load"), peak convective heat rate. and total heat load on EDL spacecraft thermal protection systems.
