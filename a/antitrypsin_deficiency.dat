5|$|Several {{therapeutic}} {{approaches are}} in use or under investigation {{to treat the}} most common serpinopathy: <b>antitrypsin</b> <b>deficiency.</b> Antitrypsin augmentation therapy is approved for severe antitrypsin deficiency-related pulmonary emphysema. In this therapy, antitrypsin is purified from the plasma of blood donors and administered intravenously (first marketed as Prolastin). To treat severe antitrypsin deficiency-related disease, lung and liver transplantation has proven effective. In animal models, gene targeting in {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} has been successfully used to correct an antitrypsin polymerisation defect and to restore the ability of the mammalian liver to secrete active antitrypsin. Small molecules have also been developed that block antitrypsin polymerisation in vitro.|$|E
5|$|Each monomer of the serpin {{aggregate}} {{exists in}} the inactive, relaxed conformation (with the RCL inserted into the A-sheet). The polymers are therefore hyperstable to temperature and unable to inhibit proteases. Serpinopathies therefore cause pathologies similarly to other proteopathies (e.g. prion diseases) via two main mechanisms. First, the lack of active serpin results in uncontrolled protease activity and tissue destruction. Second, the hyperstable polymers themselves clog up the endoplasmic reticulum of cells that synthesize serpins, eventually resulting in cell death and tissue damage. In the case of <b>antitrypsin</b> <b>deficiency,</b> antitrypsin polymers cause the death of liver cells, sometimes resulting in liver damage and cirrhosis. Within the cell, serpin polymers are slowly removed via degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, {{the details of how}} serpin polymers cause cell death remains to be fully understood.|$|E

40|$|Cutaneous Hodgkin {{lymphoma}} {{is a rare}} condition. Specific neoplastic involvement can be primary (confined to the skin) {{or secondary}} to systemic involvement (metastatic).

40|$|Genetic or environmentally-induced {{alterations}} in protein structure {{interfere with the}} correct folding, assembly and trafficking of proteins. In the lung the expression of misfolded proteins can induce a variety of pathogenetic effects. Cystic fibrosis (CF) and alpha- 1 <b>antitrypsin</b> (AAT) <b>deficiency</b> are two major clinically relevant pulmonary disorders associated with protein misfolding. Both are genetic diseases the primary causes of which are expression of mutant alleles of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and SERPINA 1, respectively. The most common and best studied mutant forms of CFTR and AAT are ΔF 508 CFTR and the Glu 342 Lys mutant of AAT called ZAAT, respectively. Non-genetic mechanisms can also damage protein structure and induce protein misfolding in the lung. Cigarette-smoke contains oxidants and other factors that can modify a protein's structure, {{and is one of}} the most significant environmental causes of protein damage within the lung. Herein we describe the mechanisms controlling the folding of wild type and mutant versions of CFTR and AAT proteins, and explore the consequences of cigarette-smoke-induced effects on the protein folding machinery in the lung...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: As {{a common}} {{monogenic}} disease, alpha- 1 <b>antitrypsin</b> (AAT) <b>deficiency</b> has undergone thorough investigation {{for the development}} of gene therapy. The most common pathology associated with AAT deficiency occurs in the lung, where the loss of function due to impaired secretion of mutant AAT prevents the inhibition of neutrophil elastase and leads to loss of elastin content from the alveolar interstitium. AREAS COVERED: Current treatment in the USA consists of recurrent intravenous protein replacement therapy to augment serum AAT levels. In an attempt to replace recurring treatments with a single dose of gene therapy, recombinant adenovirus, plasmid, and recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors have been investigated as vectors for transgene delivery. EXPERT OPINION: Large strides in gene therapy for AAT deficiency lung disease have {{led to the development of}} rAAV 1 -AAT capable of producing sustained serum AAT levels in clinical trials after intramuscular administration in humans at 3 % of the target level. Further increases in levels are anticipated as limb perfusion targets greater muscle mass. The future roles of intrapleural and airway delivery, miRNA-expressing vectors, iPS cell platforms, and genome editing are anticipated...|$|R
40|$|Alpha- 1 <b>antitrypsin</b> (AAT) <b>deficiency</b> is {{a common}} {{monogenic}} disorder resulting in emphysema, which is currently treated with weekly infusions of protein replacement. We previously reported achieving plasma wild-type (M) AAT concentrations at 2. 5 - 3. 8 % of the therapeutic level at 1 year after intramuscular (IM) administration of 6 × 1012 vg/kg of a recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (rAAV 1) -AAT vector in AAT-deficient patients, with an associated regulatory T cell (Treg) response to AAV 1 capsid epitopes {{in the absence of}} any exogenous immune suppression. Here, we report sustained expression at greater than 2 % of the therapeutic level for 5 years after one-time treatment with rAAV 1 -AAT in an AAT-deficient patient from that study, with partial correction of neutrophil defects previously reported in AAT-deficient patients. There was also evidence of an active Treg response (FoxP 3 +, Helios+) and an exhausted cytotoxic T cell response (PD- 1 +, LAG- 3 +) to AAV 1 capsid. These findings suggest that muscle-based AAT gene replacement is toleragenic and that very stable levels of M AAT may exert beneficial effects at lower concentrations than previously anticipated...|$|R

There were no changes in hematology or clinical chemistry parameters. M-specific AAT was expressed above background in all subjects in cohorts 2 and 3 and was sustained at levels 0. 1 % of normal for at least 1 year in the highest dosage level cohort, despite development of neutralizing antibody and IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunospot responses to AAV 1 capsid at day 14 in all subjects.
