5|$|Najm-ul-Hassan {{was also}} Devika's co-star in the studio's next venture, Jeevan Naiya. The two co-stars {{developed}} a romantic relationship, {{and during the}} shooting schedule of Jeevan Naiya, Devika eloped with Hassan. Himanshu was both enraged and distraught. Since the leading pair were absent, production was stalled. A {{significant portion of the}} movie had been shot and a large sum of money, which had been taken as credit from financers, had been spent. The studio therefore suffered severe financial losses <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> credit among bankers in the city while the runaway couple made merry.|$|E
5|$|On 23 September 2010, an {{incident}} occurred in Queen Mary 2s aft harmonic filter room. This {{resulted in the}} shutdown of all four propulsion motors <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> electrical power throughout the ship. Within an hour, the ship's main generators were restarted and {{it was able to}} resume passage. The later investigations finding revealed that an explosion was caused by electrical arcing within the aft harmonic filter igniting leaked dielectric fluid vapour.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{construction}} of the Canning Dam, among other drinking water supply dams, water flow into the Canning River has been reduced by up to 96%. A number of freshwater fish species which are endemic to the south-west of Western Australia are found in the Canning River system, however studies of fish and fish habitats in the area have shown that fish numbers are low due to a loss of habitat <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> linkage between breeding areas due to low flows, preventing fish migrating upstream and reaching important breeding and nursery grounds. Stagnant water caused by a lack of water flow has provided a suitable habitat for successful breeding of an introduced pest, the mosquitofish.|$|E

5|$|The {{commission}} also projected {{an impact}} {{on the future of the}} community; 22,000 people were projected to leave the region with 9,900 direct and indirect jobs affected, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> over $92 million of regional income. This was in contrast to a regional population of over 49,100, available jobs of 33,320, and an annual income of $755 million. The net savings by the end of 1997 from closing the base was $182 million, or about $61.8 million annually.|$|E
5|$|The local Biodiversity Action Plan {{recommends}} {{land management}} measures {{to control the}} spread of ragwort and bracken and identifies four non-native, invasive species as threatening native biodiversity: Japanese knotweed, rhododendron, New Zealand flatworm and mink. It also identifies problems of over-grazing resulting in the impoverishment of moorland and upland habitats <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> native woodland, caused by {{the large numbers of}} red deer and sheep.|$|E
5|$|By the 1880s {{there was}} {{increasing}} pressure {{to reform the}} structure of English counties {{and the question of}} county government had become a major political issue. Both the Liberal and Conservative party manifestos for the 1886 general election contained promises to introduce elected local authorities. The Local Government (Boundaries) Act 1887 received Royal Assent in September 1887 and appointed Boundary Commissioners to review the existing county boundaries, except for the 'Counties Corporate'. Worcestershire would have witnessed the formation of a county administration <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> territory to Birmingham. The Act also legislated for Dudley to unite {{with the rest of the}} county, although this would be achieved through a transfer of territory from Staffordshire. This Act was repealed in favour of the alternative Local Government Act 1888.|$|E

5|$|In {{the sixteenth}} century, Scottish kings, {{particularly}} James V, built palaces in a Renaissance style, beginning at Linlithgow. The trend soon spread {{to members of}} the aristocracy. Painting was strongly influenced by Flemish art, with works commissioned from the continent and Flemings serving as court artists. While church art suffered iconoclasm <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> patronage {{as a result of the}} Reformation, house decoration and portraiture became significant for the wealthy, with George Jamesone emerging as the first major named artist in the early seventeenth century. Music also incorporated wider European influences although the Reformation caused a move from complex polyphonic church music to the simpler singing of metrical psalms. Combined with the Union of Crowns in 1603, the Reformation also removed the church and the court as sources of patronage, changing the direction of artistic creation and limiting its scope. In the early seventeenth century the major elements of the Renaissance began to give way to Stoicism, Mannerism and the Baroque.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund, {{supported}} by Zamoyski {{and the former}} king's wife, Anna Jagiellon, was elected King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth on 19 August 1587 and recognized as such by the interrex, the Primate Karnkowski. The election was disputed, however, by Maximilian and opponents of Sigismund chose not to respect the election outcome, decreeing that Maximilian was the rightful monarch three days later on 22 August. The Zborowski family called for the rokosz (legitimate right to rebel) and the election ended in chaos, with several killed and many wounded. For both Zamoyski and the Zborowski family, losing was not an option, as they knew the losing side would likely pay a severe price, from confiscations <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> prestige to a possible death sentence for treason.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian {{constitution}} of 1988 {{called for a}} general vote on {{the restoration of the}} monarchy, which was held in 1993. The royalists went to the polls divided, with the press indicating there were actually two princes aspiring to the Brazilian throne (Dom Luiz de Orleans e Bragança and Dom João Henrique); this created some confusion among the voters. Voting tickets further divided the electorate by placing one box for a presidential republic on the ballot and four for a monarchy. Additional anti-monarchial sentiment was generated by several aggressive television commercials claiming that a vote for monarchy would be a vote for the return of slavery for blacks <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> Brazil's recent return to democracy after decades of military dictatorship. This result was a loss for the monarchists at the polls.|$|E

5|$|The Panic of 1907 – {{also known}} as the 1907 Bankers' Panic or Knickerbocker Crisis – was a United States {{financial}} crisis that took place over a three-week period starting in mid-October, when the New York Stock Exchange fell almost 50% from its peak the previous year. Panic occurred, as this was during a time of economic recession, and there were numerous runs on banks and trust companies. The 1907 panic eventually spread throughout the nation when many state and local banks and businesses entered bankruptcy. Primary causes of the run included a retraction of market liquidity by a number of New York City banks <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> confidence among depositors, exacerbated by unregulated side bets at bucket shops.|$|E

Androgen deprivation leads to slower metabolism <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> muscle tone. Building muscle takes more work. The addition of a progestogen may increase energy, although it may increase appetite as well.|$|E
25|$|His {{warnings}} of impending economic crisis <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> {{confidence in the}} dollar in 2005 and 2006 were at the time derided by many economists, but accelerating dollar devaluation in 2007 led experts like former Federal Reserve chair Alan Greenspan to reconsider hard money policies {{such as those of}} Paul.|$|E

25|$|Medical {{literature}} states, {{and studies}} show, that punishing or shaming {{a child for}} bedwetting will frequently make the situation worse. Doctors describe a downward cycle where a child punished for bedwetting feels shame <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> self-confidence. This can cause increased bedwetting incidents, leading to more punishment and shaming.|$|E
25|$|Earthquakes {{can cause}} fires by {{damaging}} electrical power or gas lines. In {{the event of}} water mains rupturing <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> pressure, it may also become difficult {{to stop the spread}} of a fire once it has started. For example, more deaths in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake were caused by fire than by the earthquake itself.|$|E
25|$|The airline {{took the}} name Busy Bee of Norway A/S in 1980, {{at which time}} it also took {{delivery}} of a Boeing 737-200C. Regional services were introduced with Scandinavian Airlines Systems (SAS), followed by Fokker 50s entering service from 1988. Reduced military charters <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> a vital contract in 1991 caused the foundation {{to fall out of}} the airline and it filed for bankruptcy in December 1992. Key people and assets reestablished the airline as Norwegian Air Shuttle.|$|E
