25|$|Characters from fiction {{also seem}} to {{influence}} naming. After the name Kayla was used for a character on the American soap opera Days of Our Lives, the name's popularity increased greatly. The name Tammy, and the related Tamara became popular <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> Tammy and the Bachelor came out in 1957. Some names were established or spread by being used in literature. Notable examples include Pamela, invented by Sir Philip Sidney for a pivotal character in his epic prose work, The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia; Jessica, created by William Shakespeare in his play The Merchant of Venice; Vanessa, created by Jonathan Swift; Fiona, a character from James Macpherson's spurious cycle of Ossian poems; Wendy, an obscure name popularised by J. M. Barrie in his play Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up; and Madison, a character from the movie Splash. Lara and Larissa were rare in America before the appearance of Doctor Zhivago, and have become fairly common since.|$|E
25|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> {{as seen in}} , Cobra Commander {{is still}} in his snake form and kept as a pet by Serpentor. However, Baroness restores him partly to a semi-human form—through {{exposure}} to an ancient primordial energy called Dragonfire, which {{is the focal point}} of the first five episodes of the new series. The basic shape of his body is humanoid, his skin and features are reptilian and he retains a taste for flies that he catches with his prehensile tongue. His intellect is fully restored, and upon being outfitted with his battle armor, Cobra Commander once again appears to be a humanoid male. He regains control of Cobra, and even dispatches Serpentor, using the new found Dragonfire energy to turn him into an oversize iguana. Cobra Commander's inhuman origins are never mentioned again, and he is never shown to have reptilian features again. In Season 2, he resumes wearing his original cloth mask, and his eyes appear to be completely human.|$|E

500|$|In 2010 Entertainment Weekly {{reported}} a planned spin-off television series, 2013, {{which would have}} been a sequel to the film. 2012 executive producer Mark Gordon told the magazine, [...] "ABC will have an opening in their disaster-related programming after Lost ends, so people would be interested in this topic on a weekly basis. There's hope for the world despite the magnitude of the 2012 disaster as seen in the film. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> {{there are some people who}} survive, and the question is how will these survivors build a new world and what will it look like. That might make an interesting TV series." [...] However, plans were later canceled for budgetary reasons. It would have been Emmerich's third film to spawn a spin-off; the first was Stargate (followed by Stargate SG-1, Stargate Infinity, Stargate Atlantis, Stargate Universe), and the second was Godzilla (followed by the animated [...] ).|$|E

I've had many, many offers to turn it into musicals, into TV or stage plays, but I've always refused. That film was a work of art." [...] Peck met Lee's father, the model for Atticus, before the filming. Lee's father died before the film's release, and Lee was so {{impressed}} with Peck's performance that she gave him her father's pocketwatch, which he had with him the evening he was awarded the Oscar for Best Actor. Years later, he was reluctant to tell Lee that the watch was stolen out of his luggage in London Heathrow Airport. When Peck eventually did tell Lee, he said she responded, [...] "'Well, it's only a watch.' Harper—she feels deeply, but she's not a sentimental person about things." [...] Lee and Peck shared a friendship long <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> was made. Peck's grandson was named [...] "Harper" [...] in her honor.|$|E

[...] In his review for The Washington Post, Hal Hinson wrote, [...] "Ultimately, The Usual Suspects may be too clever for its own good.

500|$|The writers {{worked to}} keep the script's pop-culture {{references}} up-to-date over the years of development. Kinberg confirmed that the film would make fun of Deadpool's portrayal in X-Men Origins: Wolverine. It also makes jokes at that expense of Green Lantern. While Miller {{felt that it was}} okay for audience members to not understand all of the jokes in the film, he wanted to avoid things specifically targeted to comic fans, saying that [...] "any joke that an audience needs to look up on the internet <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> is not something I’m in favour of." [...] The film's post-credits scene is a parody of the equivalent scene from Ferris Bueller's Day Off, where the title character breaks the fourth wall like Deadpool. In the scene, Deadpool wears a bath robe and tells the audience to go home. He also confirms that Cable will appear in the sequel. After reading the scene, a Fox executive described the film as [...] "Ferris Bueller's Day Off meets Natural Born Killers", which the writers felt was an accurate description.|$|E

Club argues in an online debate over this issue that [...] "The Simpsons has come to rely too much on wacky Homer shtick and tired, meaningless guest stars" [...] and that the writers are [...] "content to amuse themselves with in-jokes, non sequiturs, and self-consciously silly plot twists." [...] Jean responded to this criticism by saying: [...] "Well, it's possible that we've declined. But honestly, I've been here the whole time and I do remember in season two people saying, 'It's gone downhill.' If we'd listened to that then we would have stopped after episode 13.
