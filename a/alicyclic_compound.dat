40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006 Research in {{the field}} of {{dendrimer}} chemistry has escalated in the past two decades. Dendrimers are macromolecules closely related to polymers but with a much smaller mass distribution. Because of this property, they possess unique three dimensional characteristics. Dendrimers are increasingly used in homogeneous catalysis due to the ease of separation from the reaction mixture with the use of nanofiltration membranes. Dendritic catalysts are limited to lower generation dendrimers, which unfortunately aren't large and robust enough to be constrained by nanofiltralion membranes. The reason is that higher generation dendrimers sterically hinder access to the active point in the catalyst. Incorporation of rigid. three dimensional alicydic compounds in dendrimers holds a possible solution to this problem. Two objectives were set: 1. Suitable alicyclic compounds were to be syntethised and incorporated into the core of a dendrimer. 2. Suitable alicyclic compounds were to be syntethised and used as periphery molecules for a dendrimer. • Alicyclic compounds 16, 23 and 28 were identified as suitable core molecules for alicyclic dendrimers. Compound 8 was identified as a suitable dendron to be coupled lo an <b>alicyclic</b> <b>compound.</b> • Compound 16 is synthesised through reduction of the p-benzoquinone-cyclopentadiene- adduct 3 by sodiumborohydride in a ceriumtrichloride heptahydrate solution in methanol before irradiation by ultraviolet light. • Coupling <b>alicyclic</b> <b>compound</b> 16 with dendron 8, was done in alkaline dimethyl sulfoxide. Only one hydrogen was substituted with a dendron. Removal of the excess compound 8 proved to be problematic and very little of the pure product could be obtained. • Compound 23 was synthesised by reducing compound 22, which was synthesised as follows. • Coupling <b>alicyclic</b> <b>compound</b> 23 with dendron 8, was done in alkaline dimethyl sulfoxide. The raw product was a yellow oil and couldn't be separated from the excess compound 8. No analytical data could therefore be obtained. The only conclusion that could be made as {{to the nature of the}} product was based on semi-empirical calculations performed with Accelrys MS Modeling, which indicated that only one hydrogen would most likely have been substituted by compound 8 and probably at the oxygen indicated below. • The third <b>alicyclic</b> <b>compound</b> synthesised was 28, for which the starting compound is synthesised as follows. • Clemmensen reduction yields a mixture of products of which 28 is the main product. 27 could be separated by steam distillation, after which 28 could be retrieved from the remaining water. • Coupling <b>alicyclic</b> <b>compound</b> 28 with dendron 8, was done in alkaline dimethyl sulfoxide. Compound 32 could be separated from the excess dendron 8 as a colourless crystalline product by flash chromatography using petroleum ether:ethyl acetate:methanol (20 : 20 : 1) as eluent. Substitution again only took place at one oxygen. • A possible explanation for the single substitution of dendmn 8 on the alicyclic compounds, could be gained from molecular modelling data performed with Accelrys MS Modeling. The moment one aromatic substituent is present in an alicyclic structure, all the HOMO electrons move from the remaining hydroxyl group to the aromatic substituent, leaving no electrons available for nucleophilic attack on another molecule of 8. See example below. • Compound 38 was identified and synthesised as a suitable alicyclic structure for incorporation in the periphery of a dendrimer. • Compound 41 was used as the aromatic core molecule. Both benzylic bromide positions was substituted by molecules of 38, thus obtaining an alicyclic dendrimer 42 with two alicyclic compounds on the periphery. • Compounds 32 and 42 were successfully synthesised as alicyclic dendrimers.

40|$|The {{thiamine}} diphosphate (ThDP) dependent flavoenzyme cyclohexane- 1, 2 - dione hydrolase (CDH) (EC 3. 7. 1. 11) catalyses a key step {{of a novel}} anaerobic degradation pathway for alicyclic alcohols by converting cyclohexane- 1, 2 -dione (CDO) to 6 -oxohexanoate and further to adipate using NAD + as electron acceptor. To gain insights into the molecular basis of these reactions CDH from denitrifying anaerobe Azoarcus sp. strain 22 Lin was structurally characterized at 1. 26 Å resolution. Notably, the active site funnel is rearranged in an unprecedented manner providing the structural basis for the specific binding and cleavage of an <b>alicyclic</b> <b>compound.</b> Crucial features include a decreased and displaced funnel entrance, a semicircularly shaped loop segment preceding the C-terminal arm and the attachment of the C-terminal arm to other subunits of the CDH tetramer. Its structural scaffold and the ThDP activation is related to that observed for {{other members of the}} ThDP enzyme family. The selective binding of the competitive inhibitor 2 -methyl- 2, 4 -pentane-diol (MPD) to the open funnel of CDH reveals an asymmetry of the two active sites found also in the dimer of several other ThDP dependent enzymes. The substrate binding site is characterized by polar and non-polar moieties reflected in the structures of MPD and CDO and by three prominent histidine residues (His 28, His 31 and His 76) that most probably {{play a crucial role in}} substrate activation. The NAD + dependent oxidation of 6 -oxohexanoate remains enigmatic as the redox-active cofactor FAD seems not to participate in catalysis, and no obvious NAD + binding site is found.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Coupling {{homogeneous}} catalysts to dendrimers with rigid nuclei is {{one possible}} strategy to recycle these compounds {{in an industrial}} environment. During this study {{attempts were made to}} attach the well-defined ruthenium carbene complex 2 to the <b>alicyclic</b> <b>compound</b> 1 A. To achieve this goal attempts were made to functionalise 1 A with anime groups to facilitate the attachment of phosphine groups. The catalyst 2 would then be attached through a phosphine exchange reaction. Oximes were used as precursors in attempts to prepare cage amines from 1 A. For this purpose, the dioxime 28 was prepared from 1 A. Reduction of 28 was unsuccessful. Molecular modelling showed that the lobes of the LUMOs of the oxime carbon atoms of 28 do not protrude from the total electron density of this molecule. This observation indicates that 28 would probably not react with nucleophiles, such as the hydride ion. Molecular modelling was used to probe the unreactive nature of oxime 28. The probe revealed that the imide ring deactivates the oxime groups in this compound. Based on these results, attempts were made to change the carbon framework of 1 A to eliminate unwanted interaction between the carbonyl groups. Clemmensen reduction of 1 A did not yield the expected ketol 40, but gave a mixture of 62 and 63. Extended reaction times yielded 63 only. Reduction of 1 A with zinc and acetic acid produced a mixture of 62 and 40 that could not be separated. Consequently, the applicability of 62 as a possible dendrimer nucleus was investigated. Compound 62 was obtained by oxidisation of the diol 63 with sodium periodate. Attempts to synthesise the dioxime 69 from 62 failed and only the mono oxime 71 was obtained. Reduction of 71 with lithium aluminium hydride was unsuccessful. Molecular modelling revealed that the oxime carbon atom does not have a LUMO and that the carbonyl carbon atom would probably be unreactive towards nucleophiles. Several other attempts were made at reducing the oxime 71 to an amine. None of these attempts met with any success. The reason for the unreactive nature of 71 is less clear than in the case of 28. Failure to produce a cage amine from 1 A or derivatives of 1 A meant failure in functionalising the cage system with phosphine groups and coupling the Grubbs-I catalyst. It seems that cage compounds based on 1 A are generally not suitable as starting materials for amine-functionalised dendrimer nuclei. Master...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cupriavidus necator JMP 134 is a Gram-negative beta-proteobacterium {{able to grow}} on {{a variety}} of {{aromatic}} and chloroaromatic compounds as its sole carbon and energy source. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Its genome consists of four replicons (two chromosomes and two plasmids) containing a total of 6631 protein coding genes. Comparative analysis identified 1910 core genes common to the four genomes compared (C. necator JMP 134, C. necator H 16, C. metallidurans CH 34, R. solanacearum GMI 1000). Although secondary chromosomes found in the Cupriavidus, Ralstonia, and Burkholderia lineages are all derived from plasmids, analyses of the plasmid partition proteins located on those chromosomes indicate that different plasmids gave rise to the secondary chromosomes in each lineage. The C. necator JMP 134 genome contains 300 genes putatively involved in the catabolism of aromatic compounds and encodes most of the central ring-cleavage pathways. This strain also shows additional metabolic capabilities towards <b>alicyclic</b> <b>compounds</b> and the potential for catabolism of almost all proteinogenic amino acids. This remarkable catabolic potential seems to be sustained by a high degree of genetic redundancy, most probably enabling this catabolically versatile bacterium with different levels of metabolic responses and alternative regulation necessary to cope with a challenging environment. From the comparison of Cupriavidus genomes, it is possible to state that a broad metabolic capability is a general trait for Cupriavidus genus, however certain specialization towards a nutritional niche (xenobiotics degradation, chemolithoautotrophy or symbiotic nitrogen fixation) seems to be shaped mostly by the acquisition of "specialized" plasmids.
