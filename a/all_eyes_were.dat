5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the race, <b>all</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> on {{the battle}} for third place, as Häkkinen's pace was so slow that Karl Wendlinger was {{catching}} him in the Sauber, aiming to give Sauber their first podium finish. However, Häkkinen was able to resist Wendlinger's challenge and finish in third place, with Wendlinger fourth. Ukyo Katayama finished fifth for Tyrrell and Hill was able to battle back to finish sixth, the last of the points-scorers.|$|E
25|$|England’s innings {{proceeded}} well {{through the}} morning of day 2, with Ian Bell posting a fluent 83 before chipping a shot to midwicket. However, England then suffered a mini collapse, triggered by Muttiah Muralitharan, and slipped to 185/6 before rain curtailed the day’s play. By this point, <b>all</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> on Muralitharan {{who was on the}} verge of overtaking Shane Warne’s career haul of 708 test wickets.|$|E

25|$|<b>All</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> on Jack Martin for the Round 1 clash against Richmond but a {{shoulder}} injury in the fifth minute of the game ruled the talented teenage out {{for a minimum of}} two months. Despite the injury, the Gold Coast came out victorious against the Tigers by three goals. Mixed results followed as the Gold Coast entered Round 5 with a 2-2 record. The team would then make club history by recording five consecutive victories against Melbourne, Greater Western Sydney, North Melbourne, St Kilda and the Western Bulldogs.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the 2005 English cricket season began, a resurgent English cricket team had won four Test series in a row, going unbeaten through the 2004 calendar year. The start of the international season saw England defeat Bangladesh 2–0 in their two-match series, winning both Tests by an innings. This was followed by a tri-nations one-day tournament that also featured Australia. However, <b>all</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> on the Ashes. Australia still started as favourites, but England, {{for the first time in}} years, were expected to put up a real challenge to Aussie supremacy.|$|E
25|$|Two months later, Woods was {{the only}} player under par at the U.S. Open, and resurrected buzz about the {{calendar}} Grand Slam, which had eluded him in 2000. <b>All</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> on Woods at the Open Championship, but his third round score of 81 in dreadful weather at Muirfield ended his Grand Slam hopes. At the PGA Championship, he nearly repeated his 2000 feat of winning three majors in one year, but bogeys at the 13th and 14th holes {{in the final round}} cost him the championship by one stroke. Nonetheless, he took home the money title, Vardon Trophy, and Player of the Year honors for the fourth year in a row.|$|E

Third-seeded Novak Djoković {{came back from a}} one set deficit to Denis Gremelmayr to make it into the second round. James Blake, David Nalbandian and Nicolás Almagro proceeded to the next round in straight sets, while Andy Murray needed almost three hours to beat French wild card Jonathan Eysseric 6–2, 1–6, 4–6, 6–0, 6–2. 1998 French Open winner Carlos Moyá fell to qualifier Eduardo Schwank and Janko Tipsarević lost to Nicolás Lapentti.|$|E
500|$|A brief {{flash of}} fire was visible {{to most of}} the ships in the convoy, and for several seconds, only smoke could be seen {{billowing}} from her hold. A few seconds later, a huge pillar of fire shot out of Burke's cargo hold, followed by an immense cloud of white smoke. Within seconds <b>all</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> drawn to Burke where an enormous fireball erupted as her entire cargo of munitions detonated, instantly destroying the ship and killing her crew of 40 merchant marine sailors and 28 or 29 armed guards. For several seconds, Burke was not visible under an enormous mushroom cloud of smoke, fire and explosions. Several ships nearby were damaged by the force of the blast and flying fragments. The shock wave rocked the entire convoy, and several ships reported that they had been torpedoed. [...] A US Army [...] "FS" [...] type ship just aft of Burke was severely damaged by the blast, sinking before it could be identified. As the cloud of smoke cleared, nearby ships closed on Burkes former position to search for survivors. [...] It was soon clear that Burke, and all 68 men aboard her, were gone.|$|E
2500|$|In a Dutch {{study by}} Cees van der Windt, MD, and colleagues, 100 eyes, with PVD-related {{floaters}} persisting {{for more than}} nine months, were treated with YAG laser vitreolysis (n=65) or pars plana vitrectomy (n=35). After <b>all</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> treated, both the YAG and vitrectomy groups reported an improvement in vision at 85% and 90% respectively. Furthermore, over a follow-up period of eight years, no complications were observed among YAG-treated patients. These findings support those of two small-scale 1990s studies conducted by Tsai, et al., and Toczolowski, et al.. In both studies, a near 100% rate of floater removal was achieved with [...] vitreolysis, and no intra- or post-operative complications occurred in any patient.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the reign}} of Ahmed III (17031730) and under the impetus of his grand vizier İbrahim Paşa, a period of peace ensued. Due to the close {{relations}} between the Ottoman Empire and France, Ottoman architecture began {{to be influenced by}} the Baroque and Rococo styles that were popular in Europe. Interestingly, a style that was very similar to Baroque was developed by the Seljuk Turks, according to a number of academics. Examples of the creation of this art form can be witnessed in the Divriği Hospital and Mosque, which is a UNESCO world heritage site, {{as well as in the}} Sivas Çifte Minare, Konya İnce Minare museums and many other buildings from the Seljuk period in Anatolia. It is often called the [...] "Seljuk Baroque portal." [...] From here it emerged again in Italy, and later grew in popularity among the Turks during the Ottoman era. Various visitors and envoys were sent to European cities, especially to Paris, to experience the contemporary European customs and life. The decorative elements of the European Baroque and Rococo influenced even the religious Ottoman architecture. On the other hand, Mellin, a French architect, was invited by a sister of Sultan Selim III to Istanbul and depicted the Bosporus shores and the seaside waterfront mansions called yalı. During a thirty-year period known as the Tulip period, <b>all</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> turned to the West, and instead of monumental and classical works, villas and pavilions were built around Istanbul. However, it was about this time when the construction on the Ishak Pasha Palace (16851784) in Eastern Anatolia was going on.|$|E
