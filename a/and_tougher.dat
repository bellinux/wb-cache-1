5|$|On an {{ordinary}} day at Springfield Elementary, Lisa {{attempts to make}} friends with a new girl, Francine (who is much larger <b>and</b> <b>tougher</b> than Lisa), but Francine beats up Lisa severely. Even attempting to share an interest in Malibu Stacy does not work since the doll that Francine has turns out to be Lisa's, which she then ruins. Lisa attempts to hire the school bullies (Nelson, Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney) to protect her, but they decline since girls fight dirtier than boys (and boys tend to be more vulnerable to falling in love). It is up to Lisa to investigate by herself the reason why Francine is targeting her.|$|E
5|$|The race route {{began in}} Perugia and {{traveled}} throughout the southern half of Italy {{for the first}} ten stages.

There were a total of three stages that started outside Italy. Stage 15 ended in the Swiss city Lenzerheide and served as the start for the race's sixteenth stage.

25|$|Peroxide {{crosslinking}} (PE-Xa): The crosslinking of polyethylene using peroxides (e. g. dicumyl or di-tert-butyl peroxide) {{is still}} of major importance. In the so-called Engel process, {{a mixture of}} HDPE and 2 % peroxide is at first mixed at low temperatures in an extruder and then crosslinked at high temperatures (between 200 and 250°C). The peroxide decomposes to peroxide radicals (RO•), which abstract (remove) hydrogen atoms from the polymer chain, leading to radicals. When these combine, a crosslinked network is formed. The resulting polymer network is uniform, of low tension and high flexibility, whereby it is softer <b>and</b> <b>tougher</b> than (the irradiated) PE-Xc.|$|E

A review of his record showed that he took steps to protect the industry from government oversight <b>and</b> <b>tougher</b> rules.

25|$|The SOCATA TBM is a single-engined turboprop-powered low-wing monoplane, {{capable of}} seating {{a maximum of}} seven people. It is {{composed}} mainly of aluminium and steel construction, but with the tail surfaces built of Nomex honeycomb. The wing features a very effective Fowler flap, comprising 80 per cent of the trailing edge's span, {{for the purpose of}} lowering the aircraft's stall speed. The TBM 700 is outfitted with a retractable tricycle landing gear arrangement, newer models feature stronger main landing gear wheels <b>and</b> <b>tougher</b> tyres. The TBM 900 model features automatic torque limiting for “set and forget” power management, which is of particularly use during takeoffs; according to Aviation Week, while this function does reduce the high workload associated with managing the PT6A engine, it is not as capable as a full FADEC arrangement.|$|E
25|$|Edward, {{like all}} vampires in the Twilight series, {{possesses}} superhuman stamina, senses, mentality, and agility, {{as well as}} a healing factor and night vision. His superhuman strength allows him to subdue his prey, uproot trees, throw cars, and crush metal. His bodily tissue is stronger than granite, making him much more durable <b>and</b> <b>tougher</b> than humans as well as contributing slightly to his body weight. He is described as being inhumanly beautiful with refined and perfected features. His scent and voice are enormously seductive to Bella, so much so that he occasionally sends her into a pliant daze entirely by accident. In Twilight, Edward explains that like other vampires, he does not need to breathe, though he chooses to do so out of habit and because it is helpful to smell his environment. He cannot digest regular food, and compares its attractiveness for him to the prospect of eating dirt for a regular person. Like other vampires, Edward is not able to sleep.|$|E

500|$|Founded by Anders Lange in 1973 as an anti-tax protest movement, {{the party}} values {{individual}} freedom strongly, supports market liberalism, and advocates downsizing bureaucracy {{and the public}} sector, while also proposing increased spending of Norway's public Oil Fund to invest in infrastructure, rejecting {{the notion of the}} [...] "budgetary rule". The party also seek a more restrictive immigration policy <b>and</b> <b>tougher</b> integration and law and order measures. In foreign policy it is strongly Atlanticist, and pro-globalization. After being neutral on Norwegian membership in the European Union for many years, the party in 2016 officially adopted a position opposing Norwegian membership. Long-time chairman Carl I. Hagen was from 1978 to 2006 the undisputed leader of the party, and in many ways personally controlled the ideology and direction of the party. The current leader of the party is Siv Jensen, who since 2013 is also Norway's Minister of Finance.|$|E
