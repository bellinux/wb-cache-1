25|$|The Raj re-banned the CPI in 1939, for {{its initial}} anti-War stance. The line was changed when, {{following}} the Nazi-Soviet pact (1939-40). The Communist Party of India {{did not take}} an <b>active</b> <b>stance</b> against Adolf Hitler and his policies. But when Hitler attacked Poland, the Communist Party of India had called World War II, an 'Imperialist War'. But when he attacked the Soviet Union, the same Communist Party of India decided to call the war, a People's War.|$|E
25|$|Gerhard Schröder was re-elected as {{chancellor}} by {{the parliament}} in a coalition with the Greens, who had increased their vote share marginally. Many commentators faulted Stoiber's {{reaction to the}} floods in eastern Germany, {{in the run-up to}} the election, as a contributory factor in his party's poor electoral result and defeat. In addition, Schröder distinguished himself from his opponent by taking an <b>active</b> <b>stance</b> against the upcoming United States-led Iraq War. His extensive campaigning on this stance was widely seen as swinging the election to the SPD in the weeks running up to the election.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s {{the policy of}} Don Javier and Fal Conde, dubbed javierismo or falcondismo, was {{increasingly}} contested within the Comunión. The Sivattistas pressed for terminating the regency and for Don Javier to declare himself the king. They suspected that the overdue regency was an element of Don Javier’s policy towards Franco; according to them, the regent intended to ensure the crown for the Bourbon-Parma by means of appeasement rather than by means of open challenge. In particular they were enraged by allegedly ambiguous stand versus the proposed Francoist , considering it an unacceptable backing of the regime. On the other hand, the possibilists were getting tired of what they perceived as ineffective intransigence and lack of legal outposts, recommending more flexible attitude. Especially following the 1949 news about Franco’s negotiations with Don Juan, Don Javier found himself under pressure to assume a more <b>active</b> <b>stance.</b>|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} ability of the Fiscal Theory of the Price Level to {{determine}} the price level when fiscal regimes are subject to change. I find that the Fiscal Theory cannot provide a globally unique solution among all possibilities when fiscal policy is allowed to transition between passive and <b>active</b> <b>stances.</b> Instead, determinacy is only achieved among the subclass of locally-bounded solution paths. This result is significant because it implies one of the touted advantages of the Fiscal Theory, global determinacy, is a special case that is only applicable when fiscal policy regimes are permanently active...|$|R
50|$|What {{is notable}} about the vase {{is not the}} subject matter, but rather {{the way in which}} it is depicted. Breaking the {{traditionally}} rigid frontal postures of contemporary Archaic statues and paintings, the revelers are in dynamic, overlapping postures. The two outer figures stand in <b>active</b> <b>stances,</b> with their legs and hands in motion. As does the middle figure shown in a standing position, with his front to the viewer and his head is looking down over his left breast, as his hands are busy adjusting his armor. The use of foreshortening, although primitive, gives the entire composition a more natural and believable feel. It is perhaps the use of this relatively untried technique that led Euthymides to write on his vase “As never Euphronios do!” as a taunt to his contemporary and rival.|$|R
25|$|Johan Sørensen {{stated that}} it was {{necessary}} to have advanced tolls for the bridge to be included on the Norwegian Road Plan, but this was denied by the Ministry of Transport. They did, however, state that {{it would be easier to}} finance the bridge with save-up advanced tolls. By 26 April, 5,000 people had signed the petition against advanced toll. This caused the Liberal Party to take an <b>active</b> <b>stance</b> against advanced tolls. By May the petition had 6,300 signatures, equal to more than half of those entitled to vote and two-thirds of the number of people who had voted in the previous municipal election. The issue became the major issue ahead of the election. Both AMF and the toll company sent delegations to Oslo to speak with Minister of Transport and Communications Johan J. Jacobsen. Because of the lack of opposition in the elected bodies, it was expected that the Parliament would pass the advanced tolls; however, Askøy's only parliamentarian, Mons Espelid from the Liberal Party, stated that he was opposed.|$|E

His incredibly genuine connection to his fans has made him more than just a Pop Icon, but a symbol for his people.

2500|$|Though mostly dormant {{in times}} of the dictatorship, during [...] Carlism assumed more <b>active</b> <b>stance.</b> In June 1930 the new Navarrese junta with Rodezno its member was set up, an attempt to enforce more {{cautious}} policy towards Basque nationalism and to shift focus from foral to religious issues. The move might have backfired following declaration of the Republic, as the Carlists decided to forge electoral coalition with PNV; when concluded as “lista católico-fuerista” it enabled Rodezno, elected from Navarre, to resume his parliamentary career in 1931. In the Cortes he was the least-Basque minded among Carlist deputies; he ceased to support the autonomy draft when {{it turned out that}} it would not allow autonomous religious policy and started to toy with the idea of an exclusively Navarrese statute.|$|E

5000|$|Nicolae Cristea ( [...] - February 7, 1902) was an Austro-Hungarian ethnic Romanian Orthodox priest, professor, {{journalist}} and political activist. A protégé of Andrei Șaguna, he studied in Germany {{before returning to}} edit the church's newspaper for nearly two decades, a period during which he also taught at the theological seminary in Sibiu.

50|$|Throughout his career, Egler urged ecologists {{to value}} applied and basic {{research}} equally in ecology. He urged ecologists to study human-stressed areas {{along with the}} pristine habitats they then preferred. He also wanted them to take <b>active</b> <b>stances</b> on environmental issues. When Rachel Carson approached him for help with Silent Spring, however, he had essentially abandoned those efforts in frustration and was no longer calling himself an ecologist. Contact with Carson energized him in his crusade to free his science from the influences of chemical manufacturers. While she was writing her book, he shared much of his experience and expertise with her, contributing long letters with comments and suggestions (Lear, p 400). A consequence was that a passage in Silent Spring having some of Egler’s sarcasm received the most criticism from Ian Baldwin in his famously negative review in Science. Egler rose to defend Carson’s (and his) views {{in a series of}} publications that led to his censure by the Entomological Society of America—and censure of a journal that published his views. That incident helped both to focus and to polarize the issues of professionalism and environmentalism in the science of ecology.|$|R
2500|$|There was no {{substantial}} {{resistance to}} this control. The bourgeois women's associations reasoned, as did many others, that the Nazi government was a vulgar phenomenon {{that would soon}} fade, and that through their participation they could still exert some influence. They thus deluded themselves into believing that they were obtaining an [...] "acceptable arrangement", as they were accustomed to do under a patriarchal system. With respect to the widespread tendency to underestimate the threat that the regime presented, the historian Claudia Koonz highlights the popular proverb of the era: [...] "The soup is never eaten as hot as it is cooked". Women who were the most resolute in their opposition either set their sites on emigration, or, if they took an <b>active</b> <b>stance,</b> risked being arrested and interned, and possibly executed, the same as male opponents of the regime.|$|E

40|$|I {{study the}} long run determinacy {{tradeoff}} - recurrent episodes of passive monetary policy are (in) determinate if their expected duration is long (brief) - when passive pol- icy is at the zero bound. On-going regime change implies qualitatively different shock transmission from the standard New Keynesian model. For U. S. baseline parameter values, I find temporary fiscal stimulus is effective, while adverse supply shocks can be expansionary if the central bank's <b>active</b> policy <b>stance</b> is weak and/or if the liquidity trap's average duration exceeds 3 quarters...|$|R

His program showed similarities with that of Pablo Escobar, who paid for lighting to be installed in local football clubs and also paid for housing for slum-dwellers.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} ways in which four Year One {{children}} engage in the literacy events of their regular and Reading Recovery classrooms. It explores how these children perceived their beginning reading instruction and possible relationships between the children 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions and {{the ways in}} which they ‘did 2 ̆ 7 literacy in each setting. The study draws on research in beginning reading instruction from both a psychological and socio-cultural perspective, as well as research into withdrawal programs for children experiencing difficulty in learning to read and the Reading Recovery program itself. A case study approach was used in this study and data collection methods included videoetaped observations of the children in their two classrooms, interviews and examination of artefacts. Observation data was categorised into two main groups of reading and writing behaviours and literacy related behaviours. Results showed similarities in the children 2 ̆ 7 s reading and writing behaviours across the two settings, with some differences noted in their literacy-related behaviours from one setting to the other. The differences were particularly marked in the children 2 ̆ 7 s dispositions to literacy learning, with two of the children showing a more <b>active</b> learning <b>stance</b> in Reading Recovery than in the classroom setting. These results are interpreted in light of previous research literature on classroom learning, continuities and discontinuities between classroom and withdrawal settings, and the effectiveness of the Reading Recovery program. It is suggested that while the withdrawal reading program may assist children to develop their reading and writing skills it may not necessarily develop in children an <b>active</b> learning <b>stance</b> and a positive disposition for literacy learning. The study points towards the need for both classroom and withdrawal teachers to work collaboratively to carefully monitor the individual reading and writing behaviours, literacy learning behaviours and learning stances of at-risk Year One children...|$|R
