40|$|The effects {{produced}} by annealing Y 2 O 3 nanopowders on their spark plasma sintering (SPS) behavior are systematically investigated in this work. It is {{found that the}} <b>annealed</b> <b>powders</b> display higher sinterability {{with respect to the}} as-received ones. Indeed, the maximum densification level reached from pristine powders is about 97. 5 %, whereas density decreases when further increasing either the sintering temperature or the dwell time. In contrast, the density of SPS products obtained from pretreated powder monotonically increases with temperature and processing time, thus leading to fully dense materials in 30 min at 1050 &# 176;C and 60 MPa. Correspondingly, it is found that the annealing treatment markedly inhibits grain coarsening during SPS. Thus, dense translucent samples with grain size below 100 nm can be attained from <b>annealed</b> <b>powders.</b> On the other hand, white-opaque specimens with significantly coarser microstructures (up to 1 -μm-sized grains) are obtained when pristine powders are directly processed under the same sintering conditions.

40|$|Structural and {{magnetic}} characterization of Mn-Al-C permanent magnets obtained by spark plasma sintering (SPS) is reported. The transformation from the parent-phase to the ferromagnetic τ-phase occurs simultaneously {{with the process}} of sintering.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{annealing}} Mg 2 Ni-based compounds enhances the capacity values for all prepared powders (Fig.  4). The absorption capacities of annealed samples vary with time {{following the same}} shape than unheated compounds. Again, the capacity value rises during the first 25  h and then stabilizes. The influence of the heat-treatment on the capacity values is indicated in Table  2. <b>Annealed</b> <b>powders</b> exhibit nearly the same absorption capacity with an average value of 3.47  ±  0.01  H/f.u. This similarity derives from the formation of comparable Mg 2 Ni microstructures (Fig.  1 c) and morphologies upon heat-treating powders. The increase in the capacity value observed upon <b>annealing</b> <b>powders</b> {{is caused by the}} transformation of the amorphous Mg 2 Ni phase into a highly crystallized one, as evidenced by XRD characterizations (Fig.  1). In the same way, the annealing step promotes further conversion of residual Ni and amorphous Mg into Mg 2 Ni. The latter phase is characterized by an absorption capacity higher than the ones of Ni and Mg. However, experimental capacities of annealed products are still lower than theoretical values (Table  2). Westlake et al. [29] reported that the radius of octahedral sites must be larger than 0.4  Å in order to accommodate hydrogen atoms. In the same way, Switendick et al. [30] demonstrated that tetrahedral sites separated by a distance lower than 2.1  Å are unable to absorb hydrogen. Thus, the catalytic activity of as-prepared Mg 2 Ni samples may be limited by the narrow size of some unoccupied tetrahedral and octahedral sites.|$|R

The amorphous powder cores prepared from pre-annealed powder have better soft magnetic properties compared with unpretreated powder core in the as-cast state. The result shows that the powder after pre-annealing in a magnetic field presents a regular domain structure and the soft magnetic properties of the corresponding powder cores are greatly improved.

The core shows an enhanced effective magnetic permeability of 66 after longitude magnetic field annealing at an applied field of 30 Oe and temperature of 400 degrees C, which is attributed to the relief of internal stress and the variation of atomic structure.

40|$|High {{mechanical}} deformation {{has been}} induced in a Ni-Mn-In metamagnetic {{shape memory alloy}} by means of ball milling. The evolution of both the martensitic transformation and the magnetic properties associated to the microstructural variations has been characterized. The as-milled nanometric particles display an amorphous structure with a frustrated magnetic state compatible with a canonical spin-glass. On heating, an abrupt crystallization process occurs around 500  K leading to a cubic B 2 structure, which, in turn, does not show martensitic transformation. Modified Arrott plots point to competing long- and short-range magnetic couplings in the B 2 structure. On further heating, a relaxation process takes place above 700  K concurrently with a B 2 -L 2 atomic ordering, giving rise to an anomalous two-step thermal expansion. The combined effect of both processes makes possible the subsequent occurrence of a martensitic transformation, which {{takes place at the}} same temperature than in the bulk.

Cross sectional slices of ingots produced by slow directional freezing and slow zone recrystal l iza-tion {{have been investigated}} by x- ray powder photograph techniques, and results are given for the variation of composition with position along ingot and for homogeneity of the slice. <b>Annealed</b> <b>powder</b> samples {{have been used to}} check the previous data for the variation of lattice parameter with com-position. Specimens have also been observed by photomicrograph methods and by use of an electron probe microanalyzer. The x-ray, photomicrograph, and microanalyzer data are compared for various samples with different de-grees of homogeneity. Very little information is so far available on InAs-InSb alloys. It has been shown that single phase solid solution can be obtained at all compositions (1), but compressed powder specimens need to be annealed at temperatures very close to the solidus curve for periods of six months or more before such conditions are ap-proached. Similar annealing of solid samples needs very much longer times. The data obtained by anneal-ing compressed powders gave the variation of lattice parameter with composition and the solidus curve shown in Fig. 1 and 2. The liquidus curve in Fig. 2 was obtained by Shih and Perett i (2) using normal cooling curve methods. Here the {{preparation of}} sam-ples of InAs- InSb alloys in solid form suitable for optical and electrical work is discussed. The investiga-tion of the semiconductor parameters of the alloys is discussed elsewhere (3). Methods of Preparation of Solid Specimens Two methods of preparation have been considered, viz., (a) slow directional freezing, and (b) slow zone recrystall ization of suitable ingots. All of the ingots were produced by melt ing together appropriate amounts of high purity InAs and InSb. Both of the compounds were from zone refined ingots to give good purity and both were n type with approximate carrier concentrations of 2 x 10 ze/cm 3 for InAs and 1. 5 x 1016 / cm 3 for InSb. Preparation by powder anncaling. [...] In the case of both the directionally frozen and the zone recrystal...|$|E
40|$|Al 2 O 3 –TiC {{nanocomposite}} powder {{was successfully}} synthesized by ball milling TiO 2, Al and graphite powders. Effects of cup and ball type, milling time and annealing were investigated. XRD {{was used to}} characterize milled and <b>annealed</b> <b>powders.</b> The morphological and microstructural evolutions were studied by SEM and TEM. Results showed that the formation of this composite begins after 20 h and completes after 35 h of milling with stainless steel cup and balls. In contrast, there is no reaction during milling (up to 80 h) with ZrO 2 cup and balls. Fe and ZrO 2 were the major impurities introduced during milling with stainless steel and ZrO 2 cups, respectively. The Fe impurity was removed by leaching in 3 HCl·HNO 3 solution for 4 days. Mean grain size less than 7 nm was achieved {{at the end of}} milling. In spite of grain growth, this composite maintained its nanocrystalline nature after annealing at 1000 °C...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{investigations}} of the ordering, microstructure and magnetomechanical properties of the Fe 80 Ga 20 alloy and its composites are presented. The composites consisted of the Fe-Ga particles with a size distribution in the range between 20 to 50 μm. These particles were produced by blade milling of arc-melted alloy. After milling the <b>powders</b> were <b>annealed</b> at 723 K for 2. 5, 7. 5 and 12. 5 hours. The epoxy-bonded composites in rectangular shape were made from the as-cast {{as well as from}} the <b>annealed</b> <b>powders.</b> Mössbauer spectroscopy studies revealed that the as-cast alloy is completely disordered. After annealing at 723 K the long range atomic order appeared. It was stated that the best magnetoelastic properties were exhibited by composites made from ferromagnetic particles obtained from the as-cast alloy. The measured saturation magnetostriction was λs= 70 x 10 - 6 for the bulk alloy and λs= 100 x 10 - 6 for composite...|$|R
