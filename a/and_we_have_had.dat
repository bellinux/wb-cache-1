40|$|Halloysite {{nanotube}} (HNT) is {{an emerging}} biocompatible material with appealing perspective for technological applications, {{such as in}} catalysis 1 and in pharmaceutical research. 2 Halloysite is a double-layered aluminosilicate mineral that <b>has</b> a predominantly hollow tubular structure. The functionalization of HNTs is a good strategy to introduce an organic moiety onto the external surface and, therefore, to obtain innovative catalyst supports. 3 <b>We</b> <b>have</b> modified the external surface of halloysite nanotube with octylimidazolium moieties (HNT-IL) by microwave irradiation in solvent-free conditions <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>have</b> employed this material as support catalyst of Pd nanoparticles. The new HNT/Pd catalyst was used as catalyst in the Suzuki reaction under microwave irradiation. A set of solvents, times and bases was screened and the best experimental conditions were obtained when the reactions were carried out for 10 minutes in water/ethanol at 120 °C in presence of K 2 CO 3 as base. Good recyclability was observed. The new catalytic system was employed both in 1 mol...|$|R

The underlying goal {{of our work}} is to allow end–users to control and program their environments in a uniform, application–independent way. The heterogeneity of environments, users and programming skills, {{as well as the}} coexistence of different users and domains of automation in the same environment are some of the main challenges analyzed. For doing so, we present our system and describe some of the real–environments, user studies <b>and</b> experiences <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> in the development process...|$|R
