5|$|According to Peter Freuchen, {{the scene}} in which the wolf attacks Mala is real. Freuchen says that Mala, armed with {{a rock and a}} pistol beneath his fur jacket, spent three afternoons trying to lure a wolf into attacking him. A rifleman and a cinematographer using a camera with a {{telephoto}} lens followed at a distance. The wolf attack was filmed from far <b>away,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rifleman ready to shoot the wolf in case Mala was unable to kill it. As shown in film, Mala was able to kill the wolf without using his pistol or relying on the rifleman, and was not injured in the attack.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Marge {{take the}} lizards to the Springfield Birdwatching Society. Principal Skinner, {{a member of}} the society, {{explains}} that they are Bolivian tree lizards, a type of lizard that steals a bird’s eggs and leaves their own eggs to be watched after by the mother bird, which is then eaten by the offspring once they hatch. Skinner says the lizards must be killed by law, because they have killed many bird species. Bart escapes and runs <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lizards, but before he can get away, Skinner catches up to him and they both struggle on top of the building. Suddenly, the lizards glide to the ground, where they start to eradicate pigeons in Springfield.|$|E

5|$|Cecil B. DeMille {{released}} This Day and Age in 1933, and {{it stands}} {{in stark contrast}} to his other films of the period. Filmed shortly after DeMille had completed a five-month tour of the Soviet Union, This Day and Age takes place in America and features several children torturing a gangster who got <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> murder of a popular local shopkeeper. The youngsters are seen lowering the gangster into a vat of rats when the police arrive, and their response is to encourage the youths to continue this. The film ends with the youngsters taking the gangster to a local judge and forcing the magistrate to conduct a trial in which the outcome is never in doubt.|$|E

5|$|Having {{resigned}} most {{of their}} free agents, the club wouldn't see much change in the 2012 off-season, {{with the exception of}} losing unrestricted free agents Peter Mueller, Jay McClement and Kevin Porter. Colorado would add Greg Zanon, John Mitchell and high scoring winger P. A. Parenteau to its roster. Gabriel Landeskog, the Avs' lone representative at the 2012 NHL Awards, walked <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Calder Memorial Trophy, joining Chris Drury, Peter Forsberg and Peter Stastny for earning top rookie honors for the Avalanche.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Bart {{continue}} to give Lisa {{a hard time}} at home, particularly since Homer is ready to host a barbecue, complete with roast pig.

Enraged and deeply hurt, she climbs aboard a riding mower and drives <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> roast pig in tow. Homer and Bart chase her, but she pushes the pig off a slope and they are too late. The pig rolls through bushes, into a river, and is shot into the air by a dam spillway's suction.|$|E
5|$|Influenced by Wise, the {{congregation}} implemented many reforms in its services. In 1861 they adopted Wise's Minhag America prayer book. In that same decade they added an organ, did <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> prayer shawl, {{and started a}} religious school. In the 1870s {{the congregation}} removed yahrzeit candles from the sanctuary, and added family pews and a mixed choir (men and women together). In 1873 B'nai Yeshurun {{was one of the}} first thirteen founding members of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (UAHC), now Union for Reform Judaism.|$|E

5|$|On Saturday, October 6, {{the grand}} jury heard {{testimony}} from Joseph Langdon, {{the crew of the}} Lucinda, and a carman from Brooklyn.

Voorhees was joined by lawyer Isaac R. Wilson, of New York City, for Jackalow's defense. Jackalow pleaded not guilty to each count. On the motion of U.S. Attorney Cannon, a special term of the circuit court was appointed to meet in Trenton, on the third Tuesday in January, to try the case.|$|E
5|$|The {{value of}} {{treasure}} Morgan collected during his expedition is disputed. Talty {{writes that the}} figures range from 140,000 to 400,000 pesos, and that owing to the large army Morgan assembled, the prize-per-man was relatively low, causing discontent. There were accusations, particularly in Exquemelin's memoirs, that Morgan left <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> majority of the plunder. He arrived back in Port Royal on 12 March to a positive welcome from the town's inhabitants. The following month he made his official report to the governing Council of Jamaica, and received their formal thanks and congratulations.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} debates {{about whether the}} {{original}} gene duplication events occurred in a salivary gland or in body tissues themselves. The prevailing idea for many years is the birth-and-death model described above, in which genes in other body tissues are duplicated and then recruited to the venom gland before natural selection for toxicity. However, in 2014 a new model {{was proposed in which}} salivary protein genes are duplicated and then restricted to the venom gland. This model does <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> recruitment hypothesis and cites the homology between certain venom and body genes as unrelated in the linear fashion described in the traditional birth-and-death model.|$|E

5|$|This work {{maintains}} a heavy {{importance in the}} Art History world, as {{it is widely believed}} to be the first painting, since the fall of Rome (ca. 476 AD), to use Scientific Linear One Point Perspective, or, all the orthogonals point to one vanishing point, in this case, Christ. Also, it is one of the first paintings that does <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> use of a head-cluster. A technique employed by earlier Proto-Renaissance artists, such as Giotto or Duccio. If you were to walk into the painting, you could walk around Jesus Christ, in the semicircle created, and back out the painting again with ease.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{exterior}} shots were always filmed {{on location in}} Holmfirth and the surrounding countryside, the interior shots were, until the early 1990s, filmed {{in front of a}} live studio audience at BBC Television Centre in London. The amount of location work increased, however, as studio work became a drain on time and money. Under Alan J. W. Bell, Last of the Summer Wine became the first comedy series to do <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> live studio audience, moving all of the filming to Holmfirth. The episodes were filmed and then shown to preview audiences, whose laughter was recorded and then mixed into each episode's soundtrack to provide a laugh track and avoid the use of canned laughter.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Middle Ages, the {{functions}} and composition of households started to change. This was due primarily to two factors. First of all, the introduction of gunpowder to the field of warfare rendered the castle a less effective defence, and did <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> military function of the household. The result was a household more focused on comfort and luxury, and with a significantly larger proportion of women.|$|E

5|$|Trying {{to come up}} with {{a better}} way to {{generate}} alternating current, Tesla developed a steam powered reciprocating electricity generator. He patented it in 1893 and introduced it at the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition that year. Steam would be forced into the oscillator and rush out through a series of ports, pushing a piston up and down that was attached to an armature. The magnetic armature vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating magnetic field. This induced alternating electric current in the wire coils located adjacent. It did <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> complicated parts of a steam engine/generator, but never caught on as a feasible engineering solution to generate electricity.|$|E

Wyatt, who did not believe in divorce, refused. She ran <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> gambler anyway, and he later {{abandoned}} her in Arizona.|$|E
5|$|A {{few weeks}} after Morris {{announced}} his departure from the team, Martin announced that David Nedohin, the fourth player on his former provincial rival Randy Ferbey's team, would join Martin's team. Martin and team won their first event of the season at the Shoot-Out.

Jeff Sharp subbed in at lead, and Martin's team finished the event as runners-up to Jeff Stoughton. After winning {{the final of the}} Direct Horizontal Drilling Fall Classic over Brock Virtue and posting a semifinals finish at the Cactus Pheasant Classic, Martin played in the Masters Grand Slam, finishing the round robin with a 3–1 win-loss record.
