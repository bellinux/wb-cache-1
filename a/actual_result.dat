5|$|On 15 April 1941, Galland {{took off}} with lobster and {{champagne}} to celebrate General Theo Osterkamp's birthday at Le Touquet, France. He made a detour with his wingman towards England, looking for RAF aircraft. Off the cliffs of Dover, he spotted a group of Spitfires. Galland attacked and claimed two confirmed and one unconfirmed shot down. The <b>actual</b> <b>result</b> was the destruction of one Spitfire; {{the other two were}} damaged in force landings with both pilots wounded. During the combat, Galland's undercarriage had dropped causing one of the RAF pilots (Flight Lieutenant Paddy Finucane) to claim Galland's aircraft as destroyed, but Galland landed without incident at Le Touquet and presented Osterkamp with his gifts. Galland's success that day represented his 60th and 61st aerial victory.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{the general}} method {{to compute the}} inverse square root was to {{calculate}} an approximation for , then revise that approximation via another method until it came within an acceptable error range of the <b>actual</b> <b>result.</b> Common software methods in the early 1990s drew approximations from a lookup table. The key of the fast inverse square root was to directly compute an approximation by utilizing the structure of floating-point numbers, proving faster than table lookups. The algorithm was approximately four times faster than computing the square root with another method and calculating the reciprocal via floating point division. The algorithm was designed with the IEEE 754-1985 32-bit floating point specification in mind, but investigation from Chris Lomont showed {{that it could be}} implemented in other floating point specifications.|$|E

The student vote reflected change a lot more than the <b>actual</b> <b>result,</b> as well as widespread anti-conservatism. 93 ridings favoured the Liberals in the student vote, nine favoured the New Democrats, and one favoured the Greens, while the Conservatives were shut out. There was also a vote for elementary students.|$|E

25|$|The British Polling Council {{began an}} inquiry into the {{substantial}} variance between opinion polls and the <b>actual</b> <b>result.</b> Forming the first Conservative majority government since 1992, David Cameron became the first Prime Minister to continue in office immediately after a term of at least four years with a larger popular vote share since 1900, and the only Prime Minister other than Margaret Thatcher to continue in office immediately after a term of at least four years with {{a greater number of}} seats. The Labour Party, led by Ed Miliband, saw a small increase in its share of the vote to 30.4%, but incurred a net loss of seats to return 232 MPs. This was its lowest seat tally since the 1987 general election. Senior Labour Shadow Cabinet members, notably Ed Balls, Douglas Alexander, and Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy, were defeated.|$|E
25|$|James Hildreth {{scored a}} quick 46 off 26 {{deliveries}} at Sophia Gardens as Somerset Sabres set a challenging target of 183 to Glamorgan Dragons. No Glamorgan bowler really had {{control over the}} Somerset batsmen, and yet they lost their wickets. A highlight of the innings was the effort of Somerset's No. 9 Gareth Andrew, who smashed three fours in his first three balls and then was bowled with the fourth. In reply, Glamorgan got to 126 for 2 before part-timers Keith Parsons and Hildreth {{got the better of}} them and took wickets at a leisure - however, Alex Wharf hung in there with Michael Powell and carried the Dragons to 183 for 8 after the 20 overs were up.

A highlight of Somerset's innings was the effort of their number 9 Gareth Andrew, who smashed three fours in his first three balls and then was bowled with the fourth. In reply, Glamorgan got to 126 for 2 before fifth- and sixth-change bowlers Keith Parsons and Hildreth {{got the better of}} them and shared five wickets, leaving Glamorgan at 167 for 7. However, Alex Wharf hung in there with Mike Powell, making 11 off five balls before he was caught off the sixth, and coupled with Powell's unbeaten 68 Glamorgan finished on a total of 183 for 8 after the 20 overs were up. The crowd seemed content with the one point and a tie, but the speaker informed the crowd of the <b>actual</b> <b>result,</b> that under Twenty20 Cup rules the team with the fewer wickets lost would win.|$|E

25|$|A second view, {{based on}} the fact that Greek fire was inextinguishable by water (some sources suggest that water {{intensified}} the flames) suggested that its destructive power was the result of the explosive reaction between water and quicklime. Although quicklime was certainly known and used by the Byzantines and the Arabs in warfare, the theory is refuted by literary and empirical evidence. A quicklime-based substance would have to come in contact with water to ignite, while Emperor Leo's Tactica indicate that Greek fire was often poured directly on the decks of enemy ships, although admittedly, decks were kept wet due to lack of sealants. Likewise, Leo describes the use of grenades, which further reinforces the view that contact with water was not necessary for the substance's ignition. Furthermore, C. Zenghelis pointed out that, based on experiments, the <b>actual</b> <b>result</b> of the water–quicklime reaction would be negligible in the open sea. Another similar proposition suggested that Kallinikos had in fact discovered calcium phosphide, which can be made by boiling bones in urine within a sealed vessel. On contact with water, calcium phosphide releases phosphine, which ignites spontaneously. However, extensive experiments with it also failed to reproduce the described intensity of Greek fire.|$|E

2500|$|In 2013 {{the economy}} grew 3.3%. HSBC chief {{economist}} for Australia and New Zealand, Paul Bloxham, was so impressed that he predicted New Zealand's growth would outpace most of its peers, and he described New Zealand as the [...] "rock star economy of 2014". Another financial commentator said the New Zealand dollar was the [...] "hottest" [...] currency of 2014. Only three months later, The New Zealand Productivity Commission expressed concern about low living standards and problems affecting the long-term drivers of growth. Paul Conway, Director of Economics & Research at the Productivity Commission, wrote: [...] "New Zealand's broad policy settings should generate GDP per capita 20 per cent above the OECD average, but the <b>actual</b> <b>result</b> is more than 20 per cent below average. We may be punching above our weight, but that’s only because {{we are in the}} wrong weight division!" [...] In August, Paul Bloxham, who coined the term [...] "rock star economy", admitted that [...] "the sharp decline in dairy prices over the last six months has clouded the outlook somewhat". In December however Bloxham stated that he thought the New Zealand economy would continue to grow strongly.|$|E
2500|$|Octavian {{wanted to}} solidify {{his status as}} master of the state, but avoid the fate of his adopted father. On January 13 of 27 BC, Octavian {{transferred}} {{control of the state}} back to the Senate and the People of Rome, but, in all likelihood, he knew what the result of such a move would be. Without Octavian, Rome could again descend into chaos and civil war. Neither the Senate nor the People of Rome were willing to accept what was, in effect, Octavian's resignation, and thus Octavian was allowed to remain Roman Consul (the chief-executive under the old Republic), and was also allowed to retain his tribunician powers. Under this arrangement, Octavian now had colleagues who could veto any of his actions. He was probably concerned that his former position appeared to be too monarchical. Now, while he appeared to be re-integrated into the constitutional apparatus, his prestige removed any real risk that a colleague might attempt to obstruct him. This arrangement, in effect, functioned as a popular ratification of his position within the state. If the Senate and the People of Rome wouldn't let him leave office, so the theory went, then he could not be considered a tyrant. The senate then granted Octavian a unique grade of Proconsular imperium (Proconsular command authority) for a period of ten years. With this particular grade of power, he was given power and authority over all Proconsuls. Under the old republic, the Proconsuls governed the more challenging provinces. Therefore, the legions were mostly stationed in these provinces. Under the old system, the Praetors and Pro-Praetors governed the more stable provinces. These provinces, therefore, had very little military infrastructure. Octavian allowed the senate to retain control over these Praetorial provinces. While this appeared to be a sharing of power between Octavian and the senate, the <b>actual</b> <b>result</b> was that Octavian now controlled most of the Roman army. Octavian was also granted the title of [...] "Augustus" [...] by the senate and was made the master of the state by the Senate and the People of Rome. He also took the title of Princeps, or [...] "first citizen". In this, he attempted to establish himself as the [...] "first among equals" [...] rather than as a king, since even by this point in time, monarchy was still repugnant to most Romans. He had taken the dictatorial powers that his adopted father had taken almost twenty years before, but had done so {{in the spirit of the}} republican constitution.|$|E

60|$|Nevertheless, {{in spite}} of this incident, the {{attempts}} at Johnnyboy's physical reformation still went on. More than that, it was argued by some complacent casuists that the pluck displayed by the child was the <b>actual</b> <b>result</b> of this somewhat heroic method of taking exercise, and NOT an inherent manliness distinct from his physical tastes. So he was made to run when he didn't want to--to dance when he frankly loathed his partners--to play at games that he despised. His books and pictures were taken away; he was hurried past hoardings and theatrical posters that engaged his fancy; the public was warned against telling him fairy tales, except those constructed on strictly hygienic principles. His fastidious cleanliness was rebuked, and his best frocks taken away--albeit at a terrible sacrifice of his parents' vanity--to suit the theories of his critics. How long this might have continued is not known--for the theory and practice were suddenly arrested by another sensation.|$|E
60|$|Or, again, if {{you visit}} the villages {{that depend on}} one of the great squires, you will hear praises, often just, of the landlord's good sense or good nature; you will hear of whole systems of {{pensions}} or of care for the sick, like those of a small and separate nation; you will see much cleanliness, order, and business habits in the offices and accounts of the estate. But if you ask again what has been the upshot, what has been the <b>actual</b> <b>result</b> of the reign of landlords, again the answer is plain. At the end of the reign of landlords men will not live on the land. The practical effect of having landlords is not having tenants. The practical effect of having employers is that men are not employed. The unrest of the populace is therefore more than a murmur against tyranny; it is against a sort of treason. It is the suspicion that even {{at the top of the}} tree, even in the seats of the mighty, our very success is unsuccessful.|$|E
