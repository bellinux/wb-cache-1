40|$|A {{fast-acting}} valve {{includes an}} <b>annular</b> <b>valve</b> seat that defines an <b>annular</b> <b>valve</b> orifice between {{the edges of}} the <b>annular</b> <b>valve</b> seat, an <b>annular</b> <b>valve</b> plug sized to cover the valve orifice when the valve is closed, and a valve-plug holder for moving the <b>annular</b> <b>valve</b> plug on and off the <b>annular</b> <b>valve</b> seat. The use of an annular orifice reduces the characteristic distance between {{the edges of the}} valve seat. Rather than this distance being equal to the diameter of the orifice, as it is for a conventional circular orifice, the characteristic distance equals the distance between the inner and outer radii (for a circular annulus). The reduced characteristic distance greatly reduces the gap required between the <b>annular</b> <b>valve</b> plug and the <b>annular</b> <b>valve</b> seat for the valve to be fully open, thereby greatly reducing the required stroke and corresponding speed and acceleration of the <b>annular</b> <b>valve</b> plug.

40|$|International audienceThe {{visualization}} of bioprosthesis leaflet morphology {{might help to}} better understand the underlying mechanism of dysfunction in degenerated aortic bioprosthesis. Because today such {{visualization of}} bioprosthesis leaflet morphology is intricate to impossible with other imaging techniques, we hypothesized that the processing of multi-detector CT images would allow better visualization of the prosthetic valve leaflets after biological aortic valve replacement. The purpose of our study was to prospectively evaluate patients with a degenerated aortic bioprosthesis, waiting for reoperation, by using 64 -slice CT to evaluate prosthetic leaflets morphology. A semi-automatic segmentation of pre-operative tomodensitometric images was conducted, using 2 different implementations of the region growing algorithm. Here we report all segmentation steps (selection of the region of interest, filtering, segmentation). Studied degenerated aortic bioprostheses were represented by two Carpentier-Edwards Supra <b>Annular</b> <b>Valve</b> (porcine leaflets), one Edwards Perimount (pericardial leaflets) and one Medtronic Mosaic (porcine leaflets). Both segmentation methods (Isotropic Region Growing and Stick Region Growing) allowed a semi-automatic segmentation with 3 D reconstruction of all bioprosthetic components (stent, leaflets, degeneration/calcifications). Explanted bioprosthesis CT images were also processed and used as reference. Segmentation results were compared by means of quantitative criteria. Semi-automatic segmentation using region growing algorithm seems to provide an interesting approach for the morphological characterization of degenerated aortic bioprostheses. We believe that in the next future CT scan images segmentation may play an important role {{to better understand the}} mechanism of dysfunction in failing aortic bioprostheses. Moreover, bioprostheses 3 D reconstructions could be integrated into preoperative planning tools to optimize valve-in-valve procedure...|$|E

Labeled valve size {{is not the same}} as millimeter measure of prosthetic valve diameters or the annulus into which it will fit. Studies that use the labeled valve size in lieu of actual measured diameter in millimeters to compare different valves might be misleading. Using human cadaver hearts, we sized the aortic annulus with 8 commonly used prosthetic aortic valve sizers and compared the valves using geometric orifice area. This novel method for comparing prosthetic valves allowed us to evaluate multiple valves for implantation into the same annulus. MethodsAortic annular area was determined in 66 cadavers. Valve sizers for 8 prosthetic valves were used to determine the appropriate valve for aortic valve replacement. Regression analyses were performed to compare the relationship between geometric orifice area and aortic <b>annular</b> area.

40|$|The {{success of}} a bileaflet {{mechanical}} heart valve depends on the absence of persistent flow stases that may cause thrombus formation. Within the valve housing, the only obstruction to blood flow is the leaflets. The leaflet faces are repeatedly washed by blood as the valve opens and closes, but persistent flow stasis can occur at the leaflet pivot due to its size, location and design, as evidenced by recent thrombus-related failure (1 - 3). Therefore, {{it is imperative to}} char-acterize pivot flow of any bileaflet mechanical heart valve design prior to its clinical use (4). Pivot flow analysis is complicated by the geometry of the valve and its pivots. In general, a bileaflet mechanical heart valve typically comprises a rigid <b>annular</b> <b>valve</b> housing and a pair of rotatable leaflets (5 - 9) (Fig. 1). Each leaflet has a pair of ears that pro-trude from the leaflet and mate with the pivot recesses in the valve housing. The leaflet is retained inside the valve housing by the pivots, which control the range of the leaflet movement as the leaflets respond passively to local blood flow pressure gradients. Pivot flow analysis is challenging because the rotating leaflet obstructs visibility, and the complexity and motion of the pivot region result in complex flow that is difficult to measure or simulate. The present study outlines a systematic, detailed method for characterizing pivot flow of the Medtronic ADVANTAGE (ADV) bileaflet mechanical heart valve. This method, which was used during the design process of the ADV, combines both a macroscopic hydrodynamic performance assessment and a micro-scopic flow analysis. The St. Jude Medical (SJM) bileaflet mechanical valve was used as the control in these studies. Address for correspondence...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to provide design and {{operational}} information for the conversion of small turboprop engines into land-based shaft power drives. These can provide economical solutions to individual power requirements such as standby electrical generators, {{combined heat and power}} units, fan drives or centrifugal compressor drives. Considerable numbers of ex-military engines are currently becoming available at economical prices. One such engine is the Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop gas turbine which, although there are over 2000 still in civil and military service worldwide, is now being phased out of Royal Air Force operation. This paper describes the modification of a Dart RDa 12 engine to drive a centrifugal compressor from a smaller RDa 7, Mk 552, engine for a compressed air facility on a university campus. The modified engine has a power of over 2400 hp (1790 kW) at 15000 r/min and the compressor was driven directly from the engine output shaft supplying 10. 5 kg/s of air at a pressure ration of 3. 3 : 1. To achieve this, the turboprop's main reduction gearbox was removed, the teeth on the engine drive pinion ground down and a flexible coupling fitted to it to drive the RDa 7 compressor which was flange mounted on the engine gearbox-air intake casing. The removal of the main gearbox removed the drives to the lubricating oil pumps the fuel pump and the engine control system. The manner in which these problems were overcome and the method of operating the system are described. One of the most important considerations in starting such a direct drive system is the complete closing off of the air intake to the driven compressor and the design of an <b>annular</b> <b>valve</b> to perform this duty is described.

To prospectively study this feature, 18 normal pregnant women were followed during their pregnancies and puerperium, with serial clinical and pulsed-continuous Doppler echocardiographic examinations. in four gestational periods and the puerperium, we analysed: (a) ventricular and atrial dimensions, as well as <b>valve</b> <b>annular</b> diameters; (b) prevalence and characteristics of trivial valvular regurgitations. During pregnancy, slight but significant increases of the four cardiac chamber dimensions and <b>valve</b> <b>annular</b> diameters were observed, except for the aortic ring. the prevalence of physiologic valvular regurgitation in early pregnancy (mitral, 0 %; tricuspid, 38. 9 %; pulmonary, 22. 2 %; aortic, 0 %), was similar. to a control group of 18 healthy non-pregnant women. As pregnancy evolved, there was a progressive and significant increase of multivalvular regurgitation, maximal at full-term (mitral, 27. 8 %; tricuspid, 94. 4 %; pulmonary, 94. 4 %, P < 0. 05 vs. early pregnancy). Aortic regurgitation was not detected in any stage of pregnancy. in the puerperium, mitral regurgitation resolved, but tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitation were still significantly prevalent (83. 3 % and 66. 7 %, respectively, P < 0. 05 vs. early pregnancy). It is concluded that physiologic multivalvular regurgitation is frequent in pregnancy, mainly involving right-sided valves in late gestational periods, occasionally persisting in the early puerperium. Chamber enlargement, <b>valve</b> <b>annular</b> dilatation, and increased prevalence of trivial valve regurgitation are time-related events during normal pregnancy, resulting from a reversible cardiac remodeling process induced by physiologic volume overload.

The intraoperative Trans Oesophageal Echocardiogram (TOE) on weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass confirmed a dilated mitral annulus with moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). We elected not to place an annuloplasty ring in anticipation of improvement with postoperative remodelling. However, mitral regurgitation worsened after discharge becoming moderately severe and remains so after 1 year follow-up despite optimal medical treatment.

BackgroundClinically silent brain infarcts defined by MRI are associated with increased risk for cognitive decline, dementia, and future overt stroke. Left-sided cardiac valvular and annular calcifications are suspected as risk factors for clinical ischemic stroke. MethodsA total of 2, 680 CHS (Cardiovascular Health Study) participants without clinical histories of stroke or transient ischemic attack underwent brain MRI in 1992 and 1993, 1 to 2 years before echocardiographic exams (1994 to 1995). ResultsThe mean age of the participants was 74. 5 ± 4. 8 years, and 39. 3 % were men. The presence of any annular or valvular calcification (mitral annular calcification, aortic annular calcification, or aortic <b>valve</b> sclerosis), mitral <b>annular</b> calcification alone, or aortic annular calcification alone was significantly associated with a higher prevalence of covert brain infarcts in unadjusted analyses (p < 0. 01 for all). In models adjusted for age, sex, race, body mass index, physical activity, creatinine, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, coronary heart disease, and congestive heart failure, the presence of any <b>annular</b> or <b>valve</b> calcification remained associated with covert brain infarcts (risk ratio: 1. 24; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 05 to 1. 47).

Supra-annular prosthesis implantation can facilitate mitral valve replacement with a larger prosthesis in children with a small annulus, but little is known about its effect on the outcomes of mitral valve replacement in young children. MethodsOne hundred eighteen children underwent mitral valve replacement at 5 years of age or younger from 1976 – 2006. Mitral valve replacement was supra-annular in 37 (32 %) patients. ResultsSurvival was 74 % ± 4 % at 1 year and 56 % ± 5 % at 10 years but improved over time (10 -year survival of 83 % ± 7 % from 1994 – 2006). Factors associated with worse survival included earlier mitral valve replacement date, age less than 1 year, complete atrioventricular canal, and additional procedures at mitral valve replacement, but not supra-annular mitral valve replacement. As survival improved during our more recent experience, the risks of supra-annular mitral valve replacement became apparent; survival was worse among patients with a supra-annular prosthesis after 1991. A pacemaker was placed in 18 (15 %) patients within 1 month of mitral valve replacement and was less likely in patients who had undergone supra-annular mitral valve replacement. Among early survivors, freedom from redo mitral valve replacement was 72 % ± 5 % at 5 years and 45 % ± 7 % at 10 years. Twenty-one patients with a supra-annular prosthesis underwent redo mitral valve replacement.

These promising devices have the adaptivity of the fully active systems to accommodate varying external excitations while maintaining the reliability and fail-safe features of the passive systems. Compared with ER based devices or systems, MR based devices have recently received special attention due to their high performance with minimal power requirements. Moreover MR fluids have significantly higher yield strength and are less sensitive to contaminants and temperature compared with the ER fluids. The geometric optimal design of MR valves/dampers {{is an important issue}} to improve the damper performance, such as damping force, valve ratio and inductive time constant. Considering this, the primary {{purpose of this study is}} to establish a general design optimization methodology to optimally design single–coil <b>annular</b> MR <b>valves</b> constrained in a specific volume in MR damper. To accomplish this, first the damping force of MR damper has been modeled using Bingham plastic model. The magnetic circuit of MR damper has been analyzed using finite element method in ANSYS environment to obtain magnetic field intensity which can be subsequently used to obtain the yield stress of the MR fluid in the active volume where the magnetic flux crosses. Then the developed finite element model of the MR valve is effectively used to construct an approximate response function relating the magnetic field intensity to the identified design parameters in the selected design space using response surface method and design of experiment methodology. Using the derived approximate relation for the magnetic field intensity in the MR damper model, the design optimization problem has been formulated using gradient based nonlinear mathematical programming technique based on the Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) technique and also stochastic optimization technique based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find optimal geometrical parameters of the MR valve in order to maximize the damping performance under given constrained volume. Finally a PID controller has been designed to evaluate the close-loop performance of the optimally designed MR damper in a quarter-car suspension model. ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Children with {{ventricular}} septal defects (VSD) {{can have}} chronic volume overload, which {{can result in}} changes of left heart echocardiographic parameters. To evaluate the changes before and after surgical closure, the children were divided into three groups according {{to the degree of}} mitral regurgitation (MR), and their echocardiographic characteristics were reviewed at serial follow-up after surgical closure. METHODS: The preoperative, and one-, three-, and 12 -month postoperative echocardiographic data of 40 children who underwent surgical closure of VSD were retrospectively reviewed. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD), left ventricular end-systolic dimension (LVESD), mitral valvular characteristics, including degree of MR and mitral valve annulus, and left atrial (LA) characteristics, including volume and dimensions, were observed. RESULTS: Preoperative LVEDV, LVEDD, LVESD, mitral valvular annulus, LA volume, and LA dimensions were significantly larger in children with MR. Additionally, there were significant decreases in LVEDV, LVEDD, LA volume, and LA dimensions at one, three, and 12 months postoperatively. The degree of MR also improved to a lower grade after surgical closure of the VSD without additional mitral valve repair. CONCLUSION: The echocardiographic parameters of left heart dilation and MR in children with VSD improved within the first year after surgical closure without additional mitral valve repair. Furthermore, in all of the patients with VSD, regardless of MR, LA dilation was reduced within three months after surgical closure of the VSD; however, LV and mitral <b>valve</b> <b>annular</b> dilatation decreased within 12 months...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesOur {{purpose was}} to {{evaluate}} a tissue Doppler-based index—peak myocardial acceleration (pACC) —during isovolumic relaxation and in evaluating left ventricular (LV) diastolic function. BackgroundSimple, practical indexes for diastolic function evaluation are lacking, but are much desired for clinical evaluation. MethodsWe examined eight sheep by using tissue Doppler ultrasound images obtained in the apical four-chamber views to evaluate mitral <b>valve</b> <b>annular</b> velocity at the septum and LV wall. The pACC thus derived was analyzed during isovolumic relaxation (IVRT) and during the LV filling period (LVFP). We then changed the hemodynamic status of each animal by blood administration, dobutamine, and metoprolol infusion. We compared the pACC values during IVRT and LVFP over the four different hemodynamic conditions with a peak rate of dropin LV pressure (−dP/dtmin) and the time constant of LV isovolumic pressure decay (tau), as measured with a high-frequency manometer-tipped catheter. ResultsThe pACC of the septal side of the mitral valve annulus during IVRT showed a good correlation with −dP/dtmin(r = − 0. 80, p < 0. 0001) and tau (r = − 0. 87, p < 0. 0001). The mean left atrial pressure (LAP) correlated well with the septal side pACC during LVFP (r = 0. 81, p < 0. 0001). There was a weak correlation between the mitral valve annulus pACC at the LV lateral wall and mean LAP. ConclusionsThe pACC during IVRT is a sensitive, preload-independent marker for evaluation of LV diastolic function. In addition, pACC during LVFP correlated well with mean LAP...|$|R
40|$|Magnetorheological (MR) fluid {{is one of}} the field-responsive fluids that is of {{interest}} to many researchers due to its high yield stress value, which depends on the magnetic field strength. Similar to electrorheological (ER) fluid, the combination of working modes {{is one of the}} techniques to increase the performance of the fluids with limited focus on MR fluids. In this paper, a novel MR testing cell incorporated with valve, shear and squeeze operational modes is designed and constructed in order to investigate the behaviour of MR fluid in combined mode. The magnetic field distribution in the design concept was analyzed using finite element method in order to verify the effective areas of each mode have the acceptable range of flux density. The <b>annular</b> gap of <b>valve</b> and shear were fixed at 1 mm, while the squeeze gap between the parallel circular surfaces was varied up to 20 mm. Three different coil configurations, which were made up from 23 SWG copper wires were set up in the MR cell. The simulation results indicated that the magnetic field distributed in the squeeze gap was the highest among the other gaps with all coils were subjected to a constant applied current of 1 A. Moreover, the magnetic flux densities in all gaps were in a good range of magnitude based on the simulations that validated the proposed design concept. Hence, the 3 D model of the MR testing cell was designed using Solidworks for manufacturing processes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundSevere tricuspid {{regurgitation}} {{is associated}} with poor prognosis; however, there are limited Class I indications for intervention, and high–surgical risk patients may go untreated. We report the first-in-human successful transcatheter tricuspid valve repair for severe tricuspid regurgitation. ObjectivesThe objective {{of this study was}} to show the feasibility of a transcatheter tricuspid annular repair. MethodsCompassionate-use approval for the procedure was obtained from the regulatory organization in Germany. To perform the transcatheter bicuspidization of the tricuspid valve, the Mitralign system was used to place pledgeted sutures by means of a trans-jugular venous approach. Insulated radiofrequency wires were positioned 2 to 5 mm from the base of the posterior leaflet, 2. 6 cm apart. The sutures were drawn together and locked, plicating the posterior annulus. ResultsReconstruction of the 3 -dimensional transesophageal echocardiographic dataset at baseline revealed a tricuspid <b>valve</b> <b>annular</b> area of 14. 1 cm 2, and effective regurgitant orifice area was 1. 35 cm 2. There was a significant reduction in annular area (57 %) and effective regurgitant orifice area (53 %) measured with 3 -dimensional transesophageal echocardiography, at 6. 05 cm 2 and 0. 63 cm 2, respectively. Hemodynamic parameters also improved with a reduction in right atrial pressure from 22 mm Hg at baseline, to 9 mm Hg and an increase in left ventricular stroke volume from 42 ml at baseline to 72 ml. ConclusionsTranscatheter tricuspid valve repair could become an effective treatment for high–surgical risk patients who are non-responsive to optimal medical therapy...|$|R
40|$|In stroke {{patients}} several cardiac changes {{associated with}} embolism {{can be detected}} with transoesophageal echocardiography. Potential major cardiac embolic sources (e. g. atrial fibrillation, thrombi of left ventricle/atrium, vegetation, myxoma, dilated cardiomyopathy) have a causal relationship to embolism. Other changes with no certain causal relationship are regarded as potential minor cardiac embolic sources (e. g. atrial septal aneurysm, patent foramen ovale, mitral <b>annular</b> calcification, mitral <b>valve</b> prolapse, protruding atheroma of the aorta). We compared the prevalences of major and minor potential cardiac embolic sources in a stroke population with that in controls. One hundred and twenty-one patients with first-ever stroke were compared with 68 randomly selected controls. All subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, carotid ultrasound and transthoracic/transoesophageal echocardiography. The patients were slightly older (mean age 70. 7 +/- 10. 3 years) than the controls (65. 5 +/- 15. 5 years) (p 74 years) the prevalence of potential minor cardiac embolic sources did not differ between patients and controls. To conclude, major potential cardiac embolic sources are more common in an older population with first-ever stroke than in a comparable control group. However, potential minor cardiac embolic sources {{did not differ in}} prevalence in the patients compared with controls. Certain changes (e. g. atrial septal aneurysm) might have a potential embolic role in younger stroke patients but in our study no difference was found between older stroke patients and controls...|$|R
30|$|For precise aortic <b>valve</b> <b>annular</b> sizing {{and root}} evaluation, ECG-gated CT angiograms of the {{ascending}} aorta and heart are obtained with either prospective or retrospective ECG triggering. Aortic valve and root assessment during systole {{has been shown}} to be preferable to during diastole because of the larger annular size noted in systole as well as dynamic changes [28, 29]. Thus, with both prospective and retrospective gating, the data should be acquired during systole (usually 20 – 50  % phase of the cardiac cycle) with no radiation during the rest of the cycle in prospective ECG triggering and very aggressive dose modulation with retrospective gating, allowing substantial dose savings. No routine administration of β-blockers is used for scanning purposes because of concerns with underlying severe aortic stenosis. A high incidence of arrhythmia in TAVR candidates precludes routine use of prospective gating on a routine basis. As a result, the estimated radiation dose may be relatively high, but acceptable given the advanced age of the vast majority of TAVR candidates and the amount of information acquired. For younger patients, with stable and low heart rates, prospective axial acquisition during the systolic phase is suggested [26]. Tube potential of 100  kV is suggested for patients weighing less than 90  kg or with a body mass index (BMI) less than 30, whereas a tube potential of 120  kV is usually indicated for patients weighing more than 90  kg (BMI > 30). The lowest setting possible should be selected in keeping with acceptable image noise [30].|$|R
40|$|Aims—To {{determine}} whether mitral annular calcification and aortic valve calcification, {{with or without}} stenosis, are expressions of atherosclerotic disease.  Methods—The incidence of atherosclerotic risk factors was analysed in patients with mitral annular calcification and aortic valve calcification and in control patients from a prospective echocardiographic database of 8160  consecutive patients; 657  patients (8 %) were identified with mitral annular calcification and 815  (9 %) with a calcified aortic valve, of whom 515  (6. 3 %) had stenosis with a minimal aortic valve gradient of 16  mm Hg. In these patients, cardiac and vascular risk factors were compared with 568  control patients using multiple logistic regression analysis.  Results—Age (odds ratio (OR) varying from 5. 78  to 104, depending on age class), female sex (OR 1. 75), hypertension (OR 2. 38), diabetes mellitus (OR 2. 85), and hypercholesterolaemia (OR 2. 95) were strongly and significantly associated with aortic valve calcification without stenosis, as were age (OR varying from 8. 82  to 67, depending on age class), female sex (OR 2. 22), hypertension (OR 2. 72), diabetes mellitus (OR 2. 49), and hypercholesterolaemia (OR 2. 86) with mitral annular calcification. Age (OR varying from 1. 11  to 7. 7), hypertension (OR 1. 91), and hypercholesterolaemia (OR 2. 55) were strongly and significantly associated with stenotic aortic <b>valve</b> calcification.  Conclusions—Mitral <b>annular</b> calcification and stenotic or non-stenotic aortic valve calcification have {{a high incidence of}} atherosclerotic risk factors, suggesting they should be considered as manifestations of generalised atherosclerosis.    Keywords: mitral <b>annular</b> calcification;  aortic <b>valve</b> calcification;  calcified aortic stenosis;  risk factor...|$|R
