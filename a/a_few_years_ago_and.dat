Of the song, Swift said that: [...] "This is a song I wrote <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> I have been working on it ever since.

2500|$|The 1890s and 1900s {{marked the}} height of the [...] "yellow peril" [...] {{propaganda}} by the German government and the German Emperor Wilhelm II often wrote letters to his cousin Nicholas II of Russia, praising him as the [...] "savior of the white race" [...] and urging Russia forward in Asia. From November 1894 onward, Wilhelm had been writing letters praising Nicholas as Europe's defender from the [...] "yellow peril", assuring the Tsar that God Himself had [...] "chosen" [...] Russia to defend Europe from the alleged Asian threat. On 1 November 1902, Wilhelm wrote to Nicholas that [...] "certain symptoms in the East seem to show that Japan is becoming a rather restless customer" [...] and [...] "it is evident to every unbiased mind that Korea must and will be Russian". Wilhelm ended his letter with the warning that Japan and China would soon unite against Europe, writing: [...] "Twenty to thirty million Chinese, supported by a half dozen Japanese divisions, led by competent, intrepid Japanese officers, full of hatred for Christianity—that is a vision of the future that cannot be contemplated without concern, and it is not impossible. On the contrary, it is the realisation of the yellow peril, which I described <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> I was ridiculed by the majority of people for my graphic depiction of it... Your devoted friend and cousin, Willy, Admiral of the Atlantic". Wilhelm aggressively encouraged Russia's ambitions in Asia as France, Russia's ally since 1894, was less than supportive of Russian expansionism in Asia, and it was believed in Berlin that German support of Russia might break up the Franco–Russian alliance and lead to a new German–Russian alliance. The French, who had been Russia's closest allies since 1894, {{made it clear that they}} disapproved of Nicholas's forward policy in Asia with the French Premier Maurice Rouvier publicly declaring that the Franco–Russian alliance applied only to Europe, not Asia, and that France would remain neutral if Japan attacked Russia. The American president Theodore Roosevelt, who was attempting to mediate the Russian–Japanese dispute, complained that Wilhelm's [...] "yellow peril" [...] propaganda, which strongly implied that Germany might go to war against Japan in support of Russia, encouraged Russian intransigence. On 24 July 1905, in a letter to the British diplomat Cecil Spring Rice, Roosevelt wrote that Wilhelm bore partial responsibility for the war as [...] "he has done all he could to bring it about", charging that Wilhelm's constant warnings about the [...] "yellow peril" [...] had made the Russians uninterested in compromise as Nicholas believed that Germany would intervene if Japan attacked. The implicit promise of German support suggested by Wilhelm's [...] "yellow peril" [...] speeches and letters to Nicholas led many decision-makers in St. Petersburg to believe that Russia's military weaknesses in the Far East like the uncompleted Trans-Siberian railroad line did not matter as it was assumed the Reich would come to Russia's assistance of if war should come. In fact, neither Wilhelm nor his Chancellor Prince Bernhard von Bülow had much interest in East Asia, and Wilhelm's letters to Nicholas praising him as Europe's savior against the [...] "yellow peril" [...] were really meant to change the balance of power in Europe as Wilhelm believed that if Russia was embroiled with Japan, this would break up the Franco–Russian alliance and lead to Nicholas signing an alliance with Germany. This was especially the case as Germany had embarked upon the Tirpitz plan and a policy of Weltpolitik meant to challenge Britain's position as the world's leading power, and since Britain was allied to Japan, then if Russia and Japan could be manipulated into going to war with each other, that this in turn would lead to Russia turning towards Germany. Furthermore, Wilhelm believed if a Russian–German alliance emerged, France would be compelled to join it and having Russia pursue an expansionist policy in Asia would keep Russia out of the Balkans, thus removing the main source of tension between Russia and Germany's ally Austria–Hungary. During the war, Nicholas who took at face value Wilhelm's [...] "yellow peril" [...] speeches, placed much hope in German intervention on his side, and more than once, Nicholas chose to continue the war out of the belief that the Kaiser would come to his aid.|$|E
