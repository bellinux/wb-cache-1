5|$|The often uproarious and {{spectacular}} Cuocolo trial attracted <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> of newspapers {{and the general}} public both in Italy {{as well as in the}} United States, including by Pathé's Gazette. The trial was transformed from a murder trial into one against the Camorra as a whole. The hearings began in the spring of 1911 and would continue for twelve months. Fabbroni intended to use the trial to strike the final blow to the Camorra. The trial was attended by the former mayor of New York City, George B. McClellan, in whose administration Petrosino was killed.|$|E
30|$|Two-dimensional (2 D) atomic {{crystals}} with planar surfaces {{have attracted}} <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>attentions</b> recently {{due to their}} potential application in spintronic devices [11 – 24]. Graphene and its several 2 D analogues, such as hexagonal boron nitride and carbon nitride, have great potential for spintronics because of their exceptional properties, e.g., low dimensionality and electron confinement. Although most of these materials are non-magnetic in nature, there are many ways, such as doping and strain to reach the half-metallic ferromagnetism. For example, B, Al, and Cu embedded trizaine-based g-C 3 N 4 (gt-C 3 N 4) {{have been reported to}} be half-metallic [14]. The graphene-like carbon nitride also presents half-metallicity under tensile strain [17]. In addition, the heptazine-based g-C 3 N 4 (gh-C 3 N 4) has received <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>attentions</b> [25 – 33].|$|R

He was sentenced to 30 years in prison in July 1912, and despite the fact that the legitimacy of the trial was seriously questioned when the main witness for the prosecution retracted, he was only released in 1934 after having served 27 years.|$|E
5|$|Whistler {{created the}} {{painting}} {{in the winter of}} 1861–62, though he later returned to it and made alterations. It was rejected both at the Royal Academy and at the Salon in Paris, but eventually accepted at the Salon des Refusés in 1863. This exhibition also featured Édouard Manet's famous Déjeuner sur l'herbe, and together the two works gained <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention.</b> The White Girl shows clearly the influence of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, with whom Whistler had recently come in contact. The painting has been interpreted by later art critics both as an allegory of innocence and its loss, and as a religious allusion to the Virgin Mary.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to drug smuggling, Noriega's associates such as Floyd Carlton and Cesar Rodríguez also eventually {{became involved with}} money laundering: large sums from drug revenues were brought in from Miami and elsewhere to Panama for laundering, and Noriega received protection payments in these instances as well. American Steven Kalish also began a large scale business selling drugs, laundering money and selling hardware to the Panamanian military for large profits with Noriega's assistance. Dinges writes that in {{at the time of}} the 1984 election, Kalish was preparing to ship a load of marijuana worth U.S. $1.4 million through Panama, for which Noriega had agreed to provide false Panamanian customs stamps to help it avoid scrutiny in the U.S.; Noriega was to be payed $1 million for this exercise. However, beginning in 1984 Noriega appeared to reduce the scale of his operations, and even ordered a raid against a cocaine factory in the interior of Panama, a raid which he then emphasized as evidence of his cooperation with the U.S. in their fight against drugs. He also ordered a crackdown on money laundering by the Colombian cartel. Noriega's new image was symbolized by his being invited as a speaker in 1985 to Harvard University, for a conference on the role of the military in Central America's wars, a speech which received <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> in Panama's pro-government press.|$|E

25|$|Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs) {{have gained}} <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> {{because they are}} much less {{susceptible}} to development of microbial resistance. Other antibiotics may be susceptible to bacterial resistance, like multi-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) which {{is known as a}} common relic in the healthcare industry while other bacterial strains have become more of a concern for waste water treatment in local rivers or bays. AMPs can be functionalized onto a surface by either chemical or physical attachment. AMPs can be physically attached by using oppositely charged polymeric layers and sandwiching the polypeptide between them. This may be repeated to achieve multiple layers of AMPs for the recurring antibacterial activity. There are, however, a few drawbacks to this mechanism. Assembly thickness and polymer-peptide interactions can affect the diffusion of peptide to bacterial contact. Further research should be carried out to determine the effectiveness of the adsorption technique. However, they chemical attachment of AMPs is also widely studied.|$|E
