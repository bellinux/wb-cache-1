5|$|High on {{the eastern}} flank of Mount Rainier is a peak known as Little Tahoma Peak, , an eroded remnant of the earlier, much higher, Mount Rainier. It has a {{prominence}} of , and it is <b>almost</b> <b>never</b> climbed in direct conjunction with Columbia Crest, so it is usually considered a separate peak. If considered separately from Mt. Rainier, Little Tahoma Peak would be the third highest mountain peak in Washington.|$|E
5|$|Riesling is <b>almost</b> <b>never</b> {{fermented}} or aged in new oak (although large old oak barrels {{are often}} used to store and stabilize Riesling based wines in Germany and Alsace). This means that Riesling tends to be lighter weight and therefore suitable to {{a wider range of}} foods. The sharp acidity/sweetness in Rieslings can serve as a good balance to foods that have a high salt content. In Germany, cabbage is sometimes cooked with riesling to reduce the vegetable's smell.|$|E

5|$|TRAX is a three-line urban {{light rail}} mass transit system {{operated}} by the Utah Transit Authority (UTA), serving much of the Salt Lake Valley in Utah, United States. (The official name of TRAX is Transit Express, however this name is <b>almost</b> <b>never</b> used.) Communities served by the service include Draper, Midvale, Murray, Salt Lake City, Sandy, South Jordan, South Salt Lake, West Jordan, and West Valley City.|$|E
5|$|Whether it {{involved}} {{the history of}} the number zero or the invention of the transistor, two things stood out to me. First is that the discovery {{that turns out to be}} the most valuable is usually dismissed as a side-effect. Second is that prototypes <b>almost</b> <b>never</b> include neon lights and chrome. I wanted to see a story play out that was more in line with the way real innovation takes place than I had seen on film before.|$|E
5|$|Cores {{are often}} drilled {{in areas such}} as Antarctica and central Greenland where the {{temperature}} is <b>almost</b> <b>never</b> warm enough to cause melting, but the summer sun can still alter the snow. In polar areas, the sun is visible day and night during the local summer and invisible all winter. It can make some snow sublimate, leaving the top inch or so less dense. When the sun approaches its lowest point in the sky, the temperature drops and hoar frost forms on the top layer. Buried under the snow of following years, the coarse-grained hoar frost compresses into lighter layers than the winter snow. As a result, alternating bands of lighter and darker ice can be seen in an ice core.|$|E

5|$|Meetings {{could take}} place either inside or outside of the formal {{boundary}} of the city (the pomerium), though the official meeting place, or curia was at {{the centre of the}} Roman forum. The president of the Senate was normally one of the consuls, but it could be called to meet by any of the praetors or tribunes, both of whom had the authority to call the Senate, though praetors rarely did so unless the consuls were away and the tribunes <b>almost</b> <b>never</b> did so. Meetings were suffused in religious ritual. Temples were a preferred meeting site and auspices would be taken before the meeting could commence.|$|E
5|$|Passing {{through the}} hands of four owners during its troubled 23-year history, Nittany Furnace never {{fulfilled}} the expectations developed when it replaced the antiquated (charcoal) Bellefonte Furnace. It should arguably never have been built: {{by the time it}} went into blast in 1888, the price per ton of iron had already been driven below $22, a historic low, and it would <b>almost</b> <b>never</b> rise above that figure until the onset of World War I. The sprawling steel works of Pittsburgh, fed by Mesabi Range ore, could produce iron more cheaply than the furnaces at Bellefonte ever could. The principal advantage of a Bellefonte location — proximity to local ore deposits — was negated by the availability of easily mined, high-grade Mesabi ore, hauled by rail.|$|E
5|$|The Algo Centre Mall (legally Eastwood Mall since 2005 but <b>almost</b> <b>never</b> {{referred}} to as such) was a mall and hotel located {{in the middle of}} Elliot Lake, Ontario's commercial district on Highway 108. It was the largest commercial complex in the area. When the community was hit by uranium mine closures in the 1990s, the complex gradually refocused, hosting multiple services, such as a library, constituency offices, and public health offices. In recent years, many businesses located in the mall either closed or moved to outside locations. Still, the mall was a community hub, with most of the area's clothing stores and its largest grocery store, employing upwards of 250 local residents. It accounted for 10% of community's retail space and 6% of the total wages.|$|E

5|$|The club's record home {{attendance}} is 23,002, for an FA Cup match against QPR on 10 January 1948, a record which will <b>almost</b> certainly <b>never</b> be broken unless the club relocates {{to a larger}} ground, given that Priestfield Stadium's current capacity is approximately half that figure.|$|R
50|$|On April 7, 1817, Tompkins County {{was created}} by {{combining}} portions of Seneca and the remainder of Cayuga County. The county was named after then Vice-President (to President James Monroe) and former New York Governor Daniel Tompkins. Tompkins <b>almost</b> certainly <b>never</b> visited the county named for him.|$|R
5|$|The Budapest Gambit saw a {{short-lived}} revival in 1984–85 when Chess Informant included three games (as many {{as in the}} previous fifteen years), all played at a high level of competition, and all won by Black. But White players found reinforcements and even invented a line with 4.e3 and 5.Nh3. In the 21st century, despite Shakhriyar Mamedyarov's successful efforts to rehabilitate the line 4.Bf4 g5, the Budapest Gambit <b>almost</b> <b>never</b> appears at the highest level. Its most recent appearance was when Richárd Rapport defeated Boris Gelfand with Black using the opening in round 2 of the 2014 Tata Steel Chess competition.|$|E
5|$|The Master Chief is {{a towering}} and faceless biochemically and cybernetically-enhanced supersoldier, raised and trained {{from an early}} age to be a weapon; he is <b>almost</b> <b>never</b> seen without his green-colored armor and helmet. He is {{commonly}} referred to by his naval rank, rather than his given birth-name or serial-designation. The character is voiced by Steve Downes, a Chicago disc jockey, in the video games in which he appears. Downes based his personification of the Chief on an initial character sketch which called for a Clint Eastwood–type character of few words.|$|E
5|$|The music, however, was {{not written}} by Fordham, {{but rather by}} several composers, {{including}} Paul Perry (a member of The Worthless Peons), Scrubs composer Jan Stevens, and Tony Award-winner Doug Besterman, each of whom helped write and arrange several songs. But, perhaps the most notable contributors were Jeff Marx and Robert Lopez, the writers of hit Broadway musical Avenue Q. Marx and Lopez's involvement came {{at the suggestion of}} Braff, who overheard Fordham asking producer Randall Winston if {{it would be possible to}} get actual Broadway composers to work on the episode. Fordham did have some contribution to the music, in the form of musical genre suggestions, but during the actual composition process, she and the composers were <b>almost</b> <b>never</b> in the same room.|$|E

Most Korean NGOs, when I {{ask them if they}} would like to join an event, (they) <b>almost</b> have <b>never</b> done their own fundraiser before. They usually have a hard time organizing one, so it’s not too common,’’ she said.|$|R
60|$|Lodloe's {{common sense}} {{was capable of}} {{considerable}} tension without giving way, even under a strain like this, and, although pale with anger, he would not engage in a personal contest with a deck-hand on a crowded steamboat; but to bear the insult was <b>almost</b> impossible. <b>Never</b> before had he been subjected to such violent abuse.|$|R
5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow forages {{slowly on}} or near the ground by walking or hopping under shrubs or dense grasses. Though it {{occasionally}} forages in weedy areas, it is <b>almost</b> <b>never</b> observed foraging in the open. It has occasionally been observed feeding in branches and low shrubs. During the breeding season, it gleans its food from grasses and low shrubs. However, normally the species obtains its food by either pecking or less frequently scratching at leaf litter. This bird tends to forage in a small family group and in a limited area.|$|E
5|$|During the day, Pacific {{angelsharks}} are <b>almost</b> <b>never</b> {{seen in the}} open, instead resting motionless on the {{sea floor}} buried under {{a thin layer of}} sediment that disguises their outlines. At night some individuals remain motionless, waiting for prey, while others may be encountered on the bottom unburied or actively swimming. Large sharks, including the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) and the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus), and the northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) are known to consume Pacific angelsharks. Known parasites of this species include the copepod Trebius latifurcatus, which infests the skin, the myxosporidian Chloromyxum levigatum, which infests the gall bladder, and the tapeworm Paraberrapex manifestus, which infests the spiral valve intestine. The leech Branchellion lobata may be attached around this shark's cloaca, inside the intestine, and even inside the uterus and on developing embryos.|$|E
5|$|In his lifetime, J. R. R. Tolkien {{never ceased}} to {{experiment}} on his constructed languages, {{and they were}} subjected to many revisions. Therefore, Quenya had many grammars with substantial differences between the different stages of its development. During the first conceptual stage of early Quenya c. 1910 to c. 1920, the language was called Elfin in English and Eldarissa in Qenya proper. While its development was a continuous process, Quenya underwent {{a number of major}} revisions in its grammar, mostly in conjugation and the pronominal system. The vocabulary, however, was not subject to sudden or extreme change. Tolkien sometimes changed the meaning of a word, but he <b>almost</b> <b>never</b> discarded it once invented, and he kept on refining its meaning, and countlessly forged new synonyms. Moreover, Elvish etymology was in constant flux. Tolkien delighted in inventing new etymons for his Quenya vocabulary. But after the publication of The Lord of the Rings (finished c. 1949–1950, published in 1954–1955), the grammar rules of Quenya went through very few changes and this version was then defined as late Quenya (c. 1950–1973).|$|E
50|$|The rise of Uljana Semjonova, {{who joined}} TTT Riga in 1965, {{at the age}} of 13, {{confirmed}} golden status of „TTT". From 1964 to 1975 TTT earned 12 consecutive European titles. In 18 seasons of international competition Uljana Semjonova never lost a game in national team competition, a record that will <b>almost</b> certainly <b>never</b> be repeated.|$|R
50|$|Glazunov <b>almost</b> {{certainly}} <b>never</b> {{heard his}} Saxophone Concerto publicly performed, {{as the first}} Paris performance of the work did not occur until after his death. He made no mention in his letters of any collaboration with another composer on the concerto. However, in 1936, the publishing company made an addition to the piano reduction: they added A. Petiot as a second composer.|$|R

5|$|Royal assent or {{sanction}} is {{the method}} by which a country's monarch (possibly through a delegated official) formally approves an act of that nation's parliament. In certain nations, such assent makes the act law (promulgation) while in other nations assent is distinct from promulgation. In {{the vast majority of}} contemporary monarchies, this act is considered to be little more than a formality; even in those nations which still permit their monarchs to withhold royal assent (such as the United Kingdom, Norway, and Liechtenstein), the monarch <b>almost</b> <b>never</b> does so, save in a dire political emergency or upon the advice of their government. While the power to withhold royal assent was once exercised often in European monarchies, it is exceedingly rare in the modern, democratic political atmosphere that has developed there since the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|The Driver {{has been}} {{compared}} to the Man With No Name, a character Clint Eastwood portrayed in the Sergio Leone western, because he <b>almost</b> <b>never</b> speaks, communicating mostly non-verbally. The Driver's meager dialogue is not designed to present him as tough, but to soften him. Refn chose to give The Driver very little dialogue and instead have him drive around listening to synth-pop music, taking control when it counts. Peter Debruge of Variety opined that what The Driver lacks in psychology, he makes up through action and stylish costuming. The Driver's wardrobe, in particular the satin jacket with the logo of a golden scorpion on the back, was inspired by the band KISS, and Kenneth Anger's 1964 experimental film Scorpio Rising. Refn sees the former as the character's armor, and the logo as a sign of protection. According to reviewer Peter Canavese, the jacket is a reference to the fable of the scorpion and the frog, mentioned in the film, which in turn evokes its use in the Orson Welles film Mr. Arkadin.|$|E
5|$|The mild seas that {{surround}} Portland act to keep night-time temperatures above freezing, making winter frost rare: on average 9.6 days per year— {{this is far}} below the United Kingdom's average annual total of 55.6 days of frost. Days with snow lying are equally rare: on average zero to six days per year; almost all winters have {{no more than one}} day with snow lying. It may snow or sleet in winter, yet it <b>almost</b> <b>never</b> settles on the ground—coastal areas in South West England such as Portland generally experience the mildest winters in the UK. Portland is less affected by the Atlantic storms that Devon and Cornwall experience. The growing season lasts for more than 310 days per year, and the borough is in Hardiness zone 9.|$|E
60|$|Hot tears {{which he}} tried vainly to repress fell upon her fingers. He {{had felt the}} kiss {{descending}} on him almost like a benediction. The exquisite fragrance of her person filled his soul with a great delight which was <b>almost</b> pain. <b>Never</b> had he loved her so ardently, so passionately, as at this moment, when he felt that she too loved him, and yet was lost to him irrevocably.|$|R
60|$|Captain Wybrow was silent. He felt out of humour, wearied, annoyed. There come {{moments when}} one <b>almost</b> determines <b>never</b> again to oppose {{anything}} but dead silence to an angry woman. 'Now then, confound it,' {{he said to}} himself, 'I'm going to be battered on the other flank.' He looked resolutely at the horizon, with something more like a {{frown on his face}} than Beatrice had ever seen there.|$|R
50|$|In local {{folklore}} {{there is}} another legendary story of its origin: Hans von Trotha (around 1450-1503), a castellan regionally known as the robber baron, Hans Trapp, of the South Palatine castle of Bertwartstein (who <b>almost</b> certainly <b>never</b> visited the Heidenmauer site which had already fallen into ruins 2000 years ago), {{was supposed to have}} hidden a large supply of sausage in the ditch; this legend gave rise to its popular name, the Wurstgraben ("sausage ditch").|$|R
