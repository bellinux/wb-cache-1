5|$|Business Loop Interstate 96 (BL I-96) is a {{business}} loop of I-96 through the city of Lansing. The western terminus is at I-96's exit90 northwest of Lansing in Watertown Township in Clinton County near the I-96/I-69 junction. From there, it follows Grand River Avenue under I-96. East of I-96, BL I-96 intersects Francis Road, which provides access to I-69, and then passes under I-69. Grand River Avenue is three lanes, one in each direction divided by a central turn lane, and runs past light industrial areas, crossing into Lansing and Eaton County near the Capital Region International Airport. The area around the airport is commercial, but east of there North Grand River Avenue runs through residential neighborhoods. Near the intersection with Martin Luther King Jr Boulevard, the business loop runs along the Grand River and then BL I-96 turns eastward on North Street to an interchange with Cedar and Larch streets. The business loop turns and splits onto the one-way pairing of the three-lane Cedar (southbound) and Larch (northbound). As it runs southward, the highway runs parallel to the Grand River through Old Town Lansing. <b>At</b> <b>Oakland</b> Avenue (westbound) and Saginaw Avenue (eastbound), BL I-96 intersects the two one-way streets that carry BL I-69. It continues south through {{the eastern edge of}} downtown Lansing.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Werblin's co-owners {{gave him}} an ultimatum– either buy them out or be bought out. He chose the latter option, {{reportedly}} profiting $1.4million for his 1963 investment of $250,000. Prior to Werblin's departure, the Jets had considered firing Ewbank. They attempted to secure Green Bay Packers coach Vince Lombardi, but Lombardi decided to remain in Green Bay one more season. The season started with the usual three road games due to the team's status as secondary tenant to the Mets at Shea Stadium. The Jets rose {{to the top of}} the AFL East; they had lost only two games by mid-November and built a three-game lead over second-place Houston. New York's next game was <b>at</b> <b>Oakland.</b> In what became known as the Heidi Game, the Jets took a 32–29 lead with 68seconds left, only to have Oakland score two touchdowns to win the game. However, the touchdowns went unseen by much of the national TV audience, as NBC had switched at 7:00p.m. to a TV movie of Heidi. Nevertheless, the Jets won their remaining games to finish 11–3. In the playoffs, the Jets defeated the Raiders for the AFL Championship at Shea Stadium, 27–23, a game in which Namath threw three touchdowns, including the game winner to Don Maynard in the fourth quarter.|$|E
5|$|On January 18, 2001, the Jets {{announced}} Herman Edwards {{as the new}} coach. Edwards, {{a former}} defensive back who had {{worked his way up}} through the NFL coaching system, had never served as head coach at any level. He was the first African-American Jets head coach. Edwards lost his first game, two days before the September 11 attacks. In the wake of 9/11, the NFL had to decide whether to play its games the following weekend. Testaverde and the Jets spoke out against playing on the weekend after 9/11, and the Jets were prepared to forfeit the game rather than fly. The NFL decided to move that week's games {{to the end of the}} regular season. The Jets needed to win that game, in Oakland against the Raiders, to reach the playoffs, and John Hall kicked a last-minute 53-yard field goal for a 24–22 victory and a playoff berth. Edwards was the first coach to lead the Jets to the playoffs in his first year with the team. In the playoffs, the Jets again played <b>at</b> <b>Oakland.</b> New York could not stop the Raiders' passing game, and Oakland won, 38–24.|$|E

5|$|After {{starting}} all 16 {{games at}} outside cornerback in 2014, Munnerlyn settled into nickel back role, playing in all 16 regular season games with five starts {{as well as}} the Wild Card Round of the playoffs. He helped the Vikings defensive unit rank fifth in the NFL in defensive points allowed at 18.9 points per game, playing {{a key role in the}} Vikings winning the NFC North title over long-time reigning champs Green Bay Packers for the first time since 2009. In Week 10, he started the game <b>at</b> <b>Oakland</b> and posted a season-best 7 tackles against the Raiders. Four weeks later, he recorded seven solo tackles again in the loss at Arizona Cardinals on December 20. He posted his first sack as a Viking when he corralled Packers' quarterback Aaron Rodgers in Week 11. The following week, he got his first pick of the season when he intercepted Falcons' quarterback Matt Ryan. In the final game of the regular season against the Green Bay Packers for the NFC North title, the Vikings had a 13-3 lead with just over four minutes remaining in the third quarter. On a 3rd-and-12 play, Aaron Rodgers dropped back to his own 45-yard line to make a pass, but Vikings defensive end Everson Griffen got a hand on Rodgers' arm, causing him to fumble; Munnerlyn scooped up the ball at the 55-yard line and with blocking support from safety Andrew Sendejo and linebacker Anthony Barr, ran it all the way back for a touchdown (his first on a fumble recovery). Munnerlyn recorded 55 tackles, a sack, one fumble recovery for a touchdown, 2 interceptions, and 4 pass deflections in his second season in Minnesota.|$|E
5|$|The Ryder Cup {{was played}} {{outside of the}} British Isles {{for the first time}} in 1997, as Valderrama Golf Club in Spain hosted the contest. Despite taking a five-point lead into the final day, Europe needed the half point Colin Montgomerie secured in his tied singles match with Scott Hoch to win 14½–13½. The 1999 match was the third time in {{succession}} the contest had been won by a single point, but this time it was the United States who won 14½–13½. This was not without controversy, as Europe were unhappy with the celebrations by the American team after a putt by Justin Leonard, while European golfer José María Olazábal still had a chance of holing his putt. The Ryder Cup was scheduled to be played in 2001, but two weeks before the competition was scheduled to take place the September 11 attacks occurred. The United States fearing for their safety requested the match be played a year later in 2002. When the match was played, Europe won 15½–12½ to regain the Cup. They retained the Cup in 2004 when they won 18½–9½ <b>at</b> <b>Oakland</b> Hills Country Club, in what was the United States' heaviest defeat in the competition. The result was repeated in 2006 at the K Club. Europe's 18½–9½ victory marked the first time they had won three matches in succession. The United States regained the Ryder Cup in 2008, winning for the first time since 1999. They won the match when Jim Furyk beat Miguel Ángel Jiménez with four singles matches still ongoing, to win 16½–11½. A tight contest in 2010 came down to the final singles match between European Graeme McDowell and American golfer Hunter Mahan. McDowell won his match with a hole to spare, to give Europe a 14½–13½ victory. Europe recovered a 10–6 deficit on the last day in 2012, as they won eight of the twelve singles matches to win 14½–13½.|$|E

This meant that peoples' only options for burial <b>at</b> <b>Oakland</b> were to either buy a plot from a private owner or be buried in Potter's Field, and records show that many people opted for the latter.
