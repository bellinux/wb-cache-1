In such large <b>Aloha</b> <b>systems</b> the channel uncertainty is captured by a notion of effective interference and thus the packet success probability depends only on the mean composite arrival per dimension and is independent {{of the number of}} users that transmit packets in a particular slot. It is shown that with Poisson new arrival the numbers of backlogged packets, transmitted packets, and successful packets in each slot in the limiting system all are Poisson distributed. Moreover, their means – the backlog, offered load, and steady throughput per dimension can be obtained by a deterministic iterative equation. The stability and the capacity are analyzed. To consider guaranteed QoS transmission- and delay-constrained capacities are then defined. All MAC performance measures are obtained in closed forms instead of bounds. It is shown that the stability and capacity are independent of packet transmission probability though the backlog and packet delay depend on the transmission probability. The results are applied to large CDMA <b>Aloha</b> <b>systems</b> that employ random independent equiprobable spreading sequences.
