5|$|A {{waterspout}} is {{an intense}} columnar vortex (usually appearing as <b>a</b> funnel-shaped <b>cloud)</b> that occurs over {{a body of}} water.

5|$|Cloud seeding {{was first}} {{attempted}} by Vincent Schaefer and Irving Langmuir.

A dove with a white halo, representing the Holy Spirit, flies just below God, wings outstretched, completing the Trinity. Above Jesus fly four cherubim. Seated to Jesus' right is Mary, his mother, and to his left Saint John the Baptist. On the same cloud as Jesus, three angels flank on each side. Slightly below Jesus, Mary, and John, two more flanking angels are depicted kneeling on their own clouds and swinging censers. Under the entire scene, a banner displays Gloria in Excelsis Deo.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} over {{the definition of}} <b>a</b> funnel <b>cloud</b> and <b>a</b> condensation funnel. According to the Glossary of Meteorology, <b>a</b> funnel <b>cloud</b> is any rotating <b>cloud</b> pendant from <b>a</b> cumulus or cumulonimbus, and thus most tornadoes are included under this definition. Among many meteorologists, the 'funnel cloud' term is strictly defined as <b>a</b> rotating <b>cloud</b> which is not associated with strong winds at the surface, and condensation funnel is a broad term for any rotating <b>cloud</b> below <b>a</b> cumuliform <b>cloud.</b>|$|R

5|$|A light novel titled Shikamaru Hiden: <b>A</b> <b>Cloud</b> Drifting in Silent Darkness, {{written by}} Takashi Yano and {{illustrated}} by Kishimoto, stars Shikamaru as the main character and narrator.

It also explores his growing relationship with Temari, culminating in him struggling to name his child with her, {{years after the end of}} the novel.|$|E
5|$|Development of MediEvil: Resurrection {{began in}} 2003.

5|$|Due to Langmuir's efforts, and the {{research}} of Schaefer at General Electric, the concept of using cloud seeding to weaken hurricanes gathered momentum. Indeed, Schaefer had caused a major snowstorm on December 20, 1946 by seeding <b>a</b> <b>cloud.</b> This caused GE to drop out for legal reasons. Schaefer and Langmuir assisted the U.S. military as advisors for Project Cirrus, the first large study of cloud physics and weather modification.

25|$|Clouds {{initially}} form {{in clear}} air or become clouds when fog rises above surface level. The genus of <b>a</b> newly formed <b>cloud</b> is determined mainly by air mass {{characteristics such as}} stability and moisture content. If these characteristics change over time, the genus tends to change accordingly. When this happens, the original genus is called <b>a</b> mother <b>cloud.</b> If the mother cloud retains much of its original form after {{the appearance of the}} new genus, it is termed <b>a</b> genitus <b>cloud.</b> One example of this is stratocumulus cumulogenitus, <b>a</b> stratocumulus <b>cloud</b> formed by the partial spreading of a cumulus type when there is a loss of convective lift. If the mother <b>cloud</b> undergoes <b>a</b> complete change in genus, it is considered to be <b>a</b> mutatus <b>cloud.</b>|$|R
