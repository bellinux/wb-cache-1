They were not convinced that he was talented enough to pursue a musical career, but feeling {{it would be wrong}} to prevent him from trying, they had allowed him to go to the RCM. Nevertheless, a university education was expected of him, and in 1892 he temporarily left the RCM and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he spent three years, studying music and history.|$|E

While waiting for the sergeants to arrive, Princip and Grabež had a falling out with Čabrinović over Čabrinović's {{repeated}} violations of operational security. Čabrinović handed over the weapons he was carrying to Princip and Grabež. Princip told Čabrinović to go alone to Zvornik, make an official crossing there using Grabež's ID card <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> to Tuzla and link back up.|$|E

5|$|John Cena and Chris Jericho were {{involved}} in the main rivalry on the Raw brand over the World Heavyweight Championship. At WWE's November Survivor Series, Cena returned to the WWE after a legitimate neck injury (that he sustained at SummerSlam) and defeated Jericho to win the championship. On the November 24 episode of Raw, Jericho defeated Randy Orton and Batista in a Triple Threat match to earn a title match against Cena at Armageddon. Later that night, Chris Jericho attempted to steal Cena's thunder, claiming that he plans on winning back the title at Armageddon. When World Champion, John Cena could even make his much anticipated return to Raw, he then gave Jericho an opportunity to confront him face-to-face, Cena explained the difference between himself and Jericho, stating that he actually cares about the many members of the WWE Universe. After Jericho once again stated his intention to beat Cena at Armageddon and continued to belittle the WWE Universe, Cena snapped. He proceeded to brutalize Jericho, throwing him against the announce table, bludgeoning him with the steel stairs and locking him into an STFU. On the following week's episode of Raw, Jericho made his presence known {{in much the same way}} as Cena did the week before, addressing the audience as he made his way through the crowd down to the ring. The difference however, was that while Cena welcomed his fans, Jericho made pains to ignore them. He then went on to explain his resentment toward Cena, stating that while away from the WWE since August 2005, Jericho's son grew to be a fan, not of his father, but of John Cena. Now, Jericho hopes to show his son and all of the WWE what a real hero is, by beating Cena for the World Heavyweight Title at Armageddon. Later that night, Cena fought Kane in Raw's main event. Though Jericho attempted to become involved, Cena managed to fight off <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> to defeat Kane. After the match, Cena chased Jericho, who was attempting to escape. The tables turned, however, when Randy Orton, Cody Rhodes and Manu emerged to attack Cena, allowing Jericho to lock Cena in the Walls of Jericho.|$|E

25|$|The blacking-warehouse was {{the last}} house on the {{left-hand}} side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, {{and the sound of}} their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.|$|E

500|$|Getting It {{received}} mixed, {{but generally}} positive, reviews. [...] One positive evaluation came from psychiatrist James Charney, in a 1976 review for Library Journal. [...] Charney calls the book [...] "the only useful {{critical look at}} this essential issue", referring to the est training. [...] He notes in particular that Fenwick's [...] "analysis of {{the function of the}} group, the restrictive rules, and the enforced discomfort is convincing". In a 1977 review in Library Journal Edith Crockett and Ellis Mount highly recommended the book, commenting that [...] "A plethora of newspaper and magazine reports, along with books written by graduates... have attempted to explain the phenomenon of this self-help program, but none has done it as well or as objectively as this writer." [...] Kirkus Reviews noted the precedent set by the analytical nature of the book, writing [...] "Finally. Here's someone who is willing to disclose the details of Erhard Seminars Training, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> to analyze them from a psychological point of view." [...] Zane Berzins, writing for The New York Times Book Review in 1977, describes Fenwick's work as a [...] "calm and professionally informed view". [...] Berzins describes the book as a [...] "brave attempt" [...] at an analysis of est's appeal, and concludes that [...] "It's hardly an incendiary exposé, but Fenwick's open-minded scrutiny should deglamourize the est movement." ...|$|E

If the record company needs another album, you go and make one." [...] Noting the subdued and melancholy tone of much of the album, producer George Martin recalled: [...] "They were rather war weary during Beatles for Sale. One must remember that they'd been battered like mad throughout 1964, and much of 1963. Success is a wonderful thing but it is very, very tiring." ...|$|E
