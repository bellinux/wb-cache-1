50|$|Engines {{using the}} Diesel cycle are usually more efficient, {{although}} the Diesel cycle itself is less efficient at equal compression ratios. Since diesel engines use much higher compression ratios (the {{heat of compression}} is used to ignite the slow-burning diesel fuel), that higher ratio more to <b>air</b> <b>pumping</b> losses within the engine.|$|E

By assuming the attenuation power proportional to average speed of vertical direction of wave surface, the <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> rooms are replaced by three barriers. The basic equation in case of one <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> room is established, and this basic equation is extended and is used for this research.

50|$|The company {{specialized}} in hot <b>air</b> <b>pumping</b> engines. A hot air engine is an external combustion engine. All hot air engines {{consist of a}} hot side and a cold side. Mechanical energy is derived from a hot air engine as air is repeatedly heated and cooled, expanding and contracting, and imparting pressure upon a reciprocating piston.|$|E
5000|$|The US Rider-Ericsson Engine Company was the {{successor}} of the DeLamater Iron Works and the Rider Engine Company, having bought from both companies their extensive plants and entire stocks of engines and patterns, covering all styles of Rider and Ericsson hot <b>air</b> <b>pumping</b> engines brought out by {{both of the}} old companies since 1844, excepting the original Ericsson engine, the patterns of which were burned in the DeLameter fire of 1888.|$|E
50|$|The large {{vertical}} blowing engine illustrated {{was built}} in the 1890s by E. P. Allis Co. of Milwaukee (later to form part of Allis-Chalmers). The <b>air</b> <b>pumping</b> cylinder is above the steam power cylinder and crosshead. The main force of the piston is transmitted to the air cylinder by a purely reciprocating action and the flywheels are there merely to smooth the action of the engine. The flywheel shaft is mounted below the steam piston, the paired connecting rods driving downwards and backwards.|$|E
25|$|Temperature {{must also}} be {{accounted}} for because the <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> will heat the air passing through it making the air down stream of it less dense and more viscous. This difference must be corrected for. Temperature is measured at the test piece plenum and at the metering element plenum. Correction factors are then applied during flow calculations. Some flow bench designs place the <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> after the metering element so that heating by the <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> is not as large a concern.|$|R

50|$|A blowing {{engine is}} a large {{stationary}} steam engine directly coupled to <b>air</b> <b>pumping</b> cylinders. They are used to provide the air blast for blast furnaces {{and other forms of}} smelter. As the working cylinder and the driven load are both reciprocating pistons, they may be directly coupled by their piston rod. The connecting rod is only used to drive a flywheel whose inertia balances load through the cycle of the engine, not as an output shaft. These engines were some of the last new return connecting rod designs to be built.|$|E

5000|$|Grade‑D {{air supply}} (or {{self-contained}} oil-less <b>air</b> <b>pump)</b> - The <b>air</b> feed hose is typically {{attached to a}} grade‑D pressurized air supply. Grade‑D air is mandated by OSHA to protect the worker from hazardous gases. It includes a pressure regulator, air filtration and a carbon monoxide monitor/alarm. An alternative method is a self-contained, oil-less <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> to feed pressurized air to the blast hood/helmet. An oil-less <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> does not require an air filter or carbon monoxide monitor/alarm, because the pressurized air is coming from a source that cannot generate carbon monoxide.|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using an electromagnetic actuator {{as an important}} part in a portable diaphragm <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> is investigated. The ideal electromagnetic actuator will have capabilities of producing large deflection and high tuneable frequency. These two characteristics make the actuator very attractive for the present application. Much effort has been put into the development of the proposed diaphragm <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> because it is easily integrated into the complex system. The characteristics of the magnetic field of the electromagnetic coils are thoroughly investigated in order to complete the design optimization for the proposed electromagnetic actuator. As the base of the design optimization for the proposed planar and cylindrical coils, the proposed model of magnetic field distribution for a circular current loop is developed. The design optimization for various parameters of planar coils was thoroughly investigated. Approximate approaches to determine the electromagnetic forces are discussed. Models for diaphragm deflection were determined. The fluid model for evaluation of flow rate form the output of diaphragm pump was developed. The {{feasibility of}} using nozzle/diffuser elements as components of <b>air</b> <b>pumps</b> is investigated. The geometry of nozzle/diffuser elements was designed and the chamber configuration for the proposed electromagnetic <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> was determined. The proposed <b>air</b> <b>pumps,</b> including the electromagnetic actuator, PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) diaphragm, and chamber and nozzle/diffuser elements were built. Several experiments were conducted to investigate the performances of the proposed electromagnetic actuator including the deflection of diaphragm and frequency characteristics. The flow rate of the proposed <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> was measured. In conclusion this study supplies solid evidence of achievements using electromagnetic actuators in <b>air</b> <b>pumps...</b>|$|R

The <b>pump's</b> <b>air</b> intake is filtered by a rotating screen to exclude dirt particles {{large enough to}} damage the system. Air is delivered under light pressure to the injection point(s). A check valve prevents exhaust forcing its way back through the air injection system, which would damage the pump and other components.|$|R
40|$|Resonance {{frequency}} shift of a zinc oxide- (ZnO-) functionalized microcantilever {{as a response}} to carbon monoxide (CO) gas has been investigated. Here, ZnO microrods were grown on the microcantilever surface by a hydrothermal method. The measurement of resonance frequency of the microcantilever vibrations due to the gas was carried out in two conditions, that is, gas flow with and without <b>air</b> <b>pumping</b> into an experiment chamber. The results show that the resonance frequency of the ZnO-functionalized microcantilever decreases because of CO in <b>air</b> <b>pumping</b> condition, while it increases when CO is introduced without <b>air</b> <b>pumping.</b> Such change in the resonance frequency is influenced by water vapor condition, and a possible model based on water-CO combination was proposed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>pumping</b> {{effect of}} a fire plume to give higher intake rate through {{vertical}} openings in a post-flashover room fire {{will be discussed in}} this paper. The thermal balance equation was set up with known fire phenomena in a room. The hydrostatic model was applied to study the air intake rate through vertical openings. An equation relating heat release rate to room air temperature rise with empirical constants was then justified by reported experimental data on post-flashover room fire. The heat release rate was measured by the oxygen consumption method in that experiment. The predicted heat release rate from the empirical equation reported in the literature was observed to be proportional to the room air temperature rise as derived from hydrostatics. However, the proportionality constant is lower than the experimental value. A possible explanation is due to neglecting another fire phenomenon on <b>air</b> <b>pumping</b> action of the fire plume in a real room fire. Higher pressure differences across the door would give higher airflow rates across an opening. This would supply more air to give higher heat release rate as observed in the experiment. In this paper, the pressure due to <b>air</b> <b>pumping</b> of the fire plume is taken as a proportion of the hydrostatic pressure due to temperature differences between the upper hot layer and lower cool layer. Comparing the measured heat release rate with the estimated heat release rate due only to hydrostatics will give the <b>air</b> <b>pumping</b> action. The possible increase in heat release rate in a post-flashover fire can then be estimated accordingly. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|In {{the aim of}} {{reducing}} noise emissions, {{it is important to}} better understand and model tyre rolling noise which is the main source of traffic noise at medium and high speed. <b>Air</b> <b>pumping</b> is a major source of tyre/road contact noise. This noise source is still not well understood and includes several mechanisms. In this context, a modelling approach using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is presented. The approach consists of highlighting some mechanisms of <b>air</b> <b>pumping</b> occurring in the cavities at the contact area without any volume variation. The dynamic deformation of the rubber is not considered. The goal is to model some phenomena such as air compression and air drainage by considering air flow in the contact zone. A 3 D CFD model of air compression and release phenomena caused by the rolling of a smooth tyre over road cavities is implemented. The model is applied to academic configurations such as a cylindrical cavity and an open transversal groove. The noise reduction due to the ventilation of the contact zone by a longitudinal groove is also investigated. This work shows the relevance of modelling air flow to study <b>air</b> <b>pumping,</b> and gives further insights into this phenomenon...|$|E

40|$|Internoise 2014, MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIE, 16 -/ 11 / 2014 - 19 / 11 / 2014 Several {{mechanisms}} {{induced by}} the tyre/road interaction contribute to the generation of rolling noise. The road texture has {{a significant role in}} this process, together with the possible porosity of the road pavement. The latter may influence the noise sources in the high frequency range in which <b>air</b> <b>pumping</b> is supposed to contribute. Even on dense road surfaces with no vertical porosity, possible air flow allowed by the road texture in the contact patch is equivalent to the effect of a so-called 'lateral' porosity which is reckoned to have an influence on the source strength. In this paper, the effect of this lateral porosity is studied with a modelling approach using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). This approach allows the highlighting of some phenomena occurring in the contact patch such as air compression due to the tyre rolling process or air drainage. Simulations are carried out for a smooth tyre and road textures made of more or less connected cavities. A parametric study is presented {{in the case of a}} 2 D academic configuration to show the influence of air flow resistance in the contact zone on <b>air</b> <b>pumping</b> noise.

40|$|This study {{includes}} the first work about {{the absorption of}} a panel absorber under the effects of microperforation, <b>air</b> <b>pumping,</b> and linear and nonlinear vibrations. In practice, thin perforated panel absorber is backed by a flexible wall to enhance the acoustic performance within the room. The panel is easily excited to vibrate nonlinearly and the wall can vibrate linearly. However, the assumptions of linear panel vibration and no wall vibration are adopted in many research works. The development of the absorption formula {{is based on the}} classical approach and the electroacoustic analogy, in which the impedances of microperforation, <b>air</b> <b>pumping,</b> and linear and nonlinear vibrations are in parallel and connected to that of the air cavity in series. Unlike those finite element, numerical integration, and multiscale solution methods and so forth, the analytic formula to calculate the absorption of a panel absorber does not require heavy computation effort and is suitable for engineering calculation purpose. The theoretical result obtained from the proposed method shows reasonable agreement with that from a previous numerical integration method. It can be concluded that the overall absorption bandwidth of a panel absorber with an appropriate configuration can be optimized and widened by making use of the positive effects of microperforation, <b>air</b> <b>pumping,</b> and panel vibration...|$|E

40|$|The <b>air</b> <b>pumping</b> {{effect of}} a fire plume, {{proposed}} years ago, to give a higher air intake rate through vertical openings in a compartment fire is further investigated in this paper. Equations for the air intake rate through vertical openings {{found in the literature}} are reviewed. As most of the reported correlation expressions were derived empirically from experiments, results might be different if the fire geometry, fuel type and ambient conditions are different. Furthermore, most of the data on heat release rates in earlier experiments were measured from the mass loss rate of fuel, not by the oxygen consumption method. Values used therefore might deviate from the actual heat release rates. Aerodynamic flow through a doorway, induced by a compartment fire, is commonly simulated by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Factors which are difficult to control in experiments but affecting the doorway airflow can be studied more easily with CFD. In the study presented in this paper a two-room structure with a fire room connected to an adjacent room through a door was selected. Different door widths linking the two rooms were set to give different ventilation factors. A total number of 16 simulations using the popular CFD software, Fire Dynamics Simulator, based on large eddy simulations, were carried out with different heat release rates of a fire in the fire room. Predicted horizontal velocity components were used to estimate the air intake rates through the door to justify the <b>air</b> <b>pumping</b> action. It appears that there is an <b>air</b> <b>pumping</b> effect of the fire plume for cases with lower ventilation factors, even for pre-flashover fires. Results further confirmed earlier experimental data on post-flashover fires. Therefore, further study on possible air pump effects in a room fire is strongly recommended.
