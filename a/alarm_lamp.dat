40|$|The current {{consumption}} method of Electric Power Industry is “electricity consumption first, {{paying for it}} later”. The trend of consumption method is Pre-order Electricity. If we adopt the Pre-order Electricity System, we need to replace Traditional Energy Meter with Prepayment Energy Meter. But this alteration is costly. And the alarm action of Prepayment Energy Meter are bells and <b>alarm</b> <b>lamp,</b> users can not receive alarm information timely. In this paper, we present the design of Multi-user Electric Power Management Device. The device uses TMS 320 F 2812 as CPU, with peripheral devices such as mobile phone communication module MC 55, so the device supports remote operation and sends alarm information via SMS, it also can communicate with the master station by GPRS. The device can be seamlessly integrated into the existing power system in order to read meter, achieve billing and Pre-order Electricity functions. In addition, the device has the Harmonic Measurement function, {{so it is a}} high cost-effective application...|$|E
40|$|Vibration comfort is an {{important}} factor affecting the quality of service (QoS) of bus. In order to make people involved in supervising bus’s vibration comfort and improve passengers’ riding experience, a novel mode of passenger crowdsourcing is introduced. In this paper, comfort degree of bus vibration is calculated from bus’s vibration signals collected by passengers’ smartphones and sent through WiFi to the Boa web server which shows the vibration comfort on the LCD deployed in bus and maybe trigger <b>alarm</b> <b>lamp</b> when the vibration is beyond the threshold. Three challenges here have been overcome: firstly, space coordinate transformation algorithm is used to solve the constant drift of signals collected; secondly, a low-pass filter is designed to isolate gravity from signals real-timely via limited computing resources; thirdly, an embedded evaluation system is developed according to the calculation procedure specified by criterion ISO 2631 - 1997. Meanwhile, the model proposed is tested in a practical running environment, the vibration data in whole travel are recorded and analyzed offline. The results show that comfort degree of vibration obtained from the experimental system is identical with the truth, and this mode is proved to be effective...|$|E
50|$|In {{industrial}} process control, an annunciator panel {{is a system}} to alert operators of alarm conditions in the plant. Multiple back-lit windows are provided, each engraved {{with the name of}} a process <b>alarm.</b> <b>Lamps</b> in each window are controlled by hard-wired switches in the plant, arranged to operate when a process condition enters an abnormal state (such as high temperature, low pressure, loss of cooling water flow, or many others). Single point or multipoint alarm logic modules operate the window lights based on a preselected ISA 18.1 or custom sequence.|$|R
50|$|Bedside tables, nightstands, {{or night}} tables are small tables {{used in a}} bedroom. They are often used for {{convenient}} placement of a small <b>lamp,</b> <b>alarm</b> clock, glasses, or other personal items.|$|R
50|$|A nightstand, {{alternatively}} night table, {{bedside table}} or bedside cabinet, {{is a small}} table or cabinet designed to stand beside a bed or elsewhere in a bedroom. Modern nightstands are usually small bedside tables, often with one or sometimes more drawers and/or shelves and less commonly with a small door. They are often used to support items that might be useful during the night, such as a table <b>lamp,</b> <b>alarm</b> clock, reading matter, phone, eyeglasses, desktop intercom, a drink, or medication.|$|R
40|$|Have {{been made}} {{equipments}} of system controller of house security by SMS (Short Message Service) with microcontroller ATMega 8535 and programed by C language. This system expected can help someone {{to observe and}} control situation of house, by exploiting technology of SMS Gateway. This system use 2 functioning censor as censor move and 1 of relay which incircuit with a alarm. Process data system use IC Microcontroller ATMega 8535 which programed with C Ianguage through compiler program of CodeVisionAVR. System connected with Siemens SL 45 handphone functioning as server. Data interfaced to handphone serially. From test result it seen that the system can work automatically to deliver the commemoration if happened danger to a pawnbroker {{in the form of}} certain text format in the form of SMS. Besides that owner also can control the <b>alarm</b> and <b>lamp</b> only by sending certain text format of SMS...|$|R
50|$|A {{focus of}} the new {{architecture}} was the desire to improve the living conditions of the scientists and staff on the station. Solutions included consulting a color psychologist to create a special color palette to offset the more than 100 days of darkness each year, daylight simulation <b>lamp</b> <b>alarm</b> clocks to address biorhythm issues, the use of special wood veneers to imbue the scent of nature and address the lack of green growth, as well as lighting design and space planning to address social interaction needs and issues of {{living and working in}} isolation.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe world {{demographic}} projections {{showed a}} rise of the elderly population as result {{of the increase in}} life expectancy. To check all the possible assistance to the elderly to live this new stage with dignity, autonomy, self-reliance, mobility, security, health and well-being, is a challenge for the Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technology approach. In this sense, this study attempted to create an Android software to allow disabled and elderly persons to control home devices (<b>lamps,</b> <b>alarm,</b> etc.) and to obtained temperature and other information through speech via an Android Phone...|$|R

"Screwed at {{its axis}} against the side, a {{swinging}} lamp slightly oscillates in Jonah's room; and the ship, heeling over towards the wharf {{with the weight}} of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and all, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight itself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it hung. The <b>lamp</b> <b>alarms</b> and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance. But that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him. The floor, the ceiling, and the side, are all awry. 'Oh! so my conscience hangs in me!' he groans, [...] "straight upward, so it burns; but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness!' ...|$|R
5000|$|The USB {{connector}} (and voltage) {{has emerged}} as a de facto standard in low-power AC adapters for many portable devices. In addition to serial digital data exchange, the USB standard also provides 5 VDC power, up to 500 mA (900 mA over USB 3.0). Numerous accessory gadgets ("USB decorations") were designed to connect to USB only for DC power and not for data interchange. The USB Implementers Forum in March, 2007 released the USB Battery Charging Specification which defines, [...] "...limits as well as detection, control and reporting mechanisms to permit devices to draw current in excess of the USB 2.0 specification for charging ...". [...] Electric fans, <b>lamps,</b> <b>alarms,</b> coffee warmers, battery chargers, and even toys have been designed to tap power from a USB connector. Plug-in adapters equipped with USB receptacles are widely available to convert 120 VAC or 240 VAC power or 12 VDC automotive power to 5 VDC USB power (see photo at right).|$|R
