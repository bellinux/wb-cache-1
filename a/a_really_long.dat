500|$|For the CGI used {{throughout}} the film, companies Rhythm & Hues (R) and Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) developed {{different parts of the}} film. R focused on the animation of the animals, while ILM completed the final scene of the ark rushing through Washington D.C.

[...] The company initially experienced problems creating the water effects and had to develop new tools which would choreograph the movements of the water. In addition, ILM used similar tools that were used on their prior film Poseidon. Lighting was also an issue as the characters on the ark had been filmed on a greenscreen stage, and the visual effects company had to ensure that the lighting matched that of the characters and the outside setting. Details were added to the ark for long-distance shots to make the design of the ark more appealing and relate the ark's size to scale in comparison to the amount of water. To complete the scene, ILM used thirty to sixty crew members and produced 200 shots over a yearlong period between April 2006 and May 2007.|$|E

[...] Joginder Tuteja from Bollywood Hungama gave a rating 4 out 5 and wrote, [...] "Kaminey is certainly not a run of the mill album {{and this is where}} its prime strength lies. The album boasts of at least three chartbuster tracks'Dhan Te Nan' (sure shot superhit), 'Thode Bheege' (must for the hearts in love) and 'Raat Ke Dhai Baje' (for some 'masti' and 'hungama'). Songs like 'Fatak' and 'Kaminey' are innovative and situational which showcase the range of Vishal Bhardwaj. Add to that the 'Go Charlie Go– Theme Music' and you know that Kaminey is yet another addition to some excellent albums that have hit the stands during last one month." [...] Planet Bollywood rated the album 8.5 out of 10 and said it is the best soundtrack released that year, and that [...] "t has experimentations with both music and lyrics".

500|$|Critical {{response}} to the album was, overall, fairly laudatory. Its score of 79 out of 100 – or 'generally favorable' – on Metacritic attests to decent reception. Regarding its place in Isis' catalog, it {{has been described as}} their [...] "most accomplished and complete album to date" [...] by Ali Maloney of The Skinny, as their [...] "smartest and richest record" [...] and as [...] "the toughest and catchiest Isis record" [...] since their debut full-length, Celestial." [...] Beyond the band's own repertoire, it was described as [...] "metal played at its arresting best", and Andrew Rennie of NOW went as far as declaring it [...] "close to perfect". Not all reviews were so glowing, as the NME characterized it as [...] "45 minutes of awesomeness stretched out to a slightly bloated hour [...] the unsettling Toolisms of 'Ghost Key' meander just too long and 'Hand of the Host' spends half of its 11 minutes repeating itself without really juddering into the granite riff golem it threatens to be." [...] Similarly, Chris Norton of Tiny Mix Tapes feels that the album [...] "isn't the band's best by <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>long</b> shot, even if it ain't bad." [...] Accessibility was a similarly divisive issue, with the album being characterized as [...] "perhaps their most rewarding yet, but simultaneously their hardest to immediately access given its prioritising of subtle nuances over senses-numbing assaults" [...] and [...] "a slow-burning success". Conversely, it has also been declared to be [...] "easily the band's most accessible effort". Allmusic's William Ruhlmann felt that with regards to structure, [...] "Wavering Radiant works as a single piece of music rather than a series of songs", as Milton Savage of Drowned in Sound concurred that Isis have [...] "construct their latest so that it's best experienced as a whole".|$|E

5000|$|A running gag {{throughout}} the strip is Odie's idiocy. Garfield frequently calls him a moron, {{to the point}} where Odie was completely shocked one day when Garfield didn't insult him. He is mostly viewed as an idiot, but in rare cases, it is shown that he hides his high intelligence. For example, once while he, Garfield, and Jon were camping, he locked himself in the car. Garfield and Jon got angry, but then a thunderstorm arrived. Odie turned on the radio and lights and started to eat chips, smiling while Jon and Garfield were trapped outside with no food or shelter during the thunderstorm. Another time, when Garfield and Jon were out, Odie was reading War and Peace, smoking a pipe, and watching a television special about Mozart. Another running gag is Odie's impossibly long tongue. In one strip, when Garfield taunted Odie {{for not being able to}} write with his paws, he was completely bewildered when Odie's tongue grabbed a pen and wrote, [...] "Hi there." [...] In another strip, Odie is running around the family room, and Garfield grabs on to his tongue to see how long it is. The next panel shows Odie right next to Garfield, but with his tongue literally wrapped around all the furniture, going through the hallway, wrapping around Odie himself and Garfield, and with room to spare, much to Garfield's shock. Another strip shows Garfield theorizing how Odie can have such a long tongue, and store it in his mouth. He then guesses that he has the rest of his tongue stored in where his brain should be, also stating how much of an idiot he is. Also, in one winter themed Sunday strip, Odie's tongue is stuck to a lamp post stretched from two blocks to Jon's dining room, prompting Garfield to tell Jon, [...] "We need a blow dryer and <b>a</b> <b>really,</b> <b>really</b> <b>long</b> extension cord." [...] Another comic shows Jon, Garfield, and Odie painting a wall, and Jon yells at Garfield because he's using the end of Odie's tongue as a paintbrush.|$|R
