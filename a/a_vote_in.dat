5|$|A {{permanent}} {{resolution of}} the capital location issue came in 1864. In 1860, the legislature put the question once again to a popular vote. On <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> 1862, no city received the 50 percent minimum required by law. In an 1864 election, Salem received 79 percent and was declared the state capital. The Oregon Constitution lists the seat of state government in Article XIV as Marion County, of which Salem is the seat.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with his}} two Supreme Court appointments, Clinton {{appointed}} 66 judges to the United States courts of appeals and 305 judges to the United States district courts. His 373 judicial appointments are the second most in American history behind those of Ronald Reagan. Clinton also experienced a number of judicial appointment controversies, as 69 nominees to federal judgeships did not receive <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee. In all, 84percent of his nominees were confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{issuance}} of the Churchill White Paper in June 1922, the House of Lords rejected a Palestine Mandate that incorporated the Balfour Declaration by 60 votes to 25, following a motion issued by Lord Islington. The vote proved to be only symbolic as it was subsequently overruled by <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> the House of Commons following a tactical pivot and variety of promises made by Churchill.|$|E

5|$|From 2017-18 onwards, the £9,000 fee cap {{will rise}} with inflation. Maintenance grants are also {{available}} to current students in England, although these are scheduled to cease with the 2016-17 academic year. Maintenance loans are available for living costs, and these are means tested. These loans are scheduled to increase in size for 2016-17, when the maintenance grant system is phased out. There will be <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> the autumn to consider a further increase effective with the 2017-18 year. Several universities have already advertised fees of £9,250 for the year in anticipation of such a vote passing.|$|E
5|$|In May 1923 the Conservative prime minister, Bonar Law, {{resigned}} {{for health}} reasons. In December his successor, Stanley Baldwin, called another election {{in which the}} Conservatives lost their majority, with Labour in a strong second place. King George V advised Baldwin, {{as leader of the}} largest party, not to resign his office until defeated by <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> the House of Commons.|$|E
5|$|On Zelter's {{death in}} 1832, Mendelssohn had hopes of {{succeeding}} him as {{conductor of the}} Sing-Akademie zu Berlin; but at <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> January 1833 he was defeated for the post by Carl Friedrich Rungenhagen. This may have been because of Mendelssohn's youth, and fear of possible innovations; it was also suspected {{by some to be}} attributable to his Jewish ancestry. Following this rebuff, Mendelssohn divided most of his professional time {{over the next few years}} between Britain and Düsseldorf, where he was appointed musical director (his first paid post as a musician) in 1833.|$|E
50|$|In June 2016, Governor John Kasich signed House Bill 523, which {{permits the}} medical use of {{marijuana}} in some cases.

5|$|Opponents of D.C. {{voting rights}} {{propose that the}} Founding Fathers never {{intended}} for District residents to have <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> Congress since the Constitution makes clear that representation must come from the states. Those opposed to making D.C. a state claim that {{such a move would}} destroy the notion of a separate national capital and that statehood would unfairly grant Senate representation to a single city.|$|E
5|$|Philadelphians {{saw three}} ballot {{questions}} in the primary election, all of which involved allowing the city to borrow money. The loans, on the ballot at Clark's urging, were designed to allow the city to temporarily increase spending without raising taxes, and were opposed by many ward leaders in both parties. As a result, they went down to unexpected defeat by a 3:2 margin. Undeterred, Clark and his allies revised and relisted the loans for <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> the general election in November, which would see better turnout and, they believed, {{a better chance of}} success.|$|E

The decision to stop the project was supported by <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> the National Assembly on 6 April 2000.

5|$|Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation {{have criticized}} the Debian project for hosting the non-free {{repository}} and because the contrib and non-free areas are easily accessible, an opinion echoed by some in Debian including the former project leader Wichert Akkerman.

5|$|There {{have been}} a variety of campaigns in other states to select a state dog.

The campaign to make the Siberian Husky the Washington state dog failed in the Washington House of Representatives in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Afroyim v. Rusk, , {{is a major}} United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court ruled that {{citizens}} of the United States may not be deprived of their citizenship involuntarily. The U.S. government had attempted to revoke the citizenship of Beys Afroyim, a man born in Poland, because he had cast <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> an Israeli election after becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen. The Supreme Court decided that Afroyim's right to retain his citizenship was guaranteed by the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. In so doing, the Court struck down a federal law mandating loss of U.S. citizenship for voting in a foreign election—thereby overruling one of its own precedents, Perez v. Brownell (1958), in which it had upheld loss of citizenship under similar circumstances less than a decade earlier.|$|E

5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium is a hardy, herbaceous, rhizomatous, {{perennial}} sedge, able {{to endure}} {{in a variety}} of environments in the temperate, subarctic and arctic regions of Earth. Unlike Gossypium, the genus from which cotton is derived, the bristles which grow on E.angustifolium are unsuited to textile manufacturing. Nevertheless, in Northern Europe, they were used as a substitute in the production of paper, pillows, candle-wicks, and wound-dressings. The indigenous peoples of North America use the plant in cooking and in the treatment of digestive problems. Following <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> 2002, Plantlife International designated E.angustifolium the County Flower of Greater Manchester, as part of its British County Flowers campaign.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to her writing and speaking, Stanton was also instrumental in promoting women's suffrage in various states, particularly New York, Missouri, Kansas, where it was included {{on the ballot in}} 1867, and Michigan, where it was put to <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> 1874. She made an unsuccessful bid for a U.S. Congressional seat from New York in 1866, and she was the primary force behind the passage of the Woman's Property Bill that was eventually passed by the New York State Legislature. She worked toward female suffrage in Wyoming, Utah, and California, and in 1878, she convinced California Senator Aaron A. Sargent to introduce a female suffrage amendment using wording {{similar to that of the}} Fifteenth Amendment passed some eight years previously.|$|E
5|$|On 20 December 1920, the Labor Party Premier, James Dooley, and {{his cabinet}} {{resigned}} after having lost <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> the New South Wales Legislative Assembly a week before. The Governor, Sir Walter Davidson, then commissioned the Leader of the Opposition, Sir George Fuller, as Premier. As Fuller {{did not have}} a majority, he initiated attempts to form a coalition with the Progressive Party. The Progressives split over whether to join the Fuller government into an urban wing, led by Leader Walter Wearne and Deputy Leader Thomas Bavin, which agreed to enter Fuller's coalition and a rural wing ("The True Blues"), led by Bruxner and Ernest Buttenshaw who offered Fuller only conditional support. After seven hours in government, still without a workable majority, Fuller requested a double-dissolution from Davidson. Davidson refused, on the basis that Dooley still had a majority in the lower house, and Fuller resigned.|$|E

Beshear announced that his proposal {{for a constitutional amendment}} to allow for casinos was dead for the regular session on March 27, 2008. Among the other proposals favored by Beshear that failed to pass in the session were an ethics reform measure Beshear proposed {{in the wake of the}} investigation of the Fletcher administration, a plan to reduce the projected shortfall in the state's pension system, and a proposed 70-cent-per-pack tax increase on cigarettes. Besides the state budget, major legislation passed during the session included incentives for homeowners and businesses to utilize energy efficiency measures, anti-bullying legislation, and increased penalties for animal cruelty.|$|E
5|$|The {{rift between}} Williams and Patton became {{permanent}} during negotiations {{over the state}} budget in 1999. Patton proposed to Williams a 7-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax, with 1cent of every 7 dedicated to counties with the most unpaved roads – usually heavily Republican counties ignored by past Democratic governors. Patton claimed Williams {{told him he had}} 10votes in the Senate for the increase. But gas prices spiked before the measure came to <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> the Senate, and Williams failed to deliver his votes after the House passed the tax. The administration and key Republican senators reached a compromise that saved Patton's budget with tax changes that were mostly revenue-neutral. Patton believed Williams had deliberately misled him, however, and the two never reconciled.|$|E
5|$|To achieve full {{political}} control despite not having an absolute majority in parliament, Hitler's government brought the Ermächtigungsgesetz (Enabling Act) to <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> {{the newly elected}} Reichstag. The Act—officially titled the Gesetz zur Behebung der Not von Volk und Reich ("Law to Remedy the Distress of People and Reich")—gave Hitler's cabinet the power to enact laws {{without the consent of}} the Reichstag for four years. These laws could (with certain exceptions) deviate from the constitution. Since it would affect the constitution, the Enabling Act required a two-thirds majority to pass. Leaving nothing to chance, the Nazis used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to arrest all 81 Communist deputies (in spite of their virulent campaign against the party, the Nazis had allowed the KPD to contest the election) and prevent several Social Democrats from attending.|$|E
