5|$|Because Harris was {{the first}} woman {{published}} in science fiction magazines, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> her embrace of female characters and themes, she has been recognized in recent years as a pioneer of women's and feminist science fiction.|$|E

5|$|The {{sperm whale}} was {{designated}} as the Connecticut state animal by the CT General Assembly in 1975. It was selected because of its specific contribution to the state's history <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its present-day plight as an endangered species.|$|E
5|$|Aberdaron {{is noted}} for {{low levels of}} air pollution. The Gwynedd State of the Environment Report in 2004 found levels of sulfur dioxide, {{nitrogen}} dioxide and carbon monoxide very low, and particulates to be low. It {{is one of the}} few sites in the United Kingdom for golden hair lichen, a striking bright orange lichen that is very sensitive to air pollution. The climate is relatively mild <b>and,</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the Gulf Stream, frosts are rare in winter.|$|E
5|$|According to an {{alternative}} theory, {{popular in the}} earlier 20th century and still represented today, the medieval cultures {{in the area of}} modern Poland are not a result of massive immigration, but emerged from a cultural transition of earlier indigenous populations, who then would need to be regarded as early Slavs. This view has mostly been discarded, primarily due to a period of archaeological discontinuity, during which settlements were absent or rare, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> cultural incompatibility of the late ancient and early medieval sites.|$|E

50|$|The Kathmandu Valley {{civilisation}} with Lichhavi {{and then}} Newar settlements grew <b>and</b> prospered <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the fertility of the soil, <b>and</b> later <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the Valley's location along the ancient trade route between India and Tibet. In their wisdom the early settlers set up towns along ridgelines, leaving the fertile slopes for farms.|$|R
5|$|Allen became Jamaica's sixth {{appointed}} governor-general (eighth overall, {{including two}} acting governors-general). He replaced Sir Kenneth O. Hall, who resigned for health reasons. Allen's appointment was controversial {{due to his}} strong ties to the Seventh-day Adventist Church, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> concerns {{that he would be}} unable to attend functions on Saturdays due to his faith's strict observation of the sabbath. Allen resigned from his leadership of the West Indies Union prior to becoming governor-general, however.|$|E
5|$|Although the 77,777 {{copies of}} Advent Pieces: Limited that were {{released}} in Japan sold out {{months in advance}} of the official release date, Last Order received a negative fan response due to changes in content and presentation from the original Final Fantasy VII game, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> this, the crew working on Crisis Core avoided recreating certain scenes from Last Order.|$|E
5|$|Another {{idea was}} the use of split screens, which was born out of the number of phone calls there were, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the element of real time, was used to trace {{parallel}} adventures of different characters, and aid in the connecting of characters. It was used by producers to point the audience to where to pay attention, as secondary stories often take place outside of the main plot. The idea of using boxes came later, which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped inside the box. It was from here that the idea of using split screens as an artistic element came into the series.|$|E

5|$|Another issue {{concerned}} {{the election of}} the president. Few agreed with Madison that the executive should be elected by the legislature. There was widespread concern with direct election, because information diffused so slowly in the late 18th century, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> concerns that people would only vote for candidates from their state or region. A vocal minority wanted the national executive to be chosen by the governors of the states.|$|E
5|$|Because of titanium's {{superior}} {{strength and}} light weight {{relative to other}} metals (steel, stainless steel, and aluminium), <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> recent advances in metalworking techniques, its use has become more widespread {{in the manufacture of}} firearms. Primary uses include pistol frames and revolver cylinders. For the same reasons, it is used in the body of laptop computers (for example, in Apple's PowerBook line).|$|E
5|$|Because {{there are}} no other large cities in the Republic of Macedonia, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{political}} and economical centralisation, a large number of Macedonians living outside of Skopje work in the capital city.

5|$|Blue whale strandings are {{extremely}} uncommon, <b>and,</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the species' social structure, mass strandings are unheard of. When strandings do occur, {{they can become}} the focus of public interest. In 1920, a blue whale washed up near Bragar on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. It had been shot by whalers, but the harpoon had failed to explode. As with other mammals, the fundamental instinct of the whale was to try to carry on breathing at all costs, even though this meant beaching to prevent itself from drowning. Two of the whale's bones were erected just off a main road on Lewis and remain a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|Breech-loading guns {{seemed to}} offer {{important}} advantages. A breech-loader could be reloaded without moving the gun, a lengthy process {{particularly if the}} gun then needed to be re-aimed. The Warriors Armstrong guns also had the virtue of being lighter than an equivalent smoothbore <b>and,</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> their rifling, more accurate. Nonetheless, the design was rejected because of problems which plagued breech-loaders for decades.|$|E
5|$|Complement, an {{important}} component for serology, was first isolated from {{the blood of the}} guinea pig. Guinea pigs have an unusual insulin mutation, and are a suitable species for the generation of anti-insulin antibodies. Present at a level 10 times that found in other mammals, the insulin in guinea pigs may be important in growth regulation, a role usually played by growth hormone. Additionally, guinea pigs have been identified as model organisms for the study of juvenile diabetes <b>and,</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the frequency of pregnancy toxemia, of pre-eclampsia in human females. Their placental structure {{is similar to that of}} humans, and their gestation period can be divided into trimesters that resemble the stages of fetal development in humans.|$|E

5|$|Conventional {{prenatal}} {{tests for}} chromosomal abnormalities such as Down Syndrome rely on analysing {{the number and}} appearance of the chromosomesthe karyotype. Molecular diagnostics tests such as microarray comparative genomic hybridisation test a sample of DNA instead, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> cell-free DNA in plasma, could be less invasive, but as of 2013 it is still an adjunct to the conventional tests.|$|E
5|$|Critics in {{the media}} noted BA's build quality faults, such as {{inconsistent}} gaps between trim sections and joints, although other commentators praised the interior design and craftsmanship. In the used car market, BA Falcons tend to suffer from poor depreciation rates, due to influxes of ex-fleet models entering the second-hand market <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the cost of fuel.|$|E
5|$|Greenway {{suggested}} {{that both the}} French settlers and their slaves ate the Guadeloupe amazon, as well as destroying its habitat. The supposedly related imperial amazon survives in the steep mountain forests of Dominica, whereas Guadeloupe is less mountainous and more suitable for farming, and has a larger population of humans. Because of this, {{there would have been}} a greater pressure on the Guadeloupe amazon, and it appears to have become extinct by the end of the 18th century. The amazons still surviving on the West Indian islands are all endangered since they are trapped for the pet-trade, overhunted for food, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> destruction of their habitat.|$|E
