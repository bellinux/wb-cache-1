40|$|This paper {{examines}} the redistribution of lifetime disposable income generated by small changes to important parameters in Canada's public pension system. These changes represent creeping {{reforms of the}} sort that are routinely implemented through using different indexation formula for different programs or through subtle changes to individual programs. A microsimulation analysis using Statistics Canada's Lifetime Income Pension Policy Simulator (LIPPS) indicates that the distributional consequences of such changes can be significant and counter-intuitive. Indeed, it appears that even pension policy advocacy groups may, on occasion, fail to perceive correctly the impacts of such proposals on their constituents. Such misperceptions can be enough to block potentially beneficial reforms such as <b>automatic</b> mandatory <b>credit</b> splitting in the Canada Pension Plan (CPP). ...|$|R

40|$|The most {{sophisticated}} international systems of environmental certification –such as LEED, BREEM and GREEN STAR, consider building processes and building life cycle. They estimate the building sustainability level {{not only on}} the basis of the “static” performance, but they take into account the “dynamic” process of production, employment and disposal. Therefore, a correct planning methodology should be able to observe the multiplicity of parameters on a horizontal path that gives the same weight to environmental issues, energetic efficiency, construction processes, costs and materials. Making an effort to relate since the beginning the parametric planning with the sustainable approach, and relying on a comprehensive simulation tool may be an effective solution to control the dynamic planning process, optimizing the project in real time. This paper presents the synthesis of a protocol finalized to the sustainable design process including a wide range of aspects (space, energy, environmental rating) and controlling lots of variables. Introduction confronts the ordinary design approach with ours process proposed; Method describes the practical job organization in the BIM ambient; Results defines the work articulation subdivided in 6 phases and, like example, the main first phase structure called Outside; Discussion concludes with the typical LEED credit calculation through the LAC application (Leed <b>Automatic</b> <b>Credit</b> Check), studied for the Allplan parametric software. The LAC - developed by a work team that included designers, technicians and programmers - represents an advanced tool to construct a coherent computerized language which may improve communication between the parts involved in complex building processes, unifying different codes in a single integrated system...|$|E

Jenner himself was mentioned as a preferred candidate for the Supreme Court by Johnson's Secretary of Defense, Clark Clifford, over Johnson's choice, Homer Thornberry. With the impending retirement of Chief Justice Earl Warren, Johnson hoped to elevate Associate Justice Abe Fortas to that post and Thornberry to Fortas' seat. Clifford thought Jenner {{would be a more}} acceptable candidate for Senate Republicans than Thornberry and help make them more amenable to Fortas as Chief Justice.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we look at}} tax credit policy as an {{instrument}} to foster hiring with open-end rather than with fixed-term contracts. In particular, we examine a specific regulation adopted in Italy in the year 2000 (Credito d’Imposta). This policy offers a generous and <b>automatic</b> tax <b>credit</b> to all firms hiring workers with open-end contracts. The eligibility criteria are very mild for both firms and workers. Our results seem to indicate, both formally and empirically, that firms used this subsidy to hire under open-end contracts primarily those workers {{who would have been}} hired under such a contract regardless the subsidy, even though after a short transition into temporary employment. Our estimates suggest that, compared to 2000, in 2001 the subsidy did not increase the overall probability to be hired, but changed the composition of new employees. It increased the chances to find an open-end contract but in a rather uneven way across workers. Conditional on being hired, the probability rose by about 10 per cent for workers holding a college degree, by about 4 per cent for people with a high school diploma, while did no...|$|R

The Fibre Channel core is designed to work with the RocketIO MGT transceivers for the Virtex- 4 FX family and RocketIO GTP transceivers for the Virtex- 5 LXT/SXT families. The Xilinx CORE Generator™ software restricts generating the core to those devices with sufficient resources for the example design. Speed Grade The speed grade for the core is determined by the selected configuration. For Virtex- 4 devices, 4 Gbps operation is only supported in – 11 parts, while all other configurations can be targeted at – 10 parts.

40|$|Behavioral {{studies show}} that people tend to use various {{decision}} heuristics which discard part of the available information, simplify the decision problem, and find a good enough answer. In addition, people’s decision and behavior may change because they learn from experience. This thesis investigates people’s heuristic decision making and learning from experience in two frequent real-world financial decision contexts—credit card repayments and stock trading. Chapter 1 reviews the literature about decision heuristics and nudges. Literature about learning from experience is also reviewed. Chapter 2 shows that <b>automatic</b> minimum <b>credit</b> card repayment as a default nudge has the adverse effect of reducing repayments by allowing card holders to neglect their monthly bill. Chapter 3 examines whether people learn from the negative feedback provided by credit card fees. We show that cardholders tend to adapt to late payment fees, which are typically due to forgetting a repayment, by setting up an automatic repayment. On the other hand, cash advance and over-limit fees are due to card holders’ liquidity needs rather than their mistakes, and thus, they do not learn from experiencing those fees. Our findings are contrast to those in a previous study in the US suggesting that people learn from all three types of fees. Chapter 4 shows evidence of people’s heuristic processing of numerical information {{in the context of}} credit card repayments. We find a strong tendency of card holders repaying at several prominent numbers. We also find people’s preference for round numbers. Conducting an online experiment, Chapter 5 confirms the anchoring effect of numerical information in a credit card bill, as in previous studies, and finds a false consensus bias where people who usually repay only the minimum greatly overestimate the commonness of minimum repayments among others. However, a social nudge phrase in a mock bill fails to correct the false belief, and thus, dose not reduce the likelihood of people repaying only the minimum. Chapter 6 presents a two-stage model of the choice of a stock to sell. Typically investors show a disposition effect, being more likely to sell a stock in gain than loss, other things equal. In our model, investors first decide whether to sell a stock in the domain of gains or losses, and only then, evaluate stocks within the chosen domain. As evidence for the model, our analysis shows that the likelihood of an individual stock being sold is inversely proportional to the number of stocks in the same domain in the portfolio but is not sensitive to the number of stocks in the other domain. Our findings indicate that existing estimation methods of the disposition effect result in substantial biases because those estimations assume that all stocks in a portfolio are simultaneously evaluated across domains of gains and losses. Chapter 7 summarizes the findings and implications of Chapters 2 - 6. Plans and suggestions for future research are also discussed...|$|R
