40|$|Background Drug {{therapy to}} {{maintain}} sinus rhythm {{in patients with}} atrial fibrillation (AF) is limited by adverse effects and inadequate efficacy. There has been an increased interest {{in the use of}} class III drugs to treat AF, and several new agents have been developed, but there is little information available about mechanisms of class III drug action in AF. The present study was designed to compare the effects of two class III agents, d-sotalol and <b>ambasilide,</b> in dog models of experi-mental AF. Methods and Results A previously developed dog model of sustained vagotonic AF was used to assess the ability of equal loading doses of d-sotalol and <b>ambasilide</b> (2 mg/kg, followed by maintenance infusions), to terminate AF and prevent its induction. At this dose, <b>ambasilide</b> terminated AF in 12 of 12 dogs and prevented AF induction in 10 of 12 dogs; d-sotalol terminated AF in 1 of 8 dogs (P=. 001 versus <b>ambasilide)</b> and prevented AF induction in none of 8 dogs (P=. 002). An additional dose of d-sotalol (cumulative load, 8 mg/kg) termi...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the in vitro rate-dependent cellular electrophysiological effects of <b>ambasilide</b> (10 and 20 mu M/l), a new investigational antiarrhythmic agent, in canine isolated ventricular muscle and Purkinje fibers by applying the standard microelectrode technique. At the cycle length (CL) of 1000 ms, <b>ambasilide</b> significantly prolonged the action potential duration measured at 90 % repolarization (APD(90)) in both ventricular muscle and Purkinje fibers. <b>Ambasilide</b> (10 mu M/l) produced a more marked prolongation of APD(90) at lower stimulation frequencies in Purkinje fibers (at CL of 2000 ms = 56. 0 +/- 16. 1 %, n = 6, versus CL of 400 ms = 15. 1 +/- 3. 7 %, n = 6; p < 0. 05), but, in 20 mu M/l, this effect was considerably diminished (15. 2 +/- 3. 6 %, n = 6, versus 7. 3 +/- 5. 1 %, n = 6, p < 0. 05). In ventricular muscle, however, both concentrations of the drug induced an almost frequency-independent lengthening of APD(90) in response to a slowing of the stimulation rate (in 20 mu M/l at CL of 5000 ms = 19. 0 +/- 1. 5 %, n = 91 versus CL of 400 ms = 16. 9 +/- 1. 4 %, n = 9). <b>Ambasilide</b> induced a marked rate-dependent depression of the maximal rate of rise of the action potential upstroke (V-max) (in 20 mu M/l at CL of 300 ms = - 45. 1 +/- 3. 9 %, n = 6, versus CL of 5000 ms = - 8. 5 +/- 3. 9 %, n = 6, p < 0. 05, in ventricular muscle) and the corresponding recovery of V-max time constant was tau = 1082. 5 +/- 205. 1 ms (n = 6). These data suggest that <b>ambasilide,</b> in addition to its Class III antiarrhythmic action, which is presumably due to its inhibitory effect on the delayed rectifier potassium current, possesses I/B type antiarrhythmic properties as a result of the inhibition of the fast sodium channels at high frequency rate with relatively fast kinetics. This latter effect may play an important role in its known less-pronounced proarrhythmic ("torsadogenic") potential...|$|E
40|$|One {{possible}} {{mechanism of}} action of the available K-channel blocking agents used to treat arrhythmias is to selectively inhibit the HERG + MIRP channels, which carry the rapid delayed rectifier outward potassium current (I-Kr). These antiarrhythmics, like sotalol, dofetilide and ibutilide, have been classified as Class III antiarrhythmics. However, {{in addition to their}} beneficial effect, they substantially lengthen ventricular repolarization in a reverse-rate dependent manner. This latter effect, in certain situations, can result in life-threatening polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes). Selective blockers (chromanol 29313, HMR- 1556, L- 735, 821) of the KvLQT 1 + minK channel, which carriy the slow delayed rectifier potassium current GO, were also considered to treat arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation (AF). However, I-Ks activates slowly and at a more positive voltage than the plateau of the action potential, therefore it remains uncertain how inhibition of this current would result in a therapeutically meaningful repolarization lengthening. The transient outward potassium current (I-to), which flows through the Kv 4. 3 and Kv 4. 2 channels, is relatively large in the atrial cells, which suggests that inhibition of this current may cause substantial prolongation of repolarization predominantly in the atria. Although it was reported that some antiarrhythmic drugs (quinidine, disopyramide, flecainide, propafenone, tedisamil) inhibit I-to, no specific blockers for I-to are currently available. Similarly, no specific inhibitors for the Kir 2. 1, 2. 2, 2. 3 channels, which carry the inward rectifier potassium current (I-kl), have been developed making difficult to judge the possible beneficial effects of such drugs in both ventricular arrhythmias and AF. Recently, a specific potassium channel (Kv 1. 5 channel) has been described in human atrium, which carries the ultrarapid, delayed rectifier potassium current (I-Kur). The presence of this current has not been observed in the ventricular muscle, which raises the possibility that by specific inhibition of this channel, atrial repolarization can be lengthened without similar effect in the ventricle. Therefore, AF could be terminated and torsades de pointes arrhythmia avoided. Several compounds were reported to inhibit I-Kur (flecainide, tedisamil, perhexiline, quinidine, <b>ambasilide,</b> AVE 0 118), but none of them can be considered as specific for Kv 1. 5 channels. Similarly to Kv 1. 5 channels, acetylcholine activated potassium channels carry repolarizing current (I-KAch) in the atria and not in the ventricle during normal vagal tone and after parasympathetic activation. Specific blockers Of I-KAch can, therefore, also be a possible candidate to treat AF without imposing proarrhythmic risk on the ventricle. At present several compounds (amiodarone, dronedarone, aprindine, pirmenol, SD 3212) were shown to inhibit I-KAch, but none of them proved to be selective. Further research is needed to develop specific K-channel blockers, such as I-Kur and I-KAch inhibitors, and to establish their possible therapeutic value...|$|E
