In each choice, there is a prototypical solution chosen by the majority, and {{it is tempting to}} offer simplistic explanations of how the minority must be different. She warns that neuroimaging experiments—which as of 2007 were beginning to probe behaviors from mental rotation and facial expressions to grocery shopping and tickling—must strive to avoid such cultural bias and stereotypes.|$|E

500|$|In late 2009, Docter {{noticed his}} pre-teen daughter, Elie, exhibiting similar shyness. [...] "She started getting more quiet and reserved, and that, frankly, {{triggered}} {{a lot of}} my own insecurities and fears," [...] he said. He imagined what happens in the human mind when emotions set in. The idea to depict it through animation excited Docter, who felt it the ideal form to portray [...] "strong, opinionated, caricatured personalities." [...] He began researching information about the mind, alongside Jonas Rivera, a producer, and Ronnie del Carmen, a secondary director. They consulted Paul Ekman, a well-known psychologist who studies emotions, and Dacher Keltner, <b>a</b> <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>psychology</b> <b>at</b> the University of California, Berkeley. Ekman had early in his career identified six core emotions—anger, fear, sadness, disgust, joy, and surprise. Docter found surprise and fear to be too similar, which left him with five emotions to build characters around. Other emotions considered for inclusion during the development process were schadenfreude, ennui, pride, and hope. Keltner focused on sadness being an emotion that strengthens relationships. Both emphasized how emotions organize social lives and the structuring of interpersonal interactions.|$|E

2500|$|Christopher Peterson, <b>a</b> <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>psychology</b> <b>at</b> the University of Michigan, classifies {{the choice}} of toilet paper {{orientation}} under [...] "tastes, preferences, and interests" [...] as opposed to either values or [...] "attitudes, traits, norms, and needs". Other personal interests include one's favorite cola or baseball team. Interests {{are an important part}} of identity; one expects and prefers that different people have different interests, which serves one's [...] "sense of uniqueness". Differences in interests usually lead at most to teasing and gentle chiding. For most people, interests don't cause the serious divisions caused by conflicts of values; a possible exception is what Peterson calls [...] "the 'get a life' folks among us" [...] who elevate interests into moral issues.|$|E

2500|$|Michael Birnbaum, <b>a</b> <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Psychology</b> <b>at</b> California State University, Fullerton, {{has noted}} that the Forer effect is used by magicians and psychics when they give {{so-called}} [...] "cold readings", {{as well as by}} certain TV personalities who claim psychoanalytical expertise and profess to be able to diagnose a guest's psychological problems in a few minutes. [...] "Real psychologists are horrified by this practice", states Birnbaum, but they fail to criticize it vigorously enough in public, and so it continues to be treated with a respect it doesn't deserve. [...] "It is regrettable that academic psychology has not paid more attention to the cold reading technique," [...] Denis Dutton wrote in 1988, [...] "inasmuch as the widespread practice of successful cold reading forms the basis for much of the belief in paranormal powers to be found in society today." [...] While academic psychologists had focused in their studies on students, Dutton called for [...] "analysis of the actual techniques and methods used by proficient cold readers".|$|E

He taught psychology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison (1957–63), during which time he wrote one of his best-known books, On Becoming a Person (1961).
