25|$|In 1984, Apple {{released}} a television commercial which introduced the Apple Macintosh during the telecast of Super Bowl XVIII by CBS, with allusions to George Orwell's noted novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four. The {{goal of the}} commercial was to make people think <b>about</b> <b>computers,</b> identifying the user-friendly interface as a personal computer which departed from prior business-oriented systems, and becoming a signature representation of Apple products.|$|E
25|$|For a decade, colleges had {{required}} {{science and}} engineering majors to take a course in computer programming, typically using the FORTRAN or BASIC languages. This meant there was a sizable customer base who knew <b>about</b> <b>computers.</b> In 1970, electronic calculators were not seen outside of a laboratory, but by 1974 they were a common household item. Calculators and video games like Pong introduced computer power to the general public. Electronics hobbyists were moving on to digital projects such as digital voltmeters and frequency counters. The Altair had enough power to be actually useful, and was designed as an expandable system that opened it up {{to all sorts of}} applications.|$|E
25|$|To {{return to}} the Original Imitation Game, he states only that player A is to be {{replaced}} with a machine, not that player C is to {{be made aware of}} this replacement. When Colby, FD Hilf, S Weber and AD Kramer tested PARRY, they did so by assuming that the interrogators did not need to know that one or more of those being interviewed was a computer during the interrogation. As Ayse Saygin, Peter Swirski, and others have highlighted, this makes a big difference to the implementation and outcome of the test. An experimental study looking at Gricean maxim violations using transcripts of Loebner's one-to-one (interrogator-hidden interlocutor) Prize for AI contests between 1994–1999, Ayse Saygin found significant differences between the responses of participants who knew and did not know <b>about</b> <b>computers</b> being involved.|$|E

500|$|While {{the editor}} of Personal Computer World was on holiday in May 1981, his colleagues publicised the magazine's review of the ZX81 with a cover showing a {{chimpanzee}} with the machine above the strapline [...] "Editor benchtests the ZX81". (The chimp returned in later issues to [...] "benchtest" [...] all of Sinclair's subsequent computers.) The review, which was written by PCW staffer Dave Tebbutt, acknowledged that the machine had significant shortcomings but nonetheless represented [...] "absolutely amazing value for money". He described the ZX81 as [...] "a lovely product which will have enormous appeal to people wanting {{to find out more}} <b>about</b> <b>computers,</b> but without it costing them an arm and a leg" [...] and concluded: [...] "If you know nothing <b>about</b> <b>computers</b> and you want to enjoy finding out about them, then this machine offers a value for money way of doing just that. Children will love the ZX81, there can be no question about that, and I suspect that more than a few people who are already familiar with computers will buy one, just to have a bit of fun." ...|$|E

2500|$|In The Second Self, {{originally}} published in 1984, Turkle writes about how computers are not tools {{as much as they}} are a part of our social and psychological lives. “‘Technology,’ she writes, ‘catalyzes changes not only in what we do but in how we think.’” She goes on using Jean Piaget's psychology discourse to discuss how children learn <b>about</b> <b>computers</b> and how this affects their minds. The Second Self was received well by critics and was praised for being “a very thorough and ambitious study.” ...|$|E

Computer Science, Science and Mathematics Faculty, Sebelas Maret University of Surakarta. Computer {{is just an}} {{electronic}} tools made by human being and will be useless if no one is incapable to operate. Sometimes {{we spend a lot}} of money to fix a computer problem, that is why it is necessary to have an effective media of learning computer. So we can handle computer problems solving effectively. The aim of this final project is to make multimedia video learning and problem solving <b>about</b> <b>computer</b> with flash. Macromedia Flash 8 application is one of multimedia application that can be use to create an interactive application. The making of multimedia start by collecting the data and recording video <b>about</b> the <b>computer,</b> then processes the data into Macromedia Flash 8 to create an interactive multimedia application. This application consist of movie <b>about</b> <b>Computer</b> Hardware Introduction, Computer Problem Solving, Operating Sistem Installation, and Computer Hardware Installation. It can be concluded that multimedia video learning and problem solving <b>about</b> <b>computer</b> with flash has already been created.
