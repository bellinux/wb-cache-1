It consists of a landscaped park with 184 benches facing the Pentagon. When the Pentagon was repaired in 2001–2002, a private chapel and indoor memorial were included, located <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> Flight 77 crashed into the building.|$|E

25|$|Of <b>the</b> men buried <b>at</b> Kellogg's Grove {{only the}} five killed in <b>the</b> second battle <b>at</b> <b>the</b> site were {{originally}} {{buried in the}} grove. Most of the graves were located <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>spots</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> militia men fell. During the 1880s area farmers began a movement to collect those remains and bury them at one spot with a fitting monument, {{which led to the}} 1887 erection of the current stone monument and cemetery <b>at</b> <b>the</b> site.|$|R
5|$|There {{continued}} to be rebellions and resistance to William's rule, but Hastings effectively marked the culmination of William's conquest of England. Casualty figures {{are hard to come}} by, but some historians estimate that 2,000 invaders died along with about twice that number of Englishmen. William founded a monastery {{at the site of the}} battle, the high altar of the abbey church supposedly placed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> Harold died.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} was discovered at about 00:30 on June 3, and Zur's force lost {{the element of}} surprise. The Egyptian position that engaged the Israelis had two companies, but Harpaz, the 51st's 3rd Company's commander, underestimated the force and reported that it contained only one platoon. Zur decided to regroup in the wadi and ordered Aryeh Kotzer's 1st Company to stay and engage the Egyptians <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> they were originally discovered and assault the pillbox there, {{while the rest of}} the forces would try a turning movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{three types}} of {{scrimmage}} kicks are place kicks, drop kicks, and punts. Only place kicks and drop kicks can score points. The place kick is the standard method used to score points, because the pointy shape of the football {{makes it difficult to}} reliably drop kick. Once the ball has been kicked from a scrimmage kick, it can be advanced by the kicking team only if it is caught or recovered behind the line of scrimmage. If it is touched or recovered by the kicking team beyond this line, it becomes dead <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> it was touched. The kicking team is prohibited from interfering with the receiver's opportunity to catch the ball, and the receiving team has the option of signaling for a fair catch. This prohibits the defense from blocking into or tackling the receiver, but the play ends as soon as the ball is caught and the ball may not be advanced.|$|E

25|$|Two weeks later, on 27 May, Catholic {{civilian}} Gerard Duddy (20) {{was killed}} in a drive-by shooting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> Patrick McVeigh was killed. His death was blamed on loyalists.|$|R
5|$|Wilfrid's feast day is 12 October or 24 April. Both dates were {{celebrated in}} early medieval England, but the April date {{appeared}} {{first in the}} liturgical calendars. The April date is the date when his relics were translated to a new shrine. Immediately after his death Wilfrid's body was venerated as a cult object, and miracles were alleged to have happened <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> the water used to wash his body was discarded. A cult grew up at Ripon after his death and remained active until 948, when King Eadred destroyed the church at Ripon; after the destruction, Wilfrid's relics were taken by Archbishop Oda of Canterbury, and held in Canterbury Cathedral. This account appears in a foreword written by Oda for Frithegod's later poem on Wilfrid's life. However, according to Byrhtferth's Vita Sancti Oswaldi, or Life of Saint Oswald, Oda's nephew, Oswald, Archbishop of York, preserved the relics at Ripon and restored the community there to care for them. The two differing accounts are not easily reconciled, {{but it is possible}} that Oswald collected secondary relics that had been overlooked by his uncle and installed those at Ripon. The relics that were held at Canterbury were originally placed in the High Altar in 948, but after the fire at Canterbury Cathedral in 1067, Wilfrid's relics were placed in their own shrine.|$|E

25|$|If the offence fumbles (a ball carrier {{drops the}} football, or has it {{dislodged}} by an opponent, {{or if the}} intended player fails to catch a lateral pass or a snap from centre, or a kick attempt is blocked by an opponent), the ball may be recovered (and advanced) by either team. If a fumbled ball goes out of bounds, the team whose player last touched it is awarded possession <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> it went out of bounds. A fumble by the offence in their own end zone, which goes out of bounds, results in a safety.|$|E
25|$|Since the incident, the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management has {{installed}} additional numerous large {{signs on the}} approaches to Bear Camp Road, warning that the road may be impassable during winter months. Also, the directional sign ("To Gold Beach and Coast") <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> the Kims turned onto the wrong road, has been moved and replaced. At the spot, the through road is narrow and steeply uphill while the side road is much wider and more level {{and appears to be}} the proper continuation. The location and arrow direction on the old sign was confusing and ambiguous, especially in snow when {{it would be impossible to}} see that the narrow uphill road is the correct route while the wide level road is not.|$|E
25|$|On 3 August 1805, , left St Helena as escort of {{a motley}} convoy to England. On 26 September 1805 the convoy {{was in the}} Channel south of the Isles of Scilly when it {{encountered}} a French squadron. It turned out this was Allemand's squadron. Calcutta was forced to strike, but not before she had bought time for the convoy to escape. Moucheron was in the vicinity and sailed {{to the sound of}} the guns. She then proceeded to cruise with Allemand’s squadron, which paid her no attention as she was flying an American flag. Moucheron counted the French ships and then, having completed her reconnaissance, sailed to notify Admiral Lord Cornwallis at Brest. However, by the time Cornwallis arrived <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> Moucheron had left Allemand, he had left.|$|E

25|$|Several factors came {{together}} for Frazier in this fight. He was 27 {{years old and}} at his boxing peak physically and mentally, Ali, 29, was coming back from a three-year absence but had kept active. He had had two good wins, including a bruising battle with Oscar Bonavena, whom Ali had defeated by a TKO in 15 rounds. Frazier worked on strategy with coach Eddie Futch. They noted Ali's tendency to throw a right-hand uppercut from a straight standing position after dropping the hand in preparation to throw it with force. Futch instructed Frazier to watch Ali's right hand and, at the moment Ali dropped it, to throw a left hook <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> they knew Ali's face would be a second later. Frazier staggered Ali in the 11th round and knocked down Ali in the 15th in this way.|$|E
25|$|While {{some of his}} trips (such as to the United States and the Holy Land) were {{to places}} {{previously}} visited by Pope Paul VI, John Paul II became the first pope to visit the White House in October 1979, where he was greeted warmly by then-President Jimmy Carter. He was the first pope ever to visit several countries in one year, starting in 1979 with Mexico and Ireland. He was the first reigning pope {{to travel to the}} United Kingdom, in 1982, where he met Queen ElizabethII, the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. While in Britain he also visited Canterbury Cathedral and knelt in prayer with Robert Runcie, the Archbishop of Canterbury, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> Thomas à Becket had been killed, as well as holding several large-scale open air masses, including one at Wembley Stadium, which was attended by some 80,000 people.|$|E
25|$|The {{house where}} Gavrilo Princip lived in Sarajevo was {{destroyed}} during World War I. After the war, it was rebuilt {{as a museum}} in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia was conquered by Germany in 1941 and Sarajevo {{became part of the}} Independent State of Croatia. The Croatian Ustaše destroyed the house again. After the establishment of Communist Yugoslavia in 1944, the house of Gavrilo Princip became a museum again and there was another museum dedicated to him within the city of Sarajevo. During the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, the house of Gavrilo Princip was destroyed a third time and rebuilt {{for the third time in}} 2015. Prior to 1992 the site on the pavement on which Princip stood to fire the fatal shots was marked by embossed footprints. These were destroyed as a consequence of the 1992–95 war in Bosnia. There is still a plaque in front of the museum <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> Gavrilo Princip stood when he fired the shots.|$|E
