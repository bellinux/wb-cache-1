2500|$|In late 2013 U.S. President Barack Obama made {{recommendations}} to the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues {{as part of his}} $100 million Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative. This Spring discussion resumed in a recent interview and article sponsored by Agence France-Presse (AFP): [...] "It is <b>absolutely</b> <b>critical...</b> to integrate ethics from the get-go into neuroscience research," [...] and not [...] "for the first time after something has gone wrong", said Amy Gutmann, Bioethics Commission Chair." [...] But no consensus has been reached. Miguel Faria, a Professor of Neurosurgery and an Associate Editor in Chief of Surgical Neurology International, who was not involved in the Commission's work said, [...] "any ethics approach must be based upon respect for the individual, as doctors pledge according to the Hippocratic Oath which includes vows to be humble, respect privacy and doing no harm; and pursuing a path based on population-based ethics is just as dangerous as having no medical ethics at all". Why the danger of population-based bioethics? Faria asserts, [...] "it is centered on utilitarianism, monetary considerations, and the fiscal and political interests of the state, rather than committed to placing the interest of the individual patient or experimental subject above all other considerations". For her part, Gutmann [...] believes the next step is [...] "to examine more deeply the ethical implications of neuroscience research and its effects on society".|$|E
40|$|The {{appearence}} of {{the first}} two volumes of the book series "Analecta Husserliana", in 1971 and 1972 respectively, did not evoke particular sensation in the philosophical academy. But the outlook of the founder and editor, Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka, was much wider and more radical. In fact, in her mind, the recent history of phenomenology demonstrated a series of exigencies and opportunities that could not be left unaddressed, without dissipating and ending the new philosophical vitality that it had matured. The radical and original question that Tymieniecka finds herself facing, taking on the Husserlian inheritance, is wether one can proceed beyond the absoluteness of the constituent trascendental consciousness, even while conserving in it those <b>absolutely</b> necessary <b>critical</b> gains that had enabled classical phenomenological thought to unmask the disguises and astuteness of a reason, like that developed from Modernity to our days, pervaded by pressures towards theoretical self-sufficienty and heedless of the drift gradually closer to nihilism. With a renewed phenomenological inquiry Tymieniecka discovered the new position of consciousness: it stands at the center of all-that-which-is-living in force of the human creative act, that constitutes it. In the creative human condition, the autopoiesis of natural constructivism is changed in ontopoiesis. Finally, from such creative human condition, Tymieniecka's thought is able to stretch out towards metaontopoiesis...|$|R

For survival, they surf together and only with other wave riders they <b>absolutely</b> trust (<b>critical</b> life-saving rescues from the tow-in watercraft are commonplace—they take turns piloting the craft—trust is paramount).

40|$|The {{effects of}} the mean {{velocity}} profiles on the instability characteristics in the near-injector region of axisymmetric low density gas jets injected vertically upwards into a high-density gas medium were investigated using linear inviscid stability analysis. The flow {{was assumed to be}} isothermal and locally parallel. Three velocity profiles, signifying different changes in the mean velocity in the shear layer, were used in the analysis. The {{effects of the}} inhomogeneous shear layer and the Froude number (signifying the effects of gravity) on the instability for each set of mean profiles were delineated. At a large Froude number (negligible gravity), a critical density ratio was found for the three profiles at which the jet became <b>absolutely</b> unstable. The <b>critical</b> density ratio for each velocity profile was increased as the Froude number was reduced.
