2500|$|The {{second half}} was {{reported}} to be a [...] "very poor exhibition of football" [...] with substitutes playing at most positions. [...] Michigan's sole points of the second half came on a fumble recovery by William Louis Day. [...] Michigan missed the extra point kicks on its final three touchdowns.

2500|$|By August 2004, Double Fine had {{negotiated}} a new publishing deal with Majesco Entertainment {{to release the}} game on Windows {{as well as the}} Xbox. Tim Schafer was quoted as saying [...] "Together we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> what could conservatively be called the greatest game of all time ever, and I think that's awesome." [...] Though the publishing deal ensured {{they would be able to}} continue the development, Esmurdoc stated they had to forgo plans for hiring new developers to meet the scope of the game as agreed to with Majesco. Subsequently, the studio entered, as described by Esmurdoc, [...] "the most insane crunch I have ever witnessed" [...] in order to complete the game. This was compounded when Majesco announced a PlayStation 2 port to be developed by Budcat Creations in October 2004, which further stretched the availability of Double Fine's staff resources. The game went gold in March 2005; Esmurdoc attributes much of the success of this on the solidarity of the development team that kept working towards this point.|$|E
