5|$|In 1923 J Harlen Bretz {{published}} a paper {{arguing that the}} channeled scablands in Eastern Washington were caused by massive flooding in the distant past. This view, which was seen as <b>arguing</b> <b>for</b> a Catastrophic explanation for the geologic development, which ran counter the then prevailing view of uniformitarianism, and Bretz's views were initially decried. Bretz defended his theories, setting off a forty-year debate over the Missoula Floods before Bretz’s view of a catastrophic flood finally prevailed. Waitt extended Bretz's argument, <b>arguing</b> <b>for</b> a sequence of multiple Missoula Floods — 40 or more. Waitt's proposal was based mainly on analysis from glacial lake bottom deposits in Ninemile Creek and the Touchet Formation deposits in Burlingame Canyon. This represented a move away from a single catastrophic flood toward a series of catastrophic floods, but with the flood source still ascribed to Glacial Lake Missoula.|$|E

5|$|By 1996, various {{prominent}} {{public figures}} were <b>arguing</b> <b>for</b> {{the implementation of}} directly-elected mayors for large UK cities like London. The idea of a London mayor of a Greater London Authority had been included in Labour's 1997 election manifesto, and after their election a referendum was scheduled for May 1998, {{in which there was}} a 72% yes vote with a 34% turnout. With the first mayoral election scheduled for May 2000, in March 1998 Livingstone stated his intention to stand as a potential Labour candidate for the position.|$|E
5|$|He {{argued against}} funding to build Washington, D.C.'s infrastructure, stating {{that it was}} unfair to expect state {{citizens}} {{to pay for the}} city's streets, even if it was the seat of government. He opposed spending money for troops to put down the revolt by the Mormons in Utah Territory, <b>arguing</b> <b>for</b> temporary volunteers as the United States should not have a standing army.|$|E

5|$|Robert died at Jumièges, but {{the date}} of his death is unclear. Various dates are given, with Ian Walker, the biographer of Harold <b>arguing</b> <b>for</b> between 1053 and 1055, but H. E. J.

But for political reasons, German Chancellor Adolf Hitler insisted that the German forces go on the offensive, choosing the Kursk salient for the attack. On 15 April 1943 he authorised preparations for Unternehmen Zitadelle (Operation Citadel).|$|E

5|$|Tara K. Allen, <b>arguing</b> <b>for</b> Alvarado, {{claimed that}} the state court's {{decision}} was objectively unreasonable {{because they did not}} consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the investigation as required by Thompson v. Keohane. Specifically, the considered circumstances of custody were not total because Alvarado's age was not considered. Associate Justice Antonin Scalia responded by saying that, according to Thompson v. Keohane, custody is an objective test and subjective factors like characteristics of the individual do not matter.|$|E
5|$|The {{disappearance}} attracted sustained {{international interest}} and saturation {{coverage in the}} UK reminiscent {{of the death of}} Diana in 1997.

In 2008 they received damages and front-page apologies from Express Newspapers, and in 2011 they testified before the Leveson Inquiry into British press misconduct, lending support to those <b>arguing</b> <b>for</b> tighter press regulation.|$|E
5|$|The second chapter {{examines}} the community's {{conceptions of the}} otherworld, explaining how they approach it through acts of visualisation and altered states of consciousness and their understandings {{of it as a}} realm of spiritual energy connected to dreams and the imagination. Discussing the relationship between anthropology and magic, Greenwood argues that it is impossible for anthropologists to truly understand beliefs regarding magic and the otherworld if they only view it through a western rationalist lens, instead <b>arguing</b> <b>for</b> a phenomenological or relativist perspective that accepts alternative views of the world.|$|E
50|$|The Court heard oral {{arguments}} in March 1985. Wayne Cross <b>argued</b> <b>for</b> Mitsubishi and Benjamin Ramon-Rodriguez for Soler. In addition, Jerrold Joseph Ganzfried was allowed {{some time to}} <b>argue</b> <b>for</b> {{the federal government in}} support of Soler.|$|R

5|$|Various antipopes, however, {{received}} prominent burials, {{including one}} among the papal tombs in Old St. Peter's Basilica (which were destroyed during the sixteenth/seventeenth century demolition). In particular, the conciliar claimants of the Western Schism were entombed in elaborate tombs in important churches by famous sculptors. The tomb of Antipope John XXIII typifies political iconography of antipapal burial, subtly <b>arguing</b> <b>for</b> {{the legitimacy of}} the entombed.|$|E
5|$|Weiquan {{lawyers have}} also {{challenged}} {{the application of}} state secret laws, which are sometimes used to prosecute individuals who disseminate information on politically sensitive issues.

Huang was sentenced {{to three years in}} prison for possession of state secrets.|$|E
5|$|Another shootout {{occurred}} between Henry Clark and Sykes Griffen on December 1, 1878, at Cassidy's Silver Reef Saloon. Although {{it is not}} known exactly what happened, it is believed that Griffen, a faro dealer at the saloon, and Clark, a regular patron, had previously argued over gambling matters. The shooting began when Griffen argued with Clark about a bet they had made. After <b>arguing</b> <b>for</b> several minutes, Griffen pulled a pistol on Clark and shot him. Several witnesses said that Clark pulled a pistol on Griffen and shot him, while other witnesses said that after Clark was shot, other patrons in the saloon, including Clark's father, beat and shot Griffen.|$|E
