2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{recognizable}} landmarks in Ventura was [...] "Two Trees" [...] – two prominent lone trees on a hilltop, visible from most of Ventura. Access to the hill is private property. [...] Signs {{at the bottom of}} the trails and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> themselves warn against trespassing.|$|E
2500|$|From 7 July, {{sessions}} ran intermittently {{through to}} late August. Shankar later told Rolling Stone magazine {{that he wrote}} [...] "Mangalam" [...] at this time: [...] "'Mangalam' came to me while I was walking in Friar Park, George's place, where we were recording. I was looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> and the sky, and feeling very elated all of a sudden, wishing everything should be good for everyone, and it just came to me." ...|$|E

30|$|Diameter, denoted D, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> level {{corresponded to}} breast-height {{diameter}} (1.4  m), while <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bole and log levels, diameter corresponded to <b>the</b> diameter <b>at</b> <b>the</b> base. Velocity, denoted V, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> level corresponded to that {{derived from the}} “time-of-flight” measured on <b>the</b> standing <b>tree,</b> in contrast to resonance velocity <b>at</b> <b>the</b> other two levels. Height, denoted H, corresponded to total <b>tree</b> height <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> level, to bole length <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bole level, and to relative height of the log within <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> (measured from <b>the</b> base of <b>the</b> log) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> log level. The same variable notations were used at each level, being easily discernible from the context.|$|R
30|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> level, {{assumption}} of a site mean value for ρg (Model 2) {{resulted in a}} significant precision gain over the model that assumed ρg of 1, 000 kg m− 3 (Model 1). This assumption effectively removed bias <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> level and reduced the mean absolute error from 10.4 % to 5.59 %. Despite these improvements, there was still considerable error <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> level that was attributable to among-tree variation in ρg. Predictions using Model 2 also showed considerable within-tree bias that was attributable to the large longitudinal variation in ρg not captured by site mean level values in ρg.|$|R

60|$|It {{was truly}} Sylvia. She {{was dressed in}} white, not gray. Her hair was massed upon her head. There was no gray bonnet. She {{looked up at the}} sky, then <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees,</b> and withdrew.|$|E

60|$|Most of the {{soldiers}} had removed their helmets. Some of them had taken their lead suits off, too, and were relaxing comfortably in their cotton uniforms.

6000|$|She did {{not leave}} the room this time, but went to an arrow-slit hard by and gazed out <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> till the {{instrument}} began to speak again.

60|$|They {{walked up}} to the copse without saying a word.

60|$|The house, as I said, was a shell. A {{paint brush}} had not touched it in twenty years.

6000|$|They had {{a charming}} donkey-ride, and, still unsatiated with beauty, Ursula made her mother come out again to wonder <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> {{in the public}} gardens.

60|$|Arthur was {{too much}} preoccupied with the part he was playing himself to be {{thoroughly}} aware of the expression in Adam's face.
