But it's well-acted and well-paced, and it's <b>always</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Hollywood {{point out the}} shallowness of Hollywood life." [...] Lynne Heffley of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "It's predictable as all get-out, but Walters has a nicely understated strength, while brothers Andy and Joey make a likable on-screen team." ...|$|R
5000|$|His {{big break}} came {{ahead of the}} Brumbies clash with the [...] in Brisbane as {{injuries}} to both Sam Carter and Leon Power left head coach Stephen Larkham short on second-row options. As a result, Staniforth was handed a two-week contract to provide injury cover. Surprisingly he found himself named in the starting line-up for the match at Suncorp Stadium which his side won 23-20. He played the first 65 minutes {{of the game and}} put in a credible performance against two experienced Wallabies in the shape of James Horwill and Rob Simmons. Indeed, Horwill was quoted after the game as saying: [...] "He's a guy I imagine will have a big future. It's <b>always</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a young guy come through." ...|$|R
5000|$|Patel {{began to}} teach {{baseball}} in Delhi and in 2011, he helped his village boys {{prepare for the}} second season of the Million Dollar Arm talent hunt for about two months. He did not charge any money. After his return, Patel was also [...] "seriously" [...] practicing the javelin. Patel participated at the national athletics championship in Kolkata in 2011 and the Federation Cup athletics championship in April 2012. In 2012, Patel said, [...] "My family's economical and emotional conditions have improved. I could renovate home {{in the village and}} my sister's wedding was arranged with the money that I sent home. My family gathered self esteem and respect in society. It is <b>always</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> your near and dear ones happy." ...|$|R

25|$|When flying {{visually}} {{the visibility}} is not <b>always</b> <b>good</b> enough <b>to</b> <b>see</b> long distances, so pilots use geographic features to confirm their position {{with what is}} shown on their charts. The Roach flows past Purdeys Industrial Estate, Rochford, which {{is very close to}} the threshold of Runway 24. Pilots returning from a flight north east of the airport would use the Roach to help align themselves with the runway.|$|R
50|$|Supple {{did have}} high praise for Tommy Smith, {{who along with}} Luke Hyam is {{the only member of}} the current squad to have played {{alongside}} him."Tommy was a couple of years younger than me and I trained with him an awful lot. He was very raw when he came over New Zealand."He's a solid lad, a big lad. He wouldn't be a ball-playing defender I suppose, and to be honest I wouldn't have thought he'd be there this long."He's done remarkably well I think to still be there and fair play to him. He was very young when I was there obviously. He's matured since then on the pitch."It's <b>always</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Tommy, whenever I go over to the club he always comes over and has a chat with me. He wouldn't have been the one I thought would've been there that long."Luke Hyam was coming through as well so I know Lukey a little bit, and again he wouldn't have been a standout player back then.|$|R

It 's such a lovely day, all the babies will be out, and it <b>always</b> does me <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them," [...] thought Polly, turning into the wide, sunny street, where West End-dom promenaded at that hour.|$|R
40|$|It is <b>always</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{scientists}} {{engaging in}} philosophical {{reflection on the}} nature and practices of science. It was thus a delight to read Root Gorelick’s (2011) paper in which he attempts to answer the very important question posed in the title: What is theory? Gorelick brings his scientific experience to this question and makes {{a great deal of}} progress on trying to distin-guish theoretical science from the rest. To philosophers of science, this is gold. Philosophers take such philosophical reflections from scientists very seriously. After all, philosophy of science, as I see it, is in the business of understanding and systematising science as it is practiced. When the opportunity arises to read a thoughtful and clearly articulated account of what a working scientist considers to be the distinguishing features of theoretical science, I for one sit up and take notice. I take notice but, as we shall see, I do not necessarily agree. Gorelick's account is interesting and a good point of departure for an informed discussion on the issues in question, but as an account of theoretical science, I am not convinced. Let me, very briefly, draw attention <b>to</b> what I <b>see</b> as some of the shortcomings of Gorelick’s account. After considering a number of alternative accounts, Gorelick settles on hypothesis formation as the mark of theoretical science: Hypothesis formation, where a hypothesis is a simple declarative statement, seems to be an unambiguous definition of theory.

5000|$|In 1997, the Institute of Contemporary Arts {{included}} it {{in their}} Assuming Positions exhibition. The exhibit examined how art could be created {{from a number of}} unexpected sources. Kate Bush, curator of the exhibition, said St George was used because it was [...] "technically brilliant as well as self-knowing": [...] "It starts off dull and builds to a wonderful cinematic climax. You could read it as real laddishness and repugnant xenophobia, {{but at the same time}} you known it knows all that about itself and is a parody. This helps it transcend being an advert and becomes art." [...] Mike Cozens, creative director of Young & Rubicam, praised the advertisement and said [...] "it's been a great hit with punters as well as with advertising juries, which doesn't <b>always</b> follow. It's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> such a mainstream brand like this winning awards for its advertising; it's often more obscure brands that win, which is sometimes questionable." ...|$|R
