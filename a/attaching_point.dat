40|$|The {{abstract}} boundary {{construction of}} Scott and Szekeres provides a `boundary' for any n-dimensional, paracompact, connected, Hausdorff, smooth manifold. Singularities may then {{be defined as}} objects within this boundary. In a previous paper by the authors, a topology {{referred to as the}} <b>attached</b> <b>point</b> topology was defined for a manifold and its abstract boundary, thereby providing us with a description of how the abstract boundary is related to the underlying manifold. In this paper, a second topology, referred to as the strongly <b>attached</b> <b>point</b> topology, is presented for the abstract boundary construction. Whereas the abstract boundary was effectively disconnected from the manifold in the <b>attached</b> <b>point</b> topology, it is very much connected in the strongly <b>attached</b> <b>point</b> topology. A number of other interesting properties of the strongly <b>attached</b> <b>point</b> topology are considered, each of which support the idea that it is a very natural and appropriate topology for a manifold and its abstract boundary.

50|$|Key {{components}} of a cargo hook include the load beam, the keeper, and the <b>attach</b> <b>point.</b> The load beam is the solid piece of metal {{at the bottom of}} a cargo hook that supports the load. Usually it has a curved, narrow end which is used to load a ring, rope, or net onto the hook. The keeper is the locking, spring-operated mechanism that keeps the load from sliding off the load beam during transport. The <b>attach</b> <b>point</b> <b>attaches</b> the hook to the belly of the helicopter, swing system, or longline.|$|R

Additionally, NMR spectroscopy (1 H, DOSY, and HOESY), mass spectrometry (MS), and X-ray diffraction studies revealed that these macrocyclic scaffolds can bind several monoanions with high association constants in DMSO, and are particularly sensitive for the MS detection of anions (with concentrations in the nm range). This anion/receptor interaction involves eight C-H binding sites, which include Csp 2 -H and unusual Csp 3 -H hydrogen-bonding donors...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} showed by Byde {{that it is}} {{possible}} to attach a Delaunay-type end to a compact nondegenerate manifold of positive constant scalar curvature, provided it is locally conformally flat in a neighborhood of the <b>attaching</b> <b>point.</b> The resulting manifold is noncompact with the same constant scalar curvature. The main goal of this paper is to generalize this result. We will construct a one-parameter family of solutions to the positive singular Yamabe problem for any compact non-degenerate manifold with Weyl tensor vanishing to sufficiently high order at the singular point. If the dimension is at most 5, no condition on the Weyl tensor is needed. We will use perturbation techniques and gluing methods. Comment: 40 page...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} an inventory of marine shoreline development throughout Hood Canal and the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca. It also interprets the results on a large scale and for selected smaller areas. Shoreline features were field mapped by boat employing a Global Positioning System to mark positions. Information collected included shoreline features as points (e. g. docks, jetties, launch ramps, etc.) and as lines (bulkheads and backshore landforms) along the shoreline. Data summaries were generated by <b>attaching</b> <b>point</b> and line features to shoreline Geographic Information System layers and grouping these results by drift cells within sub-regions that were, in turn, grouped within larger regions. A total of 595 km of shoreline was mapped, extending from the Union River near Belfair in Lower Hood Canal to Dungeness Spit near Sequim in eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca. Bulkheads were found to cover approximately 18 % of the total mapped shoreline...|$|E

40|$|Lightning <b>Attach</b> <b>Point</b> {{tests were}} {{conducted}} for the space shuttle launch configuration (Orbiter, External Tank and Solid Rocket Boosters). A series of 250 long spark tests (15 to 20 foot sparks) determined that the orbiter may be struck on the nose, windshield brow, tail and wingtips during launch {{but not on the}} main engine nozzles which {{have been shown to be}} vulnerable to lightning damage. The orbiter main engine and SRB exhaust plumes were simulated electrically with physical models coated with graded resistance paints. The tests showed that the exhaust plumes from the SRB provide additional protection for the main engine nozzles. However, the tests showed that the Orbiter Thermal Protection System (TPS), which has also been shown to be vulnerable to lightning damage, may be struck during launch. Therefore further work is indicated in the areas of swept stroke studies on the model and on TPS panels. Further <b>attach</b> <b>point</b> testing is also indicated on the free-flying orbiter.

40|$|Tethered {{spacecraft}} {{are particularly}} {{well suited to}} serve as isolation platforms for space-borne observatories. It has previously been shown that, due to the relatively large tether force, conventional means of performing attitude control for tethered satellites are inefficient for any mission with pointing requirements more stringent than about 1 deg. A particularly effective method of implementing attitude control for tethered satellites {{is to use the}} tether tension force to generate control moments by moving the tether <b>attach</b> <b>point</b> relative to the subsatellite center of mass. This paper presents the development of a precision pointing control algorithm for tethered satellites and the simulation of the control system with laboratory hardware. The control algorithm consists of a linear quadratic regulator feedback law and a Kalman filter. The control algorithm has been shown to regulate the vehicle orientation to within 0. 60 arcsec rms. This level of precision was achieved only after including a mass center estimator and accurately modeling the effects of the nonlinear <b>attach</b> <b>point</b> motion actuator...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the exact {{solution}} for free torsional vibrations of a linearly tapered circular shaft carrying a number of concentrated elements. First of all, the equation of motion for free torsional vibration of a conic shaft is transformed into a Bessel equation, and, based on which, the exact displacement function in terms of Bessel functions is obtained. Next, the equations for compatibility of deformations and equilibrium of torsional moments at each <b>attaching</b> <b>point</b> (including the shaft ends) between the concentrated elements and the conic shaft with positive and negative tapers are derived. From the last equations, a characteristic equation of the form is obtained. Then, the natural frequencies of the torsional shaft are determined from the determinant equation, and, corresponding to each natural frequency, the column vector for the integration constants,, is obtained from the equation. Substitution of the last integration constants into the associated displacement functions gives the corresponding mode shape of the entire conic shaft. To confirm the reliability of the presented theory, all numerical results obtained from the exact method are compared with those obtained from the conventional finite element method (FEM) and good agreement is achieved...|$|E
40|$|An {{electrically}} detonated downhole seismic gun (EDG) {{that will}} fire blank 8 -guage shells underwater has been constructed and tested to 80 m depth (hydrostatic pressures of 130 psi or 8. 9 x 105 Pa). Although other engineering seismic guns which fire blank or projectile sources are available, {{they are for}} near-surface shots and {{are not meant to}} be used for downhold seismic surveys in water-filled boreholes. The EDG was designed primarily for checkshot surveys (well travel-time surveys) and high-quality reflection/refraction tests, but potential applications include shallow vertical seismic profiling and borehole to borehole or borehole to surface tomography, as well as optimum offset and common midpoint seismic reflection surveys. The EDG consists off four steel subassemblies: (1) chamber; (2) breech; (3) pipe; and (4) hanger. A blank 8 -gauge electrical shell is held by the chamber and is detonated by an electrode located inside the breech. O-ring seals prevent water from entering the breech and causing short circuits. The breech is screwed into a pipe which is also fitted with o-ring seals to keep the internal wiring dry. A hanger subassembly provides a convenient <b>attaching</b> <b>point</b> for the hoist cable. Arming of the EDG with an explosives blaster occurs only after lowering to operating depth. The EDG has been tested with various size black powder loads up to 750 grains. Frequency bandwidth and repeatability tests were carried out under saturated conditions in a fluvial and lacustrine sedimentary section. These preliminary tests show significant frequency content in the 25 - 200 Hz band (peak near 100 Hz) for reflections from depths of 150 - 300 m, and acceptable waveform repeatability for different shot records obtained with identical geometry and acquisition parameters...|$|E
40|$|Singularities play an {{important}} role in General Relativity and have been shown to be an inherent feature of most physically reasonable space-times. Despite this, there are many aspects of singularities that are not qualitatively or quantitatively understood. The abstract boundary construction of Scott and Szekeres has proven to be a flexible tool with which to study the singular points of a manifold. The abstract boundary construction provides a 'boundary' for any n-dimensional, paracompact, connected, Hausdorff, smooth manifold. Singularities may then be defined as entities in this boundary - the abstract boundary. In this paper a topology is defined, for the first time, for a manifold together with its abstract boundary.

40|$|We have {{developed}} the visual language compiler-compiler (VLCC) system to automatically generate visual programming environments. VLCC is a grammar based system that can support implementation of any visual language by assisting the language designer in defining the language's graphical objects, syntax, and semantics. The final result of the generation process includes an integrated environment with a visual editor and a compiler for the defined visual language. In VLCC, graphical tools define visual languages to create both graphical objects and composition rules. Visual editors enable language designers to directly and visually manipulate the syntax of these languages. To capture the widest range of visual languages, the VLCC system can be configured for a specific language class. Different language classes can be characterized depending on their graphical objects' structure {{and on the way}} they can be composed. Also, box and arrow diagrams are defined for primitive objects with <b>attaching</b> <b>points</b> and for composition rules to join boxes and arrows at those <b>attaching</b> <b>points.</b> After choosing the visual language type to create, the designer can concentrate on language definition details.
