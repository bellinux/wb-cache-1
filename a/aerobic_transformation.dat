The total polyphenol content of inlet OWW was only moderately reduced (around 50 % decrease of the inlet content) after the biofilter treatment, under the conditions tested. Partial 16 S rRNA genes were amplified using total DNA extracted from the biofilm and separated by TGGE. Sequences of isolated bands were mostly affiliated to the a. -subclass of Proteobacteria, and often branched in the periphery of bacterial genera commonly present in soil (Rhizobium, Reichenowia, Agrobacterium, and Sphingomonas).

Two high laccase-producing fungal strains, Trametes versicolor and Cerrena unicolor, were used in this study as a source of enzyme. Selected dilutions of the mediators significantly increased the activity of extracellular laccase during 14 days of cultivation what was distinctly visible in PAGE technique and in colorimetric tests. The same mediator dilutions increased demethylation properties of laccase, which was demonstrated during incubation of enzyme with veratric acid.

One way in which these compounds can be removed is via aerobic cometabolism, a process that involves oxygenases produced by microorganisms.

Therefore, the aim of this work was to investigate the use of an alkane (pentane) in the <b>aerobic</b> cometabolic <b>transformations</b> of paracetamol, ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, and nimesulide.

40|$|In {{the last}} years, there is {{increasing}} interest in controlling the pollutant emissions of farm techniques. Composting belongs to the recycling techniques for agricultural wastes. Aeration {{is one of the}} most impor-tant factors because composting is basically an <b>aerobic</b> <b>transformation</b> of organic matter. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of aeration on nitrogenous emissions during the composting of turkey and cattle manure as generated by farm-scale management practices: moisture increase, compaction and turning. Around one ton of cattle manure and three tons of turkey manure were composted in six cells for 46 days. The cattle manure was turned or not turned, the turkey manure was either moistened, compacted or stored. Temperature, mass, moisture, carbon and nitrogen content, porosity, bulk density, heap volume and emission of ammonia and nitrous oxide were monitored. The results show that for similar manure the aeration increase induced higher ammonia and nitrous oxide emissions. In the case of cattle manure, the overall nitrogenous emissions were lower than that of turkey manure despite the turning. It was due to the higher carbon availability and the lower nitrogen avai-lability reflected by the higher C:N ratio. Therefore, the management of aeration should take into account the carbon availability in order to con-trol the nitrogenous emissions when composting organic materials with high nitrogen availability...|$|E
40|$|Kinetic {{parameters}} of environmental fate processes are usually inferred by fitting appropriate kinetic models {{to the data}} using standard nonlinear least squares (NLS) approaches. Although NLS is appropriate to estimate the optimum parameter values, it implies restrictive assumptions on data variances when the confidence limits of the parameters must also be determined. Particularly {{in the case of}} degradation and metabolite formation, the assumption of equal error variance is often not realistic because the parent data usually show higher variances than those of the metabolites. Conventionally, such problems would be tackled by weighted NLS regression, which requires prior knowledge about the data errors. Instead of implicitly assuming equal error variances or giving arbitrary weights decided by the researcher, we use an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of the model parameters and the error variances specific for the different species in a model. A study with simulated data shows that IRLS gives reliable results in the case of both unequal and equal error variances. We also compared results obtained by NLS and IRLS, with probability distributions of the parameters inferred with a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) approach for data from <b>aerobic</b> <b>transformation</b> of different chemicals in soil. Confidence intervals obtained by IRLS and MCMC are consistent, whereas NLS leads to very different results when the error variances are distinctly different between different species. Because the MCMC results can be assumed to reflect the real parameter distribution imposed by the observed data, we conclude that IRLS generally yields more realistic estimates of confidence intervals for model parameters than NLS.

40|$|Besides {{tetrachloroethene}} (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE) also 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane (TCA) is {{an important}} contaminant. The results of the analytical monitoring of hydraulic measures at a contaminated site revealed that the concentrations of PCE and TCE are lowered by natural attenuation whereas TCA was recalcitrant. In the R and D-project a technology for the microbial in-situ dagradation of VCH was developed with emphasis {{on the degradation of}} TCA. Under anaerobic conditions a complete comatabolic degradation of TCA could be achieved. 1, 1 -Dichloroethane (DCA) was the only observed metabolite. Chloroethane did not accumulate. The used auxiliar substrat was a mixtur of acetate and formiate or molasses. The transitions of the single environmental phases, 'anaerobaerob' may principally enhance the degradation of the VCH. However, the investigations showed no significant <b>aerobic</b> <b>transformation</b> of TCA or DCA. Methane which may serve as inductor for the aerobic degradation of the VCH is produced under anaerobic conditions. However, the concentrations were not high enough, so that after transition to aerobic conditions the aerobic degradation could not be induced. Although these anaerobic/aerobic transitions are easily to realize for biochemical reasons, they require high amounts of supplements. Because the degradation in in-situ-technologies is limited by mass transfer, no degradation kinetics compared to bioreactors are required. The mineralization of VCH under anerobic conditions is therefore preferable. An extensive monitoring may help to prevent process specific problems (CH_ 4 -gas bubbles, clogging by biomass).

The treatment of textile wastewater is important and has been an issue due to the toxicity of the wastewater and aesthetic impact on water sources. One of the alternatives in treating textile wastewater is by using biological treatment via biological granulation method. Biogranulation treatment strategy based on anaerobic reduction of the azo dyes, followed by <b>aerobic</b> <b>transformation</b> of the formed aromatic amines, holds promise. The biogranulation process of textile dyeing wastewater and its performance in terms of COD and color removal can be influenced by many factors. Among them, substrate (electron donor), redox mediator and aeration time were identified as factors that may give effect on the rate of COD removal and dye degradation process. This research is aimed at optimising these factors. Research was conducted in a batch test with the hydraulic retention time of 24 hours. Glucose, sodium acetate and methanol were used as the different substrates with concentrations of 1000, 2000 and 3000 ppm.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of chlorinated ethene transformation in a streambed was investigated using concentration and carbon isotope data from water samples taken at different locations and depths within a 15 × 25 ms tudy area across which a tetrachloroethene (PCE) plume discharges. Furthermore, it was evaluated how {{the degree of}} transformation is related to groundwater discharge rates, redox conditions, solid organic matter content (SOM) and microbial factors. Groundwater discharge rates were quantified based on streambed temperatures, and redox conditions using concentrations of dissolved redox-sensitive species. The degree of chlorinated ethene transformation was highly variable in space from no transformation to transformation beyond ethene. Complete reductive dechlorination to ethane and ethene occurred at locations with at least sulfate-reducing conditions and with a residence time in the samples streambed zone (80 cm depth) of at least 10 days. Among these locations, Dehalococcoides was detected using a PCR method where SOM contents were > 2 % w/w and where transformation proceeded beyond ethene. However, it was not detected at locations with low SOM, which may cause an insufficient H 2 supply to sustain a detectably dense Dehalococcoides population. Additionally, {{it is possible that}} other organisms are responsible for the biodegradation. A microcosm study with streambed sediments demonstrated the potential of VC oxidation throughout the site even at locations without a pre-exposure to VC, consistent with the detection of the epoxyalkane:coenzyme M transferase (EaCoMT) gene involved in the degradation of chlorinated ethenes via epoxidation. In contrast, no <b>aerobic</b> <b>transformation</b> of cDCE in microcosms over a period of 1. 5 years was observed. In summary, the study demonstrated that carbon isotope analysis is a sensitive tool to identify the degree of chlorinated ethene transformation even in hydrologically and geochemically complex streambed systems.

Except for 2, 2 ′, 5, 5 ′-tetrachlorobiphenyl, BPDOB 356 transformed each congener at a higher rate than BPDOLB 400. The assays used either whole cells or purified enzymes and either individual congeners or mixtures of congeners. Product analyses established previously unrecognized BPDOB 356 activities, including the 3, 4 -dihydroxylation of 2, 6 -dichlorobiphenyl. BPDOLB 400 had a greater apparent specificity for biphenyl than BPDOB 356 (kcat/Km = 2. 4 × 106 ± 0. 7 × 106 M− 1 s− 1 versus kcat/Km = 0. 21 × 106 ± 0. 04 × 106 M− 1 s− 1). However, the latter transformed biphenyl at a higher maximal rate (kcat = 4. 1 ± 0. 2 s− 1 versus kcat = 0. 4 ± 0. 1 s− 1). A variant of BPDOLB 400 containing four active site residues of BPDOB 356 transformed para-substituted congeners better than BPDOLB 400. Interestingly, a substitution remote from the active site, A 267 S, increased the enzyme's preference for meta-substituted congeners. Moreover, this substitution had a greater effect on the kinetics of biphenyl utilization than substitutions in the substrate-binding pocket. In all variants, the degree of coupling between congener depletion and O 2 consumption was approximately proportional to congener depletion. At 2. 4 -Å resolution, the crystal structure of the BPDOB 356 - 2, 6 -dichlorobiphenyl complex, the first crystal structure of a BPDO-PCB complex, provided additional insight into the reactivity of this isozyme with this congener, as well as into the differences in congener preferences of the BPDOs...|$|E

In this paper, the role and application of bacteria in anaerobic and <b>aerobic</b> sulfur <b>transformations</b> are described and exemplified for the treatment of a paper mill wastewater. The sulfate containing wastewater first passes an anaerobic UASB reactor for bulk COD removal which is accompanied by the formation of biogas and hydrogen sulfide.

We use {{the framework of a}} general model of fractal-like distribution networks together with data on energy transformation in mammals to analyze and predict allometric scaling of aerobic metabolism over a remarkable 27 orders of magnitude in mass encompassing four levels of organization: individual organisms, single cells, intact mitochondria, and enzyme molecules. We show that, whereas rates of cellular metabolism in vivo scale as M− 1 / 4, rates for cells in culture converge to a single predicted value for all mammals regardless of size. Furthermore, a single three-quarter power allometric scaling law characterizes the basal metabolic rates of isolated mammalian cells, mitochondria, and molecules of the respiratory complex; this overlaps with and is indistinguishable from the scaling relationship for unicellular organisms. This observation suggests that <b>aerobic</b> energy <b>transformation</b> at all levels of biological organization is limited by the transport of materials through hierarchical fractal-like networks with the properties specified by the model. We show how the mass of the smallest mammal can be calculated (≈ 1 g), and the observed numbers and densities of mitochondria and respiratory complexes in mammalian cells can be understood.

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 The <b>aerobic</b> <b>transformation</b> of TCE and cis-DCE by a tetrabutoxysilane-grown {{microorganism}} (Vancheeswaran et al., 1999) led to {{the investigation}} of novel substrates, including benzyl alcohol, for promoting cometabolism. The culture grew on carboxylic compounds and alcohols, but did not grow on formate, methanol, methane, propane, butane, ethylene, benzene, toluene, or p-xylene. Cis-DCE transformation was observed when the culture grew on butyrate, glucose, 1 -propanol, 1 -butanol, ethanol, benzyl alcohol, and phenol, and effectively transformed TCE, cis-DCE, and vinyl chloride when grown on phenol or benzyl alcohol. Several cycles of growth on benzyl alcohol led to increases in TCE transformation rates and transformation capacities. Products of benzyl alcohol degradation shifted from benzaldehyde to 2 -hydroxy benzyl alcohol (2 HBA) during the several cycles of growth. In resting cells studies, 2 HBA production rates were highly correlated with TCE transformation rates. TCE transformation and 2 HBA production rates doubled when the culture was grown on phenol and rates of TCE transformation were correlated with 2 HBA production rates. Benzyl alcohol- and phenol-grown cells oxidized toluene to o-cresol, which indicated the similarity between benzyl alcohol ortho-monooxygenase, phenol hydroxylase, and toluene ortho-monooxygenase. 2 -Butyne and 1 -hexyne (but not acetylene) inhibited benzyl alcohol- and phenol-grown cells similarly, indicating the same ortho-monooxygenase was responsible for TCE cometabolism. Resting cell kinetic studies were performed with cells grown on phenol or benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol degradation followed a Monod kinetics while phenol degradation followed a Haldane kinetics. The maximum transformation rates (k[subscript max]) of TCE, cis-DCE, and VC achieved by phenol-grown cells were about a factor of two higher than achieved with benzyl alcohol-grown cells, while the half-saturation constants (K[subscript s]) were in a similar range. Transformation capacities (Tc) for TCE, cis-DCE, and VC were about a factor of two to four higher with phenol-grown cells. The modeling of TCE, cis-DCE, and VC transformation using independently measured k[subscript max] and K[subscript s] values matched well with observed data from batch tests. Benzyl alcohol was shown {{to be an effective}} novel substrate for the aerobic cometabolism of TCE, cis-DCE, and vinyl chloride.

Within 33 h, both isolates degraded 100 % of 2 -NSA in MSM and also 2 -NSA in non-sterile tannery wastewater. The yield coefficient was 0. 33 g biomass dry weight per gram of 2 -NSA. A conceptual model, which describes the <b>aerobic</b> <b>transformation</b> of organic matter, was used for interpreting the biodegradation kinetics of 2 -NSA. The half-lives for 2 -NSA, at initial concentrations of 100 and 500 mg/l in MSM, ranged from 20 h (2 AC) to 26 h (4 BC) with lag-phases of 8 h (2 AC) and 12 h (4 BC). The carbon balance indicates that 75 - 90 % of the initial TOC (total organic carbon) was mineralized, 5 - 20 % remained as DOC (dissolved organic carbon) and 3 - 10 % was biomass carbon. The principal metabolite of 2 -NSA biodegradation (in both MSM and tannery wastewater) produced by Comamonas sp. 4 BC had a MW of 174 and accounted for the residual DOC (7. 0 - 19. 0 % of the initial TOC and 66 % of the remaining TOC). Three to {{ten percent of the}} initial TOC (33 % of the remaining TOC) was associated with biomass. The metabolite was not detected when Arthrobacter sp. 2 AC was used, and a lower residual DOC and biomass carbon were recorded. This suggests that the two strains may use different catabolic pathways for 2 -NSA degradation. The rapid biodegradation of 2 -NSA (100 mg/l) added to non-sterile tannery wastewater (total 2 -NSA, 105 mg/l) when inoculated with either Arthrobacter 2 AC or Comamonas 4 BC showed that both strains were able to compete with the indigenous microorganisms and degrade 2 -NSA even in the presence of alternate carbon sources (DOC in tannery wastewater = 91 mg/l).

In the present study, the significant upregulation of the four BDE 209 degradation genes confirmed the debromination, hydroxylation and ring opening process of BDE 209 degradation by strain WZN- 1. The functional annotation of the genome showed that the hydrolase gene is an alpha/beta hydrolase in NR database. The KEGG database suggested this gene is dhaA haloalkane dehalogenase, and has xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism function. The dioxygenase gene in strain WZN- 1 was identified as an aromatic ring-opening dioxygenase via COG database, which suggested the potential ring opening ability of strain WZN- 1. Moreover, the dehalogenase gene 1 and dehalogenase gene 2 were identified as haloacid dehalogenases of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia from the NR database. Previous study showed that enzymes were involved in the PCB degradation, transport processes, energetic metabolism, electron transport, and carbon metabolism(Zhang et al. 2014). Dioxygenase enzymes are responsible for degradation of diphenyl ether and may be responsible for degradation of less brominated PBDEs (Lee et al. 2011). Additionally, the 2 D electrophoresis (2 -DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) were used to identify upregulated proteins during PCB degradation, genes encoding for dioxygenase, ABC transporters, transmembrane proteins, electron transporter, and energetic metabolism proteins were significantly upregulated. Similarly, Tang et al. also suggested that enzymes and genes might act as functional protein in BDE 209 biodegradation, ATP synthase and ABC transporter permease {{played a critical role in}} BDE 209 transport from extracellular environment to intracellular cells (Tang et al. 2016). Besides the four identified BDE 209 degradation genes, we also found twelve of ATP synthases, thirty-six of ABC transporter permeases, nineteen of hydroxylases, and sixty-five of oxygenase in strain WZN- 1 (data not shown), which indicates that there may more genes involved in the biodegradation of BDE 209 by strain WZN- 1.|$|R
40|$|Enterobacter cloacae strain EM was {{isolated}} from a commercial dietary mineral supplement stabilized by {{a mixture of}} methylparaben and propylparaben. It harbored a high-molecular-weight plasmid and was resistant to high concentrations of parabens. Strain EM was able to grow in liquid media containing similar amounts of parabens as found in the mineral supplement (1, 700 and 180 mg of methyl and propylparaben, respectively, per liter or 11. 2 and 1. 0 mM) and in very high concentrations of methylparaben (3, 000 mg liter− 1, or 19. 7 mM). This strain was able to hydrolyze approximately 500 mg of methyl-, ethyl-, or propylparaben liter− 1 (3 mM) in less than 2 h in liquid culture, and the supernatant of a sonicated culture, after a 30 -fold dilution, was able to hydrolyze 1, 000 mg of methylparaben liter− 1 (6. 6 mM) in 15 min. The first step of paraben degradation was the hydrolysis of the ester bond to produce 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid, followed by a decarboxylation step to produce phenol under <b>aerobic</b> conditions. The <b>transformation</b> of 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid into phenol was stoichiometric. The conversion of approximately 500 mg of parabens liter− 1 (3 mM) to phenol in liquid culture was completed within 5 h without significant hindrance {{to the growth of}} strain EM, while higher concentrations of parabens partially inhibited its growth...|$|R
40|$|Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) {{are used}} to impart oil- and water-repellant and {{surfactant}} properties to numerous products, and {{they are among the}} most persistent chemicals to ever enter commerce. PFAAs are detected in the blood of humans all over the world. The two 8 -carbon PFAAs, perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), have been associated with a number of adverse health outcomes. Compounds capable of transforming to PFAAs, known as PFAA precursors, are a potentially important but poorly-understood source of indirect PFAA exposure. Unlike the PFAAs, there are many types of PFAA precursors, some of which are not publically known, and analytical standards for their measurement are often unavailable. Thus, a central challenge to characterizing PFAA precursor occurrence is a lack of available analytical tools to measure them. In this research, a new oxidation-based technique of PFAA precursor measurement was developed for aqueous and solid samples. Along with other analytical tools, this precursor assay was used to gain insight into the occurrence and fate of PFAA precursors in two sources: urban runoff and soil and groundwater impacted by firefighting materials known as aqueous film forming foams (AFFF). The occurrence of PFAA precursors in urban runoff was investigated {{to determine the extent to}} which runoff could serve as a source of PFAAs to drinking water supplies during storage in aquifers or reservoirs. An indirect technique of measuring PFAA precursors was developed for urban runoff samples by exposing samples to a high concentration of hydroxyl radicals and converting precursors to measureable perfluorinated carboxylate products (Chapter 2). By comparing perfluorinated carboxylate concentrations before and after oxidation, the total concentration of PFAA precursors was inferred. Analysis of thirty-three urban runoff samples collected from locations around the San Francisco Bay, CA indicated that C 8 forms of PFAAs and C 6 forms of PFAA precursors were predominant in runoff. The assay demonstrated that commonly measured PFAA precursors represented only a small fraction (< 25 %) of the total concentration of precursors present in runoff, confirming the utility of the precursor assay. To assess the persistence of AFFF-derived PFAA precursors, groundwater, soil, and aquifer solids were obtained in 2011 from an unlined firefighter training area at a U. S. Air Force Base where AFFF was regularly used between 1970 and 1990 (Chapter 3). To measure the total concentration of PFAA precursors in archived AFFF formulations and AFFF-impacted environmental samples, the oxidation-based assay developed in Chapter 2 was adapted for these media. This precursor assay was employed along with direct measurement of twenty-two precursors found in AFFF and a suite of other poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). On a molar basis, precursors accounted for 41 % to 100 % of the total concentration of PFASs in archived AFFF formulations. In the training area, precursors measured by the precursor assay accounted for an average of 23 % and 28 % of total PFASs in groundwater and solids samples, respectively. Thus, much of the mass of precursors released at the site appeared to be converted to perfluorinated carboxylates and sulfonates over a residence time of twenty years or more. One precursor in AFFF, perfluorohexane sulfonamide amine, was detected at low concentrations on several highly contaminated soil and aquifer solids samples, but no other precursors also measured in AFFF formulations were detected in any samples at this field site. Suspected intermediate transformation products of precursors in AFFF that were directly measured accounted for approximately half of the total precursor concentration in samples from the training site. In order to elucidate the conditions most amenable to AFFF-derived PFAA precursor transformation, microcosms were constructed with soil and sediment inocula and were incubated under different redox conditions with two different types of AFFF (Chapter 4). Live microcosms amended with AFFF manufactured by 3 M demonstrated an ability to utilize the carbon in AFFF, but no changes in PFAS concentrations were observed over 60 - to 90 -day incubation periods. The main precursor in AFFF manufactured by Ansul, 6 : 2 fluorotelomer thioamido sulfonate (6 : 2 FtTAoS), was transformed in both aerobic and anaerobic live incubations. Under aerobic conditions, three amendments of 6 : 2 FtTAoS were completely transformed over a 90 -day incubation and 8 % of the 6 : 2 FtTAoS loss was accounted for as perfluorinated carboxylate and fluorotelomer sulfonate transformation products. Two additional <b>aerobic</b> <b>transformation</b> products containing one or two oxygen additions to 6 : 2 FtTAoS were also identified. Transformation was much slower under all anaerobic conditions, with complete transformation of 6 : 2 FtTAoS under live nitrate-reducing conditions after 200 days of incubation and 45 % to 71 % transformation of 6 : 2 FtTAoS after 320 days of incubation under sulfate-reducing, iron-reducing, and methanogenic conditions. A transformation product not observed under aerobic conditions, a carboxylate hydrolysis product of the 6 : 2 FtTAoS amide group, was identified under all anaerobic conditions. Application of the precursor assay to microcosm slurries suggested that all unquantifiable biological transformation products under aerobic conditions were partitioned to the microcosm slurry. In the anaerobic microcosms, the precursor assay indicated that unidentified biological transformation products were either sufficiently volatile to leave the slurry or unable to be oxidized to perfluorinated carboxylates. Transformation products reported in soil and groundwater beneath many U. S. military firefighter training areas (Chapter 3) are consistent with the <b>aerobic</b> <b>transformation</b> products observed in Ansul AFFF-amended microcosm...|$|E
30|$|PBT/vPvB {{assessment}} became {{legally binding}} {{with the release}} of REACH [23], which laid down the persistence criteria from the TGD [26] plus a half-life in soil of 120  days, which is shorter than in the international agreements. Again, the relevant temperature (and other environmental conditions) for testing persistence was not defined in the regulation. In the first version of the Guidance in Information and Chemical Safety Assessment Chapter R. 11 [12], nothing is said on the relevant temperature for persistence testing. In version 2.0 of the Guidance Chapter R. 11 [15], one sentence relates to temperature: “Please note that since its 32 nd meeting the Member State Committee has started to require new simulation degradation studies to be carried out around neutral pH values and at 12  °C, which is understood as the mean temperature of European surface waters”. The draft version 4.0 of the Guidance Chapter R. 7 b Endpoint specific guidance [16] states that “New simulation studies should be conducted at environmentally relevant temperatures namely at 12  °C as this is seen as the average surface water temperature for the European Union (9  °C for sea water). If information on degradation half-life is already available from existing simulation degradation tests performed at a higher temperature, they should be normalised to a half-life corresponding to 12  °C by using the Arrhenius equation”. A generic activation energy of 65.4  kJ mol− 1 is proposed which has been derived by EFSA [19] (see below). The draft version 3.0 of the Guidance Chapter R. 11 PBT/vPvB assessment [17] refers to this statement. Simulation degradation studies should be performed according to the OECD guidelines no. 307 for aerobic degradation in soil [37], no. 308 for anaerobic and <b>aerobic</b> <b>transformation</b> in water and sediment [38] and no. 309 for aerobic mineralisation in surface water [39]. However, Honti and Fenner [30] concluded that available OECD 308 data are insufficient to derive persistence indicators that had both acceptable robustness and uncertainty. Rauert et al. [42] proposed “…normalising DegT 50 values to 12  °C because this temperature is established or suggested under the majority of frameworks (i.e. Biocides Regulation, REACH and medicinal products Directives)”. However, the guidance for PBT/vPvB assessment is the same for the three mentioned frameworks. For PPP, DG [10] stated in its Working Document on “Evidence needed to identify POP, PBT and vPvB Properties for Pesticides”: “Laboratory studies: DT 50 values should be normalised to a temperature of 20  °C, as this is the current practice in recent assessments of soil degradation rates of active substances”. This Working Document has been applied for the initial establishment of the list of candidates for substitution [11] as required in Article 80 [7] of Regulation (EC) No 1107 / 2009 [24], i.e. half-lives at 20  °C have been considered when the list was compiled.|$|E
40|$|Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are {{naturally}} competent, but limited information {{exists on the}} impact of environmental conditions on transformation. In this study, we investigated the impact of temperature and microaerobic versus <b>aerobic</b> atmosphere on <b>transformation</b> of C. coli to erythromycin and nalidixic acid resistance. Frequency of transformation was not significantly different between microaerobic (5 to 10 % CO 2) and aerobic conditions. However, C. coli was transformed to erythromycin resistance at a significantly higher frequency at 42 °C than at 25 °C (P < 0. 05), and few or no transformants were obtained at 25 °C. In contrast, transformation to nalidixic acid resistance was highly efficient at both 42 °C and 25 °C and was similar or, at the most, fourfold higher at 42 °C than at 25 °C. DNase I treatment experiments suggested that steps both prior and subsequent to internalization of DNA were influenced by temperature in the case of transformation of C. coli to erythromycin resistance. However, the moderately increased (fourfold) frequency of transformation to nalidixic acid resistance at 42 °C compared to that at 25 °C was exclusively associated with steps prior to DNA internalization. These findings suggest that transformation to erythromycin resistance may be significantly more frequent in the gastrointestinal tract of hosts such as poultry (at 42 °C) than in other habitats characterized by lower temperatures, whereas transformation to nalidixic acid resistance may be highly efficient both within and outside the animal hosts...|$|R
30|$|The {{dominant}} form of N was the {{nitrate nitrogen}} (NO 3 -N); however, its {{level in the}} cultivated soils was substantially {{higher than in the}} controls and ranged between 2.99  ±  0.03 and 27.17  ±  0.14  mg kg− 1; in turn, in the controls it was lower by 44 – 62.5  % and remained in the range of 1.68  ±  0.01 – 10.20  ±  0.11  mg kg− 1. The dominance of nitrate nitrogen in the agricultural soils, especially during the spring season (soils were extracted in April 2014), {{can be explained by the}} fact that agricultural practices such as fertilization, particularly those performed after winter time (early spring), stimulate <b>aerobic</b> N <b>transformation,</b> resulting in nitrification of NH 4 -N (Campos 2010), and indirectly influence microbial activity. Booth et al. (2006) mentioned that NO 3 -N production and consumption in tilled soils are mediated more by TC and less than by the direct effects of disturbance; this is because as labile carbon is respired away, heterotrophs become less competitive and nitrifiers more competitive for NH 4 -N, resulting in increases in the size of the NO 3 -N pool. Two other forms of nitrogen (NH 4 -N and NO 2 -N) achieved the following values in the agricultural managed soils: 0.012  ±  0.06 – 0.431  ±  0.05 and 0.036  ±  0.05 – 0.116  ±  0.01  mg kg− 1 for NH 4 -N and NO 2 -N, respectively. In contrast, the amounts of ammonium and nitrite nitrogen in the non-cultivated soils were even threefold–tenfold higher than those noted in the agricultural soils, and oscillated between 0.041  ±  0.01 and 4.938  ±  0.08  mg kg− 1 in the case of NH 4 -N and from 0.102  ±  0.01 to 0.866  ±  0.03  mg kg− 1 for NO 2 -N. Our results are in agreement with other studies showing variations in inorganic nitrogen, depending on land use (Banach et al. 2009; Campos 2010). However, the investigations by Campos (2010) were not strictly connected with arable soils, which were the subject in the current study, but related to tropical cloud forest, grassland, and coffee crop. Undoubtedly, the higher N richness noted in the cultivated soils is associated with continuous nitrogen fertilization thereof. This is consistent with the results of Li and Lang (2014) indicating a similar trend noted in uncultivated and cultivated black soil. Comparable findings were presented by Zhang et al. (2013) for woodland and agricultural soils. It should also be pointed that a high level of N fertilization can drive soil acidification (Guo et al. 2010) and modify the population numbers of soil microorganisms and availability of nutrients (Wolińska et al. 2014), which is the cause of differentiation of biological activity as an effect of agricultural management. Bach et al. (2012) indicated that grassland restoration on clay loam soils increases microbial biomass C and N, improves soil structure, and promotes soil C accrual.|$|R
40|$|Heterotrophic {{bacteria}} and fungi are {{widely recognized as}} crucial mediators of carbon, nutrient, and energy flow in ecosystems, yet information on their total annual production in benthic habitats is lacking. To assess the significance of annual microbial production in a structurally complex system, we measured production rates of {{bacteria and}} fungi over an annual cycle in four aerobic habitats of a littoral freshwater marsh. Production rates of fungi in plant litter were substantial (0. 2 to 2. 4 mg C g− 1 C) but were clearly outweighed by those of bacteria (2. 6 to 18. 8 mg C g− 1 C) throughout the year. This indicates that bacteria represent the most actively growing microorganisms on marsh plant litter in submerged conditions, a finding that contrasts strikingly with results from both standing dead shoots of marsh plants and submerged plant litter decaying in streams. Concomitant measurements of microbial respiration (1. 5 to 15. 3 mg C-CO 2 g− 1 of plant litter C day− 1) point to high microbial growth efficiencies on the plant litter, averaging 45. 5 %. The submerged plant litter layer together with the thin aerobic sediment layer underneath (average depth of 5 mm) contributed the bulk of microbial production per square meter of marsh surface (99 %), whereas bacterial production in the marsh water column and epiphytic biofilms was negligible. The magnitude of the combined production in these compartments (∼ 1, 490 g C m− 2 year− 1) {{highlights the importance of}} carbon flows through microbial biomass, to the extent that even massive primary productivity of the marsh plants (603 g C m− 2 year− 1) and subsidiary carbon sources (∼ 330 g C m− 2 year− 1) were insufficient to meet the microbial carbon demand. These findings suggest that littoral freshwater marshes are genuine hot spots of <b>aerobic</b> microbial carbon <b>transformations,</b> which may act as net organic carbon importers from adjacent systems and, in turn, emit large amounts of CO 2 (here, ∼ 870 g C m− 2 year− 1) into the atmosphere...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 Biyokimyasal olarak zor ayrışan, arıtmaya karşı dirençli, toksik ve/veya mutajenik etkileri olan bazı endüstriyel kirleticilerin su kaynaklarımızdaki varlığı ekosistemleri tehdit etmektedir. Endokrin bozucu özellikleri olduğu bilinen ve noniyonik yüzey aktif maddelerin bileşiminde bulunan alkil fenol polietoksilat metabolitlerinin konvansiyonel fiziksel, biyolojik ve kimyasal arıtma yöntemleri ile giderimleri yetersiz kalmaktadır. Bu nedenle alkil fenol polietoksilatların ve alkil fenollerin ileri oksidasyon prosesleri gibi ileri arıtma yöntemleri ile giderim çalışmaları ve uygulamaları son yıllarda önem kazanmıştır. İleri oksidasyon prosesleri arasında hızları ve yüksek giderim verimleri nedeniyle Fenton, Fenton-benzeri ve Foto-Fenton proseslerinin atıksu ve su arıtımında sorunlu kirleticilerin oksidasyonu için tercih edilmektedir. Son yıllarda ekonomik, kolay uygulanabilir ve etkin olması nedeniyle hidrojen peroksit ve persülfat gibi oksidanlarla aktive edilebilen sıfır değerlikli demir ile arıtma prosesleri dikkat çekmektedir.   Yukarıdaki bilgiler ışığında bu tez kapsamında, bir oktil fenol polietoksilat bileşiği olan noniyonik bir yüzey aktif maddenin (ticari ismi: Triton X- 45), persülfat (S 2 O 82 -) iyonları ile aktive edilmiş sıfır değerlikli demir kullanılarak arıtımı incelenmiştir. Yüzey aktif maddenin Persülfat/Sıfır değerlikli demir ileri oksidasyon sistemi ile arıtılabilirliği üç aşamada çalışılmıştır. Birinci aşamada, prosesi etkileyen parametrelerin (katalizör konsantrayonu, oksidan konsantrasyonu, pH, arıtma süresi) oksidasyon verimi üzerindeki etkileri araştırılmış, yüzey aktif madde (20 mg/L sulu çözelti) ve TOK giderimi bazında {{optimize}} edilmiştir. En uygun pH değeri 5, optimum persülfat konsantrasyonu 2. 5 mM, optimum katalizör konsantrasyonu 1 g/L, optimum arıtma süresi 60 dk. olarak belirlenmiştir. Çalışmanın ikinci aşamasında arıtma sisteminin ekotoksikolojik etkilerini incelemek üzere seçilen deneysel koşullarda arıtılmış numunelerde akut toksisite testleri gerçekleştirilmiştir. Toksisite biyodeneylerinde test organizmaları olarak Vibrio fischeri fotobakterileri ve bir tatlısu mikroalgi olan Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata kullanılmıştır. Yapılan deneysel çalışmalar neticesinde, belirlenen en uygun arıtma koşullarında OPEO’ nun % 95 TOK’un ise % 40 oranında giderimi sağlanmıştır. Vibrio fischeri ve Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata ile yürütülen akut toksisite deneyleri ile 120 dakikalık reaksiyon süresi sonucunda % bağıl toksisite değerleri Vibrio fischeri için % 66 ’dan % 20 ’ye düşürülmüş, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata için ise % 16 olan bağıl toksisite tamamen giderilmiştir. Surfactants are {{organic chemicals}} that reduce surface tension {{in water and}} other liquids. The most familiar use for surfactants are soaps, laundry detergents, dishwashing liquids and shampoos. They are {{a diverse group of}} chemicals with unique cleaning and/or solubilisation properties. They usually consist of a polar (hydrophilic) and a nonpolar (hydrophobic) group. Due to their amphiphilic nature they are widely used in household cleaning agents (detergents), personal care products, textiles, paints, inks, polymers, pesticide formulations, pharmaceuticals, mining, oil recovery as well as pulp and paper industries. Surfactants enter the environment mainly through the discharge of sewage effluents into natural water and the application sewage sludge on land for soil fertilizing purposes. Most of the commercial surfactants used today by different industries are only partially and slowly biodegradable; they tend to sorb and accumulate on sludge and soil  sediments. causing a potential ecotoxicological and pollution risk in the environment. Moreover, the metabolites of some alkyl phenol ethoxylates have recently been declared as hormone mimicking/endocrine disrupting compounds. Therefore, the efficient management and treatment of surfactants remains a serious challenge. In this respect, more effective {{and at the same time}} economically feasible abatement processes have to be developed to alleviate the problem of surfactants/surfactant metabolites in the environment. Alkylphenol polyethoxylates are industrial compounds belonging to the class of nonionic surfactants that are designed to have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. Among them, octylphenol polyethoxylates have been widely used in cleaning products, paints, ink dispersants, textile preparation and leather processing, manufacture of pulp and paper, metalworking, cosmetics and personal care products. However, many of these applications are now restricted by the European Commission due to the raising concerns regarding the environmental safety of alkylphenol (poly) ethoxylates and its metabolites. It has been reported that their <b>aerobic</b> / anaerobic <b>transformation</b> products (alkylphenols such as nonylphenol and octylphenol) are much more inhibitory and estrogenic than the original surfactants. Despite the above-mentioned concerns regarding the use of alkylphenol (poly) ethoxylates, these products still appear in several industrial applications where they cannot not be replaced by alternative chemicals due to technical and economic reasons. Consequently, the presence of these nonionic surfactants and their degradation products have been reported in water bodies, sediments and sludge associated with the continuing discharges from industrial and sewage treatment plants.   The scientific literature on the biodergadability and fate of alkylphenol polyethoxylates in the aquatic as well as terrestrial environment reinforces the idea that more efficient, alternative treatment processes are needed for their effective elimination. Besides conventional biochemical, chemical and physical treatment methods, chemical oxidation (ozonation, advanced oxidation) has been extensively studied as an alternative for the treatment of nonionic surfactants and their metabolites. Among the existing hydroxyl radicals (HO•) -induced advanced oxidation processes, TiO 2 /UV, H 2 O 2 /UV, O 3 /UV, H 2 O 2 /UV, Fenton and Photo-Fenton processes have attracted considerable interest since these exhibit relatively high treatment efficiencies and kinetics. More recently, sulfate radicals (SO 4 •-) -driven advanced oxidation processes have been investigated to treat pollutants found in water and wastewater. The reduction potential of SO 4 •- is lower than that of HO• (2. 6 versus 2. 9 eV); however, SO 4 •- are also capable of non-selectively and rapidly reacting with pollutants in a series of free radical chain reactions being similar to those established for HO•-based advanced oxidation processes. SO 4 •- can be produced from persulfate ions via chemical, radiolytic, thermal or photochemical activation; or alternatively by redox reactions with transition metals as in the case of the Fenton’s reagent. An alternative to iron-based (Fenton-like) advanced oxidation processes are zero valent iron (ZVI; Fe 0) catalyzed treatment systems. They have received global interest and promising results have been reported so far for the removal of chlorinated organics, nitroaromatic compounds, arsenic, heavy metals, nitrate, industrial dyes and phenols by micro-and nanoscale ZVI. ZVI is reactive (redox potential = - 0. 44 eV), non-toxic, abundant, cheap, relatively easy to produce and its treatment applications require little maintenance. ZVI is capable of oxidizing organic as well as inorganic pollutants by an electron transfer mechanism. However, for harsher conditions, ZVI treatment has to be enhanced chemical or thermally by the involvement of oxidants (for example, hydrogen peroxide or persulfate). Besides, the extensive follow-up of toxicity is critical to ensure economically and ecologically safe applications of advanced oxidation processes. The ecotoxicological characterization of sulfate radical-based treatment systems during their application to treat industrial pollutants is an untouched area in this research field. For this purpose, bioassays employing the marine photobacterium Vibrio fischeri remain the most popular test protocols since these enable easy and rapid measurement of cytotoxicity in water and wastewater samples being subjected to advanced oxidation. Although V. fischeri is very sensitive and hence useful for obtaining a preliminary idea about the inhibitory effect of pollutants and their degradation products, it is more appropriate to support toxicity results with other types of test organisms preferably from different trophic levels. For example, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata are important freshwater microalage being routinely used as primary producers ito assess the acute and chronic toxicity of surfactants.   Considering the above facts, the motivation of the present work was to study the treatability and acute toxicity of the commercially important nonionic surfactant octylphenol polyethoxylate (known as “Triton X- 45 ”) in aqueous solution with the ZVI/S 2 O 82 - advanced oxidation system. To our knowledge, this was the first study investigating the treatability of a nonionic surfactant with persulfate activated ZVI nanoparticles. Within the scope of this experimental study, firstly, preliminary optimization tests were performed under varying reaction conditions (ZVI and persulfate concentrations, pH’s and treatment time) together with control runs (ZVI only and persulfte only expeirments). Thereafter, time dependent changes in the surfactant, TOC, persulfate concentrations and pH were followed for the optimized treatment system. Then, the acute toxicity of the nonionic surfactant and its degradation products was also followed by employing two different bioassays with V. fischeri and P. subcapitata. It can be said that, OPEO has corrosive and toxic effects on people and other organisms. Results indicated that the nonionic surfactant solution (20 mg/L original concentration) could be degraded in less than 1 hour (40 - 60) by 95 % accompanied with up to 40 % TOC removal by 1 g/L ZVI nanoparticles activated with 2. 5 mM (480 mg/L) persulfate at an initial reaction pH of 5. 0. The acute toxicities (percent relative inhibition rates) decreased significantly from originally 66 % to 21 % and originally 16 % to non-toxic for V. fischeri and P. subcapitata, respectively. The photobacterium V. fischeri appeared to be more sensitive to octylphenol polyethoxylate and its degradation products than the microalgae P. subcapitata. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
