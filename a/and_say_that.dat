25|$|At Hines Corners, {{there is}} a plaque commemorating the {{founding}} of the original Village of Hine's Corners by David and Merritt Hine. The plaque was placed there on August 9, 1925, by descendants of the Hine family. Interestingly, it states that the Hines founded the community in 1811, while historical sources (all of which were published before the erection of the plaque) put the founding date at either 1831 or 1840 instead. However, these sources also offer a possible solution: both note that the younger Hine came from Connecticut (or Massachusetts) in 1811 (or 1810), <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he came first to the nearby Village of Ararat in Ararat Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania. It is possible that family lore may have diverged from the truth in the intervening century between Hine's Corners' founding and the plaque's erection.|$|E
25|$|On December 1, 1598, Juan de Zaldívar, Oñate's nephew, reached Acoma with 20–30 men and peacefully traded {{with them}} and had to wait some days for their order of ground corn. On December 4th, Zaldívar went with 16 armored men to Acoma {{to find out about}} the corn. Zutacapan met them and {{directed}} them to the homes with the corn. Zaldívar's people then divided into groups to collect the corn. The traditional oral Acoma narrative tells that a group attacked some Acoma women leading Acoma warriors to retaliate. The Spanish documents do not report an attack on the women <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the division of the men was a reaction to Zutacapan's plan to kill Zaldívar's party. The Acoma killed 12 of the Spaniards including Zaldívar. Five men escaped although one died from jumping over the citadel leaving four to escape with the remaining camp.|$|E

25|$|Gray Davis critics often {{charge that}} he did not respond {{properly}} to the crisis, while his defenders attribute the crisis solely to the corporate accounting scandals <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Davis did all he could. Some critics on the left, such as Arianna Huffington, alleged that Davis was lulled to inaction by campaign contributions from energy producers. Some of Davis' energy advisers were formerly employed by the same energy speculators who made millions from the crisis. In addition, the Democratic-controlled legislature would sometimes push Davis to act decisively by taking over power plants which were known to have been gamed and place them back under control of the utilities. Some conservatives argued that Davis signed overpriced energy contracts, employed incompetent negotiators and refused to allow prices to rise for residences statewide much like they did in San Diego, which they argue could have given Davis more leverage against the energy traders and encouraged more conservation. The electricity crisis {{is considered one of the}} major factors that led to Davis' recall.|$|E
