50|$|<b>Ambucetamide</b> is an {{antispasmodic}} {{found to}} be particularly effective for the relief of menstrual pain. It was discovered in 1953 by Paul Janssen.|$|E
50|$|During his {{military}} service, {{he worked at}} the University of Cologne in Germany at the Institute of Pharmacology of J. Schuller, where he worked until 1952. After he returned to Belgium he worked part-time at the Institute of Pharmacology and Therapeutics (University of Ghent) of Professor Corneille Heymans, who had won the Nobel prize for medicine in 1938. Janssen founded his own research laboratory in 1953, with a loan of 50,000 Belgian francs from his father. In 1953 he also discovered his first drug <b>ambucetamide,</b> an antispasmodic found to be particularly effective for the relief of menstrual pain.|$|E
50|$|Paul Janssen founded his own {{research}} laboratory in 1953 {{on the third}} floor of the building in the Statiestraat, still within the Richter-Eurpharma company of his father. In 1955, he and his team developed their first drug: Neomeritine (<b>ambucetamide),</b> an antispasmodic found to be particularly effective for the relief of menstrual pain. On 5 April 1956, the name of the company was changed to NV Laboratoria Pharmaceutica C. Janssen (named after Constant Janssen). On 27 April 1957, the company opened a new research facility in Beerse, but the move to Beerse would not be completed until 1971-1972. On 2 May 1958, the research department in Beerse became a separate legal entity, the N.V. Research Laboratorium C. Janssen.|$|E
40|$|A plain-muscle stimulant, {{provisionally}} {{named the}} “menstrual stimulant,” {{may be involved}} in the causation of dysmenorrhoea. Since <b>ambucetamide</b> [α-dibutylamino-α-(p-methoxyphenyl) -acetamide] has been claimed to alleviate this condition, its effects on the responses of human myometrial preparations to the menstrual stimulant have been studied. <b>Ambucetamide</b> ragularly inhibited these responses,as well as those to vasopressin,and sometimes diminished the spontaneous rhythmical activity of the human myometrium. The rat and guinea-pig uterus, the guinea-pig and cat intestine preprarations, showed more complex responses and may therefore be less suitable for testing antispasmodic drugs intended for treatment of dysmenorrhoea...|$|E
