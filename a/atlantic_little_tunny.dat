40|$|AbstractThe <b>Atlantic</b> <b>little</b> <b>tunny,</b> Euthynnus alletteratus, {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in temperate and tropical {{waters of the}} Atlantic Ocean, Black and Mediterranean Seas. In this study, wild-caught little tunny from Egypt, {{were found to be}} naturally infected with trypanorhyncha metacestodes, and the overall prevalence rate of infection was 38. 7 %. The blastocysts were either loosely attached to the mesentery of infected fish, or firmly attached and deeply embedded within the hepatic parenchyma. These encysted plerocerci are identified as Callitetrarhynchus gracilis (Trypanorhyncha, Lacistorhynchidae) based on its morphological and molecular characterization. The morphological characteristics of C. gracilis including scolex shape; the bothridia groove; the presence of frontal glands; the length of post-larval (appendix); metabasal armature; the existence of ‘Chainette’ and satellite hooks of different size were studied and described by Light and Scanning electron microscope. The phylogenetic analysis of lsrDNA gene of plerocerci confirmed the identification of the species to be deeply embedded in genus Callitetrarhynchus. The histopathological examination revealed severe pathological changes in the affected organs, including necrosis, inflammatory reactions, fibrosis and migratory tracts of the parasitic larvae together with marked visceral organs adhesions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the detection of C. gracilis in little tunny collected from the Abu Qir landing site in Alexandria, Egypt...|$|E
50|$|The <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> {{is found}} in the neritic waters of the {{temperate}} and tropical zones in the Atlantic ocean. It can also be found in the waters of the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. In the eastern <b>Atlantic,</b> the <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> has been found from Skagerrak to South Africa. Although found it this broad range of latitudes, it is rare north of the Iberian Peninsula or farther south than Brazil. On the Atlantic coast of the United States, they can be caught as far north as Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and as far south as the tip of Florida, as well as throughout the waters of the Gulf of Mexico.|$|R
50|$|Bony fish, Marlins, sea birds, sharks, and rays prey on the <b>little</b> <b>tunny.</b> Other tunas, {{including}} conspecifics and {{yellowfin tuna}} (Thynnus albacares) are predators of the <b>little</b> <b>tunny.</b> Fish {{such as the}} dolphin fish (Coryphaena hippurus), wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri), Atlantic sailfish (Istiophorus albicans), swordfish (Xiphias gladius), and various sharks {{as well as other}} large marine carnivores all prey on the <b>little</b> <b>tunny.</b> Among those sharks is the whale shark, who feeds on the <b>little</b> <b>tunny's</b> recently spawned eggs. Seabirds prey on small <b>little</b> <b>tunny.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>little</b> <b>tunny's</b> habitat {{tends to}} be {{near-shore}} waters, much closer to shore than most other tunas. They live in and around inlets, points, jetties, and sandbars. All of these places are where bait fish like sardine and menhaden, both favorites of the <b>little</b> <b>tunny,</b> form large schools, which are very helpful to the <b>little</b> <b>tunny's</b> feeding style. While the <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> is abundant in offshore ocean waters, it is unusual to find it in brackish water of estuaries. The very young will enter estuaries in South Africa. The <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> prefers relatively warm water, from 24° to 30° Celsius. The <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> migrates south {{in the winter and}} fall, and northward in the spring, through coastal waters. It is not as migratory as other tuna species.|$|R
50|$|As {{with many}} inshore gamefish like {{bluefish}} and striped bass, schools of <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> are usually indicated by flocks of birds diving in coastal waters. Fishermen targeting them often troll bait, cast lures, and float fish. When trolling for <b>Little</b> <b>Tunny,</b> fishermen often use small lures baited with either mullet or ballyhoo or lures dressed with colored feathers. When float fishing, popular baits are Spot, Bluefish, or Pinfish. Popular lures include deadly dicks, maria jigs, and other slender-profiled, brightly colored metal lures {{that can be}} cast far and retrieved quickly that imitate the small baitfish the <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> are often feeding on. Some anglers use <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> for strip bait to catch other species, but most fish are released as the <b>Little</b> <b>Tunny</b> is not commonly {{thought of as a}} food fish. There is little regulation of the fishery, no size or bag limits, and no closed season. The flesh of the <b>Little</b> <b>Tunny</b> is coarse in texture, strong in flavor, and dark in color if compared to bluefin or yellowfin tuna.|$|R
50|$|Constantine Samuel Rafinesque {{identified}} the <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> in 1810 {{and gave the}} fish its current name: Euthynnus alletteratus. Synonyms for used for the name include E. alleteratus alleteratus, E. alliteratus, E. thunina, and E. alletteratus aurolitoralis. The <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> {{is not part of}} the Thunnus genus like many tuna, but it is part of the Thunnini tribe.|$|R
50|$|The <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> {{has some}} {{anatomical}} variations {{when compared to}} other species of Euthynnus. E. alletteratus lacks a swim bladder, like most other tuna, so it must constantly keep moving to stay afloat. The pectoral fins are crucial to the <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> in maintaining its position in the water column. Its liver is very disproportionate, with the right lobe much longer than the left or middle lobes. The stomach of the <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> is a long sac that stretches almost the entire length of its body. The intestinal tract is fairly short, coming from the left and right sides of the stomach, and extending without looping down the length of its body. The different sections are characterized by their diameter and color. The ventral vertebral column of the <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> has unique trelliswork, which is important to its family (Scombridae). Divided haemapophyses, or parts of the vertebrate forming a long canal, enclose the large ventral blood vessel.|$|R
40|$|Age {{estimates}} {{were made on}} otolith of 61 bonito, Sarda sarda, and 39 <b>little</b> <b>tunny,</b> Euthynnus alletteratus, captured by clupeoids purse seine in the Southern Italian seas. Increment counts, presumed to be daily, were made for age estimation. Estimated ages of bonito {{ranging in size from}} 10. 5 to 39. 8 cm fork lenght (FL), ranged from 18 and 110 days, {{as well as those of}} <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> ranging in size from 7, 5 to 25, 2 cm fork lenght (FL), ranged from 18 to 69 days. Linear regressions indicated growth rates of 3. 26 mm and 3. 96 mm per day, within the size interval analysed, respectively for bonito and <b>little</b> <b>tunny.</b> RÉSUM...|$|R
50|$|The <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> is {{typically}} a schooling species. It lives in schools {{based primarily on}} fish size rather than species, so {{other members of the}} Scombridae family, like the Atlantic bonito, may be present. These schools cover areas up to 3.2 kilometres long. <b>Little</b> <b>tunny</b> that have not yet reached adulthood form tight schools offshore. Larger schools are more common offshore whereas smaller groups may wander far inshore.|$|R
40|$|Trophic {{ecology and}} diet of the <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> (Euthynnus alletteratus) in central Colombian Caribbean is described. The <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> is a pelagic top {{predator}} {{but not a}} voracious fish (trophic level of 4. 49, Q/B of 10. 8). Its diet seems impoverished when compared with a study conducted in 1986 in the same general location and with studies in other locations. Moreover, the main diet item has changed, new items have appeared and other have disappeared in the time interval between 1986 and the present study (2003 / 2004, 18 years). Lack of monitoring of pelagic fish populations precludes the identification of tendencies but a regime change hypothesis is worth investigating. The <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> eats more in the dry season than in the rainy season and diet items change with seasons in line with findings of other studies that signal correlations between seasons and diet. Likewise, local <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> eats more in the afternoon than in the morning which suggests it eats in daylight not in the night contrary {{to what has been}} found in studies somewhere else...|$|R
50|$|In {{preparing}} <b>Little</b> <b>Tunny</b> for consumption, {{it should}} be bled and iced {{as soon as possible}} after being caught. There are many ways to eat the <b>Little</b> <b>Tunny,</b> such as Tuna Salad. To do this, the fillets are first baked, then chilled and flaked, then mixed in with the salad. Removing the dark strips of meats that extend the length of each fillet helps to reduce the naturally fishy flavor. Another way to prepare the <b>Little</b> <b>Tunny</b> is first to bleed it, barbecue it in foil, remove the meat from the bone, and then let it chill overnight. Various seasonings can be used to enhance the flavor. Fresh steaks can be quite good if seasoned with salt, pepper and lemon, and thinly sliced tunny makes good sashimi. It is commonly eaten as such in Japan.|$|R
40|$|In the {{fisheries}} of Vizhingam seven {{different types of}} tuna are distinguished. They are Auxis thazard (Lacepede), Auxis thynnoides Bleeker, Sarda orientalis (Temminck and Schlegel), Kishinoella tonggol (Bleeker), Neothunnus macropterus (Temminck and Schlegel), Katsuwonus pelamis (Linnaeus) and Euthynnus afinis afJinis (Cantor). A comprehensive account on their identification is given by Jones and Silas (1960). The <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> or mackerel tuna (Euthynnus afinis affinis) is commercially {{one of the most}} important species at Vizhingam. The fisheries of the <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> have assumed importance in recent years owing to the great demand for dried tuna in India and abroad. Research on the biology and fishery of the <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> has been but meagre and practically no information is available on these subjects. In this paper some aspects of its biology are dealt with based on material from Vizhingam...|$|R
5000|$|The {{coloration}} of the <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> {{is typically}} metallic blue or blue-green with dark, wavy stripes above the lateral line. These [...] "worm-like" [...] lines are within a well-marked border that never extends farther forward than {{the middle of}} the first dorsal fin. The belly is bright white with three to seven dark, fingerprint-like spots around the pectoral and pelvic fins. The <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> is commonly confused with the Atlantic bonito because of coloration, but the two fish differ in their color patterns and overall body size.|$|R
40|$|Surveillance for mercury (Hg), lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) {{contamination}} in tuna products {{is crucial for}} consumer food safety. Hg, Pb and Cd contaminants were monitored {{in a total of}} 60 specimens of fresh <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> (Euthynnus alletteratus) and popular brands of skipjack and yellowfin (Katsuwonus pelamis and Thunnus albacares) canned tuna commercially available in Tripoli, Libya. Direct Mercury Analyzer (DMA- 80) was implemented for determination of total Hg level and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS) was employed for determination of Cd and Pb concentrations. The results indicated that Hg had the highest concentration level and Cd had the lowest concentration level either in tested canned tuna or fresh <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> samples. The average concentration of Hg in fresh <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> samples was 1. 185 ± 0. 968 mg kg- 1 wet weight (ww) and often exceeded the standard permissible limit. In addition, canned yellowfin tuna had the lowest levels of Cd (0. 027 ± 0. 026 mg kg- 1 ww), Pb (0. 075 ± 0. 071) and Hg (0. 163 ± 0. 122 mg kg- 1 ww). Results of the current surveillance indicated that canned skipjack and yellowfin tuna sold in Tripoli markets show contaminant levels well under the European thresholds adopted for Cd, Pb and Hg. However, consumption of large quantities of Mediterranean <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> products significantly increases human exposure to the risk of Hg toxicity...|$|R
50|$|In {{coastal waters}} along the North American eastern seaboard, <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> are carnivorous, and {{primarily}} feed on small fish and invertebrates {{that occur in}} schools. Its diet consists mostly of fish; it particularly likes the Atlantic bigeye and largehead hairtail. Second to fish, the <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> consumes crustaceans, and lastly cephalopods and gastropods make up {{a small part of}} its diet. Sardines, scad, and anchovies are common in the diet along with squid, stomatopods, and organisms from the Diogenidae family. The diet of the fish is also relative to its size. A smaller fish's diet typically consists of clupeiforms, and larvae, while the larger fish mostly eat Maurolicus muelleri. The typical diet is very {{similar to that of the}} king mackerel because the fish are of a similar size and live in the same area of the water column. It mostly feeds on pelagic fish. The <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> is an opportunistic predator, feeding on crustaceans, clupeid fishes, squids, and tunicates. Its diet also responds to seasonal changes in food availability. It has nocturnal feeding habits, and is a specialist feeder. It often feeds on herring and sardines in inshore waters near the surface of the water. The <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> commonly feeds in large schools because their primary food sources (small fish and the larval forms of crustaceans) are typically in schools, as well.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} manage a fish stock relies on an {{understanding}} of life history characteristics and basic biology of the species. Numerous age-growth studies are facilitated by the relative ease of ageing fishes through hard-part analyses. Determining reproductive parameters for fish populations is equally important for stock assessments and management, and histological examination of gonads provides the most accurate determination of fecundity and spawning periods. Coastal pelagic fishes are often targeted commercially and recreationally due to their easy access by private vessels. However, there are few studies researching the biology and reproduction of recreational fishes {{in the waters of}} Southeastern Florida that would lead to a better understanding for management practices. The objective {{of this study was to}} provide baseline reproductive data for two fishes particularly important to Florida fisheries: the coastal pelagic scombrids Blackfin Tuna Thunnus atlanticus and <b>Little</b> <b>Tunny</b> Euthynnus alletteratus. Archived gonad samples from 2010 - 2014 for these two species were evaluated, and GSI values and histological examination indicated one spawning season for both species. <b>Little</b> <b>Tunny</b> spawn April through August, and Blackfin Tuna spawn May through June. Additionally both species have asynchronous oocyte development, and are batch spawners. Postovulatory follicles were used to estimate spawning frequency; for Blackfin Tuna, mean spawning occurs once every 1. 49 days, and for <b>Little</b> <b>Tunny,</b> mean spawning occurs once every 1. 47 days. Comparison of otolith age data to these results indicates that <b>Little</b> <b>Tunny</b> mature at a smaller size and younger age than Blackfin Tuna. Size at 50 % maturity for male Blackfin Tuna was 435. 2 mm TL, for female Blackfin Tuna was 392. 3 mm TL, and for male <b>Little</b> <b>Tunny</b> was 347. 77 mm TL. Age at 50 % majority for male Blackfin Tuna was 0. 66 years, and for male <b>Little</b> <b>Tunny</b> was 0. 50 years. In addition to providing important baseline data for fisheries management, this study collaborated with previous research to improve accuracy of reproductive age assessments. Finally, reproductive parameter studies of fishes in Florida and the Greater Caribbean area commercial and recreational fisheries provide information important for future ecosystem based management...|$|R
40|$|The {{length and}} weight {{frequency}} distributions, length-weight, age-length and age-weight relationships, growth parameters, condition factors and mortality rates of 1599 individuals of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>little</b> tunny- Euthynnus alleteratus (Rafinesque, 1810) {{caught in the}} Aegean and the Mediterranean Seas from April 1994 to May 1998 were studied. The fishing restrictions, depending on the scientific criteria, were determined by the age and growth parameters. For the determination of age, the first spine rays of the first dorsal fins were used. The sexual maturity periods of representative samples of the gonads obtained from females were examined. The ages of the <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> were determined as age groups of I- VI for the Aegean Sea and I- IX for the Mediterranean Sea. For the Aegean Sea, the average of fork length age groups were 53. 87 cm, 61. 27 cm, 67. 93 cm, 73. 92 cm, 79. 31 cm, 84. 16 cm, and these values for the Mediterranean Sea, were 56. 57 cm, 64. 53 cm, 71. 52 cm, 77. 69 cm, 83. 12 cm, 87. 90 cm, 92. 12 cm, 95. 83 cm, and 99. 09 cm respectively. The length-weight relationship was determined in accordance with Le Cren’s (1951) allometric growth equation; W= 0. 0000476 L 2. 72562 for the Mediterranean Sea, and W= 0. 0000575 L 2. 69693 for the Aegean Sea. As a result of regression analyses, the growth in Euthynnus alleteratus {{was determined to be}} allometric. L¥ value was calculated to be 127. 500 cm for individuals caught in the Aegean Sea, whereas for the Mediterranean Sea the L ¥ was 123. 229 cm. It can be concluded that the minimum catch size of the <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> of 30 cm is not realistic. The minimum size to catch <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> in Turkish waters should be 60 cm.

25|$|The highly {{migratory species}} include: tuna and tuna-like species (albacore, Atlantic bluefin, bigeye tuna, skipjack, yellowfin, blackfin, <b>little</b> <b>tunny,</b> Pacific bluefin, {{southern}} bluefin and bullet), pomfret, marlin, sailfish, swordfish, saury and oceangoing sharks, dolphins and other cetaceans.|$|R
50|$|The <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> {{reaches a}} maximum weight of 12 kg in the Mediterranean, and averages about 7 kg through its entire range. Its maximum fork length (distance {{from the tip of}} the snout to the fork of the tail) in the Mediterranean is about 100 cm and in the Atlantic is about a 90 cm. Average fork length for an adult fish {{throughout}} the entire range is about 85 cm. Some fish may reach a length of 100 cm or more, but most commonly they are around 64 cm. The largest <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> on record is 120 cm and 17 kg. Females reach sexual maturity at 27 to(-) 37 cm in fork length, while males mature at about 40 cm.|$|R
50|$|The snout is {{shorter than}} the rest of the head. The <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> has a dorsal fin with 10 to 15 tall, {{descending}} spines, as well as a much smaller second dorsal fin followed by eight finlets. At the base, the two dorsal fins are separated by a small interspace. The anal fin has 11 to 15 slightly defined rays, and is followed by seven finlets. The pectoral fins are short and do not reach the end of the first dorsal fin and are joined to the pelvic fins by interpelvic processes. There are 37-45 gill rakers, bony projections off the gills, on the first arch. There are no scales on the body of the <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> except along the lateral line and on the corselet: a thick band of scales circling the body.|$|R
50|$|The <b>little</b> <b>tunny's</b> {{markings}} {{allow it}} to easily be distinguished from similar species. It is often confused with the skipjack tuna, the frigate tuna, the Atlantic bonito, and the bullet tuna. Close relatives also include the kawakawa and the black skipjack. The scattering of dark, fingerprint-like spots between the pectoral and pelvic fins cannot be found on any related Atlantic species. The first dorsal fin of the Atlantic bonito is also lower and sloping. Its lack of teeth on the vomer can set it apart from its close Pacific relatives, the kawakawa and the black skipjack. The dorsal fins of the bullet and frigate mackerel are set apart. Unlike the <b>little</b> <b>tunny,</b> the skipjack tuna lacks markings {{on the back and}} has broad, straight stripes on the underside.|$|R
50|$|Garudiya or Garudhiya (ގަރުދިޔަ) {{is a clear}} fish broth. It is one of {{the basic}} and {{traditional}} food items of Maldivian cuisine. The broth is based on tuna species found in the nation's ocean waters such as skipjack (kanḍumas or goḍa), yellowfin tuna (kanneli), <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> (lațți), or frigate tuna) (raagonḍi).|$|R
50|$|The {{favourite}} fish is skipjack tuna, either dried or fresh.

These can be eaten boiled or processed.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Little</b> <b>tunny</b> spawn {{in water}} that is at least [...] in the months of April through November in the Atlantic Ocean. The {{spawning}} season of the <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> in the Mediterranean is generally between May and September, but the most intensive spawning occurs between July and August. The major spawning areas are offshore, in waters that are 30 to 40 metres deep. The females are prolific fish, and can release 1.75 million eggs, in multiple clutches over a mating season. The eggs are fertilized {{in the water column}} after the males release sperm. The eggs are buoyant, spherical, transparent, and pelagic. A droplet of oil within the egg adds to its buoyancy. The diameter of the eggs can be anywhere from 0.8 mm to 1.1 mm, and they are light amber. Larvae are released 24 hours after fertilization and are approximately 3 mm in size. Pigmentation in the eyes appear 48 hours after hatching. The teeth and fins develop at sizes of 3.7-14 mm. Once the larvae are 14 mm to 174 mm long, they take on the adult appearance; the body becomes more elongated. Studies have found that it takes approximately 3 years for the <b>little</b> <b>tunny's</b> gonads to reach sexual maturity. The average size of a sexually mature individual is 38 cm in fork length.|$|R
50|$|The {{abundant}} sea {{harvest of}} the Indian Ocean around the Atolls of the Maldives yields many pelagic fishes, like skipjack, yellowfin tuna, <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> (known locally as laṭṭi) and frigate mackerel.

50|$|Parasites of the <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> {{include the}} copepods Caligus bonito, Caligus coryphaenae, and Caligus productus, all {{found on the}} body surface {{as well as on}} the wall of the branchial cavities. Another copepod, Pseudocycnoides appendiculatus, has been {{documented}} as parasitic on the gill filaments. Other parasites include digenea (flukes), monogenea (gillworms), cestoda (tapeworms), and isopods.|$|R
5000|$|Commonly called false {{albacore}} or little tuna, it resembles the Atlantic bonito, skipjack tuna, and species of mackerel. The <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> feeds primarily on pelagic fish. It is best {{identified by the}} dark spots appearing between its pectoral and ventral fins and [...] "worm-like" [...] markings on its back. Commercially, the fish is used as bait for sharks and marlin due to its high oil content and hook retention. It {{is considered by many}} to be a trash fish because of its limited nutritional value; ciguatera poisoning related to its consumption has even been reported. However, the <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> is commercially important in many locations, including the West Indies. It is marketed fresh, dried, canned, smoked, and frozen. It is sought-after as a sport fish due to its line-stripping 64 km/h runs and hard fighting ability when hooked. By trolling with lures near reefs, it can be caught on hook and line.|$|R
50|$|The {{technique}} is to trap {{and catch the}} tuna when they are crossing between the Atlantic ocean to the Mediterranean during February to July, {{on their way to}} spawn anduntil recently, on its return journey, (“al revés”) when they come back into the Atlantic Ocean, they also Bycatch: bullet tuna (Auxis rochei), <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> (Euthynnusalletteratus), <b>Atlantic</b> bonito (Sarda sarda), bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) and swordfish(Xiphias gladius).|$|R

40|$|Billfishes are {{considered}} to be among the fastest swimmers in the oceans. Previous studies have estimated maximum speed of sailfish and black marlin at around 35  m s− 1 but theoretical work on cavitation predicts that such extreme speed is unlikely. Here we investigated maximum speed of sailfish, and three other large marine pelagic predatory fish species, by measuring the twitch contraction time of anaerobic swimming muscle. The highest estimated maximum swimming speeds were found in sailfish (8. 3 ± 1. 4  m s− 1), followed by barracuda (6. 2 ± 1. 0  m s− 1), <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> (5. 6 ± 0. 2  m s− 1) and dorado (4. 0 ± 0. 9  m s− 1); although size-corrected performance was highest in <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> and lowest in sailfish. Contrary to previously reported estimates, our results suggest that sailfish are incapable of exceeding swimming speeds of 10 - 15  m s− 1, which corresponds to the speed at which cavitation is predicted to occur, with destructive consequences for fin tissues...|$|R
40|$|The trophic {{interactions}} and feeding ecology of coastal pelagic fishes remains poorly known. To elucidate these ecological relationships, this {{study focused on}} six species: king mackerel, blackfin tuna, skipjack tuna, <b>little</b> <b>tunny,</b> wahoo, and dolphinfish. From March 2010 to March 2012, samples from over 500 fishes were collected opportunistically from recreational anglers in southeast Florida. The stomach, gonads, muscle tissue, and liver tissue were collected from each specimen, as well as length data. Stable isotope analysis of carbon δ 13 C and δ 15 N in the muscle tissue was conducted along with descriptions of stomach contents. The combined analyses provide a more complete evaluation of the trophic {{interactions and}} positions among the coastal pelagic community. The preliminary analysis of stomach contents and  13 C data for blackfin tuna, king mackerel, and <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> (- 16. 5 to 20. 5) shows a diverse diet of fish, squid, and crustaceans.

40|$|Pelagic {{marine species}} {{with a large}} migratory {{potential}} are expected to exhibit little genetic structure. However, this statement of putative homogenous population has been recently challenged by series of genetic studies in several small tuna species revealing unexpected population structure in relative small areas. One of these examples is the Atlantic bonito (Sarda sarda) in the Mediterranean Sea. Based on distribution of spawning grounds and migratory movements, the Atlantic bonito {{was thought to be}} structured in two isolated populations within this sea. However, recent genetic studies revealed that Atlantic bonito presented a population structure corresponding to isolation by distance mechanism. Furthermore, the North Atlantic population is genetically isolated from the Mediterranean. Other striking example has been recently observed in <b>Little</b> <b>tunny</b> (Euthynnus alletteratus). Initially, <b>Little</b> <b>tunny</b> was described as a single species distributed on both sides of Atlantic Ocean including the Mediterranean Sea. However, recent genetic analysis was able to identify cryptic species between east and west North Atlantic populations.

40|$|Knowing {{the feeding}} ecology of marine predators is pivotal to {{developing}} {{an understanding of}} their ecological role in the ecosystem and determining the trophic relationships between them. Despite the ecological importance of predatory pelagic fish species, research on these species in the Mediterranean Sea is limited. Here, by combining analyses of stomach contents and stable isotope values, we examined the feeding strategies of swordfish, Xiphias gladius, <b>little</b> <b>tunny,</b> Euthynnus alletteratus and Atlantic bonito, Sarda sarda, in the western Mediterranean Sea. We also compared the trophic niche and trophic level of these species with published information of other sympatric pelagic predators present in the ecosystem. Results indicated that, although the diet of the three species was composed mainly by fin-fish species, a clear segregation in their main feeding strategies was found. Swordfish showed a generalist diet including demersal species such as blue whiting, Micromesistius poutassou, and European hake, Merluccius merluccius, and pelagic fin-fish such as barracudina species (Arctozenus risso and Lestidiops jayakari) or small pelagic fish species. <b>Little</b> <b>tunny</b> and <b>Atlantic</b> bonito were segregated isotopically between them and showed a diet basically composed of anchovy, Engraulis encrasicolus, and round sardinella, Sardinella aurita, and sardines, Sardina pilchardus, respectively. This trophic segregation, in addition to potential segregation by depth, is likely a mechanism that allows their potential coexistence within the same pelagic habitat. When the trophic position of these three predatory pelagic fish species is compared with other pelagic predators such as bluefin tuna, Thunnus thynnus, and dolphinfish, Coryphaena hippurus, present in the western Mediterranean Sea, we found that they show similar intermediate trophic position in the ecosystem. In conclusion, the combined stomach and isotopic results highlight, especially for <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> and <b>Atlantic</b> bonito, the trophic importance of Clupeoid species in their diet. In addition, the importance of demersal resources for swordfish provides evidence for the pelagic-demersal coupling of the ecosystem {{and the need to}} manage marine resources in an integrated way...|$|R
40|$|In {{the fishery}} along Tuticorin Coast in the Gulf of Mannar, seven species of tuna and tuna-like fishes occur. They are the <b>little</b> <b>tunny</b> Euthynnus affinis (Cantor), Frigate {{mackerel}} Auxis thazard (Lacepede), bullet tuna Auxis rochei (Risso), oriental bonito, Sarda orientalis (Temminck and Schlegel), yellowfln tuna Thunnus albacares (Temminck and Schlegel), skipjack tuna Katsuwonus pelamis (Linnaeus) and long tail tuna Thunnus tonggol (Bleeker). In addition, among the billfishes, the sailflsh Istiophorus platypterus (Shaw and Nodder) and the striped marlin Tetrapterus audax (Philippi) also {{occur in the}} fishery...|$|R
