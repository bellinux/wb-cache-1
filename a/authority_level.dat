500|$|The {{programme}} {{has been}} supported by the main British political parties {{at the national level}} since its inception, and there has also been support from councillors from each of the main parties at the local <b>authority</b> <b>level.</b> On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the scheme in 2014, refugee groups and others praised it as a successful programme and called for it to be expanded, particularly in light of the Syrian refugee crisis. In early 2014, Amnesty International and the Refugee Council campaigned for the government to offer resettlement or humanitarian protection to Syrian refugees above and beyond the Gateway quota of 750 per year, [...] "to ensure that resettlement opportunities continue to be available to refugees {{from the rest of the}} world". The anniversary of the programme was also the occasion of further criticism of the 750 quota, with some commentators arguing that this is mean-spirited and continues to compare unfavourably with the refugee resettlement programmes of states including the United States, Canada and Australia. Others, such as academic Jonathan Darling, have been more skeptical about expanding the scheme, for fear that any such move will be accompanied by greater restrictions on the ability of people to claim asylum in the UK. He argues that [...] "we must be critical of any attempts to expand such a quota-based scheme at the expense of a more progressive asylum system". Furthermore, he argues that the [...] "hospitality" [...] of the scheme is highly conditional and can be viewed as a form of [...] "compassionate repression", with the UNHCR, the Home Office and local authorities all involved in [...] "sorting, decision, and consideration over which individuals are the 'exceptional cases'", to the exclusion of others.|$|E
