The violet-grey bolete, Tylopilus plumbeoviolaceus, {{is found in}} eastern North America and Korea. This species is somewhat similar in appearance, but can be distinguished by its smoother stipe, less brownish colors, and bitter taste. The Asian and North American black velvet bolete,T.alboater, has a black to grayish-brown cap and grows in deciduous woods. T.violatinctus, found in eastern North <b>America,</b> <b>has</b> whitish pores, a smooth stipe, and a somewhat paler cap than S.eximius.|$|E

Hygrocybe cantharellus is a bright red mushroom that has smaller fruit bodies and a more slender stipe than H.appalachianensis. It also has smaller spores, measuring 7–12 by 4–8µm. Hygrocybe reidii, found in Europe and northeastern North <b>America,</b> <b>has</b> flesh with a sweet odor that reminiscent of honey. This smell is sometimes weak and only noticeable when the tissue is rubbed, or when it is drying. Its scarlet cap initially has a narrow yellow-orange margin.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota {{is known}} for its {{progressive}} political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, a large number of European settlers entered the state who had mainly emigrated from Scandinavia and Germany. The state remains today a center of Scandinavian American and German American culture. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, the Horn of Africa, the Middle East and Latin <b>America</b> <b>has</b> broadened its historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota's standard of living index is {{among the highest in the}} United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation.|$|E
5|$|Morchella tridentina (=Morchella frustrata) is also rufescent {{and very}} similar to M. rufobrunnea. It is found in mountainous forests and maquis and forms a marked sinus at the {{attachment}} of the cap with the stem, which is pure white. At maturity, it develops more or less parallel, ladderlike interconnecting ridges. Microscopically, it often has moniliform paraphyses with septa extending in the upper half and has more regularly cylindrical or clavate 'hairs' on the stem, up to 100 μm long. M.guatemalensis, found in Central <b>America,</b> <b>has</b> a color ranging from yellow to yellowish-orange, but never grey, {{and it has a}} more distinct reddish to wine red bruising reaction. Microscopically, it has smaller paraphyses, measuring 56–103 by 6.5–13µm. The New Guinean species M.rigidoides has smaller fruit bodies that are pale ochre to yellow, without any grey. Its pits are less elongated than those of M.rufobrunnea, and it has wider paraphyses, up to 30µm.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} serious post-war studies of Meyerbeer and grand opera was Crosten's 1948 book Grand Opera: An Art and a Business which laid out the themes and {{standards}} for much subsequent research. A major contribution to revival of interest in Meyerbeer {{was the work of}} the scholar Heinz Becker, leading to the complete publication, between 1960 and 2006, of Meyerbeer's complete diaries and correspondence in German, which are an important source for musical history of the era. The English scholar Robert Letellier has translated the diaries and undertaken a wide range of Meyerbeer studies. Not least, the establishment of a 'Meyerbeer Fan Club' in <b>America</b> <b>has</b> stimulated interest.|$|E
