5|$|As Duckworth {{gathered}} his squadron, Northumberlands mainmast collapsed <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck,</b> causing severe {{damage to the}} ship's fittings. Although Cochrane's flagship was the most severely damaged of the squadron, all had suffered to a degree: Superbs men counted 60 shot holes while Atlas {{was out of control}} and Donegal had lost one of her topmasts. Casualties were also distributed throughout the fleet, with Northumberland and Spencer suffering the worst and Atlas the least except for the barely engaged Agamemnon. Total losses were 74 killed and 264 wounded and several ships were damaged, but Duckworth was rapidly able to effect repairs as his ships remained on station to observe the situation ashore.|$|E
5|$|Hood {{was due to}} be modernised in 1941 {{to bring}} her up to a {{standard}} {{similar to that of}} other modernised World War I-era capital ships. She would have received new, lighter turbines and boilers, a secondary armament of eight twin 5.25-inch gun turrets and six octuple 2-pounder pom-poms. Her 5-inch upper armour strake would have been removed and her deck armour reinforced. A catapult would have been fitted <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> and the remaining torpedo tubes removed. In addition the conning tower would have been removed and her bridge rebuilt. The ship's near-constant active service, resulting from her status as the Royal Navy's most battle-worthy fast capital ship, meant that her material condition gradually deteriorated, and by the mid-1930s she was in need of a lengthy overhaul.|$|E
5|$|The Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair was not {{convinced}} when {{the class was}} being designed that aircraft could effectively substitute as armament for a warship, especially at night or in bad weather that would prevent air operations. Thus the carriers' design included a substantial gun battery of eight 55-caliber Mk 9 eight-inch guns in four twin gun turrets. These turrets were mounted above the flight deck on the starboard side, two before the superstructure, and two behind the funnel, numbered I to IV from bow to stern. In theory the guns could fire to both sides, but {{it is probable that}} if they were fired to port (<b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck)</b> the blast would have damaged the flight deck. They could be depressed to −5° and elevated to +41°.|$|E

5|$|Armidale {{undertook}} evasive action, manoeuvring frantically {{to avoid}} the aerial attack. However, at 15:15, the vessel was struck by two air-launched torpedoes, one hitting her port side and the other colliding with the engineering spaces, before a bomb exploded aft. Armidale listed sharply to port at this stage, and the order was given to abandon ship. As the crew leapt into the sea, they were strafed by the attacking aircraft. Sheean—after assisting to free a life-raft—was hit by two bullets {{from one of the}} aircraft, wounding him in the chest and back. Scrambling <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck,</b> he strapped himself into the aft Oerlikon 20mm cannon and began shooting at the fighters in an effort to protect some of the sailors already in the sea. Subject to the fire from Sheean's Oerlikon, the Japanese aircraft were kept at bay and were unable to effectively strafe those in the water.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} damaged in the engagement, {{although}} Saumarez's damage was almost entirely confined to his rigging: very few shots had actually struck his hull during the battle, {{and the only}} one that provoked notice passed <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> without causing injury and struck a cannon on the opposite site, setting it off {{in the direction of a}} number of small gunboats that were approaching from the shore. Casualties on Crescent were equally light, with just one man injured; he had been standing too close to his own cannon during the opening broadside and had been struck by the recoiling gun, suffering a broken leg. Damage and losses on the French ship were very severe, with the rigging in tatters, the hull and lower masts repeatedly struck and casualties that Saumarez initially estimated at more than 120 men killed or wounded, although French accounts give the lower figure of 33 killed and 48 wounded.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes in}} which Cole {{appeared}} on the ship were done by using a harness {{as if she was}} flying. Because the actress wore green dress and makeup, the normal greenscreen was replaced by bluescreens in the studio. Cole felt it was fun to fly on the harness, but found it painful after a few hours. Gillan was allowed to perform several of her own stunts in the episode. She was excited to learn that her character would fight pirates with swords, and was taught how to handle one with basic moves. Gillan was also allowed to swing across the ship. However, a stunt double was required to film the sequence where Amy is thrown <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> by the Siren. The sickbay set was also built in a studio. Because the beds were attached to strings, they were prone to swaying. The cast members who were asked to lie on the beds were instructed to stay still and not breathe heavily to limit movement.|$|E

The {{original}} purpose was to store the bodies of important passengers or crew who had died on the voyage (lesser seamen would be buried at sea). It was a large locker, and was situated at the bow so that the smell of decomposition was blown away from the vessel rather than <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>decks.</b>|$|R

On 9 October, she rendezvoused with carrier groups cooperating in air strikes {{in support of the}} coming occupation of Leyte Island. At twilight on the 13th, the task group came under attack by four bombers, and Franklin twice was narrowly missed by torpedoes.

Kent had rescued {{the crew}} of another ship, the Queen, {{destroyed}} by fire, and therefore had an exceptionally large complement of 437 men, including her passengers; 300 of them were soldiers and sailors; Surcouf managed to board his larger opponent and, after over {{an hour and a}} half of battle <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> of <b>the</b> ship, seize control of the Kent.|$|R

25|$|The {{lifeboats}} {{were intended}} to be launched from davits supplied by the Welin Davit & Engineering Company of London. All lifeboats but the collapsibles were slung from the davits, ready to be launched. The davits were of a highly efficient double-acting quadrant design, capable of being slung inboard (hanging over the deck) as well as outboard (hanging over the side) to pick up additional lifeboats. The davits aboard Titanic were capable of accommodating 64 lifeboats, though only 16 were actually fitted to them. The collapsibles were also intended to be launched via the davits. Each davit was doubled up, supporting the forward arm of one boat and the after arm of the next one along. A bitt and sheave was located at the keel of each davit to facilitate the lowering of boats, and the falls could be taken <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> so {{that a number of}} men could work simultaneously on each boat and davit. They had to be lowered by hand, ideally by a team of between eight and ten men. Despite Titanic having a number of electric winches, they could only have been used to winch the lifeboats back out of the water.|$|E

25|$|The Spanish {{observed}} Anne Galleys unsupported {{approach and}} opened fire with the remaining guns aboard Real Felipe {{as well as those}} of the 70-gun Hercules. The fire ship was repeatedly struck in the hull, and quantities of gunpowder were blown from <b>the</b> compartments <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> and into <b>the</b> hold. To avoid casualties Commander Mackie ordered all but five of the crew to take to the boats, which were trailed on the far side of the ship to shelter them from enemy fire.

500|$|The Navy Advisory Board, {{confronted with}} the {{possibility}} of hostile ironclads operating off the American coast, began planning for a pair of ships to protect that coast in 1884.

500|$|Their main {{armament}} {{consisted of}} eight 12-inch (305mm) 50-caliber guns manufactured by Vickers. Each weighed [...] and fired an 850-pound (385kg) shell at a muzzle velocity of 3,000ft/s (914m/s). The guns had a maximum range of 23,500 yards (21,500 m) and {{a rate of}} fire of one round per minute. These guns were housed in four twin turrets, arranged with two on the centerline fore and aft, the others en echelon on the wings. The turrets were hydraulically operated, and could be loaded at any angle of elevation. The en echelon arrangement was chosen over superfiring turrets—such as those used in the American dreadnoughts—to save weight and cost. All four turrets could in theory fire on the broadside, and three could fire ahead or astern. However, blast effects from the wing turrets generally prohibited firing them <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> or directly ahead and astern.|$|E
500|$|On 31 January 1908, {{not long}} after Nimrods arrival at McMurdo Sound in the Antarctic, Mackintosh was {{assisting}} in the transfer of sledging gear aboard ship when a hook swung <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> and struck his right eye, virtually destroying it. He was immediately taken to the captain's cabin where, later that day, expedition doctor Eric Marshall operated to remove the eye, using partly improvised surgical equipment. Marshall was deeply impressed by Mackintosh's fortitude, observing that [...] "no man could have taken it better." [...] The accident cost Mackintosh his place on the shore party, and required his return to New Zealand for further treatment. He took no part in the main events of the expedition, but returned south with Nimrod in January 1909, {{to participate in the}} closing stages. Shackleton, who had earlier fallen out with the ship's master, Rupert England, had wanted Mackintosh to captain Nimrod on this voyage, but the eye injury had not healed sufficiently to make this appointment possible.|$|E
60|$|For fully half-an-hour {{that battle}} raged aboard the Frenchman. Beginning in the prow, it surged through the {{forecastle}} to the waist, where it reached a climax of fury. The French resisted stubbornly, {{and they had}} the advantage of numbers to encourage them. But for all their stubborn valour, they ended by being pressed back and back <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> that were dangerously canted to starboard by the pull of the water-logged Arabella. The buccaneers fought with the desperate fury of men who know that retreat is impossible, for there was no ship to which they could retreat, and here they must prevail and make the Victorieuse their own, or perish.|$|R

50|$|The {{breaking}} wave crashing onto <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> and superstructure of Stolt Surf caused considerable damage. Three {{of the tank}} hatches and {{the door to the}} pump room were torn off, despite their strong construction. <b>The</b> pipelines running <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> were bent and the gangways were tossed over <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> and wrecked.

Flooding entered the ship, smashing the furniture and tearing off bulkhead panelling. Despite the severe damage, there were no serious injuries, and only one sailor was subsequently hospitalised. Stolt Surf was fortunate in that her engines remained operational, and the ship was able to remain with her bow into the waves. Had she lost headway, the storm would have forced her to turn sideways into the oncoming waves, where she risked being hulled or capsized, particularly if she encountered another rogue wave. Stolt Surf limped into port a week later on 26 October.|$|R
