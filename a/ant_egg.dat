500|$|In {{areas of}} India, and {{throughout}} Burma and Thailand, a paste {{of the green}} weaver ant (Oecophylla smaragdina) is served as a condiment with curry. Weaver ant eggs and larvae, {{as well as the}} ants, may be used in a Thai salad, yam (...) , in a dish called yam khai mot daeng (...) or red <b>ant</b> <b>egg</b> salad, a dish that comes from the Issan or north-eastern region of Thailand. Saville-Kent, in the Naturalist in Australia wrote [...] "Beauty, {{in the case of the}} green ant, is more than skin-deep. Their attractive, almost sweetmeat-like translucency possibly invited the first essays at their consumption by the human species". Mashed up in water, after the manner of lemon squash, [...] "these ants form a pleasant acid drink which is held in high favor by the natives of North Queensland, and is even appreciated by many European palates".|$|E
50|$|Red ant {{eggs are}} cooked in types of food such as Spicy Raw <b>Ant</b> <b>Egg</b> Salad. ก้อยไข่มดเเดง {{seems to be}} the most popular dish. Because they contain acetic acid, red ant eggs are used instead of lemon juice or vinegar in many Thai dishes.|$|E
50|$|Most {{communities}} of Assam are also entomophagous. Ethnic tribes of certain areas also partake of Silkworm, Water Bugs, Grasshoppers, and other insects. Insects are fried or cooked or roasted in leaves and then prepared {{according to the}} timing of the meal. The red <b>ant</b> <b>egg</b> is considered a delicacy during the Rongali Bihu festival.|$|E
50|$|Pẻng rày (<b>ant's</b> <b>egg</b> cake): {{made from}} glutinous rice (tay language: khảu), <b>ant's</b> black <b>egg</b> (tay language: rày) and wrapped by leaves {{of a kind}} of fig (tay language: bâu ngỏa).|$|R
50|$|Their larvae feed on <b>ant</b> <b>eggs,</b> and {{probably}} also the larvae. They {{live in the}} arboreal nests of the ant species Polyrhachis queenslandica.|$|R
50|$|Red <b>ant</b> <b>eggs</b> {{can be used}} medicinally. Inhaling {{them while}} {{grinding}} them can relieve blackouts and dizziness. Boiling them with salt and drinking the result can immediately relieve constipation.|$|R

50|$|They eat a {{wide variety}} of animal and {{vegetable}} type-food, like fruit, seeds, grain, mast, berries and leaves as well as a wide range of invertebrates, such as leatherjackets, <b>ant</b> <b>eggs,</b> wireworms, caterpillars, grasshoppers and other insects; with small vertebrates like lizards, field voles, small mammals, and small birds occasionally taken.|$|R
25|$|In Thailand, certain {{insects are}} also consumed, {{especially}} in northern provinces. Eating insect {{is one of}} exotic culinary experience which highlighted tourists' visit to the country. Many traditional markets in Thailand has stalls dedicated on selling deep-fried grasshoppers, cricket (ching rit), bee larvae, silkworm (non mai), <b>ant</b> <b>eggs</b> (khai mot) and termites.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{predator}} to L. riparia is ants, as they prey on unattended eggs. Overlap of predation {{does occur}} between organisms though as the earwigs prey on the <b>ant</b> <b>eggs</b> as well, {{the effect of}} ants on earwigs seems to be greater than the reverse relationship, as populations of earwigs increase if the ant’s decrease.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ant</b> <b>eggs</b> are a {{high source}} of protein. 100 grams {{contains}} more than 8.2 grams of protein. It has less fat and calories than chicken eggs by containing only 2.6 grams of fat while chicken egg {{contains more than}} 11.7 grams. It contains other minerals such as; calcium, phosphorus, iron, sodium, potassium, vitamin B1, vitamin B2 and Niacin.|$|R
5000|$|The Apollo jewel {{butterfly}} (Hypochrysops apollo apollo) lays its eggs on the plant, {{and because}} they smell like <b>ant's</b> <b>eggs,</b> the <b>ants</b> carry the <b>eggs</b> inside the plant, where they develop to the butterfly stage. Hypochrysops is a genus of [...] "blues", butterflies in the family Lycaenidae, which is notorious for its myrmecophily. Accordingly, {{it is likely that}} the larvae that hatch from the eggs feed either on food begged from the ants, or on ant larvae, or possibly both. In either event, the butterfly finally emerges and flies off.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Ant</b> <b>eggs</b> (ไข่มดเเดง, [...] ) {{refer to}} both the eggs and pupae of weaver ants (known in Thailand as red ants), that are {{harvested}} and consumed as food in several countries across Southeast Asia, especially Laos and Northeastern Thailand (Isan). They are high in protein. Red ants eat mango leaves so their bodies taste like a squirt of lime, but their fresh eggs are fatty and sweet.|$|R
40|$|The {{informant}} demontrates {{and describes}} the preparation {{process and the}} application of a plant medicine made of a green ant's nest (Oecophylla smaragdina). The green <b>ants</b> nest, including <b>eggs,</b> larvae, and adult ants, built with the leaves of the paperbark tree (Melaleuca leucadendra) are used for the treatment of coughs and sore throats. Procedure: The branch on which the nest is built is broken off. The nest is then placed in a container of water, rubbing and squeezing it between the palms until the nest is broken and the <b>ants,</b> <b>eggs</b> and larvae are floating in the fluid. The leaves are removed and the liquid is drunk...|$|R
25|$|The {{municipal}} {{market is}} located a bit further south {{at the intersection}} of Jesus Cardozo and Rivapalacio Streets. The market mostly sells staple products for local consumption. It also contains food stands which sell local and regional specialties such as barbacoa, mole, quelites (a name for various types of edible greens), and dishes which contains local specialty ingredients such as wild mushrooms, escamoles, maguey flowers, <b>ant</b> <b>eggs</b> and “cupiches” (a kind of butterfly larvae).|$|R
5|$|Some larvae, {{especially}} those of the Lycaenidae, form mutual associations with ants. They communicate with the ants using vibrations that are transmitted through the substrate as well as using chemical signals. The ants provide some degree of protection to these larvae and they in turn gather honeydew secretions. Large blue (Phengaris arion) caterpillars trick Myrmica ants into taking {{them back to the}} ant colony where they feed on the <b>ant</b> <b>eggs</b> and larvae in a parasitic relationship.|$|R
25|$|In {{the state}} of Hidalgo, in which most maguey is grown, fields of this plant are disappearing, with barley taking its place. Most maguey plants here serve as {{boundary}} markers between properties. Many of these plants do not survive long, as they are often vandalized. An estimated 10,000 plants are mutilated each week by cutting off the lower leaves for barbacoa or destroying them completely {{to look for the}} edible white grubs or <b>ant</b> <b>eggs</b> that can inhabit them.|$|R
50|$|Liphyra brassolis {{grows in}} the nests of ants, {{especially}} of tree ants (Oecophylla smaragdina and other species). The caterpillar has tiny antennae-like structures whose function is not known. The adult butterfly at emergence is covered in grey powdery scales which protect it from the <b>ants.</b> <b>Eggs</b> are laid singly or in groups of about six, {{on the underside of}} branches of a tree with ants' nest. The eggs are tiny pale green cylinders of 1 mm height.|$|R
5000|$|Certain {{insects are}} also eaten in Thailand, {{especially}} in Isan {{and in the}} north. Many markets in Thailand feature stalls which sell deep-fried grasshoppers, crickets (ching rit), bee larvae, silkworm (non mai), <b>ant</b> <b>eggs</b> (khai mot) and termites. The culinary creativity even extends to naming: one tasty larva, which is also known under the name [...] "bamboo worm" [...] (non mai phai, Omphisa fuscidentalis), is colloquially called [...] "express train" [...] (rot duan) due to its appearance.|$|R

50|$|Traditional {{dishes of}} the area include barbacoa, carnitas, pulque, nopal cactus with eggs, beans with epazote and mixote but the area is known for dishes made with escamoles (<b>ant</b> <b>eggs)</b> as well as mezcal worms which are both seasonal. Street food such as gorditas is popular in the local markets.The most {{important}} museum in the municipality is the site museum for the Tula archeological site called the Jorge R. Acosta Museum, which is run by INAH.|$|R
60|$|It was {{drooping}} now, {{striking a}} sinister note. And if any shadow of doubt had remained {{as to how}} he was feeling, {{the way he was}} carrying on would have dispelled it. He was standing by the bed in pink pyjamas, waving his fists at the skylight. Through the glass, Gussie was staring down. His eyes were bulging and his mouth was open, giving him so striking a resemblance to some rare fish in an aquarium that one's primary impulse was to offer him an <b>ant's</b> <b>egg.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{defensive}} bombardier behaviour {{is never}} used against ants. Males of some species {{are attracted to}} lights during {{some parts of the}} season and are thought to disperse from one ant nest to another. Males are thought to be short-lived. These beetles feed on <b>ant</b> <b>eggs,</b> larvae and adults by piercing their mandibles into the abdomen or other soft part and sucking the contents. Apart from chemical mimicry and communication with their hosts, they also make use of vibrations. Several stridulatory structures are found in these beetles including alary-elytral, abdomen-femur and thorax-femur combinations of surfaces.|$|R
50|$|Myrmecophiles {{may have}} various roles in their host ant colony. Many consume waste {{materials}} in the nests, such as dead ants, dead larvae, or fungi growing in the nest. Some myrmecophiles, however, feed on the stored food supplies of ants, and a few are predatory on <b>ant</b> <b>eggs,</b> larvae, or pupae. Others benefit the ants by providing a food source for them. Most associations are facultative, benefiting one or both participants but not being necessary to their survival, but many myrmecophilous relationships are obligate, meaning {{one or the other}} participant requires the relationship for survival.|$|R
5000|$|Known for {{consuming}} exotic local specialty dishes, Bourdain has [...] "eaten sheep testicles in Morocco, <b>ant</b> <b>eggs</b> in Puebla, Mexico, a raw seal eyeball {{as part of}} {{a traditional}} Inuit seal hunt, and an entire cobra—beating heart, blood, bile, and meat—in Vietnam," [...] reported the Daily Freeman in 2010. According to Bourdain, the most disgusting thing he has ever eaten is a Chicken McNugget, though he has also declared that the unwashed warthog rectum he ate in Namibia and the fermented shark he ate in Iceland are among [...] "the worst meals of his life." ...|$|R
50|$|In captivity, {{their diets}} may include grass seeds, beans, nuts, fruits (apples, papaya, bananas, oranges, grapefruits, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, gooseberries, currants, rowans, elderberries, {{hawthorn}} berries, rose hips, cucumbers and tomatoes), and vegetables (spinach, Chinese cabbage, cress, roquette, kale, broccoli, carrots, alfalfa, peas, endive, and sweet potatoes), dandelions, chickweed, soaked corn, germinated sunflower seeds and spray millet. They may also eat fruit tree buds (elderberry bushes, willows, hawthorn, and aspen), <b>ant</b> <b>eggs,</b> mealworms or their substitutes (hard-boiled eggs, bread, biscuits, hard cheese or low-fat cottage cheese). Cuttle bones, mineral blocks, and gravel or ground oyster shells {{may be given}} to aid in mechanical digestion.|$|R
25|$|The {{developing}} spherical galls {{are green}} at first, brown later, and mature in August. Each gall contains a central chamber, {{with a single}} female wasp larva of the asexual generation, which emerges through a 'woodworm-like' hole as an adult winged gall-wasp in September. These asexual (agamic) females lay unfertilized eggs in the embryonic bud leaves of the Turkey oak, with galls slowly developing during winter, and are visible in March and April as small oval structures between the bud scales, looking like <b>ant's</b> <b>eggs</b> or pupae. The emerging adult gall-wasps in spring are the sexual generation, producing both males and females, which fly to the common oaks to initiate {{the formation of the}} summer marble gall.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the insects}} taste fairly bland when deep-fried, {{somewhat}} like popcorn and prawns. But when deep-fried together with kaffir lime leaves, chilies and garlic, the insects become an excellent snack {{to go with}} a drink. In contrast to the bland taste of most of these insects, the maeng da or maelong da na (Lethocerus indicus) has been described as having a very penetrating taste, similar to that of a very ripe gorgonzola cheese. This giant water bug is famously used in a chili dip called nam phrik maeng da. Some insects, such as tadpoles, <b>ant</b> <b>eggs</b> and silk worms, are also eaten boiled in a soup in Isan, or used in egg dishes in northern Thailand.|$|R

50|$|The banded {{woodpecker}} feeds singly or in pairs, foraging unobtrusively among {{vines and}} dense cover {{as well as}} higher in the canopy, probing into crevices, moss and epiphytes. The main items of diet are <b>ants,</b> their <b>eggs</b> and larvae, {{as well as other}} small invertebrates.|$|R
50|$|Lygosoma lineata, the lined writhing skink, is {{a species}} of writhing skink. It is known from India (the {{northern}} Western Ghats), Bangladesh and Myanmar (= Burma). This skink grows to about 6 cm in length. The body colouration is golden and each scale has a black dot forming longitudinal stripes on the body. It is known to occur from Gujarat to north of Karnataka. In Mumbai this skink has been observed in the Sanjay Gandhi national park and Aarey milk colony. It is often found under rocks, loose soil associated with termite mounds and ant hills. It is crepuscular. A captive individual accepted termites, mosquito, house flies, <b>ant</b> <b>eggs</b> for about 45 days and was released. One individual regurgitated a Typhlina when caught.|$|R
50|$|The Megopteran in ITV's Primeval uses an {{ovipositor}} {{evolved from}} either wasps or <b>ants</b> to lay <b>eggs</b> into its hosts.|$|R
5000|$|The cuisine of {{the state}} {{is similar to that of}} {{neighboring}} Hidalgo, Puebla and Federal District of Mexico City, featuring dishes such as barbacoa, mixiote, tamales, tacos, quesadillas and more. The state is known for the use of a number of ingredients in these dishes. One of these is the use of a number of edible insects, many of which are considered delicacies such as escamoles (<b>ant</b> <b>eggs)</b> and maguey larvae as well as others locally known as “padrecitos,” “mecapales,” “toritos” and “tenanas”. Vegetable items include a wide variety of mushrooms, often harvested from the wild, squash flowers, chilacayote, xoconostle (a kind of cactus fruit), nopal and epazote. Like neighboring Puebla, moles are an important element, especially for dishes made for special occasions. Two local versions include “mole prieto” and “mole de ladrillo.” ...|$|R
60|$|The {{great fear}} of the tempted is, {{that there is not}} so much grace in God, and that he is not so free of it as some scriptures seem to import. But this word PURE is {{levelled}} against such objections and objectors, for the destroying of their doubts, and the relieving of their souls. There is no fraud, nor guile, nor fable in the business; for though God is pleased to present us with his grace under the notion of a river, it is not to delude our fancies thereby; but to give us some small illustration of the exceeding riches of his grace, which as far, for quantity, outstrips the biggest rivers, as the most mighty mountain doth the least <b>ant's</b> <b>egg</b> or atom in the world.|$|R
5000|$|The pink-tailed worm-lizard (Aprasia parapulchella) {{is a rare}} legless lizard {{found in}} Australia. The animal looks like a {{combination}} of small snake and worm. The total length is up to 14 cm long. It has a pink tail and is white underneath. The head and neck is brown {{and the rest of}} the top of the body is pale grey. Scales on the back each have a dark bar, and so the appearance is dots down the back. It is found on two hills near Tarcutta, Bathurst, New South Wales, Bendigo in Victoria, and along the sides of the Molonglo River and Murrumbidgee River and on Mount Taylor in the Australian Capital Territory. [...] The lizards eat invertebrates that live under rocks. They can be found under rocks sized from 0.15 to 0.6 meters.Their main diet is <b>ant</b> <b>eggs,</b> particularly from Iridomyrmex species and Rhytidoponera metallica.|$|R
