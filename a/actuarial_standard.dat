40|$|AbstractHedging a {{contingent}} claim with an asset {{which is not}} perfectly correlated with the underlying asset results in unhedgeable residual risk. Even if the residual risk is considered diversifiable, the option writer is faced {{with the problem of}} uncertainty in the estimation of the drift rates of the underlying and the hedging instrument. If the residual risk is not considered diversifiable, then this risk can be priced using an <b>actuarial</b> <b>standard</b> deviation principle in infinitesimal time. In both cases, these models result in the same nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE). A fully implicit, monotone discretization method is developed for solution of this pricing PDE.

40|$|Motivation. This paper {{discusses}} how NCCI {{estimates the}} cost of capital in its ratemaking framework. The implementation of this actuarial concept in ratemaking is challenging because financial economics offers more than one model for estimating {{the cost of}} capital. And even where there is agreement on the model, there may be questions about how to measure the variables that enter the model. Method. The cost of equity capital is calculated using the discounted cash flow model (DCF) and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). The DCF method employs forecasts for the rate of dividend growth from Value Line Publishing, Inc. The CAPM model utilizes betas from Value Line Publishing, Inc., and historical returns on Treasury bills {{and the stock market}} from Morningstar, Inc. Results. Cost of capital estimates are provided based on data available as of November 4, 2010. The two approaches to measuring the cost of capital are conceptually different, yet yield similar results. Conclusions. NCCI relies on two concepts of estimating the cost of equity capital for ratemaking in workers compensation. Both approaches are recommended methods according to <b>Actuarial</b> <b>Standard</b> and Practice No. 30 (July 1997). Availability.

40|$|How should {{practicing}} actuaries consider materiality in {{the context}} of formal Statements of Actuarial Opinion? The specific issue ofmateriality has come to the forefront for easnalty actuaries recently with the requirements of <b>Actuarial</b> <b>Standard</b> of Practice (ASOP) 36. The Actuarial Standards Board Casualty Committee's Subcommittee on Reserves was involved in drafting ASOP 36. After its third draft, the Subcommittee held a heating on the proposed standard. There were many controversial issues expressed at the hearing, especially those involving materiality. While the Subcommittee admitted that a standard of practice on the topic ofmateriality itself was perhaps a good idea, the implementation of ASOP 36 went forward, despite pointed opposition by many actuaries. This paper will address materiality from external points of view (i. e., U. S. Supreme Court, Securities and Exchange Commission, Financial Accounting Standards Board), then present findings from research on material @ standards commonly used by both the actuarial and regulatory communities. Next, we present a framework for determining material @ thresholds {{in the context}} of the Statement of Actuarial Opinion for practicing actuaries ranging from the very simple (roles of thumb) to the more complex (stochastic modeling).

40|$|We are {{motivated}} by the latest statistical facts that weather directly affects about 20 % of the U. S. economy and, as a result energy companies experience enormous potential losses due to weather that is colder or warmer than expected for {{a certain period of}} a year. Incompleteness and illiquidity of markets renders hedging the exposure using energy as the underlying asset impossible. We attempt to price and hedge a written European call option with an asset that is highly correlated with the underlying asset; still, a significant amount of the total risk cannot be diversified. Yet, our analysis begins by considering hedging in a complete markets system that can be utilised as a theoretical point of reference, relative to which we can assess incompleteness. The Black-Scholes Model is introduced and the Monte Carlo approach is used to investigate the effects of three hedging strategies adopted; Delta hedging, Static hedging and a Stop-Loss strategy. Next, an incomplete system of markets is assumed and the Minimal Variance approach is demonstrated. This approach results in a non-linear PDE for the option price. We use the <b>actuarial</b> <b>standard</b> deviation principle to modify the PDE to account for the unhedgeable risk. Based on the derived PDE, two additional hedging schemes are examined: the Delta hedging and the Stop-loss hedging.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigated the}} effect of old age insurance (OAI) benefits {{on the distribution of}} lifetime income for persons retiring between 1961 and 1973. An <b>actuarial</b> <b>standard</b> of fairness was employed to assess the direction of redistribution {{and the extent to which}} the OAI program redistributed income across subgroups comprising the retirement cohort. It was hypothesized that socioeconomic status influenced the absolute size of the redistributional component because of differential survivorship rates and the differential treatment of certain identifiable groups, such as women, nonworking persons age 65 - 71, traditional family structures, and low-income household units. In addition, the distributional consequences of a 2 ̆ 2 maturing 2 ̆ 2 pay-as-you-go retirement system were examined;The distributional impact of the OAI program under legislation in effect in 1972 was isolated by decoupling the insurance portion of the OAI benefits from the redistribution portion. The decoupling was accomplished by estimating a series of annuity-type counterfactuals [...] person-specific estimates of actuarially fair benefit payments. The size of the annuity benefit received was dependent on the accumulated value of OAI contribution, the comprehensiveness of the income insurance purchased, and the degree to which the insurer could discriminate among beneficiaries. The annuity-type estimates and 1972 OAI benefit levels used to measure redistribution were based on data from the 1973 Current Population Survey [...] Administrative Record Exact Match File and the Longitudinal Social Security Earnings Exact Match File;All 1972 beneficiaries received more than their 2 ̆ 2 money 2 ̆ 7 s worth 2 ̆ 2 from the OAI program. In addition, the OAI program was found to be 2 ̆ 2 mildly 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 generally 2 ̆ 2 progressive across income groups, but it also exhibited strong regressive features, resulting in lower relative returns to middle-income beneficiaries. The regressive features were more pronounced with the introduction of the earning test and socioeconomic-adjusted mortality rates. Overall, the lower-income groups received the largest relative gains from the program, whereas the middle-income groups received the largest share of the intergenerational transfer. The size of the intergenerational transfer was found, in many cases, significantly associated with the following worker characteristics: lifetime earnings, service length, sex, age at retirement, year of retirement, and marital status...|$|E
