5|$|The train {{stopped at}} a station that had no town, and {{a short while later}} it passed the only banana {{plantation}} along the route that had its name written over the gate: Macondo. This word had attracted my attention ever since the first trips I had made with my grandfather, but I discovered only as an adult that I liked its poetic resonance. I never heard anyone say it and did not even <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> what it meant...I happened to read in an encyclopedia that it is a tropical tree resembling the Ceiba.|$|E
25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E
500|$|At Moscow, Kennan {{found the}} {{atmosphere}} even more regimented than on his previous trips, with police guards following him everywhere, discouraging contact with Soviet citizens. At the time, Soviet propaganda charged the U.S. with preparing for war, which Kennan did not wholly dismiss. [...] "I began to <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> whether... {{we had not}} contributed... by the overmilitarization of our policies and statements... to a belief in Moscow that it was war we were after, that we had settled for its inevitability, {{that it was only}} a matter of time before we would unleash it." ...|$|E
60|$|That's {{precisely}} what I've been <b>asking</b> <b>myself</b> {{ever since we}} landed in this God-forsaken swamp.|$|R

500|$|Gaga was {{the most}} {{nominated}} artist at 2010's Video Music Awards with a record thirteen nominations, including two nods for Video of the Year (the first female artist to achieve this feat). She arrived in an Alexander McQueen dress and changed into a Giorgio Armani number before donning her third and final outfit of the evening: a dress, hat, boots, and purse made of raw meat. Gaga wore the meat dress to accept her Video of the Year trophy for [...] "Bad Romance"; as she accepted the award from presenter Cher, she joked, [...] "I never thought I'd be asking Cher to hold my meat purse." [...] Gaga continued to wear the dress after the awards show for press photos and an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Gaga explained her interpretation of the dress to DeGeneres, stating, [...] "If we don’t {{stand up for what}} we believe in and if we don’t fight for our rights pretty soon we’re going to have as much rights as the meat on our bones." [...] "Now, I love Lady Gaga, but as someone who also loves animals, it was really difficult for me to sit next to Lady Gaga while she was wearing that outfit," [...] DeGeneres, who is vegan, later wrote. [...] "But it did make me <b>ask</b> <b>myself,</b> what's the difference between her outfit and an outfit made of leather?" ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{leaving her}} job as a {{reporter}} at the UPI, Thomas became more likely to air her personal, negative views. In a speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she quipped, [...] "I censored myself for 50 years when I was a reporter. Now I wake up and <b>ask</b> <b>myself,</b> 'Who do I hate today?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|At a Cannes press conference, {{after the}} {{identity}} of the donor was revealed, Moore said: [...] "I had to <b>ask</b> <b>myself,</b> 'Would you write this check if this wasn't in the film?' I decided this is what I would do, and what I should do, {{and this is the way}} I want Americans to live." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've been <b>asking</b> <b>myself</b> that {{question}} ever since I came, Mr. Gaylord," [...] said Austen, [...] "and I haven't yet arrived at any conclusion." ...|$|R
6000|$|I <b>asked</b> <b>myself</b> whether, {{by making}} a brave attempt, they might not force their way past the French fleet, and thus escape by the sea? ...|$|R
6000|$|Was it possible, I <b>asked</b> <b>myself,</b> {{that we were}} mistaken? Had {{we allowed}} {{ourselves}} to be blinded by suspicion, and was Job Lord all he professed? ...|$|R
2500|$|Le Pen {{has made}} several provocative {{statements}} concerning the Holocaust {{which have been}} interpreted by the legal system as constituting Holocaust denial. He has been convicted of racism or inciting racial hatred at least six times. Thus, on 13 September 1987 he said, [...] "I <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> several questions. I'm not saying the gas chambers didn't exist. I haven't seen them myself. I haven't particularly studied the question. But I believe it's just a detail {{in the history of}} World War II." [...] He was condemned under the Gayssot Act to pay 1.2 million francs (183,200 euros).|$|E
2500|$|Ellison {{graduated}} in 1981 from the University of Detroit Jesuit High School and Academy, {{where he was}} active in sports and a senator in the student government. At the age of 19, while attending Wayne State University in Detroit, Ellison converted from Catholicism to Islam, later giving the following explanation: [...] "I can't claim that I was the most observant Catholic at the time [...] I had begun to really look around and <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> about the social circumstances of the country, issues of justice, issues of change. When I looked at my spiritual life, and I looked at what might inform social change, justice in society... I found Islam." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{revealed}} that {{after she had}} quit University and moved to London, England to focus on her music, she had completely changed her Personal Appearance. She said; [...] "Doing medicine, I {{had to be very}} conservative in how I looked and dressed. But arriving in London from Scotland, it seemed appropriate to <b>ask</b> <b>myself,</b> OK, if you're no longer a medic, who are you?" [...] Sandé took her middle name Emeli on professionally two years before she hit the limelight as Adele had just risen to prominence. [...] "I changed it as soon as Adele came out. I just thought, 'You've kind of taken the [...] now', so I went with my middle name. She was just getting bigger and bigger, so I thought I just really need it." ...|$|E

60|$|During refreshments, I {{noticed that}} Mrs. Wilbur was both fascinated and annoyed at the {{sensation}} {{the girl was}} producing. Where would the matter end? I <b>asked</b> <b>myself.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "To be frank, I have <b>asked</b> <b>myself</b> the question, and couldn't {{be quite}} {{sure it was}} {{altogether}} because {{she wanted me to}} get this unfortunate steamboat off." ...|$|R
2500|$|Additionally, {{the turmoil}} that Sue {{had been through}} had led Ratcliff to {{consider}} quitting the serial prematurely. In 1987 she told the magazine Woman's Own, [...] "'s been such an unhappy woman since Hassan died. And {{it was beginning to}} rub off on me. I'd go to work, six days a week, be stuck in that grim little cafe and be permanently miserable. I got to the stage when I started to <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> if I really wanted to spend all my working life playing a misery." [...] However, according to Ratcliff, the scriptwriters decision to make Sue pregnant changed her mind about leaving. She said, [...] "Now Sue is pregnant and happy I feel differently about the role. So maybe {{it would be fun to}} stick around for a couple more years - if I'm wanted." ...|$|E
2500|$|This led Morgan to ask Morley {{about the}} League of Nations: [...] "A mirage, {{and an old}} one". Morgan asked: [...] "How {{are you going to}} enforce it?", whereupon Morley replied: [...] "How indeed? One may as well talk of London {{morality}} being due to the Archbishop of Canterbury. But take away Scotland Yard!" [...] When asked in 1919 about the Covenant of the League of Nations Morley said: [...] "I have not read it, and I don't intend to read it. It's not worth the paper it's written on. To the end of time it'll always be a case of 'Thy head or my head'. I've no faith in these schemes". When a prominent Liberal praised someone as [...] "a good European" [...] Morley remarked: [...] "When I lay me down at night or rise in the morning I do not <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> if I am a good European". Towards the close of 1919 he was worried about Britain's guarantee to France: ...|$|E
6000|$|Madame Munster {{looked at}} him again; and then, smiling: [...] "And I have {{certainly}} had time, since I got here, to <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> why I came. However, I never <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> idle questions. Here I am, {{and it seems to}} me you ought only to thank me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{was just}} <b>asking</b> <b>myself</b> what that fool {{was staring at}} this house for, and {{thinking}} of telling him it was impolite to stare, when I recognised the house's owner.' ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{still that}} scene haunted me. And still, even in sleep, I <b>asked</b> <b>myself</b> {{over and over}} again, [...] "How on earth can this be? What's {{the meaning of the}} baby?" ...|$|R
60|$|FRANK [with his prettiest lyrical cadence] Precisely what I {{was going}} to <b>ask,</b> <b>myself,</b> in my own graceful fashion.|$|E
6000|$|... "I picture them convinced. I <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> {{what would}} be their natural course of action. Without a doubt, they would sell wheat." ...|$|E
60|$|They seemed amazingly busy. I {{began to}} <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> {{what they could}} be. Were they {{intelligent}} mechanisms? Such a thing I felt was impossible. Or did a Martian sit within each, ruling, directing, using, much as a man's brain sits and rules in his body? I began to compare the things to human machines, to <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> {{for the first time}} in my life how an ironclad or a steam engine would seem to an intelligent lower animal.|$|E
6000|$|My heart sank; {{perhaps my}} idiotic jest had indeed driven him away; and again I <b>asked</b> <b>myself,</b> [...] "Why?" [...] and whirled {{for a moment}} in a vortex of untenable hypotheses.|$|R
60|$|RICHARD (gaily). Upon my life, Mrs. Anderson, I don't know. I've been <b>asking</b> <b>myself</b> that {{question}} ever since; and I {{can find no}} manner of reason for acting as I did.|$|R
60|$|Altogether, I {{remember}} {{my life with}} Marion as a long distress, now hard, now tender. It was in those days that I first became critical {{of my life and}} burdened with a sense of error and maladjustment. I would lie awake in the night, <b>asking</b> <b>myself</b> the purpose of things, reviewing my unsatisfying, ungainly home-life, my days spent in rascal enterprise and rubbish-selling, contrasting all I was being and doing with my adolescent ambitions, my Wimblehurst dreams. My circumstances had an air of finality, and I <b>asked</b> <b>myself</b> in vain why I had forced myself into them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my life," [...] said Mr. Traveller, [...] "I {{was made}} to <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> that very {{question}} {{only a few minutes}} ago--by a Tinker too." ...|$|E
6000|$|It's {{odd that}} I heard {{this at the}} time with unutterable contempt, and now that I recall it--well, I <b>ask</b> <b>myself,</b> what have I got better? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I passed within twenty {{inches of}} the door. 'If I say good-night to them, and go in,' I <b>asked</b> <b>myself,</b> 'what will happen?' And I was all a-tingle for that word with Gurker.|$|R
6000|$|Directly I had uttered {{these words}} I <b>asked</b> <b>myself</b> angrily why the deuce did I {{want to say}} that? Mr. Burns in answer had only blinked at me. What on earth did he mean? ...|$|R
60|$|Was it {{possible}} (I <b>asked</b> <b>myself)</b> {{that he could}} put his case against Miss Rachel and Rosanna in a more horrid point of view than this? It WAS possible, as you shall now see.|$|R
