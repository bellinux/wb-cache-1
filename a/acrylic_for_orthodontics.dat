40|$|Methyl methracrylate (MMA) is used widely {{for basic}} {{material}} in dental clinics. One {{of them is}} cold curing resin <b>acrylic</b> <b>for</b> <b>orthodontics</b> removable appliance. MMA is potentially to have the character to irritate and give an allergic reaction to oral mucous. Previous study showed that MMA {{have an effect on}} mitchondrial dehydrogenase repithelial cells by losing its hydrogen and tight on this enzyme. The influence of cold curing resins acrylic on DNA synthesis of oral mucous epithelial is not known until at present. The purpose of this in-vitro study is to examine the DNA synthesis of fibroblast cells BHK- 21 induced MMA. The result {{of this study is to}} increase the DNA synthesis from the cell culture induced MMA monomer at an incubation time of 12 and 18 hours. Toxicity of MMA was proved to increase DNA synthesis because DNA has a more sensitive effect as a toxic material may cause a deviation of oral mucous. </span...|$|E

Group 3 underwent laser treatment (80 [*]mJ, 4 [*]Hz), followed by 37 % orthophosphoric acid for 30 seconds. The teeth in Group 4 were treated with laser at 40 [*]mJ and 10 [*]Hz. The teeth in Group 5 were treated with laser (40 [*]mJ, 10 [*]Hz), followed by 37 % orthophosphoric acid for 30 seconds. The adhesive remnant index was determined after debonding. Results. Kruskas-Wallis test showed that location parameters (median and mean) are significantly different between Groups 2 and 4 when compared with control group; on the contrary no significant difference was detected between Groups 3 and 5 with the controls.

40|$|Introduction: Braces is the {{treatment}} of choice for malocclusion. However, in recent years malocclusion no longer serves as the reason behind the orthodontic treatment. Many people use it for the fashion purposes {{and some of them}} got it from a dental quack. The {{purpose of this study was}} to understand factors that influenced citizen of Bandung to go to dental quack practice <b>for</b> <b>orthodontics</b> treatment. Methods: Cross-sectional study with purposive sampling technique consisting of 30 samples. Inclusion criteria were subject wearing metal braces from dental quack, live within area of Bandung, and willing to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria was subjects that refused to participate in the study. Results: The study showed that 73 % of the subjects use {{the treatment}} for aligning teeth over getting along with the trend or the perception of beauty from using colorful bracket rubber. 63 % chose a dental quack because of the suggestions from friends who had done it before them. Low income combined with the need <b>for</b> <b>orthodontics</b> treatment and inadequate information about dental braces influencing subjects choice to go to a dental quack. The study showed that socioeconomic environment highly influenced the decision to wear braces from a dental quack. Conclusion: The low price factor was the main reason for dental quack braces highly demanded. Common people need to be educated to get proper treatment for malocclusion and to go for improper provider of dental treatment...|$|R

The app American Journal of Orthodontics & Dentofacial Orthopedics, AJO-DO provides access to AJO-DO, a monthly clinical journal published by AJO-DO.

50|$|He {{was born}} in Elk River, Idaho. He {{received}} his college degree in 1936 from College of Wooster, Ohio. After graduation here, he entered Case School of Dental Medicine under the mentorship of his father who was the current Dean of the college at that time. He earned his dental degree in 1940. He then pursued his degree in Orthodontics and finally received his Masters from University of Illinois at Chicago College of Dentistry in 1942. After that he served as the Chairman of the Orthodontic Department at the UCSF School of Dentistry until 1956.

50|$|He {{initially}} {{studied the}} process of tooth movement and his published his work in Dental Cosmos in 1876. His published work was titled Regulation of the Teeth made easy by the Positive System and he theorized that pressure moved teeth. He further published his work in Dental Cosmos in 1888 and 1898 where his work contained over 1400 pen and ink sketches drawn by him. These sketches, pertaining to tooth movement at that time, were important to orthodontics as a profession and the knowledge in the field.

CBCT examination {{can be used}} to determine the volume of bone needed for grafting and the adequacy of the bone fill after surgery (Fig.  12). The smallest volume size compatible with the situation should be selected because of the reduced radiation dose [6]. A large FOV CBCT should not be used routinely for orthodontic diagnosis. For complex cases of skeletal abnormality, particularly those requiring combined orthodontic/surgical management, a large FOV CBCT may be justified for planning the definitive procedure, particularly where MSCT is the current imaging method of choice [6]. In a recent systematic review of CBCT applications in orthodontics, no high-quality evidence regarding the benefits of CBCT use in orthodontics was found [44].|$|R
