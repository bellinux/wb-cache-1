50|$|The {{youngest}} of eight {{children born to}} Protestant parents, he had a puritanical and overprotective upbringing, his mother being sexually repressive. Green received a Calvinist education in his religious education as a child, but became a Roman Catholic in 1916, two years after his mother's death. The following year, still only 16, he volunteered his services as an ambulanceman in the American Field Service. When his age was discovered his enlistment was annulled. He immediately signed up with an ambulance unit of the American Red Cross, and when that six-month term of service ended in 1918, he enlisted in the French Army, in which {{he served as a}} second lieutenant of artillery until 1919. After the war, he spent three years (1919-22) at the University of Virginia at the invitation of his uncle—his mother’s brother—Walter Hartridge. It was his first direct encounter with the United States. He discovered the South, where both his parents had been born. He returned to France in 1922, where, after a false start as a painter, he {{began his career as a}} French writer, and by 1927 had established himself in the world of French literature. His career as a major figure of 20th-century French literature began soon after his return from the United States with the novel Mont-Cinère (1926), which was well received by Georges Bernanos. In July 1940, after France's defeat, he went back to America. In 1942, he was mobilized and sent to New York to work at the United States Office of War Information. From there, for almost a year, five times a week, he would <b>address</b> <b>France</b> as part of the radio broadcasts of Voice of America, working inter alia with André Breton and Yul Brynner. Green returned to France after World War II.|$|E

30|$|In this context, Castel (2000 a, 2000 b) {{for example}} raises the question, where {{discontinuous}} career paths {{and the potential}} threat of social exclusion through precarious workplaces or implications for those, being out of the workforce for longer periods are leading. Despite {{the fact that the}} author particularly <b>addresses</b> <b>France,</b> other authors (Kalleberg 2009; Scherer 2004; Kalleberg et al. 2000) as well deal with similar questions regarding the future of social cohesion through atypical employment or rather non-standard employment relationships. The adjustments made in terms of part-time work, the expansion of temporary work and other changes indicate an increased flexibility in the external labor market. Numerous employment relationships in the internal labor market, which still are legally and formally standard employment relationships, for instance by individual working-times, flexible payments, sabbaticals and others, do not longer comply {{with the idea of a}} traditional standard employment relationship (Pierenkemper 2009, p.  14). Against this background, a certain decrease of structural rigidities regarding the working relationship for the core workforce is observable today.|$|R

40|$|Borders, more in {{than in the}} past, {{determine}} the way Europe contemplates itself {{and how it is}} perceived by others. While internal borders seem to disappear, the pressure on Europe’s external borders increases significantly. Migration concerns have led to an inward looking stance and the term border as a territorial limit, acquires a different meaning. On the Mediterranean frontier, the route between North Africa and Europe, European identity is most visible {{and at the same time}} most challenged. This research refers to three notions of space, determined by borders in Migrant literature and recaps this to the current postcolonial immigration debate. It discusses how identities are constructed through shifting borders and how borders form the basis of a new literary space. In Wedding by the Sea (Bruiloft aan Zee) by Abdelkader Benali, the protagonist living in the Netherlands returns to Morocco for a family wedding and faces questions of home and belonging right at the Moroccan border towns. Assia Djebar’s novel Het Verloren Woord (La disparition de la langue Francaise) touches upon these very same questions when the protagonist returns to Algeria after living in France for more than twenty years. It also <b>addresses</b> <b>France’s</b> colonial legacy and how this past influences feelings of home and belonging...|$|R
5000|$|Hébert was not {{the only}} writer during the French Revolution to use the image of Père Duchesne nor was he the only author in the period to adopt foul {{language}} as a way of appealing to the working class. Another writer at the time, Lemaire, also wrote a newspaper entitled Père Duchêne (although he spelt it differently than Hébert [...] ) from September 1790 until May 1792 in which he assumed the voice of a [...] "moderate patriot" [...] who wanted to conserve the relationship between the king and the nation. Lemaire's character also used a slew of profanities and would <b>address</b> <b>France's</b> military. Hébert's paper, however, became far more popular. In part, this was due to the Paris Commune deciding to buy his papers and distribute them to the French military for distribution to soldiers in training. For example, starting in 1792 the Paris Commune and the ministers of war Jean-Nicolas Pache and, later, Jean Baptiste Noël Bouchotte bought several thousand copies of Le Père Duchesne which were distributed free to the public and troops. This happened again in May and June 1793 when the Minister of War bought copies of newspapers in order to [...] "enlighten and animate their patriotism." [...] It is estimated that Hébert received 205,000 livres from this purchase.|$|R

40|$|This {{comparative}} {{cultural history}} of urban photography <b>addresses</b> <b>France,</b> Britain and West Germany {{during the period}} of reconstruction after the Second World War. It considers images circulating in the public sphere (including books, professional journals, popular magazines and official publications) and examines how the mediation through photography of architecture, urban space and everyday life shaped ways of seeing and thinking about cities in postwar Western Europe. Analysis focuses on four key fields: ruin photography in commemorative books (1945 - 49); representations of mass housing projects through architectural photography in the architectural press and official publications (1947 - 54); urban scenes in photographic magazines (1949 - 55); and urban photography in UNESCO’s early campaigns regarding human rights and intercultural understanding, as well as images of the institution’s purpose-built headquarters in Paris (1949 - 58). Whether of burned-out façades or sunlit concrete tower blocks, the wealth of publicly circulating images cohered in a set of specific discursive formations which, in dynamic and productive relation with one another, offered determinate perspectives on key topics of the reconstruction period. Moreover, in the transition from enmity to unity between the comparator nations which characterised the aftermath of total war and the escalation of the Cold War, the image of the city became a vital component of postwar Western European cultural identity facilitating the expression of important imagined communities, spaces and futures. Informed by the interdisciplinary field of photography studies, this research offers an interpretive analysis of dominant discursive formations, identifying the perspectives offered by postwar urban photography and excavating its relation to questions of cultural memory and forgetting, to national histories and imagined transnational communities, and to international relations and utopian thinking. It develops an innovative methodology for the interpretation of photography in the writing of cultural history and delivers a comparative historical analysis of a vital aspect of transnational postwar visual culture...|$|R
