5|$|Wendy {{caused a}} large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> in central Japan. The storm flooded {{thousands}} {{of homes and}} damaged significant tracts of land. Some rivers overflowed and hundreds of bridges were destroyed. Overall, 28 people were killed, and 19 were missing.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} World War II the Japanese {{fire balloon}} was {{designed}} as a cheap weapon intended {{to make use of the}} jet stream over the Pacific Ocean to reach the west coast of Canada and the United States. They were relatively ineffective as weapons, but they were used in one of the few attacks on North America during World War II, causing six deaths and a small <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Allied {{losses are}} given at Evere as 32 fighters, 22 {{twin-engine}} aircraft and 13 four-engine aircraft destroyed, plus another nine single, six twin and one four-engine aircraft damaged. In total, II./JG 26 losses included 13 Fw 190s destroyed and two damaged. Nine of its pilots were missing; five {{were killed and}} four captured. III./JG 26 lost six Bf 109s and four pilots. Only {{one of them was}} captured, the remainder were killed. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> the Germans inflicted made up for the losses; the Evere strike was a success.|$|E
50|$|The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> <b>of</b> £11,460 {{awarded to}} Hyde were reduced after further {{action by the}} Commissioners. They did not {{question}} the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> on the land and buildings that had been awarded against them, but they did question the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> on the water for the motive power for the mill. The Supreme Court directed a new trial unless Mary agreed to reduce the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> the <b>damages</b> {{that she had been}} awarded, to which she consented. The fight was not yet over, however, as there was still the issue <b>of</b> the contingent <b>damages</b> <b>of</b> £7,200 to which she believed she was entitled.|$|R

5|$|Although Chell is {{equipped}} with mechanized heel springs to prevent damage from falling, she can be killed by various other hazards in the test chambers, such as turret guns, bouncing balls of energy, and toxic liquid. She can also be killed by objects falling through portals, and {{by a series of}} crushers that appear in certain levels. Unlike most action games at the time, there is no health indicator; Chell dies if she is dealt a certain <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> in a short time period, but returns to full health fairly quickly. Some obstacles, such as the energy balls and crushing pistons, deal fatal damage with a single blow.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone John {{extensively}} {{affected areas}} of Western Australia, but damage {{was not as}} bad as expected. Widespread power outages across the Pilbara region were caused by John. Strong winds caused minor damage to infrastructure across the coast, as well as tree damage. 140windmills were destroyed by the cyclone on the coast. Further inland, rainfall associated with the cyclone and its remnants brought flooding, which flooded 25houses and caused rivers to overflow. The system was responsible for no deaths and a limited <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage.</b> After the season, the name John was retired from the Australian tropical cyclone naming list.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{its life}} as a {{tropical}} cyclone, Ewiniar affected Yap and Palau, which fall under the warning jurisdiction of the National Weather Service office in Tiyan, Guam. Ewiniar caused coastal flooding in Yap of up to 5feet (1.5m), especially near the port and around the Colonia Bay area. Ewiniar also caused an island-wide power outage in Yap, although according to an NWS post-storm report, damage was minimised on Yap due to steadier structures after Super Typhoon Sudal of 2004 tore through the islands. Damage was also reported to agriculture due to salt spray. The total <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> caused {{was estimated to be}} just over $100 thousand (2006USD).|$|E

50|$|The {{court also}} upheld the award of $22,500 in {{statutory}} damages against the defendant, noting that this amount represented the minimum award provided under the statute for works (such as the plaintiffs') {{that had been}} published with an adequate copyright notice. The court rejected the defendant's argument that the Seventh Amendment guaranteed her {{the right to a}} jury trial as to the appropriate <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>damages.</b> The court reasoned, in essence, that where the plaintiff sought only the minimum <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> provided under the statute, there were no disputed issues as to the proper <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> for a jury to resolve, and the issue <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> was appropriate for summary resolution. Finally, the court upheld the district court's permanent injunction against the defendant's downloading of copyrighted works.|$|R
5|$|Every {{game in the}} SmackDown vs. Raw series used to {{have the}} <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> inflicted to the player's chosen superstar, {{measured}} with a meter on the HUD, where a design of a male figure presented the damage. As a move was performed against a superstar, the affected area of the body flashed—the more damage that is done to that specific body part, {{the more likely it}} is for the superstar to submit. Colors were used to represent the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> done to a specific body area; yellow represented minimal damage, orange represented moderate damage, and red represented maximum damage. This was however taken out of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010. Now the only way to tell how damaged the opponent is to watch their physical body actions that indicate how hurt they are. The more damage inflicted to opponents, {{the more likely it is}} for them to lose the match. There are four ways to win a match in every game: by pinfall, submission, knockout, countout; alternatively, the match could end in a draw. With the introduction of an on-screen referee in WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It, the ability to win by disqualification was also included.|$|E
5|$|Gusty winds in Grenada damaged {{at least}} 34 roofs and knocked down twelve trees and six {{electrical}} poles. Additionally, {{a nursing home}} on the island was evacuated due to significant structural damage. Two houses lost their roofs in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, while moderate crop damage was reported on the island. Downed trees and power lines in Tobago left 90% of the island without electricity. Overall, Earl was responsible for one fatality, nineteen missing, and an unknown <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Intermittent torrents {{battered}} Saint Kitts and Nevis for {{at least}} four days; a total of up to 10.99inches (279mm) of precipitation was recorded during that time. Several homeowners reported significant flooding, and a number of persons had to be rescued from their homes. Gusty winds generated rough sea conditions along coastal regions, resulting in some beach erosion and the collapse of a sidewalk section. Rains and associated floods topped a number of culverts and bridges, washed out the sides of some roadways, and damage to some utility lines, followed by significant disruptions to electricity services. The exact <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> to the territory remains unknown, however.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many other}} organisms, {{increasing}} ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation due to stratospheric ozone depletion {{and other factors}} may harm the DNA of amphibians, particularly their eggs. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> depends upon the life stage, the species type and other environmental parameters. Salamanders and frogs that produce less photolyase, an enzyme that counteracts DNA damage from UVB, {{are more susceptible to}} the effects of loss of the ozone layer. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation may not kill a particular species or life stage but may cause sublethal damage.|$|E
5|$|Mary {{caused a}} {{significant}} <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> in Hong Kong and China. It {{was considered the}} worst storm to hit Hong Kong since the typhoon in 1937. The storm destroyed weak shacks made by refugees from the mainland, leaving thousands homeless. There were multiple landslides, {{and most of the}} infrastructure were damaged. More than 400 small watercraft were either damaged or destroyed. In China, dikes and dams were damaged severely, multiple public buildings collapsed, and destroyed large swaths of farmland. Significant wind and rain was also reported in Taiwan. More than 1,600 people died during the storm.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Joni {{impacted}} {{the island}} nations of Tuvalu and Fiji, while it also threatened the Fijian dependency of Rotuma and the French territory of Wallis and Futuna. The {{majority of the}} Tuvaluan islands suffered minor damage from Joni, while in Fiji the system caused a moderate to severe <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage.</b> Due {{to the impact of}} this system, the name Joni was subsequently retired, from the list of names for the region by the World Meteorological Organization. This would normally mean that the name would not be used again in the region, however, the name remained on the list and was used during the 2008–09 season.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the stages, {{the player}} may enter doors to access seven {{different}} types of chambers. Stores and black markets offer items in exchange for hearts, which are left behind by defeated monsters. Treasure chambers contain items, enemy nests give the player an opportunity to earn extra hearts, and hot springs restore Pit's health. In the god's chamber, the strength of Pit's bow and arrow may be increased depending on several factors, such {{as the number of}} enemies defeated and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> taken in battle. In the training chamber, Pit will be awarded with one of the three power items if he passes a test of endurance.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{comes in}} the form of both avoidable random {{encounters}} and scripted fights where the camera is fixed within the fighting area: enemies and bosses are primarily drawn from Japanese folklore and mythology. Battles are triggered only when enemies are near, with the player character otherwise keeping their weapons sheathed. In combat, characters attack and guard using a single-button prompt, while another button accesses items such as healing potions. Continuously attacking triggers combos. Different moves include sword slashes combined with directional buttons, which have different effects such as throwing an enemy into the air with an upward slash. Additional offensive items such as smoke bombs are acquired during the course of the game. At the end of each battle, experience points are awarded to the player character depending on how fast the battle was finished: leveling up increases a character's health, stats, and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> inflicted upon enemies.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{takes place}} in real-time. Located {{at the bottom of}} the screen is a power bar, a gauge that determines the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> done to an enemy when attacking. Swinging a weapon causes the gauge to empty and then quickly recharge, {{allowing}} that character to attack at full strength. The party wields eight different types of weaponry: sword, spear, bow, axe, boomerang, glove, whip, and javelin. All weapons can be upgraded eight times, and repeated use of a weapon increases its skill level to a maximum of eight, unlocking a new special attack with each level. Weapons are upgraded with Weapon Orbs, which are found in dungeons or earned by defeating certain bosses. The player takes each Orb to a blacksmith, located in most towns, who uses it to reforge one weapon.|$|E

5|$|Danny {{is notable}} for its extreme rainfall, the tornadoes {{generated}} by it, {{and the destruction}} it produced on its path, causing a total of nine fatalities and $ (1997USD, $ USD) in damage. The storm dropped a record amount of rainfall for Alabama, as at least 36.71inches (932mm) fell on Dauphin Island. Flooding, power outages, and erosion occurred {{in many areas of}} the Gulf Coast, and rescues had to be executed from flooded roadways. Tornadoes generated by Danny on the East Coast caused a great <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage.</b> Of the nine fatalities caused by Danny, one happened off the coast of Alabama, four occurred in Georgia, two occurred in South Carolina, and two occurred in North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|During the game, {{the player}} {{controls}} the onscreen character from a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} people, objects, and enemies. Like previous games in the series and most role-playing games, characters level up each time they earn a set number of experience points from defeating enemies; each level gained increases the character's statistics, thus improving their performance in battle. Statistic examples include hit points, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> a character can receive; magic points, which {{determine the number of}} times a character can use magical attacks; strength, the power of a character's physical attacks; and intelligence, the power of a character's magical spells. Upon encountering an enemy, the player can use a variety of weapons to attack and defeat the enemy. Despite the game being set in 2036, the weapon choices are largely medieval, including swords, axes, and spears, although handguns and a rocket-propelled grenade are available. These weapons differ in their damage output, the range of the weapon, and the speed of the attack.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 2011, there were two {{accidents}} (one serious) caused by what {{is believed to be}} loose objects hitting riders while riding the roller coaster. The most serious accident was when a man got struck with an object and had to get his eye removed due to the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage.</b> On the same day that the man got hit, Universal Studios announced that the coasters would not duel until an investigation was completed. For two months the coasters were dispatched separately and in mid-October 2011, Universal made the decision to remove the dueling aspect of the ride permanently without any explanation to what caused the injuries. No injuries have been reported since.|$|E
