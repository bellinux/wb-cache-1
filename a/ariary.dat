5|$|A popular tourist destination, Ambohimanga {{received}} 97,847 {{visitors in}} 2011. Visitors to the World Heritage Site are charged a fee (10,000 <b>ariary</b> for foreigners and 400 <b>ariary</b> for locals), which is largely {{used to pay}} for the preservation of the site. The commune of Ambohimanga Rova is a small but thriving rural village that lives on agriculture and services provided to tourists and pilgrims who visit the royal city. Multilingual tour guides can be hired at the site to provide detailed descriptions of its features and history. Photographs are permitted outdoors but prohibited inside the historic buildings. Tourism has been negatively affected at the site {{as a consequence of the}} 2009 Malagasy political crisis; management of the site has also been hampered by political instability and reduced revenues since 2009.|$|E
5|$|Rajoelina faced {{significant}} {{challenges in}} {{his tenure as}} mayor. Upon taking office, he was confronted with redressing the city's treasury, which had accumulated 8.2 billion Malagasy <b>Ariary</b> (approximately 4.6 million U.S. dollars) in debts under previous mayors, including Ravalomanana himself. Beginning 4 January 2008, Ravalomanana ordered water cutoffs at public pumps and brownouts of Antananarivo's street lights run by the state utilities company Jirama, due to 3.3 million <b>ariary</b> of unpaid debts to Jirama by the City of Antananarivo. Rajoelina responded by condemning the move as political and proceeded to undertake an audit that identified and addressed long-standing procedural irregularities and issues of corruption within the city's administration. Following a series of crimes against members of Rajoelina's inner circle in 2008 that comprised the burgling of his cabinet director's car, the kidnapping and ransoming {{of one of his}} special advisers, and the death of an assistant under mysterious circumstances, rumors spread that the Rajoelina administration was being deliberately intimidated by supporters of the president.|$|E
5|$|The HAT under Rajoelina's {{leadership}} affected highly visible, concrete {{activities that}} appealed to popular concerns. Rajoelina occasionally organized events to distribute basic items to groups of poor recipients, including medicines, clothing, house maintenance materials and school supplies. Rajoelina's administration also spent billions of <b>ariary</b> to subsidize basic needs like electricity, petrol, and food staples. Public works construction projects featured prominently among Rajoelina's activities. In 2010, two years after Rajoelina launched the project as mayor of Antananarivo, the HAT completed {{the reconstruction of the}} Hotel de Ville (town hall) of Antananarivo which had been destroyed by arson during the rotaka political protests of 1972. Also in 2010, Rajoelina oversaw the construction of a hospital built to international standards in Toamasina. Through its trano mora ("cheap house") initiative, the HAT built several subsidized housing developments intended for young middle class couples. Numerous other construction projects were planned or completed, including the restoration of historic staircases in Antananarivo built in the 19th century during the reign of Queen Ranavalona I, renovation of Toamasina's two main markets and its principal boulevard, repaving of the heavily traveled road between Toamasina and Foulpointe, and the construction of a 15,000-capacity municipal stadium and new town hall in Toamasina.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the same}} day, Malagasy navy troops called for Rajoelina's {{resignation}} by 25 March, threatening {{to use force}} otherwise to protect the constitution of Madagascar. According to their statement, the navy troops [...] "condemn all violence against civilians" [...] committed by the army corps in March and denounce Rajoelina for the [...] "civil war occurring in Madagascar". The navy troops claimed that there was [...] "irrefutable" [...] evidence that Rajoelina had paid the army corps {{hundreds of millions of}} <b>ariaries</b> and that they should face trials in accordance with military law. The navy troops called for other nations not to get involved in what they considered a purely domestic affair.|$|R

For example, twice in 2009 ministerial orders permitted the export of rosewood and ebony, but only if traders {{were willing to pay}} a fine of 72 million <b>ariary,</b> or $35,500, per container of illegally harvested wood. Malagasy law calls for the confiscation of illegal wood, not fines. Furthermore, these ministerial orders do not hold legal precedence over Malagasy law. However, the money from these fines will be used to fund the task force that will attempt to combat illegal logging.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the {{political}} crisis that began in 2009 and the resulting breakdown of law and order in Madagascar, poachers have hunted lemurs in the Daraina area and sold them to local restaurants as a delicacy. [...] Pictures of dead lemurs that had been smoked for transport were taken by Fanamby and released by Conservation International in August 2009. [...] The lemurs in the photographs included the endangered golden-crowned sifaka, as well as crowned lemurs. [...] Around the time the photographs were released, 15 people were arrested for selling smoked lemurs, which were bought from hunters for 1,000 <b>ariary,</b> or around US$0.53, and then sold in restaurants for 8,000 <b>ariary</b> (US$4.20). [...] Russell Mittermeier, president of Conservation International, said that the arrests would not end the poaching since the poachers would [...] "just get slaps on the wrist".|$|E

Rajoelina was sworn in as President on 21 March at Mahamasina stadium before a crowd of 40,000 supporters. He was 35 years of age when sworn in, making him the youngest president in the country's history and the youngest head of government in the world at that time.|$|E
500|$|Antananarivo has {{suffered}} from debt and mismanagement. The CUA estimated in 2012 {{that the cost of}} running the city to international standards would reach [...] annually, while annual revenues average around $12 million. In good years, the CUA is able to reserve $1–2 million to spend on city improvement projects. By 2008, the city's treasury had accumulated 8.2 billion Malagasy ariaryapproximately in debts under previous mayors. In 2008, water was cut off at public pumps and there were regular brownouts of city's street lights because of 3.3 million <b>ariary</b> of unpaid debts to the Jirama public utilities company by the City of Antananarivo. In response, then-mayor Rajoelina undertook an audit that identified and sought to address long-standing procedural irregularities and corruption in the city's administration. The CUA continues to be challenged by a shortage of revenues relative to its expenses caused by the high cost of retaining the large number of CUA personnel, weak structures for managing revenues from public rents and inadequate collection of tax revenues from city residents and businesses.|$|E
500|$|After gaining {{regional}} {{recognition for}} his sodina {{skills as a}} youth, Rakoto Frah rose to national fame in 1958 when he was selected by Malagasy President Philibert Tsiranana to perform on the sodina for the visiting French president Charles de Gaulle. This event launched {{his career as a}} professional musician. [...] He first played at traditional ceremonies around the country, then expanded his performances from 1967 to include participation in international music competitions and festivals. His popularity declined in the 1970s but underwent a revival that began in the mid-1980s and continued until his death in 2001. During this period Rakoto Frah recorded ten albums, toured extensively in Madagascar and overseas, was featured in two French documentaries, and collaborated with a variety of international and Malagasy artists. Over the course of his career he recorded over 800original compositions. Rakoto Frah and his sodina were depicted on the 200 <b>ariary</b> Malagasy banknote in honor of his key role in revitalizing and internationally popularizing the sodina. Despite the artist's worldwide acclaim, he lived simply and died having earned little from his lifetime of musicianship. His death was widely mourned and marked by a state funeral, and in 2011 a famadihana (the Malagasy highland [...] "turning of the bones" [...] funerary tradition) was organized to celebrate the artist's life.|$|E

2500|$|These {{exporters}} are {{supplied by}} a regional network of collectors and subcollectors, which procures {{the wood and}} transports it from the protected forests to the nearest major port, all through the paid labor of teams of young local men who receive between 5,000 and 10,000 <b>ariary,</b> or around US$2.50 to $5.00 per day. This income, which is sometimes not paid, is equivalent to less than 2% of the export value of the [...] logs they cut and transport. A report by the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and Global Witness estimated that 200 rosewood trees were being cut down a day in 2009. With prices at around $3000 per cubic meter or $11 per kilogram, the wood was worth nearly ten {{times as much as}} oak or maple.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of the illegally obtained rosewood was exported to several Chinese ports. [...] On October 31 alone, 55 containers holding 7,267 logs, weighing 989 tons and valued at $11 million, were shipped to China from Vohémar. [...] It has also been demonstrated that illegal logging is funded with advance payments from Chinese buyers; and that the local rosewood mafia collude with the foreign profiteers, primarily from China. [...] The EIA and Global Witness reported further that logging operations also received significant funds from a network of Chinese importers based in Antananarivo. [...] These importers are part of a recently established expatriate community of Chinese people in Madagascar. [...] Many hold passports due to a questionable practice started by the Prime Minister under former president Marc Ravalomanana, where Chinese immigrants could buy passports for 500,000 <b>ariary</b> or $2,500 per person. [...] According to an October issue of the Madagascar Tribune, these importers operate by selling Chinese household and electronic goods in Madagascar, using artificial customs declarations to under-report both their sales and their revenue, and then instead of repatriating the proceeds, they use the money to finance the tropical wood purchases of their compatriots in the SAVA Region.|$|E
