5|$|A gold dollar coin {{had been}} {{proposed}} {{several times in}} the 1830s and 1840s, but was not initially adopted.

In its early years, silver coins were being hoarded or exported, and the gold dollar found a ready place in commerce. Silver again circulated after Congress in 1853 required that new coins of that metal be made lighter, and the gold dollar became a rarity in commerce even before federal coins vanished from circulation because of the economic disruption caused by the American Civil War.|$|E

5|$|Anticipating {{that the}} Confederates would march on Gettysburg {{from the west}} {{on the morning of}} July 1, Buford laid out his {{defenses}} on three ridges west of the town: Herr Ridge, McPherson Ridge and Seminary Ridge.
