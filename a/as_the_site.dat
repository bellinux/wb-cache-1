5|$|According to USA Today, the match-up {{between the}} Longhorns and the Ohio State Buckeyes (OSU) {{was one of}} the most-anticipated games of the 2005season. Teams have become {{increasingly}} conservative in scheduling highly ranked non-conference opponents, so a meeting of the number 2 and number 4 teams in the country was unusual this early in the season. Because of the significance of the game in the national championship race, ESPN College GameDay chose the game <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> of its weekly broadcast. The American Football Coaches Association brought the national championship trophy to the game and displayed it on the field near Bevo, the UT mascot (photo below).|$|E

Despite the bid's lack of success, in the 1899 referendum Wagga Wagga residents voted strongly in favour of federation.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the city}} of Mahabalipuram was {{constructed}} by the Pallava king Narasimhavarman I in the 7th century AD, {{there is evidence that}} a small port might have functioned at the site even earlier. Megalithic burial urns dating to the very dawn of the Christian era have been discovered near Mahabalipuram. The Sangam age poem Perumpāṇāṟṟuppaṭai describes a port called Nirppeyyaru which some scholars identify with the present-day Mahabalipuram.

5|$|As {{a member}} of the House Appropriations Committee, Moran worked to {{allocate}} federal funding to projects in Northern Virginia, usually in the technology and defense industries.

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> of the Necropolis station {{had been}} {{intentionally}} chosen {{to abut the}} arches of the LSWR's viaduct, it acted {{as an obstacle to}} any {{increase in the number of}} lines serving Waterloo station. Urban growth in the area of what is now south west London, through which trains from Waterloo ran, led to congestion at the station, only slightly alleviated by the LSWR's 1877 takeover of the western LNC track. In the 1890s the situation became untenable, and the LSWR began to investigate the possibility of repositioning the LNC station to permit the expansion of the main line terminus.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the 1850s, St. Louis hosted annual {{agricultural}} and mechanical fairs at Fairground Park {{to connect with}} regional manufacturers and growers. By the 1880s, the connection to agriculture had declined, and in 1883, a new St. Louis Exposition and Music Hall was built to house industrial exhibits. In 1890, St. Louis attempted to host the World's Columbian Exposition, but the project was awarded to Chicago, which hosted the exposition in 1893. In 1899, delegates from states that {{had been part of}} the Louisiana Purchase met in St. Louis, selecting it <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> of a world's fair celebrating the centennial of the purchase in 1904.|$|E
5|$|Despite the opposition, on 30 June 1852 the London Necropolis & National Mausoleum Act 1852 was passed, {{giving the}} Brookwood scheme Parliamentary consent to proceed. The former Woking Common at Brookwood, {{owned by the}} Earl of Onslow, was chosen <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> for the new cemetery. To prevent the LSWR from {{exploiting}} its monopoly on access to the cemetery, the private Act of Parliament authorising the scheme bound the LSWR to carry corpses and mourners to the cemetery in perpetuity and set a maximum tariff which could be levied on funeral traffic, but did not specify details of how the funeral trains were to operate.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of the 18th century onwards, the garden went through major changes as it fell into neglect.
