It includes a brand-new 4K restoration and new bonus material.|$|E

5|$|Afterwards, Alexander {{travelled}} to Ecbatana {{to retrieve}} {{the bulk of the}} Persian treasure. There, his closest friend and possible lover, Hephaestion, died of illness or poisoning. Hephaestion's death devastated Alexander, and he ordered the preparation of <b>an</b> <b>expensive</b> funeral pyre in Babylon, as well as a decree for public mourning. Back in Babylon, Alexander planned a series of new campaigns, beginning with an invasion of Arabia, but he would not have a chance to realize them, as he died shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Although {{initially}} {{viewed as}} <b>an</b> <b>expensive</b> white elephant, within 10years {{the station was}} working at capacity (about 600 trains per day) and the GER was acquiring land {{to the east of}} the station for expansion. An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1888 and work started in 1890 on the eastward expansion of Liverpool Street by adding eight new tracks and platforms. This gave the station the most platforms of any London terminus until Victoria station was expanded in 1908.|$|E
5|$|Building a full spliced blank {{from scratch}} was <b>an</b> <b>expensive</b> and {{painstaking}} process, {{and the large}} manufacturing facilities of Brunswick turned out good quality blanks, with beautiful points, veneers and sound construction. In Balabushka's case, his entire workshop consisted of a single lathe and other woodworking equipment {{in the confines of}} his modest garage, and building his own full-splice butts would have been prohibitively difficult and expensive for him.|$|E

5|$|His {{successor}} at Ipswich was {{his assistant}} manager Bobby Ferguson. Under Ferguson, Town finished mid-table twice, but worsening performances {{meant that they}} began to struggle in the top division. The recent construction of <b>an</b> <b>expensive</b> new stand at Portman Road had limited the club's budget, despite the money gaining from sales of key players including Frans Thijssen and John Wark.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Lucky Luciano {{was photographed}} {{in front of}} the Hotel Sole in the centre of old Palermo – often the {{residence}} of Don Calò Vizzini – talking with Don Calò’s bodyguards. The photographer was beaten up, but he never reported the fact to the authorities after receiving <b>an</b> <b>expensive</b> new camera and cash.

In the summer of 637, the Muslims conquered Gaza, and, during the same period, the Byzantine authorities in Egypt and Mesopotamia purchased <b>an</b> <b>expensive</b> truce, which lasted three years for Egypt and one year for Mesopotamia. Antioch fell to the Muslim armies in late 637, and by then the Muslims occupied the whole of northern Syria, except for upper Mesopotamia, which they granted a one-year truce.|$|E

5|$|In some {{versions}} of the poem, considered older, Lalli's weapon was a sword. The axe was the murder weapon of Saint Olaf, who was very popular in Finland and may have influenced Henry's legend. However, since Lalli is not portrayed {{as a member of}} the upper class, it is unlikely that he possessed <b>an</b> <b>expensive</b> weapon like a sword, and the axe is a more historically likely choice for Henry's murder.|$|E

5|$|Sea silk is a {{fine fabric}} woven from the byssus threads of bivalves, {{particularly}} the pen shell (Pinna nobilis). It used to be produced in the Mediterranean region where these shells are endemic. It was <b>an</b> <b>expensive</b> fabric and overfishing has much reduced populations of the pen shell.

5|$|Among the Tlingit of the Pacific Northwest of America, {{earrings}} were {{a sign of}} nobility and wealth, as {{the placement}} of each earring on a child had to be purchased at <b>an</b> <b>expensive</b> potlatch. Earrings were common in the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt (1550–1292 BCE), generally taking {{the form of a}} dangling, gold hoop. Gem-studded, golden earrings shaped like asps seem to have been reserved for nobility. The ancient Greeks wore paste pendant earrings shaped like sacred birds or demigods, while the women of ancient Rome wore precious gemstones in their ears.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s Kneale {{was once again}} {{regularly}} writing for the BBC, who announced plans to produce a fourth Quatermass serial in 1972. This ultimately was not made by the BBC, but Kneale's scripts were produced in 1979 as a four-part serial for Thames Television, titled Quatermass. This time John Mills played Quatermass in <b>an</b> <b>expensive</b> and high-profile production, which was screened on the ITV network. The production company Euston Films also released a 100-minute film version titled The Quatermass Conclusion or Quatermass IV, for distribution abroad. There was, however, little interest among film distributors, and it received only a limited theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick {{was himself}} {{a critic of}} Big Science in general, and Lawrence in particular, whose {{approach}} he considered careless and focused on technology {{at the expense of}} science. When Lawrence postulated the existence of a new and hitherto unknown particle that he claimed was a possible source of limitless energy at the Solvay Conference in 1933, Chadwick responded that the results were more likely attributable to contamination of the equipment. While Lawrence rechecked his results at Berkeley only to find that Chadwick was correct, Rutherford and Oliphant conducted an investigation at the Cavendish that found that deuterium fuses to form helium-3, thereby causing the effect that the Lawrence had observed. This was another major discovery, but the Oliphant-Rutherford particle accelerator was <b>an</b> <b>expensive</b> state-of-the-art piece of equipment.|$|E
