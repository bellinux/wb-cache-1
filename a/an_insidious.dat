25|$|This anticlericalism was {{not left}} unanswered. The {{leader of the}} {{conservative}} Calvinists, Gisbertus Voetius, published {{the first volume of}} his Politica Ecclesiastica in 1663, in which he attacked (in Latin) De Witt and the Erastian policies of the regents. Possibly by Voetius also, but in any case by someone close to him, was the Resurrected Barnevelt, in which the anonymous writer, writing in Dutch, attacked the provincial-supremacy doctrine and the prayer formulary as <b>an</b> <b>insidious</b> attempt to make the other six provinces subservient to Holland. To which possibly De Witt himself replied with a scalding pamphlet, entitled Schotschen Duyvel in which he denounced Voetius by name as a master-mutineer.|$|E
25|$|In the Soviet 1982 miniseries Niccolo Paganini the {{musician}} is portrayed by the Armenian actor Vladimir Msryan. The series focuses on Paganini's {{relationship with the}} Roman Catholic Church. Another Soviet actor, Armen Dzhigarkhanyan, plays Paganini's fictionalized arch-rival, <b>an</b> <b>insidious</b> Jesuit official. The information in the series is generally spurious and it also plays {{to some of the}} myths and legends rampant during {{the musician}}'s lifetime. One memorable scene shows Paganini's adversaries sabotaging his violin before a high-profile performance, causing all strings but one to break during the concert. An undeterred Paganini continues to perform on three, two, and finally on a single string. In actuality, Paganini himself occasionally broke strings during his performances on purpose so he could further display his virtuosity. He did this by carefully filing notches into them to weaken them, so that they would break when in use.|$|E
500|$|Using the {{theories}} of Michel Foucault as their guide, Casey Finch and Peter Bowen in their 1990 essay [...] "'The Tittle-Tattle of Highbury': Gossip and the Free Indirect Style in Emma" [...] argued the free indirect discourse in Austen validates Fouucault's thesis that the Enlightenment was a fraud, <b>an</b> <b>insidious</b> form of oppression posing as liberation. Finch and Bowen argued that voice of the omnipresent narrator and together with the free indirect discourse summarizing the thoughts of characters in Emma were a form of [...] "surveillance" [...] that policed the thoughts of the character; seen in this light, Emma Woodhouse's discovery that she loves Mr. Knightley is not an expression of her real feelings, but rather society imposing its values on her mind by persuading {{her that she had}} to engage in a heterosexual marriage to produce sons to continue the Establishment and the while fooling her into thinking she was in love.|$|E

500|$|The Żydokomuna {{sentiment}} reappeared {{at times}} of severe political and socioeconomic crises in Stalinist Poland. After the death of Polish United Workers' Party leader Bolesław Bierut in 1956, a de-Stalinization and a subsequent battle among rival factions looked to lay blame for {{the excesses of the}} Stalin era. According to L.W. Gluchowski: [...] "Poland’s communists had grown accustomed to placing the burden of their own failures to gain sufficient legitimacy among the Polish population during the entire communist period on the shoulders of Jews in the party." [...] (See: above.) As described in one historical account, the party hardline Natolin faction [...] "used anti-Semitism as a political weapon and found an echo both in the party apparatus and in society at large, where traditional stereotypes of <b>an</b> <b>insidious</b> Jewish cobweb of political influence and economic gain resurfaced, but now in the context of 'Judeo-communism,' the Żydokomuna." [...] "Natolin" [...] leader Zenon Nowak entered the concept of [...] "Judeo-Stalinization" [...] and placed the blame for the party's failures, errors and repression on [...] "the Jewish apparatchiks." [...] Documents from this period chronicle antisemitic attitudes within Polish society, including beatings of Jews, loss of employment, and persecution. These outbursts of antisemitic sentiment from both Polish society and within the rank and file of the ruling party spurred the exodus of some 40,000 Polish Jews between 1956 and 1958.|$|E

2500|$|In 1981, 17-year-old Lisa Druck of Ocala, Florida (now {{known as}} Rielle Hunter) owned and rode a show horse named Henry the Hawk.

2500|$|The {{idea that}} the filles du roi were prostitutes has been <b>an</b> <b>insidious</b> rumour ever since the {{inception}} of the program in the 17th century. It seems to have arisen from a couple of misconceptions, both contemporary and modern, about immigration to French colonies in the New World. The first of these, which took root long before the first fille du roi emigrated, was that Canada was a penal colony. While there were two campaigns in the mid-16th century that involved the immigration of French criminals to Canada in exchange for their records being expunged, they were both short-lived. These programs resulted in little more than setting a precedent for viewing Canada as a place where those [...] "of questionable morality" [...] could be sent for one reason or another.|$|E

2500|$|<b>An</b> <b>insidious</b> and {{internal}} threat was embodied by servants, having {{long been a}} problem in eighteenth-century London. A significant number of domestic servants were accused and stood trial for different levels of theft. London was the principal destination for young people looking for work and fortune, {{and most of them}} were employed as servants or apprentices in houses and shops. Defoe presents a detailed inventory of the servants classes in The Behaviour of servants in England (1725), including not only shop-keepers, manufactures, cooks, and footmen, but even clerks to lawyers, attorneys, and gentlemen in public offices. Servants were, in Moreton's opinion, {{an integral part of the}} household they worked for, and they should behave as adopted children, being entirely loyal to their employers. On the other hand, their masters and mistresses should also assume their responsibility towards them and [...] "see that servants of both sexes go not a rambling when sent to church, but that they keep good hours; for many have been ruined by junketing and staying out, instead of being at church or at home".|$|E

2500|$|Today {{a growing}} body of {{scientific}} evidence indicate that this disease process, in the cancellous bone and bone marrow, is caused by bone infarcts mediated by a range of local and systemic factors. Bone infarcts as well as damage to the deeper portion of the cancellous bone is <b>an</b> <b>insidious</b> process. It is certainly not visible clinically and routine imaging techniques such as radiographs are not effective for that sort of damage. [...] "An important and often incompletely understood principle of radiography is the amount of bone destruction that goes undetected by routine x-rays procedures; this has been demonstrated by numerous investigators. Destruction confined to the cancellous portion of the bone cannot be detected radiographically, as radiolucencies appear only when there is internal or external erosion or destruction of the bone cortex." [...] In fact no radiographic findings are specific for bone infarction / osteonecrosis. A variety of pathologies may mimic bone infarction, including stress fractures, infections, inflammations, and metabolic and neoplastic processes. The limitations apply to all imaging modalities, including plain radiography, radionuclide studies, CT scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Through-transmission alveolar ultrasound, based on quantitative ultrasound (QUS) in combination with panoramic dental radiography (orthopantomography) is helpful in assessing changes in jawbone density. When practitioners have an up-to-date understanding of the disease process and a good anamnesis is combined with detailed clinical findings and course of events, the diagnosis, with the help of various imaging modality, can be achieved earlier, in most patients.|$|E
