High levels of homocysteine {{are linked to}} cardiovascular disease and <b>artherosclerosis,</b> particularly coronary artery disease. [...] PEMT deficiency prevents <b>artherosclerosis</b> in mice fed high-fat, high-cholesterol diets. [...] This is largely a result of lower levels of VLDL lipids in the PEMT-deficient mice.

5000|$|The {{low levels}} of A1 in humans are one reason why high lipid intake is {{damaging}} to health. ApoB48 {{is essential for the}} assembly and secretion of triglyceride-rich chylomicrons, which are necessary as a response to high-fat intake. ApoB100 are metabolized in the bloodstream to LDL cholesterol, high levels of which are associated with <b>artherosclerosis.</b> [...] While A1 has a negligible impact on human lipid synthesis, at high concentrations it can be genotoxic. Its diffusion toward the nucleic membrane can lead it to mutate DNA sequences that are actively transcribed on the genome. In single growth assays, A1 has been found to impact HIV replications. Additionally, A1 has reduced Hepatitus B virus (HBV) DNA replication, although the mechanism is still not known. The antiviral properties of A1 extend to both DNA and RNA due to its deamination function, which can hinder DNA replication and consequently suppress further infection by HIV or HBV. [...] There has also been evidence that A1 also edits at NF1, related to tumors in nerve cells.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of seven highly prevalent somatic chronic diseases {{on changes in}} cognitive functioning is investigated in older persons in a prospective design covering a 6 -year follow-up period. The data were collected {{as part of the}} Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA). The associations between chronic diseases and cognitive functioning during 6 years of follow-up were analyzed among 1358 respondents (age 62 - 85) using generalized estimated equations (GEE). Cognitive tests were used to assess: general cognitive functioning, fluid intelligence, information processing speed and memory performance. In the fully adjusted models diabetes mellitus, stroke and peripheral <b>artherosclerosis</b> were associated with cognitive decline during a 6 -year follow-up period in older persons. In the unadjusted models cardiac disease was negatively associated with memory function. However, after the correction for possible confounders this association became positive. Cancer was also associated with better memory function. A faster decline in especially memory function was found for diabetes mellitus, stroke, cancer, and peripheral <b>artherosclerosis.</b> The study shows that in older persons specific chronic diseases (diabetes mellitus, stroke, cancer, and peripheral <b>artherosclerosis)</b> are associated with decline in one or more domains of cognitive functioning during a 6 -year follow-up period.

40|$|Information {{about local}} {{diameter}} variations {{as a response}} to the pulse flow in the human coronary arteries may indicate the development of <b>artherosclerosis</b> before this can be seen as a stenosis on coronary angiograms. This paper describes the design of an image processing tool to measure this diameter variation from a sequence of digital coronary angiograms. If a blood vessel reponds less elastically to the pulse flow, this may be an indication of <b>artherosclerosis</b> in an early stage. We have developed an image analysis and processing algorithm which is able after vessel segment selection by the user, to calculate automatically the vessel diameter variations from a standard sequence of digital angiograms. Several problems are treated. The periodic motion of the vessel segment in the consecutive frames is taken into account by tracking the vessel segment using a 2 -dimensional logarithmic search to find the minimum in the mean absolute distance.

30|$|The {{distribution}} of lipids {{in the body}} is a good indicator of health status. Dyslipidemia which refers to a distortion in plasma lipid pattern is often characterized by a profound drop in HDL-cholesterol levels and a concomitant rise in LDL-cholesterol levels and signals severe problems with lipid metabolism. Such distortions in plasma lipid patterns could be predictive of <b>artherosclerosis</b> and associated cardiovascular complications [24]. In this study, the plant extract was able to dampen the dangerous trends in the levels of HDL-and LDL-cholesterol caused by carbon tetrachloride.

40|$|Background The {{major cause}} of {{morbidity}} and mortality in patients with type I diabetes mellitus is premature and extensive <b>artherosclerosis.</b> Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) is associated with cardivascular risk factors and {{has been used as a}} marker of early <b>artherosclerosis</b> process. Objective To determine IMT of carotid artery and its relationship with duration of diabetes, lipid profiles, and mean HbA 1 level. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on patients with type 1 DM at the Department of Child Health Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. Ultrasound B-mode imaging was performed to measure the IMT. Age-matched non-diabtetic subjects served as controls. Statistical significant was assumed at P<O. S. Results The mean IMT values of type I DM patients aged < 12 years, 12 - 18 years, 18 + years were 0. 44 (SD 0. 03) mm; 0. 46 (SD 0. 01) mm; 0. 51 (SD 0. 01) mm, respectively, which were significantly greater than those of age-matched non-diabetic subjects which were 0. 39 (SD 0. 01), 0. 41 (SD 0. 01) mm, 0. 46 (SD 0. 01) mm, respectively. Patients with type I DM had a higher apolipoprotein-Band HDL cholesterol levels than in non- diabetic subjects. Multiple regression analysis showed that there was no relationship between total cholesterol, cholesterol LDL, chronic hyperglycemia (HbA 1) and IMT. However, IMT in type I diabetes was linearly related with duration of diabetes. Conclusion Type I DM patients have greater IMT and higher mean apolipoprotein B.

40|$|Metabolic {{syndrome}} {{is defined as}} a set of health risk factors that are associated with an increased chance of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. These include abdominal obesity, hyperglycemia, impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Interventions in metabolic syndrome include lifestyle interventions such as a healthy diet using functional foods together with increased physical activity to induce weight loss as the first aim of treatment. Nutraceuticals such as tocotrienols and tocopherols as members of the vitamin E family may be more targeted interventions. This review evaluates the effects of tocotrienols on the risk factors of metabolic syndrome using data from human, animal and in vitro studies. Tocotrienols improved lipid profiles and reduced atherosclerotic lesions, decreased blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin concentrations, normalized blood pressure, and inhibited adipogenesis.

The simplest blood flow models only consider steady flow. However within the circulatory system, the periodic nature of the cardiac cycle induces a pulsatile, unsteady flow. This periodic pressure perturbation is expected to have significant implications for localised flow velocities and stress distributions. We propose here a pulsatile flow model using a grid-free method, Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. This method is well suited to transient flows within geometries of complex shape. The arterial geometry used here is a real carotid bifurcation derived from MRI. Rigid walls and Newtonian flow are assumed. In this paper we compare pulsatile and steady flow for this geometry...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Adiponectin {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{bioactive}} substances secreted by adipose tissue and is involved in the protection against metabolic syndrome, <b>artherosclerosis</b> and type II diabetes. Research into the use of adiponectin as a promising drug for metabolic syndromes requires production of this hormone in high quantities considering its molecular isoforms. The objective of this study is to produce recombinant human adiponectin by Pichia pastoris (P-ADP) as a cheap and convenient eukaryotic expression system for potential application in pharmaceutical therapy. For comparison, adiponectin was also expressed using the Escherichia coli (E-ADP) expression system. Adiponectin was constructed by overlap-extension PCR, and cloned in standard cloning vector and hosts. Recombinant expression vectors were cloned in the P. pastoris and E. coli host strains, respectively. SDS-PAGE and western blotting were used to detect and analyse expressed recombinant protein in both systems. Adiponectin was purified by affinity chromatography and quantified using the Bradford Assay. The results of this study indicated that P-ADP quantity (0. 111 mg/mL) was higher than that of E-ADP (0. 04 mg/mL) and both were produced in soluble form.

40|$|Within {{a day of}} gastrulation, the {{embryonic}} heart {{begins to}} beat and creates blood flow in the developing cardiovascular system. The onset of blood flow completely changes {{the environment in which}} the cardiovascular system is forming. Flow provides physiological feedback such that the developing network adapts to cue provided by the flow. Targeted inactivation of genes that alter early blood fluid dynamics induce secondary defects in the heart and vasculature and therefore proper blood flow is known to be essential for vascular development. Though hemodynamics, or blood fluid dynamics, are known to activate signaling pathways in the mature cardiovascular system in pathologies ranging from <b>artherosclerosis</b> to angiogenesis, the role in development has not been as intensively studied. The question arises how blood vessels in the embryos, which initially lack cells types such as smooth muscle cells, differ in their response to mechanical signals from blood flow as compared to the more mature cardiovascular system. Many genes known to be regulated by hemodynamics in the adult are important for developmental angiogenesis. Therefore the onset of blood flow is of primary importance to vascular development.

The data from the Regression Growth Evaluation Statin Study (REGRESS) are used to validate the model. Lipid lowering treatment of pravastatin resulted in less growth. of existing lesions and fewer new lesions than when placebo was given. Fewer new lesions were found in segments influenced by {{percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty}} (PTCA) than in segments not influenced by PTCA. Similarly, the growth of lesions influenced by PTCA was smaller than lesions not influenced by PTCA. More new occlusions were found in segments influenced by coronary arterial bypass grafting (CABG) than in segments not influenced by CABG, but 98 per cent of the new occlusions were located proximal to the bypass anastomosis. Similarly, existing lesions proximal to the bypass anastomosis showed larger growth (p < 0. 001).

40|$|Prenatal {{events such}} as intrauterine growth {{restriction}} {{have been shown to}} be associated with an increased thickness of abdominal aorta in the fetus. Therefore the measurement of abdominal aortic intima-media thickness (aIMT) has been recently considered a sensitive marker of <b>artherosclerosis</b> risk. To date measure of aortic diameter and of aIMT has been performed manually on US fetal images, thus being susceptible to intra- and inter- operator variability. This work introduces an automatic algorithm that identifies abdominal aorta and estimates its diameter and aIMT from videos recorded during routine third trimester ultrasonographic fetal biometry. Firstly, in each frame, the algorithm locates and segments the region corresponding to aorta by means of an active contour driven by two different external forces: a static vector field convolution force and a dynamic pressure force. Then, in each frame, the mean diameter of the vessel is computed, to reconstruct the cardiac cycle: in fact, we expect the diameter to have a sinusoidal trend, according to the heart rate. From the obtained sinusoid, we identify the frames corresponding to the end diastole and to the end systole. Finally, in these frames we assess the aIMT. According to its definition, we consider as aIMT the distance between the leading edge of the blood-intima interface, and the leading edge of the media-adventitia interface on the far wall of the vessel. The correlation between end-diastole and end-systole aIMT automatic and manual measures is 0. 90 and 0. 84 respectively...|$|E

The objective of this study is to produce recombinant human adiponectin by Pichia pastoris (P-ADP) as a cheap and convenient eukaryotic expression system for potential application in pharmaceutical therapy. For comparison, adiponectin was also expressed using the Escherichia coli (E-ADP) expression system. Adiponectin was constructed by overlap-extension PCR, and cloned in standard cloning vector and hosts. Recombinant expression vectors were cloned in the P. pastoris and E. coli host strains, respectively. SDS-PAGE and western blotting were used to detect and analyse expressed recombinant protein in both systems. Adiponectin was purified by affinity chromatography and quantified using the Bradford Assay. The results of this study indicated that P-ADP quantity (0. 111 mg/mL) was higher than that of E-ADP (0. 04 mg/mL) and both were produced in soluble form. However, P-ADP was able to form high molecular weights of adiponectin molecules, whilst E-ADP was not able to form isoforms higher than trimer. In addition, P-ADP was more active in lowering blood glucose compared with E-ADP. The two types of proteins were equally efficient and significantly decreased blood triglyceride and increased high density lipoprotein. We conclude that P. pastoris is able to produce high quantity of bioactive adiponectin for potential use in treatment of metabolic syndromes...|$|E
