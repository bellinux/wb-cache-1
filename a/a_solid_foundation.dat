5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} of Category 3 {{and higher}} {{are described as}} major hurricanes in the Atlantic or Eastern Pacific basins. These storms can cause some structural damage to small residences and utility buildings, particularly those of wood frame or manufactured materials with minor curtain wall failures. Buildings that lack <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> <b>foundation,</b> such as mobile homes, are usually destroyed, and gable-end roofs are peeled off. Manufactured homes usually sustain severe and irreparable damage. Flooding near the coast destroys smaller structures, while larger structures are struck by floating debris. A large number of trees are uprooted or snapped, isolating many areas. Additionally, terrain may be flooded well inland. Near-total to total power loss is likely for up to several weeks and water will likely also be lost or contaminated.|$|E
5|$|The Lingbao School {{began in}} around 400 CE when the Lingbao scriptures were {{revealed}} to Ge Chaofu, the grandnephew of Ge Hong. Ge Chaofu {{claimed that the}} scriptures came {{to him in a}} line of transmission going back to Ge Hong's great-uncle, Ge Xuan (164-244). Ge Chaofu transmitted the scriptures to two of his disciples, and the scriptures quickly gained immense popularity. In 471, Lu Xiujing (406-477) compiled a catalogue of all the Lingbao texts, and also was responsible for reorganizing and standardizing Lingbao ritual. This organization of texts and ritual provided <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> <b>foundation</b> on which the Lingbao School prospered in the subsequent centuries. During the Tang Dynasty, the influence of the Lingbao School declined and another school of Daoism, the Shangqing School, became prominent. Borrowing many Lingbao practices, it was well accepted by the aristocracy and established an influence in court.|$|E

25|$|A {{theory is}} called {{categorical}} {{if it has}} only one model, up to isomorphism. This term was introduced by , and for some time thereafter mathematicians hoped they could put mathematics on <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> <b>foundation</b> by describing a categorical first-order theory of some version of set theory. The Löwenheim–Skolem theorem dealt a first blow to this hope, as it implies that a first-order theory which has an infinite model cannot be categorical. Later, in 1931, the hope was shattered completely by Gödel's incompleteness theorem.|$|E

This type of area did not provide <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> <b>foundation</b> {{on which to build}} an entire town.

25|$|A common way to {{construct}} steel truss and prestressed concrete cantilever spans is to counterbalance each cantilever arm with another cantilever arm projecting the opposite direction, forming a balanced cantilever; when they attach to <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> <b>foundation,</b> the counterbalancing arms are called anchor arms. Thus, in a bridge built on two foundation piers, {{there are four}} cantilever arms: two which span the obstacle, and two anchor arms which extend away from the obstacle. Because {{of the need for}} more strength at the balanced cantilever's supports, the bridge superstructure often takes the form of towers above the foundation piers. The Commodore Barry Bridge is an example of this type of cantilever bridge.|$|E

25|$|Murray made {{important}} {{improvements to}} the machinery for heckling and spinning flax. Heckling was the preparation of flax for spinning by splitting and straightening the flax fibres. Murray's heckling machine gained him the gold medal of the Royal Society of Arts in 1809. At the time when these inventions were made the flax trade was {{on the point of}} expiring, the spinners being unable to produce yarn to a profit. The effect of his inventions was to reduce the cost of production, and improve the quality of the manufacture, thus establishing the British linen trade on <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> <b>foundation.</b> The production of flax-machinery became an important branch of manufacture at Leeds, large quantities being made for use at home as well as for exportation, giving employment to an increasing number of highly skilled mechanics.|$|E
