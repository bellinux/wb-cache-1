In Malawi, HIV/AIDS is usually transmitted through heterosexual sex, but the epidemic has also significantly impacted the homosexual male population in Malawi. In addition, women in Malawi {{are more likely to}} be HIV-positive than men, suggesting that women are particularly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. Finally, the disease has affected children and young adults both directly and indirectly; 170,000 Malawian children were HIV-positive in 2011, and the number of orphans in Malawi has increased dramatically since the epidemic began in 1985.|$|E

50|$|Three {{types of}} Toxics in Biota studies are {{performed}} by WDFW, usually in sequential order. Baseline Assessment Studies examine temporal tends in contaminants. Focus studies are performed in regions where Baseline Studies indicate contamination. Focus Studies provide specific spatial distributions of contaminants in Puget Sound regions {{and their effects}} on biota. Pilot Studies are {{used to test the}} assumptions of the two former studies. For example, a Baseline Study indicating high concentrations of PCBs in rockfish may lead to a Focus Study determining that endocrine systems of rockfish in that region may be disrupted by PAHs at these concentrations. Pilot Studies would then examine the extent to which factors like <b>age</b> <b>influence</b> disruption of rockfish endocrine systems. Pilot Studies are only necessary if there is no literature available to address the assumptions of Baseline and Focus Studies.|$|E
