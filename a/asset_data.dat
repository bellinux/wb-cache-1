40|$|Accurate {{and valid}} data is {{essential}} {{during the development}} of building projects and throughout the use phase of buildings. This study proposes a framework to help owners and facility managers in: (a) defining the requirements for asset management tasks in a structured way; (b) validating project and <b>asset</b> <b>data</b> against the established requirements; and (c) visualising <b>asset</b> <b>data,</b> stored in different and distributed sources, in an integrated and interactive way to support specific asset/facility management functions (e. g. maintenance tasks). The framework combines the use of Information Delivery Manual (IDM), Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), Construction Operations Building Information Exchange (COBie), and Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) {{in the development of}} Asset Information Models (AIM) to fulfil the owner’s requirements (Asset Information Requirements) throughout the lifecycle of a building. An AIM is a data model that contains all digital data (graphical, non-graphical, and documentary) required to operate an asset or portfolio of assets. Validation methods are identified for each of the AIM data types and a method for their integration and visualisation is proposed and implemented in a virtual environment. The proposed framework was tested in two use cases that involved (1) the validation of the various data sources against the client requirements, defined in the Asset Information Requirement (AIR); and (2) the visualisation of <b>asset</b> <b>data</b> required for a maintenance task in an interactive virtual environment. The two use cases demonstrated the capability of the framework to enable the definition of AIR and the validation of the different AIM’s data deliverables. The visualisation of the AIM data - from different and distributed sources - for a maintenance task was successfully performed in an integrated and interactive game environment. Future work will consider other data sources and will evaluate the proposed framework using real industrial data...|$|E
40|$|Australia’s civil {{infrastructure}} {{assets of}} roads, bridges, railways, buildings and other structures are worth billions of dollars. Road assets alone are valued at around A 140 billion. As {{the condition of}} assets deteriorate over time, close to A 10 billion is spent annually in asset maintenance on Australia's roads, or the equivalent of A 27 million per day. To effectively manage road infrastructures, firstly, road agencies need to optimise the expenditure for <b>asset</b> <b>data</b> collection, {{but at the same}} time, not jeopardise the reliability in using the optimised data to predict maintenance and rehabilitation costs. Secondly, road agencies need to accurately predict the deterioration rates of infrastructures to reflect local conditions so that the budget estimates could be accurately estimated. And finally, the prediction of budgets for maintenance and rehabilitation must provide a certain degree of reliability. A procedure for assessing investment decision for road asset management has been developed. The procedure includes: • A methodology for optimising <b>asset</b> <b>data</b> collection; • A methodology for calibrating deterioration prediction models; • A methodology for assessing risk-adjusted estimates for life-cycle cost estimates. • A decision framework in the form of risk ma...|$|E
