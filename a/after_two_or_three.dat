5|$|The C5 {{is powered}} by a 12-volt {{lead-acid}} electric battery driving a motor with a continuous rating of 250 watts and a maximum speed of 4,100 revolutions per minute. It is coupled with a two-stage gear-drive that increases torque by a factor of 13, without which the motor {{would not be able to}} move the vehicle when a person is on board. However, the motor is vulnerable to overheating. The torque increases as the load on the vehicle increases, for instance by going up too steep a gradient. Sinclair's tests showed that it could cope under power with a maximum slope of 1 in 12 (8%) and could manage a 1 in 7 (14%) slope using the pedals. As the speed of the motor reduces, the current flow through its windings increases, drawing up to 140 amps at stall speed. This would very quickly burn the motor out if sustained, so the motor's load is constantly monitored by the C5's electronics. If it stalls under full load the electronics disable the motor after 4 seconds, while if it is under heavy load (around 80 or 90 amps) it trips <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> minutes. A heat-sensitive resistor inside the motor warns the driver if the vehicle is beginning to overheat and disconnects the motor after a short time, and a third line of defence is provided by a metallic strip mounted on the motor. If an excessive temperature is reached the strip distorts and the power is disconnected.|$|E

On the next day, Encolpius wakes to find his lover and Ascyltos in bed together naked. Encolpius quarrels with Ascyltos and the two agree to part, but Encolpius is shocked when Giton decides to stay with Ascyltos (80). <b>After</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> days spent in separate lodgings sulking and brooding on his revenge, Encolpius sets out with sword in hand, but is disarmed by a soldier he encounters in the street (81–82).|$|E

25|$|Double-tailed web spiders mate during summer. After mating, {{the female}} will lay her eggs in an egg sac (an ovoid ball of spider silk) in her sanctuary. She then {{stretches}} her body {{over the surface}} of the egg sac and guards it. This behavior is distinctive and makes the species easy to recognise. The mother does not feed nor leave the sanctuary until the eggs have hatched, which is usually <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> weeks. Only then will she return {{to the center of the}} web and resume her normal activities. The spiderlings will remain in her sanctuary for a few more weeks before setting out on their own.|$|E
25|$|Although some sugarcanes produce seeds, modern stem cutting {{has become}} the most common {{reproduction}} method. Each cutting must contain at least one bud, and the cuttings are sometimes hand-planted. In more technologically advanced countries like the United States and Australia, billet planting is common. Billets harvested from a mechanical harvester are planted by a machine that opens and recloses the ground. Once planted, a stand can be harvested several times; after each harvest, the cane sends up new stalks, called ratoons. Successive harvests give decreasing yields, eventually justifying replanting. Two to 10 harvests are usually made {{depending on the type of}} culture. In a country with a mechanical agriculture looking for a high production of large fields, like in North America, sugar canes are replanted <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> harvests to avoid a lowering in yields. In countries with a more traditional type of agriculture with smaller fields and hand harvesting, like in the French island la Réunion, sugar canes are often harvested up to 10 years before replanting.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{perception}} {{of being able to}} perform effortlessly, acquaintances of Tracy said that he would carefully prepare for each role. Joseph L. Mankiewicz lived with Tracy during the production of Test Pilot, and recounted that the actor would lock himself in his bedroom [...] "working extremely hard" [...] each night. Many co-workers commented on his strong work-ethic and professionalism. Tracy did not like to rehearse, however, and would lose his effectiveness <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> takes. Kanin described him as [...] "an instinctive player, who trusted the moment of creation."

500|$|Some leading partisans of {{the former}} Shogun were imprisoned, but {{narrowly}} escaped execution. This clemency derives from the insistence of Saigō Takamori and Iwakura Tomomi, although much weight {{was placed on the}} advice of Parkes, the British envoy.

[...] <b>After</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> years of imprisonment, most of them were called to serve the new government, and several pursued brilliant careers.

500|$|More {{than half}} of people with {{advanced}} cancer and pain will need strong opioids, and these in combination with non-opioid pain medicine can produce acceptable analgesia in 70–90 percent of cases. A Cochrane review updated in 2016 concluded that morphine is effective in relieving cancer pain. Side effects of nausea and constipation are rarely severe enough to warrant stopping of treatment. [...] Sedation and cognitive impairment usually occur with the initial dose or {{a significant increase in}} dosage of a strong opioid, but improve after a week or two of consistent dosage. Antiemetic and laxative treatment should be commenced concurrently with strong opioids, to counteract the usual nausea and constipation. Nausea normally resolves <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> weeks of treatment but laxatives will need to be aggressively maintained.|$|E

500|$|Banksia ilicifolia has a stout trunk up to [...] in diameter, and rough, fibrous, grey bark {{which is}} up to [...] thick. New growth takes place mainly in summer. Young branchlets are covered in hair which they lose <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> years.

The leaves sit atop petioles [...] in length. The upper and undersurface of the leaves are initially covered in fine hairs but become smooth with maturity. Flowering takes place from late winter to early summer. The inflorescences are dome-shaped flower heads rather than spikes as many other banksias, and arise from stems that are around a year old. No lateral branchlets grow outwards from the node where the flower head arises. The flower heads measure [...] in diameter, and bear 60 to 100 individual flowers. The inflorescences pass through three colour phases, being initially yellow, then pink, then finally red, before falling away from the head. One to three follicles develop from fertilised flowers, and remain embedded in the woody base of the flower head. Each follicle bears one or two seeds.|$|E
