The empirical results show {{that a number of}} these characteristics do affect rent. Specifically, such items as covered parking and modern kitchen are important determinants of rent.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the socially optimal forest taxation {{in the rotation}} framework when {{the government has a}} binding tax revenue requirement. In the Faustmann model the optimal design of taxation consists of non-distortionary taxes, such as site productivity tax, site value tax or profit tax. A combination of distortionary unit (or yield) tax and timber tax {{can also be used to}} collect the tax revenue in a nondistortionary way. In the Hartman model with forest <b>amenity</b> <b>services</b> as a public good, the optimal design consists of a non-distortionary tax and a Pigouvian tax, which adjusts the private rotation age to the socially optimal one. Now only the site productivity tax is non-distortionary, while unit, yield, timber, site value and profit taxes generally serve as corrective Pigouvian taxes. Finally, in the absence of a non-distortionary tax, if the marginal valuation of <b>amenity</b> <b>services</b> is non-decreasing with the age of forest stand, a combination of unit (or yield) and timber taxes can be used to both tax revenue collection and Pigouvian correction...|$|R

40|$|The paper studies optimal forest {{taxation}} under {{uncertainty about}} future timber price when private forest owners value <b>amenity</b> <b>services</b> of forest stands and forest stands have public goods characteristics. It {{is assumed that}} preferences of forest owners can be described by a quasi-linear, intertemporal utility function which reflects risk aversion in terms of consumption and constant marginal utility in terms of <b>amenity</b> <b>services.</b> The comparative statics of current and future harvesting in terms of timber price risk, site productivity tax and yield tax are first developed. It is shown that, given the optimal site productivity tax, which is independent of the timber harvested and thus non-distortionary, it is desirable to introduce the yield tax at the margin; it both corrects externality due to the public goods characteristic of forest stands {{and serves as a}} social insurance device. The optimal yield tax is less than 100 % and depends on the social value of forest stands, timber price risk and properties of compensated timber supply. In the general case the 'inverse elasticity rule’ – according to which the optimal yield tax is negatively related {{to the size of the}} substitution effects – may not hold. Under certainty, the desirability of the yield tax, given the optimal site productivity tax, depends only on the existence of public goods characteristic and is thus a pure Pigouvian tax.
