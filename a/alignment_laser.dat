The detection limit of 4590 fluorophores/µm 2 is compared with 4. 49 fluorophores/µm 2 of a commercial photomultiplier-tube-based microarray scanner. The performance gap can be reduced by improving optical coupling, mechanical <b>alignment,</b> <b>laser</b> power supply noise, improved circuit noise {{and an increase in}} the conversion gain.

40|$|Optical systems {{consisting}} {{of a series of}} optical elements require alignment from the input end to the output end. The optical elements can be mirrors, lenses, sources, detectors, or other devices. Complex optical systems are often difficult to align from end-to-end because the alignment beam must be inserted at one end in order for the beam to traverse the entire optical path to the other end. The ends of the optical train may not be easily accessible to the alignment beam. Typically, when a series of optical elements is to be aligned, an <b>alignment</b> <b>laser</b> beam is inserted into the optical path with a pick-off mirror {{at one end of the}} series of elements. But it may be impossible to insert the beam at an end-point. It can be difficult to locate the pick-off mirror at the desired position because there is not enough space, there is no mounting surface, or the location is occupied by a source, detector, or other component. Alternatively, the laser beam might be inserted at an intermediate location (not at an end-point) and sent, first in one direction and then the other, to the opposite ends of the optical system for alignment. However, in this case, alignment must be performed in two directions and extra effort is required to co-align the two beams to make them parallel and coincident, i. e., to follow the same path as an end-to-end beam. An optical device has been developed that accepts a laser beam as input and produces two co-aligned, but counter-propagating beams. In contrast to a conventional <b>alignment</b> <b>laser</b> placed at one end of the optical path, this invention can be placed at a convenient position within the optical train and aligned to send its two beams simultaneously along precisely opposite paths that, taken together, trace out exactly the same path as the conventional <b>alignment</b> <b>laser.</b> This invention allows the user the freedom to choose locations within the optical train for placement of the alignment beam. It is also self-aligned by design and requires almost no adjustment...|$|E

40|$|During {{the course}} of {{experiments}} involving high explosives, (HE), <b>alignment</b> <b>lasers</b> are often employed where the laser beam impinges upon a metal encased HE sample or on the bare HE itself during manned operations.

This paper addresses these concerns by describing a methodology for determining safety margins for laser impingement on metal encased HE as well as one for bare HE.

40|$|Optical {{diagnostics}} {{are currently}} being designed to analyze high-energy density physics experiments at the National Ignition Facility (NIF). Two independent line-imaging Velocity Interferometer System for Any Reflector (VISAR) interferometers have been fielded to measure shock velocities, breakout times, and emission of targets having sizes of 1 – 5 mm. An 8 -inch-diameter, fused silica triplet lens collects light at f/ 3 inside the 30 -foot-diameter NIF vacuum chamber. VISAR recordings use a 659. 5 -nm probe laser. By adding a specially coated beam splitter to the interferometer table, light at wavelengths from 540 to 645 nm is spilt into a thermal-imaging diagnostic. Because fused silica lenses {{are used in the}} first triplet relay, the intermediate image planes for different wavelengths separate by considerable distances. A corrector lens on the interferometer table reunites these separated wavelength planes to provide a good image. Thermal imaging collects light at f/ 5 from a 2 -mm object placed at Target Chamber Center (TCC). Streak cameras perform VISAR and thermal-imaging recording. All optical lenses are on kinematic mounts so that pointing accuracy of the optical axis may be checked. Counter-propagating laser beams (orange and red) are used to align both diagnostics.

40|$|This {{alignment}} {{technique was}} developed while performing heterodyne velocimetry measurements at LLNL. There {{are a few}} minor items needed, such as a white card with aperture in center, visible <b>alignment</b> <b>laser,</b> IR back reflection meter, and a microscope to view the bridge surface. The work was performed on KCP flyers that were 6 and 8 mils wide. The probes used were Oz Optics manufactured with focal distances of 42 mm and 26 mm. Both probes provide a spot size of approximately 80 ?m at 1550 nm. The 42 mm probes were specified to provide an internal back reflection of - 35 to - 40 dB, and the probe back reflections were measured to be - 37 dB and - 33 dB. The 26 mm probes were specified as - 30 dB and both measured - 30. 5 dB. The probe is initially aligned normal to the flyer/bridge surface. This provides a very high return signal, up to - 2 dB, due to the bridge reflectivity. A white card {{with a hole in}} the center as an aperture can be used to check the reflected beam position relative to the probe and launch beam, and the <b>alignment</b> <b>laser</b> spot centered on the bridge, see Figure 1 and Figure 2. The IR back reflection meter is used to measure the dB return from the probe and surface, and a white card or similar object is inserted between the probe and surface to block surface reflection. It may take several iterations between the visible <b>alignment</b> <b>laser</b> and the IR back reflection meter to complete this alignment procedure. Once aligned normal to the surface, the probe should be tilted to position the visible alignment beam as shown in Figure 3, and the flyer should be translated in the X and Y axis to reposition the alignment beam onto the flyer as shown in Figure 4. This tilting of the probe minimizes the amount of light from the bridge reflection into the fiber within the probe while maintaining the alignment as near normal to the flyer surface as possible. When the back reflection is measured after the tilt adjustment, the level should be about - 3 dB to - 6 dB higher than the probes specified back reflection. This 3 to 6 dB increase in back reflection from the surface relative to the probes specified back reflection is the optimal level for acquiring data from the flyer. Data obtained with the LLNL system is shown in Figure 5...|$|E

40|$|A molecule’s {{chemical}} {{behavior is}} governed by its electronic and nuclear properties. Imaging the temporal evolution of the valence electrons and {{the positions of the}} atoms during a chemical reaction provides direct insight into fundamental chemical processes. State-selected, strongly aligned and oriented molecular ensembles serve as ideal samples to study ultrafast chemical dynamics in the molecular frame [1]. Such dynamics can be extracted, for instance, via molecular-frame photoelectron angular distributions (MFPADs) [2]. We have developed techniques to manipulate the motion of molecules in cold supersonic beams using strong inhomogeneous electric and laser fields [3]. The state-selected molecules are aligned or oriented by the combined effect of a dc electric field and moderately strong laser pulses with tunable duration between 50 fs and 500 ps. This allows for non-adiabatic as well as adiabatic alignment. We will present our work on the alignment and orientation of carbonyl sulphide (OCS) : We have created, for example, coherent superpositions of pendular states in the strong field of the <b>alignment</b> <b>laser</b> that resulted in pendular motion [4] or strong laser-field-free orientation of absolute-ground-state OCS [5]. Subsequently, we have applied the obtained knowledge to the control of complex molecules. Furthermore, MFPADs of indole and indole-water 1 clusters were used to topographically build up a 3 D MFPAD. These can be discussed using two different theoretical models, i. e., first, an approach based on the strong-field approximation and, second, employing time-dependent density functional theory.

All optical lenses are on kinematic mounts or sliding rails, enabling pointing accuracy of the optical axis to be checked. Counter-propagating laser beams (orange and red) align these diagnostics to a listing of tolerances. Movable aperture cards, placed before and after lens groups, show the spread of alignment spots created by the orange and red <b>alignment</b> <b>lasers.</b> Optical elements include 1 -in. to 15 -in. diameter mirrors, lenses with up to 10. 5 -in. diameters, beamsplitters, etalons, dove prisms, filters, and pellicles. Alignment of more than 75 optical elements must be verified before each target shot. Archived images from eight alignment cameras prove proper alignment before each shot...|$|R
