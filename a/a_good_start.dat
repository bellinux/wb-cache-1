5|$|Horsfield enjoyed <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>start</b> to 2005–06, {{signing a}} new two-year {{contract}} and scoring twice {{in each of}} Albion's first two home games, but these {{proved to be the}} last goals he would score for the club. He made a total of 20 appearances in league and cup during his final season at West Bromwich Albion.|$|E
5|$|New rider Juan José Haedo {{gave the}} team <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>start</b> by winning early minor races. The {{classics}} season {{was a success}} by having O'Grady win Paris–Roubaix.

5|$|After joining up {{with the}} team for batting {{practice}} in June 1923, Gehrig was sent by Yankees manager Miller Huggins to the Hartford Senators. After <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>start,</b> Gehrig went through a long slump and suffered depression which led him to consider quitting baseball. Upon hearing this, Krichell was sent to Hartford {{to speak with the}} star player. He discovered that Gehrig was drinking, boosted his confidence and gave him batting advice, including one of Ty Cobb's batting tricks. Gehrig started hitting again, and eventually joined the Yankees.|$|E
5|$|Although {{this was}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>start,</b> Hastings {{was not a}} {{particularly}} well-known barrister, and cases were few and far between. To get around the lack of funds Hastings accepted a pupil, {{and for the next}} year Hastings lived almost exclusively off the fees that the pupil paid him. To maintain the appearance of an active and busy chamber Hastings had his clerk borrow papers from other barristers and give them to the pupil to work on, claiming that they were cases of Hastings.|$|E
5|$|Another former Hibernian player, John Hughes, {{was soon}} {{appointed}} {{in place of}} Paatelainen. Hughes, who made high-profile signings such as Anthony Stokes and Liam Miller, led Hibs to <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>start</b> to the 2009–10 season. Hibs finished fourth and qualified for the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League. A poor start to the following season, including first round exits in Europe and the League Cup, led to Hughes leaving the club by mutual consent. Hughes was replaced by Colin Calderwood, who was himself sacked on 6 November 2011.|$|E

5|$|By 1979, Nea Salamina was {{established}} in the first division. Despite <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>start</b> to the 1978–79 season, the team was demoted in the decisive last game to the second division after a quarter-century in the first division. The team's hopes rested both on defeating Enosis Neon Paralimni FC and Evagoras Paphos not to beat AC Omonia or Olympiakos Nicosia FC to lose by Alki Larnaca F.C.. Nea Salamina won over Enosis Neon Paralimni FC (3–2), but none of the others happened as Evagoras won and Olympiakos tied with Alki.|$|E
5|$|Craig made <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>start</b> to {{the tour}} in two warm-up matches against Rhodesia, scoring a century in each match. Australia won the matches by an innings and ten wickets respectively. Craig led his men in five {{first-class}} matches before the Tests and Australia won all by convincing margins; three ended in innings victories {{and the others}} were won by nine and ten wickets. This included a match against a South African XI, in which Craig scored 88 as Australia amassed 8/519 declared before winning by an innings.|$|E
5|$|Despite City {{finishing}} {{outside the}} play-off places, they were again installed as favourites for promotion by bookmakers for the 2008–09 season. McCall released 13players from his squad and {{replaced them with}} a number of signings with experience in a higher division, as well as Michael Boulding, who was one of League Two's top goalscorers during the 2007–08 campaign. McCall's side made <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>start</b> to the season, and after winning five of their opening six league games, went top of the league – the first time City had led the table in seven years.|$|E

5|$|After Australia {{ended with}} 509 {{and took a}} 334-run lead, Tallon took two {{difficult}} catches to dismiss key batsmen {{at the start of}} England's second innings. Miller removed Cyril Washbrook for one from a top-edged hook shot to Tallon. Bill Edrich was then caught behind attempting a cut from the off spin of Johnson. He did not read the arm ball that went straight on and the ball took the outside edge, leaving England at 2/39. He thus helped Australia to seize the initiative by denying England <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>start,</b> but they recovered. Later, he caught Godfrey Evans for 50 from Johnson as England ended at 441. Australia reached their target of 98 with two wickets down, completing an eight-wicket victory. Tallon conceded five and 12 byes in the two innings respectively.|$|E
5|$|Bayern {{got off to}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>start</b> under Ancelotti, {{defeating}} Dortmund 2–0 in the 2016 DFL-Supercup. Despite being {{eliminated in}} the quarter-finals of the Champions League by Real Madrid and the semi-finals of the DFB-Pokal by Borussia Dortmund, they managed to clinch a fifth consecutive Bundesliga title with three matches remaining following a 6–0 away win over VfL Wolfsburg. Ancelotti was sacked by Bayern on 28 September 2017 and replaced by interim manager Willy Sagnol, following a 3–0 loss to PSG in the 2017–18 Champions League group stage and a slow start to the Bundesliga season that found them in third place.|$|E
5|$|Because California {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Virginia Tech's Mike Imoh fielded the ball at the goal line and returned it 40yards. Bryan Randall got off to <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>start,</b> completing two passes for 26yards, and Kevin Jones ran the ball another 16yards. After pushing inside the California red zone, however, the California defense stiffened and Tech was prevented from gaining another first down. Kicker Carter Warley attempted his third field goal of the game—this one a 28-yard kick—but as before, the kick was no good.|$|E

5|$|Benzema {{got off to}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>start</b> for the 2008–09 season, scoring {{twice in}} Lyon's opening league match against Toulouse. The {{following}} three weeks, he scored goals against Rhône-Alpes rivals Grenoble and Saint-Étienne and scored a goal against Nice, converting a penalty in the dying seconds. Lyon won all three matches. As {{a result of his}} early goals, Lyon club president Jean-Michel Aulas quelled the many transfer rumors surrounding Benzema by placing a €100million price tag on the striker. He was also nominated alongside Franck Ribéry to be featured on the French cover of the video game FIFA 09.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>start</b> (1–0 in a {{friendly}} match against Guatemala after 10 years of failure against this opponent), a draw conceded at Estadio Cuscatlán in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF), facing a modest Guyana national football team (2–2) earned him {{the wrath of the}} public. A victory in extremis (2–3) at Georgetown, Guyana (with a penalty stopped by goalkeeper Dagoberto Portillo in additional time) allowed El Salvador to stay in the race for qualification to the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. Unfortunately the home defeat (0–1) against Costa Rica buried the hopes of qualifying for the national team. Juan de Dios Castillo was removed from office in November 2012 and replaced on December 17 by the Peruvian Agustín Castillo, five national champion with C.D. FAS.|$|E
5|$|Miami {{got off to}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>start</b> {{doing just}} that as it raced out to four {{consecutive}} wins to begin the season, including a victory over nationally ranked rival No. 9 Florida State. On October 11, however, Miami traveled to South Bend, Indiana, to face the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and suffered its first loss of the season to the undefeated Irish, who {{would go on to}} be ranked No. 1 in the country. This defeat was followed in succession by two others, but the Hurricanes were able to stop the slide on November 8 with a homecoming win over East Carolina. Miami added two more wins {{before the end of the}} season, and brought the regular season to a close with an overall record of 83.|$|E

5|$|On March 25, 2010, Butler faced top-seeded Syracuse. The Bulldogs {{got off to}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>start,</b> {{jumping out}} to a 12–1 lead and a 35–25 halftime advantage. Syracuse rallied in the second half, taking its first lead of the game, 40–39, off a Wes Johnson three-pointer. Stevens called timeout and Butler regained the lead on its next possession, {{stopping}} the run. At the 5:32 mark, Syracuse got a rare fast break opportunity that ended with a dunk and 54–50 lead. Stevens again called time out and re-focused the team. Butler responded by holding Syracuse scoreless for the next 5 minutes, taking a 60–54 lead with 0:59 to go. Butler held on to win 63–59, advancing to the Elite Eight {{for the first time}} in school history.|$|E
5|$|Poor {{performances}} in the 1968/69 cup competitions meant Liverpool had less fixture congestion than the previous season. They {{finished second in the}} 1968–69 Football League six points behind Leeds United. Left back, Gerry Byrne, retired after 333appearances and 12 seasons. Shankly started replacing ageing players in his squad, purchasing future captain Emlyn Hughes and goalkeeper Ray Clemence the season before. Tony Hateley joined for a club record fee of £96,000 from Chelsea, but transferred after a year to Coventry City after injury and poor form. Mid-season Shankly signed Alun Evans from Wolverhampton Wanderers for a then record £100,000 fee for a teenager. After <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>start,</b> Evans' career was curtailed by injuries.|$|E

On lap 193, Hamlin had a growing lead over Kahne. Denny Hamlin crossed the line to win the race, a second ahead of second place Kasey Kahne. Kurt Busch maintained third while Jeff Gordon and Tony Stewart finished fourth and fifth.|$|E
