This Ku-band instrument was refurbished in 1990 by the Microwave Remote Sensing Laboratory at the University of Massachusetts to obtain high-resolution altitude measurements and to improve the tracking, speed, storage and display capabilities of the radar. In 1991 and 1993, the AAFE altimeter {{took part in the}} NASA Multisensor <b>Airborne</b> <b>Altimetry</b> Experiments over Greenland, along with two NASA laser altimeters. Altitude results from both experiments are presented along with comparisons to the laser altimeter and calibration passes over the Sondrestroem runway in Greenland. Although {{it is too early to}} make a conclusion about the growth or decay of the ice sheet, these results show that the instrument is capable of measuring small-scale surface changes to within 14 centimeters. In addition, results from these experiments reveal that the radar is sensitive to the different diagenetic regions of the ice sheet. Return waveforms from the wet- snow, percolation and dry-snow zones show varying effects of both surface scattering and sub-surface or volume scattering. Models of each of the diagenetic regions of Greenland are presented along with parameters such as rms surface roughness, rms surface slope and attenuation coefficient of the snow pack obtained by fitting the models to actual return waveforms...|$|E

40|$|<b>Airborne</b> laser <b>altimetry</b> has the {{potential}} to make frequent detailed observations that are important for many aspects of studying land surface processes. However, the uncertainties inherent in <b>airborne</b> laser <b>altimetry</b> data have rarely been well measured. Uncertainty is often specified as generally as 20 cm in elevation, and 40 cm planimetric. To better constrain these uncertainties, we present an analysis of several datasets acquired specifically to study the temporal consistency of laser altimetry data, and thus assess its operational value. The error budget has three main components, each with a time regime. For measurements acquired less than 50 ms apart, elevations have a local standard deviation in height of 3. 5 cm, enabling the local measurement of surface roughness of the order of 5 cm. Points acquired seconds apart acquire an additional random error due to Differential Geographic Positioning System (DGPS) fluctuation. Measurements made up to an hour apart show an elevation drift of 7 cm over a half hour. Over months, this drift gives rise to a random elevation offset between swathes, with an average of 6. 4 cm. The RMS planimetric error in point location was derived as 37. 4 cm. We conclude by considering the consequences of these uncertainties on the principle application of laser altimetry in the UK, intertidal zone monitoring...|$|R

It is the first published full coverage model, computed with an average resolution of 2 km and providing an unprecedented degree of detail. The topography is modeled from a wide selection of data sources, including satellite radar altimetry from Geosat and ERS 1, <b>airborne</b> radar <b>altimetry</b> and <b>airborne</b> laser <b>altimetry</b> over the ice sheet, and photogrammetric and manual map scannings in the ice free region. The ice sheet model accuracy is evaluated by omitting airborne laser data from the analysis and treating them as ground truth observations.

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1980 's, NASA has {{developed}} several small, all-solid state lasers of low repetition rates {{for use as}} transmitters in prototype LIDAR and raster scanned altimetry retrieval systems. Our early laser transmitters were developed for high resolution <b>airborne</b> <b>altimetry</b> which employed cavity dumping techniques to produce a pulse shape with a 1 ns rise time. The first such laser was the SUMR (Sub-millimeter resolution) transmitter which used a side pumped, D-shaped half-rod of Nd:YAG for the oscillator active media and produced approximately 3 ns pulses of 100 micro-J energy at a 40 Hz repetition rate. (Coyle and Blair, 1993; Coyle et al., 1995) After several upgrades to improve rep rate and pulse energy, the final version produced 1. 2 mJ pulses at 120 Hz with a 3. 7 ns pulse width. The laser {{has become known as}} SPLT (Sharp Pulsed Laser Transmitter), and has flown successfully on a variety of <b>airborne</b> <b>altimetry</b> missions. (Coyle and Blair, 1995; Blair et al., 1994) From building these systems, we have accrued valuable experience in delivering field-deployable lasers and have become aware of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} employing new technologies. For example, even though the laser's main operating environment is in a "cold" aircraft during flight, the laser must still operate in very warm temperatures. This is important if the mission is based in the desert or a tropical climate since ground calibration data from stationary targets must be gathered before and after each data flight. Because conductive cooling is much more convenient than closed loop water flow, achieving the highest possible laser efficiency is becoming a high priority when designing a flight laser. This is especially true for lasers with higher pulse energies and repetition rates which are needed for high altitude scanning altimeters and LIDARs...|$|E
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the surface topography of the ice sheets is an essential boundary condition for estimating mass balances with respect to sea level change and as well paleo climatic reconstruction. Nowadays satellites provide an easy accessible way to derive surface topography on a continental scale, but they lack either of horizontal resolution (radar satellite altimetry) or horizontal coverage (laser satellite altimetry). For regional surveys <b>airborne</b> <b>altimetry</b> and ground-based kinematic GPS measurements provide both, high horizontal resolution and coverage. We will present a new high resolution digital elevation model (DEM) for central Dronning Maud Land (DML), Antarctica, between 10 °W and 20 °E and {{in the south of}} the coastal mountains up to 80 °S, based on <b>airborne</b> <b>altimetry</b> (ARA) and ground-based GPS measurements As the interior of Dronning Maud Land (DML), Antarctica, is a gently inclined region, slope induced error of radar altimetry can be neglected in this flat region. The ground based kinematic GPS measurements were processed with nearby reference stations, precise ephemeris, ionosphere-free solution and the tropospheric model of Niell. The ARA data are a combination of kinematic GPS measurements and radar altimetry; the kinematic GPS data were processed like the ground based data. While determining the surface topography from the GPS and altimeter measurements, the aircraft attitude was taken into account. Because of the short baselines (maximum 26 km), the ground based data derived elevation data with an elevation accuracy of 0. 03 m. The along track distance of data point are 2. 8 m. To this end, ground based kinematic GPS measurements provide high resolution elevation information. Due to the long baselines (because of the scope of the aircraft) and the penetration of the radar signal into the snow surface, the ARA derived less accurate elevation information than the ground based kinematic GPS measurements. To check the penetration of the radar signal into the surface, we performed a cross-over point analysis between the ground data and ARA. By combining the two data sets, we achieve a high spatial resolution over the whole area of investigation, which eases the interpolation. The generated surface topography in the area of investigation builds a reference DEM for a combined accurate DEM of whole DML, which consists of several geophysical data sets...|$|E

A total of eight land cover types were identified first in the field, and then some 83 training points and another 74 reference points were chosen and recorded for a supervised classification and its accuracy assessment respectively. By applying a supervised procedure to Landsat TM data in two different seasons, these eight cover types, consisting of six vegetated covers, i. e. closed and open conifer forests, conifer woodland, closed and open broad-leaved forests and marsh thicket, and two non-vegetated covers, i. e. bare ground and water surface, were classified. The classific-ation was basically successful with an overall accuracy of 76 %.

In areas of high slope, cross-track errors result in measured elevation change that combines surface slope and the actual Δz/Δt signal. Slope corrections are particularly important in coastal ice streams, which often exhibit both rapidly changing elevations and high surface slopes.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} radar-altimeter scattering {{models for}} each of the diagenetic zones of the Greenland ice sheet. AAFE radar- altimeter waveforms obtained during the 1991 and 1993 NASA multi-sensor <b>airborne</b> <b>altimetry</b> experiments over Greenland reveal that the Ku-band return pulse changes significantly with the different diagenetic zones. These changes are due to varying amounts of surface and volume scattering in the return waveform. In the ablation and soaked zones, where surface scattering dominates the AAFE return, geophysical parameters such as rms surface height and rms surface slope are obtained by fitting the waveforms to a surface-scattering model. Waveforms from the percolation zone show that the sub-surface ice features have a much more significant effect on the return pulse than the surrounding snowpack. Model percolation waveforms, created using a combined surface- and volume-scattering model and an ice-feature distribution obtained during the 1993 field season, agree well with actual AAFE waveforms taken in the same time period. Using a combined surface- and volume-scattering model for the dry-snow-zone return waveforms, the rms surface height and slope and the attenuation coefficient of the snowpack are obtained. These scattering models not only allow geophysical parameters of the ice sheet to be measured but also help in the understanding of satellite radar-altimeter data...|$|E

Comparisons with complementary, ground-based CPS data at a site close to Bishop airport indicate that the laser and GPS-derived elevations agree to within the error inherent in the measurement and that horizontal locations agree to within the radius of the laser footprint.

A comprehensive study of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) drainage basin was carried out to improve understanding of the coastal freshwater discharge (FWD) and glacier volume loss (GVL). Hydrologic processes during the period 1980 – 2014 were modeled using a suite of physically based, spatially distributed weather, energy-balance snow/ice melt, soil water balance, and runoff routing models at a high-resolution (1 km horizontal grid; daily time step). Meteorological forcing was provided by the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA), and Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) data sets. Streamflow and glacier mass balance modeled using MERRA and CFSR compared well with observations in four watersheds used for calibration in the study domain. However, only CFSR produced regional seasonal and long-term trends in water balance that compared favorably with independent Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and <b>airborne</b> <b>altimetry</b> data. Mean annual runoff using CFSR was 760 km³ yr⁻¹, 8 % of which was derived from the long-term removal of stored water from glaciers (glacier volume loss).

Glacier runoff, taken as the sum of rainfall, snow, and ice melt occurring each season on glacier surfaces, was 38 % of the total seasonal runoff, with the remaining runoff sourced from nonglacier surfaces.

For this purpose, two <b>airborne</b> <b>altimetry</b> data sets and spaceborne laser altimetry data of the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) are used. The basic tool for the combination of these data sets is the crossover-point analysis. In this process, the elevation differences at equal positions (crossover points) of two different data sets are determined. On the basis of this process, the vertical accuracy of the different data sets and the elevation differences to the ground-based kinematic GPS data are determined. These differences are used to shift the remotely sensed data to the highly accurate ground-based GPS data. With the aid of the geostatistical interpolation method ”Ordinary Kriging” an improved digital elevation model with a resolution of 2. 5 km x 2. 5 km of the region within 20 °W to 20 °E and 69 ° S up to 86 °S was generated. A comparison with commonly used digital elevation models, covering the whole continent, shows high elevation differences up to several 100 m in the coastal region. Due to the use of ground-based highly accurate GPS data, the elevation model could be significantly improved above all for the coastal region of DML. An application of this elevation model is the re-locating of the ice divides in the area of investigation. Ice divides are the lines between two neighboring catchment areas. Their location is determined by the aspect of the topography. Additionally, static GPS measurements are processed to determine the surface flow velocity of the ice, which is further used for the calculation of the strain rate in the vicinity of Kohnen station. These results will improve the interpretation of climate proxies of the deep ice core (EDML), which was drilled between 2001 and 2006 at Kohnen station within the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA).

From crossover-point analyses mean annual elevation change was determined for the coastal region and the plateau. The mean annual elevation change trend shows decreasing elevations in the coastal region (0. 06 m) as well as at the plateau (- 0. 02 m).

We conclude that GEOID 94 A constitutes a reliable reference model for studies of Greenland's gravity field...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} and mass balance regime of the Austfonna ice cap, the largest glacier on Svalbard, deviate significantly from most other glaciers {{in the region}} and is not fully understood. We have compared ICESat laser <b>altimetry,</b> <b>airborne</b> laser <b>altimetry,</b> GNSS surface profiles and radio echo-sounding data to estimate elevation change rates for the periods 1983 – 2007 and 2002 – 2008. The data sets indicate a pronounced interior thickening of up to 0. 5 m y&minus; 1 , {{at the same time as}} the margins are thinning at a rate of 1 – 3 m y&minus; 1 . The southern basins are thickening at a higher rate than the northern basins due to a higher accumulation rate. The overall volume change in the 2002 – 2008 period is estimated to be &minus; 1. 3 &plusmn; 0. 5 km 3 w. e. y&minus; 1 (or &minus; 0. 16 &plusmn; 0. 06 m w. e. y&minus; 1 ) where the entire net loss is due to a rapid retreat of the calving fronts. Since most of the marine ice loss occurs below sea level, Austfonna's current contribution to sea level change is close to zero. The geodetic results are compared to in-situ mass balance measurements which indicate that the 2004 – 2008 surface net mass balance has been slightly positive (0. 05 m w. e. y&minus; 1 ) though with large annual variations. Similarities between local net mass balances and local elevation changes indicate that most of the ice cap is dormant and not in dynamic equilibrium with the current climate. More knowledge is needed about century-scale dynamic processes in order to predict the future evolution of Austfonna based on climate scenarios...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Digital {{elevation}} {{models of}} glaciated terrain pro-duced by the NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) air-borne interferometric synthetic-aperture radar (InSAR) in-strument in Greenland and Alaska at the C- (5. 6 cm wave-length) and L-band (24 -cm) frequencies {{were compared with}} surface elevation measured from <b>airborne</b> laser <b>altimetry</b> to estimate the phase center of the interferometric depth, or penetration depth, p. On cold polar rn at Greenland sum-mit, p = 92 m at C- and 144 m at L-band. On the ex-posed ice surface of Jakobshavn Isbrae, west Greenland, p = 12 m at C- and 33 m at L-band except on smooth, marginal ice where p = 155 m. On colder marginal ice of northeast Greenland, p reaches 60 to 120 m at L-band. On the temperate ice of Brady Glacier, Alaska, p is 42 m at C-and 126 m at L-band, with little dependence on snow/ice conditions. The implications of the results on the scientic use of InSAR data over snow/ice terrain is discussed. 1...|$|R
40|$|Flood extent maps {{derived from}} SAR images are a useful {{source of data}} for validating {{hydraulic}} models of river flood flow. The accuracy of such maps is reduced {{by a number of}} factors, including changes in returns from the water surface caused by different meteorological conditions and the presence of emergent vegetation. The paper describes how improved accuracy can be achieved by modifying an existing flood extent delineation algorithm to use <b>airborne</b> laser <b>altimetry</b> (LiDAR) as well as SAR data. The LiDAR data provide an additional constraint that waterline (land-water boundary) heights should vary smoothly along the flooded reach. The method was tested on a SAR image of a flood for which contemporaneous aerial photography existed, together with LiDAR data of the un-flooded reach. Waterline heights of the SAR flood extent conditioned on both SAR and LiDAR data matched the corresponding heights from the aerial photo waterline significantly more closely than those from the SAR flood extent conditioned only on SAR data...|$|R
40|$|The warming {{resulting}} from increasing anthropogenic {{carbon dioxide and}} other greenhouse gasses is expected to be most prominent in the subarctic-boreal region of the Northern Hemisphere. With the objective of setting up a baseline to monitor possible vegetation change in this region, a continuous vegetation profile extending 600 km from Edmonton, Alberta to Cluff Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada was measured using an airborne infrared laser altimeter mounted on a helicopter. Then the distribution of leaf area index over the same 600 km long transect was estimated from this vegetation profile based on a series of plot surveys on the ground to correlate the vegetation profile with leaf area index via standing stock. The distribution of leaf area index not only corresponded well with biome type, but also showed characteristic change in accordance with environmental gradient within a given biome, thus confirming that <b>airborne</b> laser <b>altimetry</b> is a powerful tool for measuring and monitoring such important vegetation characteristics as standing volume, leaf area index, etc. over an extensive area...|$|R
40|$|A 2 D {{hydraulic}} {{numerical model}} is presented. It {{is based on}} the fully dynamic shallow-water equations, solved by means of a finite volume scheme on multiblock structured grids. The model handles highly accurate DSM derived from <b>airborne</b> laser <b>altimetry</b> for the floodplains and sonar detection for the bathymetry of the main channel. The flow simulations are performed with a typical grid spacing of 2 m, comparable to the resolution of the DSM and fine enough to represent reliably the flows at the scale of each building. Consequently, the model succeeds in predicting accurately the pattern of flood depth even in densely urbanized floodplains, as confirmed by several validation examples, which also demonstrate the ability of the model to reproduce depth measurements {{for a wide range of}} flood discharges without the need for recalibration of the roughness coefficient. Finally, the hydraulic model is exploited as a component of a complete flood risk modelling chain, accounting for socio-economic and ecological impacts of floods and dedicated to the assessment of flood protection measures in the context of climate change.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{long history}} of {{research}} documents that McCall Glacier, Arctic Alaska, USA, continues to lose mass {{at a rate that}} is likely increasing with time. We present a photo comparison (1958 – 2003) that visually documents these volume changes, along with survey measurements that quantify these losses. Measurements of longitudinal profiles initially acquired from <b>airborne</b> laser <b>altimetry,</b> and repeated by ground-based surveys, indicate that the areally averaged rate of thinning increased between 1956 – 93 and 1993 – 2002, from 0. 350. 07 ma– 1 to 0. 470. 03 ma– 1, respectively; total volume loss was (8. 3107) (1. 7107) m 3 and (2. 7 107) (0. 2 107) m 3 (all in water equivalent) for these two time periods. These profiles also indicate that a 1 km stretch of the mid-ablation area is behaving differently from this trend, with a rate of thinning that is not changing with time. Lastly we present a comparison of several methods for calculating volume change and assess their relative errors...|$|R

40|$|Systematic {{errors in}} point clouds {{acquired}} by airborne laser scanners, photogrammetric methods or other 3 D measurement techniques {{need to be}} estimated and removed by adjustment procedures. The proposed method estimates the transformation parameters between reference surface and registration surface using a mathematical adjustment model. 3 D surface matching {{is an extension of}} 2 D least squares image matching. The estimation model is a typical Gauss-Markoff model and the goal is minimizing the sum of squares of the Euclidean distances between the contiguous surfaces. Besides the generic mathematical model, we also propose a concept of conjugate points rules which are suitable for special registering applications, and compare it to three typical conjugate points rules. Finally, we explain how this method can be used for the co-registration of real 3 D point sets and show co-registration results based on airborne laser scanner data. Concluding results of our experiment suggest that the proposed method has a good performance of 3 D surface matching, and the least normal distance rule returns the best result for the strip adjustment of <b>airborne</b> laser <b>altimetry</b> data...|$|R
