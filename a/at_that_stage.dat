This announcement was a disappointment to Great Southern, although only 30 per cent of its business <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>stage</b> was non-forestry MIS that {{would be affected by}} the ATO ruling. The ATO's ruling was overturned in 2008, however it had created significant investor and lender uncertainty.|$|E

5|$|Just {{under three}} months later, Wallhead faced off against Fabricio Nascimento. Wallhead kept the fight {{on their feet}} throughout, {{preventing}} Nascimento's takedowns. Frustrated by Wallhead's superior boxing, Nascimento visibly showed his disdain. Wallhead took the unanimous decision victory which was regarded {{as the most important}} victory he had claimed <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>stage</b> in his career.|$|E

5|$|In early November, {{after it}} had started concentration, the battalion– {{consisting}} <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>stage</b> of just a small cadre force of officers and non-commissioned officers drawn mainly from several Militia units including the 14th, the 23rd/21st, the 29th, and the 46th Battalions– was moved to Puckapunyal, Victoria. While there, it received a number of drafts of recruits and was brought up to strength. With an authorised strength of around 900 personnel, like other Australian infantry battalions of the time, the battalion was formed around a nucleus of four rifle companies– designated 'A' through to 'D'– each consisting of three platoons.|$|E
5|$|It was Geoffrey Barrow's belief, {{supported}} by Donald Watt, that their decision {{was the result}} of pressure from the new Scottish king, Robert de Brus, who may have valued Balmyle's experience and trusted his political record.

5|$|There were 31 {{compensatory}} selections {{distributed among}} 16 teams during rounds three through seven, with the Jacksonville Jaguars and Buffalo Bills receiving 4 picks each. The University of Miami was the college {{with the most}} players selected in the first round, with Dan Morgan, Damione Lewis, Santana Moss and Reggie Wayne all picked <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>stage.</b> Across the whole draft, however, Florida State University had the most players selected, a total of nine compared to Miami's seven.|$|E
5|$|Alister Murdoch {{was born}} on 9 December 1912 in Elsternwick, Victoria, the son of {{engineer}} Thomas Murdoch and his wife Kathleen. A lieutenant in the Commonwealth Military Forces {{at the time of}} Alister's birth, Thomas was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in World WarI, and rose to the rank of brigardier as Director General of Engineer Services in World WarII. Educated at Caulfield Grammar School, Alister entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in 1929, following his elder brother Ian (later a major general). Alister was one of four cadets sponsored that year by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), which did not <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>stage</b> have its own officer training college. Budgetary constraints imposed during the Great Depression necessitated the transfer of these cadets out of Duntroon midway through their four-year course. Although offered positions in the Australian Public Service or nominations for short-term commissions with the Royal Air Force, all were determined to serve with the RAAF and were more than pleased with the prospect of entering their chosen service early.|$|E
5|$|If an {{underlying}} muscle disease is suspected, for instance {{if there is}} no obvious explanation or there have been multiple episodes, {{it may be necessary to}} perform further investigations. During an attack, low levels of carnitine in the blood and high levels of acylcarnitine in blood and urine may indicate a lipid metabolism defect, but these abnormalities revert to normal during convalescence. Other tests may be used <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>stage</b> to demonstrate these disorders. Disorders of glycolysis can be detected by various means, including the measurement of lactate after exercise; a failure of the lactate to rise may be indicative of a disorder in glycolysis, while an exaggerated response is typical of mitochondrial diseases. Electromyography (EMG) may show particular patterns in specific muscle diseases; for instance, McArdle's disease and phosphofructokinase deficiency show a phenomenon called cramp-like contracture. There are genetic tests available for many of the hereditary muscle conditions that predispose to myoglobinuria and rhabdomyolysis.|$|E

5|$|In August 1999, the {{architect}} informed the project group that the Parliament {{would need to}} be further increased in size by 4,000squaremetres (43,000sqft). A subsequent costing revealed that taking into account the increased floorspace net construction costs had risen to £115m by September 1999. Early in 2000, the SPCB commissioned an independent report by {{the architect}} John Spencely. The report concluded that savings of 20% could be made on the current project and that scrapping the project completely <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>stage</b> or moving to another site would entail additional costs of £30m. Spencely also cited poor communication between the SPCB and construction officials as increasingly costly. Given the outcomes of the Spencely report, MSPs voted to continue with the construction project on the Holyrood site in a debate in the Scottish Parliament on 5 April 2000.|$|E
5|$|In a draw made {{prior to}} the quarter-finals, it was {{determined}} that the winner of the match between Cardiff and Toulouse would have home country advantage, meaning that they could choose any venue in their own country for the semi-finals, provided it was not their designated home ground. The winner of the match between Leicester and Bath was drawn against them as the away team. Cardiff elected to stage the game at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, which is located adjacent to their usual Cardiff Arms Park ground and has a much larger capacity of 74,500, compared to the 12,500 capacity of the Arms Park. Cardiff had already moved their quarter-final game against Toulouse to the Millennium Stadium, despite being able to use their own ground <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>stage</b> of the competition, {{to take advantage of the}} increased capacity.|$|E
5|$|Meikle {{signed for}} National League club Macclesfield Town on 25 September 2015 on non-contract terms, {{and made his}} debut a day later as a 67th-minute {{substitute}} for Danny Rowe in a 3–0 away win over Aldershot Town. He was released by Macclesfield in November 2015 after making seven appearances for the club, and was denied a move to Barrow by the Football Association as he could not join a third club <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>stage</b> of the season. Meikle joined Alfreton Town of the National League North on 3 December 2015, making his debut two days later when starting their 1–0 away defeat to Lowestoft Town. He scored his first goal with a 12-yard curling shot in the 69th-minute of a 2–1 away win over Tamworth on 26 December 2015. On 6 January 2016, Meikle signed a new contract with Alfreton {{to the end of}} the season, having initially joined on a one-month non-contract basis. He made 23 appearances and scored 3 goals as Alfreton finished 10th in the National League North in 2015–16.|$|E

5|$|Soon after {{resuming}} his naval duties, Scott {{revealed to}} the Royal Geographical Society his intention to return to Antarctica, but the information was not <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>stage</b> made public. Scott was forestalled by Shackleton, who early in 1907 announced his plans to lead an expedition with the twin objectives of reaching the geographic and magnetic South Poles. Under duress, Shackleton agreed not to work from McMurdo Sound, which Scott was claiming as his own sphere of work. In the event, {{unable to find a}} safe landing elsewhere, Shackleton was forced to break this promise. His expedition was highly successful, its southern march ending at 88°23′, less than 100 geographical miles from the South Pole, while its northern party reached the location of the South Magnetic Pole. However, Shackleton's breach of his undertaking caused a significant break in relations between the two men, with Scott dismissing his former companion as a liar and a rogue.|$|E
5|$|The army group's {{previous}} commander, Georg von Küchler, had {{pleaded for}} permission to withdraw to the Panther Line in Estonia, which was still only half-completed <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>stage.</b> Model immediately cracked down on such talk, instituting a new policy he called Shield and Sword (Schild und Schwert). Under this doctrine, ground would only temporarily be ceded, to gather reserves for an immediate counter-attack that would drive the Red Army back and relieve pressure on {{other areas of the}} front. These statements of aggressive intent won over Hitler and OKH, who had no substantial reserves to send him, but were still unwilling to lose territory. Historians have since debated their significance, some claiming that Shield and Sword was Hitler's invention, while others say they were a calculated ploy by Model to disguise his true intent—to pull back to the Panther Line.|$|E
5|$|The first {{church on}} {{this site was}} {{established}} by Cwyllog, a female saint, in the 6th century, although the exact date is unknown. She {{was one of the}} daughters of St Caw, a king in northern Britain who lost his lands and sought safety with his family in Anglesey, where the ruler Maelgwn Gwynedd gave him land. There was a church here {{at the time of the}} Norwich Taxation in 1254, and the present walls may date from around 1200. In the 13th century, the church was under the control of the Augustinian canons of the priory at Penmon, on the east of Anglesey, with the priory gaining the income from the tithes paid to the church. The priory gradually diminished in size and importance, and in 1522 the prior and two canons (the entire community, <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>stage)</b> affixed their signature to the lease of Llangywllog church to Richard Bulkeley (a member of a prominent family from the Anglesey town of Beaumaris) for the period of 100 years at an annual rent of £1.|$|E

5|$|This changed dramatically, however, {{following}} {{the entry of}} Japan into the war on 8 December 1941, with the attack on Pearl Harbor and on the British forces in Malaya. Suddenly the war was brought to Australia's doorstep {{and there was a}} risk that the Japanese could attempt to invade the Australian mainland. In April 1942, the threat of invasion of Australia seemed very real {{following the}} loss of Malaya and Singapore and the subsequent Japanese landings in New Guinea. Seeing the threat that the Japanese posed to Australia, the government had begun to bring AIF units back from the Middle East but the bulk of the forces immediately available for the defence of Australia came from the militia, which was <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>stage</b> an organisation of some 265,000 men organised into five infantry and two cavalry divisions.|$|E
5|$|Tzara became {{involved}} {{in a number of}} Dada experiments, on which he collaborated with Breton, Aragon, Soupault, Picabia or Paul Éluard. Other authors who came into contact with Dada <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>stage</b> were Jean Cocteau, Paul Dermée and Raymond Radiguet. The performances staged by Dada were often meant to popularize its principles, and Dada continued to draw attention on itself by hoaxes and false advertising, announcing that the Hollywood film star Charlie Chaplin was going to appear on stage at its show, or that its members were going to have their heads shaved or their hair cut off on stage. In another instance, Tzara and his associates lectured at the Université populaire in front of industrial workers, who were reportedly less than impressed. Richter believes that, ideologically, Tzara was still in tribute to Picabia's nihilistic and anarchic views (which made the Dadaists attack all political and cultural ideologies), but that this also implied a measure of sympathy for the working class.|$|E
5|$|Unlike their adversaries, the South Vietnamese {{military}} suffered {{heavily in}} their attempts to recapture the village of Bình Giã and secure the surrounding areas. The South Vietnamese and their American allies lost the total of about 201 personnel killed in action, 192 wounded and 68 missing. In just four days of fighting, two of South Vietnam's elite Ranger companies were destroyed and several others suffered heavy losses, while the 4th Marine Battalion was rendered ineffective as a fighting force. <b>At</b> <b>that</b> <b>stage</b> of the war, Bình Giã was the worst defeat experienced by the South Vietnamese. Despite their losses, the South Vietnamese army considered the battle as their victory and erected a monument {{at the site of the}} battle to acknowledge the sacrifices of the soldiers who had fallen to retake Bình Giã.|$|E
