Engineering soft rock is divided into four categories: expansive soft rock (or low-pressure soft rock), high-stress soft rock, fractured soft rock and composite soft rock...|$|R

40|$|Due {{to changes}} in the Swedish design code in 1994, timber {{construction}} is no longer limited to two-storey buildings. This change has created an attractive market for multi-storey timber structures. A Scandinavian glulam manufacturer, Moelven Töreboda, started in 2007 to develop a new beam and post building system in timber for multi-storey buildings with the Swedish commercial name, “trä 8 ”. For “trä 8 ”, the stabilising system is based on prefabricated wall panels placed at a few locations in the building. The stabilising elements consist of double sheathing of LVL Kerto-Q boards glued and screwed to a glulam frame. The panels are typically of 2. 4 m width and continuous up to four storey height. The elements are fixed to the foundation by using <b>special</b> <b>anchoring</b> devices, which include threaded rods glued-in lengthwise in the timber member. In this paper, an introductory experimental study of the efficiency of this prefabricated wall panel used as a stabilising element is reported. Experimental results from full-scale testing of the racking performance of the stabilising element including the anchoring device are presented. The study, which focuses on the stiffness and the serviceability state, demonstrates that the presented wall panel elements, as part of a beam and post system for multi-storey buildings, have the potential to provide the necessary horizontal stability for the building.

40|$|The present paper {{describes}} the experimental and analytical {{findings of a}} project focused on the structural strengthening of reinforced concrete (RC) spandrel beams using carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite laminates, and subjected to pure torsion. Current torsional strengthening and repair methods are time and resource intensive, and quite often very intrusive. The proposed method however, uses composite laminates to increase the torsional capacity of concrete beams. Six identical spandrel beams were built and tested. Two of the beams were considered as baseline specimens, the remaining four were strengthened using three different composite laminates. In order to eliminate the flexural and shear forces on the beam, a close to pure twisting force was applied {{at the end of}} the beam specimen. In traditional cast-in-place construction the slab adjacent to the spandrel beam does not allow a complete wrap around the beam. To simulate this, the CFRP laminate was provided only on three sides of the beam, and <b>special</b> <b>anchors</b> were used to allow a continuous torsional shear flow around the specimens. The experiments showed that this method increased the torsional strength of the spandrel beams up to 113 %. Excessive concrete cracking followed by composite delamination caused the specimen failure. An equation was also developed which, for most of the specimens, accurately predicted the composite contribution. This analytical procedure was based on the existing information on the torsional resistance provided by closed stirrups, and on the equations developed to design the composite shear retrofit of RC beams...|$|R

30|$|Calibration-based {{solutions}} use fingerprints {{of average}} RSS values over a specific duration at specific locations {{in order to}} diminish the impact of variation in the RSS values [28 – 30]. Even though calibration-based techniques provide more localization accuracy than calibration-free, they require extensive efforts to collect the calibration data. This problem rises dramatically in dynamic environments since {{any change in the}} environment or the configuration, requires new calibration data to be collected. To address this issue, a number of methodologies were proposed to reduce the time required to collect the calibration data. For example, in [31], an effortless indoor Wi-Fi solution that leverages the floor plan and walls within the environments to generate RSS maps of access points and the target node location is estimated using a map overlapping technique. This work eliminates the necessary time to survey the environment. However, it does not address the changes of RSS due to changes in the environment over time, to provide accurate results. In [32], a novel algorithm that solves the problem of regenerating calibration dataset was proposed. In this approach, access points with custom-made firmware were allowed to scan the channel and record RSS levels of each other, as well as the RSS level of a <b>special</b> <b>anchor</b> device. It also requires the mobile device to be in an access point mode in order to send beacon frames and allow other nodes in the system to connect to it. Although, in [31, 32], good attempts were made to solve the limitations of fingerprinting methods, these are client-server-based techniques and cannot be adapted for distributed Wi-Fi location identification systems.|$|R

40|$|AbstractPre-stressing of masonry {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} building/facility reconstruction methods. In the Czech Republic it is very successful, especially in the Moravian-Silesian Region, which is subject to a considerable amount of disturbances of buildings/facilities due to undermining. Pre-stressing in masonry can be achieved by means of steel wire ropes or rods. These steel elements are inserted into the pre-milled grooves, which may be in the external or internal wall face. The ends of the steel elements are clamped into steel angles or <b>special</b> <b>anchors.</b> In these reconstruction methods it is necessary to follow the pre- stressing procedures and technologies. It is important to properly select the pre-stressing anchoring system, appropriate layout and arrangement of pre-stressing wires, pre-stressing procedure and dimension of pre-stressing forces in the individual wires. This contribution deals with experimental measurements of deformations in the place exposed to local load caused by additional pre-stressing. The measurements are taken on a masonry corner built in the laboratory equipment. This laboratory equipment was designed at the Faculty of Civil Engineering VSB – TU Ostrava for measurement of the tri-axial stress-strain conditions in masonry. Two pre-stressing bars are placed in this masonry corner. These bars are at different heights and are anchored to the anchor plates, which transfer pre-stressing forces to the masonry. The specimen for laboratory testing is performed at the actual proportion of 1 : 1. Mathematical modeling of the brick corner is based on the finite element method using ANSYS software and then the results are compared with results of the laboratory tests. On the basis of these results it should be possible to improve the models and come closer to achieving an accurate and at the same time, simple procedure for the design of pre-stressed masonry...|$|R
