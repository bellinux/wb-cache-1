5|$|Dinosaurs {{have always}} been an {{extremely}} varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, over 500non-avian dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and {{the total number of}} genera preserved in the fossil record has been estimated at around1850, nearly 75% of which remain to be discovered. <b>An</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>study</b> predicted that about 3400dinosaur genera existed, including many {{that would not have been}} preserved in the fossil record.

The compounds 3-octanone, 1-octen-3-ol, and (Z)-3-octen-1-ol are the predominant {{components of the}} volatile chemicals that give the puffball its odor and flavor. Extracts of the puffball contain relatively high levels of antimicrobial activity against the human pathogenic bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with an efficiency {{comparable to that of}} the antibiotic ampicillin. These results corroborate <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>study</b> that additionally reported antibacterial activity against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Mycobacterium smegmatis. Extracts of the puffball have also been reported to have antifungal activity against Candida albicans, C.tropicalis, Aspergillus fumigatus, Alternaria solani, Botrytis cinerea, and Verticillium dahliae. A 2009 study found L.perlatum puffballs to contain the phenolic compound cinnamic acid at a concentration of about 14milligrams per kilogram of mushroom.

Instead, the authors of the publication suggested ichthyostegalians as trackmakers, based on available pes morphology of those animals. However, a paper published in 2015 that undertook a critical review of Devonian tetrapod footprints called into question the designation of the Zachelmie marks and instead suggested an origin as fish nests/feeding traces. <b>An</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>study</b> in 2012 indicated that Zachelmie trackmakers were even more advanced than Ichthyostega in terms of quadrupedalism.

[...] <b>An</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>study,</b> conducted in other regions of southern Tasmania, examined the relationship between the moth and Eucalyptus regnans and E.obliqua and reached the same conclusion. [...] The tunnelling and feeding habit of A.latipennis larvae on the roots of these two eucalypt species is mostly responsible for its abundance in clearfelled forests, as the trees are the typical regrowth of logged areas. [...] This success may also be due in part to the caterpillar's lack of dependence on decaying vegetation, a characteristic of the Abantiades genus and dissimilar to other Tasmanian genera—such as Eudonia and Barea—that have not fared as well in clearfelled forest.|$|E
