However the resultant elevation in post-stimulus blood volume decays with an extremely long time constant, taking more than 55 s to recover to baseline following a 4. 8 s stimulus.

40|$|Continuous {{monitoring}} of cardiac output {{is important in}} patients who are undergoing intensive care, thoracic surgery or a catheterization for diagnostic reasons. In these patients arterial pressure is routinely determined. In the patients, who are undergoing a catheterization for diagnostic reasons, aortic pressure is detennined. During intensive care and thoracic surgery arterial pressure is determined in both the pulmonary artery and the artery femoralis or radialis. The radial or femoral catheter is a replacement of the pressure catheter in the aorta. To detennine cardiac output continuously from an arterial pressure signal, the aortic pressure was reconstructed from the peripheral pressure [Wesseling et al. 1976, Gratz et al. 1992]. For this continuous cardiac output monitoring from aortic pressure, {{a model of the}} circulation is used. A parameter of this model is the compliance of the arterial system, which is the change in volume per unit of length (i. e. segmental volume) over a change in pressure. The compliance is derived from in vitro measurements using a selected group of human aorta's [Langewouters 1984]. Cardiac output can also be detelmined from the pulmonary arterial pressure signal, which is directly measured in this artery. Thus, a reconstruction of this pressure signal is not needed. To calculate right ventricular output, i. e. cardiac output, according to a pulse contour method, we detennined the pulmonary arterial compliance.

40|$|BACKGROUND Postural {{changes are}} related to changes in {{cerebrospinal}} fluid (CSF) dynamics. While sitting up leads to a decrease in cranial CSF pressure, it also causes shifts in the craniospinal CSF volume and compliance distribution. We hypothesized that jugular vein collapse in upright posture is {{a major contributor to}} these shifts in CSF volume and compliance. METHODS To test this hypothesis, we implemented a mathematical lumped-parameter model of the CSF system and the relevant parts of the cardiovascular system. In this model, the CSF and the venous system are each divided into a cranial and a spinal part. The pressures in these cranial and spinal portions differ by the posture-dependent hydrostatic pressure columns in the connecting vessels. Jugular collapse is represented by a reduction of the hydrostatic pressure difference between cranial and spinal veins. The CSF pressure-volume relationship is implemented {{as a function of the}} local CSF to venous pressure gradient. This implies that an increase in CSF volume leads to a simultaneous displacement of blood from adjacent veins. CSF pulsations driven by the cardiovascular system are introduced through a pulsating cranial <b>arterial</b> <b>volume.</b> RESULTS In upright posture, the implemented CSF pressure-volume relationship shifts to lower cranial CSF pressures compared to the horizontal position, leading to a decrease in cranial CSF pressure when sitting up. Concurrently, the compliance of the spinal compartment decreases while the one of the cranial compartment increases. With this, in upright posture only 10 % of the CSF system's compliance is provided by the spinal compartment compared to 35 % in horizontal posture. This reduction in spinal compliance is accompanied by a caudal shift of CSF volume. Also, the ability of the spinal CSF compartment to compensate for cerebral <b>arterial</b> <b>volume</b> pulsations reduces in upright posture, which in turn reduces the calculated craniospinal CSF flow pulsations. CONCLUSION The mathematical model enabled us to isolate the effect of jugular collapse and quantify the induced shifts of compliance and CSF volume. The good concordance of the modelled changes with clinically observed values indicates that jugular collapse can be considered a major contributor to CSF dynamics in upright posture...|$|E

Furthermore, we assessed carotid arterial compliance using ultrasound images to compare with API. Results The slope of the calculated pressure-volume curve was steeper for compliant (low baPWV or cfPWV) than stiff (high baPWV or cfPWV) arteries.
