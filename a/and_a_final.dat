5|$|Despite the obstacles, {{readers and}} {{commentators}} {{have reached a}} broad consensus about the book's central cast of characters and, to a lesser degree, its plot, but key details remain elusive. The book discusses, in an unorthodox fashion, the Earwicker family, comprising the father HCE, the mother ALP, {{and their three children}} Shem the Penman, Shaun the Postman, and Issy. Following an unspecified rumour about HCE, the book, in a nonlinear dream narrative, follows his wife's attempts to exonerate him with a letter, his sons' struggle to replace him, Shaun's rise to prominence, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>final</b> monologue by ALP at the break of dawn. The opening line of the book is a sentence fragment which continues from the book's unfinished closing line, making the work a never-ending cycle. Many noted Joycean scholars such as Samuel Beckett and Donald Phillip Verene link this cyclical structure to Giambattista Vico's seminal text La Scienza Nuova ("The New Science"), upon which they argue Finnegans Wake is structured.|$|E
5|$|During September and October of the 1999–2000 season, Boulding {{scored in}} four {{successive}} league games. However, {{he could only}} score another two goals {{during the rest of}} the campaign to once again record a tally of six goals. His last goal came only two minutes after he had come on as a substitute during Mansfield's penultimate game of the season against Scunthorpe United, which helped the team to their fourth successive home victory <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>final</b> league position of 13th. Boulding's two-year contract with Mansfield had finished and he left after playing 74appearances in all competitions for Mansfield, of which 41 were as a substitute. During his two seasons he scored 12goals, all in the league.|$|E
5|$|Each {{season of}} the series is played as a nine-episode tournament with six episodes of opening rounds, two semi-finals, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>final.</b> Each opening round starts with three teams of three contestants {{answering}} questions about the Bible. The teams then nominate their strongest contestants to answer questions by themselves without any assistance from their teammates. After {{this part of the}} round, the third-placed team is eliminated and the two highest-scoring teams compete in a final round with the scores being reset to zero. The remaining teams answer as many questions correctly as possible within one minute, and the highest-scoring team from this round wins a $20,000 prize which is given to the team's nominated charity. The winning team then advances to a semi-final game against two other winning teams; the winning team from this game advances to a final game where the grand prize is raised to $100,000. Thus, the team that wins the season-long tournament earns a total of $140,000 for their charity.|$|E

5|$|Hereditary {{senators}} and equites combined military service with civilian posts, a career path {{known as the}} cursus honorum, typically starting with a period of junior administrative posts in Rome, followed by 5–10 years in the military <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>final</b> period of senior positions in either the provinces or Rome. This tiny, tightly-knit ruling oligarchy of under 10,000 men monopolised political, military and economic power in an empire of c. 80 million inhabitants and achieved a remarkable degree of political stability. During the first 200 years of its existence (30 BC – 180 AD), the empire suffered only one major episode of civil strife (the Civil War of 68–9). Otherwise, usurpation attempts by provincial governors were few and swiftly suppressed.|$|E
5|$|In 1712, Britain and France {{declared}} an armistice, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>final</b> peace agreement was signed the following year. Under {{terms of the}} 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, Britain gained Acadia (which they renamed Nova Scotia), sovereignty over Newfoundland, the Hudson Bay region, and the Caribbean island of St. Kitts. France recognized British suzerainty over the Iroquois and agreed that commerce with American Indians farther inland {{would be open to}} all nations. It retained all of the islands in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, including Cape Breton Island, and retained fishing rights in the area, including rights to dry fish on the northern shore of Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{four teams}} {{participated in the}} competition, which {{featured}} two semi-finals, a third-place play-off, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>final.</b> For the first competition in 1966, Barcelona were joined by Belgium's R.S.C. Anderlecht, France's FC Nantes, and Germany's FC Köln. Barcelona beat the German team 3–1 in the final. Köln subsequently won the competition in 1978 and 1981 and were runners-up in 1979, making them the only team, other than the hosts, to win the competition more than once. The next edition saw the first appearance of another Spanish team, Atlético Madrid, who along with the hosts, were joined by German side Bayern Munich, and Argentina's Boca Juniors. The latter two clubs {{are among the most}} regular guests. Bayern were runners-up in 1984, 1987 and 2006, while Boca became the first of several South American guests to be invited and have since returned in 1977, 1984, 2003 and 2008. The only non-European team to win the tournament was Brazil's Internacional, in 1982.|$|E

5|$|Next, {{the train}} passes through two {{consecutive}} horseshoe turns, {{first to the}} right and then to the left. As the name suggests, Horseshoe turns are highly banked horseshoe-shaped turns which feature track entering from roughly the same direction as where it exits. As the train exits the second horseshoe, it swoops down and begins a 270-degree helix to the right, which leads into the ride's second inversion, an inline twist. The inline twist sees riders perform a full rotation around the track, starting from a position where they are facing downward. After completing the twist, the train reaches the brake run <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>final</b> right-hand turn that leads back into the station.|$|E
5|$|On 17 December 2008, Allardyce was {{appointed}} {{as manager of}} Blackburn Rovers on a three-year contract, succeeding Paul Ince who left the club in 19th place with just three wins from 17 games. Allardyce's first game in charge was a 3–0 victory over Stoke City at Ewood Park three days later. This was {{the first game of}} a nine-game unbeaten run. He strengthened the team by spending £2million on Sunderland winger El Hadji Diouf and brought in defender Gaël Givet on loan from Marseille. Allardyce finished his first season in charge with a 0–0 draw with West Bromwich Albion <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>final</b> league position of 15th.|$|E
5|$|On March 21, 1942, Davis {{enlisted in}} the United States Army in Lubbock, Texas, just after the US entry into World War II.

He was then moved to Jones Field in Bonham, Texas for primary flight training. During this training, {{he got his first}} 60 hours of flight time aboard a Fairchild PT-19 trainer aircraft. Then, he flew for another 74 hours during Basic Flight Training in Waco, Texas <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>final</b> stint of training aboard the T-6 Texan at Aloe Field in Victoria, Texas. On February 16, 1943, Davis completed his training and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the US Army Reserve, and immediately ordered to active duty with the Army Air Forces.

The 96th Street station cavern, as well as existing tunnels, would allow the first phase's trackage to run from 62nd to 105th Streets. Before construction started, the MTA revised their plans so that the construction of the section between 62nd and 65th Streets was postponed.|$|E
