25|$|The range {{covered by}} a hook move is the {{equivalent}} of two moves by a rook, or two moves by a bishop, depending on the piece. However, a hook move is functionally a single move: The piece cannot capture twice in one move, nor may it capture <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>move</b> <b>on.</b> It must stop before an intervening piece (unless it first changes direction to avoid it), and must stop when it captures, just like any other ranging piece. It can only change direction once per move.|$|E
25|$|In Move Mode, {{the player}} may advance or {{backtrack}} (limited) to previous screens. In {{a similar fashion}} to Look Mode, triggers {{will appear on the}} screen and a corresponding directional button must be pressed to move to them, adding a turn to the count. Unlike Look Mode, however, triggers in Move Mode do not require Trigger Points, so one may move as much as one likes, assuming there is no turn limit. Once the player has exited the final screen of a stage, the player will be prompted to save <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> to the next stage.|$|E
25|$|On Tuesday evening, {{the areas}} around Marktplatz, Barfüsserplatz and Claraplatz {{are devoted to}} Guggekonzerts by the Guggemusik groups, who take turns to play on {{purpose-built}} stages to large crowds. The main Guggekonzert at Marktplatz draws thousands of spectators and is broadcast live by Telebasel, the local TV channel. The traditional Cliques, which march while playing piccolos and Basler snare drums, retreat to the side streets. The Guggemusik groups march through the city centre, then stop and play four to five songs <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>move</b> <b>on.</b> Some Guggemusik groups are also invited to play in cafés and restaurants to serenade the guests.|$|E

25|$|When {{children}} reach about 15–18 {{months of}} age, language acquisition flourishes. There is {{a surge in}} word production resulting from {{the growth of the}} cortex. Infants begin to learn the words that form a sentence and within the sentence, the word endings can be interpreted. Elissa Newport and colleagues (1999) found that humans learn first about the sounds of a language, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> to how to speak the language. This shows how infants learn the end of a word and know that a new word is being spoken. From this step, infants are then able to determine the structure of a language and word.|$|E
25|$|Promotion {{from one}} geup {{to the next}} can proceed rapidly in some schools, since schools often allow geup {{promotions}} every two, three, or four months. Students of geup rank learn the most basic techniques first, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> to more advanced techniques as they approach first dan. Many of the older and more traditional schools often take longer to allow students to test for higher ranks than newer, more contemporary schools, as {{they may not have}} the required testing intervals. In contrast, promotion from one dan to the next can take years. In fact, some styles impose age or time-in-rank limits on dan promotions. For example, the number of years between one dan promotion to the next may be limited to a minimum of the practitioner's current dan-rank, so that (for example) a 5th dan practitioner must wait 5 years to test for 6th dan.|$|E
500|$|A joint {{program with}} UC Hastings enables UC Santa Cruz {{students}} {{to earn a}} bachelor's degree and law degree in six years {{instead of the usual}} seven. [...] The [...] "3+3 BA/JD" [...] Program between UC Santa Cruz and UC Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco accepted its first applicants in fall 2014. [...] UCSC students who declare their intent in their freshman or early sophomore year will complete three years at UCSC <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> to UC Hastings to begin the three-year law curriculum. Credits from the first year of law school will count toward a student's bachelor's degree. Students who successfully complete the first-year law course work will receive their bachelor's degree and be able to graduate with their UCSC class, then continue at UC Hastings afterwards for two years.|$|E

500|$|The CW {{was looking}} to create a female-driven action series. Creator Craig Silverstein {{discussed}} with Warner Bros. about the previous incarnations of Nikita (the original 1990 film, and La Femme Nikita) and wished to make the current television series look fresh. Silverstein wanted to follow Nikita after she left the agency, as that chapter was yet to be told in the previous incarnations. He also believed it {{would have done the}} original story justice. Also, he wanted to include a highlight of Nikita's original story in the pilot to earn the title, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> from there. Silverstein described Nikita's transition in a Collider interview; [...] "It's a dark fairytale. This girl is taken from one life, her identity is erased, she's put in another life and she's transformed. It's like Alice in Wonderland. She's told, [...] "Eat this, drink that, steal this, kill that," [...] and she's not told why. And, she begins to find her own identity through that. It's just a great story." ...|$|E
500|$|The Bombardment of San Juan or the First Battle of San Juan (not to be {{confused}} with the Battle of San Juan Hill or the Battle for the Río San Juan de Nicaragua) refers to an American naval attack on the fortifications of San Juan, Puerto Rico during the Spanish–American War. The American Naval commanders believed the bulk of the Spanish Fleet under Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete was steaming from the Cape Verde Islands to the Antilles and ultimately to Puerto Rico. [...] With this understanding, Rear Admiral William T. Sampson and a squadron of ten American warships, the battleships , , , cruisers [...] and , monitors [...] and , torpedo boat , two unidentified auxiliary cruisers, and an unarmed collier had stood out from Havana at noon on May 2 bound for Puerto Rico. [...] Sampson intended to intercept and destroy the Spanish squadron <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> to attack secondary shore targets- San Juan's castles, forts and batteries. He was unaware that Topete had already eluded them and slipped his squadron into the Bay of Santiago.|$|E
500|$|The {{first series}} began filming in November 2001, and {{continued}} until March 2002. Shooting took place almost entirely in London, with many rural scenes filmed around South East England. Each episode took approximately 12 to 14 days to shoot, {{although they do}} not follow {{on the order of}} the script; the production crew would film all scenes set at a certain location first, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> to the rest. Between 40 and 50 cuts were made in the first 10 minutes of the pilot episode to quickly introduce the main characters. Filming was usually done with long lens cameras, which proved difficult for the crew as many filming location were short on space. The scenes where Tom reveals he is a spy to Ellie in [...] "Traitor's Gate" [...] were filmed using hand-held cameras, the first time they were used in the series. By the time the crew filmed the series finale, hand-held cameras were mostly used. The cameras allowed for more intimate filming as opposed to shoulder-operated cameras. The downside to the hand-held cameras was that they can only shoot four minutes worth of footage from each film stock. In addition, the operators at first hated using the cameras.|$|E

500|$|Chimes, {{whose career}} {{aspirations}} owed {{little to the}} punk ethos, had left the band again soon after the recording sessions. He later said, [...] "The point was I wanted one kind of life and they wanted another and, like, why are we working together, if we want completely different things?" [...] As a result, only Simonon, Jones and Strummer were featured on the album's cover, and Chimes was credited as [...] "Tory Crimes". Strummer later described what followed: [...] "We must have tried every drummer that then had a kit. I mean every drummer in London. I think we counted 205. And that's why we were lost until we found Topper Headon." [...] Headon, who had played briefly with Jones's London SS, was nicknamed [...] "Topper" [...] by Simonon, who felt he resembled the Topper comic book character Mickey the Monkey. An excellent musician, Headon could also play piano, bass and guitar. The day after he signed up, he declared, [...] "I really wanted to join the Clash. I {{want to give them}} even more energy than they've got—if that's possible"; interviewed over two decades later, he said his original plan was to stay briefly, gain a name for himself, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> to a better gig. In any event, Strummer later observed, [...] "Finding someone who not only had the chops, but the strength and the stamina to do it was just the breakthrough for us".|$|E
500|$|Claudia Black {{joined the}} cast {{full-time}} in season 10. Had Stargate SG-1 not {{been picked up}} for a new season, the producers would have considered the character for a spin-off series. To justify the character in a regular capacity, the producers toned her down and {{tried to find a}} suitable balance of sexual tension, fun and friendship. Claudia Black was convinced that Vala's actual stay with Stargate Command was justified despite the character's personality. Vala's renegade qualification to infiltrate the Ori served as a useful complement to the military-oriented SG teams, and Vala had already proven a degree of allegiance through her actions in [...] "Beachhead", holding off an immediate invasion of the enemy. The writers tested this loyalty through confrontation in the story, and writer Damian Kindler later compared Vala's character growth in season 10 to smuggler Lando Calrissian from Star Wars, a [...] "former swindler who's gone legit". Careful to never have Vala become too earnest, Kindler never saw Vala [...] "as the type of character who should be on the show for five, six, seven years. But definitely the sort of character who could come in for a couple of seasons, spice things up <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> and come back and forth." [...] Evolving the relationship between Vala and the other SG-1 members, the producers also grew comfortable with pairing Browder's and Black's characters more often, and even teased (and misled) viewers about them [...] "end up in a motel room bed together" [...] in the episode [...] "Memento Mori", involving underwear, [...] "handcuffs as well as creamy Twinkies". A scene in the milestone episode [...] "200" [...] also parodied the show's connection to Farscape. In hindsight, Claudia Black would see season 10 as a personal challenge as her baby deprived her of sleep during the filming period. Her relocation to Vancouver and sickness in the family put her on a self-confessed personal and professional low. She nevertheless tried to stay true to her character [...] "and not go for the cheap laugh".|$|E
