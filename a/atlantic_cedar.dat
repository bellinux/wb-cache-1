40|$|Force (Air Force) {{assessed}} the potential environmental consequences {{associated with the}} restoration of 83 acres of <b>Atlantic</b> white <b>cedar</b> at the Dare County Range, Dare County, North Carolina. The purpose of the proposed action is to regenerate <b>Atlantic</b> white <b>cedar</b> stands in degraded condition to ensure the stands are not replaced with hardwood stands. This project is needed because the results of forest inventories have indicated competition-induced mortality and declining conditions of the <b>Atlantic</b> white <b>cedar</b> stands on the Dare County Range. <b>Atlantic</b> white <b>cedar</b> {{is considered to be}} imperiled by NatureServe and the North Carolina Natural Heritage Program. The Environmental Assessment (EA), incorporated by reference into this finding, analyzes the potential environmental consequences of activities associated with the regeneration of 83 acres of <b>Atlantic</b> white <b>cedar,</b> and provides environmental protection measures to avoid or reduce adverse environmental impacts. The EA considers all potential impacts of Alternative A (Proposed Action) and the No-Action Alternative. The EA also considers cumulative environmental impacts with other projects at the Dare County Range.

50|$|Cattus Island Park also {{contains}} freshwater wetlands. These wetlands {{are dominated by}} hardwood trees such as Red Maple or Swamp Maple, Sour Gum or Tupelo and {{a wide variety of}} others. There are a few small stands of living <b>Atlantic</b> White <b>Cedar</b> located in some of the wetland areas. However, in this area, large stands of dead <b>Atlantic</b> white <b>cedar</b> also exist. They have been standing dead since the 1930s. Prior to the 1930s, {{the northern part of the}} Barnegat Bay, where Cattus Island is located, was mainly fresh water. After the Point Pleasant Canal was constructed and the Manasquan inlet improved, saltwater from the ocean infiltrated into the Northern portion of the bay. As a result, the <b>Atlantic</b> white <b>cedar,</b> which is an obligate freshwater species, was killed.|$|R

50|$|Historically, the {{softwoods}} {{used for}} decking were logged from old growth forests. These include <b>Atlantic</b> white <b>cedar,</b> redwood and Western red <b>cedar</b> (redcedar). <b>Atlantic</b> City {{built the first}} coastal boardwalk in the United States, originally constructed of <b>Atlantic</b> white <b>cedar.</b> However, {{it was not long}} before the commercial logging of this tree and clearing of cedar swamps in New Jersey caused a decline in the availability of decking. Atlantic City and New York City both switched to Western red cedar. By the 1960s, Western red cedar from the US was declining due to over-logging. More expensive Western red cedar was available from western Canada (British Columbia) but by then, pressure treated pine had become available.|$|R
50|$|Before Long Beach Island was developed, its {{northern}} area, from the Barnegat Inlet to the Great Swamp (now Surf City), {{was covered with}} <b>Atlantic</b> white <b>cedar</b> (chamaecyparis thyoides).
