Radon entry into slab on grade dwellings has been modeled in the RAETRAD code and applied to conditions in florida as part of the Florida Radon Research Program. RAETRAD solves the two-dimensional radon balance and air pressure balance equations in cylindrical geometry. Key factors in the simplicity of RAETRAD are the simple correlations for predicting gas permeabilities and radon diffusion coefficients for the porous soil and house slab materials. Use of RAETRAD reveals that diffusive transport effects are significant and may even dominate for typical long-term average house pressure differentials.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} documents {{research results}} {{from a series of}} field experiments and analyses used to test interpretive models for investigating the role of fractures in fluid flow through unsaturated, fractured tuffs. It summarizes the experimental design of single- and cross-hole pneumatic injection tests, including borehole configuration and testing schedules, data collection system, interpretive models developed and tested, data, and conclusions. Single-hole tests were interpreted by Guzman et al. (1996) by means of steady-state analysis to obtain permeability values based solely on late pressure data. This dissertation and Illman et al. (1998) employ pressure and pressure-derivative type-curves to analyze transient data. <b>Air</b> <b>permeabilities</b> determined from transient analyses agree well with those derived from steady-state analyses. Cross-hole pneumatic tests were analyzed by means of a graphical matching procedure using newly-developed pressure and pressure-derivative type-curves. Analyses of pressure data from individual monitoring intervals using these new type-curves, under the assumption that the rock acts as a uniform and isotropic fractured porous continuum, yield results that are comparable with parameters obtained from a numerical inverse procedure described in Illman et al. (1998). The results include information about pneumatic connections between the injection and monitoring intervals, corresponding directional <b>air</b> <b>permeabilities,</b> and air-filled porosities. Together with the results of earlier site investigations, single- and cross-hole test analyses reveal that at the Apache Leap Research Site in central Arizona: (1) the pneumatic pressure behavior of fractured tuff is amenable to analysis by methods that treat the rock as a continuum on scales ranging from meters to tens of meters; (2) this continuum is representative primarily, but not exclusively, of interconnected fractures; (3) its pneumatic properties vary strongly with location, direction and scale, in particular, the mean of pneumatic permeabilities increases, and their variance decreases with scale; (4) this scale effect is most probably due to the presence in the rock of various size fractures that are interconnected on a variety of scales; and (5) given a sufficiently large sample of spatially varying pneumatic rock properties on a given scale of measurement, these properties are amenable to analysis by geostatistical methods, which treat them as correlated random fields defined over a continuum...|$|R

40|$|When liquid {{packaging}} {{board is}} made aseptic in the filling machine the unsealed {{edges of the}} board are exposed to a mixture of water and hydrogen peroxide. A high level of liquid penetration may lead to aesthetic as well as functional defects. To {{be able to make}} a priori predictions of the edge wicking properties of a certain paperboard material is therefore of great interest to the paper industry as well as to packaging manufacturers. In this paper an extended multi-scale model of edge wicking in multi-ply paperboard is presented. The geometric and physical properties of the paperboard are modeled on the micro-scale, and include fillers and fines. The absolute <b>air</b> <b>permeabilities</b> and pore size distributions are validated with experimental and tomographic values. On the macro-scale random porosity and sizing distributions, time and sizing dependent contact angles, and inter-ply dependence are modeled. Arbitrary shapes of the paperboard are handled through an unstructured 3 D surface mesh. Stationary and transient edge wicking simulations are validated against experiments with excellent agreement. The simulations show that the diffusive menisci between the liquid and air phases together with the two-ply model is necessary to achieve good agreement with the transient edge wicking experiments...|$|R

Under urban conditions, a large one-time input of an organic amendment was made to the reconstituted soil. Two organic materials, green-waste compost (gw) or cocompost from sewage sludge and wood chips (sw), were mixed with sandy loam soil (40 % v/v) and placed in 600 -L containers. Containers received a 29 -cm thick layer of sandy loam soil–organic matter mix over a 28 -cm thick layer without organic amendment. Volumetric water content, dry bulk density, hydraulic conductivity at saturation and water retention were measured over 5 yrs in the soils and values for the mixes and a control compared. After this time, dry bulk density was greater (1. 54 g/cm 3) in control than in gw or sw soils (1. 31 and 1. 11 g/cm 3, respectively), whereas hydraulic conductivity at saturation was smaller (4 × 10 − 7 m/s) than in gw (3. 4 × 10 − 6) or sw (3. 7 × 10 − 6 m/s). HYDRUS 1 D water balance model indicated that below 27 cm depth in the control after 5 yrs, there was a high degree of anoxia, lasting > 200 days per year, compared with < 40 days in gw and sw.

40|$|In {{the forming}} {{section of a}} paper machine, a fiber {{suspension}} is flowing down onto a forming fabric, and a paper structure is formed. By using computer simulations this process can be studied, attaining new knowledge helping to improve paper quality and machine efficiency. In this thesis a suspension flow model is presented together with a simulation framework {{which is used to}} simulate early paper forming. Lay down simulations are performed, and the resulting sheets are compared with experiments. To properly resolve the frequent interactions between fibers, a physical interaction model has been developed. The suspension flow model consists of four sub-models: a fluid model, an object model, a fluid-object and object-fluid interaction model, and an object-object interaction model. The fluid model is based on the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and to capture the large motion and deformations of the fibers, a finite-strain beam model is used. The object's effect on the fluid is calculated using a second-order accurate immersed boundary method, and the fluid's effect on the fibers are resolved using an empirical drag force relation for cylinders. When a paper structure is formed the interactions between fibers are important. To resolve these interactions an object-object interaction model based on DLVO force has been developed. The model enables calculation of contact forces varying considerably over nanoscale distances without requiring the fiber time step to be reduced. In addition to the DLVO forces, a steric repulsion force has been developed handling the interaction taking place at the smallest separations including overlap. This work demonstrates the capacity of the presented framework, enabling computer simulations of the paper making process. Simulations are performed with thousands of fibers laying down onto a forming fabric, simultaneously resolving the complex interaction between fibers. For the simulated sheets with low density, the resulting <b>air</b> <b>permeabilities</b> agree well with experiments. When the density increases, the permeability of the simulated sheets does not decrease as much as in the experiments. This seems to be caused by some features missing in the current model. The fibers do not deform as tightly together as in the experiments, and the holes between fibers are not covered by fines. These features will be investigated in the future to improve the simulation framework further...|$|R
