5|$|It's my {{definitive}} {{statement in}} regards to the incredible pay-back I've received for having the nerve to talk <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> I did {{in the past few years}} with my Sex book and my record. It's getting it off my chest. It is defensive, absolutely. But it's also sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek. And I'm not sorry. I do not apologize for any of it.|$|E
500|$|Approximately 200 masked protesters {{gathered}} outside the Church of Scientology's headquarters in Adelaide, Australia. An anonymous spokesman told News.com.au that Scientology should lose its tax-exempt status. About 150 protesters {{came to the}} Yonge Street headquarters of Scientology in Toronto, Canada; sang [...] "Happy Birthday" [...] and chanted [...] "we want cake". During the Los Angeles protests, a plane flew overhead trailing a large sign that read [...] "Honk if you think Scientology is a cult." [...] 150 protesters demonstrated in Clearwater, Florida, and a local organizer for Anonymous told The Tampa Tribune, [...] "We feel {{that we have an}} obligation to educate the public <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> have gone on and hopefully make the Church of Scientology understand that they have to change." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Ballad of a Thin Man" [...] {{is driven}} by Dylan's piano, which {{contrasts}} with [...] "the spooky organ riffs" [...] played by Al Kooper. Marqusee describes the song as one of [...] "the purest songs of protest ever sung", as it looks at the media and its inability to understand both the singer and his work. He writes that the song became the anthem of an in-group, [...] "disgusted by the old, excited by the new... elated by their discovery of others who shared their feelings", with its refrain [...] "Something is happening here/ But you don't know what it is/ Do you, Mr Jones?" [...] epitomizing the [...] "hip exclusivity" [...] of the burgeoning counterculture. Robert Shelton describes the song's central character, Mr Jones, as [...] "one of Dylan's greatest archetypes", characterizing him as [...] "a Philistine... superficially educated and well bred but not very smart <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> count".|$|E

500|$|After three minutes, Madonna {{performs}} a rap naming {{the people who}} are working for her. Basically, we [...] had recorded the whole song and we had this instrumental thing at the end," [...] said Madonna, [...] "and Mirwais was like, 'You know what, you have to go and do a rap.' And I was like, 'Get out of here, I don't rap.' And he was like, 'Yeah you do. Just go in there, just do it.' He totally encouraged me. I had nothing planned, nothing written, and he just told me to do stream-of-consciousness, whatever I was thinking. Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> I like.' So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it. So it was totally spontaneous." ...|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{feature for}} [...] "Oathbreaker", showrunner Weiss stated of the Tower of Joy {{flashback}} that [...] "One {{of the best}} things about being able to go back with Bran and look at the past {{is to be able to}} see the discrepancy between the received history, the things that everybody knows <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> happened, and what actually happened." [...] Benioff continued, [...] "Every kid that grows up in Westeros, they all hear about this legendary sword fight that took place twenty years ago, and as far as Bran knew, it was just his father beat this legendary guy." [...] Weiss also stated [...] "Honor was so important to Ned Stark that it was worth losing his own life for, but he was completely ready to let go of that honor and excellence to do something that he really felt was more important. It could make a very, very strong defense for Ned doing what he did, and it certainly does puncture the mythology of Ned Stark that's running through this world, especially after his death." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} of Enough wanted Lopez {{to write a}} new song for the film. According to Lopez, writing a song is something that cannot be forced; [...] "It kinda just has to happen". While on their honeymoon in October 2001, Cris Judd played Lopez a melody that he had written on the piano. She thought that the melody was [...] "really beautiful" [...] {{and that it would}} make a [...] "wonderful song". Lopez felt that a [...] "little bit of it sounded like the movie, a little haunting". When she heard the melody, Lopez said to herself: [...] "I can write something to that right now. And we can use it in Enough". She then began to think about the film and the character that she portrays and what she had been through. In addition, she also thought <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> she had gone through in her own life. According to Lopez, it was easy to be inspired by the melody Judd had written, [...] "and just kind of that grateful feeling, to just be here [...] And keeping it simple. Because life can get so crazy and everything. And then you realize, it's all just kinda about the simplicity of being here, and being healthy. And being alive. So that's where the song came from." ...|$|E

500|$|American Life is {{suffused with}} Ahmadzaï's {{characteristic}} production techniques, like stuttering instruments and vocals, oscillating loop tones recalling 1950s Sonar pulses, morphing vocals consisting of grunts and squeals and treatments {{that make the}} music freeze in between rhythms. The producer hoped that using stuttering would become a rage in the future world of recording. He believed that people think it is not natural to skip and stutter the music. But he used it {{to create a new}} groove. With the help of Pro Tools, he froze the audio at any point he wanted to change the rhythm of the tracks. Madonna discussed the recording of the title track stating that Ahmadzaï had encouraged her to rap spontaneously, about all the materialistic objects that she herself had been using and doing. They had an instrumental breakdown in [...] "American Life", where the producer encouraged Madonna to add a rap about her everyday life. [...] "Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> I like'. So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it. So it was totally spontaneous," [...] she added.|$|E
2500|$|The song's message {{recalls that}} of Dylan's September 1965 single [...] "Positively 4th Street", as Harrison {{appears to be}} ending a relationship, {{possibly}} with a lover. The lyrics adopt an accusatory stance from the opening line: [...] "I've got {{a word or two}} to say <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> you do." [...] Author Ian Inglis describes the song as [...] "a withering attack" [...] in which [...] "Harrison's blunt 'I left you far behind' and Dylan's curt 'It's not my problem' [...] could be spoken by the same voice." [...] Harrison also incorporates Dylan-esque surrealism in his reference to [...] "opaque" [...] minds and in the line [...] "the good things that we can have if we close our eyes".|$|E
2500|$|It is, however, {{said that}} Plato once {{disclosed}} this {{knowledge to the}} public in his lecture On the Good (Περὶ τἀγαθοῦ), in which the Good (τὸ ἀγαθόν) is identified with the One (the Unity, τὸ ἕν), the fundamental ontological principle. The content of this lecture has been transmitted by several witnesses. Aristoxenus describes the event in the following words: [...] "Each came expecting to learn something <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are generally considered good for men, such as wealth, good health, physical strength, and altogether a kind of wonderful happiness. But when the mathematical demonstrations came, including numbers, geometrical figures and astronomy, and finally the statement Good is One seemed to them, I imagine, utterly unexpected and strange; hence some belittled the matter, while others rejected it." [...] Simplicius quotes Alexander of Aphrodisias, who states that [...] "according to Plato, the first principles of everything, including the Forms themselves are One and Indefinite Duality (ἡ ἀόριστος δυάς), which he called Large and Small (τὸ μέγα καὶ τὸ μικρόν)", and Simplicius reports as well that [...] "one might also learn this from Speusippus and Xenocrates and the others who were present at Plato's lecture on the Good".|$|E

2500|$|The song [...] "Iron Man" [...] was {{originally}} entitled [...] "Iron Bloke"; upon hearing the main guitar riff {{for the first}} time, Osbourne remarked that it sounded [...] "like a big iron bloke walking around". The title was later changed to [...] "Iron Man" [...] as bassist and lyricist Geezer Butler composed the lyrics. [...] The riff to [...] "Iron Man" [...] is iconic among heavy metal guitarists, with Osbourne declaring in his memoir that [...] "...Tony Iommi {{turned out to be}} one of the greatest heavy rock riff-makers of all time. Whenever we went into the studio we'd challenge him to beat his last riff and he'd come up with something like 'Iron Man' and blow everyone away." [...] Butler wrote the lyrics as the story of a man who time travels into the future and sees the apocalypse. In the process of returning to the present, he is turned into steel by a magnetic field. He is rendered mute, unable verbally to warn people of his time of the impending destruction. His attempts to communicate are ignored and mocked. This causes Iron Man to become angry and have his revenge on mankind, causing the destruction seen in his vision. [...] "Electric Funeral" [...] also contains apocalyptic imagery dealing with nuclear warfare. In The Last Supper concert film, Iommi remembers that at the time with most bands [...] "it was all the 'flowers in your hair' and we wanted to sing and play about the other side of life." [...] In the 1992 documentary Don't Blame Me Osbourne concurs: [...] "It was me and five kids living in a two bedroom house. My father worked nights, my mother worked days, we had no money, we never had a car, we very rarely went on holiday... And suddenly, you know, we hear about 'If you're going to San Francisco be sure to wear a flower in your hair'. And we're thinking, (contemptuously) 'What the fuck is San Francisco? Where is this? What's all this flower shit? I've got no shoes on my feet. [...] "You could just see that a lot of things were going wrong in the world," [...] Butler recalled to Classic Albums in 2010, [...] "and no one was saying anything about it. Bob Dylan had long since faded from the present memory and there was nobody talkin' <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> I wanted to talk about political stuff so that's what inspired me." ...|$|E
