40|$|Effective {{cross-functional}} {{partnerships between}} sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> functions are {{a priority for}} many organisations. Previous research proposes that organisational structure and/or location may be influential in creating greater collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing.</b> It {{has been suggested that}} high performing organisations may structure their sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> functions as single departments. This study tests both these propositions through a survey of managing directors and CEOs of large UK organisations. The results indicate that there is no relationship between structure or location of sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing.</b> Further, high performing organisations structure their sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> functions both as separate departments and as single departments...|$|R

40|$|Extending {{the view}} espoused by Peter Drucker that {{innovation}} <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> are key functions determining business success, we propose that building superior brand performance requires not only innovation capability <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> capability as key business processes, but also innovation orientation <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> orientation, which provides guidance and co-align with these business processes.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} antecedents and {{consequences}} of collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing.</b> The results suggest that collaborative sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> functions have benefits for the organisation in terms of improved business performance. In addition, improvements in collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> will positively affect <b>marketing</b> orientation <b>and</b> leading to superior marketing quality. The research began with {{an exploration of the}} interface between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> through the available literature. The existing research conceptualises the relationship between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> highlights the benefits of interfunctional collaborative behaviour. Therefore, a study was designed to not only identify the antecedents of collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> so that the relationship between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> can be assessed and improved to the benefit of the organisation, but also to establish that business performance can be directly influenced by improvements in collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing.</b> The research was undertaken through a mixed methodology, utilising exploratory case studies, a large-scale quantitative survey and confirmatory interviews. The data analysis involved four distinct analytical methods: within-case analysis, crosscase analysis, statistical analysis and confirmatory interviews. The large-scale survey was undertaken through a questionnaire that was sent to the Managing Directors/Chief Executives of large, UK-based organisations operating in the business-to-business arena. Through the findings from the survey five antecedents to collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> were identified - management attitudes towards co-ordination, conflict of interests, communications, <b>market</b> intelligence <b>and</b> organisational learning - and a revised conceptual framework was developed. The correlation and multiple regression analysis confirmed the weighting of each of the independent variables upon collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> established a number of other relationships between the variables. The second part of the research focused on the consequences of improved collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing.</b> It was found through the survey that collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> may have a positive effect upon business performance. The research also established that marketing orientation was not an antecedent to collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing,</b> but that collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> may have a positive influence on marketing orientation. In addition, it was established that collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> has a positive effect on business performance. This research identifies some of the antecedents of collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> clarifies the benefits of collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> to the organisation.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> {{interface}} <b>and</b> to identify some of the elements that may influence collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> provide a framework demonstrating how these elements may interrelate. Design/methodology/approach – This paper explores the sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> relationship through qualitative research using one-to-one, tripartite interviews with senior executives <b>and</b> sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> managers of three, UK-based business-to-business organizations. Findings – The paper indicates that there are two types of factor that affect collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing.</b> Those that are out of the control of sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> staff – management attitudes to coordination, interdepartmental culture and structure and orientation, and four that are internal to the interface – inter-functional conflict, communications, <b>market</b> intelligence <b>and</b> learning. The paper also identifies that senior managers play a critical role in influencing this interface. Research limitations/implications – Improving collaboration in the sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> interface should be a focus for senior managers. The paper is limited by the number of cases. Practical implications – The factors identified may be used by organizations to improve collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing.</b> Originality/value – The identification of factors that may improve collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing,</b> <b>and</b> provide a conceptual framework for further study. The paper increases the understanding of the sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> interface by identifying two additional factors that may influence the interface – learning <b>and</b> <b>market</b> intelligence, <b>and</b> demonstrates how the various factors may interrelate to create improved collaboration...|$|R
