5|$|Acrocanthosaurus is {{classified}} in the superfamily Allosauroidea within the infraorder Tetanurae. This superfamily is characterized by paired ridges on the nasal and lacrimal bones {{on top of the}} snout <b>and</b> <b>tall</b> neural spines on the neck vertebrae, among other features. It was originally placed in the family Allosauridae with Allosaurus, an arrangement also supported by studies as late as 2000. Most studies have found it {{to be a member of}} the related family Carcharodontosauridae.|$|E

5|$|Despite Hong Kong's {{reputation}} of being intensely urbanised, the territory has tried to promote a green environment, and recent growing public concern has prompted the severe restriction of further land reclamation from Victoria Harbour. Awareness of the environment is growing as Hong Kong suffers from increasing pollution compounded by its geography <b>and</b> <b>tall</b> buildings. Approximately 80% of the city's smog originates {{from other parts of}} the Pearl River Delta.|$|E
5|$|It mostly breeds in acacia and {{tamarisk}} scrub <b>and</b> <b>tall</b> grass, invariably near rivers {{or other}} wetlands. The construction {{and expansion of}} irrigation canals has increased its habitat in Sindh, and helped it extend its range into the Yamuna floodplain and parts of Rajasthan, India. It may breed around rice paddies and other fields, or human habitations, provided that there is enough cover and suitable nesting sites. In winter, it moves away from its main riverine habitat, and into drier thickets characterised by Salvadora and Capparis bushes, but never moves too far from water.|$|E

5|$|The first iron {{production}} {{started in}} the Middle Bronze Age but it took several centuries before iron displaced bronze. Samples of smelted iron from Asmar, Mesopotamia <b>and</b> <b>Tall</b> Chagar Bazaar in northern Syria were made sometime between 3000 and 2700BC. The Hittites established an empire in north-central Anatolia around 1600 BC. They {{appear to be the}} first to understand the production of iron from its ores and regard it highly in their society. The Hittites began to smelt iron between 1500 and 1200BC and the practice spread to the rest of the Near East after their empire fell in 1180BC. The subsequent period is called the Iron Age.|$|E
5|$|The {{first season}} of the American web {{television}} series Jessica Jones, {{which is based on}} the Marvel Comics character of the same name, follows a former superhero who opens her own detective agency after an end to her superhero career at the hands of Kilgrave.

The season was produced by Marvel Television in association with ABC Studios <b>and</b> <b>Tall</b> Girls Productions, with Melissa Rosenberg serving as showrunner.|$|E
5|$|The {{high density}} <b>and</b> <b>tall</b> skyline of Hong Kong's urban area {{is due to}} a lack of {{available}} sprawl space, with the average distance from the harbour front to the steep hills of Hong Kong Island at , much of it reclaimed land. This lack of space causes demand for dense, high-rise offices and housing. Thirty-six of the world's 100 tallest residential buildings are in Hong Kong. More people in Hong Kong live or work above the 14th floor than anywhere else on Earth, making it the world's most vertical city.|$|E

5|$|The {{invasion}} of non-native plants into its habitat {{is a large}} threat to the bog turtles' survival. Although several plants disrupt its ecosystem, the three primary culprits are purple loosestrife, reed canary grass, and reeds, which grow thick <b>and</b> <b>tall</b> and are believed to hinder {{the movement of the}} turtles. Such plants also out-compete the native species in the bog turtle's habitat, thus reducing the amount of food and protection available to the turtles.|$|E
5|$|The serval prefers {{areas with}} cover such as reeds <b>and</b> <b>tall</b> grasses and {{proximity}} to water bodies, such as wetlands and savannahs. It {{is rare in}} northern Africa and the Sahel, but widespread in southern Africa. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) classifies the serval as least concern. It occurs in protected areas across its range, and hunting of servals is either prohibited or regulated in several countries.|$|E

5|$|Voyager 1s first {{images of}} Io {{revealed}} {{a lack of}} impact craters, suggesting a very young surface. Craters are used by geologists to estimate the age of a planetary surface; the number of impact structures increase with {{the age of the}} planetary surface. Instead, Voyager 1 observed a multi-coloured surface, pockmarked with irregular-shaped depressions, which lacked the raised rims characteristic of impact craters. Voyager 1 also observed flow features formed by low-viscosity fluid <b>and</b> <b>tall,</b> isolated mountains that did not resemble terrestrial volcanoes. The surface observed suggested that, just as Peale and colleagues had theorized, Io was heavily modified by volcanism.|$|E
5|$|A brief {{shelling}} of {{the hill}} begins {{the next day at}} dawn. C Company attempts to capture the hill but is repelled by gunfire. Among the first killed is one of the platoon leaders, Second Lieutenant Whyte. During the battle, a squad led by Sergeant Keck hides behind a swell safe from enemy fire to wait for reinforcements. Keck reaches for a grenade but accidentally pulls the pin and dies in the process. Lieutenant Colonel Tall orders the company commander, Captain James Staros, to take the bunker by frontal assault, at whatever cost. Staros refuses <b>and</b> <b>Tall</b> decides to join Staros on the front line to see the situation. The Japanese resistance seems to have lessened, and Tall's opinion of Staros seems to have been sealed. Private Witt, having been assigned punitively as a stretcher bearer, asks to rejoin the company, and is allowed to do so.|$|E
5|$|Lara Croft is {{depicted}} as an athletic and fast woman with brown eyes and reddish-brown hair, frequently kept in a plait or ponytail. The character's classic costume is a turquoise tank top, light brown shorts, calf-high boots, <b>and</b> <b>tall</b> white socks. Accessories include fingerless gloves, a backpack, a utility belt with holsters on either side, and two pistols. The video game sequels introduced new outfits designed for different environments, such as underwater and cold weather. In the later games, Croft wears a crop top, camouflage pants and black or light brown shirts. When exploring, she often carries two pistols, but has used other weaponry throughout the series. She is fluent in several languages.|$|E

5|$|No {{drawings}} or {{paintings of}} Sherwood exist, but contemporary accounts describe her as attractive <b>and</b> <b>tall</b> and possessing {{a sense of}} humor. Sherwood wore trousers instead of a dress while working on her farm. This was unusual for the time, as was her herb growing. The combination of clothing and good looks was said to attract men and upset their wives. Sherwood biographer and advocate Belinda Nash suggests that Sherwood's neighbors may have been jealous of Sherwood, and that the witchcraft tales may have been conjured up {{in an effort to}} remove her from, and subsequently get, her property. Sherwood was a party to at least a dozen lawsuits, in which she had to defend against accusations of witchcraft, or in which she sued her accusers for slander.|$|E
5|$|Norwegian Forest cats have a {{quiet voice}} but can develop a loud voice if kept {{in a house with}} a dog. They are friendly, intelligent, and {{generally}} good with people. The Norwegian Forest cat has a lot of energy and can be very demanding of attention. Those cats that live primarily outdoors become swift and effective hunters, but the breed can also adapt to indoor life. If bought from a registered breeder in the USA, they tend to cost from $550 to $800. The cats usually live to be 14 to 16 years old. As they are heavy-boned <b>and</b> <b>tall,</b> they require more food than most other domestic breeds. Males are considerably heavier and larger-boned than females.|$|E
5|$|Originating {{below the}} fourth pair of gill slits, the {{pectoral}} fins are short, broad, and falcate (sickle-shaped) with pointed tips. The first dorsal fin {{is tall and}} falcate with a distinctively long free rear tip, and is positioned just behind the pectoral fin bases. The second dorsal fin is large <b>and</b> <b>tall</b> without a notably elongated free rear tip, and is positioned over or slightly behind the anal fin. Usually there is no midline ridge between the dorsal fins, and when present the ridge is slight. The caudal peduncle has a deep crescent-shaped notch at the upper caudal fin origin. The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a notch in the trailing margin near the tip.|$|E
