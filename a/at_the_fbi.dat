5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the U.S. was {{planning}} its own actions against bin Laden. Michael Scheuer, {{chief of the}} CIA's bin Laden unit (Alec Station), considered using local Afghans to kidnap bin Laden, then exfiltrate him from Afghanistan in a modified Lockheed C-130 Hercules. Documents recovered from Wadih el-Hage's Nairobi computer suggested a link between bin Laden and the deaths of U.S. troops in Somalia. These were used {{as the foundation for}} the June 1998 New York indictment of bin Laden, although the charges were later dropped. The planned raid was cancelled in May after internecine disputes between officials <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> and the CIA; the hesitation of the National Security Council (NSC) to approve the plan; concerns over the raid's chance of success, and the potential for civilian casualties.|$|E

50|$|Sessions was <b>FBI</b> {{director}} during <b>the</b> controversial 1992 confrontation at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, <b>at</b> which <b>the</b> unarmed Vicky Weaver {{was shot}} dead by an FBI sniper.

Follmer notes that The Lone Gunmen are identifying the woman who took the child and ran over John Doggett (Robert Patrick).

5|$|In 2002, new {{evidence}} concerning {{the murder of}} Luke Doggett came to light.

Although he tried to play the event off as him paying an informant (at which he nearly succeeded), the truth was as Reyes suspected: Follmer was crooked. Once the truth of Luke's fate was revealed, Follmer killed the mobster who had nevertheless threatened blackmail concerning Follmer's bribe acceptance. Follmer's future <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> was left unresolved, although he most likely faced criminal charges for his actions.|$|E
