This type of motion is called electro-pneumatic action.|$|E

5|$|An Italian Canadian butcher named Lupo is {{complaining}} {{about his job}} one day, while cutting meat in his shop. As each new slice falls to the ground, Lupo grows increasingly angry and swears at the meat. He then accidentally cuts off his own thumb, which inexplicably causes his entire body to fall apart. Blood gushes out onto the ground, and the various pieces of Lupo's body collapse into a pile. The screen darkens <b>and</b> <b>closes</b> in on Lupo's severed head, but before the scene can disappear entirely, Lupo's head jumps forward, still alive. It remains on the screen, shouting insults during the credits, and then falls asleep.|$|E
5|$|But {{above all}} Mario Vargas Llosa uses the fictional Urania to {{facilitate}} the novel's attempt at remembering the regime. The novel opens <b>and</b> <b>closes</b> with Urania's story, effectively framing the narrative {{in the terms of}} remembering the past and understanding its legacy in the present. In addition, because of her academic study {{of the history of the}} Trujillo regime, Urania is also confronting the memory of the regime for the country as a whole. This is in keeping with one purpose of the book, which is to ensure that the atrocities of the dictatorship and the dangers of absolute power will be remembered by a new generation.|$|E

5|$|DX arrays {{have been}} made to form hollow {{nanotubes}} 4–20nm in diameter, essentially two-dimensional lattices which curve back upon themselves. These DNA nanotubes are somewhat similar in size and shape to carbon nanotubes, and while they lack the electrical conductance of carbon nanotubes, DNA nanotubes are more easily modified and connected to other structures. One of many schemes for constructing DNA nanotubes uses a lattice of curved DX tiles that curls around itself <b>and</b> <b>closes</b> into a tube. In an alternative method that allows the circumference to be specified in a simple, modular fashion using single-stranded tiles, the rigidity of the tube is an emergent property.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} fifteen years, Michael (Tyler Mane) {{continues}} making masks and not speaking to anyone. Loomis, having continued to treat Michael over the years, attempts {{to move on}} with his life <b>and</b> <b>closes</b> Michael's case.

5|$|Taking a {{page out}} of Chazz Palminteri's A Bronx Tale, Rosenbaum ignored the script during his final scene with Kristin Kreuk {{for the season}} six finale. Here, as Lana is informing Lex that {{she is going to}} leave, Lex walks around her <b>and</b> <b>closes</b> the door to her exit. Rosenbaum was trying to invoke a moment of fright for the {{audience}}. To the actor, he wanted the audience to wonder what Lex was going to do to Lana; it was a moment meant to show just how unpredictable Lex can be.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the third week of development, the embryonic ectoderm forms a thickened strip called the neural plate. By the fourth week of development the neural plate has widened to give a broad cephalic end, a less broad middle part and a narrow caudal end. These swellings represent {{the beginning}}s of the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. Neural crest cells (derived from the ectoderm) populate the lateral edges of the plate at the neural folds. In the fourth week in the neurulation stage the neural plate folds <b>and</b> <b>closes</b> to form the neural tube, bringing together the neural crest cells at the neural crest. The neural crest runs the length of the tube with cranial neural crest cells at the cephalic end and caudal neural crest cells at the tail. Cells detach from the crest and migrate in a craniocaudal (head to tail) wave inside the tube. Cells at the cephalic end give rise to the brain, and cells at the caudal end give rise to the spinal cord.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Ajay Singh Rathod (R. Madhavan), {{a flight}} {{lieutenant}} in the Indian Air Force who is Sonia's fiancé, is killed when his jet, a MiG-21, crashes. The government proclaims that the crash was caused by pilot error <b>and</b> <b>closes</b> the investigation. Knowing that Rathod was an ace pilot, Sonia and her friends do not accept the official explanation. Instead, they claim that he sacrificed his life to save hundreds of other lives {{that would have been}} lost had he ejected from the aircraft and left it to crash into a populous city. They investigate and learn that the crash was due to a corrupt defence minister Shastri (Mohan Agashe), who had signed a contract exchanging cheap and illegal MiG-21 aircraft spare parts for a personal favour. To their surprise, they learn that the key person who was responsible for organizing the deal was Karan's father, Rajnath Singhania (Anupam Kher).|$|E

Dickens is killed by the Bounty Hunter in the subsequent pursuit, unknowingly aided by Mulder and Scully.|$|E

Pericles tries to help Leo, but Thade throws him hard against a wall. Thade takes Leo's gun from him and tries to fire the weapon at Leo. Leo sees that Thade is within the pilot's deck <b>and</b> <b>closes</b> the automatic door, trapping Thade inside. Thade fires the weapon repeatedly at the door but the ricochets create sparks that cause Thade to huddle afraid under a control panel. Leo decides to escape the Planet of the Apes and return to Earth. He gives Pericles to Ari, who promises to look after him. He says goodbye and kisses Ari and Daena. Leo climbs aboard Pericles's undamaged pod and travels back in time through the same electromagnetic storm. Leo crashes in Washington, D.C. on Earth.

However, the Doctor's memories are not enough to sate the creature and Akhaten reappears.

5|$|Each {{episode of}} Degrassi is written {{following}} the same formula {{with two or three}} storylines (Plot A, Plot B and Plot C). The main storyline, A, opens <b>and</b> <b>closes</b> the episode and is usually driven by a single character. Plot B is usually more comedic in tone and sometimes slightly intertwined with the other stories, often moving story arcs forward. Plot C was usually used sporadically in a season-long arc, but is now used in every episode as comedic relief. The problems and issues presented in the episode are not always resolved {{by the end of the}} episode, and are carried over to the next, or create a mini-arc over several episodes. The majority of episodes are named after songs from the 1980s, and since the tenth season, episodes are named after songs from the 1990s to the present, representing the entering of a new decade and a completely different cast from the earlier seasons. For the first nine seasons, Degrassi: The Next Generation had been produced as a weekly half-hour teen comedy-drama series, with each season consisting of between fifteen and twenty-four episodes.|$|E
