5|$|During this period, Poland was {{undergoing}} yet more upheaval: in 1978, John Paul II was elected Pope, providing a national figurehead of world importance; in 1980, the influential movement Solidarność was created, led by Lech Wałęsa; and in 1981, martial law was declared by General Wojciech Jaruzelski. From 1981–89, Lutosławski refused all professional engagements in Poland <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> {{solidarity with the}} artists' boycott. He refused to enter the Culture Ministry to meet any of the ministers, and was careful not be photographed in their company. In 1983, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> support, he sent a recording of the first performance (in Chicago) of the Third Symphony to Gdańsk to be played to strikers in a local church. In 1983, {{he was awarded the}} Solidarity prize, of which Lutosławski was reported to be more proud than any other of his honours.|$|E
5|$|An infant's new tooth {{is celebrated}} with bowls of {{sweetened}} wheat or barley and sweets served after a child's circumcision include baklava and Burma. Christian families in mourning serve a sweet bun known as rahmeh. It is a food eaten in remembrance {{of the dead}} and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> blessing the soul of the deceased person. The Greek Orthodox Church offer a special tray with cooked wheat covered with sugar and candy after a memorial service.|$|E
5|$|Discovering {{that many}} of his satraps and {{military}} governors had misbehaved in his absence, Alexander executed several of them as examples on his way to Susa. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> thanks, he paid off the debts of his soldiers, and announced that he would send over-aged and disabled veterans back to Macedon, led by Craterus. His troops misunderstood his intention and mutinied at the town of Opis. They refused to be sent away and criticized his adoption of Persian customs and dress and the introduction of Persian officers and soldiers into Macedonian units.|$|E

50|$|On 23 March 1984, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{symbolic}} <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> {{reconciliation and}} healing of the divisions {{caused by the}} Civil War, Tsakalotos publicly met and shook hands with his erstwhile adversary, Markos Vafiades, {{the commander of the}} Communist forces.|$|R
5|$|Edward's body lay at Wareham for a {{year before}} being disinterred. Ælfhere {{initiated}} the reinterment, perhaps <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> reconciliation. According {{to the life of}} Oswald, Edward's body was found to be incorrupt when it was disinterred (which was taken as a miraculous sign). The body was taken to the Shaftesbury Abbey, a nunnery with royal connections which had been endowed by King Alfred the Great and where Edward and Æthelred's grandmother Ælfgifu had spent her latter years.|$|E
5|$|Since {{exiting the}} Premier League, Eddie Davies, the then {{owner of the}} club revoked his {{investment}} into the club. This led to published debts of almost £200m and bought the club very close to being wound up over unpaid tax bills owed to HMRC. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> his goodwill and as incentive to sell the club, Davies promised to wipe over £125m of debt owed to him when the club was sold, which wiped {{a significant proportion of}} debt the club owed.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the spring}} of 2013, secret {{meetings}} were conducted between the United States and Cuba in the neutral locations of Canada and Vatican City. The Vatican first became involved in 2013 when Pope Francis advised the U.S. and Cuba to exchange prisoners <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> goodwill. On December 10, 2013, Cuban President Raúl Castro, in a significant public moment, greeted and shook hands with Obama at the Nelson Mandela memorial service in Johannesburg.|$|E
50|$|It is however unique, in that PVB {{is granted}} the {{authority}} to accept government deposits as mandated by law, Republic Act 7169 Section 6, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> grateful <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> the nation’s appreciation for the service of our World War II veterans.|$|R
5000|$|A peace activist {{climbed over}} the {{railings}} into the Houses <b>of</b> Parliament <b>as</b> <b>a</b> symbolic <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> [...] "power to the people". When arrested by police he explained that [...] "This is the people's parliament, and I {{am one of the}} people".|$|R
5000|$|In {{what many}} saw <b>as</b> <b>a</b> rare <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> self-denial, Omar Lotfi Bek abdicated {{the honor of}} the {{historic}} position of the first club president for Englishman, Mitchell Ince, who was an adviser to the finance ministry at the time, to facilitate financial support for the club.|$|R
5|$|The Union Jack {{flown by}} the ship hangs at Jutland in St Mary's Church, Nottingham. It was {{presented}} by Admiral Sir William George Tennant. In December 1993, during a ceremony at Emden, Germany, Flottillenadmiral Otto H. Ciliax of the Federal German Navy presented {{the commanding officer}} of the latest HMS Nottingham with a boat's badge and ensign from the cruiser sunk in 1916, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> goodwill and reconciliation. Admiral Ciliax's grandfather, Otto Ciliax, was the executive officer of U-52; he recovered these items off a lifeboat from the ship while picking up survivors.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} eighth grade, Doby moved {{north to}} Paterson {{at the age}} of 14 to be reunited with his mother; she visited him weekly while he lived with one of her friends. At Paterson Eastside High School, Doby was a multi-sport athlete; as well as playing baseball and basketball, he was a wide receiver in football and lettered in track. After winning a state football championship, the Eastside team was invited to play in Florida, but the promoters would not allow Doby, the only black player on the team, to participate. Consequently, the team voted to forgo the trip <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> support for Doby.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Oppenheimer became {{chairman}} of the influential General Advisory Committee of the newly created United States Atomic Energy Commission. He used that position to lobby for international control of nuclear power to avert nuclear proliferation and a nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union. After provoking the ire of many politicians with his outspoken opinions during the Second Red Scare, he suffered the revocation of his security clearance in a much-publicized hearing in 1954, and was effectively stripped of his direct political influence; he continued to lecture, write and work in physics. Nine years later, President John F. Kennedy awarded (and Lyndon B. Johnson presented) him with the Enrico Fermi Award <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> political rehabilitation.|$|E
5000|$|On 31 December 1660, a {{few months}} after the {{restoration}} of Charles II to the thrones of England and Scotland, King Louis XIV proclaimed Charles' younger brother, James, Duke of York, [...] "Duke of Normandy". This was probably done <b>as</b> <b>a</b> political <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> support for James.|$|R
50|$|In June 1997, {{along with}} the support of the Tibetan Independence Movement, Turani cut one of the five stars from the {{national}} flag of China in front of the United Nations. Turani removed the star <b>as</b> <b>a</b> symbolic <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> his nation's yearning to liberate themselves from Chinese occupation.|$|R
25|$|When Thessaloniki was annexed {{from the}} Ottoman Empire to the Hellenic State in 1912 during the First Balkan War, the tower was {{whitewashed}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> symbolic <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> cleansing, and acquired its present name.

5|$|Witnessing his brother's death, Warwick {{knew the}} battle was lost. He made for the horses {{in an attempt to}} retreat. Edward {{recognised}} his victory was at hand, and—deciding that Warwick was more valuable alive than dead—sent the order and dispatched his guards to bring back the earl alive. Several chroniclers have suggested that the king thought Warwick would again be a valuable ally if persuaded back to the Yorkist cause. Historian Michael Hicks, on the other hand, suggests that Edward wanted to capture the earl for public execution rather than <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> mercy. Regardless of the king's intent, Warwick died in the Lancastrian rout.|$|E
5|$|Although David James {{remained}} as England's starting goalkeeper in a 2–2 draw against Austria {{in the first}} 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification match, Robinson started every subsequent match, keeping six clean sheets in nine competitive appearances, with a further three in seven friendly matches before the tournament. At the World Cup finals in Germany, Robinson was named in England's World Cup squad and was ever-present in England's campaign, keeping clean sheets in {{four out of five}} matches that he played. After the opening World Cup match against Paraguay, when his counterpart Justo Villar was injured seven minutes into the match, Robinson sent Villar his gloves <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> goodwill. England had won the match 1–0. In addition to the clean sheet against Paraguay, he kept one in the group match against Trinidad and Tobago, although he drew criticism for making errors on crosses. Following England's progression from the group stage, he kept a clean sheet against Ecuador in the round of 16. He also kept a clean sheet in the following match, a quarter-final match against Portugal, although Portugal won 3–1 in a penalty shoot-out to eliminate England from the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Darius {{therefore}} began {{raising a}} huge new army {{with which he}} meant to completely subjugate Greece. However, he died before the invasion could begin. The throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I, who quickly resumed the preparations for the invasion of Greece, including building two pontoon bridges across the Hellespont. In 481 BC, Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece asking for earth and water <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> their submission, but making the very deliberate omission of Athens and Sparta (both of whom were at open war with Persia). Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states. A congress of city states met at Corinth in late autumn of 481 BC, and a confederate alliance of Greek city-states was formed (hereafter referred to as 'the Allies'). This was remarkable for the disjointed Greek world, especially {{since many of the}} city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.|$|E
50|$|Martin Juergens from Germany {{claims that}} the Moon has belonged to his family since July 15, 1756, when the Prussian king Frederick the Great {{presented}} it to his ancestor Aul Juergens <b>as</b> <b>a</b> symbolic <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> gratitude for services rendered, and decreed that it should pass to the youngest born son.|$|R

5|$|In March 1865, Irataba and the Mohave {{defeated}} the Chemehuevi after their allies, the Paiutes, killed two Mohave women. The Mohave pushed the Chemehuevi off their traditional territory {{and into the}} California desert, but they soon returned. To avoid fighting a two-front war, Irataba attacked the Chemehuevi first, then {{turned his attention to}} the Paiutes, who were planning an attack on the Mohave farm and granary on the Colorado's Cottonwood Island. During a subsequent battle with the Chemehuevi in October 1865, Irataba was taken prisoner while wearing his major general's uniform. According to a contemporary news report based on second hand accounts from white travelers, the captors feared that killing him would invite repercussions from the soldiers stationed at Fort Mohave, so they instead stripped him naked and sent him home badly beaten. In the Mohave account of the events as told by Chooksa homar, Irataba surrendered in an effort to make peace with the Chemehuevi, and offered his uniform to their chief <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> peace. In 1867, a treaty signed by Irataba and the Chemehuevi leader Pan Coyer restored peaceful relations between the two nations.|$|E
5|$|Under {{pressure}} from Pretoria {{to accept the}} terms, the Rhodesians agreed on 11 December 1974 and followed {{the terms of the}} ceasefire; Rhodesian military actions were temporarily halted and troops were ordered to allow retreating guerrillas to leave unhindered. Vorster withdrew some 2,000 members of the South African Police (SAP) from forward bases in Rhodesia, and by August 1975 had pulled the SAP out of Rhodesia completely. The nationalists used the sudden cessation of security force activity as an opportunity to regroup and re-establish themselves {{both inside and outside the}} country. Guerrilla operations continued: an average of six incidents a day were reported inside Rhodesia over the following months. Far from being seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> potential reconciliation, the ceasefire and release of the nationalist leaders gave the message to the rural population that the security forces had been defeated and that the guerrillas were in the process of emulating FRELIMO's victory in Mozambique. The détente terms led to the Victoria Falls Conference of August 1975, which collapsed after nine-and-a-half hours, each side blaming the other for the break-up.|$|E
5|$|Theoktistos {{continued}} {{the persecution of}} the Paulicians, which had been initiated by Theodora in 843. Many fled to Arab territory, where with Umar al-Aqta's aid they established a state of their own at Tephrike under their leader Karbeas. Theoktistos concluded a truce with the Abbasid Caliphate and arranged an exchange of prisoners that took place on 16 September 845. Nevertheless, in the same year, {{the execution of the}} surviving Byzantine prisoners from the Arab Sack of Amorium in 842 took place in the Abbasid capital, Samarra. After 845, the Arab raids in the east died down for a few years after a winter raid launched by Ahmad al-Bahili, the Abbasid emir of Tarsus, was defeated by the strategos of Cappadocia. They did not recommence until 851, when the new emir of Tarsus, Ali al-Armani, launched summer raids for three successive years, albeit with little apparent impact. The Byzantines responded with a naval expedition in 853 that sacked the port of Damietta in Egypt, while in the next year a Byzantine army invaded Arab lands in Cilicia and sacked Anazarbus. Around 20,000 prisoners were taken, some of whom were executed on Theoktistos' orders after they refused to convert to Christianity, probably <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> retaliation for the Caliphate's execution of the prisoners of Amorium in 845.|$|E
