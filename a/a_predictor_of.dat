5|$|As {{with many}} Korean rural folk traditions, {{the sport is}} {{regarded}} as <b>a</b> <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> future events, specifically harvests. The outcome of a ritualised contest {{between the two sides}} of a village (East and West) was seen as an indicator of the abundance (or otherwise) of that year's rice crop, which would be harvested in the autumn; as a result, juldarigi and similar folk sports are predominant in the rice-growing areas of the South. This is due to the common association in Southeast Asia between dragons (which the ropes of the juldarigi are thought to resemble) and rain; as a result juldarigi or similar tug-of-war ceremonies have also historically been staged during periods of drought. The connection of the two ropes used (with one rope's smaller loop being placed through the other's larger loop) is reminiscent of sexual intercourse, which also gives rise to the sport's association with fecundity.|$|E
5|$|Deficits in {{cognitive}} abilities are {{widely recognized as}} a core feature of schizophrenia. The extent of the cognitive deficits an individual experiences is <b>a</b> <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> how functional an individual will be, the quality of occupational performance, and how successful the individual will be in maintaining treatment. The presence and degree of cognitive dysfunction in individuals with schizophrenia {{has been reported to}} be a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of positive or negative symptoms. The deficits impacting the cognitive function are found in a large number of areas: working memory, long-term memory, verbal declarative memory, semantic processing, episodic memory, attention, learning (particularly verbal learning). Deficits in verbal memory are the most pronounced in individuals with schizophrenia, and are not accounted for by deficit in attention. Verbal memory impairment has been linked to a decreased ability in individuals with schizophrenia to semantically encode (process information relating to meaning), which is cited as a cause for another known deficit in long-term memory. When given a list of words, healthy individuals remember positive words more frequently (known as the Pollyanna principle); however, individuals with schizophrenia tend to remember all words equally regardless of their connotations, suggesting that the experience of anhedonia impairs the semantic encoding of the words. These deficits have been found in individuals before the onset of the illness to some extent. First-degree family members of individuals with schizophrenia and other high-risk individuals also show a degree of deficit {{in cognitive}} abilities, and specifically in working memory.A review of the literature on cognitive deficits in individuals with schizophrenia shows that the deficits may be present in early adolescence, or as early as childhood. The deficits which an individual with schizophrenia presents tend to remain the same over time in most patients, or follow an identifiable course based upon environmental variables.|$|E

40|$|Using {{hierarchical}} {{multiple regression}} analyses, {{the present study}} examined which coping methods (i. e., problem-focused coping, emotion-focused coping, social support, alcohol intake, and drinking to cope) predicted better overall college adjustment (i. e., social adjustment, personal-emotional adjustment, academic adjustment, and attachment adjustment) for bereaved and non-bereaved students. The results indicated that avoidant emotion-focused coping was <b>a</b> negative <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> college adjustment, and social support from friends was <b>a</b> positive <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> college adjustment for both the bereaved and non-bereaved students. For bereaved students, social support from family was also <b>a</b> positive <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> college adjustment. For non-bereaved students, problem-focused coping was <b>a</b> positive <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> college adjustment and drinking to cope was <b>a</b> negative <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> adjustment. Multiple analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) indicated significant group differences between bereaved and non-bereaved students {{in the area of}} personal-emotional adjustment, with bereaved students reporting lower personal-emotional adjustment than their non-bereaved peers. Finally, the data indicated that emotional-closeness to the deceased, avoidant emotion-focused coping, and alcohol intake were significant and positive coping-related <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> grief symptoms for bereaved college students. The contrast between coping related <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> adjustment and grief for bereaved college students is discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|UnrestrictedThis study {{examined}} the unique contributions of social acceptance and popularity in predicting perceived social reputations and perceived dyadic relationships in a cross-sectional sample of 418 sixth and seventh grade students (approximate average age of 12 years). We assessed early adolescents’ social status using peer nominations and measured {{their perceptions of their}} social status, their behavioral reputations, and their friendships from a combination of self-ratings and peer nominations. Social acceptance was <b>a</b> positive <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> perceptions of social acceptance and friendships and <b>a</b> negative <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> perceptions of rejection and victimization. Popularity was <b>a</b> positive <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> perceptions of popularity, rejection, and aggression and <b>a</b> negative <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> perceptions of unpopularity and withdrawal. The results were consistent with the suggestion that social acceptance is related to perceiving facets of reputations and relationships relevant to forming and maintaining friendships, whereas popularity is related to perceiving facets pertinent to gaining social power...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To test a performance-attainment model {{derived from}} the Dualistic Model of Passion [Vallerand et al. (2003). Les passions de l’aˆme: On obsessive and {{harmonious}} passion. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 85, 756 – 767] that posits that both harmonious and obsessive passions are positive <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> deliberate practice that, in turn, is <b>a</b> positive <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> performance. Design: <b>A</b> prospective design {{was used in the}} present study. Methods and results: The basic model was tested in two studies using structural equation modeling. Results from Study 1 with 184 high school basketball players indicated that both harmonious and obsessive passions were positive <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> deliberate practice, which, in turn, was <b>a</b> positive <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> objective performance. The results of Study 2, conducted with 67 synchronized swimming and water-polo athletes conceptually replicated those from Study 1. Furthermore, results differentially linked the two passions to achievement goals and subjective well-being (SWB). Specifically, harmonious passion was <b>a</b> positive <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> mastery goal pursuit and SWB, whereas obsessive passion was <b>a</b> positive <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> mastery, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance goal pursuit and was unrelated to SWB.

25|$|These {{results suggest}} that the four MBTI scales can be {{incorporated}} within the Big Five personality trait constructs, but that the MBTI lacks a measure for emotional stability dimension of the Big Five (though the TDI, discussed above, has addressed that dimension).
