5|$|Taxes in the United States are levied at the federal, state, {{and local}} {{government}} levels. These include taxes on income, payroll, property, sales, imports, estates and gifts, as well as various fees. In 2010 taxes collected by federal, state and municipal governments amounted to 24.8% of GDP. During FY2012, the federal government collected approximately $2.45 trillion in tax revenue, up $147 billion or 6% versus FY2011 revenues of $2.30 trillion. Primary receipt categories included individual income taxes ($1,132B or 47%), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes ($845B or 35%), and corporate taxes ($242B or 10%). Based on CBO estimates, under 2013 tax law the top 1% will be paying the highest <b>average</b> <b>tax</b> rates since 1979, while other income groups will remain at historic lows.|$|E

40|$|Faced with ageing populations many European {{countries}} {{may be tempted}} to attract immigrants. One {{way to do this is}} to offer tax incentives. Since the decision to migrate is a discrete choice it should be <b>average</b> <b>taxes</b> that are important for the migration decision. If, however, the supply of working hours is endogenous it is shown that marginal taxes are also important for the migration decision, even after controlling for <b>average</b> <b>taxes.</b> Hence, countries interested in attracting immigrants can do so even without reducing <b>average</b> <b>taxes</b> by having less progressive tax systems than other countries.

50|$|The {{population}} in Danderyd Municipality {{is among the}} most affluent in the country, having the highest <b>average</b> <b>taxed</b> income per capita.

25|$|In high-income countries, {{the highest}} tax-to-GDP ratio is in Denmark at 47% {{and the lowest}} is in Kuwait at 0.8%, {{reflecting}} low taxes from strong oil revenues. Long-term average performance of tax revenue {{as a share of}} GDP in low-income countries has been largely stagnant, although most have shown some improvement in more recent years. On average, resource-rich countries have made the most progress, rising from 10% in the mid-1990s to around 17% in 2008. Non resource rich countries made some progress, with <b>average</b> <b>tax</b> revenues increasing from 10% to 15% over the same period.|$|E
25|$|Obama {{increased}} {{taxes on}} high-income taxpayers via: a) expiration of the Bush income {{tax cuts for}} the top 1–2% of income earners starting with 2013; and b) payroll tax increases on roughly the top 5% of earners as part of the ACA. This increased the <b>average</b> <b>tax</b> rate paid by the top 1% (incomes above $443,000 in 2015) from 28% in 2012 to 34% in 2013. According to the CBO, after-tax income inequality improved, by lowering the share of after-tax income received by the top 1% from 16.7% in 2007 to 15.1% in 2012 and to 12.4% in 2013.|$|E

40|$|A central {{finding of}} the modern labor market {{literature}} is that labor supply responses tend to be concentrated along the extensive margin (labor force participation) rather than the intensive margin (hours of work). Yet, {{the literature on the}} marginal cost of public funds (MCF) focuses solely on the intensive margin. In this paper we demonstrate {{that it is important to}} incorporate extensive labor supply responses into the analysis. Firstly, MCF becomes a function of <b>average</b> <b>taxes,</b> rather than just marginal taxes. Secondly, participation decisions and thus MCF depend on the magnitude of transfers for those out of work. Our calculations for 23 OECD countries reveal that the MCF becomes substantially higher once the participation e. ect is accounted for.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} of empirical tax research is the identification and calculation of appropriate tax data. While there is consensus that <b>average</b> marginal <b>tax</b> rates are most suitable for studying the effects of tax policy on economic growth, due to data limitations the calculation of marginal tax rates has been limited to the U. S. and the U. K. This paper provides calculations of <b>average</b> marginal <b>tax</b> rates for the four Scandinavian countries using the methodologies of Seater [1982, 1985] and Barro and Sahasakul [1983, 1986]. Then, by pooling the newly calculated tax rates for the Scandinavian countries with {{the data for the}} U. S. and the U. K., we investigate the effects of tax policy shocks on the per capita GDP growth rate. Our results suggest that an increase in <b>average</b> marginal <b>tax</b> rates has a negative impact on economic growth. Employing Additive Mixed Panel Models with penalized splines as estimation approach, we show that changes in tax rates have nonlinear effects.

30|$|We obtain {{estimates}} of effective marginal tax rates using a methodology {{similar to that}} of Mendoza et al. (1994). Our methodology differs from theirs in two respects: First, we attribute a fraction of households’ nonwage income to labor income to be consistent with our estimate of the capital share. Second, we account for tax progressivity by adjusting <b>average</b> income <b>taxes</b> by the ratio of the marginal income <b>tax</b> to the <b>average</b> income <b>tax</b> from an estimated tax function [following Gouveia and Strauss (1994)]. The estimated tax for the Spanish economy in the 1990 s suggests that the marginal income tax is 1.8 times the <b>average</b> income <b>tax,</b> and this is the adjustment factor that we use.

50|$|In a {{proportional}} tax, the {{tax rate}} is fixed and the <b>average</b> <b>tax</b> rate equals this tax rate. In case of tax brackets, commonly used for progressive taxes, the <b>average</b> <b>tax</b> rate increases as taxable income increases through tax brackets, asymptoting to the top tax rate. For example, consider a system with three tax brackets, 10%, 20%, and 30%, where the 10% rate applies to income from $1 to $10,000, the 20% rate applies to income from $10,001 to $20,000, and the 30% rate applies to all income above $20,000. Under this system, someone earning $25,000 would pay $1,000 for the first $10,000 of income (10%); $2,000 for the second $10,000 of income (20%); and $1,500 for the last $5,000 of income (30%).

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the Alternative Minimum Tax on the weighted <b>average</b> marginal <b>tax</b> rates that apply to various components of taxable income. It also considers the impact of several AMT reform proposals on the number of AMT taxpayers, the total revenue collected from the AMT, and the weighted <b>average</b> marginal <b>tax</b> rates that apply to wages, capital income, and deductions such as state and local taxes and charitable gifts. The paper uses the NBER TAXSIM model to project federal personal income tax liabilities as well as AMT liabilities between 2003 and 2013. The AMT has only a modest impact on the <b>average</b> marginal <b>tax</b> rates for most sources of income because some AMT taxpayers face higher marginal tax rates, and others lower tax rates, {{as a result of the}} tax. The projections show that modest increases in the AMT exclusion level have substantial effects on the number of AMT taxpayers, and that indexing the AMT parameters would reduce the number of AMT payers in 2010 by more than sixty percent. These changes would also reduce the AMT's impact on <b>average</b> marginal <b>tax</b> rates. ...|$|R
