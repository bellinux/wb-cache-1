50|$|Construction {{on a new}} {{addition}} to the northeast side of the campus began in April 2012, with a projected <b>open</b> <b>date</b> in <b>time</b> for the 2014 summer semester. Unfortunately, due to weather and issues with the concrete slab used for the ground settlement, the building was not available for use until the spring semester of 2015. The $39 million addition, which stands three stories tall and spans 93,000 square feet, is the largest structural change to the campus since its opening in 1980. The new building, which houses health and sciences classes, {{is part of a}} $68.5 million five year Facilities Master Plan which went into effect in December 2010. The community college will seek for certification with the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design due to its features, which are not limited to self shading windows which will provide natural lighting to 75 percent of the classrooms during the day. In honor of President Margaret Burke Lee and her planned retirement in June 2015 after 30 years of service, the building has been named the Margaret Burke Lee Science and Health Careers Center.|$|R

We prove {{the existence of a}} unique symmetric equilibrium and then show that for sufficiently large externalities, the <b>open</b> <b>auction</b> yields strictly higher expected revenues compared to a sealed bid <b>auction.</b> An <b>open</b> <b>auction</b> reveals to bidders more payoff relevant information than a sealed bid auction and as a consequence, bidders are shown to have a higher willingness to pay in the early rounds of an <b>open</b> <b>auction.</b> The <b>open</b> <b>auction</b> is also shown to be more efficient than the sealed bid auction. ...|$|R
40|$|A federally {{regulated}} <b>open</b> <b>dating</b> {{system on}} food products, {{instead of the}} current somewhat random and non-uniform state mandated system, would most likely benefit today's consumers, retailers, and government agencies. Consumers have indicated a strong desire for open dates; it would enhance their ability to make educated choices about the freshness of the foods they consume. A mandatory/uniform system would also assist retail grocers with stock rotation, so that customers can be provided with the best products available. Finally, federal <b>open</b> <b>dating</b> regulations across state borders would lessen burdens on interstate commerce. The potential benefits of this dating system outweigh the opposing points-of-view. The purpose {{of this research is}} to illustrate and discuss the current practices and regulations regarding <b>open</b> <b>dating</b> of food. Included in this study are the current federal and state regulations. Fifty-nine percent of the states (including the District of Columbia) currently mandate some sort of <b>open</b> <b>dating</b> on food products. The regulations vary on a state-by-state basis from mandatory dating of all perishable foods to <b>open</b> <b>dating</b> on a completely voluntary basis. While most consumers want to see <b>open</b> <b>dates,</b> educating them about what the dates mean is necessary but currently not being done. A major disadvantage of an <b>open</b> <b>dating</b> system is that it may be deceiving if the food is not properly handled, i. e. the date is based on some average storage condition. There are many modes of food deterioration, and most are dependent on a timetemperature interdependence. This research acknowledges that <b>open</b> <b>dating</b> of food is useful as a guide to the end of shelf-life, but its regulated implementation used in conjunction with timetemperature integrators is a more dependable indic [...] ...|$|R

Moreover, we show that more information about the private value and less information about the common value may improve efficiency and revenue. Consequently, our results suggest new arguments in favor of the <b>open</b> <b>auction.</b> <b>Auctions</b> <b>Open</b> information acquisition Asymmetric information...|$|R

We characterize equilibria of two popular mechanisms, a fixed price mechanism and a uniform price auction, and compare the revenues. While in the auction truthful bidding is a dominant strategy, we find that bidders have an incentive to overstate their demand in the fixed price mechanism. For some parameter values this yields the surprising result that the fixed price mechanism outperforms the auction.
