5|$|On 23 August 2013 Anfield {{was listed}} <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>Asset</b> of Community Value by Liverpool City Council. On 11 September, current owner, John W. Henry {{announced}} {{that they had the}} funds to afford the expansion but they are waiting for the City Council to finalize the purchase of houses in the area before they commit to plans to expand the Main Stand and the Anfield Road end of the ground.|$|E
5|$|The ground became dilapidated: a boy {{was killed}} when a wall {{collapsed}} during rioting in the 1980s. When new owners took the club out of administration in 1993, they began a six-year redevelopment programme during which the ground was converted to an all-seater stadium {{to comply with the}} Taylor Report into safety at sports grounds, and all areas apart from the Main Stand were completely rebuilt. The seating capacity of the modern stadium is around 30,000. It has function rooms suitable for business or social events and a club store selling Birmingham City merchandise. A 2004 proposal that the club should sell the ground and move into a multi-purpose City of Birmingham Stadium remains speculative. In 2013, the ground was listed <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>Asset</b> of Community Value under the Localism Act 2011.|$|E
5|$|Ben Kaplan (Alex Lanipekun) {{breaks into}} Meynell's office {{to learn of}} deals between Highland Life and Salma, a Russian bank that {{according}} to Elizabeta Starkova (Paloma Baeza), has connections with the Russian mafia. It is also revealed Highland Life owes Salma £65 billion. It was this reason that earlier in the episode, Denham committed suicide. In order to get Meynell to trust her {{to become part of}} his plan, Ros sleeps with him. Later, Calderwood receives a call from Asa Darlek (Stephen Noonan), Meynell's associate from Salma, and threatens to either have the £65 billion paid back, or he will go public to inform the country the true extent of its debts. Ros presents a third option; have Calderwood announce she will back Highland Life, {{while at the same time}} she will convince Meynell to bet against it. Such a plan would financially ruin Meynell. The next morning however, Darlek realises she is MI5 and threatens to kill her if Calderwood does not back down. Ros fights the gun off and Calderwood goes ahead with her statement. Later, Lucas releases Elizabeta <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>asset.</b> Meanwhile, Jo Portman (Miranda Raison) believes Boscard (Gus Gallagher), her captor from the end of series six, is still alive after seeing several hallucinations of him. Later, Ros puts her mind at rest when she shows Jo photographic evidence Boscard is indeed dead, and it was Jo who killed him.|$|E

25|$|A public {{example of}} this {{struggle}} between different Christian positions in the church has been the 2003 consecration of Gene Robinson, an openly gay man living with a long-term partner. The acceptance/rejection of his consecration is motivated by different views on the understanding of scripture. This struggle has some members concerned that the church may not continue {{its relationship with the}} larger Anglican Church. Others, however, view this pluralism <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>asset,</b> allowing a place for both sides to balance each other.|$|E
25|$|About {{the time}} of the Mexican–American War in 1846, the United States Navy had grown strong and {{numerous}} enough to eliminate the pirate threat in the West Indies. By the 1830s, ships had begun to convert to steam propulsion, so the Age of Sail and the classical idea of pirates in the Caribbean ended. Privateering, similar to piracy, continued <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>asset</b> in war for a few more decades and proved to be of some importance during the naval campaigns of the American Civil War.|$|E

They studied the use of the Moscow Metro to protect civilians, move troops and headquarter military command posts during the Battle of Moscow, and planned the Beijing Subway for both civilian and military use.|$|E

Enraged, Carrie orders a drone strike, even though it would kill Saul. Quinn stops her, however.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 43 states {{provide a}} variety of special {{incentive}} programs that utilize state tax credits. These include Brownfield credits, Film Production credits, Renewable energy credits, Historic Preservation credits and others.

25|$|Strousberg's empire began a {{terminal}} decline during the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71). In 1872, {{he was forced}} into liquidation after a ruinous settlement with the Rumanian government on account of unfulfilled railway contracts. Strousberg was declared bankrupt in 1875 and the Palais was seized <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>asset</b> by his creditors. After standing trial in Russia for alleged fraudulent transactions with a bank in 1876, he was deported and returned to Berlin, dividing his time between London and the castle in Bromberg whilst attempting his social rehabilitation with various projects and writing his memoirs.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, many {{suburban}} areas, {{especially those}} {{not within the}} political boundaries of the city containing the central business area, began to see independence from the central city <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>asset.</b> In some cases, suburbanites saw self-government {{as a means to}} keep out people who could not afford the added suburban property maintenance costs not needed in city living. Federal subsidies for suburban development accelerated this process as did the practice of redlining by banks and other lending institutions. In some cities such as Miami and San Francisco, the main city is much smaller than the surrounding suburban areas, leaving the city proper with {{a small portion of the}} metro area's population and land area.|$|E
25|$|The regime {{permitted}} non-deported Romanian Jews and American charities to send {{humanitarian aid}} into Transnistrian camps, a measure {{it took an}} interest in enforcing in late 1942. Deportations of Jews ceased altogether in October of the same year. A common explanation historians propose for this reassessment of policies is the change in Germany's fortunes on the Eastern Front, with mention that Antonescu was considering using the Jewish population <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>asset</b> in his dealings with the Western Allies. It nevertheless took the regime more than a year to allow more selective Jewish returns from Transnistria, including some 2,000 orphans. After Transnistria's 1944 evacuation, Antonescu himself advocated the creation of new camps in Bessarabia. In conversations with his cabinet, the Conducător angrily maintained that surviving Jews were better off than Romanian soldiers.|$|E
