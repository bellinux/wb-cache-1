40|$|Shot {{blasting}} {{machines are}} widely used for automated surface treatment and finishing of castings. In shot blasting processes the stream of shots is generated and shaped by blasting turbines, making up a kinetic and dynamic system comprising a separating rotor, an <b>adapting</b> <b>sleeve</b> and a propelling rotor provided with blades. The shot blasting performance- i. e. the quality of shot treated surfaces depends on the actual design and operational parameters of the unit whilst the values of relevant parameters {{are associated with the}} geometry of turbine components and the level of its integration with the separator system. The circulation of the blasting medium becomes the integrating factor of the process line, starting from the hopper, through the propeller turbine, casting treatment, separation of contaminated abrasive mixture, to its recycling and reuse. Inferior quality of the abrasive agent (shot) and insufficient purity of the abrasive mixture are responsible for low effectiveness of shot blasting. However, most practitioners fail to fully recognise the importance of proper diagnostics of the shot blasting process in industrial conditions. The wearing of major machine components and of the blasting agent and quality of shot treated surfaces are often misinterpreted, hence the need to take into account all factors involved in the process within the frame of a comprehensive methodology. This paper is an attempt to formulate and apply the available testing methods to the engineering practice in industrial conditions...|$|E

The designers pitched their sketches to Marcos, who was pleased by their designs.|$|R
40|$|In {{children}} technical {{limitations of}} upper oesophageal sphincter manometry have restricted investigation to the pull through technique under sedation. In {{this study we}} have used an <b>adapted</b> <b>sleeve</b> manometric technique for upper oesophageal sphincter monitoring in unsedated children and determined {{the influence of the}} state of arousal on upper oesophageal sphincter pressure. Twenty six children aged 3 to 42 months (median 17. 5 months), who were referred for evaluation of oesophageal motor function, were studied with dual sleeve manometric assemblies which monitored upper and lower oesophageal sphincter pressures simultaneously. Pharyngeal, oesophageal body, and gastric pressures were also monitored with seven perfused side holes. Recordings were made for four hours after a meal and were technically successful in 24 children. The child's state of arousal was scored every 12 th minute as follows: (A) resting, eyes closed, (B) resting, eyes open, (C) moving but comfortable, (D) restless and uncomfortable, (E) crying. In 67 % of the 12 minute samples the children showed good adaptation to the procedure (arousal states A to C). There was a highly significant difference in upper oesophageal sphincter pressure between each of the arousal states (p less than 0. 0001), being lowest in category A at (mean (SD) 18. 1 (10. 3) mmHg and highest in category D 55. 7 (13. 2) mm Hg. Abrupt changes in the state of arousal were associated with equally abrupt changes in upper oesophageal sphincter pressure. The state of arousal of unsedated children has an important influence on upper oesophageal sphincter pressure. It is essential that this factor is controlled for in any studies of upper oesophageal sphincter tone in children. The sleeve technique is capable of monitoring upper oesophageal sphincter motility for prolonged periods in unsedated children...|$|R
5000|$|The {{result was}} a Bristol Mercury-sized engine <b>adapted</b> to the <b>sleeve</b> valve system, the Perseus, and its smaller cousin, the Bristol Aquila. The first {{production}} versions of the Perseus were rated at 580 horsepower (433 kW), {{the same as the}} Mercury model for that year, which shows that the sleeve system was being underexploited. The engine was quickly uprated as improvements were introduced and by 1936 the Perseus was delivering 810 hp (604 kW), eventually topping out at 930 hp (690 kW) in 1939, while the Perseus 100 with an increased capacity of 1,635 cu in (26.8 L), produced [...] at 2,700 rpm at 4,250 ft (1,296 m). This far outperformed even the most developed versions of the Mercury.|$|R
40|$|The cross-fertilization and {{convergence}} between Eastern and Western cultures {{ranks as}} one of the most influential developments of the twentieth century. Surprisingly, few serious efforts have been made to integrate Chinese and Western traditions and styles into the same production and aesthetic space. My performance project, whose background and gestation this dissertation addresses, attempted to do just that. My search for a Chinese source of inspiration ended when Prof. Chi Li of our Department of Ethnomusicology brought to my attention the only surviving collection of early Chinese texts with music: seventeen poems set to music by the celebrated Chinese poet and composer of the Song dynasty, Jiang Kui (ca. 1155 - 1221). My "Prelude" describes Kui's elusive love experiences with two remarkable sisters whose virtuosity on the pipa was a pivotal element in their relationships. With the assistance of Prof. Peter Kazaras (UCLA's Director of Opera) and my advisor, Prof. Winter, we identified three Western arias that could provide both dramatic contrast and continuity: Christoph Willibald Ritter von Gluck's "Divinit√©s du Styx" (Ye Divinities of Styx) from Alceste (1767); Giuseppe Verdi's "Una macchia e qui tuttora" from Macbeth (1847); and Dido's Lament from Henry Purcell's Dido and Aeneas (1688). The blending of these two seemingly disparate styles using the style of Nian bai, a recitative-like delivery used in traditional Chinese Kun qu opera, created a structure that derives its dramatic integrity and strength from these unlikely pairings. Chapter 1 elaborates on "The Chinese Context" of Jiang Kui, while Chapter 2 discusses "The Western Connections" through Gluck, Verdi, and Purcell. Chapter 3 details the extraordinary power and significance of costume, makeup, facial expression, bodily movement, and use of the water <b>sleeve</b> <b>adapted</b> from Kun qu opera. Chapter 4 discusses not only our decision to employ a Chinese instrumental ensemble but the challenges confronted by Prof. Chi Li in orchestrating, arranging, and even composing under the inspiration of historical practices. My "Postlude" reacts to the overwhelmingly positive feedback we received from the premiere by outlining possible next steps in the evolution of this project, including opportunities for presentation in China...|$|R
