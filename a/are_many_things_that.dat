2500|$|In the 6th century, Pseudo-Dionysius {{claims that}} {{a version of}} the omnipotence paradox {{constituted}} the dispute between St. Paul and Elymas the Magician mentioned in Acts 13:8, but it is phrased in terms of a debate {{as to whether or not}} God can [...] "deny himself" [...] ala 2 Tim 2:13. In the 11th century, St. Anselm argues that there <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> God cannot do, but that nonetheless he counts as omnipotent.|$|E
60|$|Professor Thomas {{had been}} at the College a long time, as long as anyone could remember. He was a strange old man, keeping to himself most of the time. There <b>were</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> he disapproved of, but he seldom said what they were.|$|R

[...] "When I entered upon this work, I knew <b>that</b> <b>that</b> there <b>were</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> I should have to endure.

2500|$|The {{relation}} between anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche has been ambiguous. Even though Nietzsche criticized anarchism, his thought proved influential for many thinkers within {{what can be}} characterized as the anarchist movement. As such [...] "here <b>were</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> drew anarchists to Nietzsche: his hatred of the state; his disgust for the mindless social behavior of 'herds'; his anti-Christianity; his distrust of the effect of both the market and the State on cultural production; his desire for an 'übermensch'—that is, for a new human who was to be neither master nor slave".|$|R

6000|$|... 5. A fit end of Christ's coming, is, {{that his}} righteous ones might shine {{as the sun}} in the glory, or kingdom of their father (Matt 13:43). There <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> do hinder the people of God from shining forth as the sun now.|$|E
2500|$|CNN pundit David Gergen {{argued that}} while, in his view, Obama has wrongly apologized for American actions before, {{he did not}} do so here and {{conservative}} criticisms are unfounded. Independent Senator Joseph Lieberman lauded the speech and went on to remark, [...] "Obama is off to a very, very good start in a very difficult time in our nation's history."

50|$|There <b>were</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> the Women’s Movement {{pointed to}} as {{examples}} of their successes. They felt that one success was the establishment of Roe vs. Wade, which gave women {{the right to choose}} abortion as an option. Another success was the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), which was meant as a logical extension to women’s suffrage and even though it has yet to be passed, it has gotten through both the House and the Senate, and remnants of it continue to this day. Another success of the women’s movement could be Title 9, which called for women to have equal opportunities in college sports. Although Title 9 is far from perfect, and conversation continues to this day, it is still considered successful nonetheless.|$|R

60|$|So {{the summer}} wore away, while we lived {{from hand to}} mouth on such scanty fare {{as the two of}} them shot and what we could venture to gather in the unkempt fields near the gates. A winter of famine lurked ahead, and men were goaded near to madness at the thought of clearings made and corn planted in the spring within reach of their hands, as it were, and they might not harvest it. At length, when a {{fortnight}} had passed, and Tom and Ray had gone forth day after day without sight or fresh sign of Indians, the weight lifted from our hearts. There <b>were</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> might yet <b>be</b> planted and come to maturity before the late Kentucky frosts.|$|R
6000|$|... 3. When Christ doth {{come the}} second time, another {{end of his}} coming will be to pure out all things that {{offended}} in this kingdom (Matt 13:41,42).

6000|$|... "My dear boy, {{the people}} who love only once in their lives are really the shallow people. What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity, I call either the {{lethargy}} of custom or their lack of imagination. Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is {{to the life of}} the intellect--simply a confession of failures. Faithfulness! I must analyse it some day.

'Let Israel hope in the Lord, for with him there is mercy,' tender, great, rich, multiplying mercy, mercy that compasseth us about, that goeth with us all the way, and mercy that rejoiceth to overcome every judgment that seeketh our destruction, as we go toward our Father's house and kingdom! ...|$|E
