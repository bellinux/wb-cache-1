5|$|<b>A</b> <b>transitional</b> fossil is any fossilized {{remains of}} a life form that {{exhibits}} traits common to both an ancestral group and its derived descendant group. This is especially important where the descendant group is sharply differentiated by gross anatomy and mode of living from the ancestral group. These fossils serve {{as a reminder that}} taxonomic divisions are human constructs that have been imposed in hindsight on a continuum of variation. Because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, there is usually no way to know exactly how close <b>a</b> <b>transitional</b> fossil is to the point of divergence. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that transitional fossils are direct ancestors of more recent groups, though they are frequently used as models for such ancestors.|$|E

The species had remained <b>a</b> <b>transitional</b> rainforest species while its relatives radiated into dryer regions.|$|E
