Modern analog speech scrambling systems have successfully tackled the issues of security by using new technological methods that have been borrowed from high fidelity digital <b>audio</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> reduction systems, namely MPEG audio. The modern technological method of making speech over analog circuits secure involves digitizing speech and manipulating the digitized speech in the frequency and time domain by using digital encryption methods.

The psycho-acoustical processing of digital audio coupled with digital encryption methods is adequate to make scrambled audio extremely unintelligible under normal telecommunications conditions.

40|$|Conventional perceptual coding {{algorithms}} do {{not normally}} exploit the temporal masking {{property of the}} human auditory system. These algorithms rely only on simultaneous masking models to calculate the masking threshold. This work proposes {{the use of a}} temporal masking model, combined with a simultaneous masking model, in wavelet packet-based audio coding. The result is a reduction in <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> of approximately 25 kbps while preserving the transparent perceptual quality of audio signals, at a sampling rate of 16 kHz. This is achieved by a more accurate calculation of the combined auditory masking threshold. Another proposed approach of calculating the masking threshold accurately is by oversampling in the discrete wavelet transform. Most of the current wavelet based perceptual coders use the critically sampled discrete wavelet transform. The problem with this transform is aliasing, resulting from the down sampling process after each decomposition. This aliasing is cancelled in the decoding process, however the masking threshold calculation is done using aliased wavelet coefficients. Oversampling in the discrete wavelet transform is proposed in this work to avoid aliasing. The results show that by oversampling in the discrete wavelet transform, a reduction in a <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> of up to 16 kbps can be achieved for audio signal, at a sampling rate of 44. 1 kHz.
