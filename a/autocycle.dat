50|$|After the war, {{the demand}} for economic, personal, {{motorised}} transport blossomed. Using Bown's technical expertise in motorcycle manufacture, the company launched the Aberdale <b>Autocycle</b> in March 1947. The <b>autocycle</b> was powered by a 98cc Villiers Junior de Luxe engine. It was a typical machine of the period but included a custom toolkit and a Smiths speedometer placing it in the higher end of the market, certainly compared to their usual high-volume products. One special machine was created, painted with Post Office livery of bright red {{in an attempt to}} gain a contract from the Royal Mail; it looked so good, a limited edition was offered {{as an alternative to the}} traditional black with gold piping. Joseph Levy also toured North America promoting both the <b>autocycle</b> and the company's Gresham Flyer child's tricycle. Less than 2,000 autocycles were eventually produced overall by 1948.|$|E
50|$|They built {{motorcycles}} and pedal cycles from 1903 {{until the}} early 1930s, when the company changed to the manufacture of Girling brakes. The Girling interests were sold to Lucas in 1943 and the company went back to cycle making {{with a range of}} <b>autocycles</b> or lightweight motor cycles. This continued until 1956 by which time some 24,000 had been made.|$|R
5000|$|A more {{innovative}} design {{was known in}} the UK as the Cyclemaster. This had a complete powered rear wheel which was simply substituted for the bicycle rear wheel, which originated from a design by two DKW engineers in Germany. Slightly larger machines, commonly with a [...] engine were known as <b>autocycles.</b> On the other hand, some mopeds, such as the Czech-made Jawa, were derived from motorcycles.|$|R
50|$|Seasonal {{changes in}} weather can create cyclic sediments {{in the form}} of {{alternating}} bands of clay and silt (also known as varves). For example, in a glacial region where sediments are deposited in a lake, coarse sediments that are trapped in ice are released when the ice melts in the summer. This creates paler, coarser silt bands in the lake deposits. In winter, melting is at a minimum, meaning that only fine material is supplied to the lake, causing thin clay layers. Because the cycles are limited to the depositional basin, the lateral extent of the resultant strata are limited. The time period over which <b>autocycles</b> form are usually less than the time periods of allocyclic deposits.|$|R

50|$|Late in 1948, Villiers {{announced}} {{the introduction of}} their 2F engine; Aberdale, like most of their rival manufacturers such as Francis Barnett, began to redesign their cycle to accommodate the new engine showing a prototype at the Earls Court Show in November 1948. However, the new machine never materialised. In 1949 the company was provided with a factory in Llwynypia, Wales under the government's Advanced Factories Scheme. W.A.R.Bown was charged with developing the new production facility consequently delaying the immediate development of the 2F machine. It took until 1950 before a 2F-powered machine came to market as the Bown Auto-roadster again exploiting the Bown marque with the epithets Hand Built and Since 1860. William Bown continued to develop motorcycles for the company releasing the Bown 1F in 1951. Some 3,000 of <b>autocycles</b> were produced.|$|R
40|$|The Lower Permian (Wolfcampian) Hueco Formation in the Dona Ana Mountains of south-central New Mexico {{contains}} a 30 -m-thick, mixed siliciclastic-carbonate succession exposed {{for up to}} 1 km perpendicular to regional paleoslope. The succession was deposited in shallow-marine, wave- and tide-dominated estuarine, and fluvial environments, and is arranged into three fourth-order sequences. The lower two sequence boundaries incise marine fossiliferous packstone and offshore to lower-shoreface mudstone-siltstone and are overlain by fluvial sediment comprising the lowstand systems tract. Fluvial-channel sedimentation above the lower two sequence boundaries changed from vertical to lateral accretion in response to decreasing gradient in the incised valley. The transgressive systems tract of the lower two sequences begins with a tidal ravinement surface, which is mantled locally by a pebble–cobble lag of rip-up clasts and fossils. The tidal ravinement surface cuts channels up to 4 m deep, locally removing transgressive-estuarine and some lowstand-fluvial sediment. Symmetrically rippled sandstone-siltstone deposited {{near the mouth of}} the estuary overlies the tidal ravinement surface and is overlain and locally truncated by a wave ravinement surface. In sequence 2, the highstand systems tract consists of a progradational package of heterolithic mudstone–siltstone–sandstone and bivalve packstone deposited in the central basin of the estuary; and sandstone with wood and bivalves, and carbonaceous mudstone and sandstone deposited in bayhead deltas and marshes. Sequence boundary 3 is characterized by a restricted-marine ostracode packstone sharply overlying a marsh mudstone with a vertic Calcisol and burrows of the Glossifungites Ichnofacies, and was produced on an interfluve. Sequence 3 is not present in the northern exposures, having been removed by erosion associated with sequence boundary 4. The temporal scale (105 yrs) of the fourth-order sequences implies a glacial-eustatic origin. Interbeds of shallow-marine fossiliferous packstone and mudstone–siltstone in {{the lower part of the}} succession resemble fifth-order sequences in the Midcontinent, but also may represent parasequences or <b>autocycles...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{full text}} is not {{available}} on SOAR. Access this article via the commercial databases licensed by University Libraries: [URL] depositional facies architecture, and diagenesis of upper Pliocene to Holocene carbonates in northern Belize are evaluated based on a ca 290 m, continuous section of samples from a well drilled on Ambergris Caye that can be linked directly to outcrops of Pleistocene limestone, and of overlying Holocene sediments. Upper Pliocene outer-ramp deposits are overlain unconformably by Pleistocene and Holocene reef-rimmed platforms devoid of lowstand siliciclastics. Tectonism controlled {{the location of the}} oldest Pleistocene platform margin and coralgal barrier reef, and periodically affected deposition in the Holocene. A shallow, flat-topped, mostly aggradational platform was maintained in the Holocene by alternating periods of highstand barrier-reef growth and lowstand karstification, differential subsidence, and the low magnitude of accommodation space increases during highstands. Facies in Pleistocene rocks to the lee of the barrier reef include: (i) outer-shelf coralgal sands with scattered coral patch reefs; (ii) a shoal–water transition zone comprising nearshore skeletal and oolitic sands amidst scattered islands and tidal flats; and (iii) micritic innershelf deposits. Four glacio-eustatically forced sequences are recognized in the Pleistocene section, and component subtidal cycles probably include forced cycles and <b>autocycles.</b> Excluding oolites, Holocene facies are similar to those in the Pleistocene and include mud-mounds, foraminiferal sand shoals in the inner shelf, and within the interiors of Ambergris and surrounding cayes, mangrove swamps, shallow lagoons, and tidal and sea-marginal flats. Meteoric diagenesis of Pliocene and Pleistocene rocks is indicated by variable degrees of mineralogic stabilization, generally depleted whole-rock d 18 O and d 13 C values, and meniscus and whisker-crystal cements. Differences in the mineralogy and geochemistry of the Pliocene and Pleistocene rocks are attributed to variable extent of meteoric alteration. Dolomitization in the Pliocene carbonates may have begun syndepositionally and continued into the marine shallow-burial environment. Positive dolomite d 18 O and d 13 C values suggest precipitation from circulating, near-normal marine fluids that probably were modified somewhat by methanogenesis. Sedimentologic and diagenetic attributes of the Pliocene–Pleistocene rocks in the study area are similar to those in the Bahamas with which they share a common history of sea-level fluctuations and climate change...|$|R

Virginia defines an <b>autocycle</b> as [...] "a three-wheeled motor vehicle that has a steering wheel and seating that {{does not require the}} operator to straddle or sit astride and is manufactured to comply with federal safety requirements for motorcycles." [...] Indiana defines it as [...] "a three (3) wheeled motor vehicle in which the operator and passenger ride in a completely or partially enclosed seating area that is equipped with:(1) a rollcage or roll hoops; (2) safety belts for each occupant; and (3) antilock brakes;and is designed to be controlled with a steering wheel and pedals." [...] In other jurisdictions, such as British Columbia, Canada, and Connecticut, a three-wheeled vehicle with an enclosed passenger compartment or partially enclosed seat is considered an automobile.|$|E
