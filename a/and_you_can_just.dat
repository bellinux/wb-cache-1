40|$|This {{project is}} about the {{implementation}} of the Danish government’s policy “Bedre Balance (translated: Better Balance) ”. The policy is about relocating governmental workplaces. In this project, we wish to investigate the barriers that the policy will encounter in the implementation process as regard to the relocation of governmental workplaces. Concretely this policy contain witch governmental agencies that will be relocated. In total, {{the government is going to}} relocate 3. 899 governmental jobs from the capital to other part of the country, in order to get “Denmark in better balance”. The main purpose of this project is to falsify or verify our assumptions concerning the barriers that this policy may encounter in the implementation process. Based on our assumptions, we have two hypotheses in relation to whether there is a need for employee involvement in the implementation <b>and</b> whether <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> tear the employees uprooted. The project's theory of science direction is critical realism. Science theory will helps us keep a thread throughout the project and therefore has influence on the theory and methodology we have chosen to use. The theoretical basis for the project is the two Danish theorists Søren Winter and Vibeke Lehmann Nielsen's theory of implementation. Winter and Nielsen's theory allows us to analyze the policy, but also the employees behavior. The empirical basis on previous relocations of Danish government workplaces is limited to a single evaluation made by Klaus Lindegaard from University of Southern Denmark. In this report, Lindegaard evaluate three different cases of relocating governmental jobs. We in this project have chosen to analyze the three cases individually and supplement this with the Norwegian experiences of relocating workplaces. Furthermore, we include articles from magazines and newspapers, to involve employees' views on the relocation. The analysis will result in an transverse summarize, where we assess whether our hypotheses have been weakened, strengthened or are to be considered neutral. The result of the transverse summary of the analysis is then the subject of for an discussion. This discussion will sum on the project and discuss the results...|$|R
