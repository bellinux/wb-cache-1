5|$|Asch {{found that}} some 1/4 of all {{subjects}} successfully withstands this form of social pressure, 1//20 completely succumbs, while the remainder conforms to the majority's manifestly incorrect opinion only in some experimental rounds. Asch suggested that this procedure created a doubt in the participants' mind about the seemingly obvious answer. Participants reported that the correct but rejected line was almost but not quite equal to the standard line. Asch {{also found that the}} effectiveness of the group pressure increased significantly from 1 person to 3 people unanimously responding incorrectly. However, there was not much increase <b>after</b> <b>that.</b> <b>He</b> also found that when one confederate responded correctly, the power of the majority to influence the subject decreased substantially.|$|E

In 1984, Removing All Doubt was staged for drama students at his alma mater, Syracuse University. <b>After</b> <b>that,</b> <b>he</b> wrote Hidden in This Picture which debuted off-off-Broadway at Steve Olsen's West Bank Cafe Downstairs Theatre Bar in New York City in 1988.

He testified against the test ban both before Congress as well as on television.|$|E

5|$|After {{forfeiting}} {{his title}} as World Champion, Fischer became reclusive and sometimes erratic, disappearing from both competitive chess {{and the public}} eye. In 1992, he reemerged to win an unofficial rematch against Spassky. It was held in Yugoslavia, which was under a United Nations embargo at the time. His participation led to a conflict with the U.S. government, which sought income tax on Fischer's match winnings, and ultimately issued a warrant for his arrest. <b>After</b> <b>that,</b> <b>he</b> lived his life as an émigré. In 2004, {{he was arrested in}} Japan and held for several months for using a passport that had been revoked by the U.S. government.

5|$|Andy assembles three applicants: a {{bodybuilder}} from Oscar Martinez's (Oscar Nunez) gym, Dwight's building handyman Nate (Mark Proksch), and a PhD {{candidate who}} can only work {{two days a}} week. Darryl demands anew to be fired, then switches gears: he tells Andy {{to give him the}} manager job, saying he deserves it and wants that or a pink slip. Andy then steps up and bluntly tells Darryl he not only {{is not going to do}} that, but Darryl was not even the runner-up to Andy in the selection process. As he brings up Darryl's short temper, his hiring of the unqualified Glenn, and his loss of interest in taking business education courses, Darryl finally snaps out of his funk and listens to him. Andy tells Darryl that Jo Bennett loved him and saw something in him, and he simply stopped striving <b>after</b> <b>that.</b> <b>He</b> convinces Darryl to stay on board, and Darryl says he will assemble a new warehouse staff using a combination of his picks and one or two of Andy's applicants.|$|E
5|$|Another {{range of}} {{extensions}} came {{in relation to}} what could be copyrighted. The Statute only referred to books, and being an Act of Parliament, {{it was necessary to}} pass further legislation to include various other types of intellectual property. The Engraving Copyright Act 1734 extended copyright to cover engravings, statutes in 1789 and 1792 involved cloth, sculptures were copyrighted in 1814 and the performance of plays and music were covered by copyright in 1833 and 1842 respectively. The length of copyright was also altered; the Copyright Act 1814 set a copyright term of either 28 years, or the natural life of the author if this was longer. Despite these expansions, some still felt copyright was not a strong enough regime. In 1837, Thomas Noon Talfourd introduced a bill into Parliament to expand the scope of copyright. A friend of many men of letters, Talfourd aimed to provide adequate rewards for authors and artists. He campaigned for copyright to exist {{for the life of the}} author, with an additional 60 years <b>after</b> <b>that.</b> <b>He</b> also proposed that existing statutes be codified under the bill, so that the case law that had arisen around the Statute of Anne was clarified.|$|E

5|$|Calvin {{produced}} {{commentaries on}} most of the books of the Bible. His first commentary on Romans was published in 1540, and he planned to write commentaries on the entire New Testament. Six years passed before he wrote his second, a commentary on First Epistle to the Corinthians, but <b>after</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> devoted more attention to reaching his goal. Within four years he had published commentaries on all the Pauline epistles, and he also revised the commentary on Romans. He then {{turned his attention to the}} general epistles, dedicating them to Edward VI of England. By 1555 he had completed his work on the New Testament, finishing with the Acts and the Gospels (he omitted only the brief second and third Epistles of John and the Book of Revelation). For the Old Testament, he wrote commentaries on Isaiah, the books of the Pentateuch, the Psalms, and Joshua. The material for the commentaries often originated from lectures to students and ministers that he reworked for publication. From 1557 onwards, he could not find the time to continue this method, and he gave permission for his lectures to be published from stenographers' notes. These Praelectiones covered the minor prophets, Daniel, Jeremiah, Lamentations, and part of Ezekiel.|$|E
5|$|Evan Lysacek was {{originally}} coached by Candice Brown in Naperville. <b>After</b> <b>that,</b> <b>he</b> worked with Deborah Stoery in Naperville, Illinois and Addison, Illinois for three years. For {{the next two}} years, he had an arrangement where he would train under both Addison-based Maria Jeżak-Athey and Moscow-based Viktor Kudriavtsev. Kudriavtsev would come to Chicago {{for part of the}} year to coach, and Lysacek spent his summers at Kudriavtsev's summer training camps in Moscow, Russia and Flims, Switzerland. When that arrangement proved untenable, Kudriavtsev recommended Lysacek to Carroll, who agreed to coach Lysacek on the condition that Lysacek would work more with Congemi than with himself, due to Carroll's commitments to Timothy Goebel. Lysacek moved to El Segundo, California to work with Frank Carroll and Ken Congemi in June 2003. Lysacek worked with both Congemi and Carroll through the 2006-2007 season, after which he began working solely with Carroll. He has also trained with ballerina Galina Barinova.|$|E
5|$|He {{grew up in}} the Uranienborg {{neighbourhood}} in the West End of Oslo, {{and enrolled}} at the Royal Frederick University in 1933.

From 1940 to 1945, during the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, he was employed at the Norwegian general consulate in New York City. He worked as a foreign affairs journalist for the conservative newspaper Aftenposten from 1946 to 1948 and for the Norwegian News Agency from 1949 to 1953.
