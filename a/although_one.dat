5|$|A small insectivorous bird, it {{is subject}} to {{predation}} by mammals, such as cats and mustelids, and birds, particularly hawks of the genus Accipiter. Its large range and population mean that its status is secure, <b>although</b> <b>one</b> subspecies is probably extinct.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>one</b> {{might expect}} stylets to be fossilized {{since they are}} made of the mineral calcium phosphate, none have been found. As nemertea are {{otherwise}} completely soft-bodied, one would expect fossils {{of them to be}} extremely rare.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>one</b> of {{the more}} fantastic {{elements}} of science fiction {{is central to the}} film, Carruth's goal was to portray scientific discovery in a down-to-earth and realistic manner. He notes that many of the greatest breakthrough scientific discoveries in history have occurred by accident, in locations no more glamorous than Aaron's garage.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{have been}} mostly positive, <b>although</b> <b>one</b> initial poor review by Jan Moir {{was picked up}} by the {{mainstream}} media. The concept of the cool boxes was also praised. It was Ramsay's first airport-based restaurant, and in 2013 he announced that he was planning to take the concept to a number of airports within the United States.|$|E

5|$|The La Reforma {{volcanic}} rocks feature an anomalous chemistry {{resembling the}} calc-alkaline magma series, even though La Reforma {{is not a}} subduction zone volcano. This {{is consistent with the}} geochemistry of nearby Tres Virgenes, <b>although</b> <b>one</b> pyroclastic flow at La Reforma was considered peralkaline.|$|E

5|$|The {{axillary}} arch {{is considered}} to have no functional significance, <b>although</b> <b>one</b> small study of 22 participants has reported an increase in strength, endurance and motor control of the arm in women (but not men) with the arch as compared with those without; and an improvement in shoulder proprioception in both men and women.|$|E
5|$|The monarch flycatchers are {{a diverse}} family of around 140 species of {{passerine}} birds found from Africa to Australia. Closely {{related to the}} drongo family Dicruridae, they are sometimes classified as a subfamily within it. Monarchs generally live in the canopy or understory in forest habitats, <b>although</b> <b>one</b> species is ground-dwelling. One species is found in Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} pintail {{is a popular}} species for game shooting because of its speed, agility, and excellent eating qualities, and is hunted across its range. <b>Although</b> <b>one</b> of the world's most numerous ducks, the combination of hunting with other factors has led to population declines, and local restrictions on hunting have been introduced at times to help conserve numbers.|$|E

5|$|The swifts {{are small}} birds which spend the {{majority}} of their lives flying. These birds have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang. Two species have been recorded in North Carolina, <b>although</b> <b>one</b> was only identified to genus.|$|E
5|$|The three Canadian {{ships were}} used to {{transport}} troops back to Canada {{after the end of}} the war before being broken up in 1947. Most of the British ships were broken up around the same time, <b>although</b> <b>one</b> ship was sold to the Dominican Navy in 1949 and served until 1968.|$|E
5|$|There are 54 {{cyclically}} ordered {{combinations of}} such angles that {{add up to}} 360 degrees at a vertex, but {{the rules of the}} tiling allow only seven of these combinations to appear (<b>although</b> <b>one</b> of these arises in two ways).|$|E

5|$|A 2009 {{consensus}} {{from the}} studies of {{the introduction of the}} euro concluded that it has increased trade within the eurozone by 5% to 10%, <b>although</b> <b>one</b> study suggested an increase of only 3% while another estimated 9 to 14%. However, a meta-analysis of all available studies suggests that the prevalence of positive estimates is caused by publication bias and that the underlying effect may be negligible. Furthermore, studies accounting for time trend reflecting general cohesion policies in Europe that started before, and continue after implementing the common currency find no effect on trade. These results suggest that other policies aimed at European integration might be the source of observed increase in trade.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 23 {{different}} players {{were used by}} Nelson during their 44 competitive matches, {{less than half of}} whom had played for the club in previous campaigns. Goalkeeper Harry Abbott and half-back Ernie Braidwood were the two ever-presents for Nelson during 1924–25. Centre forward Joe Eddleston scored 26 goals in 43 games to become the team's top goalscorer for the fourth consecutive season. Two Nelson records were set during the campaign, <b>although</b> <b>one</b> was later broken; the seven-goal winning margin against Crewe Alexandra was never bettered in Football League matches, while the attendance of 13,500 for the visit of Darlington in April 1925 was the largest ever seen at Seedhill at that time.|$|E

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>one</b> bomb did detonate, Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) {{views the}} {{operation}} a success, {{as the other}} three did not, and no civilians were killed. Ben tells Lucas he was right about Jawad; he chose to become a bomber over seeing his family. Lucas receives a call from Marlin, who asks to meet with him. During the confrontation, Marlin admits {{he was forced to}} become Mr. Big when terrorists kidnapped his family. Now knowing he has failed, he commits suicide.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>one</b> of the plaintiffs' witnesses, a {{chartered}} land surveyor, {{had suggested}} that the authorities could redevelop the land in a different manner, he did not state that the authorities' redevelopment plan was wrong or indefensible. The court {{was not in a}} position to decide which plans for redeveloping areas in Singapore were better. Thus, the acquisition of the temple property had not infringed Article 12(1) of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Among other pursuits, amateur dramatics {{flourish}} (even though Brasenose was an all-male college). Overall, {{the intake}} and careers of undergraduates remained {{dominated by the}} Church (up to half), drawn {{from a range of}} backgrounds. The college remained largely independent of the large public schools. Brasenose's academic record remained solid, if unremarkable; its strengths lay in classics, <b>although</b> <b>one</b> of its most prominent academics– Arthur Evans– studied modern history.|$|E
