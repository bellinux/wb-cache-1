5|$|The {{establishment}} of King's College Hospital Dental School was proposed by Viscount Hambleden at a Hospital Management Committee meeting on 12 April 1923. The dental school was opened on 12 November 1923 in King’s College Hospital. Under the 1948 National Health Act, King's Medical <b>and</b> <b>Dental</b> School split from King's {{and became an}} independent school, but the school remerged with King's in 1983. The school further merged with the United Medical <b>and</b> <b>Dental</b> Schools of Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospitals in 1998.|$|E

5|$|Because {{titanium}} is biocompatible (non-toxic and not {{rejected by}} the body), it has many medical uses, including surgical implements and implants, such as hip balls and sockets (joint replacement) <b>and</b> <b>dental</b> implants that can stay in place for up to 20 years. The titanium is often alloyed with about 4% aluminium or 6% Al and 4% vanadium.|$|E

Such sources do not need extensive radiation protection – only a small cup of lead.|$|E

5|$|Methamphetamine users {{sometimes}} experience soreness in {{the joint}} of the jaw <b>and</b> <b>dental</b> attrition (tooth wear), owing to bruxism (grinding of the teeth) caused by the drug. This bruxism can occur continuously. Chronic use of the drug might also cause trismus, the inability to open the jaw. Long-term users often experience xerostomia (dry mouth).|$|E
5|$|Oral hygiene is the {{practice}} of keeping the mouth clean and {{is a means of}} preventing dental caries, gingivitis, periodontal disease, bad breath, and other dental disorders. It consists of both professional and personal care. Regular cleanings, usually done by dentists <b>and</b> <b>dental</b> hygienists, remove tartar (mineralized plaque) that may develop even with careful brushing and flossing. Professional cleaning includes tooth scaling, using various instruments or devices to loosen and remove deposits from teeth.|$|E

Dental fracture and wear affects 14% to 41% of subjects with lip and/or intra-oral ornaments.|$|E

Depression has also been linked with rumination syndrome, though its effects on rumination syndrome are unknown.|$|E

5|$|Horses require routine {{hoof care}} from a farrier, {{as well as}} vaccinations to protect against various diseases, <b>and</b> <b>dental</b> {{examinations}} from a veterinarian or a specialized equine dentist. If horses are kept inside in a barn, they require regular daily exercise for their physical health and mental well-being. When turned outside, they require well-maintained, sturdy fences to be safely contained. Regular grooming {{is also helpful to}} help the horse maintain good health of the hair coat and underlying skin.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, St Thomas's Hospital Medical School {{was granted}} its own {{coat of arms}}. However, the St Thomas' Hospital coat of arms has still been used. Guy’s Medical School {{proposed}} to apply for its own coat of arms after separating from Guy’s Hospital, yet the school decided to continue to use Guy's Hospital’s arms in 1954. The two medical schools merged in 1982 and became the United Medical <b>and</b> <b>Dental</b> Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals (UMDS). Simon Argles, secretary of UMDS, said {{that because of the}} name of the medical school it was more appropriate to use the hospital's coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|Motor {{transport}} units were also formed. Not required at Gallipoli, {{they were sent}} on to the Western Front, becoming the first units of the AIF to serve there. The motor transport rejoined I ANZAC Corps when it reached the Western Front in 1916. Australia also formed six railway operating companies, which served on the Western Front. Specialist ordnance units included ammunition and mobile workshops units formed late in the war, while service units included supply columns, ammunition sub-parks, field bakeries and butcheries, and depot units. Hospitals and other specialist medical <b>and</b> <b>dental</b> units were also formed in Australia and overseas, as {{were a number of}} convalescent depots.|$|E
