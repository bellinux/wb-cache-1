5|$|One {{objection}} is that two-level utilitarianism undermines an agent's {{commitment to}} act in accordance {{with his or her}} moral principles. For example, a theist will comply with his/her moral code because he/she sees it as based upon God's will. However, a two-level utilitarian knows that his everyday set of moral rules is merely <b>a</b> <b>guideline,</b> and as such any breach of these rules is unlikely to accompany the same degree of guilt as would someone who believed that it was wrong in principle {{to act in}} that way.|$|E
5|$|The book {{presents}} {{case histories}} {{of all the}} twin-pairs studied and the raw data from the analyses. Its last chapters put the results {{in the context of}} existing studies, and presented a new theory and model to explain the causes and continuance of the disorder. The environmental aspects the researchers checked drew on existing literature, and multiple judgments were pooled to both compare and mutually cancel differing criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia. The theory in the book was that many genes work together to dispose a person to the disorder under certain environmental pressures. The model provided no specific therapeutic insight, but was useful as <b>a</b> <b>guideline</b> for further study.|$|E

40|$|The {{guidance}} and control software (GCS) experiment {{is an effort}} to generate realistic software failure data by developing three implementations of a {{guidance and}} control software application according to the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics RTCA/DO- 178 <b>A</b> <b>guidelines.</b> The authors describe their approach for evaluating the DO- 178 <b>A</b> <b>guidelines</b> and give results from the development and verification process for the Pluto implementation.

40|$|The {{application}} of industry standards {{to the development}} of avionics software is discussed, focusing on verification and validation activities. It is pointed out that the procedures that guide the avionics software development and testing process are under increased scrutiny. The DO- 178 <b>A</b> <b>guidelines,</b> Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification, are used by the FAA for certifying avionics software. To investigate the effectiveness of the DO- 178 <b>A</b> <b>guidelines</b> for improving the quality of avionics software, guidance and control software (GCS) is being developed according to the DO- 178 A development method. It is noted that, due to the extent of the data collection and configuration management procedures, any phase in the life cycle of a GCS implementation can be reconstructed. Hence, a fundamental development and testing platform has been established that is suitable for investigating the adequacy of various software development processes. In particular, the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the development method recommended by the DO- 178 <b>A</b> <b>guidelines</b> are being closely examined...|$|R

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>guideline</b> for the {{appropriate}} amount of fat—a component of daily food consumption—is established by regulatory agencies like the Food and Drug Administration.

25|$|Under some {{circumstances}} a guide {{line can be}} used as a reference for the divers to find the hole after the dive or in an emergency in a similar way to cave diving or wreck penetration instead of a lifeline. In these cases the divers should be competent in procedures for diving with <b>a</b> <b>guideline.</b>|$|E
25|$|Silt screws {{are short}} lengths of rigid tube (usually plastic) with one {{sharpened}} end and a notch or slot {{at the other}} end to secure the line, which are pushed into the silt or detritus of the cave floor as a place to tie off <b>a</b> <b>guideline</b> when no suitable natural tie-off points are available.|$|E

25|$|Infants {{follow a}} general {{timeline}} of vocal developments in childhood. This timeline provides a general outline of expected developments {{from birth to}} age one.

However, individual children can show large variability and this timeline is only <b>a</b> <b>guideline.</b>|$|E
25|$|West Edmonton Mall {{first opened}} its doors to the public on 15 September 1981. The mall was {{developed}} in four phases, completed in 1981, 1983, 1985 and 1999. It was the largest indoor shopping centre in the world until 2004, and was named such in the Guinness Book of Records.

25|$|The {{ability to}} {{navigate}} in total darkness using the guideline {{to find the}} way out is a safety critical emergency skill. Line management skills required for cave diving include laying and recovering guide lines using a reel, tie-offs, {{the use of a}} jump line to cross gaps or find a lost guide line in silted out conditions, identifying the direction along the guideline leading to the exit, and the skills of dealing with a break in <b>a</b> <b>guideline.</b>|$|E

Packaging materials containing the food processed by irradiation must also undergo approval. Food irradiation in the United States is primarily regulated by the FDA since it is considered a food additive. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) amends these rules for use with meat, poultry, and fresh fruit.|$|E

It is believed that tying repayment to energy bills will give investors a secure return.|$|E
