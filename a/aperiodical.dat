Adopting a periodical training scheme with a given bandwidth efficiency, a trade-off between investing pilots for good initialization and training the algorithm exclusively leads to the lowest BER. We also introduce a training on request scheme, in order to overcome the error propagation encountered by the Kalman filter after a series of detection errors. For this purpose, two metrics to detect the Kalman filter divergence are developed.

The feedback information, however, consumes the uplink bandwidth and thus generates overhead.

The perturbation to the shock was phenomenologically treated assuming this as the consequence of the shock refraction.

The first challenge for describing transport in <b>aperiodical</b> time dependent flows is obtaining a representation of the phase portrait where the most relevant dynamical features may be identified. This representation is accomplished by using global Lagrangian descriptors that when applied for instance to the altimeter data sets retrieve over the ocean surface a phase portrait where the geometry of interconnected dynamical systems is visible. The phase portrait picture is essential because it evinces which transport routes are acting on the whole flow.

Method: A 72 -sample database of vocal gestures accompanying different acoustical events comprised highspeed cinematographic, audio, and electroglottographic recordings of 5 subjects. Combining the physiological correlates with a theoretical model of phonation, the vocal-ventricular aerodynamic interactions were investigated. Results: A ventricular-fold motion is found during (de) crescendos, shout, throat singing, yodel, growls, and glides with transitions between registers. Three main types of dynamics are identified: slow nonoscillatory motion and fast oscillatory motion with <b>aperiodical</b> or periodical vibrations. These patterns accompany a change in voice quality, pitch, and/or intensity. Alterations of glottal-oscillatory amplitude, frequency, and contact were predicted. It is shown that a ventricular oscillation can be initiated and sustained by aerodynamic coupling with the vocal folds.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of the temporal behaviour of a plasma at several time varying conditions is of great interest under general physical aspects {{as well as from}} the point of view of very different applications. After an short survey concerning the investigations related to such problems in the following we discuss some more comprehensive results which were recently obtained in the investigations of the electron ensemble both at the field free collision dominated relaxation in the afterglow during the first period of temporal decay and at the collision dominated relaxation in a plasma with additional heating by an electric field. These studies take into account all main collision processes using realistic functions for the energy dependence of the correlated collision cross sections. The results were attained by the numerical determination of the isotropic velocity distribution function of the electrons and resulting macroscopic quantities. In this way on the basis of kinetic theory a deeper insigth into the temporal relaxation mechanism of the electron ensemble in weakly ionized collision dominated plasmas can be gained for many different models of the temporal behaviour of the electric field as the jump-like change and the continuous <b>aperiodical</b> as well as periodical alteration of the field.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{experimental study}} is {{performed on the}} separated flow structures around a low aspect-ratio circular cylinder (pin-fin) in a practical configuration of liquid cooling channel. Distinctive features of the present arrangement are the confinement of the cylinder at both ends, water flow at low Reynolds numbers (Re = 800, 1800, 2800), very high core flow turbulence and undeveloped boundary layers at {{the position of the}} obstacle. The horseshoe vortex system at the junctions between the cylinder and the confining walls and the near wake region behind the obstacle are deeply investigated by means of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). Upstream of the cylinder, the horseshoe vortex system turns out to be perturbed by vorticity bursts from the incoming boundary layers, leading to <b>aperiodical</b> vortex oscillations at Re = 800 or to break-away and secondary vorticity eruptions at the higher Reynolds numbers. The flow structures in the near wake show a complex three-dimensional behaviour associated with a peculiar mechanism of spanwise mass transport. High levels of free-stream turbulence trigger an early instabilization of the shear layers and strong Bloor–Gerrard vortices are observed even at Re = 800. Coalescence of these vortices and intense spanwise flow inhibit the alternate primary vortex shedding for time periods whose length and frequency increase as the Reynolds number is reduced. The inhibition of alternate vortex shedding for long time periods is finally related to the very large wake characteristic lengths and to the low velocity fluctuations observed especially at the lowest Reynolds number...|$|E

The cerebellum serves as the best platform for unification of neuroscience and genomics. The matrix of massively parallel neural nets of fractal Purkinje brain cells explains the sensorimotor, multidimensional non-Euclidean coordination by the cerebellum acting as a space-time metric tensor. In TNT, the recursion of covariant sensory vectors into contravariant motor executions converges into Eigenstates composing the cerebellar metric as a Moore-Penrose Pseudo-Inverse. The Principle of Recursion is generalized to genomic systems {{with the realization that}} the assembly of proteins from nucleic acids as governed by regulation of coding RNA (cRNA) is a contravariant multi-component functor, where in turn the quantum states of resulting protein structures both in intergenic and intronic sequences are measured in a covariant manner by non-coding RNA (ncRNA) arising as a result of proteins binding with ncDNA modulated by transcription factors. Thus, cRNA and ncRNA vectors by their interference constitute a genomic metric.

The task of {{automatic}} process {{control of the}} slime water thickening and flotation tailings clarification is the stabilization of thicken product density within the given range and keeping up the solids content in the overflow not above the permissible level with minimum use of the flocculants. In existing systems for automatic control the flocculant dosing is carried out according to the solids content in the device input (the principle of open-loop control). This leads to the excess consumption of the flocculants and increase the dispersion density of the overflow.

A mathematical model of the object control is represented in the normal form of Cauchy and further in the form of differential equations. The optimum period of quantization as the function from specified error of control and the output coordinate change is calculated. The differential equation of Bellman is obtained and the condition for minimization of the quality functional.

40|$|Precipitation of {{minerals}} in hydrothermal reservoirs can decrease porosity and permeability significantly. In these cases, {{the amount of}} hot water produced by hydrothermal heat mining installations is far too low for an economical use of the resource. Massive anhydrite cementation of formerly highly porous sandstones was found at two locations within the North German Basin. These examples illustrate that the processes causing pore space clogging need to be understood in more detail {{in order to reduce}} the exploration risk with respect to heat mining. Due to the lack of solubility data of anhydrite at high temperatures (> 100 °C) and salinities (> 100 g NaCl / L), a core flooding experiment was performed in order to determine kinetic rate law parameters for reactive flow simulations. A Bentheim sandstone core was flooded with a highly saline NaCl solution oversaturated with respect to CaSO 4. A spatially constant thermal gradient was maintained in the core increasing from 70 °C at the core inlet to 123 °C at the core outlet. Because CaSO 4 is less soluble at higher temperatures, anhydrite was expected to precipitate towards the outlet of the sandstone core. From time to time during the experiment the core was scanned by X-ray tomography to investigate the temporal development of crystal growth. Under experimental conditions, precipitation of anhydrite can only occur at high core temperature, where the CaSO 4 supersaturation Omega exceeds a threshold value of Omega= 1. 5. As a result, the anhydrite distribution within the core has <b>aperiodical</b> cementation pattern: The growth of anhydrite crystals reduces the supersaturation of CaSO 4 and thus inhibits further growth in the direction of flow, until fluid mixing by diffusion compensates for the concentration deficit again. The core flooding experiment was simulated applying (1) the Pitzer activity-coefficient approach suited for solutions at high ionic strength, (2) a new developed stochastic approach for anhydrite nucleation, which incorporates a relationship between nucleation probability, supersaturation and pore size-distribution, and (3) a reaction rate law which considers a coupling between crystal surface area and reaction rate. The simulation fits the experimental data well. The low nucleation probability and the threshold supersaturation value for precipitation cause a cementation pattern similar to the pattern in the core flooding experiment, but on a much larger spatial scale. Large scale reservoir simulations suggest that minerals such as anhydrite may clog the pore space near of fault zones which had been activated temporarily by seismic events. Without an additional heat event, anhydrite will only precipitate in small amounts where strata-bound flow is directed down-dip into deep and warmer regions of the reservoir. However, the productivity of a massive cemented reservoir can be increased by chemical stimulation, i. e. the forced dissolution of anhydrite around the borehole and on fracture walls in response to the injection of cold brines...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of the substrate materials on the mechanical, electrical and magnetotransport properties of exfoliated graphene. Therefore we prepared graphene transistor-like devices on top of crystalline molecular beam epitaxial grown GaAs-based substrates and compare the results with graphene on the commonly used silicon substrates with 300 nm silicon dioxide on top. We found that the various kind of surface configurations of our substrates ranging from amorphous silicon dioxide over polar very flat (001) GaAs to magnetic p-doped GaMnAs and rough cross-hatched InGaAs do not affect the formation or stability of graphene. The localization of the graphene flakes was done by a combination of scanning electron and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Investigations of the morphology by AFM attested graphene to follow a continuous substrate texture from approx. 8 nm to more than 1 micrometer. Extensive AFM studies including power spectral density analysis pointed out that a pattering step using electron beam lithography leaves some unwanted PMMA residues on top of the graphitic layer, even after careful lift-off. From extensive imaging ellipsometry studies, where a graphene monolayer on silicon dioxide was measured angle and wavelength dependent, the optical dispersion relation was modelled with a comprehensive algorithm basing on the Drude model and developed by Accurion company. Both, the values for extinction and refraction indices for incident wavelengths from 350 nm to 1000 nm increase with increasing wavelength. Furthermore, graphene flakes were detectable also on the crystalline GaAs-based substrates by imagine ellipsometry. The main focus of this thesis lies on the electrical and magnetotransport properties of graphene mono-, bi- and few-layer graphene on GaAs, on InGaAs and for comparison on silicon dioxide substrates. We found that position and absolute resistance value of the charge neutrality point and the charge carrier mobility exhibit an unexpected temperature dependence. The charge carrier mobility of our sample constitutes between 1660 and 3600 cm^ 2 /(Vs), what is in the range also found for identically prepared graphene samples on silicon dioxide. Magnetotransport measurements in the high field region reveal signatures of quantized transport phenomena. From the Hall-slope and the 1 /B periodicity of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations the charge carrier density was quantifiable. Interestingly, we found that at low temperatures the type of intrinsic doping was p-type for all graphene samples on GaAs and InGaAs substrates, whereas n- and p-type doping was found for graphene on silicon dioxide. Moreover, the magnetoresistance in whole magnetic field range up to temperatures of about T = 30 K is superimposed by highly reproducible universal conductance fluctuations. Additionally, the low field region is dominated by the signal of the weak localization phenomenon up to more than T = 65 K. From this, the phase coherence length, the elastic intravalley scattering length and the elastic intervalley scattering lengths were calculated. The coherence length reaches 317 nm and all determined lengths reveal values comparable to those reported in literature for graphene on silicon dioxide. In this context, an astonishing and highly reproducible <b>aperiodical</b> suppression of the weak localization signal by tuning the carrier density accompanied by lowering of all characteristic length was observed for all graphene samples on GaAs substrates. However, this feature was not observable for our graphene samples on silicon dioxide and the origin of this striking phenomenon is still unclear. ...|$|E
