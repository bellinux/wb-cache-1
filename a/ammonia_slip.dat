50|$|<b>Ammonia</b> <b>slip</b> is an {{industry}} term for ammonia passing through the SCR un-reacted. This occurs when ammonia is over-injected into gas stream, temperatures are too low for ammonia to react, or catalyst has degraded (see above).|$|E
50|$|The {{reaction}} {{requires a}} sufficient reaction time {{within a certain}} temperature range, typically 1400 and 2000 F, to be effective. At lower temperatures the NO and the ammonia do not react. Ammonia that has not reacted is called <b>ammonia</b> <b>slip</b> and is undesirable, as the ammonia can react with other combustion species, such as sulfur trioxide (SO3), to form ammonium salts.|$|E

In general, the SCR unit is located between the furnace economizer and the air heater, and the ammonia is injected into the catalyst chamber through an ammonia injection grid. As in other SCR applications, the temperature of operation is critical. <b>Ammonia</b> <b>slip</b> is also an issue with SCR technology used in power plants.|$|E
30|$|In {{terms of}} flue gas {{cleaning}} equipment, flue gas denitration and flue gas desulfurization equipment themselves form new fine particulate matter (Nielsen et al. 2002), thereby changing the emission characteristics of PM 2.5. In selective catalytic reduction devices, {{a small part of}} the <b>ammonia</b> unavoidably <b>slips.</b> The <b>ammonia</b> reacts with SO 3 to form sulfate fine particles, which leads to an increase in the concentration of fine particles (Huang et al. 2003). However, according to practical measurements, increases in particle concentrations are negligible. Certain test results on the particulate matter emissions of coal-fired power plants (Meij and Winkel 2004; Wang et al. 2008) have shown that although desulfurization devices that employ the wet limestone-gypsum method can synergistically remove particulate matter from gas, gypsum crystal particles and fine unreacted limestone particles are added to the composition of PM 2.5. The effects of different towers that remove particulate matter are significantly different. Therefore, the PM 2.5 removal mechanisms and emission characteristics of the desulfurization towers require further research.|$|R

The mixture of gases was forced by an air compressor into a steel Berthelot bomb, where they and the reduced iron catalyst were heated by a platinum spiral. A terrific explosion occurred which nearly killed an assistant. Le Chatelier found that the explosion was due to the presence of air in the apparatus used. And thus it was left for Haber to succeed where several noted French chemists, including Thenard, Sainte Claire Deville and even Berthelot had failed. Less than five years later, Haber and Claude were successful in producing ammonia on a commercial scale, acknowledging that the account of Le Chatelier's failed attempt had accelerated their research.

50|$|Most SCRs require tuning to {{properly}} perform. Part of tuning involves ensuring a proper distribution of ammonia {{in the gas}} stream and uniform gas velocity through the catalyst. Without tuning, SCRs can exhibit inefficient NOx reduction along with excessive <b>ammonia</b> <b>slip</b> due to not utilizing the catalyst surface area effectively. Another facet of tuning involves determining the proper ammonia flow for all process conditions. Ammonia flow is in general controlled based on NOx measurements taken from the gas stream or preexisting performance curves from an engine manufacturer (in the case of gas turbines and reciprocating engines). Typically, all future operating conditions must be known beforehand {{to properly}} design and tune an SCR system.|$|E
40|$|Abstract.

Although Urea Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is capable of satisfying these norms, the <b>ammonia</b> <b>slip</b> nullifies its advantages. <b>Ammonia</b> <b>slip</b> is mainly {{due to the lack}} of uniformity of ammonia at the monolith entrance. The uniformity of ammonia distribution mainly depends upon the flow parameters of exhaust gas and the injection parameters of urea water solution.

Even though the process has many advantages compared with amine based CO 2 capture processes, such as low reaction heat, low corrosiveness, and low chemical cost, it has received lesser attention than the amine processes.

Many {{studies have been conducted}} to reduce <b>ammonia</b> <b>slip,</b> but few studies have been considered property changes such as heat of reaction, overall mass transfer coefficient and transfer capacity, comprehensively. To reduce <b>ammonia</b> <b>slip,</b> in this study, three additives have been tested. The property changes with additives were examined regarding ammonia vaporization, heat of reaction, overall mass transfer coefficient, and transfer capacity. According to the results, additives were effect in reducing the ammonia vaporization without any significant change on CO 2 adsorption properties. Under laboratory conditions the most effective additive was additive A based on higher CO 2 loading capacity, and less influence on reaction heat and mass transfer coefficient.

EURO VI emission regulations present a challenge from the control point of view, so as to achieve high NOX conversion while keeping the <b>ammonia</b> <b>slip</b> under control. This thesis focuses on a model based feedforward control system to dose the urea. The SCR is modeled as a series of CSTR (continuously stirred tank reactor) with the main SCR chemical kinetics. The main reactions are ammonia adsorption, desorption, fast SCR, slow SCR, standard SCR and ammonia oxidation. The model is simplied so as to capture the important dynamics and be fast at the same time. A fast and computationally less demanding model is required from a control aspect if it has to be implemented online. Two control strategies were evaluated.

40|$|An {{important}} process {{consideration in}} ammonia-based, post-combustion CO 2 capture is {{the volatility of}} ammonia. Consequently, {{there is a need}} to adopt control measures to minimize the emission (the slip) of ammonia from such processes. This work evaluates techno-economic aspects of methods to reduce the <b>ammonia</b> <b>slip.</b> The emission of ammonia is required to be below 10 ppm while the <b>ammonia</b> <b>slip</b> from the absorber in an ammonia-based process may exceed 10 %. The ammonia control methods that are evaluated in this work are staged absorption, ammonia abatement cycle, chilled absorption and acid wash. The control methods are also evaluated with respect to local conditions, such as cooling water temperature and flue gas CO 2 concentration. Rate- and equilibrium-based thermodynamic modelling forms the basis for the evaluation process. A simplified economic estimation method is used to evaluate the utility cost of ammonia control designs under different operating conditions. The economic estimation shows that for the best case conditions the utility cost are as low as 1. 5 (sic) /tCO(2). However, the cost of the ammonia control may be more than tenfold when the available cooling water temperature is increased (> 5 degrees) or when the flue gas CO 2 concentration is decreased (< 15 vol%).

40|$|The {{stringent}} {{regulations of}} emission levels from heavy duty vehicles create {{a demand for}} new methods for reducing harmful emissions from diesel engines. This thesis deals with the modelling of the nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from heavy duty vehicles using a selective catalyst as an aftertreatment system, utilising ammonia (NH 3) for its reduction. The process of the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is nonlinear, since {{the result of the}} chemical reactions involved depends on the load operating point and the temperature. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate different methods for nonlinear system identification of SCR systems with control applications in mind. The main focus of the thesis is on finding suitable techniques for effective NOx reduction without the need of over dosage of ammonia. By using data collected from a simulator together with real measured data, new black-box identification techniques are developed. Scaling and convergence properties of the proposed algorithms are analysed theoretically. Some of the resulting models are used for controller development using e. g. feedback linearisation techniques, followed by validation in a simulator environment. The benefits of nonlinear modelling and control of the SCR system are highlighted in a comparison with control based on linear models of the system. Further, a multiple model approach is investigated for simultaneous control of NOx and tailpipe ammonia. The results indicate an improvement in terms of <b>ammonia</b> <b>slip</b> reduction in comparison with models that do not take the <b>ammonia</b> <b>slip</b> into account.

40|$|Yearly 3. 3 million {{premature}} deaths occur worldwide due to {{air pollution}} and NOx pollution counts for nearly one seventh of those [1]. This makes exhaust after-treatment a very important research and has caused the permitted emission levels for NOx to decrease to very low levels, for EURO 6 only 0. 4 g/kWh. Recently new legislation on <b>ammonia</b> <b>slip</b> with a limit of 10 ppm NH 3 has been added [2], which makes the SCR-technology more challenging. This technology injects small droplets of an aqueous Urea solution into the stream of exhaust gases and through a catalytic reaction within the SCR-catalyst, NOx is converted into Nitrogen and Water. To enable the catalytic reaction the water content in the Urea solution needs to be evaporated and the ammonia molecules need to have sufficient time to mix with the gases prior to the catalyst. The μMist® platform technology, inspired by nature, uses heat {{in order to increase}} the fluid temperature above the required saturation temperature within its constant volume chamber. When the outlet valve is opened the liquid breaks up into small droplets which eject and mix with the gases.

These units fire a variety of fuels such as coal, oil, gas, biomass, and waste. Other applications include thermal incinerators, municipal and hazardous solid waste combustion units, cement kilns, process heaters, and glass furnaces. Emission Stream Characteristics: a. Combustion Unit Size: In the United States, SNCR has been applied to boilers and other combustion units ranging in size from 50 to 6, 000 MMBtu/hr (5 to 600 MW/hr) (EPA, 2002). Until recently, it was difficult to get high levels of NOx reduction on units greater than 3, 000 MMBtu (300 MW) due to limitations in mixing. Improvements in SNCR injection and control systems have resulted in high NO X reductions (> 60 %) on utility boilers greater than 6, 000 MMBtu/hr (600 MW). (ICAC, 2000). b. Temperature: The NO X reduction reaction occurs at temperatures between 1600 °F to 2100 °F (870 °C to 1150 °C) (EPA, 2002). Proprietary chemicals, referred to as enhancers or additives, can be added to the reagent to lower the temperature range at which the NO X reduction reactions occur. c. Pollutant Loading: SNCR tends to be less effective at lower levels of uncontrolled NO X. Typical uncontrolled NO X levels vary from 200 ppm to 400 ppm (NESCAUM, 2000). SNCR is better suited for applications with high levels of PM in the waste gas stream than SCR. d.

Result analysis included also determination of time period needed for achieving the readiness of SCR system to work efficiently. The occurrence of <b>ammonia</b> <b>slip</b> emissions downstream SCR was also monitored...|$|E
40|$|Many {{alternatives}} are being investigated for the carbon capture, but none {{appears to have}} been proved as the choice for full-scale applications. This work considers the Chilled Ammonia Process for coal-fired Ultra Super Critical power plants. Three layouts are simulated with Aspen Plus and the Extended UNIQUAC thermodynamic model. Compared to a traditional layout, stripping of the wash water of the absorber or, better, splitting the rich solution between the middle and the top of the column limits greatly the <b>ammonia</b> <b>slip.</b> Moreover, splitting the regeneration over two levels reduces substantially the electric loss due to stream extraction from the turbine. The simulations show that the net electric efficiency drops from 45. 5 % to 33. 5 - 34. 5 %, the SPECCA index is 3. 8 - 4. 3 MJth/kg_CO 2 and the heat duties are 2. 7 - 2. 9 MJth/kg_CO 2. The performances may improve greatly upon optimization of the parameters...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the design and}} application of Rich Reagent Injection (RRI) at Conectiv's B. L. England Unit 1, a 138 MW cyclone-fired boiler. Installation of overfire air (OFA) has reduced uncontrolled NOx emissions from ~ 1. 2 lb/MMBtu to ~ 0. 5 lb/MMBtu. An existing SNCR system reduces these emissions an additional 30 %. Based on previous modeling of the OFA system, REI’s combustion simulation software was used to design an amine-based injection system for the staged lower furnace and to evaluate NOx reduction performance of the RRI system. Field-testing confirmed modeling predictions and demonstrated that the RRI system alone could achieve 25 - 30 % NOx reduction beyond OFA levels with less than 1 ppm <b>ammonia</b> <b>slip</b> and that RRI in combination with SNCR could achieve 50 - 55 % NOx reduction with less than 5 ppm slip. The capital costs associated with an RRI system {{are consistent with those}} of SNCR...|$|E
40|$|The {{upcoming}} stricter {{emission control}} area (ECA) regulations on sulphur and nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions from shipping {{can be handled}} by different strategies. In this study, three alternatives complying with the ECA regulations for sulphur as well as Tier III for NOX are presented and compared using life cycle assessment. None of the three alternatives will significantly reduce the life cycle impact on climate change compared to heavy fuel oil (HFO). However, all alternatives will reduce the impact on particulate matter, photochemical ozone formation, acidification and terrestrial eutrophication potential. The assessment also highlighted two important regulatory aspects. Firstly, the need to regulate the <b>ammonia</b> <b>slip</b> from use of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and secondly the need to regulate the methane slip from LNG engines. In addition, {{an analysis of the}} use of SCR in Swedish waters is presented showing that SCRs have been used on a number of ships already giving significantly reduced NOX emissions...|$|E
