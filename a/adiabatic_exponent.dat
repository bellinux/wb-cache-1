40|$|Shock {{refraction}} is {{a fundamental}} shock phenomenon observed when shocks interact with a material interface separating gases with different properties. Following refraction, a transmitted shock enters the second gas and a reflected wave returns back into the first gas. In the case of regular shock refraction, all of the waves meet at a single point called the triple-point, creating five different states for the two gases. Analytical methods based on shock polar analysis {{have been developed to}} determine the state of two ideal gases in each of the five refraction regions. Furthermore, shock refraction constitutes a basic example of complex hydrodynamic flows. For this reason, shock refraction is used in this report as one validation of the high-order accurate weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) shock-capturing method, as implemented in the HOPE code. The algorithms used in the HOPE code are described in detail, together with its current capabilities. The following two-step validation process is adopted. First, analytical results are obtained for the normal and oblique shock refraction (with shock-interface angle {beta}{sub interface} = 75 {sup o}) observed for a Ma = 1. 2 shock. To validate the single-fluid and the two-fluid implementations of the WENO method, two pairs of gases, argon/xenon, having equal <b>adiabatic</b> <b>exponents</b> {gamma} and air(acetone) /sulfur hexafluoride, having different <b>adiabatic</b> <b>exponents,</b> are considered.

In all of the cases considered, excellent agreement is found between the simulation results and the analytical predictions. The results from this investigation suggest that the WENO method is a very useful numerical method for the simulation and modeling of complex hydrodynamic flows...|$|R

Equations are developed using MSQI coordinates, but taking a logarithm of the radial coordinate. The result is relatively simple elliptical differential equations.

We compare results with rotating solutions available in the literature, which show good agreement. We study the stability of spherical solutions: instability sets in at the first maximum in mass versus central energy density; this is also consistent with results in the literature, and further lends confidence to the numerical approach.

40|$|We are {{concerned}} with globally defined entropy solutions to the Euler equations for compressible fluid flows in transonic nozzles with general cross-sectional areas. Such nozzles include the de Laval nozzles and other more general nozzles whose cross-sectional area functions are allowed at the nozzle ends to be either zero (closed ends) or infinity (unbounded ends). To achieve this, in this paper, we develop a vanishing viscosity method to construct globally defined approximate solutions and then establish essential uniform estimates in weighted L^p norms for {{the whole range of}} physical <b>adiabatic</b> <b>exponents</b> γ∈ (1, ∞), so that the viscosity approximate solutions satisfy the general L^p compensated compactness framework. The viscosity method is designed to incorporate artificial viscosity terms with the natural Dirichlet boundary conditions to ensure the uniform estimates.

The approach and techniques developed here apply to other problems with similar difficulties. In particular, we successfully apply them to construct globally defined spherically symmetric entropy solutions to the Euler equations for all γ∈ (1, ∞). Comment: 32 page...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{monograph}} {{is devoted}} to the study of boundary value problems for equationsof viscous gas dynamics, named compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The math-ematical theory of Navier -Stokes equations is very interesting in its own right, butits principal significance lies in the central role Navier-Stokes equations now playin fluid dynamics. Most of this book concentrates on those aspects of the theorythat have proven useful in applications. Although the theory is satisfactory in what concerns local time behaviorand small data, many issues of global behavior of solutions for large data are farfrom being understood. There are a vast range of unsolved problems concerningquestions such as regularity of solutions to compressible Navier-Stokes equations,the theory of weak solutions for small <b>adiabatic</b> <b>exponents,</b> existence theory forheat conducting fluids. Existence theory. This issue is important since no progress in the mathematicaltheory of Navier-Stokes equations can be made without answering the basic ques-tions on their well-posedness. We focus on existence results for the inhomogeneousin/out flow problem, in particular the problem of the flow around a body placed ina finite domain. Notice that the majority of known results are related to viscousgas flows in domains bounded by impermeable walls. In/out flow problems arestill poorly investigated. With applications toshape optimization theory in mind, we consider the problem of the flow around abody placed in a bounded domain for small Mach and Reynolds numbers. Stability of solutions with respect to nonsmooth data and domain perturbations. Propagation of rapid oscillations in compressible fluids. In compressible viscousflows, any irregularities in the initial and boundary data are transferred insidethe flow domain along fluid particle trajectories. The transport of singularities inviscous compressible flows was studied by Hoff [56, 57]. In this book we discuss thepropagation of rapid oscillations of the density, which can be regarded as acousticwaves. The main idea is that any rapidly oscillating sequence is associated withsome stochastic field named the Young measure (see Tartar and Perthamefor basic ideas). We establish that the distribution function of this stochasticfield satisfies a kinetic equation of a special form, which leads to a rigorous modelfor propagation of nonlinear acoustic waves. Notice that oscillations can be inducednot only by oscillations of initial and boundary data, but also by irregularities ofthe boundary of the flow domain. Domain dependence of solutions to compressible Navier-Stokes equations. This issue is important because of applications to shape optimization theory. The first global result on domain dependence of solutions to compressible Navier-Stokes equations is due to Feireisl, who proved that the set of solutions tocompressible Navier-Stokes equations is compact provided the set of flow domainsis compact in the Kuratowski-Mosco topology and their boundaries have “uni-formly small” volumes. We prove that the compactness result holds true if theset of flow domains is compact in the Kuratowski-Mosco topology, and also thatsome cost functionals, such as the drag and the work of hydrodynamical forces,are continuous in this topology. With applications to shape optimization in mind,we consider the shape differentiability of strong solutions and give formulae forthe shape derivative of the drag functional...|$|R

The absolute cylinder pressure {{is the result of}} an exponent of the dynamic compression ratio.

This compensates for the temperature rise caused by compression, as well as heat lost to the cylinder.

40|$|Context: Recently {{the white}} dwarf (WD) mass {{distribution}} of cataclysmic variables (CVs) {{has been found}} to dramatically disagree with the predictions of the standard CV formation model. The high mean WD mass among CVs is not imprinted in the currently observed sample of CV progenitors and can therefore not be attributed to selection effects. The standard CV formation model might thus miss an important ingredient that can explain the discrepancy between the WD masses among CVs and their progenitors. Two explanations have been put forward: either the WD grows in mass during CV evolution or the CV formation is preceded by a (short) phase of thermal timescale mass transfer (TTMT) in which the WD gains a sufficient amount of mass from its companion. Aims: Here we investigate if and under which conditions a phase of TTMT prior to the CV formation, which has been considered a rare channel in previous works, can become a typical channel of CV formation and if the problem with the high WD masses can be solved in this way. Methods: We perform binary population synthesis models using the Binary_C code to simulate the present intrinsic CV population. We use different models to investigate how several key aspects of CV evolution can influence the effect of a TTMT phase on the WD mass distribution. We carry out a statistical analysis on the characteristics of each model and compare these with the characteristics of a sample of observed CVs. Results: We are able to produce a large number of massive WDs if we assume significant mass loss due to wind {{from the surface of the}} WD. The models that include this wind predict that two-thirds of the intrinsic CV population had a phase of TTMT and produce a mean WD mass that agrees with the observed value. The most convincing agreement between observations and model predictions is reached if, in addition to the TTMT wind, mass loss during nova cycles is taken into account. Conclusions: The high WD masses among CVs can be explained by a preliminary phase of TTMT if such a TTMT wind exists. An accurate prescription for the <b>adiabatic</b> mass-radius <b>exponent</b> and corresponding critical mass ratio is of crucial importance for the formation of WDs with a mass of ∼ 0. 8. Our models predict that the majority of massive WDs among CVs have experienced TTMT...|$|R
