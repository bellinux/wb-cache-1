5|$|In 1973 a jadeitite axehead {{was found}} {{alongside}} the track; {{it is thought}} to have been placed there as an offering. One of over 100similar <b>axe</b> heads found in Britain and Ireland, its good condition and its precious material suggest that it was a symbolic <b>axe,</b> rather than one used to cut wood. Because of the difficulty of working this material, which was derived from the Alpine area of Europe, all the <b>axe</b> heads of this type found in Great Britain are thought to have been non-utilitarian and to have represented some form of currency or be the products of gift exchange. Radiocarbon dating of the peat in which the <b>axe</b> head was discovered suggests that it was deposited in about 3200 BC. Wooden artefacts found at the site include paddles, a dish, arrow shafts, parts of four hazel bows, a throwing <b>axe,</b> yew pins, digging sticks, a mattock, a comb, toggles, and a spoon fragment. Finds made from other materials, such as flint flakes, arrowheads, and a chipped flint <b>axe</b> (in mint condition) have also been made.|$|E
5|$|The <b>axe</b> and log logo was {{conceived}} {{by the first}} Camp Chief, Francis Gidney, in the early 1920s to distinguish Gilwell Park from the Scout Headquarters. Gidney wanted to associate Gilwell Park with the outdoors and Scoutcraft rather than the business or administrative Headquarters offices. Scouters present at the original Wood Badge courses regularly saw <b>axe</b> blades masked for safety by being buried in a log. Seeing this, Gidney chose the <b>axe</b> and log as the totem of Gilwell Park.|$|E
5|$|The main {{drainage}} outlets {{flowing through}} the Moors and Levels are the rivers <b>Axe,</b> Brue, Huntspill, Parrett, Tone, and Yeo, together with the King's Sedgemoor Drain, an artificial channel into which the River Cary now runs. Previously, the Cary ran into the Tone while the Brue ran through Meare Pool (now drained) and the Panborough Gap, {{and then into the}} <b>Axe.</b> Another accomplishment in the Middle Ages was the construction of the tidal Pillrow Cut, joining the Brue and <b>Axe.</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} based on a material of 45 battle <b>axes</b> from The Swedish History Museum, both miniature <b>axes</b> and regular boat <b>axes</b> from the middle Neolithic era. The geographical demarcation is the province of Västergötland in Sweden. The aim of the study is to analyze the <b>axes,</b> mainly morphologically and size-wise, to try to understand and define miniature <b>axes</b> in comparison to the regular boat <b>axes.</b> Another intention is to try to reveal if there are any differences between the miniatures and the regular <b>axes</b> regarding importance and function of the <b>axes.</b> The result is presented by dint of several tables of measures and attributes of all the <b>axes</b> as well as numerous scatter plots and pie charts showing physical attributes and signs of use of the <b>axes</b> in question. The results show for instance that miniature <b>axes</b> more often than not are sloppily made and more well-worn compared to the regular boat <b>axes.</b> According to the study this might {{have to do with the}} probability of the miniature <b>axes</b> being made for children...|$|R

40|$|Germination of {{embryonic}} <b>axes</b> from dormant grain is inhibited by low concentrations of abscisic acid (ABA) compared with <b>axes</b> from nondormant grain. Incubation of dormant grain <b>axes</b> in 0. 05 to 50 micromolar ABA caused the prolonged synthesis {{of a set}} of heat-stable proteins. Two of these proteins were identified as dehydrins. In nondormant grain <b>axes,</b> 100 - to 1000 -fold greater ABA concentrations were required to produce similar results. When embryonic <b>axes</b> of dormant wheat (Triticum aestivum) grain were imbibed without ABA, endogenous ABA levels increased 2. 5 -fold by 4 hours and then gradually declined. Heat-stable proteins were continuously synthesized for at least 18 hours. No increase in endogenous ABA was observed when nondormant grain <b>axes</b> were imbibed. Endogenous ABA levels in nondormant grain <b>axes</b> remained constant at 4 hours and then declined. The nondormant grain <b>axes</b> initially synthesized the heat-stable proteins, but that synthesis disappeared between 8 and 12 hours. These results showing the prolonged synthesis of ABA-responsive, heat-stable proteins by dormant grain <b>axes,</b> demonstrate that biochemical differences occur when <b>axes</b> from dormant compared with nondormant grains are imbibed...|$|R

40|$|The {{filtering}} method {{considered in}} this paper is based on approximation of a spatial object in d-dimensional space by the minimal convex polyhedron that encloses the object and whose facets are normal to preselected <b>axes.</b> These <b>axes</b> {{are not necessarily the}} standard coordinate <b>axes</b> and, furthermore, their number is not determined by the dimension of the space. We optimize filtering by selecting optimal such <b>axes</b> based on a pre-processing analysis of stored objects or a sample thereof. The number of <b>axes</b> selected represents a trade-off between access time and storage overhead, as more <b>axes</b> usually lead to better filtering but require more overhead to store the associated access structures. We address the problem of minimizing the number of <b>axes</b> required to achieve a predefined quality of filtering and the reverse problem of optimizing the quality of filtering when the number of <b>axes</b> is fixed.

5|$|Before the 13th {{century the}} direct {{route to the}} sea at Highbridge was blocked by gravel banks and peat near Westhay. The course of the river {{partially}} encircled Glastonbury from the south, around the western side (through Beckery), and then north through the Panborough-Bleadney gap in the Wedmore-Wookey Hills, to join the River <b>Axe</b> just north of Bleadney. This route {{made it difficult for}} the officials of Glastonbury Abbey to transport produce from their outlying estates to the Abbey, and when the valley of the river <b>Axe</b> was in flood it backed up to flood Glastonbury itself. Sometime between 1230 and 1250 a new channel was constructed westwards into Meare Pool north of Meare, and further westwards to Mark Moor. It then divided into two channels, one the Pilrow cut flowing north through Mark to join the <b>Axe</b> near Edingworth, and the other directly west to the sea at Highbridge. During monastic times, there were several fish weirs along the lower reaches of the river. They used either nets or baskets, the fishing rights belonging to the Bishop of Bath and Wells and the Abbot of Glastonbury.|$|E

Though most songs originated from a guitar or bass riff from Ballou or Newton, all members had equal input on the writing process, with each member proposing different songs. Vocalist Bannon wrote a few songs for <b>Axe</b> to Fall, but were scrapped because they were slower {{than the rest of the}} songs, and did not fit the energy of the album.|$|E
