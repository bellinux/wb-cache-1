5|$|According to the {{economist}} Zdzisław Sadowski, the Poles were generally euphoric <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> {{of the era}} of communist rule and Soviet domination. Because of {{the belief that the}} Balcerowicz Plan would quickly result in universal Western-like prosperity, the plan enjoyed broad social support, which would cause any conceivable competing pursuits of more moderate economic policies to be politically unrealistic.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Communist rule in China, the social status of women {{improved}} greatly. Women were empowered to work outside the home. Communist rule also brought <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of practices such as foot binding, child marriages, prostitution, and arranged marriages. China has seen a decrease in domestic violence due to government-supported grassroots programs to counter these practices. Women in rural areas remain largely uneducated.|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin {{had been}} told that the Beagle was {{expected}} to sail <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of September 1831, but fitting out took longer. The Admiralty Instructions were received on 14 November, and on 23 November she was moved to anchorage, ready to depart. Repeated Westerly gales caused delays, and forced them to turn back after departing on 10 and 21 December. Drunkenness at Christmas lost another day. Finally, on the morning of 27 December, the Beagle left its anchorage in the Barn Pool, under Mount Edgecumbe {{on the west side of}} Plymouth Sound and set out on its surveying expedition.|$|E

5|$|Early in 197BC, Flamininus summoned Attalus to {{join him}} at Elateia (now in Roman hands) and from there they {{traveled}} together to attend a Boeotian council in Thebes to discuss which side Boeotia would take in the war. At the council Attalus spoke first, reminding the Boeotians of the many things he and his ancestors had done for them, but during his address he stopped talking and collapsed, with {{one side of his}} body paralyzed. Attalus was taken back to Pergamon, where he died {{around the time of the}} Battle of Cynoscephalae, which brought <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the Second Macedonian War.|$|E

5|$|Sorabji {{appears to}} have had a {{difficult}} relationship with his father. Although the father was musically cultured and financed the publication of several of Sorabji's compositions (enabling 14 of them to be published between 1921 and 1931), he did not want his son to become a musician. He is also alleged to have brought <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of his wife's singing career.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese would {{subsequently}} {{attempt to}} occupy the city, but never managed to take it. In his journal of an expedition to the region in 1497-1499, the explorer João de Sá, who accompanied Vasco da Gama on the voyage, wrote that Magadoxo (Mogadishu) was controlled by Moors. A big town surrounded by four towers, it had houses several storeys high and large palaces in its center. De Sá and his men bombarded the city before continuing southwards along the seaboard. The Hawiye Somali, however, were later successful in defeating the Ajuran State and bringing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of Muzaffar rule.|$|E
5|$|The Tulunid triumph was {{to prove}} ephemeral, however.

Finally, in 905 the Abbasids launched a campaign that rapidly brought <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of Tulunid autonomy and fully re-incorporated their lands into the Caliphate.|$|E

5|$|Christianity {{had been}} the {{official}} imperial religion of the Roman Empire, and the first churches were built in England {{in the second half}} of the 4th century, overseen by a hierarchy of bishops and priests. Many existing pagan shrines were converted to Christian use and few pagan sites still operated by the 5th century. The collapse of the Roman system in the late 5th century, however, brought <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of formal Christian religion in the east of England, and the new Germanic immigrants arrived with their own polytheistic gods, including Woden, Thunor and Tiw, still reflected in various English place names. Despite the resurgence of paganism in England, Christian communities still survived in more western areas such as Gloucestershire and Somerset.|$|E
5|$|During a hailstorm in Washington state, {{university}} students run to find shelter. One girl, Lauren (Kristi Angus), {{stands in the}} rain, lights a cigarette, and goes up in flames. Millennium Group consultant Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) travels to the university to interview witnesses to the death. A teaching assistant tells Black that the dead girl was highly intelligent, pointing out an armillary sphere Lauren had constructed. She also tells Black that the previous Millennium Group contact had taken great interest in this sphere. Black did not realize the Group had sent another member, but on leaving, he meets the man in question—Dennis Hoffman (Brad Dourif). Hoffman describes his theories to Black, detailing how when several planets achieve syzygy on May 5, 2000, a series of natural disasters will bring <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the world. Hoffman believes that this cataclysm will be preceded by strange events and weather patterns.|$|E

5|$|On November21, {{insurance}} {{payments for}} losses {{were expected to}} exceed $12million. On January1, 1963, a $2million relief fund was authorized by President Kennedy. Another $5.4million in relief funds were provided by President Lyndon B. Johnson on February15, 1964. The United States Congress provided Guam with $60million, including $45million through federal loans, mainly to help rebuild the territory and promote expansion of the economy. Additionally, the storm brought <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of military security on the island, which in turn aided economic growth. Within five years of this decision, Japanese tourism to the island dramatically increased, prompting a major {{increase in the number}} of hotels. In the long term, Typhoon Karen, along with other destructive storms, shaped the development of the island's infrastructure. It led to higher quality buildings and more efficient utilities that could withstand powerful typhoons. Since Karen, most buildings on the island have been constructed with concrete and steel.|$|E
5|$|Prior to its arrival, {{flooding}} {{across the}} central United States killed six people, forced {{thousands of people}} from their homes, and left at least $76million in damage (1986USD). Additional flooding from Paine exacerbated the situation; the flooding affected 52 of the 77 counties in Oklahoma, {{which resulted in a}} total of $350 million in damage, half of which from agriculture. The remnants of Paine brought <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the extended period of rainfall, which overall had forced 55,000 people from their homes, including 1,200 in East Saint Louis, Illinois where a floodgate broke. It was described as one of the worst floods in Oklahoma history.|$|E

After the failure of the negotiations he continued the resistance, attempting unsuccessfully to push the Byzantines back. During his period of rule, Ivan Vladislav tried to strengthen the Bulgarian army, reconstructed many Bulgarian fortresses and even carried out a counter-offensive, but he died at the Battle of Dyrrhachium in 1018. After his death his widow, Empress Maria, the Patriarch and most of the nobility finally surrendered to Basil II, who soon suppressed the last remnants of resistance and brought <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the First Bulgarian Empire.|$|E

Djokovic entered the match undefeated {{for the first five}} months of the year having gone 41–0 with a total winning streak of 43 matches (his last loss had come against Federer at the World Tour Finals). It was the first Grand Slam tournament in which Djokovic had ever been seeded higher than Federer. Djokovic had defeated Federer in their three previous meetings in 2011, however, Federer shocked many by taking the first two sets. Djokovic won the third set and as the fourth set went on the light began to fade and it was clear that if the match went to a fifth set {{it would have to be}} continued the next day. Djokovic served for the fourth set at 5–4 but was broken and Federer closed out the match in a tiebreaker.|$|E
5|$|The English cloth {{industry}} grew considerably at {{the start}} of the 15th century, and a new class of international English merchant emerged, typically based in London or the South-West, prospering at the expense of the older, shrinking economies of the eastern towns. These new trading systems brought <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of many of the international fairs and the rise of the chartered company. Fishing in the North Sea expanded into deeper waters, backed by commercial investment from major merchants. Between 1440 and 1480, however, Europe entered a recession and England suffered the Great Slump: trade collapsed, driving down agricultural prices, rents and ultimately the acceptable levels of royal taxation. The resulting tensions and discontent played an important part in Jack Cade's popular uprising in 1450 and the subsequent Wars of the Roses. By the end of Middle Ages the economy had begun to recover and considerable improvements were being made in metalworking and shipbuilding that would shape the Early Modern economy.|$|E
