5|$|Sodium ferrocyanide, {{also known}} as yellow prussiate of soda, is {{sometimes}} added to salt as an anticaking agent. The additive is considered safe for human consumption. Such anti-caking agents have been added since at least 1911 when magnesium carbonate was first added to salt to make it flow more freely. The safety of sodium ferrocyanide as a food additive {{was found to be}} provisionally acceptable by the Committee on Toxicity in 1988. Other <b>anticaking</b> <b>agents</b> sometimes used include tricalcium phosphate, calcium or magnesium carbonates, fatty acid salts (acid salts), magnesium oxide, silicon dioxide, calcium silicate, sodium aluminosilicate and calcium aluminosilicate. Both the European Union and the United States Food and Drug Administration permitted the use of aluminium in the latter two compounds.|$|E
25|$|Dried honey has the {{moisture}} extracted from liquid honey to create completely solid, nonsticky granules. This process {{may or may}} not include the use of drying and <b>anticaking</b> <b>agents.</b> Dried honey is used in baked goods, and to garnish desserts.|$|E
500|$|Salt is {{essential}} to the health of humans and other animals, and {{it is one of the}} five basic taste sensations. Salt is used in many cuisines around the world, and it is often found in salt shakers on diners' eating tables for their personal use on food. [...] Salt is also an ingredient in many manufactured foodstuffs. Table salt is a refined salt containing about 97 to 99percent sodium chloride. Usually, <b>anticaking</b> <b>agents</b> such as sodium aluminosilicate or magnesium carbonate are added to make it free-flowing. Iodized salt, containing potassium iodide, is widely available. Some people put a desiccant, such as a few grains of uncooked rice or a saltine cracker, in their salt shakers to absorb extra moisture and help break up salt clumps that may otherwise form.|$|E
50|$|Celery salt {{normally}} {{contains an}} <b>anticaking</b> <b>agent</b> such as silicon dioxide or calcium silicate.|$|R
50|$|Dishwasher salt is 95% sodium chloride; an <b>anticaking</b> <b>agent</b> (e.g. sodium {{ferrocyanide}} or potassium ferrocyanide) constitutes the remaining 5%.|$|R

50|$|The United States Food and Drug Administration {{considers}} talc (magnesium silicate) to {{be generally}} recognized as safe (GRAS) {{for use as}} an <b>anticaking</b> <b>agent</b> in table salt in concentrations smaller than 2%.|$|R
50|$|An <b>anticaking</b> <b>agent</b> is an {{additive}} {{placed in}} powdered or granulated materials, such as table salt or confectionaries {{to prevent the}} formation of lumps (caking) and for easing packaging, transport, and consumption.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{some common}} table salt, kosher salt {{typically}} contains no added iodine. Some brands will include <b>anticaking</b> <b>agents</b> in small amounts.|$|E
5000|$|An {{anticaking}} agent in salt is denoted in the ingredients, for example, as [...] "anti-caking agent (554)", which is sodium aluminosilicate, a man-made product. This product {{is present in}} many commercial table salts as well as dried milk, egg mixes, sugar products, flours and spices. In Europe, sodium ferrocyanide (535) and potassium ferrocyanide (536) are more common <b>anticaking</b> <b>agents</b> in table salt. [...] "Natural" [...] <b>anticaking</b> <b>agents</b> used in more expensive table salt include calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate.|$|E

5000|$|Azomite is used {{primarily}} as a natural feed <b>anticaking</b> <b>agent</b> and remineralizer for depleted soils. Hydrated Sodium Calcium Aluminosilicate (HSCAS), its primary component, is listed in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR 582.2729) as an <b>anticaking</b> <b>agent</b> for livestock feed and is {{generally recognized as safe}} (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Agriculture and livestock producers have used Azomite to support livestock health and plant nutrition for over seventy years. While it contains minute quantities of naturally occurring contaminants, Azomite falls well within the guidelines for use in animal feed by the Association of American Feed Control Officials.|$|R
50|$|Natural {{freshwater}} {{diatomaceous earth}} {{is used in}} agriculture for grain storage as an <b>anticaking</b> <b>agent,</b> {{as well as an}} insecticide. It is approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a feed additive to prevent caking.|$|R

50|$|In some countries, {{especially}} those in Europe, dishwashers include a built-in water softener that removes calcium and magnesium ions from the water. Dishwasher salt, which is coarse-grained sodium chloride (table salt), is used to recharge the resin in the built-in ion-exchange system. The coarse grains prevent it from clogging the softener unit; unlike certain types of salt used for culinary purposes, it does not contain added insoluble <b>anticaking</b> <b>agents</b> or magnesium salts. The presence of magnesium salts will defeat the purpose of removing magnesium from the water softener. <b>Anticaking</b> <b>agents</b> may lead to clogging or may contain magnesium. Table salt may contain added iodine {{in the form of}} sodium iodide or potassium iodide. These compounds will not affect the ion-exchange system, but adding table salt to the dishwasher's water softening unit can damage it.|$|E
50|$|Calcium {{silicate}} {{is used as}} an <b>anticaking</b> <b>agent</b> in food preparation, including {{table salt}} and as an antacid. It is approved by the United Nations' FAO and WHO bodies as a safe food additive in a large variety of products.|$|R

50|$|Some <b>anticaking</b> <b>agents</b> are soluble in water, {{while others}} are soluble in {{alcohols}} or other organic solvents. They function either by absorbing excess moisture or by coating particles and making them water-repellent. Calcium silicate (CaSiO3), a commonly used anti-caking agent, added to e.g. table salt, absorbs both water and oil.|$|E
50|$|Potassium {{ferrocyanide}} finds many niche {{applications in}} industry. It {{and the related}} sodium salt are widely used as <b>anticaking</b> <b>agents</b> for both road salt and table salt. The potassium and sodium ferrocyanides are also used in the purification of tin and the separation of copper from molybdenum ores. Potassium ferrocyanide {{is used in the}} production of wine and citric acid.|$|E
50|$|Lloyd Hall {{is often}} falsely {{credited}} with the original invention of Seifert's process. However, Hall took {{a leading role in}} developing the patent after it was sold to Griffith Laboratories, adding hygroscopic agents such as corn sugar and glycerine to inhibit caking of the powder. Most of his patents in meat curing dealt with either preventing caking of the curing composition, or remedying undesired effects caused by the <b>anticaking</b> <b>agents.</b>|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{stability}} of their complexation with iron, ferrocyanides (Sodium ferrocyanide E535, Potassium ferrocyanide E536, and Calcium ferrocyanide E538) do not decompose to lethal levels {{in the human body}} and are used in the food industry as, e.g., an <b>anticaking</b> <b>agent</b> in table salt.|$|R
50|$|The {{ingredients}} in the Australian and New Zealand cinnamon product are sorbitol, flavor, <b>anticaking</b> <b>agent</b> (470), sweeteners (955, 950) and colours (129, 133); while the orange product contains food acid (330), sweetener (951) (instead of 950), and colours (102, 129) (instead of 129, 133). The orange product advises that it contains Phenylalanine.|$|R
50|$|Fumed silica {{serves as}} a {{universal}} thickening <b>agent</b> and an <b>anticaking</b> <b>agent</b> (free-flow agent) in powders. Like silica gel, it {{serves as a}} desiccant. It is used in cosmetics for its light-diffusing properties. It is used as a light abrasive, in products like toothpaste. Other uses include filler in silicone elastomer and viscosity adjustment in paints, coatings, printing inks, adhesives and unsaturated polyester resins.It is also used in the production of cat litter box filler and as a core material in the production of vacuum insulated panels.|$|R
50|$|Powdered {{sugar is}} {{available}} in varying degrees of fineness, most commonly XXX, XXXX, and 10X: the greater the number of Xs, the finer the particles. Finer particles absorb more moisture, which results in caking. Corn starch or tricalcium phosphate is added at 3 to 5% concentration to absorb moisture and to improve flow by reducing friction between sugar crystals.Because of these <b>anticaking</b> <b>agents,</b> it cannot always {{be used as a}} substitute for granulated sugar, such as in coffee or tea.|$|E
