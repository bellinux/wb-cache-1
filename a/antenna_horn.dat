40|$|Abstract—The {{substrate}} {{integrated waveguide}} (SIW) tech-nology allows to construct {{several types of}} commonly used antennas in a planar way. However, some practical constraints limit their performances when frequencies below 20 GHz are considered. In the case of SIW horn antennas, the available substrates are much thinner than the wavelength yielding to poor matching and undesired back radiation. In this paper, an innovative structure to overcome these limitations is presented. It consists of a transition printed on the same SIW substrate, which improves both the radiation and the matching performances of conventional SIW horns. The horn shape is also further optimized by reducing its dimensions required for a given directivity. This is obtained by modifying the horn profile in order to effectively combine different TE modes. Guidelines are provided to design this type of thin and compact SIW horn antenna. They were ap-plied to manufacture a prototype in the Ku-band with a substrate thinner than. Measurement results validate the proposed concepts showing excellent performances.

The accuracy of the retrieved parameters in the GPR data inversion depends on {{the accuracy of the}} GPR external calibration. In this research we studied the stability and the repeatability of two different GPR systems, namely, frequency- and timedomain systems. A combination of a vector network analyzer and 800 – 5200 MHz horn antenna was used as a frequency-domain GPR (FD-GPR) whereas a GSSI GPR system using a 900 MHz bowtie antenna was used as a time-domain GPR (TD-GPR). Both GPR systems including their antennas were calibrated several times using measurements with the antennas at different heights over a perfect electric conductor (PEC) in the laboratory as well as over a water layer. In addition, measurements were performed over a thin water layer and a relatively thick sandy soil layer as validating medium. The results showed that the FD-GPR is relatively stable while the TD-GPR presents a significant drift which can be accounted for using corrections based on the air direct-coupling waves (free-space measurements). Water- and PEC-based calibrations provided very similar results for the GPR calibration functions. Inversions for the water layer and the sandy soil layer provided reliable results and showed a high degree of the repeatability for both radar systems. The error on the calibration based on inaccurate antenna heights over PEC showed the significant errors on the inversion results for the directive <b>antenna</b> (<b>horn</b> antenna) but less error for the bowtie antenna.
