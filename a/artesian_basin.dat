The foliage of the trees breaks the force of rain and prevents the impact of soil by raindrops. A considerable portion of the precipitation is let down to the ground slowly by this three-story cover of trees, bushes, and floor plants and in this manner the rain, falling on a well-forested area, is held back and instead of rushing down to the sea rapidly in the form of destructive floods, is fed gradually to the springs and to the underground <b>artesian</b> <b>basins</b> where it is held for use over a much longer interval...

40|$|Conceptual and {{respective}} quantitative {{models of}} speleogenesis/karstifi cation developed for unconfi ned aquifers do not adequately representspeleogenesis in confi ned settings. A conceptual model for speleogenesis in confi ned settings is suggested, based on views about hydrauliccontinuity in <b>artesian</b> <b>basins</b> and close cross-formation communication between aquifers in multi-storey artesian systems. Soluble unitssandwiched between insoluble porous/fi ssured formations (common aquifers) initially serve as low permeability beds separating aquifersin a confi ned system. Conduits evolve as result of vertical hydraulic communication between aquifers across the soluble bed ("transversespeleogenesis"). Recharge from the adjacent aquifer is dispersed and uniform, and fl ow paths across the soluble bed are rather short. There {{is a specific}} hydrogeologic mechanism inherent in artesian transverse speleogenesis (restricted input/output) that suppresses the positive flow-dissolution feedback and hence speleogenetic competition in fissure networks, and accounts {{for the development of}} more pervasive channelling in confi ned settings, of maze patterns where appropriate structural prerequisites exist. This is the fundamental cause for the distinctions between cave morphologies evolving in unconfi ned and confi ned aquifers and for eventual distinctions of karstic permeability, storage characteristics and flow system behaviour between the two types of aquifers. Passage network density (the ratio of the cave length to the area of the cave fi eld, km/km 2) and cave porosity (a fraction of the volume of a cave block, occupied by mapped cavities) are roughly one order of magnitude greater in confi ned settings than in unconfined. Average areal coverage (a fraction of the area of the cave field occupied by passages in a plan view) is about 5 times greater in confi ned settings. Conduit permeability in unconfi ned settings tends to be highly heterogeneous, whereas it is more homogeneous in confi ned settings. The storage characteristics of confined karstifi ed aquifers are much greater. Recognition of the differences between origin, organisation and behaviour of karst systems evolved in unconfi ned and confined settings can improve efficiency of exploration and management of various resources in karst regions and adequacy of assessment of karst-related hazards...|$|R
40|$|Western {{and central}} Utah has 16 areas whose wells or springs yield hot water (35 C or higher), warm water (20 - 34. 5 C), and {{slightly}} warm water (15. 5 - 19. 5 C). These {{areas and the}} highest recorded water temperature for each are: Lower Bear River Area, 105 C; Bonneville Salt Flats, 88 C; Cove Fort-Sulphurdale, 77 C; Curlew Valley, 43 C; East Shore Area, 60 C; Escalante Desert, 149 C; Escalante Valley (Roosevelt, 269 C, and Thermo, 85 C); Fish Springs, 60. 5 C; Grouse Creek Valley, 42 C; Heber Valley (Midway, 45 C); Jordan Valley, 58. 5 C; Pavant Valley-Black Rock Desert, 67 C; Sevier Desert (Abraham-Crater Hot Springs, 82 C); Sevier Valley (Monroe-Red Hill, 76. 5 C, and Joseph Hot Spring, 64 C); Utah Valley, 46 C; and Central Virgin River Basin, 42 C. The only hot water in eastern Utah comes from the oil wells of the Ashley Valley Oil Field, which in 1977 yielded 4400 acre-feet of water at 43 C to 55 C. Many other areas yield warm water (20 to 34. 5 C) and slightly warm water (15. 5 to 19. 5 C). With {{the possible exception of}} the Roosevelt KGRA, Crater Hot Springs in the Sevier Desert, Escalante Desert, Pavant-Black Rock, Cove Fort-Sulphurdale, and Coyote Spring in Curlew Valley, which may derive their heat from buried igneous bodies, the heat that warms the thermal water is derived from the geothermal gradient. Meteoric water circulates through fractures or permeable rocks deep within the earth, where it is warmed; it then rises by convection or artesian pressure and issues at the surface as springs or is tapped by wells. Most thermal springs thus rise along faults, but some thermal water is trapped in confined aquifers so that it spreads laterally as it mixes with and warms cooler near-surface water. This spreading of thermal waters is evident in Cache Valley, in Jordan Valley, and in southern Utah Valley; likely the spreading occurs in many other <b>artesian</b> <b>basins</b> where it has not yet been recognized. In the East Shore Area thermal water trapped in confined aquifers warms water in overlying aquifers. Some of the areas of hot water, such as Roosevelt, Pavant-Black Rock, and Cove Fort-Sulphurdale, probably have a potential to produce electricity; the estimated potential at Roosevelt is 300 megawatts. But the many areas of warm and hot water whose temperatures are too low to produce electricity may still have their waters utilized for space heating, as is planned for Monroe, for greenhouses, and for the processing of farm produce. In this report are tables that give records of about 1500 thermal springs and wells, 66 yield hot water, more than 400 yield warm water, and more than 1000 yield slightly warm water. The records include location, ownership, temperature, yield, depth (of wells), geologic unit, and some chemical analyses...|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 45 - 47. The {{area around}} Uitenhage in the Eastern Cape forms {{the centre of}} one of the biggest <b>artesian</b> {{groundwater}} <b>basins</b> in South Africa. The Table Mountain Group quartzitic sandstones are overlain by a thickness of postPalaeozoic sediments giving rise to artesian groundwater. The most wellknown of this manifestation are the springs at Uitenhage which have been used since pre-historic times and are currently a principal source of water for the municipal supply. At the turn of the 20 th century, with the introduction of drilling machines into the area a number of boreholes were constructed. The resultant tapping into the artesian supply resulted in the spring-flow lessening and a decline in groundwater levels on introduction of further boreholes. At the request of the local community this special region was proclaimed a groundwater protection area. Over the years the abstraction within the area has risen and is currently at 3. 24 million m³/a. However the licensed, legally abstractable, figure stands at 6. 15 million m³/a. Groundwater levels have declined although the flow from the boreholes has not. Using GIS aU the available and pertinent information required for the management of the control area and for the estimation of the groundwater resource has been brought together. Using raster modelling techniques the amount of groundwater available within the system and the viability of sustained abstraction were assessed. A site-specific raster model has been designed to visualise and quantify the expected effects of new boreholes in the area...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The paper {{describes}} {{the influence of}} József Tóth and his groundwater flow theory {{on the evolution of}} paradigms in Hungarian hydrogeology. The artesian mechanism has been the basic framework for hydrogeologists for the last two centuries. The evolution from the <b>artesian</b> paradigm to <b>basin</b> hydraulics took place in four stages in Hungary. The first stage was represented by the activity of Szebényi (1955), Urbancsek (1963) and Rónai (1963). Their studies were limited to shallow depths, recognizing the correlation between downward and upward flow with high and low topography, but did not produce a model for the observed pattern. In the second stage Erdélyi (1976) enhanced the gravity-driven flow-pattern for shallow depths but avoided the question of deep overpressures. In the third stage Tóth and Almási (2001) concluded that the groundwater flow pattern is made up of an overpressured regime driven by tectonic compression and a topography-driven meteoric regime above it. In the fourth stage Tóth and Almási (2001) 's conclusions were confirmed by studies for the Danube-Tisza Interfluve (DTI) by Mádl-Szőnyi and Tóth (2009). It was found that the gravity-flow systems are perched on ubiquitously ascending waters and that vertical flow occurs through conductive faults and between rock grains...|$|R
