[...] Beck recalled, [...] "I remember [...] Townshend looking daggers <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>when</b> he heard it... {{because it was}} a bit near the mark. He didn't want anybody meddling with that territory [...] at all". Townshend also took to referring to Beck and Page as [...] "flashy little guitarists of very little brain" [...] for their perceived subterfuge (Page responded with [...] "Townshend got into feedback because he couldn't play single notes"). In a later interview, Townshend explained ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna was {{inspired}} by the look that actor James Stewart gave actress Grace Kelly in the 1954 film Rear Window. Madonna said: [...] "I can't describe it, but that is the way I want someone to look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>when</b> he loves me. It's the most pure look of love and adoration. Like surrender. It's devastating." [...] "The Look of Love" [...] was released as the third single from the soundtrack in the United Kingdom, some European countries and Japan. [...] "I Know It", a track from Madonna's self-titled debut album, appeared as the B-side. In 1989, the song was used as the B-side for the [...] "Express Yourself" [...] single release.|$|E
500|$|Black Flag's {{change in}} musical style and {{appearance}} alienated {{many of their}} original fans, who focused their displeasure on Rollins by punching him in the mouth, stabbing him with pens, or scratching him with their nails, among other methods. He often fought back, dragging audience members on stage and assaulting them. During a Black Flag concert, Rollins repeatedly punched a fan in the face who had continuously reached for his microphone. Rollins became increasingly alienated from the audience; in his tour diary, Rollins wrote [...] "When they spit <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>when</b> they grab at me, they aren't hurting me. When I push out and mangle the flesh of another, it's falling so short of what I {{really want to do}} to them." [...] During the Unicorn legal dispute, Rollins had started a weight-lifting program, and by their 1984 tours, he had become visibly well-built; journalist Michael Azerrad later commented that [...] "his powerful physique was a metaphor for the impregnable emotional shield he was developing around himself." [...] Rollins has since replied that [...] "no, the training was just basically a way to push myself." ...|$|E

500|$|The downtempo {{song was}} {{developed}} {{on the following}} day, with Madonna writing the lyrics and Leonard composing the melody. Named [...] "The Look of Love", the song contains the line [...] "No where to run, no place to hide. From the look of love, from the eyes of pride". Madonna {{was inspired by the}} look that actor James Stewart gave actress Grace Kelly in the 1954 film Rear Window. Madonna said: [...] "I can't describe it, but that is the way I want someone to look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>when</b> he loves me. It's the most pure look of love and adoration. Like surrender. It's devastating." [...] After [...] "The Look of Love", Madonna went on to develop two further songs with Bray as the producer. The first was called [...] "Causing a Commotion", and was inspired by Penn and the couple's often tumultuous relationship. Madonna felt that her marriage to Penn {{was on the verge of}} breaking-up, due to Penn's abusive and violent nature. In a Rolling Stone article dated September 10, 1987, Madonna spoke about Penn's impact on her life and the song: [...] "I don't like violence. I never condone hitting anyone, and I never thought that any violence should have taken place. But on the other hand, I understood Sean's anger and believe me, I have wanted to hit him many times. I never would you know, because I realize that it would just make things worse. [...] I felt like he was 'Causing a Commotion' to purposefully distract me. I wrote this song and vented my frustration in it." [...] The last song developed was [...] "Can't Stop", a track inspired by Sixties Motown and the group Martha and the Vandellas. In addition to this, the album also included tracks by some acts on Warner Bros. Records, namely Club Nouveau, Scritti Politti and Michael Davidson. Commercially unsuccessful and unknown in the US, these groups needed a platform to project their songs, and including them in a Madonna album seemed like the right thing to do for Warner. Two tracks by Duncan Faure and Coati Mundi were included on the soundtrack at the request of Madonna since they were her friends. Despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album, Who's That Girl was marketed as a Madonna album, with only her face and name appearing on the cover art.|$|E
2500|$|With his {{ammunition}} expended, O'Hare {{returned to}} his carrier, and was fired on accidentally but with no effect by a [...]50-caliber machine gun from the Lexington. O'Hare's fighter had, in fact, been hit by only one bullet during his flight, the single bullet hole in F-15's port wing disabling the airspeed indicator. According to Thach, Butch then approached the gun platform to calmly say to the embarrassed anti-aircraft gunner who had fired at him, [...] "Son, if you don't stop shooting <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>when</b> I've got my wheels down, I'm {{going to have to}} report you to the gunnery officer." ...|$|E
