40|$|The Na +/H + ion-exchange {{property}} of human gastric mucus {{and its relationship}} to age has been studied. Mucus was collected from 40 postmortem human stomachs (<b>age</b> <b>range,</b> 21 - 83 years) within 24 h of traumatic death. Twenty-one stomachs (<b>age</b> <b>range,</b> 21 - 76 years) were free of Campylobacter pylori infection and histologic gastritis. Mucus from these stomachs was consistently a cation exchanger at pH 6 in an in vitro system. The cation-exchange capacity of mucus from seven stomachs within the <b>age</b> <b>range</b> 55 - 70 years was 50 % less than the cation-exchange capacity of mucus from eight stomachs within the <b>age</b> <b>range</b> 20 - 35 years.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{longitudinal}} study {{was to assess the}} relation between the transverse craniofacial dimensions of subjects with Class II, Division 1 malocclusion and the breathing mode presented by them. Forty Angle Class II, Division 1 malocclusion subjects of both genders participated in the study, 23 of which were predominantly nose breathers and 17 were predominantly mouth breathers. The mean <b>age</b> <b>ranged</b> from 10 years and 9 months to 14 years - <b>Age</b> <b>range</b> 1; and from 13 years and 4 months to 16 years and 6 months - <b>Age</b> <b>range</b> 2. Measurements of six transverse craniofacial dimensions were performed in P-A teleradiographs: Total Sphenoid, Total Zygomatic, Total Nasal Cavity, Total Maxilla, Total Mastoid and Total Antegonion. The transversal craniofacial dimensions were measured and compared in both groups at <b>age</b> <b>ranges</b> 1 and 2. The longitudinal assessment of <b>age</b> <b>ranges</b> 1 and 2 showed that there was no statistically significant influence of the breathing mode on the craniofacial dimensions evaluated, or on the alteration of these dimensions.

30|$|From Schlamersdorf at {{the river}} Trave, nine {{terrestrial}} samples, three fishbones and five food crusts on pottery were dated. The <b>age</b> <b>range</b> of terrestrial samples is very broad, about 1000 years (Figure  4). The food crusts have {{the same age as}} the terrestrial samples or are slightly older. The fishbone collagen is significantly older than the terrestrial samples. The terrestrial <b>age</b> <b>range</b> of Schlamersdorf complies with earlier charcoal dates from this site [72]. The broad <b>age</b> <b>range</b> measured here is unlikely to indicate an occupation period of 1000 years. The site was probably occupied repeatedly for shorter periods, as archaeological analysis indicated that the site was a hunting or fishing station. The broad terrestrial <b>age</b> <b>range</b> reveals the necessity of direct pottery dating: It is unclear whether the pottery from this site is associated with the older or with the younger terrestrial dates.|$|R
