The selections were made simultaneously in high and low nitrogen fertility for grain and biomass productivity. Yield trials of selected S 3 and S 4 bulks showed no advantage of selection in low fertility. These results indicate that breeding sorghum in low nitrogen fertility is not necessary; only the testing of <b>advance</b> <b>generation</b> progenies in low nitrogen environment may be sufficient {{to ensure that the}} newly selected cultivars perform reasonably' well in the low fertility environments...|$|E

40|$|Cajanus platycarpus, a distantly related wild species, was {{successfully}} crossed with cultivated pigeonpea using embryo rescue and tissue culture techniques. <b>Advance</b> <b>generation</b> lines showed {{a range of}} desirable characters including cytoplasmic male sterility. A range of pigeonpea cultivars restored fertility and was maintained by a few lines including cultivar ICPL 85010. Clasmogamous flowers were observed in the male sterile lines. In such flowers anthers did not form di-adlephous bundle. Cytological analysis revealed that meiosis proceeded normally till the tetrad stage in those anthers with pollen grains. After which many of the pollen grains turned sterile. In the anthers with pollen grains, dehiscence was not observed, thus creating functional sterility. In many other anthers, pollen mother cells (PMCs) were not formed at all, giving rise to sepalous anthers. In conclusion two mechanisms of male sterility existed, one was premeiotic, where PMCs did not form and in the second, although PMCs gave rise to pollen grains, they were either partially or totally sterile accompanied by nondehiscence of anther wall...|$|E
40|$|Cultivar {{progression}} requires {{years of}} development prior to performance trials; reducing development time requirements {{as well as}} introgression of favorable alleles {{is crucial to the}} rapid improvement of cultivars. Multi-parental <b>advance</b> <b>generation</b> intercrossing (MAGIC) can provide improved genetic mapping resolution through increased allelic diversity and higher effective recombination frequencies. The Four Parent Maize (FPM; Zea mays L.) population implements a series of the strategies used in MAGIC and bi-parental populations, creating a mapping population comprised of 1, 149 individuals with 118, 509 markers for comparison of effects on genetic mapping resolution and accuracy of quantitative trait locus (QTL) allelic estimates. Measurements were recorded for plant height (PH), ear height (EH), days to anthesis (DTA) and silking (DTS) in seven environments spanning three years. While increasing the generations of intermating prior to selection does not increase the phenotypic distribution among the dihybrid subpopulations, it does increase the mapping resolution of QTL for EH, DTA and DTS. Using association mapping software we have identified an allele from Tx 903 on chromosome 3 which decreased plant and ear height, by 4. 2 and 3. 7 cm, respectively. Additionally, an allele that decreases flowering time by one day was donated by Tx 903 and Tx 772. The detection of these QTL have previously been reported in the same region, but the allelic effect has yet to be validated. Although a single QTL was found for each quantitative trait, it is expected that many additional QTL are present; but were undiscovered due to the conservative nature of the Bonferroni multiple test correction criteria. Linkage map construction will improve estimates of the effects of multiple founders and <b>advance</b> <b>generation</b> intermating on increased effective recombination and resulting accuracy in QTL estimation and mapping resolution. Cycling of plant cells in vitro could reduce generation times required for new cultivar development. Carrot (Daucus carota) and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) species were selected for their extensive tissue culture history and high tolerance toward in vitro manipulation. Isolation of parental protoplasts from cell suspensions was followed by sorting of individual cells through fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACs); expectantly allowing for production of totipotent single cell derived colonies. Supposed colonies could be designated, with marker assisted selection for further in vitro cycling or regeneration and advancement to performance trials. Demonstrating that single cells can be isolated, can divide to form cell colonies, and can be genotyped and regenerated is central to testing the proposed hypothesis of Cycling of Gametes in Vitro (CoGiV) as conceivable. This will warrant further testing towards development of procedures intended for in vitro gametogenesis induction...|$|E

In Hong Kong, ISC, an old-generation model is recommended in the environment impact study while there is <b>advance</b> <b>generation</b> of models grown in much interest in environmental field. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate how Gaussian air dispersion models perform under Hong Kong scenario in order to find out which model would be the best candidate for replacement and at the same time provide some guidelines on applying Gaussian air dispersion models. In this study, four Gaussian air dispersion models, namely ISC 3, AUSPLUME (two old- generation models), AERMOD and ADMS (two advance models) are examined under Hong Kong meteorological conditions in two cases of study, one is the Hong Kong International Airport and the other one is the Castle Peak power plant. The results showed that these four models never agreed in the modeling results, due to various implementations of the dispersion equation and the meteorological processor. Advance models are preferred to the old ones due to better meteorological sense, discrete P-G stability class vs. continuous stability. Between the advance ones, ADMS is recommended over AERMOD due to several reasons. Firstly stability parameter estimated by ADMS’ meteorological pre-processor matched better with the observed stability than the one by AERMOD’s meteorological pre-processor, which is a crucial parameter in determining the dispersion parameters. Secondly, ADMS provides more functionality in modeling dispersion in urban region for instance setting minimum M-O length and street canyon model...|$|E

40|$|Submergence {{was a major}} {{abiotic stress}} in rice growing areas, {{particularly}} in the rainfed low land ecosystem of eastern India. Tolerance of complete submergence was recognized in some landraces and can be conferred by the Sub 1 locus in chromosome 9. Farmers’ adaptation to these landraces and previously developed submergence tolerance genotypes was poor due to either their low yield potential and/or poor grain quality. The {{purpose of this study}} was introgressing Sub 1 locus from tolerant genotype to high yielding susceptible cultivars with an aim of developing high yielding submergence tolerant genotypes with slender grain preferred by local consumer. During this study fifty lines were selected on the basis of higher yield potential from an <b>advance</b> <b>generation</b> (F 4) of a cross between a submergence tolerant, natural mutant (P- 1) and submergence susceptible rice cultivar (IR- 36). Three already established SSR Primer pairs (RM- 265, RM- 219 and RM- 464 A), linked with submergence tolerance were employed to detect polymorphism among the two parents. Only RM- 219 showed polymorphism among the parents in 2 % agarose gel and employed for screening advance rice lines. Seven lines showed similar banding pattern with tolerant parent and screened for their submergence tolerance ability in the field in controlled and submerged conditions along with the two parents. Out of seven, six lines performed well in submerged condition. Finally on the basis of yield performance as well as slenderness of grain two genotypes were selected which will be very useful source for development of additional submergence tolerant high yielding mega varieties with preferred grain type...|$|E
40|$|Pigeonpea {{occupies}} {{a prominent place}} in Indian rainfed agriculture. It is an integral component of in various agro ecologies of the country mainly inter cropped with cereals, pulses and oilseeds and millets. It {{is the second most}} important pulse crop next to chickpea, covering an area of around 4. 42 m ha (occupying about 14. 5 % of area under pulses) and production of 2. 86 MT (contributing to 16 % of total pulse production) and productivity of about 707 kg/ha. It is mainly consumed as dry split dhal throughout the country besides several other uses of various parts of pigeonpea plant. Enhancing the productivity of the crop assumes specific significance in India mainly to combat protein malnutrition as it is the main source of protein to the predominant vegetarian population. Based on the crop duration and climatic condition the crop is grouped under four agro ecological zones with varied plant type requirements and location specific constraints for each zone. Systematic crop improvement efforts were launched at ICRSIAT since its inception in 1972. It focused during first decade (1972 to 1980) on collection, evaluation, maintenance and sharing of germplasm and yield enhancement research. During 1980 to 2000 ICRISAT research priorities were development of stable sources of resistance for wilt and Sterility Mosaic Diseases which are highly devastating and endemic in India in almost all the agro ecologies of pigeonpea cultivation. From 2000, concerted efforts are in progress on CGMS based hybrid development. Spectacular achievement by ICRISAT in recent past in the crop is deciphering its genome sequence and it has ushered pigeonpea in to genomic era. Subsequently lot of genomic information {{is in the process of}} development through molecular approaches like Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS), Nested Association Mapping (NAM).

40|$|Speciation is a {{constantly}} ongoing process whereby reproductive isolating baririer build up over time until groups of organisms {{can no longer}} exchange genes with each other. Adaptation is thought {{to play a major}} role in the formation of these barriers, although the genetic mechanisms and geographic mode underlying the spread of barriers due to adaptive evolution is poorly understood. Critically, speciation may occur in stages through the formation of intermediate partially reproductively isolated groups. The idea of such widespread ecotypes has been the subject of great controversy over the last century. Even so, we have relatively little understanding about whether widespread ecotypes exist, wheather they are reproductively isolated, and how adaptive alleles are distributed among partially isolated groups. In this dissertation, I examined these issues in widespread coastal perennial and inland annual ecotypes of the yellow monkeyflower, Mimulus guttatus. First, I determined that coastal and inland populations comprise distinct ecotypic groups. I then determined that these ecotypes are adapted to their respective habitats through genetically based flowering time and salt tolerance differences. I assessed the genetic architecture of these adaptations through quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis and determined the geographic distribution of the underlying alleles through latitudinally replicated mapping populations. I quantified the contribution of these loci to adaptation in the field through the incorporation of <b>advance</b> <b>generation</b> hybrids in reciprocal transplant experiments. In the process, I discovered a widespread chromosomal inversion to be involved in the adaptive flowering time and annual/perennial life-history shift among the ecotypes. Overall, the results of this study suggest that widespread reproductively isolated ecotypes can form through the spread adaptive standing genetic variation between habitats and that chromosomal rearrangements can integral to this process.

40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii, 1960. Bibliography: leaves 78 - 82. v, 82 l mounted illus., tablesThe {{study of}} {{chromosome}} numbers of p 1. ants {{has shown the}} occurrence {{of a large number}} of natural polyploids. In :related species of plants entire series of polyploids have been revealed. Muntzing (1) indicates that at least 50 per cent and probably more of the angiosperms are polyploids and that they have played an important role in the evolution of plant species. Presumably, polyploids were able to invade new habitats because of unusual vigor, growth, and general adaptability. Plant breeders and geneticists have become aware of the increased fertility of the naturally occurring amphidiploids over their ancestral hybrids. Cytological investigations have demonstrated that many plants selected from the wild for domestication are polyploids. These were selected because of specific, superior values even though the ploidy of these plants were unknown at that time. With increased knowledge of the nature of polyploids and the realization of their importance in plant improvement programs and in genetic studies, breeders have specifically bred for polyploid types. They have concluded that in many instances polyploids are superior to their diploid counterparts in vigor, size, quality, texture, and other characteristics. In the orchid industry, polyploidy has come to assume a prominent role in the production of superior types. Kamemoto (32) has shown that the award winning Cattleya hybrids such as C. Balmar, C. Bow Bells, and C. Joyce Hannington were triploids. Storey (57, 58) and. Kamemoto (33, 34) showed that superior selections of hybrids in the vandaceous group were triploids, tetraploids, and pentaploids. Kosaki (36) working with Dendrobiums, showed that a number of superior plants were triploids and tetraploids. Polyploid plants developed in the early years of orchid breeding originated through a number of avenues. Many occurred through spontaneous doubling in the somatic tissues and non-reduction of gametes, while others were the result of polyspermy and polyploidization of gametes. Many present day <b>advance</b> <b>generation</b> hybrids are the results of hybridization of these polyploids. In the course of an extensive breeding program in orchids, relatively high sterility among intergeneric hybrids and to a lesser degree among interspecific hybrids was encountered. The cytological basis for such sterility in orchids is largely that of non-homology of the chromosomes (32, 57, 58, 33, 34). Because of the highly sterile nature of many diploid hybrids as well as triploid strains, it was found desirable to overcome this sterility barrier in order to advance the breeding program. Previous workers have demonstrated with plants other than orchids that this sterility barrier could be removed by doubling the chromosome numbers of the sterile types, and that certain chemicals such as colchicine are effective in inducing such changes. Thus far, attempts that have been made both here and in other areas indicate considerable difficulty in inducing polyploidy artificially in orchids. Furthermore, no studies have been conducted on the behavior of such induced polyploids in orchids, and very little work has been done relative to comparison of morphological differences between diploids and induced polyploids. Following upon the above considerations, the thesis as presented here involved three major objectives. The first objective was to devise practical methods for inducing polyploids in selected orchid groups by the use of colchicine. The second objective entailed the study of the characteristics of the induced polyploids, with these types being compared with their diploid counterparts in respect to morphological differences. The third objective involved an attempt to analyze and explain the induction of cytochimeras found among most of the induced polyploids...|$|E
