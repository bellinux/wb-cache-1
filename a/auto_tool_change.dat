40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the total {{tardiness}} minimization problem in a parallel machines manufacturing environment where <b>tool</b> <b>change</b> operations have to be scheduled along with jobs. The mentioned issue belongs {{to the family of}} scheduling problems under deterministic machine availability restrictions. A new model that considers the effects of the tool wear on the quality characteristics of the worked product is proposed. Since no mathematical programming-based approach has been developed by literature so far, two distinct mixed integer linear programming models, able to schedule jobs as well as <b>tool</b> <b>change</b> activities along the provided production horizon, have been devised. The former is an adaptation of a well-known model presented by the relevant literature for the single machine scheduling problem with <b>tool</b> <b>changes.</b> The latter has been specifically developed for the issue at hand.

Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 20009 Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 57 - 58. This {{thesis is}} focused on assembly line design problems in robotic cells. The mixed-model assembly line design problem that we study has several subproblems such as allocating operations to the stations in the robotic cell and satisfying the demand and cycle time within a desired interval for each model to be produced. We also ensure that assignability, precedence and tool life constraints are met. The existing studies in the literature overlook the limited lives of tools that are used for production in the assembly lines. Furthermore, the studies in the literature do not consider the unavailability periods of the assembly lines and assume that assembly lines work 24 hours a day continuously. In this study, we consider limited lives for the tools and hence we handle <b>tool</b> <b>change</b> decisions. In order to reflect a more realistic production environment, we deal with designing a mixed-model assembly line that works 24 {{hours a day in}} three 8 -hour shifts and we consider lunch and tea breaks that are present in each shift. This study is the first one to propose using such breaks as <b>tool</b> <b>change</b> periods and hence eliminate <b>tool</b> <b>change</b> related line stoppages. In this setting, we determine the number of stations, operation allocations and <b>tool</b> <b>change</b> decisions jointly. We provide a heuristic algorithm for our problem and test the performances of our heuristic algorithm and DICOPT and CPLEX solvers included in GAMS software on different instances with varying problem parameters.
