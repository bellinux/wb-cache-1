40|$|IEEE 802. 16 is {{a recent}} IEEE {{standard}} for broadband wireless access networks. In IEEE 802. 16 networks, the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol is centralized and explicitly supports quality of service (QoS). That is to say, access to the medium {{by a number of}} Subscriber Stations (SSs) is centrally controlled by one Base Station (BS), which is responsible for allocating bandwidth to several MAC connections in order to provide them with the negotiated QoS guarantees. However, although the network can be operated in Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) mode (that is, transmissions from the BS (downlink) and SSs (uplink) occur on separate frequency channels), the standard supports SSs with half- <b>duplex</b> <b>capabilities.</b> This means that they are equipped with a single radio transceiver which can be used either to transmit in the uplink direction or to receive in the downlink direction. This may severely hamper the capacity to support QoS. Therefore, in order to allocate bandwidth, an IEEE 802. 16 BS has to solve two related issues: 1) how it can schedule bandwidth grants to SSs {{in order to meet the}} QoS requirements of their connections and 2) how it can coordinate the uplink and downlink scheduled grants so as to support half- <b>duplex</b> <b>capabilities.</b> In this paper, we derive sufficient conditions for a set of scheduled grants to be allocated so that the transmission of each half- duplex SS does not overlap with its reception. Based on this, we propose a grant allocation algorithm, namely, the Half- Duplex Allocation (HDA) algorithm, which always produces a feasible grant allocation provided that the sufficient conditions are met. HDA has a computation complexity of O(n), where n is the number of grants to be allocated. Finally, we show that the definition of HDA allows us to address the two issues mentioned above by following a pipeline approach. This is when scheduling and allocation are implemented by separate and independently running algorithms, which are just loosely coupled with each other. We show via extensive simulations that the performance of SSs with half- <b>duplex</b> <b>capabilities,</b> in terms of the delay of real- time and non- real- time interactive traffic, using HDA almost perfectly matches that of full- duplex SSs, whereas an alternative approach, based on the static partitioning of half- duplex SSs into separate groups, which are allocated alternately, is shown to degrade the performance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—With recent {{advances}} in wireless systems, wireless in-band full duplex is proven possible. Prior work primarily allows a full duplex receiver to either send back a packet (bidirectional mode) or to forward another packet to its neighbor (secondary transmission). In our work, we look beyond a node pair and explore how a network can best utilize the full <b>duplex</b> <b>capability.</b> When a full duplex receiver {{does not have any}} packets to send back, concurrent transmissions (exposed transmissions) can be initiated. In a distributed channel access protocol, rapid signaling is crucial to identify the best mode for a given pair of transmitter and receiver, and to inform potential exposed terminals of transmission opportunities. In this paper, we present, RCTC, a fast and low overhead signaling mechanism based on Pseudo-random Noise (PN) sequences to enable multimodal operation of wireless links in a distributed channel access setting to support concurrent transmissions in the neighborhood. Our prototype with USRPs shows up to 78 % throughput gain. Extensive simulations over larger networks show a throughput gain of up to 131 % for RCTC over the native full duplex scheme and up to 111 % over a scheme that enables secondary transmission.

40|$|Co-primary authors This paper {{presents}} a full duplex radio design using signal inversion and adaptive cancellation. Signal inversion uses a simple design {{based on a}} balanced/unbalanced (Balun) transformer. This new design, unlike prior work, supports wideband and high power systems. In theory, this new design has no limitation on bandwidth or power. In practice, {{we find that the}} signal inversion technique alone can cancel at least 45 dB across a 40 MHz bandwidth. Further, combining signal inversion cancellation with cancellation in the digital domain can reduce self-interference by up to 73 dB for a 10 MHz OFDM signal. This paper also {{presents a}} full duplex medium access control (MAC) design and evaluates it using a testbed of 5 prototype full duplex nodes. Full duplex reduces packet losses due to hidden terminals by up to 88 %. Full duplex also mitigates unfair channel allocation in AP-based networks, increasing fairness from 0. 85 to 0. 98 while improving downlink throughput by 110 % and uplink throughput by 15 %.

We consider the scenario, {{where one of the}} receivers has a secrecy constraint and its packets need to be kept secret from the other receiver. This is achieved by employing full-duplexing at the receiver with the secrecy constraint, so that it transmits a jamming signal to impede the reception of the other receiver. In this context, the stability region of the two-user BC is characterized for the general decoding case. Then, assuming two different decoding schemes the respective stability regions are derived. The effect of self-interference due to the full-duplex operation on the stability region is also investigated. The stability region of the BC with a secrecy constraint, where the receivers do not have full <b>duplex</b> <b>capability</b> can be obtained as a special case of the results derived in this paper.

The system includes a 6. 1 meter Ku-band satellite earth station, two transportable earth stations each with a 1. 8 meter dish, and commercial modems designed for two-way timing. Elements of the facilities are described in this paper. High-accuracy timing with this equipment using the two-way time transfer technique via a geostationary satellite is d'iscussed. Phase stability measurements of ground facilities in various loop-around schemes using a satellite simulator have been performed in order to determine ultimate stability limits. Allan-variance stability plots are generated for sample times of 1 s to several days at various carrier-to-noise density (C/No) ratios. These plots are compared to theoretical limits obtained from the model of phase jitter given for the spread spectrum modem.

40|$|The {{comparison}} between the performance of both wired and wireless networks is based on various performance parameters. The performance of the wired Ethernet is very sensitive {{to the number of}} users and the offered load. When the number of users/offered load is high then the collisions increase resulting in larger wastage of the medium and lowering overall throughput. The aim of this research is to compare the throughput of LANs using Ethernet and WiFi under three different scenarios: 25, 50 and 100 users using simulator OPNET-MODELER. By analyzing the graphs, it is concluded that throughput of Wireless LAN (WiFi) is greater than that of Ethernet with operating at transmission speed of 10 Mbps when sufficient number of users are deployed that the model can support. When the number of users is increased beyond the certain limit, throughput decreases. The throughput of Ethernet and WiFi keeps on increasing and decreasing within some specific range due to the propagation delay and overhead collisions affecting at that time. The throughput is usually measured in bits per second (bit/s or bps) or in data packets per second or data packets per time slot. II.

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) nucleocapsid protein (NC) is a nucleic acid chaperone that facilitates the remodeling of nucleic acids during various {{steps of the}} viral life cycle. Two main features of NC’s chaperone activity are its abilities to aggregate and to destabilize nucleic acids. These functions are associated with NC’s highly basic character and with its zinc finger domains, respectively. While the chaperone activity of HIV- 1 NC has been extensively studied, less {{is known about the}} chaperone activities of other retroviral NCs. In this work, complementary experimental approaches were used to characterize and compare the chaperone activities of NC proteins from four different retroviruses: HIV- 1, Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV), Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV- 1). The different NCs exhibited significant differences in their overall chaperone activities, as demonstrated by gel shift annealing assays, decreasing in the order HIV- 1 RSV> MLV HTLV- 1. In addition, whereas HIV- 1, RSV, and MLV NCs are effective aggregating agents, HTLV- 1 NC, which exhibits poor overall chaperone activity, is unable to aggregate nucleic acids.

40|$|Retroviral nucleocapsid (NC) {{proteins}} are molecular chaperones {{that facilitate}} nucleic acid (NA) remodeling events critical in viral replication {{processes such as}} reverse transcription. Surprisingly, the NC protein from human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV- 1) is an extremely poor NA chaperone. Using bulk and single molecule methods, we find that removal of the anionic C-terminal domain (CTD) of HTLV- 1 NC results in a protein with chaperone properties comparable with that of other retroviral NCs. Increasing the ionic strength of the solution also improves the chaperone activity of full-length HTLV- 1 NC. To determine how the CTD negatively modulates the chaperone activity of HTLV- 1 NC, we quantified the thermodynamics and kinetics of wild-type and mutant HTLV- 1 NC/NA interactions. The wild-type protein exhibits very slow dissociation kinetics, and removal of the CTD or mutations that eliminate acidic residues dramatically increase the protein/DNA interaction kinetics. Taken together, {{these results suggest that}} the anionic CTD interacts with the cationic N-terminal domain intramolecularly when HTLV- 1 NC is not bound to nucleic acids, and similar interactions occur between neighboring molecules when NC is NA-bound. The intramolecular N-terminal domain-CTD attraction slows down the association of the HTLV- 1 NC with NA, whereas the intermolecular interaction leads to multimerization of HTLV- 1 NC on the NA. The latter inhibits both NA/NC aggregation and rapid protein dissociation from single-stranded DNA. These features make HTLV- 1 NC a poor NA chaperone, despite its robust <b>duplex</b> destabilizing <b>capability...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} hardware-software {{intercommunication}} in a reconfigurable {{system has been}} investigated based on a framework for run time reconfiguration. The goal has been to develop a fast and flexible link between applications running on an embedded processor and reconfigurable accelerator hardware in form of a Xilinx Virtex device. As a start the link was broken down into hardware and software components based on constraints from earlier work and a general literature search. A register architecture for reconfigurable modules, a reconfigurable interface and a backend bridge linking reconfigurable hardware with the system bus were identified as the main hardware components whereas device drivers and a hardware operating system were identified as software components. These components were developed in a bottom-up approach, then deployed, tested and evaluated. Synthesis and simulation results from this thesis suggest that a hybrid register architecture, a mix of shift based and addressable register architecture {{might be a good}} solution for a reconfigurable module. Such an architecture enables a reconfigurable interface with full <b>duplex</b> <b>capability</b> with an initially small area overhead compared to a full scale RAM implementation. Although the hybrid architecture might not be very suitable for all types of reconfigurable modules it can be a nice compromise when attempting to achieve a uniform reconfigurable interface. Backend bridge solutions were developed assuming the above hybrid reconfigurable interface. Three main types were researched: a software register backend, a data cache backend and an instruction and data cache backend. Performance evaluation shows that the instruction and data cache outperforms the other two with an average acceleration ratio of roughly 5 - 10. Surprisingly the data cache backend performs worst of all due to latency ratios and design choices. Aside from the BRAM component required for the cache backends, resource consumption was shown to be only marginally larger than a traditional software register solution. Caching using a controller in the backend-bridge can thus provide good speedup for little cost as far as BRAM resources are not scarce. A software-to-hardware interface has been created has been created through Linux character device driver and a hardware operating system daemon. While the device drivers provide a middleware layer for hardware access the HWOS separates applications from system management through a message queue interface. Performance testing shows a large increase in delay when involving the Linux device drivers and the HWOS as compared to calls directly from the kernel. Although this is natural, the software components are very important when providing a high performance platform. As additional work specialized cell handling for reconfigurable modules has been addressed {{in the context of a}} MPEG- 4 decoder. Some light has also been shed on design of reconfigurable modules in Xilinx ISE which can radically improve development time and decrease complexity compared to a Xilinx Platform Studio flow. In the process of demonstrating run time reconfigurations it was discovered that a clock signal will resist being piped through bus macros. Also broken functionality has been shown when applying run time reconfiguration to synchronous designs using the framework for self reconfiguration...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes {{efficient}} multiple-access {{schemes for}} large wireless networks {{based on the}} transmitters' buffer state information and their transceivers' <b>duplex</b> transmission <b>capability.</b> First, we investigate the case of half-duplex nodes where a node can either transmit or receive in a given time instant. The network {{is said to be}} naturally sparse if the number of nonempty-queue transmitters in a given frame is much smaller than the number of users, which is the case when the arrival rates to the queues are very small and the number of users is large. If the network is not naturally sparse, we design the user requests to be sparse such that only few requests are sent to the destination. We refer to the detected nonempty-queue transmitters in a given frame as frame owners. Our design goal is to minimize the nodes' total transmit power in a given frame. In the case of unslotted-time data transmission, the optimization problem is shown to be a convex optimization program. We propose an approximate formulation to simplify the problem and obtain a closed-form expression for the assigned time durations to the nodes. The solution of the approximate optimization problem demonstrates that the time duration assigned to a node in the set of frame owners is the ratio of the square-root of the buffer occupancy of that node to the sum of the square-roots of each occupancy of all the frame owners. We then investigate the slotted-time data transmission scenario, where the time durations assigned for data transmission are slotted. In addition, we show that the full-duplex capability of a node increases the data transmission portion of the frame and enables a distributed implementation of the proposed schemes.

To further characterize a subset of these proteins, recombinant Rad 51, Rad 51 B-(His) (6), and Rad 51 C proteins were individually expressed employing the baculovirus system, and each was purified from Sf 9 insect cells. Evidence from nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid pull-down experiments demonstrates a highly stable Rad 51 B. Rad 51 C heterodimer, which interacts weakly with Rad 51. Rad 51 B and Rad 51 C proteins were found to bind single- and double-stranded DNA and to preferentially bind 3 '-end-tailed double-stranded DNA. The ability to bind DNA was elevated with mixed Rad 51 and Rad 51 C, {{as well as with}} mixed Rad 51 B and Rad 51 C, compared with that of the individual protein.

These runs were designed to discern if quantitative PCR functions correctly in microgravity and if the data is comparable to that from the ground control runs. The flight data showed no significant differences compared to the ground data though there was more variability in the values, this was likely due to the numerous small bubbles observed. The capability of the system to process samples and purify RNA was then validated using frozen samples prepared on the ground. The flight data for both E. coli and mouse liver clearly shows that RNA was successfully purified by our system. The E. coli qRT-PCR run showed successful singleplex, <b>duplex</b> and triplex <b>capability.</b> Data showed high variability in the resulting Cts (Cycle Thresholds [for the PCR]) likely due to bubble formation and insufficient mixing during the procedure run.

40|$|Introduction: Paediatric duplex kidney {{is usually}} studied with 99 mTc-DMSA scan, which {{is unable to}} {{evaluate}} the hydronephrosis frequently observed in this condition, nor the wash-out from the contralateral kidney, frequently abnormal on the ultrasound scan. This study evaluates the routinary use of 99 mTc-MAG 3 diuretic scintigraphy in the diagnosis and follow-up of paediatric duplex kidney. Patients and methods: Seventy-three children were enrolled (sex F= 45, M= 28, age at first scintigraphy: median= 8. 6 months) with hydronephrosis and known/suspected duplex kidney. In 14 / 73 cases the contralateral kidney presented ultrasonographic abnormalities. Micturating cysto-uretreography was performed in all patients and an ureterocele was detected in 28 children. An endoscopic treatment was performed in 10 cases during the follow-up. All patients underwent 99 mTc-MAG 3 renal diuretic scintigraphy following the guidelines of the Paediatric Group of the EANM: controlled hydration (10 ml/kg/ 30 min), no sedation, no bladder catheter, F 20 protocol, post-void image. Differential renal function (DRF) has been calculated for every renal unit, drawing ROIs on the single moieties. Results: A duplex kidney was observed in 36 / 73 on the left side, in 18 / 73 {{on the right side}} whereas the remaining 19 children had a bilateral duplex kidney. Vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) was detected in the lower pole of 21 duplex unit and in the non-affected kidney in 10 cases. DRF in the duplex units resulted only slightly reduced (mean= 47 %), but a relevant (< 35 %) loss was already present at the first scan in 11 cases. It has been possible to evaluate the function of the single moieties in every patients in this group and the most severe reduction has been detected in the upper pole (mean= 16 % relative to total renal function). Absent or negligible function has been observed in 18 / 73 cases (3 with renographic obstructive pattern). Ureterocele was present in 13 / 18, but only in 15 / 55 patients with measurable function (p< 0. 01 Fisher exact test). Eminephroureterectomy was performed in 9 / 73 cases, based on the association of markedly reduced DRF and recurrent upper urinary tract infections. The post-operative DRF of the affected kidney remained stable. The diuretic renography excluded obstruction in all hydronephrotic contralateral kidney, supporting a conservative approach, even when pelvic and/or ureteral dilatation was marked. Conclusion: The study demonstrates the usefulness 99 mTc-MAG 3 diuretic renography in the diagnosis and follow-up of paediatric <b>duplex</b> kidney. The <b>capability</b> to evaluate the diuretic wash-out from the single moieties of the duplex units and from the contralateral kidney is a significant clinical advantage over 99 mTc-DMSA...|$|R
