Babbit was interviewed by Kirby Dick for his 2006 documentary film This Film Is Not Yet Rated. A critique of the MPAA's rating system, it suggests that films with homosexual content are treated more stringently than those with only heterosexual content, and that scenes of female sexuality draw harsher criticism from the board than those of male sexuality. It compares this movie to American Pie (also released in 1999), which features a teenage boy masturbating and was given an R rating (though American Pie also originally received an NC-17 rating and also required cuts to its masturbation scene to reduce its rating to R). Babbit says that she felt discriminated against for making a gay film. The film was rated as M (for mature audiences) in Australia and in New Zealand, 14A in Canada, 12 in Germany and 15 in the United Kingdom.|$|E

In the February 1950 General Election he was again elected at Maldon, while nationally Labour lost 68 seats, reducing its parliamentary majority to six. [...] With so small a majority, members' regular attendance in the Commons chamber became important; however, in August 1950 Driberg left the country for Korea, where Britain had joined the United States in a United Nations military expedition to repel the North Korean invasion of the South. Driberg and a few other left-wing MPs had objected to British involvement; In his Reynolds News column, Driberg had written of [...] "Tories (Conservatives) who ... cannot help baying their delight at the smell of blood in the air", <b>a</b> <b>comment</b> <b>that</b> caused outrage in parliament among the Conservative members. Whatever his reservations, Driberg's war dispatches to Reynolds News were strongly supportive of the British troops. He participated in several night operations, and won respect from many of the soldiers for his courage despite, as one Marine put it [...] "being a bit bent". He was away from parliament for three months, missing many critical House of Commons divisions, and on his return was severely censured by his fellow Labour MPs for neglecting his duties. His general standing in the party was unaffected; he had been re-elected in absentia to the NEC in September 1950.|$|E

500|$|A {{review of}} American and Pacific golden plover records was begun in 1991, {{with the purpose}} of {{evaluating}} whether any individuals previously accepted as [...] "either American or Pacific" [...] could now be definitely assigned to one species or the other (and vice versa). The results (a small {{decrease in the number of}} accepted American golden plovers, and a small increase in the number of accepted Pacifics) were published in the committee's report for 1996, with <b>a</b> <b>comment</b> <b>that</b> a detailed paper on the subject was being prepared, although as of 2009, this has not been published. A review of isabelline shrike records commenced in 1986. This review, the results of which were published in 1989, established a racial identification for a number of adult isabelline shrikes previously accepted to species level. A further review, with the same aim, was begun in the late 1990s. A preliminary set of results of this review was published in 2003; four previously accepted individuals were rejected, including one, in Cambridgeshire in 1978, which is now thought have been a hybrid with red-backed shrike. The full results of this second review were published in 2007; some of the previous racial attributions were withdrawn, but the committee felt able to confidently assign a race for a number of more recent individuals, although it stressed that this could only be done with adult birds (the committee's 2005 report mentions that a further article is in preparation). A review of black-eared wheatears was conducted in 2002–04, with the aim of assigning individuals to the eastern and western races where possible; this was possible with nine records; both western hispanica and eastern melanoleuca were shown to have occurred.|$|E
500|$|Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth {{received}} generally favorable reviews, but {{was also}} often criticized for being buggy and inaccessible for many players because of its high difficulty.

[...] According to IGN, the game [...] "succeeds brilliantly in some areas," [...] making [...] "great use of the source material" [...] and forcing players [...] "to accept some realistic responsibility for their character" [...] due to the sanity system and HUD-less display, but can make the players [...] "cringe at the difficult nature of the game." [...] Greg Kasavin of GameSpot opined [...] "a thick, unsettling atmosphere fills this ambitious first-person action-adventure, which makes up for some frustrating moments and dated graphics with plenty of chills, variety, and originality." [...] Cheat Code Central's Cole Smith called it [...] "one of the greatest book to game translations ever" [...] and a game [...] "that is full of twists, turns and incredibly wonderful scary surprises. It's got a great atmosphere which is sustained by dark and grainy graphics, chilling sound effects and an incredibly improbable storyline that is treated properly as to suspend reality from creeping in and ruining your experience." [...] GameSpy's Allen Rausch wrote [...] "this disturbing slice of Lovecraft's America is well worth the time to visit," [...] as [...] "despite the occasional missteps, Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth is a more than fitting tribute to its literary inspiration." [...] Similarly, Kyle Williams of Gaming Target called it [...] "a labor of love" [...] that [...] "defies convention in favor of creating a videogame experience that is a worthy heir to the Lovecraft name."

500|$|On January 22, 2010, Volador Jr. {{teamed up}} with El Terrible to {{participate}} in CMLL's [...] "Torneo Nacional de Pareja Increíbles" [...] ("National Amazing Pairs tournament"), a tournament where CMLL teams up a Tecnico (Volador Jr.) and a Rudo (El Terrible) for a tournament. In {{the second round of}} the tournament the team faced Averno and Místico. Initially Místico wrestle as the tecnico he has been for years, but during the match Místico's attitude seemily changed as he began attacking Volador Jr., someone he had teamed with for years. Místico even went so far as to ripping up Volador's mask, a rudo move, and won the match after an illegal low blow to Volador Jr. After the match Místico took the microphone and claimed that [...] "all was fair in war and defending Mexico City", <b>a</b> <b>comment</b> <b>that</b> drew many boos from the crowd. The two met in the main event of an Arena México show on February 5, 2010, and this time Místico was clearly a Rúdo, tearing so viciously at Volador's mask that a new mask had to be brought to the ring during falls. In the second fall Místico pulled his mask off and threw it to Volador Jr. in an attempt to get Volador Jr. disqualified. The end came when Volador Jr. reversed Místico's La Mística and won by applying the same move to Místico. Following the match Místico angrily proclaimed “¡Yo soy la máxima figura de la lucha libre!”. ("I am the greatest figure in wrestling"). On February 12, 2010, Místico lost the Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship to Volador Jr. two falls to one. On the February 26 CMLL Super Viernes show it was announced that Místico, Volador Jr., La Sombra and El Felino would face off in a four way Lucha de Apuesta match as the main event of the 2010 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas. La Sombra was the first man pinned at Dos Leyendas and El Felino was the second, forcing the two to put their masks on the line. After a long match La Sombra pinned El Felino. After the match he unmasked and announced that his real name was Jorge Luis Casas Ruiz. Following Dos Leyendas Místico announced that he was done being a rúdo and returned to the técnico side, although Volador Jr. remained suspicious of Místico. The storyline between the two cooled off for a bit, but in late May 2010, tension resumed as Místico and Volador Jr. faced off once again at the Mexican Light Heavyweight Championship, with Volador Jr. retaining the belt. At the 2010 Sin Salida the two were on opposite sides of a Relevos incredibles, Místico teamed with Máscara Dorada and Mr. Águila while Volador Jr. teamed with Averno and Negro Casas. Averno came to the ring wearing the same combined Averno/Místico mask he had worn for the Parejas Incredibles tournament and tried to convince Místico to join the rúdo side, only to turn around and reveal that both he and Volador Jr. were wearing a combined Averno/Volador Jr. mask underneath. Volador Jr. worked as a rúdo throughout the match, losing the match for his team when he tried to cheat but was caught by the referee. On July 12, 2010, at the Promociones Gutiérrez 1st Anniversary Show, Volador Jr. participated in a match where 10 men put their mask on the line in a match that featured five pareja incredibles teams, with the losing team being forced to wrestle each other with their mask on the line. His partner in the match was El Alebrije, facing off against the teams of Atlantis and Olímpico, Místico and El Oriental, Histeria and La Sombra, and Último Guerrero and Averno. Volador Jr. and El Alebrije were the second team to escape the match. In the end Místico defeated El Oriental to unmask him. After teasing a rudo turn for over a month, Volador Jr. and La Sombra lost the CMLL World Tag Team Championship to the Los Invasores team of Mr. Águila and Héctor Garza on July 23, 2010 without any signs of dissension between the two. During a later show Volador Jr. finally turned rudo when he attacked La Sombra, tore his former partner's mask off and beat him up. During the 2010 Universal Championship tournament, Volador Jr. defeated Valiente in the first round. In the second round Volador Jr. faced La Máscara and cemented his status as a rudo when he was disqualified for excessive violence against La Máscara. He kept attacking La Máscara after the match ended, leaving La Máscara an easy victim for his next round opponent, Jushin Thunder Liger.|$|E
