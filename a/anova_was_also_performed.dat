This paper focuses on determining the minimum curing time needed for Malaysian asphalt emulsions. Three factors, including curing conditions (indoor, outdoor, and curing at night), asphalt emulsion types (RS- 1 k, RS- 2 k, RS- 2 kL, RS- 3 k, Ralumac, and SRSB) and application rates (high, medium, and low), were investigated.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} used Eucalyptus oil, distilled oil from leaf of eucalyptus as an alternate fuel for diesel fuel. Generally, Eucalyptus oil possesses low cetane number {{which is not}} sufficient to operate existing diesel engine. However, this could be admissible along with diesel fuel in the form of blends. Keeping this in mind experiments have been conducted using blends of Eucalyptus oil and diesel fuel to study its replace ability, performance and emission behaviour. As the investigation involves three parameters such as blend proportion, injection timing and injection pressure, a simultaneous optimisation method called Taguchi was used in the work. This method requires fewer numbers of trials for fixing optimum levels. This is the primary advantage of this method. As per this method nine trials were experimented and its results were used for optimisation. In addition, an <b>ANOVA</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>performed</b> for the parameters to evaluate its percentage contribution over the desired output. The results of the taguchi experiment showed that the 40 Eu blend (40 % Eucalyptus oil and 60 % diesel) performed better at 29 °BTDC injection timing and at 180 bar injection pressure than other blends and had a capacity to cold start the engine. Using the optimum levels, a full range experiment was also conducted using 40 Eu blend to compare its performance and emission behaviour with standard diesel operation.

For this purpose an investigation was conducted to screen some physical (e. g. acidity, pH, density, freezing point and electrical conductivity), thermo-physical (e. g. melting temperature, heat of fusion, evaporation temperature and heat of evaporation) and chemical properties (e. g. fat%, protein%, lactose%, minerals%, SNF%) of antibiotic free milk and milk fortified by Penicillin G, Ampicillin, Tetracycline. We can able determine whether residue of antibiotics making any difference on these selected properties. Thermo-physical properties were measured by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), (TA Instruments, USA) and chemical properties were determined by using Lactostar (Funke Gerber Inc., Berlin, Germany). Antibiotic residues were detected by Copan Milk Test, Penzyme Test and ROSA Test and by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for confirmation of screening tests. Due to some drawbacks of screening tests, liquid chromatography was required for confirmation of antibiotic residues in milk. HPLC method showed that average recoveries of spiked Penicillin G at 2, 4, 8 ppb, spiked Ampicillin at 2, 4, 8 ppb and spiked Tetracycline at 100, 250, 500 ppb were ranged from 44. 67 % to 66. 00 %, from 62. 50 % to 87. 52 % and from 92. 86 % to 94. 35 %, respectively.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a {{new line}} {{symmetry}} based classifier (LSC) is proposed to deal with pattern classification problems. In order to measure total amount of line symmetry of a particular point in a class, a new definition of line symmetry based distance <b>is</b> <b>also</b> proposed in this paper. The proposed line symmetry based classifier (LSC) utilizes this new definition of line symmetry distance for classifying an unknown test sample. LSC assigns an unknown test sample pattern to that class with respect to whose major axis it is most symmetric. The mean of all the training patterns belonging to that particular class is taken as the prototype of that class. Thus training constitutes of computing only the class prototypes and the major axes of those classes. Kd-tree based nearest neighbor search is used for reducing complexity of line symmetry distance computation. The performance of LSC is demonstrated in classifying twelve artificial and real-life data sets of varying complexities. Experimental results show that LSC achieves, in general, higher classification accuracy compared to k-NN classifier. Results indicate that the proposed novel line symmetry based classifier is well-suited for classifying data sets having symmetrical classes, irrespective of any convexity, overlap and size. Statistical analysis, <b>ANOVA</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>performed</b> to compare the performance of these classifications techniques.

Relative error of simulated mean, normalized objective function (root mean square error divided by the observed mean), and index of agreement evaluation statistics were calculated to compare modeled results to observed data. A one-way, fixed-effect <b>ANOVA</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>performed</b> to determine differences among experimental locations and summit, sideslope, and toeslope landscape positions. GPFARM simulations matched observed data trends, with the model correctly distinguishing variations between the summit and toeslope landscape positions. In addition, experimental observations and GPFARM simulations both indicated that the toeslope landscape position was the most productive for grain yield and also exhibited higher amounts of crop residue, total soil profile water content, and total soil residual NO 3 -N. The GPFARM crop model performed adequately but was inconsistent in simulating winter wheat, corn, and sorghum dry mass grain yield. GPFARM performance in simulating crop residue was poorer than for crop grain yield. GPFARM predicted mean total soil profile water content was generally within Â± 20 % of the observed mean across locations and landscape positions, with the model somewhat biased towards overpredicting total soil profile water content at the summit and sideslope landscape positions. Total soil profile residual NO 3 -N was underpredicted by GPFARM across all locations and landscape positions {{by an average of}} 30 %. Although GPFARM appears to have reasonably simulated long-term output responses across a landscape catena for the eastern Colorado experimental locations (especially given the simplifying assumptions in many of the GPFARM simulation components and the inherent variability present at the experimental plot level), different interpretations of GPFARM performance can be made depending on the evaluation statistic of interest. Furthermore, the model cannot fully account for water and chemical movement across the landscape catena; simulation results suggest that addition of a spatially-distributed routing component should offer improvements in GPFARM prediction accuracy across a catena where surface runoff or lateral subsurface flow is occurring.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{characterize}} the compact bone remodeling of the ovariectomized ewe and its effectiveness as an animal model for studies of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The use of animal models is a beneficial way to evaluate the effectiveness of medical devices and therapeutic agents for treating diseases. The ovine model is an attractive option because of its large size and similar bone remodeling to humans. However, this species, like most animals, does not undergo a natural menopause, making an ovariectomy necessary for studies of estrogen depletion. The OVX (ovariectomized) sheep has been widely accepted as a model for loss of BMD. However, even with its advantages seasonality has been shown to have an effect on the bone remodeling in the ovine model. Thus, this study focused on characterizing the seasonal and anatomical variation in the compact bone remodeling in the ovine model. In doing so, 28 skeletally mature Columbia-Rambouillet cross ewes underwent an ovariectomy. The animals were divided into groups of 7 based on each season: autumn, winter, spring, and summer. During its specified season each group of 7 underwent ovariectomy and then was sacrificed 12 months post-surgery. The radii and ulnae were harvested and then divided into 6 anatomical locations: craniolateral, cranial, craniomedial, craniolateral, caudal, and caudomedial. This allowed for analysis through the fabrication of microradiographs. Histomorphometric analysis involved measurements to quantify the bone volume to tissue volume ratio, the percent of tissue and material remodeling, the mean secondary osteonal radius, and number of tissue and material cement line interfaces. Densitometry analysis was then performed to determine the density of each sector relative to an aluminum step wedge, serving as the key. Using a 2 -way repeated measures ANOVA statistical analysis was performed to evaluate for seasonal and anatomical differences as well as a possible interaction between season and anatomical region. The OVX data showed significant seasonal and anatomical differences as well as seasonality within anatomical section in the remodeling parameters. When this data was combined with earlier data from a control, sham-cohort from the same experiment a 3 -way <b>ANOVA</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>performed</b> to evaluate the effects of season, anatomical sector, and treatment on the remodeling parameters. Again, there was significant seasonal, anatomical, and treatment differences, as well as interactions of all three. The results of this study showed that varying levels of remodeling occurs in the adult OVX ovine model and differences between the control and OVX model can be attributed to seasonal and anatomical variations. Thus, it will be an important consideration when developing new test protocols for research incorporating the sheep model for studying osteoporosis...|$|E

Twenty-two subjects participated in this study, with a group of athletes (ATH: n = 11, age: 22. 1 ± 9. 9 yrs, ht: 181. 9 ± 6. 3 cm, mass: 88. 2 ± 12. 7 kg) compared to a group of non-athletes (NON: n = 11, age: 20. 9 ± 2. 3 yrs, ht: 177. 8 ± 7. 1 cm, mass: 80. 9 ± 22. 0 kg). A modified phosphate decrement test, which consisted of eight 35 m timed sprints separated by a 30 s active recovery, allowed for inducement of anaerobic fatigue while incorporating measures of sprinting performance and JS. Assessment of JS consisted of a single-legged 2. 2 Hz spring-mass hopping protocol, measured for each limb. This test was performed prior to the warm-up and after sprints two, four and six. Data analysis consisted of repeated measures MANOVA comparing groups, limbs and test. Repeated measures <b>ANOVAs</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>performed</b> on the sprint times and the magnitude of inter-limb JS difference. For all data analysis the alpha level was set at p < 0. 05. Assessment of between limb JS revealed that the ATH group possessed significantly lower inter-limb variation in comparison with the NON group after completion of the first pair of sprints, potentially due to their training status offsetting some of the mechanical and neuromuscular effects of repeated stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) fatigue. This enhanced ability to regulate inter-limb JS, in addition to enhancing performance, may reduce the risk of injury by preserving mechanical efficiency and therefore reducing metabolic cost during SSC contractions. © 2007 Sports Medicine Australia...|$|R

This retrospective crossover study is then conducted in order to investigate whether there is a change in blood pressure control after the switch. Method: Data used in this study is retrieved by CDARS (Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System), CDDH (Cooperate Drug Dispensing System) and EPR (Electronic Patient Record). 2 sided paired t-test is used to investigate whether there is a significant change in blood pressure after the switch. Moreover, subgroup analysis will <b>also</b> <b>be</b> done on the 4 different dosage subgroups. <b>ANOVA</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>performed</b> to identify any intergroup difference. Results: There are a total of 617 patients being retrieved for data analysis and 269 patients are included for data analysis. The average blood pressure before the switch is 77. 72 / 134. 61 mmHg and the average blood pressure after the switch is 77. 83 / 134. 84 mmHg and they are not statistically different (for the diastolic blood pressure, p = 0. 7619 > 0. 05 and for systolic blood pressure, p = 0. 9143 > 0. 05). The subgroup analysis results in similar findings except for the Systolic blood pressure, 20 mg lisinopril (134. 02 mmHg) performs better than 8 mg perindopril (138. 48 mmHg), p = 0. 0426 < 0. 05. ANOVA do not show any intergroup difference between the 4 subgroups. Conclusion: To conclude, the conversion table proposed in this study can be used as an initial guide for switching from perindopril to lisinopril since there is no change in blood pressure after the switch. However, close monitoring should be done in order to perform adjustment in medication if the blood pressure control is not adequate...|$|R

40|$|The {{overriding}} aim of {{this study}} was to study the relationship between corporate governance board characteristics and practices, and business performance of banks listed on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) at the end of 2013. Board characteristics investigated in this study were Board composition and diversity; Board size, meetings frequency and board membersâ€™ attendance at meetings; Chief Executive Officer (CEO) status and succession planning; and Board committees, with a particular emphasis on Audit, Remuneration and Nomination committees. Both financial and non-financial business performance measures were considered. The study sample was selected using a stratified random sampling approach. Further in pursuit of the study a quantitative research methodology was employed, utilizing both descriptive and inferential statistics in analyzing the data. For inferential statistics, correlation and regression analysis models were used. In addition, independent t-tests and analysis of variance (<b>ANOVA)</b> models <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>performed</b> on the data. The study found a significant negative relationship between all the board characteristics and practices under study and business performance. The study also found a good level of compliance with corporate governance good board practices by ZSE listed banks. Finally the study found that the identified corporate governance board characteristics and practices cannot be used as a good predictor of business performance of the ZSE listed banks. The study recommended less board diversity and fewer non-executive directors on boards. <b>Also</b> smaller boards <b>were</b> recommended together with fewer board meetings. On CEO status and succession planning it was recommended that both positions be occupied by the same person. Finally on board committees, it was recommended that ZSE listed banks have as much as possible less of such boards for enhanced business performance...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{presents}} the results of experimental investigation of semi-solid rheocasting of A 356 Al alloy using a cooling slope. The experiments have been carried out following Taguchi method of parameter design (orthogonal array of L- 9 experiments). Four key process variables (slope angle, pouring temperature, wall temperature, and length of travel of the melt) at three different levels have been considered for the present experimentation. Regression analysis and analysis of variance (<b>ANOVA)</b> has <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>performed</b> to develop a mathematical model for degree of sphericity evolution of primary alpha-Al phase and to find the significance and percentage contribution of each process variable towards the final outcome of degree of sphericity, respectively. The best processing condition has been identified for optimum degree of sphericity (0. 83) as A(3), B- 3, C- 2, D- 1 i. e., slope angle of 60 degrees, pouring temperature of 650 degrees C, wall temperature 60 degrees C, and 500 mm length of travel of the melt, based on mean response and signal to noise ratio (SNR). ANOVA results shows that the length of travel has maximum impact on degree of sphericity evolution. The predicted sphericity obtained from the developed regression model and the values obtained experimentally are found to be in good agreement with each other. The sphericity values obtained from confirmation experiment, performed at 95 % confidence level, ensures that the optimum result <b>is</b> correct and <b>also</b> the confirmation experiment values are within permissible limits.

40|$|Emphasis on {{evidence-based}} practice (EBP) {{in healthcare}} delivery increased {{the expectation that}} nurses utilize research findings to make informed clinical decisions, and guide their nursing actions and interactions with clients in a constantly changing and increasingly complex healthcare environment. Increasing demand for patient safety and quality healthcare requires that translation of best possible evidence into practice is needed to ensure improved patient outcomes. Nursing education is responsible for preparing and providing society with knowledgeable and competent nurses {{who are ready to}} engage in EBP for improved patient outcomes. The purpose of this non-experimental, descriptive, correlational, cross-sectional study was to describe and explore graduating BSN students 2 ̆ 7 self-reported EBP knowledge, EBP readiness, and EBP implementation. It also sought to explore the relationship that exists between EBP knowledge, readiness and implementation. The construct of knowledge translation (KT) provided an organizing framework for this study. Graham et al. 2 ̆ 7 s Knowledge-to-Action (KTA) Process Conceptual Framework was adapted for this study. The data collection methods and procedure consisted of survey type, self-report questionnaires administered via an electronic format through Survey Tracker. Stevens 2 ̆ 7 Academic Center for Evidence-Based Practice Evidence-Based Practice Readiness Inventory (ACE-ERI) measured EBP knowledge and readiness and the Evidence-Based Practice Implementation (EBPI) Scale by Melnyk and Fineout-Overholt was used to measure the extent of EBP implementation. Data was collected on a convenience sample of 174 part-time and full-time nursing students enrolled in the final semester for summer and fall 2010 in 24 National League for Nursing Accreditation Commission (NLNAC) and Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) accredited regular and accelerated BSN programs in Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah. Both uni-variate and bi-variate statistical analyses were used for data analysis. Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient, chi-square for independence, and multiple linear regression was performed. Additional statistical analyses to compare mean scores using the independent t -test and one-way analysis of variance (<b>ANOVA)</b> procedure <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>performed.</b> The results of this study found that graduating BSN students have beginning EBP knowledge. The respondents seem to engage in behaviors reflective of research utilization (RU) versus EBP. Clarification on how EBP is different from RU is needed. The graduating BSN students in this study reported an above average self-confidence in their EBP competencies. However, their engagement in EBP implementation behaviors is low. Refinement of EBP knowledge and skills in undergraduate nursing education is needed to assist in the acceleration of research knowledge translation to implementation in order to improve patient outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Submaximal {{exercise}} {{tests are}} being used with increasing frequency in medical and fitness fields to predict maximal oxygen uptake. As the reliability {{of these types of}} tests are not well documented, {{the purpose of this study}} was to test the reliability of the YMCA Submaximal Cycle Ergometer (YMCA) test. Sixteen male subjects, ages 17 - 26 (22. 6 ± 2. 7 yrs) performed a maximal GXT on an electrically-braked cycle ergometer and three YMCA tests on a Monark ergometer each spaced two days apart. During the YMCA test, HR was measured by telemetry; VO 2 max was predicted by both the extrapolation method (YMCAext) and use of the ACSM energy equations (YMCAACSM). Both prediction methods were compared to measured VO 2 max using repeated measures <b>ANOVA.</b> Correlational analysis <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>performed</b> to determine the reliability between submaximal tests. Measured VO 2 max was 3. 88 ±. 52 L/min (range: 2. 8 - 5. 0 L/min). In 17 of 48 trials, VO 2 max was unable to be predicted from the YMCAext using age-predicted HRmax. The YMCAACSM mean VO 2 max (4. 35 ± 1. 4 L/min) was significantly different from measured VO 2 max. Within the three YMCAACSM tests, the VO 2 max were not significantly different (4. 42 ± 1. 2, 4. 32 + 1. 8, and 4. 35 ± 1. 4 L/min, respectively). The test-retest reliability ranged between. 71 -. 75 for the three YMCAACSM tests trials. The overall CV of the YMCAACSM tests was 13. 72 ± 8. 9 % (range: 4. 12 - 40. 81). Due to the relatively modest r between measured and predicted VO 2 max and the relatively high CV for the measure, it is concluded that the VO 2 max cannot be reliably estimated from the YMCA protocol. When using this protocol to predict VO 2 max caution should be used. School of Physical EducationThesis (M. A. ...|$|R
40|$|After fire, some conifer-ericaceous plant {{communities}} in Western Europe and eastern North America have demonstrated divergent succession from traditional conifer stand replacement to Ericaceae-dominated community states. Divergence {{may be of}} function of species? responses to changes in fire severity {{as determined by the}} amount of residual organic matter (ROM) remaining after fire. ROM depth may act as an abiotic habitat filter to conifer species by physically inhibiting species establishment or through chemical afterlife effects in the unburned organic matter. If post-fire community assembly is predominantly determined by ROM depth, then post-fire species composition and their functional traits should correspond with the depth and distribution of ROM. But if species interactions are the primary constraint on community assembly, then post-fire species composition and their functional traits should be independent of the depth and distribution of ROM. I tested these predictions in black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B. S. P.) -Kalmia (Kalmia angustifolia L.) plant communities of eastern Newfoundland among three post-fire plant community types (heath, wood savannah and forest) with similar pre-fire stand types (forest). To determine if the three communities were similar prior to fire, I reconstructed stand types by sampling unburned portions of adjacent stands and by compiling pre-fire forest resource inventory data. I quantified post-fire differences in species composition by determining percent cover of all vegetation along three 20 x 1 m belt transects in replicated 20 x 20 m plots. From the species list, I compiled functional trait information from the literature for each species, and weighted traits by the total cover of species that possessed a given trait. Species and trait response (total abundance, richness and diversity) was then compared using one-way <b>ANOVA.</b> Indicator analysis <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>performed</b> to characterize species and functional traits among communities. I estimated fire severity as ROM by taking soil cores sampled contiguously in one 20 x 1 m belt transect from the replicated 20 x 20 m plots in each community. ROM was estimated by the depth of organic matter not consumed by the most recent fire under the uppermost charcoal layer. Multivariate ordination (Canonical correspondence analysis) and exponential growth and decay models were then used to test the effect of ROM on species composition and their functional traits. I found that the relative importance of abiotic and biotic filtering in post-fire community assembly was a function of ROM. When ROM was less than 2 cm, abiotic filtering favored the establishment of black spruce and other seed regenerating species, leading to black spruce recovery. When ROM was greater than 2 cm, substrate conditions and biotic interactions favored Kalmia and other vegetatively regenerating species, resulting in successional divergence. Also, when abiotic filtering was the predominant habitat constraint, it controlled species composition and functional traits directly by filtering species mode of regeneration, and indirectly through differences in the dominant species? performance between the heath and forest. The independence of species composition and functional traits to shallow ROM in the wood savannah suggests that priority effects may {{play an important role in}} determining the relative importance of abiotic vs. biotic filtering when ROM is around a threshold value (~ 2 cm) ...|$|R
