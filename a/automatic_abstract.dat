40|$|A {{critical}} component of an abstract interpretation algorithm is the abstract domain, and traditionally, it is manually defined. Recently, <b>automatic</b> <b>abstract</b> interpretation techniques have emerged. A prominent technique, called Counter Example Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), {{and is based on}} an iterative process given a target property. Beginning with an abstract domain with a low level of detail, failure to prove the property gives rise a process of abstraction refinement so that the next iteration can use a new abstract domain with a higher level of detail. The idea is to build the final abstract domain with {{just the right amount of}} detail. In this paper, we present a complementary approach: we abstract on demand, as opposed to refine on demand. Starting with no abstraction at all, our algorithm iteratively builds, if needed, abstract domains with lesser detail. We demonstrate advantages of our algorithm over CEGAR. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} design of {{cognitive}} system architecture with an internal world model. The internal world model is realized {{with the help}} of artificial mirror neurons. We consider generalized artificial mirror neurons acting both as a mechanism for assembling and learning multimodal sensorimotor information and as associative memory for invoking multimodal information given only some of its components. We show that within an artificial cognitive system a network of generalized mirror neurons can simultaneously serve as an internal world model recognized by the agent and as that of the agentâ€™s position within this world. We also specify a self-organizing control mechanism, which is based on the basic operations over concepts that were essentially identified by the British 18 th century philosopher David Hume. This control mechanism makes use of the internal world model constructed in agentâ€™s interaction with real world and straightforwardly supports imitation learning. Building heavily on the properties of the generalized mirror net and on <b>automatic</b> <b>abstract</b> concept creation, we offer an algorithmic explanation of computational language acquisition, thinking and consciousness in our model. Rather than describing an implementation of the respective mechanisms, the aim of the paper is to present a plausible hypothesis concerning the architecture and functionality of artificial systems exhibiting higher cognitive functions. 1...|$|E

Results: The main finality of the System of Indexation and Classification of Arabic Texts (SICAT) is to classify finally an unknown text in its suitable domain. So, itÂ’s to detect the text theme.

40|$|Introduction Many {{words have}} two or more very {{distinct}} meanings. For example, the word pen can refer to a writing implement or to an enclosure. Many natural language applications, including information retrieval, content analysis and <b>automatic</b> <b>abstracting,</b> and machine translation, require the resolution of lexical ambiguity for words in an input text, or are significantly improved when this can be accomplished. 1 That is, the preferred input to these applications is a text in which each word is "tagged" {{with the sense of}} that word intended in the particular context. However, at present there is no reliable way to automatically identify the correct sense of a word in running text. This task, called word sense disambiguation, is especially difficult for texts from unconstrained domains because the number of ambiguous words is potentially very large.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{describes}} {{new methods}} of automatically extracting documents for screening purposes, i. e. the computer selection of sentences having the greatest potential for conveying to the reader {{the substance of the}} document. While previous work has focused on one component of sentence significance, namely, the presence of high-frequency content words (key words), the methods described here also treat three additional components: prag-matic words (cue words); title and heading words; and structural indicators (sentence loca-tion). The research has resulted in an operating system and a research methodology. The extract-ing system is parameterized to control and vary the influence of the above four components. The research methodology includes procedures for the compilation of the required dictionaries, the setting of the control parameters, and the comparative evaluation of the automatic extracts with manually produced extracts. The results indicate that the three newly proposed com-ponents dominate the frequency component in the production of better extracts.
