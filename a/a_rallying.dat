50|$|In singles, if {{the server}} loses <b>a</b> <b>rally,</b> the service would be {{transferred}} to the opponent. If the server wins <b>a</b> <b>rally,</b> their score is increased by one point. In doubles, if the server loses <b>a</b> <b>rally,</b> the service would transfer to their partner (except if serving first in the game) presenting a second opportunity to maintain scoring (second server). If service is lost again, service is transferred to the opposition. If the server's team wins <b>a</b> <b>rally,</b> their team score is increased by one point.|$|R
50|$|For 1993, Prodrive {{recognized}} that a smaller, nimbler car {{would make a}} better platform for <b>a</b> <b>rally</b> car, and work on a Group <b>A</b> Impreza <b>rally</b> car began. It was 160 mm shorter in overall length with a 60 mm shorter wheelbase, as well as having a more neutral front/rear weight ratio. It also featured active differentials, a first for <b>a</b> <b>rally</b> car. At the 1000 Lakes Rally, Subaru debuted their new Prodrive developed Impreza derived Group <b>A</b> <b>rally</b> car, driven by Vatanen and Alén. Vatanen drove the car to second place on its debut.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>rally</b> is <b>a</b> {{period of}} {{sustained}} {{increases in the}} prices of stocks, bonds or indexes. This type of price movement can happen during either a bull or a bear market, when it is known as either <b>a</b> bull market <b>rally</b> or <b>a</b> bear market <b>rally,</b> respectively. However, <b>a</b> <b>rally</b> will generally follow a period of flat or declining prices.|$|R
5|$|The Lal Masjid siege gave hardliners in Pakistan <b>a</b> <b>rallying</b> point, {{as well as}} {{generating}} new martyrs (i.e. {{volunteers to}} commit suicide bombings) and prompting al-Qaeda, Jaish-e-Muhammad, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, and the Taliban to launch retaliation attacks in Pakistan. In the next five months suicide bombers committed 56 attacks killing 2729 Pakistanis.|$|E
5|$|The {{freedom of}} the Ionian Greeks had been <b>a</b> <b>rallying</b> cry since the {{beginning}} of the 5th century, but after the Corinthian War, the mainland states made no further attempts to interfere with Persia's control of the region. After over a century of disruption and struggle, Persia at last ruled Ionia without disruption or intervention for over 50 years, until the time of Alexander the Great.|$|E
5|$|Carlson {{and the two}} companies, with Company B leading, marched west {{towards the}} village of Asamana on the Metapona River. While {{crossing}} the river, the Marines captured two Japanese soldiers and killed a third who happened by in a native boat, then attacked and occupied Asamana, surprising and killing several Japanese soldiers in the village. Signs in Japanese in the village indicated that it was being used as <b>a</b> <b>rallying</b> location for Shōji's forces. Occupying defensive positions around the village and river crossing, the raiders killed 25Japanese soldiers that approached the village during {{the remainder of the}} day.|$|E

5|$|Parizeau's stance created {{opposition}} in the sovereignty movement, which coalesced around Bloc Québécois leader Lucien Bouchard. A popular and charismatic figure, Bouchard had come close to death from necrotizing fasciitis and lost his left leg. His recovery, and subsequent public appearances on crutches, provided <b>a</b> <b>rallying</b> point for sovereigntists and the public at large. Bouchard thought a proposal lacking a partnership would doom the project among soft nationalists (such as himself) who worried about the economic consequences of separation.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the flag was {{completed}} in two months by a committee headed by Toh. He initially wanted the flag's entire background to be red, but the Cabinet decided against this, as red was regarded as <b>a</b> <b>rallying</b> point for communism. According to an account given by Lee Kuan Yew, the Chinese population wanted five stars, which were modeled off {{the flag of the}} People's Republic of China and the Muslim population wanted a crescent moon. Both of these symbols were combined to create the national flag of Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Alligator left Matanzas on 18 November escorting her prizes {{back to the}} United States. The {{following}} day, she ran hard aground on a {{coral reef}} in the Florida Keys, which has since been named Alligator Reef. Her crew failed to refloat the vessel, but managed to salvage her guns, papers, and other valuables. Fearing {{that she would be}} salvaged by pirates, they burnt her and she sank. Though it was previously thought that the location of the wreck was known, a 1996 expedition proved this false, and the precise location of Alligator final resting place remains unknown. Allen was regarded by the Navy as a hero for his efforts against the pirates, and his name was used as <b>a</b> <b>rallying</b> cry the following year when USS Galliniper and USS Mosquito engaged and defeated a band of pirates led by Diabolito near the same area where the American lieutenant had been slain.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike {{equivalency}} frames, emphasis frames offer [...] "qualitatively different yet potentially relevant considerations" [...] {{which individuals}} {{use to make}} judgments. For example, Nelson, Clawson, and Oxley exposed participants to a news story that presented the Ku Klux Klan's plan to hold <b>a</b> <b>rally.</b> [...] Participants in one condition read a news story that framed the issue {{in terms of public}} safety concerns while participants in the other condition read a news story that framed the issue in terms of free speech considerations. Participants exposed to the public safety condition considered public safety applicable for deciding whether the Klan should be allowed to hold <b>a</b> <b>rally</b> and, as expected, expressed lower tolerance of the Klan's right to hold <b>a</b> <b>rally.</b> [...] Participants exposed to the free speech condition, however, considered free speech applicable for deciding whether the Klan should be allowed to hold <b>a</b> <b>rally</b> and, as expected, expressed greater tolerance of the Klan's right to hold <b>a</b> <b>rally.</b>|$|R
5|$|As he withdrew, Frederick {{established}} a fighting line {{north of the}} village, and it eventually served as <b>a</b> <b>rallying</b> point for stragglers and survivors. By mid-morning, around 10:00, the Prussians retreated to the north-west. Any pursuing troops were met with a wall of musket fire. Frederick and his surviving army were {{out of range of}} the Austrian army by the time they had reorganized. Hans Joachim von Zieten and Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz, who also had remained alert all night, organized a rear guard action that prevented the Austrians from falling upon the retreating Prussians. This discouraged even the most determined Austrians; the Croats and irregulars contented themselves with pillaging the village and the Prussian bodies.|$|E
5|$|George V's {{death in}} 1936 was {{followed}} by the accession of Edward VIII, who caused a public scandal by announcing his desire to marry the divorced American Wallis Simpson, even though the Church of England opposed the remarriage of divorcées. Accordingly, Edward announced his intention to abdicate; the Parliaments of the United Kingdom and of other Commonwealth countries granted his request. Edward VIII and any children by his new wife were excluded from the line of succession, and the Crown went to his brother, George VI. George served as <b>a</b> <b>rallying</b> figure for the British people during World War II, making morale-boosting visits to the troops as well as to munitions factories and to areas bombed by Nazi Germany. In June 1948 George VI relinquished the title Emperor of India, although remaining head of state of the Dominion of India.|$|E
5|$|Heydrich was interred in Berlin's Invalidenfriedhof, a {{military}} cemetery. The exact burial spot is not known—a temporary wooden marker that disappeared when the Red Army overran {{the city in}} 1945 was never replaced, so that Heydrich's grave could not become <b>a</b> <b>rallying</b> point for Neo-Nazis. A photograph of Heydrich's burial shows the wreaths and mourners to be in section A, which abuts the north wall of the Invalidenfriedhof and Scharnhorststraße, {{at the front of}} the cemetery. A recent biography of Heydrich also places the grave in Section A. Hitler planned for Heydrich to have a monumental tomb (designed by sculptor Arno Breker and architect Wilhelm Kreis) but, due to Germany's declining fortunes, it was never built.|$|E

5|$|In this programme, by {{presidential decree}} Sudirman {{was no longer}} {{commander-in-chief}} of the military starting on 2January 1948. He was demoted to lieutenant general, while Chief of the Air Force Soerjadi Soerjadarma {{was intended to be}} commander-in-chief. Shortly afterwards, Sjarifuddin was ousted in a vote of no confidence for his involvement in the Renville Agreement, and the new prime minister, Mohammad Hatta, worked to implement the rationalisation programme. This led to a several months-long debate between pro- and anti-rationalisation groups. Sudirman served as <b>a</b> <b>rallying</b> point and driving force for soldiers, including numerous older commanders, who were against the programme. Sudirman was formally reinstated on 1June 1946, upon which he effectively rescinded the command to rationalise. He chose Colonel Abdul Haris Nasution as his deputy, but remained a lieutenant general.|$|E
5|$|On 19 April 1978 a {{prominent}} leftist named Mir Akbar Khyber was assassinated {{and the murder}} was blamed on Mohammed Daoud Khan's Republic of Afghanistan. His death served as <b>a</b> <b>rallying</b> point for the pro-communist Afghans. Fearing a communist coup d'état, Daoud ordered the arrest of certain PDPA leaders, including Taraki and Karmal, while placing others such as Hafizullah Amin under house arrest. On 27 April 1978 the Saur Revolution was initiated, reportedly by Amin while still under house arrest. Khan was killed the next day along with most of his family. The PDPA rapidly gained control and on 1 May Taraki became Chairman of the Revolutionary Council, a role which subsumed the responsibilities of both president and Chairman of the Council of Ministers (literally prime minister in Western parlance). The country was then renamed the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (DRA), installing a regime that would last until April 1992.|$|E
5|$|The World Rally Championship (WRC) is <b>a</b> <b>rallying</b> series {{administrated}} by Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motorsport's world governing body. The series currently {{consists of}} 13 three-day events driven on surfaces {{that range from}} gravel and tarmac to snow and ice. Each rally is split into 15–25 special stages, which are run against the clock on closed roads. The WRC was formed from well-known and popular international rallies, most of which had previously {{been part of the}} European Rally Championship and/or the International Championship for Manufacturers; the series was first contested in 1973. The drivers' championship was first awarded in 1977 and 1978 as an FIA Cup for Drivers title, to Sandro Munari and Markku Alén, respectively. The first official world champion in rallying was Björn Waldegård in 1979.|$|E
50|$|As well as {{collecting}} signatures, {{the organization}} has held several anti-nuclear <b>rallies.</b> It held <b>a</b> <b>rally</b> of 60,000 people in Meiji Park (near Meiji Shrine), Tokyo, in September 2011, and <b>a</b> <b>rally</b> in Koriyama, Fukushima, on March 11, 2012, {{the first anniversary of}} the Fukushima nuclear disaster. On July 16, 2012, it held <b>a</b> <b>rally</b> in Yoyogi Park, Tokyo, which drew 170,000 people. It has been suggested that these anti-nuclear protests and related activities may indicate new levels of political activism from urban workers and young people.|$|R

5|$|The {{storming}} of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, {{had been}} celebrated annually since 1790, initially through quasi-religious rituals, {{and then later}} during the Revolution with grand, secular events including the burning of replica Bastilles. Under Napoleon the events became less revolutionary, focusing instead on military parades and national unity {{in the face of}} foreign threats. During the 1870s, the 14 July celebrations became <b>a</b> <b>rallying</b> point for Republicans opposed to the early monarchist leadership of the Third Republic; when the moderate Republican Jules Grévy became president in 1879, his new government turned the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille into a national holiday. The anniversary remained contentious, with hard-line Republicans continuing to use the occasion to protest against the new political order and right-wing conservatives protesting about the imposition of the holiday. The July Column itself remained contentious and Republican radicals unsuccessfully tried to blow it up in 1871.|$|E
5|$|Howard {{immediately}} sent messengers {{to summon}} reinforcements from the III Corps (Maj. Gen. Daniel E. Sickles) and the XII Corps (Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum). Howard's first XI Corps division to arrive, under Maj. Gen. Carl Schurz, was sent north {{to take a}} position on Oak Ridge and link up with the right of the I Corps. (The division was commanded temporarily by Brig. Gen. Alexander Schimmelfennig while Schurz filled in for Howard as XI Corps commander.) The division of Brig. Gen. Francis C. Barlow was placed on Schurz's right to support him. The third division to arrive, under Brig. Gen. Adolph von Steinwehr, was placed on Cemetery Hill along with two batteries of artillery to hold the hill as <b>a</b> <b>rallying</b> point if the Union troops could not hold their positions; this placement on the hill corresponded with orders sent earlier in the day to Howard by Reynolds just before he was killed.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, Savage began {{a ten-year}} stay in San Francisco. He worked {{with his father}} and brother on an iron foundry enterprise, and served two years as colonel of the 2nd Regiment California National Guard. Savage took a {{prominent}} role in the civic and social life of the city, and was often called upon to make extemporaneous speeches to large crowds, a skill on which politician and economist Henry George complimented him. In January 1878, Savage served as chief military executive officer of the Committee of Safety, a group set up to oppose Denis Kearney and his riotous mob of angry supporters who {{wanted to get rid of}} Chinese immigrants. Savage's calm and logical presence was seen by San Franciscans as <b>a</b> <b>rallying</b> point for law and order during the riots. Savage renewed the friendship of his childhood schoolmate, now Bohemian Club poet Charles Warren Stoddard. He made the acquaintance of writer Archibald Clavering Gunter, who would later publish some of Savage's stories.|$|E
