40|$|International audienceOur goal is {{to develop}} a {{complete}} and <b>automatic</b> <b>scanning</b> strategy of unknown objects. The paper presents a novel approach to determine the Next Best View for an efficient reconstruction of highly accurate 3 D models. Our method is based on the classification of the acquired surfaces into Well Visible and Barely Visible combined with a best view selection algorithm based on mean shift, which avoids unreachable positions. Our approach is applicable to all kinds of range sensors. Test objects are first scanned manually by experts in 3 D digitization from the VECTEO company. The comparison of results between manual and <b>automatic</b> <b>scanning</b> shows that our method is very efficient and faster than trained experts.
