5|$|In 1911, the New York State Legislature created Route46, an {{unsigned}} legislative route {{extending from}} Coopers Plains in Steuben County to Trumansburg in Tompkins County via Watkins Glen. East of Watkins Glen, Route46 proceeded generally northeastward through Burdett, Reynoldsville and Mecklenburg {{on its way}} to Trumansburg. On March1, 1921, the Route46 designation was reassigned to another highway in Allegany and Steuben counties as part of a partial renumbering of the legislative route system.

5|$|The routing of US-64 was {{modified}} further on July 6, 1965, {{through the city}} of Enid.

The Oklahoma Department of Highways approved a rerouting of the designation onto a freeway south of Muskogee on October 3, 1966, and a relocation slightly to the north between Jamesville and Muskogee on July 10, 1967. However, neither of these modifications was completed until around 1969. Then, on June 1, 1970, US-64 was relocated across the Arkansas River between Webber Falls and Gore.
