After <b>a</b> few <b>tenths</b> of <b>a</b> mile, it turns west and receives the tributary Falls Creek from the [...] The creek then turns south-southwest for more than a mile and its valley broadens. It then turns south-southeast for <b>a</b> few <b>tenths</b> of <b>a</b> mile before turning south-southwest for <b>a</b> few <b>tenths</b> of <b>a</b> mile. At this point, the creek turns west.

5|$|Bolt {{was less}} {{challenged}} in the 200m final. His closest rival was Jamaican champion Warren Weir but Bolt ran {{a time of}} 19.66 to finish over <b>a</b> <b>tenth</b> of a second clear. This performance made Bolt the first man {{in the history of}} the 200 metres at the World Championships in Athletics to win three gold medals over the distance.|$|E
5|$|Bolt went undefeated over 100m and 200m in the 2011 season. He {{began with}} wins in Rome and Ostrava in May.

Two further 200m wins came in Paris and Stockholm the {{following}} month, as did a 100m in Monaco, though he was <b>a</b> <b>tenth</b> of a second slower than compatriot Asafa Powell before the world championships.|$|E

5|$|Common {{over most}} of its range in woodland, the common {{blackbird}} has a preference for deciduous trees with dense undergrowth. However, gardens provide the best breeding habitat with up to 7.3 pairs per hectare (nearly three pairs per acre), with woodland typically holding about <b>a</b> <b>tenth</b> of that density, and open and very built-up habitats even less. They are often replaced by the related ring ouzel in areas of higher altitude.. The common blackbird also lives in parks, gardens and hedgerows.|$|E
5|$|If the {{designated}} hitter (DH) rule is in effect, each team has <b>a</b> <b>tenth</b> player whose sole {{responsibility is to}} bat (and run). The DH {{takes the place of}} another player—almost invariably the pitcher—in the batting order, but does not field. Thus, even with the DH, each team still has a batting order of nine players and a fielding arrangement of nine players.|$|E
5|$|In {{supporting}} Octavian, Antony {{expected to}} gain {{support for his}} own campaign against Parthia, desiring to avenge Rome's defeat at Carrhae in 53BC. In an agreement reached at Tarentum, Antony provided 120 ships for Octavian to use against Pompeius, while Octavian was to send 20,000 legionaries to Antony for use against Parthia. Octavian sent only <b>a</b> <b>tenth</b> of those promised, however, which Antony viewed as an intentional provocation.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} session of Friday afternoon, Nico Rosberg topped the timesheets, setting a time of 1m41.983s, {{finishing}} more than <b>a</b> <b>tenth</b> of a second ahead of Hamilton. Third fastest was Sergio Pérez for Force India, although {{he was unable to}} run in the last twenty minutes of the session due to brake issues. The Red Bull drivers Kvyat and Ricciardo were fourth and sixth respectively, while Fernando Alonso came within one second of Rosberg's time in ninth.|$|E
5|$|Lacaille gave nine stars Bayer designations, {{labelling}} them Alpha {{through to}} Theta, including two stars {{next to each}} other as Zeta. Gould later added <b>a</b> <b>tenth,</b> Iota Antliae. Beta and Gamma Antliae (now HR 4339 and HD 90156) ended up in the neighbouring constellation Hydra once the constellation boundaries were delineated in 1930. Within the constellation's borders, there are 42 stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude6.5.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton {{topped the}} time sheets in Saturday's free {{practice}} session, with Sebastian Vettel <b>a</b> <b>tenth</b> {{of a second}} behind, while Rosberg and Räikkönen completed the top four.

5|$|Nine of Milwaukee Avenue's houses {{had to be}} {{destroyed}} due to their decrepit conditions and <b>a</b> <b>tenth</b> was moved elsewhere. In the spaces where these houses once stood, townhomes were built, mirroring {{the style of the}} original houses. The rest of the houses got indoor plumbing, new basements, improved woodwork and porches added on. Additionally, a pedestrian mall was built down the center of Milwaukee Avenue to replace a one-way street. The Avenue is now bike and pedestrian friendly, and cars are prohibited.|$|E
5|$|The {{registers}} of Crosthwaite Church {{stated that}} there were 238 interments in 1623, {{believed to have been}} something between a twelfth and <b>a</b> <b>tenth</b> of the whole population of the parish at that time. In the 1640s there was a sharp fall in population, brought on by the plague epidemic which affected Keswick, Carlisle, Cockermouth and Crosthwaite and other areas in 1645–47.|$|E
5|$|The {{sizes of}} both moons are {{calculated}} {{with the assumption}} that they have the same infrared albedo as Haumea, which is reasonable as their spectra show them to have the same surface composition. Haumea's albedo has been measured by the Spitzer Space Telescope: from ground-based telescopes, the moons are too small and close to Haumea to be seen independently. Based on this common albedo, the inner moon, Namaka, which is <b>a</b> <b>tenth</b> the mass of Hiʻiaka, would be about 170km in diameter.|$|E

It then reaches its confluence with Bowman Creek.|$|R

5|$|The unit {{structure}} of the Auxilia also differed from the Latin alae, which were like legions with a larger cavalry arm. Augustus however organised the Auxilia into regiments the size of cohorts (<b>a</b> <b>tenth</b> the size of legions), due to the much greater flexibility of the smaller unit size. Further, the regiments were of three types: ala (cavalry), cohors (peditata) (infantry) and cohors equitata (mixed cavalry/infantry).|$|E
5|$|Written by Roger Dixon, {{this story}} was {{submitted}} on January 16, 1967. The basic story idea had the TARDIS bring the Doctor and his companions to the Nevada Desert, where they discover they have been shrunk to <b>a</b> <b>tenth</b> of an inch in height. To make matters worse, they learn that the local ants have been made super-intelligent by atomic bomb tests and plan {{to take over the}} Earth.|$|E
5|$|After Lieder, {{the first}} person to {{propagate}} her Planet X idea was Mark Hazlewood, {{a former member of the}} ZetaTalk community, who in 2001 published a book titled Blindsided: Planet X Passes in 2003. Lieder would later accuse him of being a confidence trickster. A Japanese cult called the Pana Wave Laboratory, which blocked off roads and rivers with white cloths to protect itself from electromagnetic attacks, also warned that the world would end in May 2003 after the approach of <b>a</b> <b>tenth</b> planet.|$|E
