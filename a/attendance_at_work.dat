Public Health England (PHE) wants all hospitals to help smokers quit. One in thirteen smoking patients was referred to a hospital or community based cessation programme. Over a quarter of patients were not asked if they smoke and nearly three quarters of smokers were not asked if they wanted to stop. Half of frontline hospital staff were offered no training in smoking cessation. Smoking patients should be offered specialized help to stop and nicotine replacement. There should be dedicated staff helping patients to quit. Seven tenths of smokers say they want to stop and those offered help are four times more likely to stop permanently. PHE claims smoking causes 96,000 deaths per year in England and twenty times the number of smoking related illnesses. Dr Frank Ryan, psychologist said, [...] "It's really about refocusing our efforts and motivating our service users and staff to quit.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to identify predictors of poor occupational functioning (OF) in individuals with bipolar disorder (BD). This investigation involved three distinct, but related studies. The first study investigated the effects of clinical, demographic and neurocognitive features on OF in individuals with BD. Previous work found that as depression and neurocognitive deficits increased, OF decreased. However, few studies have examined these features over time using distinct aspects of work functioning. This study employed multilevel modeling (MLM) to determine which demographic, clinical and neurocognitive characteristics influence 4 aspects of work functioning over 5 years: attendance, conflict, enjoyment, performance. Those with higher levels of depression were more likely to experience difficulties in all work domains that persisted over the entire 5 years. The second study investigated the influence of interpersonal features of individuals with BD on OF. Prior work has typically investigated traditional features of BD (e. g., clinical, neurocognitive) overlooking interpersonal characteristics. This study employed MLM to determine which demographic, clinical and interpersonal characteristics (i. e., personality, impulsivity, hostility, social anxiety) of individuals with BD affect work functioning across 5 years. Those with higher levels of depression were more likely to experience impairments related to work attendance, conflict with coworkers and supervisors, quality of work and enjoyment from work. At baseline, higher levels of mania were associated with improved <b>attendance</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> Yet over time, mania negatively affected overall work functioning, <b>attendance</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> and work performance. Prior work on OF focuses mainly on the individual’s features of BD neglecting the environment. The third study took a novel approach and evaluated the relationship between social aspects of the work environment and work outcomes among individuals with BD. This study employed regressions in order to determine which demographics, mood symptoms and aspects of the work environment (i. e., conflict, exclusion, social support, stigma) predict work status and work functioning for individuals with BD. Exclusion and stigma at work predicted unemployment, whereas depressive symptoms and conflict at work predicted poorer work functioning. Taken together, this dissertation aims to inform approaches to remediating poor OF ultimately improving the overall functioning of individuals with BD...|$|E
30|$|Despite {{all of the}} above, {{few studies}} have {{assessed}} biological rhythms in remitted bipolar patients (Brill et al. 2011; Harvey et al. 2005). In addition, most of them investigated sleep function exclusively, failing {{to take into account}} the other sensible areas involved in biological rhythms (Gruber et al. 2009; Sylvia et al. 2012). For instance, one study compared bipolar I disorder patients (n= 19) with age- and gender-matched healthy controls, reporting that affected individuals presented higher sleep abnormalities in both objective (actigraphy) and subjective measures than healthy control participants (Millar et al. 2004). There is increasing evidence, however, that social rhythms, defined by <b>attendance</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> engagement in social activities or recreation, and exercise, may affect circadian regularity as a greater variability of social activities has been consistently related to sleep disturbance (Carney et al. 2006; Morgan 2003).

40|$|Purpose –  The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the role of line managers in managing <b>attendance</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> in the lean regime of grocery retailing. The increasing competitiveness within the sector, coupled with the sophisticated control systems in place put pressure on managers to keep labour costs low. Attendance, therefore, becomes a critical factor, particularly as staffing levels become leaner. Taking this into account, it is necessary to understand the parameters of the line managers’ role in managing attendance, especially within the lean food retail market and the antagonistic terrain of the supermarket shop floor. The paper discusses the impact of lean retailing on line managers’ authority and provides a fresh sociological analysis regarding their role in managing attendance, offering insights into managerial practices on the UK supermarket shop floor. Design/methodology/approach – The paper draws on qualitative research evidence from two case study grocery retail organizations in the UK. It reports on 44 semi-structured interviews and provides a multi-level analysis aiming to understand the different perspectives on the problem examined.   Findings – The paper reveals the existence of a centralized absence management policy and highlights the greater involvement of line managers in this procedure. Line managers though were subjected to forces of bureaucratic control, intensification and degradation of their work. Despite having an active role within the attendance management process and high responsibility for the implementation of rules and procedures handed down by head office, they had limited authority over the process. Line managers perceived the latter as routine and a box-ticking exercise and had developed coping tactics to deal with the control from above.   Originality/value – This paper provides practical and theoretical considerations over the role of line management in the labour process, investigating their role in managing <b>attendance</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> within the lean terrain of food retailing. This research contributes to the ongoing academic discussions related to the devolvement of HR responsibilities to the line, highlighting the great involvement of line managers in the absence policy. It also provides a sociological perspective over line managers’ authority and discretion in managing attendance, revealing that they were subjected to direct and bureaucratic control within their role in attendance management. However, the research reveals that line managers were not passive in the face of direct control from above and had developed tactics to cope with the monotony and the repetition of this process, attempting to somehow escape the top-down control they were subjected to...|$|E

Their research is drawn primarily from the British experience, but the phenomena studied are international in scope. Generally, civic engagement has been improving, but in certain areas there are serious gaps that still need addressing. Administrative arrangements are shown to reduce absence for booked appointments, without necessarily making referred patients more or less likely to attend. A variety of measures are suggested for truancy, and the take-up of social security benefits faces a number of issues. Work absence attributed to sickness is at least partly viewed as a psychosocial problem. Economic analysis shows the importance of incentives, and the potential cost of changing from selective to the universal provision of free school meals.

40|$|Absenteeism {{control is}} a {{paradigm}} in human resource units of organizations that involves the administration of employees’ obligation to maintain regular <b>attendance</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> and corporate events. This managerial control measure is not only obtainable in the industry but also, it attracts {{a lot of attention}} in the academic and government establishments. Widespread absence from work by employees can culminate in disruption, low efficiency and reduced productivity in any organisation. Also, absenteeism from school or class always has detrimental effects on the students’ academic performance and attitudinal development. RFID technology is currently been adopted by researchers to implement absenteeism control for organisations. However, most existing technologies utilise single frequency RFID reader with connection via USB to a PC that runs stand-alone software. This kind of framework usually imposes huge installation cost and all the inherent flaws in a stand-alone software architecture. In this work, we designed and constructed a dual band RFID module that incorporates 125 kHz reader and 13. 56 MHz reader/writer. The module connects directly via a Wi-Fi network to an intranet PC which functions as the Server on which we installed the Web-based Attendance Management Software (WAMS) developed in this work. One of the primary objectives of developing WAMS is to achieve client-server architecture for electronic-based attendance management. Employees or Students with either low or high frequency RFID smart card can sign-in and out by placing the card close to our dual frequency module. We tested the newly developed platform and obtain very promising results. The hardware and software are fully read...|$|E

40|$|Absenteeism is {{a serious}} problem which affects the profitability, {{competitiveness}} and productivity of industry. Costings of absenteeism in the U. K. are estimated at 11 billion pounds per annum. (Seacombe, 1995 : 26). Irish business loses hundreds of millions of pounds each year as a result of employee absenteeism. In 1992 the direct cost to industry in Ireland was £ 575 million. (I. B. E. C., 1993 : 1) These significant costs represent direct costs only and take no account of indirect costs, such as cost of lost sales, replacement human resources and overtime to cover the absentees. Industry can no longer afford unnecessary absenteeism. Absences from the workplace pose practical problems not only for industry but for the economy as a whole. This requires examination and diagnosis. Unless an organisation is overstaffed, the absence of an employee will result either in a loss of production or else impose an additional strain on those present. Therefore, the control of absenteeism within an organisation is vital {{in order to ensure that}} the organisation remains profitable, competitive and reaches its maximum productivity potential. A survey of literature indicates that absenteeism levels will decline if attendance control strategies are in place. (Edwards and Whitson, 1995 : 5). This study proposes to test the hypothesis that effective management of <b>attendance</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> will reduce or eliminate unnecessary absenteeism. Furthermore recent research in the topic area has purported to contain the causes for absenteeism in the workplace.

40|$|Two summer {{outbreaks}} of humidifier fever (HF) {{are described in}} a microprocessor factory (factory A) and a printing factory (factory B). The air in each factory was humidified intermittently and controlled by present humidistats operating to maintain a relative humidity of 45 % by an air handler incorporating a spray humidifier in factory A and two ceiling mounted spray humidifiers in factory B. Questionnaire data from each workforce suggested that although symptoms apparently occurred most commonly in both factories on return from holiday (41 / 57, 71. 9 %), many subjects (24 / 40, 60 %) in factory A also had intermittent symptoms of ill defined periodicity for some time before the disorder was recognised. Similar intermittent symptoms with no discernible pattern occurred in factory B in {{a smaller number of}} subjects (4 / 17, 23. 5 %), all of whom were night or rotating shift workers. Both episodes of humidifier fever after return from summer holiday developed when nocturnal air temperatures were unseasonably low; not on the day of return to work but two days later (factory A) and one day later (factory B). Symptoms were most common in most workers who had circulating serum IgG antibody measured by ELISA to humidifier sludge in factory B (14 / 17, 82. 9 %) but were most common in IgG antibody negative subjects in factory A (27 / 40, 67. 5 %). A more classic form of humidifier fever redeveloped in factory B during winter when meteorological recordings suggested that humidification of intake air was more continuous. Humidifier fever in winter may have been the major influence on the formulation of the symptom pattern thought to be relevant for recognition of the disorder. A form of the illness, however, can occur during the summer which is camouflaged by intermittent humidification when the symptoms appear to be more closely associated with cool nocturnal air intake and unrelated to the pattern of <b>attendance</b> <b>at</b> <b>work...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} chapter of this dissertation, I study the {{introduction}} of a bonus scheme with lottery payoffs at a large agricultural firm in Malawi. The “lottery bonus” was motivated by evidence from lab studies and by real world behavior that suggests that people often become risk-seeking when faced with small chances of large gains. Attendance- and performance-based bonuses were introduced for over 1, 600 piece-rate workers. <b>Attendance</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> was higher under both schemes and that the effect of the lottery bonus on the probability of full weekly attendance was about twice as large as the effect of the fixed bonus. The larger effect on attendance appears to persist over time as workers gain experience with the lottery distribution. The second chapter, written jointly with Jason Kerwin, reports results from a field experiment with casual workers in Malawi designed to investigate how income timing and temptation affects spending decisions. Despite anecdotal evidence and suggestive survey data that in this study’s context market days increase the temptation to overspend, being paid {{at the site of the}} local market on Saturday compared to Friday did not strongly matter for expenditure levels or temptation spending. However, workers in the monthly group are much more likely than the weekly payment group to invest in a risk-free short-term “bond” that required a large payment and that was offered by the project in the week after the last payday. The third chapter, written jointly with Xavier Giné, Jessica Goldberg and Dean Yang, describes the results of a field experiment among Malawian farmers aimed at facilitating formal savings for agricultural inputs. Treated farmers were offered the opportunity to have their cash crop harvest proceeds deposited directly into new bank accounts in their own names, while farmers in the control group were paid in cash. The treatment led to higher savings and raised agricultural input usage. Because the treatment effect on savings was only a small fraction of the treatment effect on the value of agricultural inputs, mechanisms other than alleviation of savings constraints per se are needed to explain the treatment’s impact on input utilization...|$|E

40|$|Attendance in the {{workplace}} is becoming a growing challenge for companies or organisations in general. Non-attendance has become a world-wide or international problem. According to Banks, Patel and Moola (2012) {{it is a common}} problem in all types of industries, minor or large, private or government. South African organisations are losing estimated billions of rand in cost annually due to poor attendance. These costs are having a negative effect on organisations’ revenue, effectiveness, health and safety. A satisfactory level of employee <b>attendance</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> is necessary to allow departments within organisations to achieve their objectives and targets. Research suggests many factors which influence employee attendance and these are investigated, analysed and discussed within this study. The aim {{of the study was to}} attempt to improve attendance at an automotive manufacturing company by investigating the influences of certain elements, namely motivation, leadership (supportive), job satisfaction and rewards. The literature study was done to investigate the relationship between these factors and elements and attendance. Through research the realisation of the importance of controlling absenteeism has become very imminent. The literature review has shown that these factors are related to attendance, some of them influencing the tendency to attend work positively and others having a negative influence causing employees to be absent from work. The study also investigates some of the common possible reasons and motives for non-attendance. The empirical part of the study was to determine the perception of workers with regard to attendance. A convenience sampling method was used to select the respondents and the size of the sample consisted of 198 respondents. A researched and well-designed questionnaire was used to gather the data. The information was analysed with the latest statistics software package. Independent tests and analysis of various techniques were used to determine the statistical significant differences in the relationship between attendance and the elements with regard to employee perception. These perceptions were grouped in biographical categories, namely race, age, shop, service length, marital status, gender, income and the number of days absent in the last three years. Through the study statistically no actual significant difference was found among these groups. The key findings within this study show that there are no significant relationships between the dependent variable (attendance) and the independent variables, (motivation, leadership, job satisfaction and rewards). This relation is highlighted by the statistical data which is discussed and analysed individually for this study The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed and recommendations based on these findings are provide...|$|E
