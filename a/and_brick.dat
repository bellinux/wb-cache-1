5|$|A {{gauging station}} was {{constructed}} on Buffalo Creek near Lewisburg in September 1913. In the early 1900s, the main {{industries in the}} creek's watershed included agriculture, furniture factories, flour mills, <b>and</b> <b>brick</b> works. The tributary Spruce Run was also used as a water supply by the White Deer Mountain Water Company and the main stem was used as power for some small gristmills. During this time period, major communities in the watershed included Lewisburg (3085 people), Mifflinburg (1559 people), Mazeppa (185 people), Cowan (150 people), Buffalo Roads (142 people), and Kelly Point (97 people). The Pennsylvania Railroad also went through {{the southern part of}} the watershed during the early 1900s.|$|E
5|$|Both of {{the country}} club's Route 9 entrances have a gatehouse. Both are small, two stories high, three bays wide, and one bay deep, and were {{constructed}} along with {{the house in the}} 1890s. The gatehouses resemble Woodlea in materials and simplified stylistic detail. Both gatehouses have gable roofs and a shed-roofed one-story high rear addition. The houses have stone <b>and</b> <b>brick</b> pedimented porticos over their entranceways. The lower-level windows have flat-arched surrounds with keystones; the oculi break the cornice lines beneath segmentally arched pediments. The northern gatehouse has another one-story rear addition and a small one-car garage. The club's two tall gateways are made of French-imported carved stone and ironwork.|$|E
5|$|Hillsboro's Civic Center is {{a modern}} glass {{building}} with a stone base <b>and</b> <b>brick</b> highlights. There are two main buildings, the Civic Center housing government offices and the Plaza Building housing retail space. The plazas surrounding the structures contain an inlaid quartzite river, basalt planters, and Victorian style benches. Additionally, it was designed with large windows facing the north in order to reflect the giant sequoia trees located {{across the street at}} the Washington County Courthouse, with the trees dating back to the 1880s.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th century, Thomas John Newbold, an English soldier {{working for}} the East India Company, {{estimated}} the population of Kuala Terengganu to be around 15,000 to 20,000 Malays with 600 Chinese, but it was presumably an overestimation. There were few brick buildings in the town. The principal brick buildings were a mosque and a custom house. Most of the houses were made of wood and thatch. The Chinese settlement in Kuala Terengganu, Kampung Cina, had become an old and established settlement. Most of the houses and shops in Kampung Cina were made of stone <b>and</b> <b>brick.</b> There were also {{a considerable number of}} Arabs and their descendant in Kuala Terengganu.|$|E
5|$|Marvin {{spent five}} months {{scouting}} prisons across the United States and Canada, {{looking for a}} site that had a timeless aesthetic, and was completely abandoned, hoping to avoid the complexity of filming the required footage, for hours each day, in an active prison with the security difficulties that would entail. Marvin eventually chose the Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio {{to serve as the}} fictional Shawshank State Penitentiary in Maine, citing its Gothic-style stone <b>and</b> <b>brick</b> buildings. After nearly a century of use, the facility had been closed three years earlier on New Year's Eve, 1990, due to inhumane living conditions.|$|E
5|$|No.106, on {{the corner}} of Piccadilly <b>and</b> <b>Brick</b> Street was built for Hugh Hunlock in 1761. It was {{subsequently}} owned by the 6th Earl of Coventry who remodelled it around 1765; most of the architecture from this renovation has survived. In 1869, it became home to the St James's Club, a gentleman's club which stayed there until 1978. The building is now the London campus of the Limkokwing University of Creative Technology.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study aims to {{investigate}} the relationships between Schmidt hardness rebound number (RN) and ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) versus compressive strength (fc) of stones <b>and</b> <b>bricks.</b> Four types of rocks (marble, pink lime stone, white lime stone and basalt) and two types of burned <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> lime-sand <b>bricks</b> were studied. Linear and non-linear models were proposed. High correlations were found between RN and UPV versus compressive strength. Validation of proposed models was assessed using other specimens for each material. Linear models for each material showed good correlations than non-linear models. General model between RN and compressive strength of tested stones <b>and</b> <b>bricks</b> showed a high correlation with regression coefficient R 2 value of 0. 94. Estimation of compressive strength for the studied stones <b>and</b> <b>bricks</b> using their rebound number and ultrasonic pulse velocity in a combined method was generally more reliable than using rebound number or ultrasonic pulse velocity only...|$|R
5|$|Richard was {{a sickly}} child and his parents' reduced {{circumstances}} meant that his education was somewhat sporadic. In {{his early years}} he wandered through the fields <b>and</b> <b>brick</b> yards where he lived, picking wildflowers. His favourites were Germander Speedwell, Creeping Tormentil and Common Chickweed. At {{the age of twelve}} he was apprenticed to a bat maker (the maker of children's small leather shoes) named James Heap, in Port Street, Manchester. About 18months later he went to work with James Hyde, with whom he stayed for a number of years.|$|E
5|$|Rounded arches, vaults, and domes {{distinguish}} Roman architecture {{from that}} of Ancient Greece and were facilitated {{by the use of}} concrete <b>and</b> <b>brick.</b> By varying the weight of the aggregate material in the concrete, the weight of the concrete could be altered, allowing lighter layers to be laid at the top of concrete domes. But concrete domes also required expensive wooden formwork, also called shuttering, to be built and kept in place during the curing process, which would usually have to be destroyed to be removed. Formwork for brick domes need not be kept in place as long and could be more easily reused.|$|E
5|$|St Saviour's Church {{served the}} southwestern part of Round Hill until 1981. The flint <b>and</b> <b>brick</b> building, set {{below the level}} of Ditchling Road and on its west side, was in the Early English Gothic Revival style and was meant to have a tower; only a stub was ever built. The architects were Edmund Scott and F.T. Cawthorn. An {{extension}} was built in 1889, and in 1904 a large reredos designed by Richard Herbert Carpenter and W. Slater was moved to the church from Chichester Cathedral. Congregations declined, and the church was demolished in 1983; flats called St Saviour's Court and a rear archway in Vere Road recall its existence.|$|E

Manila has endured several deadly earthquakes, notably in 1645 and in 1677 which destroyed the stone <b>and</b> <b>brick</b> medieval city. The Earthquake Baroque style was used by architects during the Spanish colonial period in order to adapt to the frequent earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|Tensions eased when Beth Israel hired {{its first}} Rabbi, the Reverend L. Winter, in 1870. He moved the {{congregation}} towards Reform Judaism, replacing Saturday services with Friday night ones, giving sermons in English, and adding confirmation ceremonies. However, Winter left soon afterward. Beth Israel's building burned down in 1874, {{and was replaced}} by a stone <b>and</b> <b>brick</b> building at the same location. In 1875 Beth Israel formalized its move to Reform by joining the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now Union for Reform Judaism).|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church, whose {{traditional}} membership {{was most}} affected by the changes in housing, {{was the first to}} react to this situation, creating 76 new parishes between 1845 and 1960 in the west of the country alone. The Baptist and Episcopalian churches followed close behind, particularly in the new towns. Within the Church of Scotland, the closeness of congregation and clergy was expressed in the domestic plainness of 1950s dual-use hall churches, as at Reiach's Kildrum Parish Church, Cumbernauld (completed 1962), a steel framed building, clad in timber <b>and</b> <b>brick</b> with a flat roof. Of 129 buildings erected by the Church of Scotland between 1948 and 1959, 108 were on this basic pattern.|$|E
