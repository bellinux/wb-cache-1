40|$|The {{wind regime}} of the Lake Tekapo Basin is {{examined}} {{with reference to}} the interaction of multi-scale local, regional and synoptic circulations. Analysis of the historical wind direction record from Mt John identifies airflow from three principal directions to most frequently affect the study area. Both seasonal and diurnal trends in the frequency of each directional category are identified, which reflect the influence of local thermal forcings and seasonal changes in synoptic circulation on the Lake Tekapo windfield. Meteorological observations from a network of automatic weather stations and <b>anemographs</b> within the study area identified Lake Tekapo to generate its own circulation system, a lake/land breeze. This combines with the larger scale valley wind, which during ideal conditions continues after sunset in {{the upper reaches of the}} lake catchment. During light to moderate foehn northwesterly conditions, the combined lake breeze/valley wind system remains decoupled from the prevailing synoptic airstream. Towards evening when local thermal circulations weakened, a channelised foehn airstream often becomes dominant over the entire field area. Observations made during this investigation have a number of applied implications with respect to air pollution dispersion modelling and forecasting within alpine lake basins...|$|R
40|$|Wind speed {{analyses}} {{are currently being}} employed in several fields, especially in wind power generation. In this study, we used wind speed data from records of Universal Fuess <b>anemographs</b> {{at an altitude of}} 10 [*]m from 47 weather stations of the National Institute of Meteorology (Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia-INMET) from January 1986 to December 2011. The objective {{of the study was to}} investigate climatological aspects and wind speed trends. To this end, the following methods were used: filling of missing data, descriptive statistical calculations, boxplots, cluster analysis, and trend analysis using the Mann-Kendall statistical method. The seasonal variability of the average wind speeds of each group presented higher values for winter and spring and lower values in the summer and fall. The groups G 1, G 2, and G 5 showed higher annual averages in the interannual variability of wind speeds. These observed peaks were attributed to the El Niño and La Niña events, which change the behavior of global wind circulation and influence wind speeds over the region. Trend analysis showed more significant negative values for the G 3, G 4, and G 5 groups for all seasons of the year and in the annual average for the period under study...|$|R
40|$|The Economics of {{wind power}} {{generation}} being essentially {{determined by the}} power available from the wind, detailed statistics of hourly wind velocities {{over an extended period}} are necessary for estimating the actual output that may be expected. Such statistics are available from Meteorological Observatories and Weather Stations which are responsible for collecting and recording surface wind data. Regular observations of wind velocity and directions are made by the India Meteorological Department a t more than 200 stations 13; all over India. Average monthly and annual mean hourly 13; wind velocities at these stations have been tabulate 413; in 1. M. D. Scientific Notes Vol. VI, No. 63, Second 13; Edition, 1948. These data are useful for selection of windy areas in India. But they cannot be used for making estimates of available wind energy per annum at any place. continuous records of wind velocity from which velocity and power duration curves may be prepared for the whole year. The India Meteorological Department has installed recording <b>anemographs</b> at 24 stations and propose to install about 15 more at important centres in the near future. these continuous records wherever available have been used to estimate the energy available from the wind for purposes of electricity generation and other uses...|$|R
40|$|A {{regional}} climatology {{of strong}} wind gusts associated with thunderstorms is presented, {{and the ability}} to estimate gust strength from ambient conditions is tested. Strong wind events were selected for 10 stations in New South Wales, Australia, from <b>anemograph</b> records and coincident thunderstorm reports. Most events took place between midafternoon and late evening and during the warmer months of the year, which is broadly consistent with the occurrence of severe thunderstorms in general. One sounding-based index, designed to predict the strength of microbursts, proves to be of limited value in predicting the magnitude of strong convective gusts, even of short-lived gusts. A modified index that combines the microburst index with upper-level wind speed is more useful. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Using <b>anemograph</b> {{data from}} 8 {{stations}} in the Adriatic area and two {{stations in the}} interior of Croatia the main characteristics of wind persistence were delineated. For several thresholds of wind speeds the mean duration of continuous wind blowing and values of 90 %, 99 % and maximal duration of all cases are presented. For all duration of wind runs the simple function y = A + B/x could be used which connects the probability of occurrence y with the chosen duration of wind run x in hours, and coefficients A and B may be determined by several nomograms and by the annual wind speed. ln the last chapter of the work results on wind direction persistence are also presented...|$|E

40|$|O presente trabalho foi conduzido com o objetivo de estudar as probabilidades de ocorrência de ventos extremos e suas direções predominantes para a região de Lavras, MG. Foram usados os dados registrados pelo anemógrafo {{universal}} da Estação Climatológica Principal de Lavras, situada no campus da Universidade Federal de Lavras. Com os dados disponíveis (139 meses), no período {{de janeiro}} de 1988 a maio de 2004, verificou-se o ajuste à distribuição Gama pelo teste de &# 967;² a 5 % de probabilidade. Foram estimadas probabilidades de ocorrência de velocidades máximas diárias de vento iguais ou superiores a 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 e 100 km h- 1, para cada mês. Verificou-se que os meses de setembro a fevereiro apresentaram ventos fortes, com probabilidades de ocorrência superiores as dos outros meses. Para ventos bastante fortes acima de 100 km h- 1, as probabilidades de ocorrência são mínimas para todos os meses do ano. Quanto à direção para as rajadas de ventos, observou-se predominância das direções leste e oeste em relação às demais. The present work {{was carried out}} in order to study the ccurrence probabilities o of extreme winds and their predominant directions in the region of Lavras, Minas Gerais state, Brazil. The data were collected from graphic registrations of the universal <b>anemograph</b> of the Principal Climatological Station of Lavras, located in the campus of the Federal University of Lavras.

40|$|Neste trabalho, foram utilizados dados horários de velocidade e direção do vento, provenientes de registros de anemógrafo Universal Fuess, a 10 m de altura, de 77 estações climatológicas pertencentes ao Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia (INMET), no período {{de janeiro}} de 1977 a dezembro de 1981. O objetivo da pesquisa foi a determinação da potência eólica média horária da direção predominante do vento em todas as estações selecionadas. Para tanto, identificou-se a direção predominante do vento de cada localidade e se estimaram os parâmetros da distribuição de Weibull, através dos quais se calculou a potência eólica média horária. Em função dos resultados apresentados neste trabalho, constatou-se que a direção predominante do vento no Nordeste do Brasil é de Leste, com flutuações para Sudeste e Nordeste. O ajuste do Método dos Momentos evidenciou-se melhor que o dos Mínimos Quadrados. Os Estados do Maranhão e Rio Grande do Norte apresentaram, respectivamente, o menor e maior potencial eólico. As estações de Alto Parnaíba, MA, e Acaraú, CE, apresentaram, mensalmente, a menor (0, 022 W m- 2) e a maior (138, 302 W m- 2) potência eólica, respectivamente. Hourly mean data of wind speed and direction, {{measured}} with a Fuess <b>anemograph</b> at 10 m height, were used in this study. These {{data were collected from}} January 1977 to December 1981 at 77 weather stations located in the Northeast of Brazil. The main objective {{of the study was to}} determine the wind energy potential for the predominant wind direction of selected stations; therefore, the identification of the relative frequency related to the hourly mean wind speed of the predominant direction was carried out. Then, the parameters, of a Weibull distribution related to the hourly mean wind speed of the predominant direction at each station were estimated by Moments and Graphical methods. The results show that the predominant wind direction in Northeast as a whole is East Ward, with variation to Northeast and Southeast. The Weibull model fitted very well to the observed frequency distribution of the wind speed data used in this research. The lowest and the highest wind energy potential were observed in the States of Maranhão and Rio Grande do Norte, respectively. At Acaraú (Ceará) the highest monthly wind energy potential, of 138. 30 W m- 2 was observed. On the other hand, the lowest monthly wind energy potential (0. 022 W W m- 2) was registered at Alto Parnaíba, MA...|$|E
