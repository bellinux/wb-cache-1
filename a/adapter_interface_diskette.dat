50|$|Applying the {{dependency}} inversion principle {{can also be}} seen {{as an example of the}} adapter pattern, i.e. the high-level class defines its own <b>adapter</b> <b>interface</b> which is the abstraction that the other high-level classes depend on. The adaptee implementation also depends on the <b>adapter</b> <b>interface</b> abstraction (of course, since it implements its interface) while it can be implemented by using code from within its own low-level module. The high-level has no dependency on the low-level module since it only uses the low-level indirectly through the <b>adapter</b> <b>interface</b> by invoking polymorphic methods to the interface which are implemented by the adaptee and its low-level module.|$|R

40|$|<b>Interface</b> <b>adapters</b> allow {{applications}} {{written for}} one interface {{to be reused}} with another interface without having to rewrite application code, and chaining <b>interface</b> <b>adapters</b> can significantly reduce the development effort required to create the <b>adapters.</b> However, <b>interface</b> <b>adapters</b> will often be unable to convert interfaces perfectly, so {{there must be a}} way to analyze the loss from <b>interface</b> <b>adapter</b> chains in order {{to improve the quality of}} interface adaptation. This paper describes a probabilistic approach to analyzing loss in <b>interface</b> <b>adapter</b> chains, which not only models whether a method can be adapted but also how well methods can be adapted. We also show that probabilistic optimal adapter chaining is an NP-complete problem, so we describe a greedy algorithm which can construct an optimal <b>interface</b> <b>adapter</b> chain with exponential time in the worst case.

However, many people knew that a modem connected a computer to the Internet over a telephone line. To take advantage of consumers' familiarity with modems, companies called these devices broadband modems rather than using less familiar terms such as <b>adapter,</b> <b>interface,</b> transceiver, or bridge. In fact, broadband modems fit the definition of modem because they use complex waveforms to carry digital data. They use more advanced technology than dial-up modems: typically they can modulate and demodulate hundreds of channels simultaneously or use much wider channels than dial-up modems.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Nowadays {{technologies}} such as the wireless connectivity, embedded devices and MEMS provide a possibility to build tiny compact devices which have sensing, computing and networking capabilities. The sensors connected to the embedded devices give new possibilities and environments for collecting sensor data and passing it to the networks or other devices. Wireless sensor node technology, as the name suggest, is purposely designed to collect sensor data from the sensor network cluster(s) or a single sensor. “The Internet of Things” defines the systems that consist of networks and networks of sensors, actuators, and smart objects which are interconnected together allowing communication with one another; {{some of which have}} decision making capabilities. The wireless sensor networks and the Internet of Things provide several data centric protocols to access sensor data of sensor networks and the embedded devices. Data centric protocols are based on two paradigms request-response and publish-subscribe. The Publish and subscribe is quite popular in today’s solution because the same sensor data can be routed and published to several final processing units or the devices which are connected to the router gateways. Sensor communication protocol with the connectivity bus <b>adapter</b> <b>interfaces</b> provides an easy and simple way to access sensor register over different kinds of connectivity. Protocol can be integrated to the embedded device which then provides the message passing with two connectivity <b>adapter</b> <b>interfaces.</b> A lower level connectivity interface provides a possibility to interact with the sensor via I 2 C of SPI buses. A high level interface provides a connection to and from the devices over the wired or wireless connections...|$|R

40|$|A {{universal}} <b>interface</b> <b>adapter</b> circuit <b>interfaces,</b> for example, {{a wireless}} communications headset with {{any type of}} communications system, including those that require push-to-talk (PTT) signaling. The <b>interface</b> <b>adapter</b> is comprised of several main components, including an RF signaling receiver, a microcontroller and associated circuitry for decoding and processing the received signals, and programmable impedance matching and line interfacing circuitry for interfacing a wireless communications headset system base to a communications system. A signaling transmitter, which is preferably portable (e. g., handheld), is employed by the wireless headset user to send signals to the signaling receiver. In an {{embodiment of the invention}} directed specifically to push-to-talk (PTT) signaling, the wireless headset user presses a button on the signaling transmitter when they wish to speak. This sends a signal to the microcontroller which decodes the signal and recognizes the signal as being a PTT request. In response, the microcontroller generates a control signal that closes a switch to complete a voice connection between the headset system base and the communications system so that the user can communicate with the communications system. With this arrangement, the wireless headset can be interfaced to any communications system that requires PTT signaling, without modification of the headset device. In addition, the <b>interface</b> <b>adapter</b> can also be configured to respond to or deliver any other types of signals, such as dual-tone-multiple-frequency (DTMF) tones, and on/off hook signals. The present invention is also scalable, and permits multiple wireless users to operate independently in the same environment through use of a plurality of the <b>interface</b> <b>adapters...</b>|$|R
