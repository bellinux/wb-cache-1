5|$|In {{light of}} this information, it is {{unlikely}} that Cairano, at his death, was able to pass on <b>an</b> <b>artistic</b> legacy to assure the survival of his studio, despite having trained his son and other co-workers, as well as artists such as Ambrogio Mazzola, whose Madonna and Child, signed and dated 1536 and preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, clearly shows the influence of Cairano's style from thirty years before. This appears to be a nostalgic and naive tribute to a master, who apparently had bequeathed <b>an</b> <b>artistic</b> footprint that his collaborators not only replicated tirelessly but also felt unable to evolve further.|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} Nri had <b>an</b> <b>artistic</b> {{as well as}} {{religious}} influence on the lower Niger. Sculptures found there are bronze like those at Igbo-Ukwu.

5|$|A long, straight-bladed dagger (pugio) was the gladiator's final weapon. A {{tombstone}} {{found in}} Romania shows a retiarius holding a dagger with four spikes (known as a quadrenseach spike {{at the corner}} of a square guard) instead of the usual bladed dagger. This was previously thought to be <b>an</b> <b>artistic</b> invention or perhaps a ceremonial weapon but a recently excavated femur bone from a gladiator graveyard in Ephesus has wounds consistent with the use of such a weapon.|$|E

5|$|Although the British Army {{refused to}} co-operate with the producers—and Winston Churchill thought the film would ruin wartime morale—Colonel Blimp confounded critics when {{it proved to}} be <b>an</b> <b>artistic</b> and {{commercial}} success. Powell hoped to reunite Kerr and lead actor Roger Livesey in his next film, A Canterbury Tale (1944), but her agent had sold her contract to MGM. According to Powell, his affair with Kerr ended when she made it clear to him that she would accept an offer to go to Hollywood if one were made.|$|E

5|$|Greek {{influence}}, {{which had}} {{made its way}} to Phoenicia during the Persian period, now became stronger. Figurines found in Kharayeb show Aegean influence on local craftsmen.

5|$|Mrs. Tiggy-winkle {{has been}} {{described}} as one of Potter's most positive creations, but critics consider Lucie <b>an</b> <b>artistic</b> failure. Although Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle is set in an identifiable place and time period, the tale is mythologized by reaching back to an age when household chores were performed manually and without the aid of modern mechanical inventions. The simple dwellings, rustic pathways, and stone fences enhance the tale's timeless aspect and suggest an unchanging countryside and its way of life.|$|E
5|$|Renaissance art marks a {{cultural}} rebirth {{at the close}} of the Middle Ages and rise of the Modern world. One of the distinguishing features of Renaissance art was its development of highly realistic linear perspective. Giotto di Bondone (1267–1337) is credited with first treating a painting as a window into space, but it was not until the demonstrations of architect Filippo Brunelleschi (1377–1446) and the subsequent writings of Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472) that perspective was formalized as <b>an</b> <b>artistic</b> technique.|$|E
