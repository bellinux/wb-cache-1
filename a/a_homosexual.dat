5|$|C. J. gets emotionally {{involved}} in {{a story about the}} deadly assault on <b>a</b> <b>homosexual</b> youth. She sees {{this as an opportunity to}} push hate crime legislation, but the suggestion finds little support among the others. Reporter Danny Concannon also disagrees, but this encourages her to finally accept his offer of a date, to have him convince her.|$|E
5|$|David N. Cicilline {{finished}} his term as mayor in 2010, {{eight years after}} taking office as the first homosexual mayor of an American state capital. Providence was the largest American city to have <b>a</b> <b>homosexual</b> mayor until Sam Adams took office in Portland, Oregon on January 1, 2009. The city's first Latino mayor was Angel Taveras, who assumed office on January 3, 2011. Jorge Elorza succeeded him on January 5, 2015.|$|E

Due to feeling sorry for Mitsunaga being forced to cross-dress, Hiro willingly dresses as a girl and normally dresses in a maid outfit. He has <b>a</b> <b>homosexual</b> relationship with Mitsunaga.|$|E

5|$|Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Elder Paul Ryder, a prickly, {{judgmental}} young missionary assigned as Aaron's partner, Ryder is not {{enthusiastic about}} being in LA and even less so about living next door to <b>a</b> <b>homosexual.</b> Gordon-Levitt originally auditioned to play Aaron, but his aggressive attitude toward the script but {{good sense of humor}} made the producers decide he was a perfect Ryder.|$|E
5|$|Albert Victor's intellect, {{sexuality}} {{and mental health}} {{have been the subject}} of speculation. Rumours linked him with the Cleveland Street scandal, which involved <b>a</b> <b>homosexual</b> brothel, but there is no conclusive evidence that he ever went there or was even homosexual. Some authors have argued that he was the serial killer known as Jack the Ripper, but contemporary documents show that Albert Victor could not have been in London at the time of the murders, and the claim is widely dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Bessell {{noted that}} Thorpe, {{for all his}} gregariousness and warmth, {{appeared}} to have no female friends and lacked any interest in girls. The former Liberal MP Frank Owen confided to Bessell his suspicions that Thorpe was a homosexual; other West Country Liberals had formed the same opinion. Aware that exposure as <b>a</b> <b>homosexual</b> would end Thorpe's career, Bessell became his self-appointed protector, even to the extent, he later said, of falsely claiming to be bisexual, {{as a means of}} acquiring his friend's confidence.|$|E

50|$|Raffalovich drew, however, a {{difference}} with heterosexuality {{based on the}} idea of vice and virtue. He regarded a heterosexual's destiny as marriage and starting a family, whereas <b>a</b> <b>homosexual's</b> duty, he believed, was to overcome and transcend his desires with artistic pursuits and spiritual - even mystical - friendships.|$|R

5|$|During World War II, San Francisco {{became a}} major debarkation point for {{servicemen}} stationed in the Pacific Theater. The U.S. military, which was concerned about male homosexuality, had a policy of dismissing servicemen caught in known gay establishments with blue discharges. As many of these men faced ostracism from their communities and families, they chose {{to remain in the}} city. The number of men that remained was a significant factor in the creation of <b>a</b> <b>homosexual</b> community in San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} since its release, modern film {{scholars}} {{have noted the}} possible homosexual reading of the film. Director James Whale was openly gay, {{and some of the}} actors in the cast, including Ernest Thesiger and Colin Clive, were believed to be gay or bisexual. Although James Curtis, Whale's biographer, rejects the notion that Whale would have identified with the Monster from <b>a</b> <b>homosexual</b> perspective, scholars have perceived a gay subtext suffused through the film, especially a camp sensibility, particularly embodied in the character of Pretorius and his relationship with Henry.|$|E
5|$|Like {{his father}} before him, Alec Waugh {{went to school}} at Sherborne, and, it was presumed by the family that Evelyn would follow, but in 1915, the school asked Alec to leave, after <b>a</b> <b>homosexual</b> {{relationship}} came to light. Alec departed Sherborne for military training as an officer, and, while awaiting confirmation of his commission, wrote The Loom of Youth (1917), a novel of school life, which alluded to homosexual friendships at a school that was recognisably Sherborne. The public sensation caused by Alec's novel so offended the school that it became impossible for Evelyn to go there. In May 1917, much to his annoyance, {{he was sent to}} Lancing College, in his opinion, a decidedly inferior school.|$|E

5|$|NIS {{investigators}} {{tried to}} prove, unsuccessfully, that Hartwig and Truitt had had <b>a</b> <b>homosexual</b> relationship {{with each other}} and that Hartwig had initiated the explosion after the relationship had soured. As the NIS investigation continued, information about the Navy's focus on the two sailors and innuendoes about their relationship were leaked to the media. The leaks were later said to have come from the NIS and from the Navy's headquarters. Thompson alleges that during its investigation, NIS agents lied or otherwise conducted themselves in an extremely unprofessional manner.|$|E
5|$|The first {{investigation}} into the explosion, conducted by the U.S. Navy, concluded {{that one of the}} gun turret crew members, Clayton Hartwig, who died in the explosion, had deliberately caused it. During the investigation, numerous leaks to the media, later attributed to U.S. Navy officers and investigators, implied that Hartwig and another sailor, Kendall Truitt, had engaged in <b>a</b> <b>homosexual</b> relationship and that Hartwig had caused the explosion after their relationship had soured. In its report, however, the U.S. Navy concluded that the evidence did not show that Hartwig was homosexual but that he was suicidal and had caused the explosion with either an electronic or chemical detonator.|$|E
5|$|The series {{includes}} <b>a</b> <b>homosexual</b> character, Guillermo Almada (Juan Gil Navarro), {{who came}} out in the early episodes and later married his partner in a ceremony featuring guest appearances by Evangelina Salazar and Luis Brandoni. This was the first fictional same-sex marriage on Argentine television since it was legalized in 2010, reflected the growing acceptance of sexual freedom in Argentina. Another character, Patricia Longo, was an obese girl who was a victim of school bullying. Isabel Macedo had to be heavily made up to appear obese for the flashbacks. Patricia was initially the telenovela's villain, with the bullying her motivation for inflicting revenge on her former classmates. The episode in which she reveals her true identity was well received.|$|E

At first Broman does not take kindly to Jönssi and Dille who Elmeri befriends after Broman's SEAT Málaga crashes with their Dodge Aspen. Mirroring a common Finnish stereotype, Broman's speech is sometimes littered with Swedish utterances.|$|R
5|$|Todd is briefly {{questioned}} {{about his relationship}} with Dussander, but he manages to convince the police that he knew nothing of the old man's true identity. At the hospital, Dussander hears a group of Neo-Nazis demonstrating outside the hospital; realizing his identity has been hopelessly compromised, he commits suicide by giving himself an air embolism. When French learns that the man who met Todd at school was not Todd's grandfather but a war criminal, he confronts Todd, who then blackmails him into silence by threatening to accuse him of making inappropriate sexual advances towards him, and to thereby expose him publicly as <b>a</b> <b>homosexual</b> and pederast.|$|E
5|$|When Lowe {{arrived at}} Singapore Changi Airport {{on the morning}} of 8 March, he was accosted by Martin (under the assumed name of Simon Davis), who struck up a {{conversation}} with him and suggested that they share a room, to which Lowe agreed. They managed to book Room 1511 in the River View Hotel off Havelock Road. The next morning, Martin asked a hotel receptionist to delete Lowe's name from the room registration system, saying that he had kicked Lowe out the previous night for being <b>a</b> <b>homosexual.</b> Martin checked out on 11 March and flew to Bangkok the same day.|$|E
5|$|According to Josiffe's account, <b>a</b> <b>homosexual</b> {{liaison with}} Thorpe began that same evening, at Thorpe's mother's home in Oxted, and {{continued}} for several years. Thorpe, while acknowledging that a friendship developed, denied any sexual dimension in the relationship. He organised accommodation for Josiffe in London, and a longer-term {{stay with a}} family in Barnstaple, within the North Devon constituency. He paid for advertisements in Country Life magazine, {{in an effort to}} find work with horses for his friend, arranged various temporary jobs, and promised to help Josiffe to realise an ambition to study dressage in France. On the basis of Josiffe's claim that his father had died in an air crash, Thorpe's solicitors investigated whether any money was due, but found that Albert Josiffe was alive and well in Orpington.|$|E

5|$|According to medieval scholar Richard Zeikowitz, the Green Knight {{represents}} {{a threat to}} homosocial friendship in his medieval world. Zeikowitz argues that the narrator of the poem seems entranced by the Knight's beauty, homoeroticising him in poetic form. The Green Knight's attractiveness challenges the homosocial rules of King Arthur's court and {{poses a threat to}} their way of life. Zeikowitz also states that Gawain seems to find Bertilak as attractive as the narrator finds the Green Knight. Bertilak, however, follows the homosocial code and develops a friendship with Gawain. Gawain's embracing and kissing Bertilak in several scenes thus represents not <b>a</b> <b>homosexual</b> but a homosocial expression. Men of the time often embraced and kissed and this was acceptable under the chivalric code. Nonetheless, the Green Knight blurs the lines between homosociality and homosexuality, representing the difficulty medieval writers sometimes had in separating the two.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{life has}} also been used {{in a wide variety}} of other media. The {{director}} David Bintley used Marlowe's play as the basis for the ballet Edward II, first performed in 1995; the music from the ballet forms a part of composer John McCabe's symphony Edward II, produced in 2000. Novels such as John Penford's 1984 The Gascon and Chris Hunt's 1992 Gaveston have focused on the sexual aspects of Edward and Gaveston's relationship, while Stephanie Merritt's 2002 Gaveston transports the story into the 20th century. Marcus Stone's painting Edward II and Piers Gaveston strongly hinted at <b>a</b> <b>homosexual</b> relationship between the pair, while avoiding making this aspect explicit; it was initially shown at the Royal Academy in 1872, but was marginalised in later decades as the issue of homosexuality became more sensitive.|$|E
5|$|Francis J. Underwood {{was born}} on November 5, 1959, to Catherine and Calvin T. Underwood in Gaffney, South Carolina. He is an only child. He was raised in impoverished circumstances, {{with the threat of}} bank {{foreclosure}} on the farm they lived on. He entered The Sentinel, a military school in Charleston, South Carolina, loosely based on The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina, in the fall of 1976. He graduated in 1981 and, despite having made poor grades, gained admittance into Harvard Law School. He graduated from there in 1984. While at the Sentinel, he had <b>a</b> <b>homosexual</b> relationship with his roommate, Tim Corbet, which lasted until his first year of law school. Underwood was raised Christian but holds God in complete contempt.|$|E
