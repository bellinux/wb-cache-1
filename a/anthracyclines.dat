5|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} is {{a recent}} innovation, consisting of some combination of paclitaxel (or other taxanes like docetaxel), doxorubicin (and other <b>anthracyclines),</b> and platins (particularly cisplatin and carboplatin).

Mutations in mismatch repair genes, like those found in Lynch syndrome, can lead to resistance against platins, meaning that chemotherapy with platins is ineffective in people with these mutations. Side effects of chemotherapy are common. These include hair loss, low neutrophil levels in the blood, and gastrointestinal problems.|$|E

40|$|The {{cumulative}} incidence of anthracycline-induced clinical heart failure (A-CHF) {{in a large}} cohort of 830 children treated with a mean cumulative <b>anthracycline</b> dose of 288 mg/m 2 (median 280 mg/m 2; range 15 - 900 mg/m 2) with a very long and complete follow-up {{after the start of}} <b>anthracycline</b> therapy (mean 8. 5 years; median 7. 1 years; range 0. 01 - 28. 4 years) was 2. 5 %. A cumulative <b>anthracycline</b> dose of 300 mg/m 2 or more was the only independent risk factor (relative risk (RR) = 8). The estimated risk of A-CHF increased with time to 5. 5 % at 20 years after the start of <b>anthracycline</b> therapy; 9. 8 % if treated with 300 mg/m 2 or more. In conclusion, 1 in every 10 children treated with a cumulative <b>anthracycline</b> dose of 300 mg/m 2 or more will eventually develop A-CHF.

PATIENTS [...] Five children in whom recurrence of malignant disease was re-treated with chemotherapy containing <b>anthracycline</b> drugs and additional ICRF 187 (supplied on a compassionate-use basis) (cumulative <b>anthracycline</b> doses 550 - 1650 mg/m 2). Five more children with recurrence of malignant disease were re-treated to similar cumulative <b>anthracycline</b> doses (600 - 1150 mg/m 2) without ICRF 187. METHODS [...] Cardiac function was assessed clinically and echocardiographically throughout treatment. Clinical and echocardiographic state were compared before treatment and after completion of therapy within and between groups treated with and without ICRF 187. RESULTS [...] Two patients treated without ICRF 187 developed symptomatic congestive cardiac failure from which one died. Another developed considerable but as yet asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. No patient receiving additional ICRF 187 developed cardiac failure or left ventricular dysfunction. There {{were no significant differences in}} cumulative <b>anthracycline</b> dose, dose increase, type of <b>anthracycline</b> used, survival rate, or length of survival between groups. Left ventricular shortening fraction fell by a mean of 1. 0 % in patients receiving ICRF 187 and by a mean of 11 % in the patients treated without it (p = 0. 04). CONCLUSIONS [...] ICRF 187 seems to have provided highly effective cardioprotection to this small group of children with end-stage malignancy. Severe cardiotoxicity was seen in a similar group treated with comparable <b>anthracycline</b> doses but without ICRF 187...|$|R

40|$|The {{recently}} developed <b>anthracycline</b> 4 '-epiadriamycin, an anti-cancer drug with improved activity, differs from adriamycin by inversion of the stereochemistry at the 4 '-position.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To examine left {{ventricular}} (LV) diastolic function in patients previously treated with <b>anthracycline</b> drugs for childhood malignancy. To consider clinical relevance, relations with systolic dysfunction, and the pathophysiology of <b>anthracycline</b> cardiotoxicity. DESIGN [...] Cross sectional echocardiographic study of LV function. SETTING [...] Supraregional centre for paediatric cardiology, principal centre {{for the treatment}} of childhood malignancy in southwest England. PATIENTS [...] 226 of 236 patients surviving between 6. 5 months and 17 (median 5. 3) years from initial <b>anthracycline</b> treatment for childhood malignancy attended for clinical and echocardiographic examination. Cumulative <b>anthracycline</b> doses were between 50 and 750 (median 300) mg/m 2. 22 patients had also received cardiac irradiation. METHODS [...] Detailed assessment of transmitral diastolic pulsed wave Doppler flow patterns along with LV dimensions and systolic function measured by M mode echocardiography. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Peak early (E) and atrial (A) phase filling velocities and EA ratio, time and acceleration and deceleration to and from peak E velocity, velocity integrals and ratio, isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT), and heart rate were measured. Results were examined in relation to LV cavity and posterior wall dimensions and shortening fraction (SF), and compared with paired control data matched for body surface area. RESULTS [...] Eleven (5 %) patients had abnormal effort tolerance. Fifty one (23 %) had SF 60 % of irradiated patients who received > 400 mg/m 2 of <b>anthracycline</b> were symptomatic. Early diastolic filling was relatively normal or enhanced at low <b>anthracycline</b> doses or when SF was preserved, with a shorter IVRT and increased atrial phase filling. Early filling was reduced at higher doses or with reduced SF, with longer IVRT and a further increase in atrial phase filling. A more "restrictive" pattern of diastolic filling (with high E and low A velocities) was seen in some patients, particularly after cardiac irradiation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The use of <b>anthracycline</b> {{chemotherapy}} {{is limited}} by the occurrence of cardiotoxicity. In an effort to prevent this cardiotoxicity, different <b>anthracycline</b> dosage schedules (i. e. peak doses and infusion durations) have been studied. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to determine the occurrence of cardiotoxicity with the use of different <b>anthracycline</b> dosage schedules in cancer patients. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the databases of The Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2004) and EMBASE (1980 to June 2004). In addition, we searched reference lists of relevant articles, conference proceedings and ongoing trials databases. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which different <b>anthracycline</b> dosage schedules were compared in cancer patients (children and adults). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently performed the study selection, quality assessment and data-extraction including adverse effects. MAIN RESULTS: We identified six RCTs of varying quality addressing different <b>anthracycline</b> infusion durations (625 patients). The meta-analysis showed a statistically significant lower rate of clinical heart failure with an infusion duration of 6 hours or longer as compared to a shorter infusion duration, i. e. maximal duration of 1 hour (RR = 0. 27; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 09 to 0. 81; 5 studies; 557 patients). In individual studies the infusion duration of 6 hours or longer also seemed {{to reduce the risk of}} subclinical cardiac damage. No statistically significant difference in response rate was found (RR = 0. 83; 95 % CI 0. 45 to 1. 54; 2 studies; 292 patients). No statistically significant difference in overall survival was found (HR = 1, 42; 95 % CI 0. 61 to 3. 30; 2 studies; 322 patients), but there was unexplained heterogeneity (I(2) = 75 %). No conclusions can be made regarding adverse effects. It should be emphasised that the majority of patients included in these studies were adults with different solid tumours. Children with leukaemia could not be included in the performed meta-analyses, but they were included in the descriptive results of non-pooled studies. No RCTs addressing different <b>anthracycline</b> peak doses with the same cumulative <b>anthracycline</b> dose in both treatment groups were identified. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: An <b>anthracycline</b> infusion duration of six hours or longer reduces the risk of clinical heart failure, and it seems to reduce the risk of subclinical cardiac damage. There is no evidence which suggests a difference in response rate and survival between both treatment groups. Since there is only a small amount of data for children and also because data obtained in adults cannot be extrapolated to children, different <b>anthracycline</b> infusion durations should be evaluated further in children. For different <b>anthracycline</b> peak doses no high quality evidence was available and therefore, no definitive conclusions can be made about the occurrence of cardiotoxicity in patients treated with different <b>anthracycline</b> peak dose...|$|R
