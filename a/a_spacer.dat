25|$|When a microbe is {{invaded by}} a virus, {{the first stage}} of the immune {{response}} is to capture viral DNA and insert it into a CRISPR locus in the form of <b>a</b> <b>spacer.</b> Cas1 and Cas2 are found in all three types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which indicates that they are involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of cas1 or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.|$|E
25|$|The anode and cathode foils must be {{protected}} from direct {{contact with each other}} because such contact, even at relatively low voltages, may lead to a short circuit. In case of direct contact of both foils the oxide layer on the anode surface gives no protection. <b>A</b> <b>spacer</b> or separator made of a special highly absorbent paper with high purity protects the two metal foils from direct contact. This capacitor paper also serves as a reservoir for the electrolyte to extend the lifetime of the capacitor.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference {{is built into}} the crRNAs and is therefore likely common to all three systems. Throughout the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain <b>a</b> <b>spacer</b> sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage. RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.|$|E

25|$|However, metal spacers conduct heat (unless {{the metal}} is {{thermally}} improved), undermining {{the ability of}} the insulated glass unit (IGU) to reduce heat flow. It may also result in water or ice forming {{at the bottom of the}} sealed unit because of the sharp temperature difference between the window and surrounding air. To reduce heat transfer through the spacer and increase overall thermal performance, manufacturers may make the spacer out of a less-conductive material such as structural foam. <b>A</b> <b>spacer</b> made of aluminum that also contains a highly structural thermal barrier reduces condensation on the glass surface and improves insulation, as measured by the overall U-value.|$|E
25|$|Chirality {{is another}} {{property}} that a DNAzyme can exploit. DNA occurs in {{nature as a}} right-handed double helix and in asymmetric synthesis a chiral catalyst is a valuable tool in the synthesis of chiral molecules from an achiral source. In one application an artificial DNA catalyst was prepared by attaching a copper ion to it through <b>a</b> <b>spacer.</b> The copper - DNA complex catalysed a Diels-Alder reaction in water between cyclopentadiene and an aza chalcone. The reaction products (endo and exo) {{were found to be}} present in an enantiomeric excess of 50%. Later it was found that an enantiomeric excess of 99% could be induced, and that both the rate and the enantioselectivity were related to the DNA sequence.|$|E
500|$|The 32X can be {{used only}} in {{conjunction}} with a Genesis system. [...] It is inserted into the system like a standard game cartridge. [...] The add-on requires its own separate power supply, a connection cable linking it to the Genesis, and an additional conversion cable for the original model of the Genesis. [...] As well as playing its own library of cartridges, the 32X is backwards-compatible with Genesis games, and can also be used in conjunction with the Sega CD to play games that use both add-ons. [...] The 32X also came with <b>a</b> <b>spacer</b> so it would fit properly with the second model of the Genesis; an optional spacer was offered for use with the Sega Genesis CDX system, but ultimately never shipped due to risks of electric shock when the 32X and CDX were connected. [...] Installation of the 32X also requires the insertion of two included electromagnetic shield plates into the Genesis' cartridge slot.|$|E

2500|$|The Native American flute is {{the only}} flute in the world {{constructed}} with two air chambers - there is a wall inside the flute between the top (slow) air chamber and the bottom chamber which has the whistle and finger holes. The top chamber {{also serves as a}} secondary resonator, which gives the flute its distinctive sound. There is a hole {{at the bottom of the}} [...] "slow" [...] air chamber and a (generally) square hole at the top of the playing chamber. A block (or [...] "bird") with <b>a</b> <b>spacer</b> is tied on top of the flute to form a thin, flat airstream for the whistle hole (or [...] "window").

30|$|Magnetoresistance {{measurements}} {{were performed on}} three gated Hall bars (samples A, B and C) made from modulation-doped GaAs/Al 0.33 Ga 0.67 As heterostructures. For sample A, the structure consists of a semi-insulating (SI) GaAs (001) substrate, followed by an undoped 20 -nm GaAs quantum well, an 80 -nm undoped Al 0.33 Ga 0.67 <b>As</b> <b>spacer,</b> <b>a</b> 210 -nm Si-doped Al 0.33 Ga 0.67 As, and finally a 10 -nm GaAs cap layer. For sample B, the structure consists of an SI GaAs (001) substrate, followed by an undoped 20 -nm GaAs quantum well, a 77 -nm undoped Al 0.33 Ga 0.67 <b>As</b> <b>spacer,</b> <b>a</b> 210 -nm Si-doped Al 0.33 Ga 0.67 As, and finally a 10 -nm GaAs cap layer. Sample C is a modulation-doped GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure in which self-assembled InAs quantum dots are inserted {{into the center of}} the GaAs well [12]. The following sequence was grown on an SI GaAs (001) substrate: 40 -nm undoped Al 0.33 Ga 0.67 As layer, 20 -nm GaAs quantum well inserted with 2.15 monolayer of InAs quantum dots in the center, a 40 -nm undoped Al 0.33 Ga 0.67 <b>As</b> <b>spacer,</b> <b>a</b> 20 -nm Si-doped Al 0.33 Ga 0.67 As, and finally a 10 -nm GaAs cap layer. Because of the lack of inversion symmetry and the presence of interface electric fields, zero-field spin splitting may be present in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. However, it is expected that the energy splitting will be too small (0.01 K) to be important in our devices [13]. For sample A, at Vg = 0 the carrier concentration of the 2 DEG was 1.14 × 1011 cm- 2 with a mobility of 1.5 × 106 cm 2 /Vs in the dark. For sample B, at Vg = 0 the carrier concentration of the 2 DEG was 9.1 × 1010 cm- 2 with a mobility of 2.0 × 106 cm 2 /Vs in the dark. The self-assembled InAs dots act as scattering centers in the GaAs 2 DEG [12, 14]; thus, the 2 DEG has a mobility much lower than those for samples A and B. For sample C, at Vg = 0 the carrier concentration of the 2 DEG was 1.48 × 1011 cm- 2 with a mobility of 1.86 × 104 cm 2 /Vs in the dark. Experiments were performed in a He 3 cryostat and the four-terminal magnetoresistance was measured with standard phase-sensitive lock-in techniques.|$|R

2500|$|An {{aluminum}} {{electrolytic capacitor}} with a non-solid electrolyte always consists of two aluminum foils separated mechanically by <b>a</b> <b>spacer,</b> mostly paper, which is saturated with a liquid or gel-like electrolyte. One of the aluminum foils, the anode, is etched (roughened) to increase the surface and oxidized (formed). The second aluminum foil, called the [...] "cathode foil", serves to make electrical contact with the electrolyte. A paper spacer mechanically separates the foils to avoid direct metallic contact. Both foils and the spacer are wound and the winding is impregnated with liquid electrolyte. The electrolyte, which serves as cathode of the capacitor, covers the etched rough structure of the oxide layer on the anode perfectly and makes the increased anode surface effectual. After impregnation the impregnated winding is mounted in an aluminum case and sealed.|$|E
