Para tal efecto, los autores describen dichas etapas, e indican sus deficiencias, proponiendo ciertas pautas de reforma enmarcadas en el análisis económico del derecho y el derecho comparado. In this article, {{the authors}} adopt an {{approach}} {{based on the}} economic analysis of law {{to argue that the}} stages of verification and <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims,</b> and of liquidation of assets, in bankruptcy cases, should aim to enhance recoveries and benefits for creditors, as a normative objective. In this regard, the authors describe these stages, pointing out the deficiencies of current law, and proposing certain guidelines for a reform framed in the economic analysis of law and in comparative law...|$|E

6000|$|We {{know that}} this {{affecting}} remonstrance was in part successful; for long afterwards, he says, in allusion to this period, [...] "Even from a bare treasury, my success has been contrary to that of Mr. Cowley; and Gideon's fleece has there been moistened, when all the ground was dry." [...] But in the <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> this <b>claim</b> to the more regular payment of his pension, was comprehended all Rochester's title to Dryden's gratitude. The poet could not obtain the small employment which he so earnestly solicited; and such was the recompense of the merry monarch and his counsellors, to one whose productions had strengthened the pillars of his throne, as well as renovated the literary taste of the nation.[43] ...|$|R
5000|$|Potter's {{suggestion}} that he might occasionally pay Walton for hours he had not worked was disproved by {{an examination of the}} sums he had indented for wages from L. L. Potter & Co. and those he had paid to Walton. What Potter was in reality doing was claiming more than he needed to pay his employee, and pocketing the difference. Fabian's comment was that [...] "Potter, by his own <b>admission,</b> is guilty <b>of</b> <b>claiming</b> more wages than were due and {{there is no doubt that}} he was making a good thing out of Walton's employment by him".|$|R
5000|$|It {{is known}} that many {{instruments}} that bear his label are inauthentic. A cello once owned by Pablo Casals was for many years {{thought to be a}} Bergonzi because of the label it bore indicated: [...] "Carlo Bergonzi [...] [...] [...] 1733." [...] It was later found to have actually been made by Matteo Goffriller. In 1881 a sensational court case was held in London over claims that the well-known luthier Georges Chanot III had given a fake Bergonzi label to a violin and then sold it as genuine. His deception was discovered by violin-maker William Ebsworth Hill but Chanot qualified his <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> guilt by <b>claiming</b> that this was common practice in the violin-selling business; the court was unconvinced by his explanation and found him guilty.|$|R
50|$|Born in Paris in France in 1830, {{the son of}} Georges Chanot II and {{the younger}} brother of Adolphe Chanot, he {{originally}} was apprenticed to his father George Chanot II in Paris, and later worked {{as an assistant to}} Charles Adolphe Maucotel (c.1820-1858) at Rupert Street in London from 1851-1857. When Maucotel retired Chanot bought the business and from 1858 he successfully ran it from 157 Wardour Street in the Soho district of London, mostly selling violins made by his father. However, he lived an extravagant lifestyle and spent his money as fast as he made it. In 1881 he was at the centre of a court case concerning a violin to which he had given a fake Carlo Bergonzi label and then sold as genuine. His deception was discovered by violin-maker William Ebsworth Hill but Chanot qualified his <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> guilt by <b>claiming</b> that this was common practice in the violin-selling business; the court was unconvinced by his explanation and found him guilty.|$|R
5000|$|In 1971, Hillgruber was {{a leading}} critic of the Quadripartite Agreement {{on the status of}} Berlin accusing the West German {{government}} and the three western powers with rights in West Berlin, namely the United States, Great Britain and France of granting approval to what he saw as the illegal Soviet occupation of eastern Germany and the equally illegitimate East German regime {{while at the same time}} accepted the partition of Berlin as permanent. Hillgruber wrote that the agreement had confirmed the [...] "status quo minus" [...] of Berlin, and that the agreement was too vague with the reference to the [...] "existing conditions in the relevant area". Finally, Hillgruber charged that the West had given in by promising to limit contact between West and East Berlin and allowing a Soviet consulate to be established in West Berlin, which Hillgruber claimed was an implicit <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> the Soviet <b>claim</b> that West Berlin was not part of the Federal Republic.|$|R
500|$|Although some {{perceive}} the settlement as an <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> guilt, the settlement agreement specifically stated that Jackson admitted no wrongdoing and no liability and legally, a settlement {{cannot be used}} as evidence of guilt in future civil and criminal cases. The settlement payment was [...] "for alleged personal injuries arising out <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> negligence and not for <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> intentional or wrong acts of sexual molestation." [...] In the settlement, both parties agreed they would not speak about the case details in public {{but it did not}} prevent the Chandlers from testifying in a criminal trial or sharing information with authorities in a criminal investigation. The settlement document adamantly states there is no <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> wrongdoing on Jackson's part and no <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> molestation or immodesty and that under no circumstances shall any payment be withheld from the complainants, even if they were to testify against Jackson.|$|R

50|$|The {{inadmissibility}} <b>of</b> settlement <b>claims</b> only {{prohibits the}} <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> statements, not the <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> facts. Thus, if {{a party to}} a settlement conference mentions that she possesses a certain document relevant to the proceedings, the other party may seek to discover that document through legal processes, despite it having first been mentioned in the settlement conference; merely disclosing a document's existence and mentioning it during a settlement conference does not insulate it from being discovered and admitted.|$|R

Faced with pressure from nearly all the other African countries, the ROC relented under protest. Mongolia and Mauritania were both admitted to the UN on 27 October 1961.

The only veto cast by the ROC during its membership in the UN was in 1955, against the <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> Mongolia. Thus, Mongolia was excluded from the UN until 1960, when the Soviet Union announced that unless Mongolia was admitted, it would block the <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> all of the newly independent African states.
