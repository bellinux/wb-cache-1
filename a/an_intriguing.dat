5|$|Some {{fans have}} {{suggested}} that our new Enterprise should carry a plaque somewhere which commemorates the fact it was named after the first space shuttle launched from Earth in 1970s. This is <b>an</b> <b>intriguing</b> idea. It also has publicity advantages if properly released at the right time. It won't hurt NASA's feelings either. I'll leave it to you {{where you want it}} on the vessel.|$|E
5|$|The eponymous {{protagonist of}} the series is Septimus Heap. As the seventh son of a seventh son, the aptly named Septimus has {{exceptional}} magical powers. He shares his birthday with Jenna, his adoptive sister, but is presumed dead at birth by his family. For most of the first novel he appears as Boy 412, a child from the Young Army, where he has spent the first ten {{years of his life}} after DomDaniel attempted to abduct him. Thereafter he is apprentice to the ExtraOrdinary Wizard Marcia Overstrand. He has a mop of curly hair, wears green apprentice robes and has a Dragon Ring on his right hand. In the second novel, he acquires a dragon called Spit Fyre as a pet. According to a review in the Manila Standard Today, the contrast between the caution he has learned from an early age and his longing for the love and affection of a family makes him <b>an</b> <b>intriguing</b> character.|$|E

25|$|She {{also had}} a talent for photography: she left <b>an</b> <b>intriguing</b> {{photographic}} archive from the years she spent living in Moscow during the 1930s and 40s. The archive is the more remarkable because it concerns a time and places where, for both economic and political reasons, very few people would have had access to photographic equipment.|$|E
25|$|The XB-42 was {{developed}} initially {{as a private}} venture; an unsolicited proposal {{was presented to the}} United States Army Air Forces in May 1943. This resulted in an Air Force contract for two prototypes and one static test airframe, the USAAF seeing <b>an</b> <b>intriguing</b> possibility of finding a bomber capable of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress's range without its size or cost.|$|E
25|$|The above {{approach}} can be performed at many sections containing the PETM. This has led to <b>an</b> <b>intriguing</b> result. At some locations (mostly deep-marine), sedimentation rates must have decreased across the PETM, presumably because of carbonate dissolution on the seafloor; at other locations (mostly shallow-marine), sedimentation rates must have increased across the PETM, presumably because of enhanced delivery of riverine material during the event.|$|E

25|$|Uncontroversially, monkeys, apes and humans, {{like many}} other animals, have evolved {{specialised}} mechanisms for producing sound for purposes of social communication. On the other hand, no monkey or ape uses its tongue for such purposes. Our species' unprecedented use of the tongue, lips and other moveable parts seems to place speech in a quite separate category, making its evolutionary emergence <b>an</b> <b>intriguing</b> theoretical challenge {{in the eyes of}} many scholars.|$|E
25|$|The first {{match of}} the night session on the Rod Laver Arena saw local player Casey Dellacqua, who had {{previously}} never progressed beyond the first round at the Australian Open, defeat former champion Amélie Mauresmo 3–6, 6–4, 6–4. Justine Henin struggled to get to grips with Francesca Schiavone before winning; and Nicole Vaidišová and Serena Williams set up <b>an</b> <b>intriguing</b> fourth round match, a re-match of the previous year's semi-final.|$|E
25|$|A {{support group}} {{was formed to}} test these theories. The Military Open Source Software Working Group was {{organized}} in 2009 and held over 120 military members.

25|$|Various {{methods have}} been used to {{identify}} imprinted genes. In swine, Bischoff et al. 2009 compared transcriptional profiles using short-oligonucleotide microarrays to survey differentially expressed genes between parthenotes (2 maternal genomes) and control fetuses (1 maternal, 1 paternal genome). <b>An</b> <b>intriguing</b> study surveying the transcriptome of murine brain tissues revealed over 1300 imprinted gene loci (approximately 10-fold more than previously reported) by RNA-sequencing from F1 hybrids resulting from reciprocal crosses. The result however has been challenged by others who claimed that this is an overestimation by an order of magnitude due to flawed statistical analysis.|$|E
25|$|Ostraca {{dating from}} the Ramesside Period have been found which depict hastily drawn images of {{homosexual}} as well as heterosexual sex. The duo Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum, manicurists in the Palace of King Niuserre during the Fifth Dynasty of Egyptian pharaohs, circa 2400 BC. are speculated to have been gay based on a representation of them embracing nose-to-nose in their shared tomb. King Neferkare and General Sasenet, a Middle Kingdom story, has <b>an</b> <b>intriguing</b> plot revolving around a king's clandestine gay affair {{with one of his}} generals. It may reference the actual Pharaoh Pepi II, who was likely gay.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, Agathocles issued <b>an</b> <b>intriguing</b> range of bilingual coinage, {{displaying}} {{what seems to}} be Buddhist as well as Hindu symbolism. The coins, manufactured according to the Indian standard, using either Brahmi, Greek or Kharoshthi (a first in the Greek world), and displaying symbols of the various faiths in India, tend to indicate a considerable willingness to accommodate local languages and beliefs, to an extent unseen in subsequent Indo-Greek kings. They may be indicative of the considerable efforts of the first Indo-Greek kings to secure support from Indian populations and avoid being perceived as invaders, efforts which may have subsided once the Indo-Greek kingdoms were more securely in place.|$|E

25|$|Than (2007) {{pointed to}} the view of Benny Peiser, a social {{anthropologist}} at Liverpool John Moores University in the UK. In his newsletter, Peiser had cited a blog that had commented on warming observed on several planetary bodies in the Solar system. These included Neptune's moon Triton, Jupiter, Pluto and Mars. In an e-mail interview with Than (2007), Peiser stated that:"I think it is <b>an</b> <b>intriguing</b> coincidence that warming trends have been observed {{on a number of}} very diverse planetary bodies in our solar system, (...) Perhaps this is just a fluke."Than (2007) provided alternative explanations of why warming had occurred on Triton, Pluto, Jupiter and Mars.|$|E
25|$|Following this success, Crowe {{wrote the}} {{screenplay}} for 1984's The Wild Life, the pseudo-sequel to Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Whereas its predecessor followed teenagers' lives in high school, The Wild Life traced {{the lives of}} several teenagers after high school living in an apartment complex. Filmmaker James L. Brooks noticed Crowe's original voice and {{wanted to work with}} him. Brooks executive produced Crowe's first directing effort, 1989's Say Anything..., about a young man pining away for the affections of the seemingly perfect girl. Though it could have easily ended up a formulaic teen love story, Say Anything... got glowing reception from critics. They applauded the way Crowe crafted <b>an</b> <b>intriguing</b> and insightful tale that also involved the girl's relationship with her father and how it is threatened when she discovers he is caught up in a shady business deal.|$|E
25|$|For example, <b>an</b> <b>intriguing</b> {{problem in}} geobiology {{is the role}} of organisms in the global cycling of methane. Genetics has {{revealed}} that the methane monooxygenase gene (pmo) is used for oxidizing methane and is present in all aerobic methane-oxidizers, or methanotrophs. The presence of DNA sequences of the pmo gene in the environment {{can be used as a}} proxy for methanotrophy. A more generalizable tool is the 16S ribosomal RNA gene, which is found in bacteria and archaea. This gene evolves very slowly over time and is not usually horizontally transferred, and so it is often used to distinguish different taxonomic units of organisms in the environment. In this way, genes are clues to organismal metabolism and identity. Genetics enables us to ask 'who is there?' and 'what are they doing?' This approach is called metagenomics.|$|E
