5|$|In 1966, a five-gondola {{train set}} with green-and-white-striped <b>awnings</b> and a five-gondola train set with blue-and-white-striped <b>awnings,</b> {{referred}} to by Disneyland employees as Holiday Green and Holiday Blue respectively, {{were added to the}} DRR's rolling stock. Both train sets had side-facing bench seating like the Holiday Red freight train. By the time that the new Holiday Green and Holiday Blue trains sets were introduced in 1966, the DRR's original roundhouse, located {{on the end of a}} spur line connected to the main line near the Rivers of America in the Frontierland section, had been replaced by a larger roundhouse, located on the end of a new spur line connected to the main line in the Tomorrowland section. The new roundhouse, where the DRR's locomotives and train cars are stored and maintained, was also built to house the storage and maintenance facility for the Disneyland Monorail.|$|E
5|$|In February 2000, {{a tree in}} the Adventureland section {{fell onto}} the DRR's Holiday Red freight train while it was in motion, {{damaging}} the <b>awnings</b> and their supports on the gondolas as well as knocking off the cupola {{on top of the}} caboose before the train came to a stop. No injuries occurred {{as a result of this}} accident.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} station {{building was}} a temporary structure positioned over {{the tracks and}} the platforms were sheltered with individual <b>awnings</b> rather than the all-over glazed roof provided at the DR's other stations. Access to the station was via a passageway from Bridge Street and a pedestrian subway under the road. On 30 May 1870, the railway was extended to Blackfriars.|$|E

50|$|In the 1980s the {{original}} iron posts which supported a convex corrugated iron <b>awning</b> were knocked {{out by a}} bus and the <b>awning</b> and posts were replaced by the current modern <b>awning</b> across the three shops.|$|R
50|$|The street facade, which faces {{approximately}} north northeast, is symmetrically arranged. It {{consists of}} a skillion roofed footpath <b>awning</b> supported by five timber posts, a glazed shopfront below the <b>awning</b> and a decorative parapet wall above. A flat ceiling lines {{the underside of the}} <b>awning.</b>|$|R
5|$|At Ballast Point, the {{pavilion}} and bathhouse {{were destroyed by}} the storm. Nearby, the Tampa Yacht and Country Club suffered severe damage. Many cars along the waterfront were severely damaged and nearly all flat railroad cars were submerged. The Malloy Line dock was also left under several feet of water. A number of waterfront warehouses were also damaged by floodwaters. After the Tampa Electrical Company power house experienced water damage, the electricity was shutoff. Additionally, the company's cable station was flooded under several feet of water. Winds downed hundreds of trees and sign across roadways and tore-up <b>awnings.</b> At least 50 <b>awnings</b> were ripped from a bank building on Franklin Street alone. Falling trees also damaged {{the post office and}} the YMCA. Almost 500 dwellings in the neighborhood of Ybor City were demolished. Five people were killed in the city, three from people coming into contact with a live wire and the other two from drowning. Only minor damage occurred in Plant City. Throughout Hillsborough County, many county roads were impassible due to downed telegraph poles and other debris, especially between Tampa and Plant City.|$|E
5|$|Further inland, {{moisture}} from Bonnie {{combined with a}} cold front to produce widespread thunderstorms over Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee. In Arkansas, lightning from a severe thunderstorm knocked out power {{to much of the}} city of Rison after striking a transformer. Significant wind damage took place in Dallas County where <b>awnings</b> were blown off homes, structures sustained roof damage, and trees were felled. Heavy rains also triggered localized flash flooding, covering several highways. Throughout the state, storm damage was estimated at $356,000 (2010USD).|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} {{focal point}} of the Cycle Center is an atrium that introduces the two lower levels of facilities and provides an aesthetic above-ground presence. The atrium, which has been praised by Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic Blair Kamin more than once, has a sloping solar paneled roof. The 120solar panels produce 6.5percent of the electricity supply required for the climate-controlled building. The Cycle Center has an opaque design, with thin steel frames for its main windows. The interior design uses stainless steel and blond wood, and shade is produced by <b>awnings.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{ground floor}} facades have been altered to provide {{aluminium}} framed shop fronts. The suspended <b>awning</b> replaced a curved <b>awning</b> {{which had a}} barrel vault emphasising the entry.|$|R
40|$|The {{photograph}} {{shows the}} striped <b>awning</b> used for dining (2 ̆ 2 mess tent 2 ̆ 2) during annual encampment of Miami Military Institute, ca. 1901. A table is set with pitchers and glassware beneath the <b>awning.</b> On {{either side of}} the <b>awning</b> are men wearing aprons with one holding a tray. The <b>awning</b> is situated on land beside a stream and a tent is in the background. Annual encampments were referred to as 2 ̆ 2 Camp MMI 2 ̆ 2. This photograph is from an album in the Martha McClellan Brown Collection. [URL]...|$|R
50|$|The <b>awning</b> is {{supported}} by a row of timber posts positioned {{at the edge of the}} footpath nearest the road. The posts are decorated with timber brackets and double timber posts emphasise the outer corners of the <b>awning.</b> Below the line of the <b>awning</b> are three double hung timber windows facing the street. At the northern end of the street facade are steps leading to the entry porch. Both the <b>awning</b> and the parapet wall extend beyond the main part of the building forming a front for the attached porch. The pitched roof over the entry porch together with the skillion roof of the footpath <b>awning</b> forms an unequal gable facing north which is infilled with timber battens. The porch has a timber balustrade and decorative arches.|$|R
5|$|The {{addition}} of the Grand Canyon Diorama in 1958 prompted changes to the Retlaw 2 freight train pulled by the DRR's No. 1 locomotive, which involved adding side-facing bench seating pointed towards Disneyland and red-and-white striped <b>awnings</b> {{on all of the}} cattle cars and gondolas. The walls on the cattle cars facing the park were also removed to allow for better views of the diorama. That same year, a third gondola with the same modifications as the other gondolas was added, and a fourth gondola with the same attributes was added in 1959. This brought the total number of freight cars in the train set, now referred to by Disneyland employees as Holiday Red, to eight. Prior to these modifications, the cattle cars and gondolas of this train set had no seating, requiring passengers to stand {{for the duration of the}} ride. Despite safety concerns voiced by Ward Kimball related to the lack of seats on these train cars, Walt Disney, for the purpose of authenticity, had insisted that there be no seats on them; he wanted the passengers to feel like cattle on an actual cattle train.|$|E
5|$|In Miami, {{damage was}} minimal, limited to broken windows and <b>awnings.</b> In Hollywood and Fort Lauderdale, windows and roofs were damaged, {{although}} damage was still fairly minor. Numerous {{power lines and}} telephone wires were downed in the latter. Northward, from Pompano Beach to Jupiter, buildings suffered serious damage from the heavy winds and 10ft (3m) storm surge. Nearly all small frame houses were destroyed in Deerfield Beach, while several citizens estimated that at least 50% of homes were demolished. The town's post office, depot, and an entire business block were also destroyed. An eight-year-old boy drowned in a ditch near where his family sought refuge. In Boca Raton, two garages and several houses were destroyed. At the Cloister Inn, windows were shattered and the roof was damaged; across the street, 32freight cars belonging to a train along the Florida East Coast Railway were tossed by the wind into a nearby ditch. A short distance to the north, a warehouse was flattened. A building occupied by a restaurant and a store was flattened. In Delray Beach, four churches suffered severe damage and the Alta Repp and Seacrest hotels both lost {{a portion of their}} roof. The police reported three deaths within the city. In Delray Beach and Lantana, all houses and the railroad station were badly damaged. In Boynton Beach, about 75% of businesses suffered complete destruction. Fifteen people were injured by a roof collapse while taking refuge in the auditorium of a high school.|$|E
25|$|Footscray {{has some}} fine 1930s Art Deco buildings, most in {{disrepair}} and hidden behind shop signs and <b>awnings.</b>|$|E
50|$|An <b>awning</b> with pressed metal {{ceilings}} cantilevers {{over the}} footpath {{on the main}} facades facing Wickham and Ballow Streets. Below the <b>awning</b> the external wall of the ground floor is finished with mosaic tiles, now painted. The walls above the <b>awning</b> are rendered and lined to suggest stonework and are embellished by horizontal bands at the sill and impost levels of the windows.|$|R
5000|$|Six timber posts {{fixed to}} raised {{concrete}} footings support a later metal sheeted timber framed <b>awning</b> over the footpath. Centred {{in the wall}} above the <b>awning,</b> four pairs of two light Casement windows provide natural light and ventilation to the projection room. Fixed above the windows is an <b>awning</b> and above that is signage bearing the name: [...] "Majestic Theatre".|$|R
40|$|Conference Name: 2 nd International Conference on Advances in Materials and Manufacturing Processes (ICAMMP 2011). Conference Address: Guilin, PEOPLES R CHINA. Time:DEC 16 - 18, 2011. This paper {{developed}} an {{automatic control system}} for folding arm <b>awning</b> based on environmental factors, which can overcome the disadvantages of the traditional <b>awning</b> of unitary control mode and low level of intelligence. The system consists of sensor unit, controller, drive motor and transmission mechanism. The sensor unit is used for testing light intensity, wind speed and rain, then an AT 89 S 52 SCM single-chip microcomputer which {{is the core of}} the controller is applied to receive testing signal and send instructions to AC motor to realize the extending and withdrawing state of the <b>awning</b> according to the corresponding control logic. Meanwhile, this system is able to switch from automatic control to manual control so as to deal with power outage and other special situation and maintain operation of <b>awning.</b> The results of the prototype test show that this system is running steadily and can adjust the working condition of the <b>awning</b> in time according to the environment change. Compared with the current electric <b>awning,</b> the intelligent folding arm <b>awning</b> controlled according to environmental factors can achieve more energy conservation and environmental protection...|$|R
25|$|Elevated (above-street) stations, in {{particular}} on lines 2 and 6, are built in brick and covered by platform <b>awnings</b> (line 2) or glass canopies (line 6).|$|E
25|$|In June 1958 the Commissioner {{reported}} that new concrete and brick station buildings were under construction at Sherwood, Graceville, Chelmer, Indooroopilly and Auchenflower, and subways were completed or under construction at Graceville, Chelmer, Taringa and Nundah. The Graceville complex of station building, <b>awnings</b> and subway, and enlarged and raised platforms {{at a cost}} of £16,686, was the first of these new stations to open in mid-1959. Chelmer, with an identical layout of one building and four <b>awnings,</b> all butterfly-roofed, opened shortly afterwards. Milton, also drawn by Jan Kral was built in 1960.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} market squares. The Hellenistic Agora of the Competaliasts by the Sacred Harbour retains the postholes for market <b>awnings</b> in its stone paving. Two {{powerful}} Italic merchant guilds dedicated statues and columns there.|$|E
50|$|In 1935 {{the hotel}} {{underwent}} alterations and additions, the architect was John Patrick Donoghue and the contractor J Corbett. The hotel's curved, post-supported <b>awning</b> was probably {{replaced with the}} flat cantilevered <b>awning</b> at this time.|$|R
50|$|At street level, the Regent Building {{frontage}} {{is divided}} in two, {{with access to}} the entrance hall on the right hand side and a small retail tenancy on the left. The facade under the <b>awning</b> is largely clad in marble with a strip of modern signage running as a frieze above the doorways. The <b>awning</b> cantilevers over the Queen Street Mall by approximately three metres with metal tie rods providing support from above. Otherwise clad in metal roof sheeting, the underside to the <b>awning</b> features contoured metal-sheet housing for numerous rows of light bulbs. Several recent illuminated signs hang from here. An ornamental leadlight fringe runs along the south-west and north-west edges of the <b>awning.</b> Dating from the heyday of the theatre, this decoration, aside from other features of the <b>awning,</b> is considered to be of heritage significance.|$|R
50|$|Of {{the five}} shops, {{only the two}} {{occupied}} by the Commonwealth Bank have been substantially altered internally. The shops' original flat <b>awning</b> with signage along the street frontage has been replaced with a convex sheet metal <b>awning.</b>|$|R
25|$|PEANUTS Showplaceis {{an outdoor}} venue that {{is next to}} the PEANUTS Playhouse in Planet Snoopy. It {{features}} stadium bench seating, with <b>awnings</b> to provide shade, {{and a lot of}} room for the interactive entertainment.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} is plastered and whitewashed. A choir {{is located on}} arched corbels with wooden balustrades accessible from a door to the right. Meanwhile the sub-choir with wooden <b>awnings,</b> is accessible from the right arm of the Santa Casa da Misericórdia alongside a baptismal fountain.|$|E
25|$|The quadruplication project, however, was continued. Track layouts were {{produced}} by the Permanent Way and Works team, Graceville being drawn in 1955. To accommodate the new works at this station, a number of partial resumptions were undertaken in Appel Street, where two houses and the house/shop {{on the corner of}} Verney Avenue were moved east on their allotments. Railway plans indicate a very busy shopping precinct along the opposite roadway, Honour Avenue. The new station layout allowed for one wide suburban island platform, on which a new station building and two <b>awnings</b> with integral seating were to be built, and one narrow main-line island platform, which was to house two <b>awnings</b> with more integral seating. The station structures were designed to fit the layouts.|$|E
50|$|A street <b>awning</b> runs {{across the}} front of the entire building. The ceiling of the {{right-hand}} section of <b>awning</b> is pressed metal; the ceiling of the left-hand section is ripple iron. Above both shop-fronts are coloured glass fanlights.|$|R
50|$|Solemya velum, {{commonly}} known as the Atlantic <b>awning</b> clam, is a species of marine bivalve mollusc in the family Solemyidae, the <b>awning</b> clams. This species is found along the eastern coast of North America, from Nova Scotia to Florida.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] {{photographs}} shows a {{loading area}} under a wide cantilevered, skillion <b>awning</b> along the River Street frontage of the [...] warehouse {{and part of}} the 1899 office building; however, no evidence of this <b>awning</b> and loading dock appears to survive.|$|R
25|$|The {{structure}} is supported on cylindrical reinforced concrete pillars. The gabled roof and corrugated iron <b>awnings</b> run the lengths and breadths of the shelter. There is a gallery at the rear, accessed {{by a set}} of stairs on the eastern side. The ground is covered in bitumen.|$|E
25|$|The Eureka Tent & Awning Company {{was founded}} {{sometime}} before 1895 in Binghamton, New York. The company’s first workshop on Binghamton’s Commercial Avenue originally produced custom tents, <b>awnings,</b> wagon covers, horse blankets, and flags. The company employed early manufacturing processes, such as using dies to cut stars and sewing together strips {{of red and}} white bunting to make American flags. Eureka fashioned its first <b>awnings</b> out of unfinished natural white cotton duck and designed them to maximize the amount of light allowed into the storefront while still providing adequate shade to passers-by. Eureka’s earliest tents, assembled from untreated white army duck, were so sturdy that one completely usable early Eureka tent still hung in the company’s headquarters nearly one hundred years later.|$|E
25|$|The main {{shopping}} strip {{runs along}} Marrickville Road, west from Sydenham {{to the town}} hall. Typical businesses include cafés, grocery and clothing stores. Marrickville Road {{is well known for}} the artworks, by Ces Camilleri of Creative Artistic Steel, that adorn the <b>awnings</b> of some of its businesses, which gives the strip a unique style. The shopping strip also extends south along Illawarra Road, past the railway station, to 'The Warren' locality.|$|E
50|$|Solemya borealis, Common {{name the}} Boreal <b>awning</b> clam, is {{a species of}} {{saltwater}} clam, a marine bivalve mollusc in the family Solemyidae the <b>awning</b> clams. This species is found along the northeastern coast of North America, from Nova Scotia to Connecticut.|$|R
50|$|Abutting {{the front}} of the main {{building}} and extending to the east is a two storeyed building of brick construction with an <b>awning</b> to the southern elevation. Together with other structures it encloses a quadrangle in front of the main building. The laboratory building has been constructed in two phases, evident in differences in the brickwork and window forms. Entrance to the upper floor is via a later constructed external brick stair at the eastern end of the southern side of the building. The <b>awning</b> is supported by circular steel posts and has a small valance similar to that on the <b>awning</b> on the main building. A valance of the same design decorates the <b>awning</b> over the entrance stairs.|$|R
50|$|A velarium ("curtain") was {{a type of}} <b>awning</b> used in Roman times. It {{stretched}} over {{the whole of the}} cavea, the seating area in the Colosseum, to protect spectators from the elements. Precisely how the <b>awning</b> was supported is a matter of conjecture.|$|R
