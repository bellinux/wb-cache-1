5|$|Living in the Material World {{is notable}} for the uncompromising lyrical content of its songs, {{reflecting}} Harrison's struggle for spiritual enlightenment against {{his status as}} a superstar, as well <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> many commentators consider to be the finest guitar and vocal performances of his career. In contrast with All Things Must Pass, Harrison scaled down the production for Material World, using a core group of musicians comprising Nicky Hopkins, Gary Wright, Klaus Voormann and Jim Keltner. Ringo Starr, John Barham and Indian musician Zakir Hussain were among the album's other contributors.|$|E
25|$|The 1977 {{match is}} memorable less for what {{happened}} during the game itself <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> happened on the park after the game. The Scottish fans invaded the pitch, ripping up large sections of it and tearing down the goalposts. This incident contributed towards the growing awareness of football hooliganism in the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|The book is as {{intriguing}} for {{the themes}} it leaves out <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> it includes: the Ark of the Covenant, which is given so much {{importance in the}} stories of Moses and Joshua, is almost entirely missing, cooperation between the various tribes is limited, {{and there is no}} mention of a central shrine for worship and only limited reference to a High Priest of Israel (the office to which Aaron was appointed at the end of the Exodus story).|$|E

Thor clenched his hands on the shaft of the hammer so that the knuckles went white, and the peasant did as one might expect, and all his household, they cried out fervently, begged for grace, offered to atone with all their possessions.|$|E
25|$|In the US, the Cult, now {{consisting}} of Astbury, Duffy, Stewart, Warner and Kid Chaos, {{were supported by}} the then-unknown Guns N' Roses. The band also appeared at Roskilde Festival in Denmark in June 1987. When the world tour wound through Australia, the band wrecked £30,000 worth of equipment, {{and as a result}} they could not tour Japan, as no company would rent them new equipment. At the end of the tour the Electric album had been certified Gold in the UK, and sold roughly 3 million copies worldwide, but the band were barely speaking to each other by then. Haggis left the band {{at the end of the}} Electric tour to form the Four Horsemen for Rubin's Def American label. Astbury and Duffy fired Warner and their management team Grant/Edwards, and moved to Los Angeles with original bassist Stewart. Warner sued the band several times for his firing, as well <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> he felt were unpaid royalties due to him for his performance on the Electric album, resulting in lengthy court battles. The Cult signed a new management deal and wrote 21 new songs for their next record.|$|E

He provided the first axiomatic measure-theoretic description of coin-tossing, which was to influence the full axiomatization of probability by the Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov a decade later. Steinhaus was also the first to offer precise definitions of what it means for two events to be [...] "independent", as well <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> it means for a random variable to be [...] "uniformly distributed".|$|E

I don't have that information. But in general, our people take great care in making decisions based on the information that they have at the time. Premier Shawn Graham said [...] "I just want to extend sympathies to the affected families. This is a tragic situation for the community of Bathurst and our province." [...] Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper said the incident had [...] "shocked the nation" [...] and called for a day of mourning. Valery Vienneau, Bishop of Bathurst, read a message on behalf of Pope Benedict XVI stating: [...] " [...] expresses sentiments of deep sympathy and spiritual closeness to the members of their families and to all staff and students who have been touched by this tragedy. The Pope assures all concerned of his prayers for those who died and for their families." ...|$|E
500|$|Garfield {{took up the}} {{practice}} of law in 1865 as a means to improve his personal finances. His efforts took him to Wall Street where, the day after Lincoln's assassination, a riotous crowd led him into an impromptu speech to calm it: [...] "Fellow citizens! Clouds and darkness are round about Him! His pavilion is dark waters and thick clouds of the skies! Justice and judgment are the establishment of His throne! Mercy and truth shall go before His face! Fellow citizens! God reigns, and the Government at Washington still lives!" [...] The speech, with no mention or praise of Lincoln, was according to Garfield biographer Robert G. Caldwell [...] "...quite as significant for what it did not contain <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> it did." [...] In the following years, Garfield had more praise for Lincoln; a year after the Illinoisan's death Garfield stated that, [...] "Greatest among all these developments were the character and fame of Abraham Lincoln," [...] and in 1878 called Lincoln [...] "...one of the few great rulers whose wisdom increased with his power." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, Keith Phipps {{rated the}} episode an A-, finding it [...] "almost like an {{extension}} of the pilot". Phipps felt the scene featuring Mulder's kidnapping to be [...] "one of the scariest moments from the series' early days, as much for what it suggests <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> it shows". Writing for website Den of Geek, Matt Haigh reviewed the episode positively, praising its decision not to answer all of the questions that it asks. Haigh noted that [...] "the fact that we are left as clueless about what really happened as Mulder and Scully only enhances the viewing experience", finding such mystery to be [...] "a rare thing indeed" [...] on network television. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five, finding it to be [...] "much more confident in its pacing and tone" [...] than the previous episode. Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode was [...] "a skilfully scripted story of cover-up and paranoia", and noted that [...] "it sets up the overall themes of the show so well, it almost seems like a primer".|$|E

500|$|Poptimal Tanya Lane wrote, [...] "Wow…just wow. Grey's Anatomy {{has once}} again managed to shock with its season finale." [...] While she {{appreciated}} the [...] "realism and authenticity that Grey's is known for", she found the episode was [...] "almost too much" [...] as it was [...] "extremely gory and difficult to watch, initially because of the grisly wounds" [...] but later because of the [...] "heavy and emotional things that transpired". She thought Pompeo gave one of her best performances when her character learned that her sister was dead. Digital Spy Ben Lee found Leigh's and Dane's performances [...] "phenomenal" [...] and added that he had probably never seen a better performance from Dane. He described the moment the two actors shared as [...] "truly poignant". To him, Lexie's death felt like a finale, which was thus too early. <b>As</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> was happening in Seattle Grace, {{he thought it was}} [...] "a bit pointless" [...] and [...] "uninteresting" [...] except Altman's departure, which he deemed [...] "the most significant moment at the hospital". Entertainment Weekly Tanner Stransky commented of Lexie's death: [...] "It was an intense death. I mean, how awful was it to watch one of Grey’s longest-running characters pass away so quickly -- and rather unceremoniously? I get that Ms. Rhimes had to do what she had to do -- and every show needs to be shaken up once in a while -- but I don't love that Lexie was the one to die. Could it have been someone less important somehow? I guess it would have been too obvious to do Kepner. And you probably just don't kill off a hottie like Mark Sloan, right?" [...] Stransky also complained about Robbins' screams {{at the beginning of the}} episode, but enjoyed Bailey's story.|$|E

2500|$|Many social {{scientists}} including economist Michael Zweig and sociologist Dennis Gilbert contend that middle class persons usually have above median incomes. As social classes lack clear boundaries and overlap {{there are no}} definite income thresholds <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> is considered middle class. In 2004, sociologist Leonard Beeghley identifies a male making $57,000 and a female making $40,000 with a combined households income of $97,000 as a typical middle-class family. In 2005, sociologists William Thompson and Joseph Hickey estimate an income range of roughly $35,000 to $75,000 for the lower middle class and $100,000 or more for the upper middle class.|$|E
