5000|$|Kodak's {{proposed}} rule {{rests on}} a factual assumption about the cross-elasticity of demand in the equipment and aftermarkets: [...] "If Kodak raised its parts or service prices above competitive levels, potential customers would simply stop buying Kodak equipment. Perhaps Kodak {{would be able to}} increase short term profits through such a strategy, but at a devastating cost to its long term interests."Kodak argues that the Court should accept, as a matter of law, this [...] "basic economic reality" [...] that competition in the equipment market necessarily prevents market power in the aftermarkets.Even if Kodak could not raise the price of service and parts one cent without losing equipment sales, that fact would not disprove market power in the <b>aftermarkets.</b> The sales of even a monopolist are reduced when it sells goods at a monopoly price, but the higher price more than compensates for the loss in sales. Kodak's claim that charging more for service and parts would be [...] "a short-run game" [...] is based on the false dichotomy that there are only two prices that can be charged—a competitive price or a ruinous one.But there could easily be a middle, optimum price at which the increased revenues from the higher priced sales of service and parts would more than compensate for the lower revenues from lost equipment sales. The fact that the equipment market imposes a restraint on prices in the <b>aftermarkets</b> by no means disproves the existence of power in those markets. Thus, contrary to Kodak's assertion, there is no immutable physical law—no [...] "basic economic reality"—insisting that competition in the equipment market cannot coexist with market power in the <b>aftermarkets.</b>|$|R

50|$|In sum, {{there is}} a {{question}} of fact whether information costs and switching costs foil the simple assumption that the equipment and service markets act as pure complements to one another. We conclude, then, that Kodak has failed to demonstrate that respondents' inference of market power in the service and parts markets is unreasonable, and that, consequently, Kodak is entitled to summary judgment. It is clearly reasonable to infer that Kodak has market power to raise prices and drive out competition in the <b>aftermarkets,</b> since respondents offer direct evidence that Kodak did so.|$|R

Key for these results is the observation that high prices for spare parts entail a negative external effect inasmuch as liability obligations imply that consumers of competing products {{have to pay the}} high prices as well. <b>aftermarkets,</b> monopolization, liability...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This thesis {{analyzes}} why products {{become increasingly}} heterogenous in both their physical and qualitative {{appearances in the}} modern market economy. Among the important causes, competition from outside goods, non-uniform but concentrated consumer distributions, and competition and cooperation, are studied for the demonstration of their economic implications. The applications are twofold. First, there are the incentives of durable-goods producers to tie their <b>aftermarkets</b> with their primary markets, and the social consequences of that action. Second, there are the international trade policies of standardization. The analysis focuses on whether a domestic durable-goods producer, being a quality follower and incumbent, will agree on standardizing its products with a foreign durable-goods producer, under international competition and government protection. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model in}} which a good {{is made up of}} two parts, and each part asts one or two periods, with known probabilities. The analysis includes consumer decisions regarding part replacement, as well as profit maximization under monopoly and oligipoly. It is found that firms have incentives to supply all part for replacement, rather than force the consumer to replace the entire good when a single part is needed. In oligopoly, the non-collusive equilibrium when parts are not compatible acress brands involves pricing entire goods below marginal cost and individual parts above marginal cost. The paper also puts forward a testable hypothesis about the auto parts market, namely that the emergence of generic auto parts in the 1980 s and 1990 s may have not only driven down the prices of parts with which they competed, but also driven up the prices of other parts. replacement parts, capital replacement, <b>aftermarkets,</b> compatibility, antitrust. ...|$|R

Fifteen years later, {{there have been two}} District Court opinions, two from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and one from the Supreme Court. Since the initial Supreme Court opinion in Kodak, there have been at least seven closely related Appeals Court opinions, and they stand in sharply divided conflict on the question of market power in <b>aftermarkets</b> [...] After the final appeal decision, another area of controversy and conflict between courts has emerged {{on the extent to which}} antitrust law restricts the use of protected intellectual property.
