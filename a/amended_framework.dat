40|$|To {{what extent}} do asylum {{decisions}} within the EU amount to an EU asylum policy? The paper tackles the question within a simplified and <b>amended</b> <b>framework</b> recommended by Lasswell and McDougal’s policy analysis (the amendment is that the postulation of basic public order goals has three interrelated functions: the explication of evaluative assumptions entertained by a policy analyst; the articulation, appraisal, revision and ordering of the assumptions, which result in a prescription of public order goals; the identification and ordering, from among a potentially endless flow of empirical data, of those decisions that conform to the postulated goals). The principal postulated goal is human dignity or a free society. Subordinate goals include the right to life, the right to freedom, the rule of law, and solidarity. The analysis of tendencies in decision, although exhaustive, does not suffice to give an unequivocal answer to the principal question. A major reason is a discrepancy between the EU treaties and directives on asylum, which allegedly are the basic and the implementing EU instruments respectively. However, {{it is apparent that}} minimum standards are an insufficient incentive for the proper harmonisation of national asylum systems, and leave a too high level of discretion to the member states regarding the transposition of the legal acquis into national systems. The Europeanization of asylum policy has not been inspired by humanitarian considerations, but by policies of the member states to discourage and prevent asylum seekers to access state territories on the one hand, and to promptly and efficiently process asylum applications on the other. European institutions will probably keep putting efforts into the building of the Common Asylum System and harmonisation of national asylum systems, particularly {{in the direction of the}} establishment of a single procedure and uniform refugee status at the level of the entire Union. However, the question now arises as to what degree the member states will actually harmonise their national asylum systems with the specified higher standards. Even an appropriate asylum system will be of little importance if it is not accompanied by specific measures that allow for the possibility of access to the asylum system and protection in the EU territory. Changes in the policy of management of the external borders, which restricts access to the asylum policy in various ways, are necessary so as to ensure full respect for the right to seek asylum...|$|E

"AHR/ (Freizeitsportleiterin/ Freizeitsportleiter) (Biologie/Sport) " an Berufskollegs, der {{additive}} doppeltqualifizierende Bildungsgang "Fachsportleiter/ AHR" an Gymnasien und der doppeltqualifizierende integrative Bildungsgang "Übungsleiter Breitensport/ AHR" bzw. "ÜL-C/ AHr an Gymnasien und Gesamschulen. Abstract The present dissertation “Between {{the training}} of exercise instructors and the education of sports teacher” describes three dual-qualification sports courses between 1976 and 2010 {{in the state of}} NW: the integrated “Leisure sporting director (full time) /AHR” course at secondary schools (1976 - 1986) or “AHR/(leisure sporting director) (sport, biology) ” at vocational colleges (1996 to present), the additive “Specialist sporting director/AHR” course at grammar schools (1976 - 1986) and the integrative “Trainer for popular sports/AHR” course (1986 - 2006) or “Trainer-C/ AHR” course at secondary schools with preparatory college level and grammar schools (2007 -present). The courses’ prototypical academic models are conceptually researched and documented for general and vocational learning in upper secondary education. The paper identifies developments and modifications from the definitive beginnings in 1976 to 2010, and describes course continuity and change in the context of legitimacy in educational administration (NW Ministry for Education and Culture) and sports-policy management (NW State Sports Confederation). The dual-qualification integrated “Leisure sporting director/AHR” course offered at secondary schools between 1976 and 1986 is distinguished by successful integration of general and career-based education, combining study-oriented and vocational learning. The main subject (“teaching methods in sports education”), extracurricular internships, work experience and demonstration lessons emphasise the vocational component of the course, and successfully facilitate the role change “from student to teacher” intended in the qualification process. As part of their training, leisure sporting directors acquire sports and career-based skills (professional and methodological competence), as well as personal skills such as initiative, social skills and conflict resolution. The introduction of vocational colleges in 1999 change the structure of the dual-qualification “AHR (leisure sporting director) (sport, biology) ” course; abolition of the didactic planning criterion regarding the interdisciplinary nature of core subjects in career-based general learning is a qualitative loss. Although the classes in the dual-qualification “Specialist sporting director/AHR” course offered at grammar schools between 1976 and 1986 with 6 hours a week in the major subject of sport and 3 additional hours a week for the double qualification seek to combine theory with practice and achieve interdisciplinary learning between the subjects, content-related adjustments are limited to the six-hour major subject of sport and the three-hour additional course. Basic courses and majors cannot be specifically interlinked due to the framework layout and the status of the major subject (sport) in upper secondary education. The vocational internships as places of learning for the role change seem false, and the additional three-hour class also proves to be very time-consuming for students of the dual-qualification “Specialist sporting director/AHR” course. Apart from resulting in a certificate of secondary school completion and tertiary entrance (AHR), the dual-qualification integrative “Trainer for popular sports/AHR” course or “Trainer-C/AHR” course” at comprehensive schools and grammar schools also seeks to provide a vocational qualification enabling students to engage in extracurricular activities as well as have the opportunity to choose a university course. To accentuate the career-based component, the stipulated AHR-focused sports-major content is coupled with mandatory training content set by the NW State Sports Confederation and other educational training elements such as extracurricular internships, work experience and demonstration lessons in the major subject of sport. The dual-qualification “Trainer-C/AHR” course pools many new practical sports experiences, and seeks to build on reflection and judgement skills, and develop basic attitudes and behaviours for academic/scientific work. However, the major subject of sports engineering means there are not enough opportunities to address content in a more advanced context. It is not possible to further problematise the course’s intended role change “from student to teacher” due to the low number of allotted hours. Research conducted from 1976 to 2010 shows that all dual-qualification sports courses undergo “metamorphoses” in their structural developments from their early days to the present. Two significant factors determine the content and structure of the respective courses: - Changes resulting from new decisions made by the NW Ministry for Education and Culture in relation to educational administration, and - The influences of sports-policy management by the NW State Sports Confederation Decisions made by the Kultusministerkonferenz (KMK) between 1990 and 1999, decrees enacted by the NW Ministry for Education and Culture, ordinances and administrative regulations issued by the district government and new curriculums in subsequent years {{have a significant impact on}} the content and organisational structure of the dual-qualification “AHR/(Leisure sporting director) (sport, biology) course. The “Ordinance on training and assessments in vocational college courses (APO-BK) ” is enacted in 1999, and is followed in 2006 by the “Curriculums for trialling vocational college courses”, which lead to a vocational qualification under state law and a certificate of secondary school completion and tertiary entrance (AHR). The new specialised sport syllabus for vocational colleges in the state of NW from 2006 onwards also changes the course’s profile. Making matters more difficult is the content intensification and restriction on subject matter resulting from general Abitur (German school-leaving certificate) regulations in 2007. Trends arising in the 1980 s, which see fewer and fewer trained sports teachers with university degrees obtain employment in the public sector, instead being forced into alternative fields, lead to a change in thinking in educational administration, and a gradual withdrawal from the pilot project for specialist sporting directors. Introduction of the New Sports Directives in 1980 / 81, with their mandatory restrictive organisational models 6 : 0 or 4 : 2, no longer permits a wide range of specialised sports in the course, resulting in a loss of individuality. The lack of recognition in the licensing structures of the Deutscher Sportbund (DSB) and Landessportbund (LSB) sports organisation proves to be problematic., and there are ongoing complaints about licences being denied by professional and sports associations at the LSB for specialist sporting directors. The dual-qualification “Specialist sporting director/AHR” course is abolished in 1986. The profile of the dual-qualification “Trainer for popular sports/AHR” course from 1986, known as the “Trainer-C/AHR” course in 2007, also undergoes structural changes as a result of administrative regulations. While the development phases of 1986 - 1998 still involve integrative didactic course profile planning and content co-ordination between school, ministers of education and culture, and the LSB, essential elements of the “Trainer-C/AHR” course are relinquished by virtue of the new regulations and sports curriculums for upper secondary education in 1999, the reduction of the major subject (sport) to 5 hours a week, and the subsequent introduction of the mandatory combination of mathematics and sport for the Abitur (German school-leaving certificate). During the 1990 s, the LSB, as a partner of the major subject (sport), also releases a series of new, modified mandatory approaches to trainer qualifications and <b>amended</b> <b>framework</b> conditions, which entail establishing new didactic sports course profiles in the interests of the dual qualification. The LSB’s training approach to dual qualifications changes, and it gradually abandons its responsibility for the dual-qualification “Trainer-C/AHR” course...|$|E

Community-based forestry has taken multiple forms, depending on the assortment of land-tenure systems, forest-use norms, wood demand, and social organization, among others factors. Nature, Wealth, and Power is an analytical framework that has been developed from experiences in natural resource management in Africa. In this paper, we <b>amend</b> the <b>framework</b> to People, Nature, Wealth, and Power (PNWP), and propose it as an analytical lens for community-based {{forest management}} initiatives. We use the PNWP framework to assess the responsiveness of contractual forest management in the Menabe region of Madagascar {{to the interests of}} local communities, the state forest agency, and conservation nongovernmental organizations. Findings indicate that members of each of the three groups hold some differing interests, which may result in conflict over time. Specifically, interests converge around the Nature and Wealth categories and diverge around the People and Power categories. Also, the contract mechanism for community-based forest management currently being implemented in Menabe does not account for the People and Wealth interests held by any of the three groups. More research is needed, but our inquiry indicates the PNWP framework holds promise for assessing community-based forest management initiatives...|$|R

Since the tribal museum movement of the 1960 s and 1970 s, tribal museums and cultural centers have adopted Western collections management and curatorial museum practices and policies, often operating under pre-established museum models that contrasted against world and cultural views of Native people. Although much can be learned from Western collections and curatorial practice and policy, Native American worldviews and beliefs presented an alternative to the approach of Western practice and policy. Data was collected through semi-structured, one-on-one interviews conducted with museum staff at O’odham tribal museums. Study results suggested that tribal museum practitioners employed best practices that incorporated both Western frameworks and Native American cultural values, sought to foster connection to their home communities and provided spaces that maintained tribal culture and history. A primary limitation was the small sample of tribal museums studied and findings may not be transferrable to phenomena taking place at tribal museums across the country...|$|R

The existing medical billing framework has national connectivity, and its existing communication, data, and authentication standards are sufficiently expandable {{to serve as a}} necessary backbone for a national health information infrastructure. Doing so offers strategic advantages: (1) providers are already “wired ” and using the billing framework, processing billions of claims a year; (2) the mechanism to check patient insurance eligibility can easily expand to additionally provide relevant patient information (e. g., problems, medications, and allergies) at the time and place of service; (3) a national program already exists that captures quality measures through claims processing; and, (4) payment incentives on claims can drive ongoing provider compliance. Growing independent regional data centers, as has been the primary focus so far, leaves a critical gap in connectivity, data consolidation, national analytics, and timeliness. To close the gap, this paper proposes an <b>amended</b> billing <b>framework</b> (“the Backbone”), and shows how the Backbone can help achieve meaningful uses.

40|$|The {{conventional}} way {{of describing}} grazing in plankton models {{is based on}} a zooplankton functional response framework, according to which the consumption rate is computed as the product of a certain function of food (the functional response) and the density/biomass of herbivorous zooplankton. A large amount of literature on experimental feeding reports the existence of a zooplankton functional response in microcosms and small mesocosms, which goes a long way towards explaining the popularity of this framework both in mean-field (e. g. NPZD models) and spatially resolved models. On the other hand, the complex foraging behaviour of zooplankton (feeding cycles) as well as spatial heterogeneity of food and grazer distributions (plankton patchiness) across time and space scales raise questions as to the existence of a functional response of herbivores in vivo. In the current review, we discuss limitations of the 'classical' zooplankton functional response and consider possible ways to <b>amend</b> this <b>framework</b> to cope with the complexity of real planktonic ecosystems. Our general conclusion is that although the functional response of herbivores often does not exist in real ecosystems (especially in the form observed in the laboratory), this framework can be rather useful in modelling - but it does need some amendment which can be made based on various techniques of model reduction. We also show that the shape of the functional response depends on the spatial resolution ('frame') of the model. We argue that incorporating foraging behaviour and spatial heterogeneity in plankton models would not necessarily require the use of individual based modelling - an approach which is now becoming dominant in the literature. Finally, we list concrete future directions and challenges and emphasize the importance of a closer collaboration between plankton biologists and modellers in order to make further progress towards better descriptions of zooplankton grazing...|$|R

40|$|The {{changed and}} <b>amended</b> {{legislative}} <b>framework</b> {{for education in}} Slovenia has brought a more quality education to children with special educational needs and mild, moderate and severe intellectual disability differences. Pupils with special needs make up a highly vulnerable and maltreated group that is less able to defend and demand its rights {{without the help of}} society. In order to achieve an optimal development of an individual, adequate living conditions should be ensured. This also includes spatial conditions as a medium for the implementation of the “Special Needs Education Programme” that also regulates adequate school furniture, such as table and chair, that meets the special needs of individual. This paper was carried out to examine the fit between the school furniture dimensions and the pupils’ height by analysing the conditions in parent classrooms at three primary schools in the Savinjska region that provide special needs education programme for children with mild, moderate and severe intellectual disability difference. The study involved 89 pupils from the first to the sixth grade that require a special needs education programme but are not physically impaired. The thesis seeks answers to the following questions: [1] whether and how primary schools with special needs education programme adjust the classroom furniture according to the height of the pupils and [2] how the suitability of chairs and tables is determined to meet the need of an individual pupil. The study is focused on comparing the types of school furniture in parent classrooms by the SIST ISO 5970 standard. The results show a high percentage of unsuitable height of furniture in relation to the height of the pupils in the special needs education programme. The analysis attests to the data found in the literature which indicate an extremely high percentage of a mismatch between the children’s anthropometry and the classroom furniture. Consequently, the results call for further reflection of the importance of insuring a proper working environment for a pupil with special needs. ...|$|R

The main focus of Law Sinde, the Spanish IP law as it became known, was to tighten control around individual usage of copyrighted material. To facilitate this, its strategy was to control technological use by intervening on three distinct levels, on the level of the user, the level of institutions and the level of jurisdiction.

The authors’ hypothesis {{comes from the fact that}} in modern conditions, the development and implementation of the strategies of the recreation and tourism industries in the Russian regions can only be effective through the creation and promotion of large diversified knowledge-based competitive regional tourism products at new technological level. The paper clearly demonstrates the group methods of regional strategic planning such as brainstorming and foresight (forecasting and future shaping). The results of the research substantiate not only the need to <b>amend</b> the legislative <b>framework</b> and the current management system of the Russian tourism, to actively elaborate and implement the regional development strategies, to carry out tourism development studies aimed at its commercial success but also the importance of convincing representation of the civilizational advantages of the Russian world and Russian civilization through the tourism...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] Responding to {{the absence}} of an {{international}} treaty expressly protecting people with disabilities, the United Nations General Assembly will soon adopt a disability-based human rights convention. This Article examines the theoretical implications of adding disability to the existing canon of human rights, both for individuals with disabilities and for other under-protected people. It develops a “disability human rights paradigm” by combining components of the social model of disability, the human right to development, and Martha Nussbaum’s version of the capabilities approach, but filters them through a disability rights perspective to preserve that which provides for individual flourishing and modifying that which does not. This Article maintains that Nussbaum’s capabilities approach provides an especially fertile space within which to understand the content of human rights. However, because her scheme excludes some intellectually disabled individuals and conditions the inclusion of others, it falls short of a comprehensive <b>framework.</b> <b>Amending</b> Nussbaum’s capabilities approach to develop the talents of all individuals results in a disability human rights paradigm that recognizes the dignity and worth of every person. This Article also argues that a disability rights paradigm is capable of fortifying human rights in two ways: first, it can reinforce protections afforded to groups already protected, such as women; and second, it can extend protections to people currently not protected, such as sexual minorities and the poor. Ultimately, the disability rights paradigm indicates that human rights protection can progress from a group to an individual basis. Repositioning disability as an inclusive concept embraces disability as a universal human variation rather than an aberration...|$|R

40|$|To protect {{terrestrial}} {{ecosystems and}} humans from contaminants many {{countries and jurisdictions}} have developed soil quality guidelines (SQGs). This study proposes a new framework to derive SQGs and guidelines for amended soils and uses a case study based on phytotoxicity data of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) from field studies to illustrate how the framework could be applied. The proposed framework uses normalisation relationships {{to account for the}} effects of soil properties on toxicity data followed by a species sensitivity distribution (SSD) method to calculate a soil added contaminant limit (soil ACL) for a standard soil. The normalisation equations are then used to calculate soil ACLs for other soils. A soil amendment availability factor (SAAF) is then calculated as the toxicity and bioavailability of pure contaminants and contaminants in amendments can be different. The SAAF is used to modify soil ACLs to ACLs for <b>amended</b> soils. The <b>framework</b> was then used to calculate soil ACLs for copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn). For soils with pH of 4 - 8 and OC content of 1 - 6 %, the ACLs range from 8  mg/kg to 970  mg/kg added Cu. The SAAF for Cu was pH dependant and varied from 1. 44 at pH 4 to 2. 15 at pH 8. For soils with pH of 4 - 8 and OC content of 1 - 6 %, the ACLs for amended soils range from 11  mg/kg to 2080  mg/kg added Cu. For soils with pH of 4 - 8 and a CEC from 5 - 60, the ACLs for Zn ranged from 21 to 1470  mg/kg added Zn. A SAAF of one was used for Zn as it concentrations in plant tissue and soil to water partitioning showed no difference between biosolids and soluble Zn salt treatments, indicating that Zn from biosolids and Zn salts are equally bioavailable to plants.

40|$|The {{development}} of toll roads in Indonesia started around 1978. Initially, {{the management and}} {{development of}} toll roads sat directly under the Government of Indonesia (GoI) being undertaken through PT JasaMarga, a state owned enterprise specifically established to provide toll roads. Due to the slow growth and low capability of toll roads to fulfil infrastructure needs in the first ten years of operation (only 2. 688 kms/year), GoI changed its strategy in 1989 to one of using private sector participation for roads delivery through a Public Private Partnership (PPP) scheme. In this latter period, PT JasaMarga had two roles, both as regulator {{on behalf of the}} private sector as well as being the operator. However, from 1989 to 2004 the growth rate of toll roads actually decreased further to 2. 300 kms/year. Facing this challenge of low growth rate of toll roads, in 2004 GoI changed the toll road management system and the role of regulator was returned to the Government through the establishment of the Toll Road Regulatory Agency (BPJT). GoI also <b>amended</b> the institutional <b>framework</b> to strengthen the toll road management system. Despite the introduction of this new institutional framework, the growth of toll roads still showed insignificant change. This problem in toll road development has generated an urgent need for research into this issue. The aim of the research is to understand the performance of the new institutional framework in enhancing PPP procured toll road development. The methodology of the research was to undertake a questionnaire survey distributed to private sector respondents involved in toll road development. The results of this study show that there are several problems inherent in the institutional framework, but the most significant problem comes from the uncertainty of the function of the strategic executive body in the land expropriation process...|$|R

The evolution and development of international law towards legal personality of indigenous peoples has reinforced and reassured the awareness that for their cultural and environmental protection, their participation at all stages of the decision-making processes regarding their traditional lands and resources is mandatory. The mentioned before can be noted by analyzing the existent connections between the background, objectives and means of implementation, particularly, among the UN Human Rights Committee, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the ILO Convention No. 169, the Rio Summit follow-up activities, the American Convention on Human Rights, the Inter-American Commission and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. In the pursuit of the protection of its cultural heritage and biodiversity, Mexico has shown its compromise by <b>amending</b> its legal <b>framework</b> and ratifying said international human rights standards to protect these places and people that might be compromised by human activities. Nevertheless, also during the last thirty years the cultural integrity of a particular Mexican indigenous people – the Wixárika people - and the environmental protection of the area that contains its sacred sites – route of pilgrimage to Wirikuta - have been jeopardized. This work explores the paradigmatic nexus between conservation and development, since pursuing economic development, Mexico has granted mining concessions within the Wixárika people´s traditional lands without respecting and protecting their right to selfdetermination, free, prior and informed consent and benefit-sharing. In this regard, this master´s thesis discusses the international and regional commitments of human rights that shall be taken into account with the aim to respect and protect indigenous peoples´ rights, mainly those related to the use and enjoyment of its property and indigenous peoples´ right to culture in relation to the environment...|$|R
