5|$|In the {{conclusion}} of his Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, Scottish philosopher David Hume argued that statements that make claims about reality must be verified by experience, <b>and</b> <b>dismissed</b> those that cannot be verified as meaningless. Hume regarded most religious language as unverifiable by experiment and so dismissed it.|$|E
5|$|Matthias visited Slavonia <b>and</b> <b>dismissed</b> the two Bans Nicholas Újlaki and Emeric Zápolya, {{replacing}} them with Jan Vitovec and John Tuz in 1466. Early the following year, he mounted a campaign in Upper Hungary against a band of Czech mercenaries who were {{under the command of}} Ján Švehla and had seized Kosztolány (now Veľké Kostoľany in Slovakia). Matthias routed them and had Švehla and his 150 comrades hanged.|$|E

5|$|On January 13, 1992, Solidarity {{declared}} its first strike against the democratically elected government: a one-hour strike against {{a proposal to}} raise energy prices. Another, two-hour strike took place on December 14. On May 19, 1993, Solidarity deputies proposed a no-confidence motion—which passed—against the government of Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka.

5|$|After the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) began a {{criminal}} inquiry, further autopsies indicated that Tomlinson {{had died from}} internal bleeding caused by blunt force trauma to the abdomen, in association with cirrhosis of the liver. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided not to charge Harwood, because the disagreement {{between the first and}} later pathologists meant they could not show a causal link between the death and alleged assault. That position changed in 2011; after the verdict of unlawful killing, the CPS charged Harwood with manslaughter. He was acquitted in 2012 <b>and</b> <b>dismissed</b> from the service a few months later.|$|E

5|$|Antisemitic {{legislation}} passed in 1933 {{led to the}} removal all of Jewish teachers, professors and officials from the education system. Most teachers were required {{to belong to the}} Nationalsozialistischer Lehrerbund (National Socialist Teachers League; NSLB) and university professors were required to join the National Socialist German Lecturers. Teachers had to take an oath of loyalty and obedience to Hitler and those who failed to show sufficient conformity to party ideals were often reported by students or fellow teachers <b>and</b> <b>dismissed.</b> Lack of funding for salaries led to many teachers leaving the profession and the average class size increased from 37 in 1927 to 43 in 1938 due to the resulting teacher shortage.|$|E
5|$|Brooks {{then took}} a {{petition}} to the General Assembly, asking for a recount. The assembly took up the matter on April 20, 1873 and voted 63 to 9 not to allow Brooks to contest the election. This did not deter Brooks, and he applied to the Arkansas Supreme Court for a writ of quo warranto, and was again denied. They also ruled that state courts had no jurisdiction in the matter, <b>and</b> <b>dismissed</b> the case. They gave a lengthy explanation {{as to why the}} General Assembly should decide contested gubernatorial elections in Joint Session, since they are the directly elected representatives of the people.|$|E
5|$|Commodore Hopkins {{came under}} {{scrutiny}} from Congress over matters unrelated to this action. He had violated his written orders by sailing to Nassau instead of Virginia and the Carolinas, {{and he had}} distributed the goods taken during the cruise to Connecticut and Rhode Island without consulting Congress. He was censured for these transgressions, <b>and</b> <b>dismissed</b> from the Navy in January 1778 after further controversies, including the fleet's failure to sail agayn (a number of its ships suffered from crew shortages, and also became trapped at Providence by the British occupation of Newport late in 1776). American forces were {{not strong enough to}} dislodge the British garrison there, which was also supported by British ships using Newport as a base.|$|E

5|$|Ernouf {{was on an}} {{inspection}} away from this command when Napoleon landed at Cannes. Upon his landing, many of the soldiers of Angoulême's army flocked to Bonaparte's banner, beginning the Hundred Days. The mere news of Napoleon's escape from Elba and the defection {{of some of the}} troops caused Charles, Duke of Angoulême, to panic and capitulate. Ernouf returned to Marseille, where he learned that André Masséna also had chosen the imperial cause, after which he left for Paris. Napoleon rescinded Ernouf's honors and titles, <b>and</b> <b>dismissed</b> him from his post in the military on 15April 1815. After Napoleon's final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, the second restoration of the Bourbons that summer also restored Ernouf's rights and property.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match against Leicestershire, Loxton was given his first chance on English soil. Batting at No. 7, he managed only four before being trapped leg before wicket by Australian {{expatriate}} left arm orthodox spinner Vic Jackson, as Australia amassed 448. He {{then opened the}} bowling and castled home captain Les Berry for one to leave the hosts at 1/1 and take his first wicket on English soil. He also took two catches, both from the bowling of fellow Victorian Doug Ring as the hosts fell for 130. Loxton again opened the bowling in the second innings as Australia enforced the follow on <b>and</b> <b>dismissed</b> the hosts for 147 to seal another innings win. Loxton took 1/11 and 0/12 from six and seven overs respectively.|$|E
5|$|On 17 November 1994 the USAF {{announced}} that Colwell had recommended to Croker that Wang face court-martial and that Halcli receive nonjudicial administrative {{action on the}} dereliction of duty charges. Colwell recommended that the formal dereliction of duty charges be dropped against the other AWACS crew members, but that they could still face nonjudicial action. Croker accepted Colwell's recommendation and ordered Wang to face court-martial <b>and</b> <b>dismissed</b> the criminal charges against the other AWACS crew members except Halcli, who was offered Article 15 action.|$|E

5|$|Sławomir Cenckiewicz {{also said}} that in 1983, when Wałęsa was {{nominated}} for the Nobel Peace Prize, the secret police tried to embarrass him and leaked information about Wałęsa's previous collaboration with the government. By this time though, Wałęsa was already so popular that most Poles {{did not believe the}} official media <b>and</b> <b>dismissed</b> the allegations as a manipulation by the Communist authorities. The book's first print run sold out in Poland within hours. The book received substantial coverage in the media, provoked nationwide debate, and was noted by the international press. Wałęsa vowed to sue the authors but never did.|$|E
5|$|The MCC {{match was}} {{followed}} by Australia's first non-victory of the tour, against Lancashire. Australia were sent in to bat <b>and</b> <b>dismissed</b> for 204, with Bradman bowled by an arm ball from Malcolm Hilton for 11, his first score on the tour below 80. The hosts replied with 182 {{and in the second}} innings, Bradman was again dismissed by Hilton, this time for 43 as the tourists reached 4/259 at the end of play. When Hilton came on, Bradman attempted to seize the initiative and hit him out of the attack, but missed his first two balls. On the third ball, he charged out of his crease and swung across the line, missed, fell over and was stumped. Hilton's achievement garnered widespread press attention, particularly in Lancashire.|$|E
5|$|The {{first to}} file suit over the {{election}} was Judge William M. Harrison, {{who had been on}} the Brooks ticket. He filed a Bill of Equity with the US Circuit Court in Little Rock, claiming he had a right to a seat on the Supreme Court due to the fraudulent election. The Brooks Campaign likewise filed suit in the Circuit Court shortly thereafter on January 7, 1873. Judge H.C. Caldwell heard the Harrison case, and rendered an opinion stating that the Federal Court had no jurisdiction in the matter, <b>and</b> <b>dismissed</b> the case. The Harrison decision resulted in the dismissal of the Brooks case as well.|$|E

5|$|The ispáns of the Transylvanian {{counties}} of Doboka, Hunyad, Kolozs, Küküllő and Torda were not listed among the witnesses of royal charters {{from the beginning}} of the 13thcentury, hinting that their direct connection to the monarchs had by that time been interrupted. Thereafter they were employed by the voivode who appointed <b>and</b> <b>dismissed</b> them at will. Only the heads of Szolnok County remained directly connected to the monarchs for a longer period, until their office was united with the voivodeship in the 1260s. Similarly, the voivodes were simultaneously the ispáns of the nearby Arad County between 1321 and 1412.|$|E
5|$|Upon Ivan's death, he was {{succeeded by}} his simple-minded son Feodor. Unlike his father, Feodor had no enthusiasm in {{maintaining}} exclusive trading rights with England. Feodor declared his kingdom {{open to all}} foreigners, <b>and</b> <b>dismissed</b> the English ambassador Sir Jerome Bowes, whose pomposity had been tolerated by the new Tsar's late father. Elizabeth sent a new ambassador, Dr. Giles Fletcher, to demand from the regent Boris Godunov that he convince the Tsar to reconsider. The negotiations failed, due to Fletcher addressing Feodor {{with two of his}} titles omitted. Elizabeth continued to appeal to Feodor in half appealing, half reproachful letters. She proposed an alliance, something which she had refused to do when offered one by Feodor's father, but was turned down.|$|E
5|$|Vinícius Segalla from UOL said {{tax credits}} and BNDES {{resources}} are public money and that the concession of those resources to Corinthians are unclear. The federal government dismissed the notion, saying that tax credits are intended to encourage economical growth and work opportunities for the areas surrounding the stadia. The city government said tax credits are not subsidies and the stadium will {{be a boon to}} the city, especially the east zone. They also said subsidies given to the Brazilian Grand Prix and Carnaval among others also bring benefits to the city. Public Prosecutor Marcelo Milani contested the validity of tax credits issued by the city and sued then-mayor Gilberto Kassab for R$1.74billion; the judges said Milani's case was without merit <b>and</b> <b>dismissed</b> it.|$|E
