5|$|Her {{journeys}} {{into the}} land of slavery put her at tremendous risk, and she {{used a variety of}} subterfuges to avoid detection. Tubman once disguised herself with a bonnet and carried two live chickens to give the appearance of running errands. Suddenly finding herself walking toward a former owner in Dorchester County, she yanked the strings holding the birds' legs, and their agitation allowed her to avoid eye contact. Later she recognized a fellow train passenger as another former master; she snatched a nearby newspaper <b>and</b> <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> read. Since Tubman was known to be illiterate, the man ignored her.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{budget was}} so small that during the 32 days of {{shooting}} in Eugene, mostly in November, Landis had no trailer or office and could not watch dailies for three weeks. His wife Deborah Nadoolman purchased most of the costumes at local thrift stores, and she and Judy Belushi made the party togas. Landis and Bruce McGill staged a scene for reporters visiting the set where the director pretended to be angry at the actor for being difficult on the set. Landis grabbed a breakaway pitcher and smashed it over McGill's head. He {{fell to the ground}} <b>and</b> <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> be unconscious. The reporters were completely fooled, and when Landis asked McGill to get up, he refused to move.|$|E

25|$|The {{numerous}} {{laws against}} pagans {{seems to have}} had only limited immediate effect in stamping out the old religion. Many people simply conformed outwardly <b>and</b> <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> become Christian while secretly continuing to practice their beliefs. The numerous laws against apostasy, that had been continuously promulgated since the time of Gratian and Theodosius, is evidence that the emperors were having a hard time even keeping Christians from going astray.|$|E

25|$|Punky's {{efforts to}} escape from Fenster {{included}} a trick pulled by Margaux, in which she dressed up <b>and</b> <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> be Punky. Despite advocacy from Mike Fulton, Chillings placed Punky with a new foster family: the fabulously wealthy Jules and Tiffany Buckworth (Robert Casper and Joan Welles), the latter of whom did not take kindly at all to Punky's working-class playfulness. Things gradually returned to normal: Henry, {{back on his feet}} following surgery, opened up a glitzy new studio at the local mall; in the process, he reunited with Punky. At the conclusion of the story arc, Henry officially adopted Punky.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} Owen's {{tactical}} mind {{was seen in}} one of his early international matches against England in 1902. Wales were behind in the game with little time remaining when Owen tricked his opposite number, Bernard Oughtred, into an off-side tackle near the English posts. With the Welsh in charge of the scrum on the English '25', Owen told his forwards, in Welsh, to keep hold of the ball, while Owen bent down <b>and</b> <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> collect it. Oughtred came around the scrum to tackle Owen and finding the Welshman empty handed was penalised for being off-side. John Strand-Jones kicked the penalty, allowing Wales to win 9-8.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the family}} was happy in Lorch, Schiller's father found his work unsatisfying. He {{sometimes}} took his son with him. In Lorch, Schiller received his primary education. The quality of the lessons was fairly bad, and Friedrich regularly cut class with his older sister. Because his parents wanted Schiller to become a pastor, they had the pastor of the village instruct the boy in Latin and Greek. Pastor Moser was a good teacher, and later Schiller named the cleric in his first play Die Räuber (The Robbers) after him. As a boy, Schiller was excited {{by the idea of}} becoming a cleric and often put on black robes <b>and</b> <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> preach.|$|E

25|$|On {{the same}} cliff path where Nofret and Satipy died, Renisenb, {{apparently}} summoned by Hori, hears footsteps {{behind her and}} turns to see Yahmose. She then sees the look of murderous hatred in her brother's eyes that the other women saw before they were killed. On the brink of her own death, she realises that Satipy was not looking in fear at anything beyond Yahmose — she was looking straight at him. He had consumed a non-lethal dose of poison <b>and</b> <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> recuperate while committing murders, both to make himself chief heir and to indulge his newfound love of violence. As Renisenb realises some of this, Hori slays Yahmose with an arrow and saves her. Hori explains all. Renisenb's final choice is whom to marry: Kameni, a lively husband not unlike her first, or Hori, an older and more enigmatic figure. She makes her choice and falls into Hori’s arms.|$|E
25|$|When Emperor Ling became {{critically}} ill in 189, he secretly entrusted an eight-year-old Liu Xie {{to a close}} aide and eunuch, Jian Shuo. Upon Emperor Ling's death, Jian Shuo attempted to lure He Jin into a trap in the palace, assassinate him, and then install Liu Xie on the throne. However, Pan Yin (潘隱), a eunuch who was also an acquaintance of He Jin, warned the General-in-Chief of Jian Shuo's plot. He Jin returned to his military camp <b>and</b> <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> be sick so {{he did not need}} to respond when summoned to enter the palace. Jian Shuo's plan to make Liu Xie emperor failed, so a 13-year-old Liu Bian was enthroned and became historically known as Emperor Shao. Empress He, as the emperor's mother, became empress dowager and attended imperial court sessions alongside her son. As Emperor Shao was still young, General-in-Chief He Jin and Grand Tutor Yuan Wei (袁隗) served as his regents.|$|E
25|$|In early April 1288 {{the naval}} fleet, led by Omar and escorted by infantry, fled home along the Bạch Đằng river. As bridges and roads were {{destroyed}} and attacks were launched by Đại Việt troops, the Mongols reached Bạch Đằng without an infantry escort. Đại Việt's small flotilla engaged in battle <b>and</b> <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> retreat. The Mongols eagerly pursued the Đại Việt troops only {{to fall into}} their pre-arranged battlefield. Thousands of small Đại Việt boats quickly appeared from both banks, launched a fierce attack that broke the Mongols' combat formation. The Mongols, meeting such a sudden and strong attack, in panic tried to withdraw to the sea. The Mongols' boats were halted, and many were damaged and sank. At that time, a number of fire rafts quickly rushed toward the Mongols, who were frightened and jumped down to reach the banks where they were dealt a heavy blow by an army led by the Trần king and Trần Hưng Đạo.|$|E

25|$|Rabbinic {{literature}} also records {{a tradition}} of eating cheese and other dairy products during Hanukkah. This custom, as mentioned above, commemorates the heroism of Judith during the Babylonian captivity of the Jews and reminds us that women also {{played an important role}} in the events of Hanukkah. The deuterocanonical book of Judith (Yehudit or Yehudis in Hebrew), which is not part of the Tanakh, records that Holofernes, an Assyrian general, had surrounded the village of Bethulia as part of his campaign to conquer Judea. After intense fighting, the water supply of the Jews was cut off and the situation became desperate. Judith, a pious widow, told the city leaders that she had a plan to save the city. Judith went to the Assyrian camps <b>and</b> <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> surrender. She met Holofernes, who was smitten by her beauty. She went back to his tent with him, where she plied him with cheese and wine. When he fell into a drunken sleep, Judith beheaded him and escaped from the camp, taking the severed head with her (the beheading of Holofernes by Judith has historically been a popular theme in art). When Holofernes' soldiers found his corpse, they were overcome with fear; the Jews, on the other hand, were emboldened and launched a successful counterattack. The town was saved, and the Assyrians defeated.|$|E

Some reports from {{witnesses}} said Clemmons parked his truck in a car wash north of the coffee shop <b>and</b> <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> clean the vehicle, but never turned the hose on. Around 8 a.m, Clemmons walked into the Forza Coffee Co. coffee shop, where four police officers were working on laptops before their shift. Clemmons opened fire on the officers, shooting them to death.|$|E

[...] Family members said Gardner attended Otterstrom's funeral <b>and</b> <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> be a childhood friend. Following a tip, police apprehended Gardner three weeks later at the home of his cousin. Gardner said that the shooting occurred because Otterstrom put up a fight, but investigators did not find any evidence to support this claim. Gardner was held in custody in lieu of $1.5million bail. His getaway driver was identified as Darcy Perry McCoy, who testified against him.|$|E

His re-entry into public speaking followed the annual Harvard–Yale football game in 1914, where he presented a practical joke involving [...] "Professor Soong" [...] giving a question-and-answer session on football in Chinese.
