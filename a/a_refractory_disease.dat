We investigated the effect of refined deep-sea water (RDSW) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced inflammatory response in RAW 264. 7 macrophage cells. The results showed that RDSW suppressed the expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX) - 2. Furthermore, nitric oxide, a product of iNOS, and prostaglandin (PG) D 2 and PGE 2, products of COX- 2, were significantly inhibited by RDSW in a hardness-dependent manner. Moreover, we found that RDSW reversed the release of histamines and regressed the mRNA expressions and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL) - 1 β, IL- 6, and IL- 10, and vascular endothelial growth factor, in a hardness-dependent manner. We also found that the suppressive effect of RDSW on LPS-induced inflammatory responses was regulated by the inhibition of NF-κB nuclear translocation, and ERK 1 / 2 and JNK 1 / 2 mediated the suppression of c-Jun and c-Fos expressions.

Here, we report our experiences with 19 patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDC/ASCT) within the GELTAMO co-operative group between 1992 and 2004. METHODS: The median age at transplantation was 46 yr. Fifteen patients underwent the procedure as front-line therapy and four patients as salvage therapy. Most patients received peripheral stem cells (90 %) coupled with BEAM or BEAC as conditioning regimen (79 %). RESULTS: A 79 % of patients achieved complete response, 5 % partial response and 16 % failed the procedure. After a median follow-up of 25 months, eight patients died (seven of progressive disease and secondary neoplasia), while actuarial overall survival and progression-free survival at 3 yr was 60 % and 55 %. Prognostic factors associated with a poor outcome included bone marrow involvement, transplantation in refractory disease state, attributing more than one factor of the age-adjusted-International Prognostic Index, Pretransplant peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) Score or Prognostic Index for PTCL. CONCLUSIONS: More {{than half of the}} patients with AIL that display unfavourable prognostic factors at diagnosis or relapse would be expected to be alive and disease-free after 3 yr when treated with HDC/ASCT.

40|$|AbstractPatients with chemorefractory mantle cell {{lymphoma}} (MCL) have a poor prognosis. We {{used the}} Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research database {{to study the}} outcome of 202 patients with refractory MCL who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) using either myeloablative (MA) or reduced-intensity/nonmyeloablative conditioning (RIC/NST), during 1998 - 2010. We analyzed nonrelapse mortality (NRM), progression/relapse, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Seventy-four patients (median age, 54 years) received MA, and 128 patients (median age, 59 years) received RIC/NST. Median follow-up after allo-HCT was 35 months in the MA group and 43 months in the RIC/NST group. At 3 years post-transplantation, no significant between-group differences were seen in terms of NRM (47 % in MA versus 43 % in RIC/NST; P =. 68), relapse/progression (33 % versus 32 %; P =. 89), PFS (20 % versus 25 %; P =. 53), or OS (25 % versus 30 %; P =. 45). Multivariate analysis also revealed no significant between-group differences in NRM, relapse, PFS, or OS; however, receipt of a bone marrow or T cell–depleted allograft was {{associated with an increased}} risk of NRM and inferior PFS and OS.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the long-term response to rituximab in patients with chronic and refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Adults with ITP fail to respond to conventional therapies in almost 30 % of cases, developing <b>a</b> <b>refractory</b> <b>disease.</b> Rituximab has been successfully used in these patients. We used rituximab at 375  mg/m 2, IV, weekly for a total of four doses in 18 adult patients. Complete remission (CR) was considered if the platelet count was > 100 [*]×[*] 109 /l, partial remission (PR) if platelets were > 50 [*]×[*] 109 /l, minimal response (MR) if the platelet count was > 30 [*]×[*] 109 /l and < 50 [*]×[*] 109 /l, and no response if platelet count remained unchanged. Response was classified as sustained (SR) when it was stable for a minimum of 6  months. Median age was 43. 5  years (range, 17 to 70). Median platelet count at baseline was 12. 5 [*]×[*] 109 /l (range, 3. 0 to 26. 3). CR was achieved in five patients (28 %), PR in five (28 %), MR in four (22 %), and two patients were classified as therapeutic failures (11 %). Two additional patients were lost to follow-up. The median time between rituximab therapy and response was 14  weeks (range, 4 to 32). SR was achieved in 12 patients (67 %). There were no severe adverse events during rituximab therapy. During follow-up (median, 26  months; range, 12 to 59), no other immunosuppressive drugs were used. In conclusion, rituximab therapy is effective and safe in adult patients with chronic and refractory ITP. Overall response rate achieved is high, long term, and with no risk of adverse events...|$|E

40|$|Alveolar {{echinococcosis}} is <b>a</b> <b>refractory</b> <b>disease</b> {{caused by}} the metacestode stage of Echinococcus multilocularis. The life cycle of this parasite is maintained primarily between foxes and many species of rodents; thus, dogs {{are thought to be}} a minor definitive host except in some endemic areas. However, dogs are highly susceptible to E. multilocularis infection. Because of the close contact between dogs and humans, infection of dogs with this parasite can be an important risk to human health. Therefore, new measures and tools to control and prevent parasite transmission required. Using 2 -dimensional electrophoresis followed by western blot (2 D-WB) analysis, a large glycoprotein component of protoscoleces was identified based on reactivity to intestinal IgA in dogs experimentally infected with E. multilocularis. This component, designated SRf 1, was purified by gel filtration using a Superose 6 column. Glycosylation analysis and immunostaining revealed that SRf 1 could be distinguished from Em 2, a major mucin-type antigen of E. multilocularis. Dogs (n= 6) were immunized intranasally with 500 µg of SRf 1 with cholera toxin subunit B by using a spray syringe, and a booster was given orally using an enteric capsule containing 15 mg of the same antigen. As a result, dogs immunized with this antigen showed an 87. 6 % reduction in worm numbers compared to control dogs (n= 5) who received only PBS administration. A weak serum antibody response was observed in SRf 1 -immunized dogs, but there was no correlation between antibody response and worm number. We demonstrated {{for the first time that}} mucosal immunization using SRf 1, a glycoprotein component newly isolated from E. multilocularis protoscoleces, induced a protection response to E. multilocularis infection in dogs. Thus, our data indicated that mucosal immunization using surface antigens will be an important tool to facilitate the development of practical vaccines for definitive hosts...|$|E

The finding of two 6 and 18 bp insertions in the promoter region of the MCL- 1 gene in 17 of 58 CLL-patients provides a possible explanation for different expression of this gene, because of their absence {{in the control group}} (n= 18) and in non leukaemic cells of two patients a somatic origin was suggested. The presence of these insertions was associated with high mRNA and protein expression as well as with nonresponsiveness to therapy and outcome. In this work the relevance of these insertions for relapse of childhood ALL was investigated, which are {{the most common cause of}} treatment failure and often represent <b>a</b> <b>refractory</b> <b>disease.</b> The insertions were present at similar frequencies in the patient and the control group (27 / 134 [20. 2 %] and 20 / 98 [20. 4 %] respectively) as well as in corresponding remission material of the patients (identical genotype). Their presence was neither correlated with prognostic parameters at the time of relapse nor with event free survival of the patients, and analysis of gene expression does not reveal an influence by these insertions. These data strongly suggest that the insertions represent hereditary polymorphisms, which are unlikely to contribute to the process of relapse and do not seem to be of prognostic importance in childhood ALL at first relapse. But independently of the presence of these insertions there is a correlation between high MCL- 1 expression and the occurrence of a second relapse, a fact that emphasises the importance of MCL- 1 for resistance to therapy and demands further investigations...|$|E

MSCs {{are responsible for the}} normal turnover and maintenance of adult mesenchymal tissues as the result of their multipotent differentiation abilities and their secretion of a variety of cytokines and growth factors. Although initially derived from bone marrow, MSCs are present in many different tissues such as many peri-articular tissues. MSCs may exert immune-modulatory properties, modulating different immune cells in both in vitro and in vivo models, and they are considered immune-privileged cells. At present, these capacities are considered the most intriguing aspect of their biology, introducing the possibility that these cells may be used as effective therapy in autoimmune diseases. Therefore, stem cell therapies may represent an innovative approach for the treatment of rheumatic diseases, especially for the forms that are not responsive to standard treatments or alternatively still lacking a definite therapy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Primary <b>refractory</b> <b>disease</b> is <b>a</b> main {{challenge}} {{in the management of}} non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). This survey was performed to define the rate of <b>refractory</b> <b>disease</b> to first-line therapy in B and T-cell NHL subtypes and the long-term survival of primary refractory compared to primary responsive patients. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed of 3, 106 patients who had undergone primary treatment for NHL between 1982 and 2012, at the Hematology Centers of Torino and Bergamo, Italy. Primary treatment included CHOP or CHOP-like regimens (63. 2 %), intensive therapy with autograft (16. 9 %), or other therapies (19. 9 %). Among B-cell NHL, 1, 356 (47. 8 %) received first-line chemotherapy with rituximab. <b>Refractory</b> <b>disease</b> was defined as stable/progressive disease, or transient response with disease progression within six months. RESULTS: Overall, 690 (22. 2 %) patients showed primary <b>refractory</b> <b>disease,</b> with <b>a</b> higher incidence amongst T-cell compared to B-cell NHL (41. 9 % vs. 20. 5 %, respectively, p< 0. 001). Several other clinico-pathological factors at presentation were variably associated with <b>refractory</b> <b>disease,</b> including histological aggressive disease, unfavorable clinical presentation, Bone Marrow involvement, low lymphocyte/monocyte ration and male gender. Amongst B-cell NHL, the addition of rituximab was associated with a marked reduction of <b>refractory</b> <b>disease</b> (13. 6 % vs. 26. 7 % for non-supplemented chemotherapy, p< 0. 001). Overall, primary responsive patients had a median survival of 19. 8 years, compared to 1. 3 yr. for <b>refractory</b> patients. <b>A</b> prolonged survival was consistently observed in all primary responsive patients regardless of the histology. The long life expectancy of primary responsive patients was documented in both series managed before and after 2. 000. Response to first line therapy resulted by far the most predictive factor for long-term outcome (HR for primary refractory disease: 16. 52, p< 0. 001). CONCLUSION: Chemosensitivity to primary treatment is crucial for the long-term survival in NHL. This supports the necessity of studies aimed to early identify <b>refractory</b> <b>disease</b> and to develop different treatment strategies for responsive and refractory patients...|$|R

Two drugs, infliximab first, then adalimumab afterward, showed effectiveness in inducing and maintaining long-term remission both in pivotal trials as well as in clinical practice. However, approximately 25 % of patients with UC, who fail or do not tolerate all available therapies, require <b>a</b> colectomy for <b>refractory</b> <b>disease.</b> The therapeutic scenario of UC has been recently upgraded by the introduction of golimumab, the latest anti TNF-alpha agent to be approved. Golimumab is a totally humanized monoclonal antibody, administered by a subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks. Treatment with golimumab has shown to be effective to induce sustained clinical benefit in tough-to-treat patients with UC, including steroid and/or immunosuppressive refractory and steroid-dependent patients. In this review, we summarize all available efficacy and safety data of golimumab in UC, analyzing the potential therapeutic position for the treatment of refractory patients with UC. Keywords: ulcerative colitis, refractoriness, anti-TNF-alpha, golimumab ...|$|R

40|$|Diffuse large B cell {{lymphoma}} (DLBCL) is {{the most}} common subtype of B cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), encompassing 30 – 40 % of the estimated 70, 000 cases of NHL in 2014 in the USA. Despite major improvements with immune-chemotherapy, the fraction of patients who still succumb to <b>a</b> <b>refractory</b> or relapsed <b>disease</b> remains high. This review addresses whether the better understanding of the biology of DLBCL defines new therapeutic avenues that may overcome the emerging resistance of this disease to traditional immune-chemotherapy, such as rituximab in combination with traditional chemotherapy agents. Emerging targeted therapy for relapsed refractory DLBCL encompasses more complex molecular abnormalities involving signaling pathways other than NF-κB as mechanism of resistance to immune-chemotherapy. Our review suggests that NF-κB pathway is an important crossroad where other pathways converge as phenotype of resistance that emerges in patients who fail frontline and salvage immune-chemotherapy. Future efforts should aim at targeting the role of NF-κB resistance in clinical trials, where novel agents like lenalidomide and proteasome inhibitors with established activity in this perspective will be an important component in combination therapy, along with new monoclonal antibody, BTK-inhibitors, and other novel therapy agents...|$|R
40|$|<b>A</b> <b>refractory</b> and {{resistant}} <b>disease</b> {{to conventional}} induction chemotherapy and relapsed disease are considered {{as the most}} important adverse prognostic factors for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Sixty-one patients (median age, 33. 6 yr) with relapsed or refractory AML were treated with the FLAG regimen that consisted of fludarabine (30 mg/m 2, days 1 - 5), cytarabine (2. 0 g/m 2, days 1 - 5) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Of the treated patients 29 patients (47. 5 %) achieved complete remission (CR). Higher CR rates were observed for patients with a first or second relapse as compared to patients with <b>a</b> primary <b>refractory</b> response or relapse after stem cell transplantation (HSCT). There was {{a significant difference in the}} response rates according to the duration of leukemia-free survival (pre-LFS) before chemotherapy (P= 0. 05). The recovery time of both neutrophils (≥ 500 /µL) and platelets (≥ 20, 000 /µL) required a median of 21 and 18 days, respectively. Treatment-related mortality (TRM) occurred in seven patients (11. 4 %), of which 71. 4 % of TRM was caused by an invasive aspergillosis infection. After achieving CR, 18 patients underwent consolidation chemotherapy and six patients underwent allogeneic HSCT. In conclusion, FLAG chemotherapy without idarubicin is a relatively effective and well-tolerated regimen for relapsed or refractory AML and the use of FLAG chemotherapy has allowed intensive post-remission therapy including HSCT...|$|R
