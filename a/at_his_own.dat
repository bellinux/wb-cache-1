5|$|After Tatum {{resigned}} to coach <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> alma mater, North Carolina, Tommy Mont was appointed as his replacement. In his first season, Maryland was riddled with injuries and posted a disappointing 2–7–1 record.

Breedlove later went on to play {{eight years in the}} NFL and made a Pro Bowl appearance.|$|E

5|$|Calvin's first {{published}} work was a commentary of Seneca the Younger's De Clementia. Published <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> expense in 1532, {{it showed that}} he was a humanist in the tradition of Erasmus with a thorough understanding of classical scholarship. His first theological work, the Psychopannychia, attempted to refute the doctrine of soul sleep as promulgated by the Anabaptists. Calvin probably wrote it during the period following Cop's speech, but it was not published until 1542 in Strasbourg.|$|E

5|$|Morris had {{continued}} to devote much time to writing poetry. In 1867 Bell and Dandy published Morris's epic poem, The Life and Death of Jason, <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> expense. The book was a retelling of the ancient Greek myth of the hero Jason and his quest to find the Golden Fleece. In contrast to Morris's former publication, The Life and Death of Jason was well received, resulting in the publishers paying Morris a fee for the second edition.|$|E

5|$|According to {{writer and}} film {{director}} Jukka Virtanen, Vainio usually wrote his lyrics {{at the same}} time as the music. This is evident in the song Vanhojapoikia viiksekkäitä, written as a waltz and whose lyrics feature an aged bachelor who never got to dance <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> wedding. Virtanen has said that while Vainio worked at a fast pace, songs were never easy for him to write. His work did not become easier when he quit drinking, but it did become more emotional.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Agrippa in 12BC, a {{solution}} had {{to be found in}} maintaining Rome's water supply system. This came about because it was overseen by Agrippa when he served as aedile, and was even funded by him afterwards when he was a private citizen paying <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> expense. In that year, Augustus arranged a system where the Senate designated three of its members as prime commissioners in charge of the water supply and to ensure that Rome's aqueducts did not fall into disrepair.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Grinsell became a Pilot Officer in the Air Photographic Branch of the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1941. During he conflict, he was stationed in Egypt, where he spent time studying the archaeological remains of Ancient Egypt and visiting all of the pyramids near to Cairo. Based on these experiences, <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> expense he published Egyptian Pyramids in 1947. Designed as a guide to the sites, it was (as Grinsell acknowledged) heavily reliant on the earlier plans of Egyptologists but with additional aerial photographs that Grinsell had obtained through his involvement with the RAF. The book was largely ignored by Britain's Egyptological establishment.|$|E

5|$|As {{successful}} as Kansas' offense was, {{it was the}} Jayhawks' special teams (beating Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> game) that earned them the victory. Kansas blocked one Virginia Tech field goal, and caused Tech kicker Jud Dunlevy to miss another short. Kansas punter Kyle Tucker {{did an excellent job}} pinning Virginia Tech deep in its own end of the field, kicking the ball five times for a total of 250yards, averaging 50yards a punt. His longest punt, a 62-yard kick, was one of three punts that were downed inside Tech's 20-yard line.|$|E

He was survived by his wife and two sons, and cremated in a private ceremony.|$|E

Not risked in their first match in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, against Internazionale on a hard pitch in the San Siro, he played in their next, a 1–0 win against a Zagreb Select XI in Yugoslavia. Following a {{favourable}} specialist's report during the close season, Boyd took part in pre-season training, but his back still troubled him. On 17 August 1956, the day before Birmingham were to open their 1956–57 League campaign, Boyd's contract with the club was terminated <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> request.|$|E

5|$|Conwy Castle {{fell into}} {{disrepair}} {{again by the}} early 17th century. Charles I sold it to Edward Conway in 1627 for £100, and Edward's son, also called Edward, inherited the ruin in 1631. In 1642 the English Civil War broke out between the Charles' royalist supporters and Parliament. John Williams, the Archbishop of York, {{took charge of the}} castle on behalf of the king, and set about repairing and garrisoning it <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> expense. In 1645, Sir John Owen was appointed governor of the castle instead, however, leading to a bitter dispute between the two men. The Archbishop defected to Parliament, the town of Conwy fell in August 1646 and in November General Thomas Mytton finally took the castle itself after a substantial siege.|$|E
