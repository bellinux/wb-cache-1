5|$|Jackson quickly built <b>a</b> <b>track</b> <b>record</b> {{of never}} missing a floor vote. Once he nearly missed his great-grandmother's funeral for a roll call, but the {{presiding}} officer {{was able to}} slightly delay the closing the roll, thereby keeping his attendance record. Fellow Democrats said he debates and votes with a contentiousness {{that makes it difficult}} to view him as a team player. Jackson developed foes not only in the House, but also in Chicago against William Daley, who had a hand in several attempts to block Jackson's seating on the transportation committee he desired because of his support for a third Chicago airport. Jackson has also been a target of conservative media figures. Jackson established a heavily liberal voting record on both social and fiscal issues. During the 1990s, because of his name recognition and liberal track record, Jackson received many public speaking and media requests.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Rosecroft's history, it has {{featured}} notable races. From 1984 to 1988, it hosted {{segments of}} the Breeders Crown. Starting in 1990 and ending in 1995, the racetrack hosted the Messenger Stakes, the second leg of the Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers. Rosecroft hosted the Potomac Stakes, Maryland most successful harness race, from 1990 to 1992. Rosecroft features the Maryland Sire Stakes, which showcases the best standardbred horses in Maryland. Besides the races, Rosecroft has had famous people and horses work and race at the track. John Wager, Maryland's all-time most winning driver, has been working at Rosecroft since 1974. Several famous people—Lyndon B. Johnson, Elizabeth Taylor, and Nancy Pelosi, among others—have visited Rosecroft. Cam's Card Shark raced at Rosecroft in 1994 and challenged the single-season record for most money won in a season by winning over $2 million, and Robust Hanover set <b>a</b> <b>track</b> <b>record</b> while winning the Breeders Crown in 1985.|$|E
5|$|On 30 August 2011, CERA added Radio Network House to {{the list}} of {{buildings}} to be demolished. On 17 July 2012, the local Canterbury newspaper The Press reported that implosion of Radio Network House had been approved by CERA. The same day, a press conference was held, where representatives of the demolition companies involved and of CERA addressed the media. The main contractor for the demolition was Naylor Love, who engaged Ceres New Zealand for the implosion. Ceres in turn partnered with Controlled Demolition, Inc., an American company based in Phoenix, Maryland, that has <b>a</b> <b>track</b> <b>record</b> of 9,000 implosions and is considered a world leader in the field. The implosion of Radio Network House was a test case, as the technique had not been applied in New Zealand before, and there are still many more tall buildings to be demolished in Christchurch. The implosion was challenging for Controlled Demolition, Inc., as New Zealand buildings are designed to withstand earthquake loading and thus have much more reinforcing in them than the buildings they usually deal with.|$|E

25|$|Price ran Carry Back twenty-one {{times as}} a two-year-old juvenile, {{beginning}} in Florida in January, winning five times, with four seconds and four thirds. Even for the time, that was an exceptionally taxing campaign for an immature colt. In his first sixteen starts, Carry Back won two minor races, attracting some press attention when setting <b>a</b> <b>track</b> <b>record</b> for five furlongs at Gulfstream Park in April. He finished third to Hail to Reason in the Sapling Stakes at Oceanport in August and second by a nose to the same colt in the World's Playground Stakes at Atlantic City in September.|$|E
25|$|South Africa {{also has}} a strong water {{industry}} with <b>a</b> <b>track</b> <b>record</b> in innovation. However, much less progress has been achieved on sanitation: Access increased only from 71% to 79% during the same period. Significant problems remain concerning the financial sustainability of service providers, leading {{to a lack of}} attention to maintenance. The uncertainty about the government's ability to sustain funding levels in the sector is also a concern. Two distinctive features of the South African water sector are the policy of free basic water and the existence of water boards, which are bulk water supply agencies that operate pipelines and sell water from reservoirs to municipalities.|$|E

25|$|Wilberforce had <b>a</b> <b>track</b> <b>record</b> against {{evolution}} {{as far back}} as the previous Oxford B.A. meeting in 1847 when he attacked Chambers' Vestiges. For the more challenging task of opposing the Origin, and the implication that man descended from apes, he had been assiduously coached by Richard Owen– Owen stayed with him the night before the debate. On the day Wilberforce repeated some of the arguments from his Quarterly Review article (written but not yet published), then ventured onto slippery ground. His famous jibe at Huxley (as to whether Huxley was descended from an ape on his mother's side or his father's side) was probably unplanned, and certainly unwise. Huxley's reply to the effect that he would rather be descended from an ape than a man who misused his great talents to suppress debate—the exact wording is not certain—was widely recounted in pamphlets and a spoof play.|$|E

With the launch of Société Générale AM UK in London and the acquisition of Yamaichi in Japan, Société Générale Asset Management has taken a decisive step in establishing its international presence and is now able to offer its customers truly global fund management capabilities. Société Générale also has a worldwide presence in private banking activities. After pursuing a deliberate policy of acquisitions in 1998, Société Générale Private Banking consolidated and developed its franchise in 1999 {{against a backdrop of}} tougher competition.|$|E

Eurogamer wrote that the Twitter account continued the tradition of previous Molyneux spoofs, such as a quest in Fable 2 that imitated an idiosyncratic tree-growing mechanic from its predecessor.
