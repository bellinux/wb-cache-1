The cast of the Radio Drama Company changes <b>around</b> <b>every</b> six months, which means that cast of Planet B changes every series.|$|E
5|$|Herne Bay {{railway station}} {{is on the}} Chatham Main Line, which runs between Ramsgate in East Kent and London Victoria. Other {{stations}} on this line include Broadstairs, Margate, Whitstable, Faversham, Gillingham, Rochester and Bromley South. Herne Bay is around 1hour and 40minutes from London. A National Express coach service also runs between London Victoria and Ramsgate, <b>around</b> <b>every</b> {{two to three hours}} during daytime. A selection of trains run to London's Cannon Street station, primarily for business commuting.|$|E
5|$|Honoré de Balzac {{was profoundly}} {{influenced}} by Scott (as well as Irish writer Maria Edgeworth), {{and decided to}} write novels using France's turbulent history as a literary backdrop {{in the same way}} they had used the history of Scotland and Ireland. Balzac had previously only published potboiler novels under a variety of pseudonyms, books designed to excite readers and sell copies. He had also engaged in a series of ill-fated speculative investments, which left him in considerable debt. Nevertheless, he believed in his skills as a writer, and awaited success <b>around</b> <b>every</b> corner.|$|E

5|$|The censor was {{appointed}} specifically {{to conduct the}} census. This involved counting the Roman people, assessing their property, and assigning them to their appropriate centuria and tribus. They were elected <b>around</b> <b>every</b> four or five years. After the passage of lex Ovinia, the censors were also transferred the power from the consuls to control membership in the Senate. Along with the main responsibility {{of dealing with the}} census, the censors also dealt with property disputes, public contracts, and the management of public lands.|$|E
5|$|The Halifaxes and Horsas {{were moved}} to RAF Portreath in Cornwall, to shorten the {{distance}} {{they would have to}} travel. Even so, they were left with a ten-hour flight to Sale airport in Morocco. On arrival at Sale the gliders were released to land on a sand-patch alongside the runway. Once on the ground each Horsa was fitted with the spare landing gear it carried inside, and the flight immediately took off again on the next leg of the journey, to Mascara in Algeria. Their journey did not end here; they left for the final destination, Kairouan Airfield in Tunisia, as soon as possible. During the flight the gliders were provided with three pilots, who had to change <b>around</b> <b>every</b> hour to relieve fatigue.|$|E

25|$|Bismarck {{spent his}} final years {{composing}} his memoirs (Gedanken und Erinnerungen, or Thoughts and Memories), a work lauded by historians.

He also published {{the text of the}} Reinsurance Treaty with Russia, a major breach of national security, for which an individual of lesser status would have been heavily prosecuted.|$|E

25|$|During this age, the {{production}} of ceramic pieces was abundant. Amphorae were produced in mass quantity due to the heavy trading with other cities all around the Mediterranean. Large evidence of amphorae from this era can be found <b>around</b> <b>every</b> major ancient port {{as well as in}} the Aegean sea. During this period is also seen an abundance of white background ceramics which are much more delicate than the previously popular yellow and black background ceramics. These ceramics were often used to keep perfume or for mortuary rites, including decorations on graves.|$|E
25|$|The tesseract can be {{constructed}} {{in a number of}} ways. As a regular polytope with three cubes folded together <b>around</b> <b>every</b> edge, it has Schläfli symbol {4,3,3} with hyperoctahedral symmetry of order 384. Constructed as a 4D hyperprism made of two parallel cubes, it can be named as a composite Schläfli symbol {4,3}×{}, with symmetry order 96. As a 4-4 duoprism, a Cartesian product of two squares, it can be named by a composite Schläfli symbol {4}×{4}, with symmetry order 64. As an orthotope it can be represented by composite Schläfli symbol {}×{}×{}×{} or {}4, with symmetry order 16.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} myths {{regarding the}} origin of the games are recounted by the Greek historian, Pausanias. According to the story, the dactyl Heracles (not {{to be confused with the}} son of Zeus and the Roman god Hercules) and four of his brothers, Paeonaeus, Epimedes, Iasius and Idas, raced at Olympia to entertain the newborn Zeus. He crowned the victor with an olive tree wreath (which thus became a peace symbol), which also explains the four year interval, bringing the games <b>around</b> <b>every</b> fifth year (counting inclusively). The other Olympian gods (so named because they lived permanently on Mount Olympus) would also engage in wrestling, jumping and running contests.|$|E

25|$|Mice have a rapid {{reproduction}} rate; the {{gestation period}} is approximately 19 to 23 days. The typical litter size is 4 to 12 young. In some instances, up to thirty young have been born. Males can mate {{with the female}} {{as soon as the}} litter is born, which means that a female could become pregnant with another litter within 3 days of giving birth. Female mice should not be bred before 12 weeks or after 8 months; doing so can be very dangerous, and some mice can die while giving birth. Females come into heat <b>around</b> <b>every</b> three to five days, so the pair can be kept together for up to ten days.|$|E
25|$|Water, however, is not {{a finite}} {{resource}} (meaning the availability of water is limited), but rather re-circulated as potable water in precipitation in quantities many orders of magnitude higher than human consumption. Therefore, it is the relatively small quantity of water in reserve in the earth (about 1% of our drinking water supply, which is replenished in aquifers <b>around</b> <b>every</b> 1 to 10 years), that is a non-renewable resource, and it is, rather, the distribution of potable and irrigation water which is scarce, rather than the actual amount of it that exists on the earth. Water-poor countries use importation of goods as the primary method of importing water (to leave enough for local human consumption), since the manufacturing process uses around 10 to 100 times products' masses in water.|$|E
25|$|The {{converse}} question, {{whether the}} almost complex structure implies {{the existence of}} a complex structure is much less trivial, and not true in general. On an arbitrary almost complex manifold one can always find coordinates for which the almost complex structure takes the above canonical form at any given point p. In general, however, {{it is not possible to}} find coordinates so that J takes the canonical form on an entire neighborhood of p. Such coordinates, if they exist, are called 'local holomorphic coordinates for J'. If M admits local holomorphic coordinates for J <b>around</b> <b>every</b> point then these patch together to form a holomorphic atlas for M giving it a complex structure, which moreover induces J. J is then said to be 'integrable'. If J is induced by a complex structure, then it is induced by a unique complex structure.|$|E
