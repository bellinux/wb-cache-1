50|$|True leeches are {{subdivided}} into two groups, the <b>Arhynchobdellida</b> or Arhynchobdellae (proboscisless leeches), and the Rhynchobdellida or Rhynchobdellae (jawless leeches). Note {{that the lack}} of jaws is a plesiomorphy, while the presence of a proboscis is an apomorphy - not all <b>Arhynchobdellida</b> have jaws, but all Rhynchobdellida have a proboscis. The most well-known leech species, Hirudo medicinalis (European Medical Leech), belongs to the <b>Arhynchobdellida.</b>|$|E
50|$|Compared {{to their}} sister taxon, the <b>Arhynchobdellida</b> (proboscisless leeches), rhynchobdellid {{systematics}} {{has always been}} rather straightforward as regards the main clades contained therein. The common name is actually misleading however, as jawlessness is a primitive trait among leeches in general - most <b>Arhynchobdellida</b> are in fact jawless too. It is rather the proboscis that is the characteristic apomorphy of the Rhynchobdellida.|$|E
5000|$|The Erpobdelliformes {{are one of}} the currently-accepted suborders of the proboscisless leeches (<b>Arhynchobdellida).</b> It {{includes}} four families: ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Arhynchobdellida</b> lack a {{proboscis}} and {{may or may}} {{not have}} jaws armed with teeth. Arhynchobellids are divided into two orders: ...|$|E
50|$|Erpobdellidae is {{a family}} of leeches. It {{is one of the}} four {{families}} belonging to the suborder Erpobdelliformes of the proboscisless leeches order, <b>Arhynchobdellida.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The more {{primitive}} Acanthobdellidea are often {{included with the}} leeches, but some authors treat them as a separate clitellate group. True leeches of the infraclass Euhirudinea have both anterior and posterior suckers. They are divided into two groups: <b>Arhynchobdellida</b> and Rhynchobdellida ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>Arhynchobdellida</b> were {{formerly}} {{divided into}} two groups, denoted by {{presence or absence of}} toothed jaws. But this does not represent a natural division, as has now been determined - the most primitive proboscisless leeches are not found among the jawed blood-sucking forms as was generally believed, but among the jawless predators.|$|E
5000|$|The Hirudiniformes {{are one of}} the currently-accepted suborders of the proboscisless leeches (<b>Arhynchobdellida).</b> Their most {{well-known}} member is the European medical leech, Hirudo medicinalis, and indeed most of the blood-sucking [...] "worms" [...] as which leeches are generally perceived belong to this group. In general, though some leeches suck blood, many are predators which hunt small invertebrates.|$|E
5000|$|Philippi, who {{originally}} classified A. valdiviana as an erpobdellid leech, noted that Americobdella valdiviana {{was similar to}} Trocheta (now synonymized with Erpobdella) [...] "in both appearance and habit". It is phylogenically between two major groups of leeches, the Rhynchobdellida and the <b>Arhynchobdellida.</b> Recent work has suggested A. valdiviana is {{more closely related to}} the Erpobdelliformes than the Hirudiniformes.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the two orders accepted today, {{there is a more}} basal lineage. These, the Americobdellidae, are not assigned order rank but treated as a family to signify their phylogenetic position near the base of the <b>Arhynchobdellida.</b> They are massive annelids, measuring 30 cm long in some cases, and are anatomically primitive. These animals hunt earthworms, which they suck in one piece through their toothless mouth.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Arhynchobdellida</b> {{systematics}} {{has been}} revised in modern times. Formerly {{it was believed}} that they can be divided into a jawed and a jawless order. However, the lack of jaws does not denote a particularly close relationship. Jawed leeches are more numerous but exclusively found among the Hirudiniformes, while the jawless [...] "Pharyngobdellida" [...] (or [...] "Pharyngobdellae"), also known as [...] "worm-leeches", are more diverse and occur in the Hirudiniformes and the Erpobdelliformes alike.|$|E
5000|$|The proboscisless leeches, <b>Arhynchobdellida,</b> are {{classified}} as an order of the Hirudinea. But leech taxonomy and systematics will eventually be revised in due time, not {{because there are many}} uncertainties about their phylogeny, but because the major clades of clitellate annelids - and whether the clitellates are themselves a clade - have not been fully elucidated. For example, the [...] "true leeches" [...] (Euhirudinea) might actually be synonymous with the Hirudinea, as all other leech-like annelids might not be very closely related to the true leeches.|$|E
50|$|Terrestrial leeches {{primarily}} feed on mammals, {{though the}} New Zealand species {{have adapted to}} rely on birds. The Open Bay Islands leech feeds primarily on the feet of nesting seabirds, especially Fiordland penguins (Eudyptes pachyrhynchus). Leeches are able to ingest several times their body weight in blood, and can take months to digest it. Outside of the breeding season, H. antipodum may feed opportunistically on other vertebrates, such as fur seals, or even earthworms. New Zealand terrestrial leeches may have once been opportunistic feeders of even active forest birds, such as the extinct moa.Leeches are hermaphrodites, with {{both male and female}} genital pores. Those in the order <b>Arhynchobdellida</b> lay 5-10 eggs in cocoons. When Cockayne and Dunlop discovered this species, their initial search located six more individuals and two empty cocoons, which were oval, 14 mm long, and dark brown with a horny texture.|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} leeches from Lake Gusinoe and its {{adjacent}} area offered us {{the possibility to}} determine species diversity. As a result, an updated species list of the Gusinoe Hirudinea fauna (Annelida, Clitellata) has been compiled. There are two orders and three families of leeches in the Gusinoe area: order Rhynchobdellida (families Glossiphoniidae and Piscicolidae) and order <b>Arhynchobdellida</b> (family Erpobdellidae). In total, 6 leech species belonging to 6 genera have been identified. Of these, 3 taxa belonging to the family Glossiphoniidae (Alboglossiphonia heteroclita f. papillosa, Hemiclepsis marginata, and Helobdella stagnalis) and representatives of 3 unidentified species (Glossiphonia sp., Piscicola sp., and Erpobdella sp.) have been recorded. The checklist gives a contemporary overview of the species composition of leeches and information on their hosts or substrates. The validity of morphological identification of each taxon has been verified by phylogenetic approach with a molecular marker adopted for a DNA barcoding of most invertebrates...|$|E

40|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{patterns of}} divergence of seven euhirudinean families were investigated by cladistic analysis of 33 euhirudinean species. Oligochaetes, Acanthobdella peledina, and branchiobdellidans were included as outgroup taxa. Cladistic analysis employed 1. 8 kb of nuclear 18 S ribosomal DNA and 651 bp of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I {{in addition to}} morphological data. The use of two molecular data sets, one nuclear gene and one mitochondrial gene, as well as morphological data combined historical information evolving {{under a variety of}} different constraints and therefore was less susceptible to the biases that could confound the use of only one type of data. Results suggest that the nuclear 18 S rDNA gene yields a meaningful historical signal for determining higher level relationships. The more rapidly evolving CO-I gene was informative for recent or local areas of the evolutionary hypothesis, such as within-family relationships. Analyses combining all data from the three character sets yielded one most-parsimonious tree. Most of the higher taxa in recent leech systematics were well corroborated in the resulting topology. However, these results suggested paraphyly of the order Rhynchobdellida, which contradicts the presence of a proboscis as a synapomorphy. The medicinal leech family Hirudinidae was polyphyletic because Haemadipsidae and Haemopidae each have a hirudinid ancestor. In addition, {{all but one of the}} genera within the family Erpobdellidae must be either abandoned or renamed. Unusual findings included compelling evidence of historical plasticity in bloodfeeding behavior, having been lost at least four times in the course of euhirudinean evolution.
