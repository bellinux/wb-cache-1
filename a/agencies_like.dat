At the time, the various online mapping services still did not show a complete freeway in eastern Ottawa or southern Kent counties. Services such as Mapquest and Yahoo! Maps rely on Tele Atlas out of New Hampshire for their mapping information, which, in turn, relies on <b>agencies</b> <b>like</b> MDOT to update their data. MDOT's map update came out nearly {{eight months after the}} initial opening due to its inclusion in a large-scale update to the state highway map.|$|E
5|$|When Bevin {{told the}} media {{he would have}} an {{announcement}} at his campaign headquarters on April 28, speculation raged that he would {{drop out of the}} race. Instead, Bevin announced that he would release his jobs plan later in the week and chided the local media for focusing on issues other than the economy. On May 1, Bevin released the promised jobs plan, which called for a gradual reduction of the federal corporate tax rate to 10% over five years, allowing companies to return overseas profits to the United States with a 10% tax assessment, and passage of a federal right-to-work law. Saying that burdensome regulations from <b>agencies</b> <b>like</b> the Environmental Protection Agency were harmful to business' ability to create jobs, he endorsed the REINS Act, which would require congressional approval of any executive regulation with an economic impact of more than $100 million. He also proposed a flat income tax and opposed an increase in the federal minimum wage.|$|E

However, after the October Revolution of 1917, it was replaced in Red Army field uniforms by the budenovka, {{and later by}} the garrison cap. The dress uniforms, on the other hand, retained this headgear, and various paramilitary Soviet <b>agencies</b> <b>like</b> the NKVD or VOKhR kept using it in all uniforms. <b>Agencies</b> <b>like</b> railway workers, firemen, pilots, mining supervisors, foresters, customs officers in the Soviet Union also were organised along military lines and wore uniforms with peaked caps of various designs.|$|E

Most of those soldiers had been captured by the Soviets during or in the aftermath of Operation Tempest, when many AK units tried to cooperate with the Red Army during their nationwide uprising against the Germans.|$|E
25|$|Bond {{prices can}} become {{volatile}} {{depending on the}} credit rating of the issuer – for instance if the credit rating <b>agencies</b> <b>like</b> Standard & Poor's and Moody's upgrade or downgrade the credit rating of the issuer. An unanticipated downgrade will cause the market price of the bond to fall. As with interest rate risk, this risk {{does not affect the}} bond's interest payments (provided the issuer does not actually default), but puts at risk the market price, which affects mutual funds holding these bonds, and holders of individual bonds who may have to sell them.|$|E

25|$|He {{obtained}} US {{citizenship in}} 1940, believing {{that as an}} American citizen, he would have greater opportunity to influence U.S. policies toward Italy. In fact, government <b>agencies</b> <b>like</b> the State Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), solicited his advice on Fascism and Italian matters in general. Notable writings of the American years include Under the Axe of Fascism (1936).

Among the informants were minor actresses like Francesca De Scaffa (ex-wife of Bruce Cabot) and Ronnie Quillan (ex-wife of screenwriter Joseph Quillan). According to Harrison, Barbara Payton would stop by Confidentials Hollywood office and sell a story whenever she was short of cash. However, the informants could {{rise to the}} level of prominent Hollywood columnists like Florabel Muir and in some cases, all the way up to a producer like Mike Todd or even a studio head like Harry Cohn. Money, publicity, revenge or blackmail was the lure.|$|E
25|$|Human Rights Cities {{have grown}} {{in part because of}} the {{enhanced}} efforts by international <b>agencies</b> <b>like</b> UN Habitat to connect international legal regimes with municipal programs. As a result of globalized economic development processes, cities around the world are facing a similar host of urban problems, including a lack of affordable housing, traffic congestion and insufficient public services. Cities have looked to international forums like the UN Conferences on Human Settlements and the World Associations of Cities and Local Authorities to help address these problems. Shulamith Koning, founder of the People’s Movement for Human Rights Learning (PDHRE), worked closely with human rights organizers in some of the first formally designated human rights cities, including Rosario Argentina, which became the first Human Rights City in the world in 1997 and the first U.S.-based Human Rights City of Washington, D.C.|$|E

5000|$|The {{decision}} {{to establish the}} UNEP as a program {{as opposed to a}} Specialized <b>Agency</b> <b>like</b> the WHO has had enormous implications for UNEP's performance. “In the UN hierarchy, Programmes have the least independence and authority,” and this has made it difficult for UNEP to establish authority over subsequent UN bodies dealing with the environment.
