5|$|After {{the flight}} test {{demonstration}} <b>and</b> <b>validation</b> of the prototypes, on 23 April 1991, Secretary of the USAF Donald Rice announced the YF-22 {{as the winner}} of the ATF competition. The YF-23 design was considered stealthier and faster, while the YF-22 was more maneuverable. The aviation press speculated that the YF-22 was also more adaptable to the U.S. Navy's Navalized Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF), but by 1992, the Navy had abandoned NATF.|$|E
5|$|Christian {{missions}} established Western {{educational institutions}} in the Protectorates. Under Britain's policy of indirect rule <b>and</b> <b>validation</b> of Islamic tradition, the Crown did not encourage the operation of Christian missions in the northern, Islamic part of the country. Some children of the southern elite went to Great Britain to pursue higher education. By independence in 1960, regional differences in modern educational access were marked. The legacy, though less pronounced, continues to the present day. Imbalances between North and South were expressed in Nigeria's political life as well. For instance, northern Nigeria did not outlaw slavery until 1936 whilst {{in other parts of}} Nigeria slavery was abolished soon after colonialism.|$|E
5|$|Indonesian {{independence}} was secured through {{a blend of}} both diplomacy and force. Despite their ill-discipline raising the prospect of anarchy, without youth confronting foreign and Indonesian colonial forces, Republican diplomatic efforts would have been futile. The revolution is the turning point of modern Indonesian history, and it has provided the reference point <b>and</b> <b>validation</b> for the country’s major political trends that continue to the present day. It gave impetus to communism in the country, to militant nationalism, to Sukarno's 'guided democracy', to political Islam, {{the origins of the}} Indonesian army and its role in Indonesian power, the country's constitutional arrangements, and the centralism of power in Indonesia.|$|E

40|$|The {{quantitative}} structure property relationship (QSPR) for gas/particle partition coefficient, Kp, of {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} (PCBs) was investigated. Molecular distance-edge vector (MDEV) index {{was used as}} the structural descriptor of PCBs. The quantitative relationship between the MDEV index and log Kp was modeled by multivariate linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) respectively. Leave one out cross <b>validation</b> <b>and</b> external <b>validation</b> were carried out to assess the prediction ability of the developed models. When the MLR method is used, the root mean square relative error (RMSRE) of prediction for leave one out cross <b>validation</b> <b>and</b> external <b>validation</b> is 4. 72 and 8. 62 respectively. When the ANN method is employed, the prediction RMSRE of leave one out cross <b>validation</b> <b>and</b> external <b>validation</b> is 3. 87 and 7. 47 respectively. It is demonstrated that the developed models are practicable for predicting the Kp of PCBs. The MDEV index is shown to be quantitatively related to the Kp of PCBs...|$|R
