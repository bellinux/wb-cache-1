5|$|As {{a part of}} Terengganu, Kuala Terengganu has a {{tropical}} rainforest climate under the Köppen climate classification (Af) with constant temperature and high humidity. The amount of rainfall varies according to the monsoon season. It is generally fairly hot and humid all year round, averaging from 28°C to 30°C in daytime and slightly cooler after dusk. Nevertheless, the sea breeze from South China Sea hsomehow moderates the humidity in offshore areas while the altitude <b>and</b> <b>lush</b> forest trees and plant has cooled the mountain and rural areas.|$|E
5|$|Modern cottage gardens include countless {{regional}} and personal variations and embrace plant materials, such as ornamental grasses or native plants {{not seen in}} the rural gardens of cottagers. Traditional roses, with their full fragrance <b>and</b> <b>lush</b> foliage, {{continue to be a}} cottage-garden mainstay — along with modern disease-resistant varieties that retain traditional attributes. Informal climbing plants, whether traditional or modern hybrids, are also common, as are the self-sowing annuals and freely spreading perennials favoured in traditional cottagers' gardens.|$|E

5000|$|The song [...] "Parallel Lines" [...] was {{originally}} written for Rundgren's musical theater Off Broadway production of Joe Orton's Up Against It.

5|$|The {{coastline}} is {{well known}} for its colourful flowers including sea aster, sea squill, sea thrift, common sea-lavender, bell and common heather. The Scottish primrose is found only on the coasts of Orkney and nearby Caithness and Sutherland. Although stands of trees are generally rare, a small forest named Happy Valley with 700 trees <b>and</b> <b>lush</b> gardens was created from a boggy hillside near Stenness {{during the second half of}} the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Dawn of Mana was designed, directed, and {{produced}} by series creator Koichi Ishii. The script {{was written by}} Ryo Akagi, based on a story created by Masato Kato, and the music was composed by a group led by Kenji Ito. The game was a moderate commercial success: it sold 229,000 copies in its first ten days of release in Japan, and over 410,000 copies worldwide {{by the end of}} 2008. While critics praised the graphics and music as beautiful <b>and</b> <b>lush,</b> they found the leveling system annoying, the combat controls difficult and frustrating, and the story trite.|$|E
5|$|Vegetation: Most of {{the spray}} zone {{adjacent}} to the Falls is covered with patches of various mosses, liverworts, and other low herbaceous vegetation, including Eutrochium purpureum, Angelica atropurpurea, and Aster spp. In addition, watercress Nasturtium officinale increased after the 1993 flood event. Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were found on vegetation up to 92cm above the ground and at 1/3 the maximum sunlight intensities of the sympatric Succinea sp. B. Vegetation is quite sparse {{on the west side}} of the Falls, and the only snails that have been observed there are Succinea sp. B. In drier talus {{adjacent to the}} mossy areas are various plant species, such as eastern skunk cabbage Symplocarpus foetidus and Angelica atropurpurea, upon which Succinea sp. B has also been found. During periods of heavy water flow, dew, or rain, when the vegetation is saturated, the snails have been observed actively crawling on the vegetation. During drier times, both species of snails attach themselves to the underside of leaves with a mucous epiphragm. In the patch of watercress, the vegetation is dense <b>and</b> <b>lush.</b> Although the watercress is dominant, other species include Angelica atropurpurea, jewelweed Impatiens capensis and Impatiens pallida, forget-me-nots Myosotis scorpioides, various mints Mentha spp., and poison ivy Toxicodendron radicans, which again support Succinea sp. B but not Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. The ledges where Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is found clearly comprise an early successional sere, periodically rejuvenated to a bare rock substrate by flood waters.|$|E

25|$|His {{important}} early overtures are Rip Van Winkle, Melpomene, and Thalia. Set around Washington Irving's tale of {{the same}} name, Rip Van Winkle was his first orchestral work that established his claim to fame in Europe and America. Melpomene is a rich <b>and</b> <b>lush</b> work reminiscent of Wagner, and the comedy overture Thalia is imitative of Mendelssohn's light and lively style. A choral/orchestral piece, The Lily Nymph, presents a mixture of techniques borrowed from Mendelssohn and Impressionism.|$|E
25|$|The Preserve {{is located}} in the Sonoran Desert, which contain one of the most rare and {{threatened}} types of riparian environments, cottonwood-willow forests.

These environments are particularly important to many forms of wildlife, and it is estimated that at least 80% of Arizona's wildlife depend on these riparian environments. Because of the year-round water <b>and</b> <b>lush</b> vegetation, the Preserve is considered to be an oasis in the Sonoran Desert, and is home to approximately 300 different bird species, as well as numerous other wildlife.|$|E
25|$|Lieutenant Bowen's {{settlement}} at Risdon Cove {{had been}} poorly sited.

Bowen's contingent had arrived on 11 September 1803 at the end of what was probably a wet winter. The grassy woodlands around Risdon Cove were verdant <b>and</b> <b>lush,</b> and the creek was at full flow. However, after a long hot summer between December 1803 and February 1804, during which the Risdon Cove encampment received not a single day of rain whatsoever, the creek was dried up completely and the grass and woodlands parched.|$|E
