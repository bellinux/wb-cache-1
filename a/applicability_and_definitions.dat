40|$|This paper {{presents}} a model theory of lexical semantics that {{is compatible with}} theories in the Montagovian tradition. Lexical expressions are modeled as subsets or "subspaces " in a "semantic space". A unique representation is defined for subspaces of the semantic space. Tms unique representation is called the "normal form " of the lexical denotation. A Boolean algebra of normal forms is developed, in wmch lexical entailment is Boolean inclusion. The presentation {{in the body of}} the paper is informal, making use of exam-ples to illustrate the theory and to indicate the range of <b>applicability.</b> Formal <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> proofs in support of the presentation are given in the Appendix...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{variability}} of terms <b>and</b> <b>definitions</b> of Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) represents a missed opportunity for optimal monitoring of safety of immunization in pregnancy. In 2014, the Brighton Collaboration Foundation and the World Health Organization (WHO) collaborated {{to address this}} gap. MethodsTwo Brighton Collaboration interdisciplinary taskforces were formed. A landscape analysis included: (1) a systematic literature review of adverse event definitions used in vaccine studies during pregnancy; (2) a worldwide stakeholder survey of available terms and definitions; (3) {{and a series of}} taskforce meetings. Based on available evidence, taskforces proposed key terms <b>and</b> concept <b>definitions</b> to be refined, prioritized, and endorsed by a global expert consultation convened by WHO in Geneva, Switzerland in July 2014. ResultsUsing pre-specified criteria, 45 maternal and 62 fetal/neonatal events were prioritized, and key terms <b>and</b> concept <b>definitions</b> were endorsed. In addition recommendations to further improve safety monitoring of immunization in pregnancy programs were specified. This includes elaboration of disease concepts into standardized case <b>definitions</b> with sufficient <b>applicability</b> <b>and</b> positive predictive value to be of use for monitoring the safety of immunization in pregnancy globally, as well as the development of guidance, tools, and datasets in support of a globally concerted approach. ConclusionsThere is a need to improve the safety monitoring of immunization in pregnancy programs. A consensus list of terms <b>and</b> concept <b>definitions</b> of key events for monitoring immunization in pregnancy is available. Immediate actions to further strengthen monitoring of immunization in pregnancy programs are identified and recommended...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{background}} paper is to summarize the current literature and identify criteria and a process {{for the evaluation of}} <b>applicability</b> (feasibility) <b>and</b> transferability (generalizability) of evidence to public health practice and policy. The paper was then used to develop a tool (Appendix 1) to assist public health managers and planners in decision-making about program priorities for their community. The evaluation of <b>applicability</b> <b>and</b> transferability follows from the critical appraisal of any research; once the study results are judged to be valid, how do you determine whether the intervention could work with similar expected outcomes in other jurisdictions? Methods The literature reviewed for this document included all literature (grey and published) used for the environmental scan for the NCCMT, references found in bibliographies to identify other relevant work that would contribute specific concepts for evaluation of <b>applicability</b> <b>and</b> transferability, and citations from an updated (June 2006 to February 2007) review using refined search methods to focus on the concepts of <b>applicability</b> <b>and</b> transferability...|$|R
