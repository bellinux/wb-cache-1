40|$|The {{effect of}} proline analogs on peptidyl proline {{hydroxylation}} {{has been studied}} in vivo using <b>aerated</b> <b>root</b> slices of Daucus carota. One analog, 3, 4 -dehydroproline, acted at micromolar concentrations to rapidly and selectively inhibit peptidyl proline hydroxylation. A structurally altered hydroxyproline-rich cell wall glycoprotein was synthesized and secreted by dehydroproline-treated tissue. The capacity to hydroxylate proline recovered slowly following a short pulse treatment with the analog, with a halftime for recovery of about 24 hours. Recovery was not altered by supplying exogenous proline. Dehydroproline {{had little effect on}} the induction of nitrate reductase by nitrate, nor on wound-induced increases in amino acid uptake and protein synthesis. In contrast, other proline analogs inhibit proline hydroxylation only at millimolar concentrations. It is hypothesized that dehydroproline acts as an enzyme-activated suicide inhibitor of prolyl hydroxylase. This analog should become a useful tool for elucidating the functional significance of hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the potential role of restricted phloem export, or import of substances from the roots in the leaf growth response to root hypoxia. In addition, the effects of root hypoxia on abscisic acid (ABA) and zeatin riboside (ZR) levels were measured and their effects on in vitro growth determined. Imposition of root hypoxia in the dark when transpirational water flux was minimal delayed the reduction in leaf growth until the following light period. Restriction of phloem transport by stem girdling did not eliminate the hypoxia-induced reduction in leaf growth. In vitro growth of leaf discs was inhibited {{in the presence of}} xylem sap collected from hypoxic roots, and also by millimolar ABA. Disc growth was promoted by sap from <b>aerated</b> <b>roots</b> and by 0. 1 micromolar ZR. The flux of both ABA and ZR was reduced in xylem sap from hypoxic roots. Leaf ABA transiently increased twofold after 24 hours of hypoxia exposure but there were no changes in leaf cytokinin levels...|$|R
40|$|Water {{transport}} {{was examined}} in solution culture grown seedlings of aspen (Populus tremuloides) after short-term exposures of roots to exogenous ethylene. Ethylene significantly increased stomatal conductance, root hydraulic conductivity (Lp), and root oxygen uptake in hypoxic seedlings. <b>Aerated</b> <b>roots</b> that {{were exposed to}} ethylene also showed enhanced Lp. An ethylene action inhibitor, silver thiosulphate, significantly reversed the enhancement of Lp by ethylene. A short-term exposure of excised roots to ethylene significantly enhanced the root water flow (Qv), measured by pressurizing the roots at 0. 3 MPa. The Qv values in ethylene-treated roots declined significantly when 50 μm HgCl 2 {{was added to the}} root medium and this decline was reversed by the addition of 20 mm 2 -mercaptoethanol. The results suggest that the response of Qv to ethylene involves mercury-sensitive water channels and that root-absorbed ethylene enhanced water permeation through roots, resulting in an increase in root water transport and stomatal opening in hypoxic seedlings...|$|R
40|$|The extensin {{component}} of primary cell walls {{has generally been}} {{considered to be an}} intrinsically insoluble cell wall glycoprotein. Recent data have established that cell wall extensin is in fact secreted in a soluble monomeric form which slowly becomes insolubilized in the cell wall probably through the oxidative formation of isodityrosine cross-links. We now show that isolated cell walls from <b>aerated</b> <b>root</b> slices of Daucus carota have the capacity to insolubilize extensin through the formation of isodityrosine. This in vitro cross-linking is specific for the extensin glycoprotein, as other wall proteins are not cross-linked by the isolated wall system. Although extensin can be cross-linked in solution by peroxidase and H 2 O 2, dityrosine and not isodityrosine is the phenolic cross-link formed. Wall-catalyzed cross-linking of soluble extensin is inhibited by l-ascorbate, and both the initial rate and total extent of cross-linking are inhibited by acidic pH in the physiological range (pH 4 to 6). We suggest several mechanisms by which acid might inhibit cross-linking and propose that cytoplasmic factors (ascorbate and/or hydrogen ions) may regulate the solubility of extensin in vivo...|$|R

40|$|This {{investigation}} presents metabolic {{evidence to}} show that in 4 - to 5 -day-old roots of maize (Zea mays hybrid GH 5010) exposed to low external O 2 concentrations, the stele receives inadequate O 2 for oxidative phosphorylation, while the cortex continues to respire even when the external solution is at zero O 2 and the roots rely solely on aerenchyma for O 2 transport. Oxygen uptake rates (micromoles per cubic centimeter per hour) declined at higher external O 2 concentrations in excised segments from whole roots than from the isolated cortex; critical O 2 pressures for respiration were greater than 0. 26 moles per cubic meter O 2 (aerated solution) for the whole root and only 0. 075 moles per cubic meter O 2 for the cortex. For plants with their shoots excised and the cut stem in air, ethanol concentrations (moles per cubic meter) in roots exposed to 0. 06 moles per cubic meter O 2 were 3. 3 times higher in the stele than in the cortex, whereas this ethanol gradient across the root was not evident in roots exposed to 0 moles per cubic meter O 2. Alanine concentrations (moles per cubic meter) in the stele of roots exposed to 0. 13 and 0. 09 moles per cubic meter O 2 increased by 26 and 44 %, respectively, above the levels found for <b>aerated</b> <b>roots,</b> whereas alanine in the cortex was unchanged; the increase in stelar alanine concentration was not accompanied by changes in the concentration of free amino acids other than alanine. For plants with their shoots intact, alcohol dehydrogenase and pyruvate decarboxylase activities (micromoles per gram protein per minute) in roots exposed to 0. 13 moles per cubic meter O 2 increased in the stele by 40 to 50 % over the activity in <b>aerated</b> <b>roots,</b> whereas there was no appreciable increase in alcohol dehydrogenase and pyruvate decarboxylase activity in the cortex of these roots. More convincingly, for roots receiving O 2 solely from the shoots via the aerenchyma, pyruvate decarboxylase in the cortex was in an “inactive” state, whereas pyruvate decarboxylase in the stele was in an “active” state. These results suggest that for roots in O 2 -free solutions, the aerenchyma provides adequate O 2 for respiration in the cortex but not in the stele, and this was supported by a change in pyruvate decarboxylase in the cortex to an active state when the O 2 supply to the roots via the aerenchyma was blocked...|$|R
40|$|Most {{species of}} the modern family Isoëtaceae (Quillworts) some other modern hydrophytes, use a {{metabolic}} pathway for carbon fixation that involves uptake of sedimentary carbon and enrichment of CO 2 in internal gas spaces as a carbon-concentrating mechanism. This metabolism, which is related to ‘aquatic CAM’, is characterized by morphological, physiological and biochemical adaptations for decreasing photorespirative loss, <b>aerating</b> <b>roots</b> and maintaining high growth rates in anoxic, oligotrophic, stressed environments. Some of the closest relatives of the Isoëtaceae were the ‘arborescent lycopsids’, which were among the dominant taxa in the coal swamps found in lowland ecosystems during the Carboniferous and Permian periods (approx. 300 Ma). Morphological, ecological and geochemical evidence supports {{the hypothesis that the}} arborescent lycopsids had an unusual metabolism similar to that of modern Isoëtaceae and processed a biogeochemically significant proportion of organically fixed carbon over a period of about 100 million years in the late Palaeozoic. The temporal coincidence between the dominance of plants with this metabolism and an anomalous global atmosphere (high O 2; low CO 2) supports the idea that biosphere feedbacks are important in regulating global climatic homeostasis. The potential influence of this metabolism on the global carbon cycle and its specific adaptive function suggest that it should perhaps be considered a fourth major photosynthetic pathway...|$|R

Sand and soil act as the substrate and artificial sea-water with salinity of 15 is used in cultivation. Shorter waterlogging time (inundated for about 2 similar to 4 h) promotes the growth of K. candal seedlings, while longer time (inundated more than 8 h) or no waterlogging (0 h) inhibits their growth. The number and length of <b>aerating</b> <b>roots</b> increase {{with the increase of}} waterlogging time. Under existing conditions, the optimal waterlogging time for the growth of K. candel seedlings is about 2 similar to 4 h in every tide cycle. Compared with other treatments, the 2 h sanded treatments obtain the highest biomass of seedlings, have the lowest mass loss of hypocotyl and broaden the photosynthetic area by increasing the area per leaf after 70 -d cultivation. And the soil treatments have the similar tendency. However, waterlogging for 8 h in every tide cycle is critical for normal development of seedlings. K. candel seedlings are highly tolerant to waterlogging and a proper waterlogging is beneficial to the growth of K. candel seedlings...|$|R

40|$|We {{present data}} showing that arsenic (As) was codeposited with organic carbon (OC) in Bengal Delta sediments as As and OC {{concentrations}} are highly (p < 0. 001) positively correlated in core profiles collected from widely dispersed geographical sites with different sedimentary depositional histories. Analysis of modern day depositional environments {{revealed that the}} As−OC correlations observed in cores are due to As retention and high OC inputs in vegetated zones of the deltaic environment. We hypothesize that elevated concentrations of As occur in vegetated wetland sediments due to concentration and retention of arsenate in <b>aerated</b> <b>root</b> zones and animal burrows where copious iron(III) oxides are deposited. On burial of the sediment, degradation of organic carbon from plant and animal biomass detritus provides the reducing conditions to dissolve iron(III) oxides and release arsenite into the porewater. As tubewell abstracted aquifer water is an invaluable resource on which much of Southeast Asia is now dependent, this increased understanding of the processes responsible for As buildup and release will identify, through knowledge of the palaeosedimentary environment, which sediments are at most risk of having high arsenic concentrations in porewater.

40|$|In higher plants {{it is now}} {{generally}} considered that glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) plays only a small or negligible role in ammonia assimilation. To test this specific point, comparative studies of 15 NH 4 + assimilation were undertaken with a GDH 1 -null mutant of Zea mays and a related (but not strictly isogenic) GDH 1 -positive wild type from which this mutant was derived. The kinetics of 15 NH 4 + assimilation into free amino acids and total reduced nitrogen were monitored in both roots and shoots of 2 -week-old seedlings supplied with 5 millimolar 99 % (15 NH 4) 2 SO 4 via the <b>aerated</b> <b>root</b> medium in hydroponic culture over a 24 -h period. The GDH 1 -null mutant, with a 10 - to 15 -fold lower total root GDH activity {{in comparison to the}} wild type, was found to exhibit a 40 to 50 % lower rate of 15 NH 4 + assimilation into total reduced nitrogen. Observed rates of root ammonium assimilation were 5. 9 and 3. 1 micromoles per hour per gram fresh weight for the wild type and mutant, respectively. The lower rate of 15 NH 4 + assimilation in the mutant was associated with lower rates of labeling of several free amino acids (including glutamate, glutamine-amino N, aspartate, asparagine-amino N, and alanine) in both roots and shoots of the mutant in comparison to the wild type. Qualitatively, these labeling kinetics appear consistent with a reduced flux of 15 N via glutamate in the GDH 1 -null mutant. However, the responses of the two genotypes to the potent inhibitor of glutamine synthetase, methionine sulfoximine, and differences in morphology of the two genotypes (particularly a lower shoot:root ratio in the GDH 1 -null mutant) urge caution in concluding that GDH 1 is solely responsible for these differences in ammonia assimilation rate...|$|R

Neste trabalho foram estudados a germinação das sementes e o crescimento inicial das plantas de Calophyllum brasiliense, em condições de hipoxia. As sementes de C brasiliense não são fotoblásticas, sobrevivem ao menos três meses submersas, mas germinam apenas em solo bem drenado. A inundação não inibe o crescimento da planta.

40|$|On {{the west}} side of the San Joaquin Valley, California, {{groundwater}} tables have risen after several decades of irrigation. A regional semi-permeable layer at 100 m depth (Corcoran Clay) combined with over-irrigation and leaching is the major cause of the groundwater rise. Subsurface drain systems were installed from the 60 ¿s to the 80 ¿s to remove excess water and maintain an <b>aerated</b> <b>root</b> zone. However, drainage water resulting from these subsurface systems contained trace elements like selenium, which were determined at toxic levels to fish and waterfowl. To maintain healthy levels of salt and selenium in the San Joaquin River, the natural drain out of the San Joaquin Valley, outflow of drainage water from farms was severely restricted or completely eliminated. Several on-farm management methods are being investigated to maintain agricultural production without off-farm drainage. One method is drainage water reuse through blending with irrigation water. Another method is to reuse drainage water consecutively, where drainage water from one field is used as irrigation water for another field. Progressively more salt tolerant crops need to be grown in such a system along the reuse path, and salts can eventually be harvested using solar evaporators. A method described in this paper aims to reduce the volume of drainage water during the growing season by increasing shallow groundwater use by crops before it is drained from the field. Five years of crops were grown on two weighing lysimeters using drip irrigation. Two years of cotton were grown under high frequency drip irrigation (applications up to 10 times a day), followed by two years of safflower (early season crop) and one year of alfalfa (perennial) under low frequency drip irrigation (twice a week). One lysimeter maintained a shallow groundwater table at 1. 0 -m below soil surface, while the other lysimeter was freely drained at the bottom (3. 0 -m below soil surface). High frequency irrigation requires more irrigation water over a season than low frequency irrigation in the presence of shallow groundwater, since low frequency irrigation induces more shallow groundwater use by crops. Groundwater use for cotton was measured as 8 % of total seasonal crop water use, while measurements under safflower showed that 25 % of seasonal crop water use came from groundwater. Measurements under alfalfa, in its first year of establishment, showed 15 % of seasonal crop water use coming from the groundwater. To maintain a sustainable system, leaching of salts need to occur. Leaching under the proposed irrigation/drainage management system would occur in the early growing season with winter precipitation, pre-plant irrigation and the first irrigation of the growing season, when the water table can be maintained at shallower depths through restriction of the outflow of the subsurface drainage system (groundwater control) ...|$|R

40|$|Furrow is the {{dominant}} irrigation method for agriculture throughout the world. However, due to water use inefficiencies, only about 50 % of the water that reaches the field {{is used by the}} crop, the remainder at times negatively impacting the environment. This research explored the potential of subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) to raise water use efficiency (WUE) of cotton produced on a heavy clay soil, and to minimize the negative environmental impact of irrigation water. SDI cotton irrigated at the rate of 75 % daily crop evapo-transpirational demand (ETc) produced yield equivalent to, or greater than, that with SDI at 120 / 105 ETc in both seasons in Emerald, Queensland. Lint yield of SDI 75 % ETc was comparable to the conventional furrow method in 2001 / 02 season and less by 18 % in 2002 / 03 season, but used only approximately half of the water input (52 %). The SDI crop irrigated at 50 % ETc showed enhanced crop earliness and WUE, but had lower lint yield, whereas higher SDI irrigation levels (> 90 % ETc) delayed crop maturity without benefits for yield or WUE. Furrow registered the highest drainage and runoff over the two seasons (114 mm and 224 mm) compared with the SDI at 105 / 120 ETc (65 mm and 32 mm) whereas SDI 90 % ETc had no runoff but leakage of 17 mm and neither drainage nor runoff were observed at SDI at 50 and 75 % ETc. It was hypothesized that at higher irrigation rates, SDI crops experience lack of oxygen in the root zone, which becomes a limiting factor for improving WUE at higher irrigation rates at and above 90 % ETc for cotton in heavy clay soil. The potential of subsurface oxygation (irrigating oxygen-rich water to plants through drip tape- the details about oxygation approach, mechanism and terminology are presented in Bhattarai et al., 2005 c) using aerated irrigation water (mixing 12 % air by volume of water using Mazzei model venturi for in-line air injection) or hydrogen peroxide solution (at 0. 5 ml H 2 O 2 L- 1 of irrigation water throughout the irrigation cycle) viii was therefore investigated at a range of soil moisture levels in the glasshouse, screenhouse and outside at Rockhampton, Queensland. Following irrigation events soil O 2 declined by 45 % in non-aerated plots while in aerated plots soil O 2 decreased by only 25 %. Oxygen measurements in the rhizosphere over a 72 -hour period during the flowering stage revealed greater oxygen concentration with aerated treatments compared with the control at both field capacity (8. 1 vs 7. 1 mg L- 1) and deficit (9. 2 vs 8. 1 mg L- 1) soil moisture conditions. Yield was increased on average by 86, 20 and 21 % for soybean, cotton and tomato, respectively, due to aeration across soil moisture levels and types of aeration. Such increase in yield was associated with greater number of pods for soybean, bolls and their individual weight for cotton and fruit size in tomato. Aeration treatments also increased water use by plants and were associated with greater WUE in all experiments. The effect of aeration was significant on the rate of net photosynthesis per unit leaf area when pots were aerated, but instantaneous leaf stomatal conductance and unit leaf transpiration rates were not affected. However, higher stem sap flow rates indicated greater canopy transpiration over longer time intervals in <b>aerated</b> treatments. Higher <b>root</b> weight and soil respiration were observed in aerated treatments compared with the control. Hence, aeration-induced root functioning was arguably responsible for greater fruit set and yield in all three crops, while in vegetable soybean greater canopy interception of radiation and greater total vegetative biomass were also responsible for additional yield benefits, and in tomato the effect was due to higher leaf area, chlorophyll content, and bigger fruit. Salinity is a major environmental threat {{in many parts of the}} world. Salinity in clay soils is often associated with sodicity, which reduces the porosity in the soil thereby reducing soil oxygen concentration. The effect of oxygation (with aerated water) for SDI crops in a range of salinities (tomato: 2. 0, 4. 0, 8. 6, 10. 0; cotton and ix soybean: 2. 0, 8. 0, 14. 0, 20. 0 dS m- 1 ECe) in heavy clay soils was valuated. Oxygation on average increased yield of tomato, vegetable soybean and cotton by 38, 12 and 18 percent respectively, but yields decreased significantly with increasing salinity levels. Aeration of saline soil increased WUE for fruit and biomass in all three species but not the instantaneous WUE, measured as μmol CO 2 fixed per mmol H 2 O transpired, with the exception of cotton. Aeration increased, and salinity decreased, cumulative transpiration as determined by stem sap flow over a two week period during flowering in vegetable soybean. Plants in aerated treatments showed increased stem diameter, improved membrane permeability expressed by reduced relative leakage ratio and possibly enhanced ion regulation as revealed by greater sodium exclusion and intact root membrane as revealed in the TS of <b>aerated</b> <b>roots</b> in the saline soils. The increase in yield in tomato and cotton was also accompanied by increased harvest index, greater fruit size, higher fruit number, shoot: root ratio, and lower water stress index. The rate of net leaf photosynthesis increased with aeration and decreased with salinity in cotton and soybean; however, in tomato the aeration effect on photosynthesis was not significant although salinity did significantly reduce net leaf photosynthesis. Aeration improved selective membrane permeability as evidenced by reduced lectrolyte leakage. Hence it is suggested that aeration helps exclude the ingress of salts into the plants and increases uptake of water and nutrients for growth in saline environments. Evidence from these controlled environment experiments warrants the commercial-scale testing of the oxygation technology for application to the agricultural and horticultural industries especially to add value to growers’ investments in SDI and to diminish potential negative impacts of over-use of irrigation water...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} that elevated root zone {{dissolved inorganic carbon}} (DIC) concentrations could increase yield and quality of Lycopersicon esculentum (L.) Mill. cv Daniella when combined with salinity in an agricultural production system was investigated. Root zone DIC was modified by supplying CO 2 -enriched irrigation solutions (1 g l- 1), NaHCO 3 -enriched irrigation solutions (10 mM) or <b>aerating</b> the <b>roots</b> with ambient air or with air enriched with 5000 ppm CO 2 Plants were supplied with either low electrical conductivity (EC = 0. 25 S m- 1) nutrient solutions or with nutrient solutions supplemented with 55 mM NaCl to generate a high EC (0. 7 S m- 1). Plants were grown in plastic covered tunnel houses in two growing seasons to determine whether seasonal variations could alter the influence of root zone DIC on growth and yield. Although there were differences in vegetative and yield characteristics in the different seasons, no modification of the response to changes in root zone DIC was observed. With increased EC, growth and yield were decreased by 14 and 22 %, respectively, relative to low EC treatments. High EC increased the total soluble solids (TSS) by ca. 18 % and titratable acids by ca. 32 % relative to low EC treatments. After storage for 2 weeks at 15 °C, fruit of high EC treated plants was 12 % less firm than that of low EC plants and no differences in TSS or acidity were found. At low EC, the HCO 3 - treatment decreased total yield and the yield of marketable fruit (> 80 g) by ca. 22 %, probably due to occlusion of drippers in this treatment. At high salinity levels, irrigation with DIC-enriched nutrient solutions had no significant effect on fruit yield or quality. Aeration of the roots with air containing 5000 ppm CO 2 increased the average marketable fruit weight by 7 %, but had no significant effect on total yield or quality in comparison to controls. Aeration of the root zone with air containing 5000 ppm CO 2 also reduced the incidence of blossom-end rot by 57 %. Overall, however, the influence of DIC enrichment of irrigation solutions and aeration of the root zone with air containing elevated CO 2 on fruit yield and quality {{is unlikely to be}} of commercial significance. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Plants grow in {{a dynamic}} environment, which often, imposes {{constraints}} on growth and development. Among the adverse environmental factors commonly encountered by land plants, flooding or waterlogging which imposes a temporary root hypoxia (1 - 2 % oxygen). Hypoxia stress jeopardizes plant survival, and therefore induces tremendous {{damage on the}} agricultural production and natural ecosystem. Most previous studies of biological and biochemical alterations in plants, due to hypoxic stress, have focused on sugar metabolism. However, few data, regarding the effect of root hypoxia on nitrogen (N) metabolism have recently become available. The aim of our work is to study the impact of root hypoxia on nitrogen metabolism in the model plant "Medicago truncatula. " Our results showed that root hypoxia leads to {{a significant increase in}} shoot biomass (MF and MS) with increased stem elongation and number of leaves during a transitional period of almost 5 weeks before inducing plant death. Effects on primary metabolism were followed by metabolomic analysis (GC-MS), labeling of nitrogen (15 N) and expression of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism. Root hypoxia induced the expected rearrangement of carbon and nitrogen in the root but interestingly it induced significant changes in C and N metabolisms in the aerated shoot. Hypoxia-induced changes in shoot biomass and metabolism were obtained in split-root experiment where only part of the root system was submitted to hypoxia. The response of the <b>aerated</b> shoot to <b>root</b> hypoxia suggests a communication between root and shoot upon hypoxia aiming at a coherent adaptive response at the whole plant level. The nature of this communication deserves to be more thoroughly investigated...|$|R
40|$|Rice (Oryza sativa L.) {{is one of}} few crop {{species that}} can he productively grown in both wetland and dryland conditions, Yields of rice may have to rise by 40 to 60 % over the next 20 to 30 yr because of the demand from {{increasing}} population. The requirement for sulfur will rise by a comparable level, and unless fertilizer inputs increase, more sulfur deficiency can be expected, threatening the attainment of yield targets. Management of the sulfur nutrition of rice varies {{depending on whether the}} soil is submerged throughout the crop cycle as in paddy cultivation, <b>aerated</b> in the <b>root</b> zone as in upland production systems, or intermittently flooded as in rain-fed lowland, aerobic, and water-deficit irrigation production systems. Under upland conditions, which generally use different cultivars than those grown in wetland conditions, rice attains greater rooting depth than in submerged soils. Sulfur nutrition of rice under upland conditions has much in common with that of other field crops. In submerged soil, access to sulphur is limited by the shallow root system, with > 90 % of roots confined to the top 20 cm of the soil. Low redox potential causes reduction of sulfate to sulfides, some of which are toxic (H,S), and others low in solubility (FeS, ZnS). Moreover, the slower mineralization of organically bound sulfur decreases availability of sulfur to rice in submerged soils. Hence, sulfur deficiency has increased in prevalence in wetland rice. Negative sulfur budgets have been estimated in several countries where rice is grown without sulfur fertilizers, especially when residue is removed or burned. Further research is needed to develop optimal sulfur nutrient management for the emerging water-saving production systems where soil redox potential fluctuates over time, affecting the mineralization of organically hound sulfur and changing the stability of reduced or oxidized forms of sulfur...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the hypothesis that in a nutrient dominated catchment and estuary subject to extreme seasonal variation and large tidal inundations, physical processes play a substantial role in the nutrient status. This investigation also aimed to {{provide insight into the}} impact of high anthropogenic nutrient loads and the effect of runoff events, areas where limited research has been conducted in wet dry tropical, macrotidal systems. Buffalo Creek, Northern Territory, Australia, is a wet dry tropical, macrotidal system that has been subject to substantial anthropogenic nutrient inputs over a 36 year period. Levels of nutrients in the water column exceeded the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council and Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand (ANZECC/ARMCANZ) guidelines under all seasonal and tidal conditions but high levels of nutrients were not reflected in the sediment. Buffalo Creek is well mixed with stratification only occurring during periods of minimal flow (neap tides). The mixing plots revealed that different suites of nutrient processes occur under different conditions and that although biological transformations are the dominant mechanism for nitrogen on neap tides, physical processes {{play a key role in}} nutrient status during spring tides and wet seasons. The importance of physical processes was supported by high variations in turbidity and the large contribution of particulate nitrogen and phosphorus. The creek frequently experiences scouring by tide and/or flooding and the resuspension and transport of nutrients associated with particulate matter is a key factor in determining the status of nutrients in Buffalo Creek. Interactions between sediment, porewater and overlying water were studied to elucidate key processes occurring in wet dry tropical, macrotidal systems. The first 8 - 10 cm of the porewater profiles were characterised by low nutrient concentrations with the exception of nitrate, slightly acidic pH and oxic redox levels which are associated with resuspension by strong tidal currents, flood inundations during the wet season and bioturbation providing a pathway of diffusion for NH 4 +-N and PO 4 3 [...] P to overlying water. Another potential mechanism for the low nutrient concentrations is the uptake of nutrients by mangrove roots. Nitrification occurred at these depths as the sediment was <b>aerated</b> by mangrove <b>roots,</b> bioturbation and tidal currents supporting these two proposed mechanisms. Low phosphate levels are also attributed to adsorption to Fe and Al oxyhydroxides. Sequential extraction indicated that 80 % of phosphorus was Fe and Al bound phosphate-P and polyphosphates and a statistically significant relationship between total phosphorus and total iron was observed in sediment cores. These results clearly show that at these depths physical processes not only provide a direct mechanism for nutrient release to the overlying water but also influence biological processes by aerating the sediments. Below 8 - 10 cm, NH 4 +-N and PO 4 3 [...] P concentrations rapidly increased. The dominant process for nitrogen at depth was ammonification. Substantial increases in porewater phosphate corresponded to a decline in Eh, associated with the anaerobic conversion of Fe(III) to soluble Fe(II). Experiments were conducted focusing on the influence of salinity and intense mixing on nutrient release from sediments. The mechanisms of nutrient release experienced when the sediment was intensely resuspended in seawater, representative of spring tide inundations, was an initial porewater exchange with the overlying water followed by competition between phosphate and seawater anions for exchange sites, ammonification and nitrification. The major processes occurring in sediment resuspended in oxic freshwater, representative of wet season flooding, included phosphate and ammonium release from porewater, ammonification, nitrification, continued slow release of phosphate for neutral or alkaline sediments and adsorption to iron oxyhydroxides for acidic sediments. The results indicate that mixing and salinity are key factors in the status of nutrients in wet dry tropical, macrotidal systems. Lead- 210 dating was conducted to provide a chronology of the sediment profile, to determine if urbanisation impacted the system and if this dating method is applicable to wet dry tropical, macrotidal systems. Dated sediment cores indicated that the sewage treatment plant and urbanisation have impacted on the creek. The sediment of the creek and floodplain contained a record of this impact despite surface mixing caused by macrotides and wet season inundations and bioturbation to a lesser extent. The results show that it is difficult, but not impossible, to establish a definitive date for sediments subjected to physical and biological mixing. The success of dating in these areas is dependent on careful site selection. Cores should be selected from sites that accumulate sediment regularly and are sheltered from disturbances. These results suggest that although it may not always be possible to achieve yearly resolution because of mixing it may still be possible to show substantial impacts on a decadal scale. Nutrients and PbIR were successfully used as chemostratigraphic markers in this system, despite the potential mobility of nutrients in sediments. These profiles also provide important information about mixing which is a key factor in nutrient status in wet dry tropical, macrotidal systems. The results of this study clearly show that physical processes are of great importance, influencing nutrient status in wet dry tropical, macrotidal environments. The results of these studies have been used to produce a conceptual model for nutrient release in Buffalo Creek under different tidal and seasonal conditions...|$|R
