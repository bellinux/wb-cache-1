40|$|We study {{a problem}} in a {{procurement}} setting in which an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) wants to procure a set of items from a set of suppliers. Each supplier incurs a cost for supplying any subset/bundle of items, and each supplier’s cost information is known only to him. The goal is to determine (i) an efficient <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> to items and (ii) appropriate payments for suppliers. We formulate the problem of determining which supplier should supply what items as an integer program. We develop a method, {{which is based on}} the ellipsoid method, that solves the dual of the linear relaxation of the problem in polynomial time. We also show that the linear relaxation has an integral optimal solution. ...|$|E
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Over {{the past few}} decades, the concept of {{integrated}} logistics system {{has emerged as a}} new management philosophy, which aims to increase distribution efficiency. Such a concept recognizes the interdependence among the location of facilities, the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> and customers to facilities and vehicle route structures around depots. In this study, in order to emphasize the interdependence among these, we build a model for the integration of location and routing decisions. We propose our model on realistic assumptions such as the number of vehicles assigned to each facility is a decision variable and the installing cost of a facility depends on how many vehicles will be assigned to that facility. We also analyze the opportunity cost of ignoring vehicle routes while locating facilities and show the computational performance of integrated solution approach. We propose a greedy type heuristic for the model, which is based on a newly structured savings function. Selçuk, BarışM. S...|$|E
40|$|First draft: April 1996 This draft: October 1996 This paper {{investigates the}} {{rationale}} for statistical discrimination and networks effects in the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> credit.

40|$|Selection <b>of</b> <b>{{suppliers}}</b> and <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> optimum volumes to suppliers is {{a strategic}} business decision. This paper presents a decision support method for supplier selection and the optimal <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> volumes in a supplier portfolio. The {{requirements for the}} method were gathered during a case study that was conducted within the logistics unit of Shell Chemicals Europe. The proposed method {{is based on the}} classical view by Sprague and Carlson of sequence and interaction of the different phases of decision making in a decision support system and supports Kraljic’s portfolio approach for supplier management. This method aims to help the managers in making decisions on the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> volumes to <b>suppliers</b> while simultaneously trying to satisfy conflicting objectives of improvement in benefit and reduction in risk. A mathematical model to struc-ture the problem is presented, knowledge elicited from the managers is used to parameterize the mathemati-cal model and a multi-objective, hierarchical optimization procedure produces ‘trade-off’ outputs.

40|$|Strategic {{evaluation}} <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> performance assists {{firms in}} improving their operations across {{a variety of}} dimensions. Specifically, it aids in supplier process improvement, which in turn enhances firm performance, allows for optimal <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> resources for <b>supplier</b> development programs, and assists managers in restructuring their supplier network based on performance. In order to address these issues, this article proposes a methodology for effective supplier performance evaluation based on data envelopment analysis (DEA), a multi-factor productivity analysis technique. The efficiencies derived from the DEA model are utilized in conjunction with managerial performance ratings in identifying supplier clusters, which are categorized into high performers and efficient (HE), high performers and inefficient (HI), low performers and efficient (LE), and low performers and inefficient (LI). Effective benchmarks from the HE cluster are identified for improving the operations <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> in the HI, LE, and LI clusters.

40|$|National audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{integrated}} facility location and supplier selection decisions {{for the design of}} supply chain network with reliable and unreliable suppliers. Two problems are addressed: (1) facility location/supplier selection; and (2) facility location/supplier reliability. We first consider the facility location and supplier selections problem where all the suppliers are reliable. The decisions concern the selection of suppliers, the location of distribution centres (DCs), the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> to DCs and the allocation of retailers to DCs. The objective is to minimise fixed DCs location costs, inventory and safety stock costs at the DCs and ordering costs and transportation costs across the network. The introduction of inventory costs and safety stock costs leads to a non-linear NP-hard optimisation problem. To solve this problem, a Lagrangian relaxation-based approach is developed. For the second problem, a two-period decision model is proposed in which selected suppliers are reliable in the first period and can fail in the second period. The corresponding facility location/supplier reliability problem is formulated as a non-linear stochastic programming problem. A Monte Carlo optimisation approach combining the sample average approximation scheme and the Lagrangian relaxation-based approach is proposed. Computational results are presented to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed approaches...|$|E
30|$|In the 90 s, {{with the}} {{improvement}} of production processes and spreading of reengineering patterns, managers of many industries were not satisfied only with {{the improvement of}} internal processes and flexibility in corporate capabilities. They {{found out that the}} suppliers of parts and materials have to also produce materials with the best quality and cost and distributors of the products must have a close relationship with the market development policies of the producers. With such an attitude, logistic approaches, supply chain, and its management have emerged. Conditions of global competition and environmental sensitivity have made corporations responsible for collecting the rejected products to recover, recycle, or devastation them to maintain the environment and gain the profit of rejected products that have been abandoned. Collecting products after the consumption by customers and returning them to supply chain or devastating them bring up the closed-loop supply chain problem. The concept of the closed-loop supply chain has gained attention as a result of identification forward and reverse supply chains that are managed seamlessly. In the last 3 decades, with the highlighting of the importance of supply chain management to the industrialists, the role of coordination and integration of different components of the supply chain has become stronger in creating competitive advantages and the concept of integration {{has become one of the}} most important aspects of the supply chain management system. This concept addresses the dependence between the location of facilities, <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> and customers to the facilities, the structure of transport system and routing them, and inventory control system.|$|E
40|$|Purpose This paper {{examines}} {{the competition between}} buying firms for the supplier’s competitive resources. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine how indirect capabilities – the ability to access external resources – can help in obtaining preferential resource allocation from suppliers. Design/methodology/approach Partial least squares structural equation modeling is used to analyze data of 163 buying firms that assess preferential resource allocation from suppliers. Findings Two indirect capabilities (a buying firm’s selection capability and relational capability) positively influence the firm’s competitive advantage. These relations are significantly mediated by preferential resource <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>suppliers.</b> The impact of preferential resource allocation appeared stronger for manufacturing firms than for service firms. Research limitations/implications This study’s data set represents the buyer’s assessment of suppliers’ resource allocation. Future research should aim for dyadic data for further validation. In addition, due to sample size limitations, this study’s data does not allow sector segmentation. A larger study that provides insights into segmentation is suggested for future research. Practical implications The results inform managers about the relevance of the competition for supplier resources with rival firms that share suppliers, and the influence of this competition on firm competitiveness. Managers should not only focus on the supplier itself, but also on the capabilities of the supply chain management (SCM) function to recognize and integrate the supplier resources. Originality/value This study adds to the extended resource-based view literature by integrating the notion of supplier resource competition. In addition, the study shows the importance of indirect capabilities for obtaining preferential resource allocation from suppliers. Finally, the authors show the importance of separating between service and manufacturing when examining SCM practices...|$|E

40|$|This study {{develops}} an {{optimization model}} to integrate facility location and inventory control for a three-level distribution network consisting <b>of</b> a <b>supplier,</b> multiple distribution centers (DCs), and multiple retailers. The integrated model {{addressed in this}} study simultaneously determines three types of decisions: (1) facility location (optimal number, location, and size <b>of</b> DCs); (2) <b>allocation</b> (assignment <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> to located DCs and retailers to located DCs, and corresponding optimal transport mode choices); and (3) inventory control decisions on order quantities, reorder points, and amount of safety stock at each retailer and opened DC. A mixed-integer programming model is presented, which considers the carbon emission taxes, multiple transport modes, stochastic demand, and replenishment lead time. The goal is to minimize the total cost, which covers the fixed costs of logistics facilities, inventory, transportation, and CO 2 emission tax charges. The aforementioned optimal model was solved using commercial software LINGO 11. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the applications of the proposed model. The findings show that carbon emission taxes can significantly affect the supply chain structure, inventory level, and carbon emission reduction levels.

For a strategy <b>of</b> equal <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> capacity among the selected suppliers we develop closed form solutions and show that the model is robust to the number <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> from whom capacity is procured through reservation.
