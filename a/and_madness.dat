5|$|A {{series of}} many genres, {{including}} fantasy, drama, coming of age, and the British school story (which includes elements of mystery, thriller, adventure, horror and romance), {{the world of}} Harry Potter explores numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and references. According to Rowling, the main theme is death. Other major themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, <b>and</b> <b>madness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Benchley's return yielded {{two more}} short films, and his {{high-profile}} prompted negotiations for sponsorship of a Benchley radio program and numerous appearances on television shows, {{including the first}} television entertainment program ever broadcast, an untitled test program using an experimental antenna on the Empire State Building. The radio program, Melody <b>and</b> <b>Madness,</b> was more a showcase for Benchley's acting, as he {{did not participate in}} writing it. It was not well received, and was removed from the schedule.|$|E

5|$|While he was {{a student}} at Vendôme, Balzac wrote an essay called Traité de la Volonté ("Treatise on the Will"); it is {{described}} in the novel as being written by Louis Lambert. The essay discusses the philosophy of Swedenborg and others, although Balzac did not explore many of the metaphysical concepts until much later in his life. Ideas analyzed in the essay and elsewhere in the novel include the split between inward and outward existence; the presence of angels and spiritual enlightenment; and the interplay between genius <b>and</b> <b>madness.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} year of his life, Milk {{emphasized}} that gay people should be more visible to help to end the discrimination and violence against them. Although Milk had not come out to his mother before her death many years before, in his final statement during his taped prediction of his assassination, he urged others to do so: I cannot prevent anyone from getting angry, or mad, or frustrated. I can only hope that they'll turn that anger and frustration <b>and</b> <b>madness</b> into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred will step forward, so the gay doctors will come out, the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects... I hope that every professional gay will say 'enough', come forward and tell everybody, wear a sign, let the world know. Maybe that will help.|$|E

5|$|The third, and final, London season {{under the}} triumvirate was in 1946–47. Olivier played King Lear, and Richardson took {{the title role}} in Cyrano de Bergerac. Olivier would have {{preferred}} the roles to be reversed, but Richardson {{did not wish to}} attempt Lear. Olivier's Lear received good but not outstanding reviews. In his scenes of decline <b>and</b> <b>madness</b> {{towards the end of the}} play some critics found him less moving than his finest predecessors in the role. The influential critic James Agate suggested that Olivier used his dazzling stage technique to disguise a lack of feeling, a charge that the actor strongly rejected, but which was often made throughout his later career. During the run of Cyrano, Richardson was knighted, to Olivier's undisguised envy. The younger man received the accolade six months later, by which time the days of the triumvirate were numbered. The high profile of the two star actors did not endear them to the new chairman of the Old Vic governors, Lord Esher. He had ambitions to be the first head of the National Theatre and had no intention of letting actors run it. He was encouraged by Guthrie, who, having instigated the appointment of Richardson and Olivier, had come to resent their knighthoods and international fame.|$|E

25|$|Psychogenic amnesia is {{a common}} fictional plot device in many films and books and other media.

25|$|The affair {{inspired}} Sir Herbert Croft's epistolary novel Love <b>and</b> <b>Madness</b> (1780), {{an imagined}} correspondence between Hackman and Martha Ray.

One of Panizza's notable presentations was a lecture in 1891 titled Genie und Wahnsinn (Genius <b>and</b> <b>Madness),</b> which drew heavily {{on the work of}} Cesare Lombroso. Of particular interest even today are Panizza's discussions of hallucinations and model psychosis, hashish and the hallucinatory basis of religion.|$|E

25|$|William Henry {{also became}} a {{collector}} of books. In many later recollections Ireland described his fascination with the works and the glorious death of the forger Thomas Chatterton, and probably knew the Ossian poems of James Macpherson. He was strongly influenced by the 1780 novel Love <b>and</b> <b>Madness</b> by Herbert Croft, which was often read aloud in the Ireland house, and which contained large sections on Chatterton and Macpherson. When he was apprenticed to a mortgage lawyer, Ireland began to experiment with blank, genuinely old papers and forged signatures on them. Eventually he forged several documents until {{he was ready to}} present them to his father.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Elder Signs Press {{published}} Hive by Tim Curran.

The plot deals {{with a group of}} American explorers unearthing an Elder Things' tomb and citadel. A parallel plot also deals with an expedition using an experimental submersible to breach Lake Vostok, which is named as the location of the underwater city to which the Elder Things fled.|$|E

25|$|Another {{regional}} {{example of}} liberal {{influence can be}} found in Ecuador. As with other nations throughout the region at the time, Ecuador was steeped in conflict and uncertainty after gaining independence from Spain. By the middle of the 19th century, the country had descended into chaos <b>and</b> <b>madness,</b> with the people divided between rival liberal and conservative camps. From these conflicts, García Moreno established a conservative government that ruled the country for several years. The liberals, however, were incensed at the conservative regime and overthrew it completely in the Liberal Revolution of 1895. The Radical Liberals who toppled the conservatives were led by Eloy Alfaro, a firebrand who implemented a variety of sociopolitical reforms, including {{the separation of church and}} state, the legalization of divorce, and the establishment of public schools.|$|E
25|$|Gandalf {{arrived in}} time to help order the defences of Minas Tirith. His {{presence}} was resented by Denethor, the Steward of Gondor; but after Denethor's son Faramir was gravely wounded in battle, Denethor sank into despair <b>and</b> <b>madness.</b> Together with Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth, Gandalf led the defenders during the siege of the city. When the forces of Mordor finally broke the main gate, Gandalf alone on Shadowfax confronted the Witch-king of Angmar, Lord of the Nazgûl. But {{at that moment the}} Rohirrim arrived, compelling the Witch-king to withdraw and engage them. Gandalf would have ridden to their aid, but he too was suddenly required elsewhere—to save Faramir from Denethor, who sought in desperation to burn himself and his son on a funeral pyre in Rath Dínen.|$|E
25|$|Three oracles had {{successively}} {{operated in}} Delphi – the chthonion using egkoimisi (procedure that involved {{sleeping in the}} Holy place, so as to see a revealing dream), the Kliromanteion and finally the Apollonian, with the laurel. But ever since {{the introduction of the}} cult of Dionysus at Delphi, the god that brought his followers into ecstasy <b>and</b> <b>madness,</b> the Delphic god gave oracles through Pythia, who also fell into a trance under the influence of vapors and fumes coming from the opening, the inner sanctum of the Oracle. Pythia sat on top of a tall gilded tripod that stood above the opening. In the old days, Pythia was a virgin, young girl, but ever since Echecrates from Thessaly fell in love, kidnapped and violated a young and beautiful Pythia, a woman older than fifty years old was chosen, who dressed and wore jewelry to resemble a young maiden girl. According to tradition, Phemonoe was the first Pythia.|$|E
