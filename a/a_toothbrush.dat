5|$|The {{purpose of}} {{cleaning}} teeth {{is to remove}} plaque, which consists mostly of bacteria. Healthcare professionals recommend regular brushing twice a day (in the morning and in the evening, or after meals) {{in order to prevent}} formation of plaque and tartar. <b>A</b> <b>toothbrush</b> is able to remove most plaque, except in areas between teeth. As a result, flossing is also considered a necessity to maintain oral hygiene. When used correctly, dental floss removes plaque from between teeth and at the gum line, where periodontal disease often begins and could develop caries.|$|E

Katy helps a crocodile by brushing its teeth using <b>a</b> <b>toothbrush</b> she has salvaged, and tries to reach her clothes which have been taken by the elephant. At night, she holds a torch and explores a cave. Inside, she watches an animated drawing on the wall in which humans try to kill a tiger with fire; attempting to burn it as it grows stronger and shooting spears which it sends firing back towards them with its roar. The next morning, Katy emerges from the cave, wearing a leopard-print bikini top, a grass skirt, laced up legs and bare feet, displaying a boost of confidence and holding the spear she made earlier. She stands on top of a waterfall, overlooking the jungle, and then swings across the sky on a vine.|$|E

5|$|Tooth {{destruction}} from processes {{other than}} dental caries {{is considered a}} normal physiologic process but may become severe enough to become a pathologic condition. Attrition {{is the loss of}} tooth structure by mechanical forces from opposing teeth. Attrition initially affects the enamel and, if unchecked, may proceed to the underlying dentin. Abrasion is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from a foreign element. If this force begins at the cementoenamel junction, then progression of tooth loss can be rapid since enamel is very thin in this region of the tooth. A common source of this type of tooth wear is excessive force when using <b>a</b> <b>toothbrush.</b> Erosion is the loss of tooth structure due to chemical dissolution by acids not of bacterial origin. Signs of tooth destruction from erosion is a common characteristic in the mouths of people with bulimia since vomiting results in exposure of the teeth to gastric acids. Another important source of erosive acids are from frequent sucking of lemon juice. Abfraction is the loss of tooth structure from flexural forces. As teeth flex under pressure, the arrangement of teeth touching each other, known as occlusion, causes tension {{on one side of the}} tooth and compression on the other side of the tooth. This is believed to cause V-shaped depressions on the side under tension and C-shaped depressions on the side under compression. When tooth destruction occurs at the roots of teeth, the process is referred to as internal resorption, when caused by cells within the pulp, or external resorption, when caused by cells in the periodontal ligament.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{study and}} compare the {{microbial}} flora of dental plaque after the use of <b>a</b> self-contaminated <b>toothbrush</b> and that of <b>a</b> single-use <b>toothbrush.</b> Materials and Methods: The study group included 40 young volunteers from Yenepoya Dental College, who were free from any systemic or oral disease. In these subjects, plaque samples were collected after 1 month use of <b>a</b> self-contaminated <b>toothbrush.</b> Each subject was given a set of 30 new <b>toothbrushes</b> and <b>a</b> toothpaste tube and instructed to use one toothbrush everyday and discard it after use. The plaque samples were collected on a weekly interval and cultured on Mitis Salivarius agar. The colonies were identified and speciated and their count was recorded.

A highly significant decrease in their numbers was found after the use of <b>a</b> single-use <b>toothbrush</b> (P value 0. 001).

25|$|Modern {{toothbrush}} {{originated in}} China. The first bristle toothbrush resembling the modern one {{was found in}} China. Used during the Tang Dynasty (619–907), it consisted of hog bristles. The bristles were sourced from hogs living in Siberia and northern China because the colder temperatures provided firmer bristles. They were attached to a handle manufactured from bamboo or bone, forming <b>a</b> <b>toothbrush.</b> In 1223, Japanese Zen master Dōgen Kigen recorded on Shōbōgenzō that he saw monks in China clean their teeth with brushes made of horsetail hairs attached to an oxbone handle. The bristle toothbrush spread to Europe, brought from China to Europe by travellers. It was adopted in Europe during the 17th century. The earliest identified {{use of the word}} toothbrush in English was in the autobiography of Anthony Wood who wrote in 1690 that he had bought <b>a</b> <b>toothbrush</b> from J. Barret. Europeans found the hog bristle toothbrushes imported from China too firm and preferred softer bristle toothbrushes made from horsehair. Mass produced toothbrushes made with horse or boar bristle continued to be imported to England from China until the mid 20th century.|$|E

The improved design had a bone handle with holes bored into it for the Siberian boar hair bristles. Unfortunately, animal bristle was not an ideal material as it retained bacteria, did not desiccate efficiently and the bristles were often extricated from their intended fixed insertions. In addition to bone, handles were made of wood or ivory. In the United States, brushing teeth did not become routine until after World War II, when American soldiers had to clean their teeth daily.|$|E
25|$|Toothpaste is a paste or gel {{dentifrice}} {{used with}} <b>a</b> <b>toothbrush</b> as {{an accessory to}} clean and maintain the aesthetics and health of teeth. Toothpaste is used to promote oral hygiene: it serves as an abrasive that aids in removing the dental plaque and food from the teeth, assists in suppressing halitosis, and delivers active ingredients (most commonly fluoride) to help prevent tooth decay (dental caries) and gum disease (gingivitis). Salt and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) are among materials that can be substituted for commercial toothpaste. Toothpaste {{is not intended to}} be swallowed due to the fluoride content, but is generally not very harmful if accidentally swallowed in small amounts; however, one should seek medical attention after swallowing abnormally large amounts.|$|E

40|$|AIMS: A {{randomized}} controlled trial {{was conducted to}} evaluate the effectiveness of two oral health promotion interventions in reducing levels of plaque, gingival bleeding, and prevalence of oral yeasts among patients with stroke after three months of rehabilitation. METHODS: Patients (n= 63) with moderate to severe stroke undergoing rehabilitation were randomly allocated to receive either (1) <b>a</b> manual <b>toothbrush</b> and oral hygiene instruction (OHI) or (2) <b>a</b> powered <b>toothbrush,</b> 0. 2 % chlorhexidine gluconate mouthrinse, and OHI. Oral microbiological sampling to detect oral carriage of yeasts and clinical assessment were conducted both at baseline and at 3 months. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the percentages of sites with moderate to abundant plaque and sites with bleeding between the two groups at baseline. Among 54 patients scheduled for the 3 -month review, a total of 19 patients in group 1, and 25 patients in group 2 returned. Within group comparisons demonstrated significant reductions both in the percentages of sites with moderate to abundant plaque (p< 0. 001) and bleeding (p< 0. 001) at 3 months in the group receiving <b>a</b> powered <b>toothbrush</b> and chlorhexidine, while only a significant reduction in the percentage of sites with moderate to abundant plaque (p= 0. 001) was found for patients receiving <b>a</b> manual <b>toothbrush.</b> Reduction in the percentages of sites with moderate to abundant plaque (p= 0. 006) and bleeding (p= 0. 003) were significantly greater in the group receiving <b>a</b> powered <b>toothbrush</b> and chlorhexidine. No significant difference in the percentage of patients who harbored yeasts was observed between the two groups at 3 months. Conclusions: An intervention comprising provision of <b>a</b> powered <b>toothbrush,</b> chlorhexidine mouthrinse, and OHI is more effective in reducing dental plaque and gingival bleeding in patients undergoing rehabilitation after stroke; however, there was no significant difference in the effectiveness of the two different oral hygiene interventions on the prevalence of oral yeasts.
