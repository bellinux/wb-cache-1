40|$|Object. In a {{randomized}} controlled trial comparing surgery and prolonged conservative treatment for sciatica of 6 - 12 weeks' duration, {{more than one-third}} of patients assigned to conservative treatment underwent surgery. The objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate whether MRI at baseline could have predicted this delayed surgery. Methods. Independently evaluated qualitative and quantitative MRI findings were compared between <b>those</b> patients <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not undergo surgery during follow-up in the conservative care group. In addition, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess how well MRI parameters discriminated between <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not undergo delayed surgery (0. 5 - 0. 7 poor discrimination, ≥ 0. 7 acceptable discrimination). Results. Of 142 patients assigned to receive prolonged conservative care, 55 patients (39 %) received delayed surgery. Of the 55 surgically treated patients, 71 % had definite nerve root compression at baseline compared with 72 % of conservatively treated patients (p = 0. 76). Large disc herniations (size > 50 % of spinal canal) were nearly equally distributed between <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not undergo surgery (25 % vs 21 %, p = 0. 65). The size of the dural sac was smaller in the patients who underwent surgery (101. 2 vs 122. 9 mm 2, p = 0. 01). However, the size of the dural sac discriminated poorly between <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not undergo delayed surgery (area under ROC curve, 0. 62). Conclusions. In patients who suffered from sciatica of 6 - 12 weeks' duration, MRI at baseline did not distinguish between patients <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not undergo delayed surgery.

Slave women could be sold without their consent, expected to provide concubinage, required permission from their owner to marry; and children born to them were automatically considered Muslim under Islamic law if the father was a Muslim.|$|E

25|$|The {{opinions}} of the Talmudic rabbis are divided between those who seek {{the purpose of the}} mitzvot <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> question them. The latter argue that if the reason for each mitzvah could be determined, people might try to achieve {{what they see as the}} purpose of the mitzvah, without actually performing the mitzvah itself (lishmah), which would become self-defeating. The former believe that if people were to understand the reason and the purpose for each mitzvah, it would actually help them to observe and perform the mitzvah (some mitzvot are given reasons in the Torah).|$|E
25|$|Peter Singer (Princeton University and University of Melbourne {{professor}} and pioneer {{of the animal}} liberation movement) has long argued that, if {{it is possible to}} survive and be healthy without eating meat, fish, dairy, or eggs, one ought to choose that option instead of causing unnecessary harm to animals. In Animal Liberation, Singer argued that, because non-human animals feel, they should be treated according to utilitarian ethics. Singer's work has since been widely built upon by philosophers, both those who agree <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>not,</b> and it has been applied by animal rights advocates as well as by ethical vegetarians and vegans.|$|E
25|$|Fielding {{hoped to}} remove any moral {{ambiguity}} found within The Beggar's Opera. Unlike The Welsh Opera, the rewrite deals with morality at the very beginning. Similarly, the play focuses on problems within the literary community; the title links the play with the Grub Street Journal, a periodical that satirised inept writers that frequent Grub Street. It also links the play with Fielding's previous attacks on the London theatre and inept writers. In particular, Fielding satirises bad imitations of Gay's The Beggar's Opera <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> understand what Gay's play was originally about {{especially in regards to}} its mockery of the Italian opera tradition.|$|E

25|$|Japan's society prepares {{its people}} to work {{primarily}} {{for the good of}} the whole society rather than just the individual, and the salaryman is a part of that. Salarymen are expected to work long hours, additional overtime, to participate in after-work leisure activities such as drinking and visiting hostess bars with colleagues, and to value work over all else. The salaryman typically enters a company after graduating college and stays with that corporation his whole career. Other popular notions surrounding salarymen include karōshi, or death from overwork. In conservative Japanese culture, becoming a salaryman is the expected career choice for young men <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> take this career path are regarded as living with a stigma and less prestige. On the other hand, the word salaryman is sometimes used with derogatory connotation for his total dependence on his employer and lack of individuality.|$|E
500|$|The three Angevin kings (French for [...] "from Anjou") were Henry II, Richard I and John; [...] "Angevin" [...] {{can also}} {{refer to the}} period of history in which they reigned. Many historians {{identify}} the Angevins as a distinct English royal house. [...] "Angevin" [...] is also used in reference to any sovereign or government derived from Anjou. As a noun, it refers to any native of Anjou or an Angevin ruler, and specifically to: other counts and dukes of Anjou, including the ancestors of the three kings that formed the English royal house; their cousins, who held the crown of Jerusalem; and to unrelated members of the French royal family who were later granted the titles and formed different dynasties, such as the Capetian House of Anjou and the Valois House of Anjou. Consequently, there is disagreement between those who consider Henry III {{to be the first}} Plantagenet monarch <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> distinguish between Angevins and Plantagenets and therefore consider the first Plantagenet to be Henry II.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway {{thought he}} {{lost touch with}} American values while living in Paris, but his biographer Michael Reynolds claims the opposite, seeing {{evidence}} of the author's midwestern American values in the novel. [...] Hemingway admired hard work. He portrayed the matadors and the prostitutes, who work for a living, in a positive manner, but Brett, who prostitutes herself, is emblematic of [...] "the rotten crowd" [...] living on inherited money. It is Jake, the working journalist, who pays the bills again and again when those who can pay do not. Hemingway shows, through Jake's actions, his disapproval {{of the people who}} did not pay up. [...] Reynolds says that Hemingway shows the tragedy, not so much of the decadence of the Montparnasse crowd, but of the decline in American values of the period. As such, the author created an American hero who is impotent and powerless. Jake becomes the moral center of the story. He never considers himself part of the expatriate crowd because he is a working man; to Jake a working man is genuine and authentic, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> work for a living spend their lives posing.|$|E
