50|$|The Anti-Imperialist Cell (German: Antiimperialistische Zelle, AIZ) was {{a leftist}} militant group {{responsible}} for bombing attacks in Germany in 1995, and other killings. The group was formed believing {{itself to be}} the successor of the Red Army Faction. The cell is responsible for <b>an</b> attempted <b>bombing</b> that was foiled when police stopped their car, but when searched the explosives had vanished. Threats were made against the ruling political parties of Germany by the group. The group is responsible for <b>a</b> failed <b>bombing</b> at Free Democratic Party offices, <b>a</b> <b>bombing</b> of <b>a</b> German office in Peru, <b>a</b> <b>bombing</b> of <b>a</b> German Chancellor's home, <b>a</b> failed <b>bombing</b> of another German politician's home, and <b>a</b> <b>bombing</b> of <b>a</b> German ex-minister's home (no one was harmed). The {{two members of the}} group, Bernhard Falk and Michael Steinau, were arrested in February, 1996. After these arrests, the AIZ actions ceased.|$|R

5|$|Sabotage {{operations}} were ordered from Berlin {{in the late}} autumn of 1940, but actual work did not start until early 1941. The first {{operations were}} unsuccessful. A first attempt to smuggle <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> into Gibraltar was aborted, as the timing device was faulty. In February {{there was a large}} explosion in the North Tunnel, and in April <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> blew up near the airfield. In June 1941, however, the British intelligence foiled a new attempt, by a German agent, to attach a mine alongside an Allied cargo ship. Another attempt failed when Plazas placed <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> inside an ammunition store but was not able to bring the explosive. It was not until 1942 that the operations begun to succeed. In January 1942, two Spanish agents manage to destroy two aircraft at the North Front landing strip.|$|E

5|$|Beryllium {{was used}} by the Manhattan Project as a neutron reflector, and as a {{component}} of modulated neutron initiators. Only one firm produced it commercially in the United States, Brush Beryllium in Lorain, Ohio. The Ames Project began working on a production process in December 1943, reducing beryllium fluoride in <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> with metallic magnesium and a sulphur booster. The main difficulty with working with beryllium was its high toxicity. A closed bomb was used to minimize the possibility of producing toxic beryllium dust. The process worked, but the high temperatures and pressures created by the magnesium sulphide meant that it was potentially explosive. An alternative was then developed using beryllium fluoride in <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> with metallic calcium and a lead chloride booster. The metal was cast in a vacuum. Research was still ongoing when the war ended.|$|E
