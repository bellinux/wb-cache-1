2500|$|Bohemian-style <b>absinth</b> is also {{referred}} to as Czech-style absinthe, anise-free absinthe, or just [...] "absinth" [...] (without the [...] "e"), and is best described as a wormwood bitters. It is produced mainly in the Czech Republic, from which it gets its designation as Bohemian or Czech, although not all absinthes from the Czech Republic are Bohemian-style. Bohemian-style <b>absinth</b> typically contains little or none of the anise, fennel, and other herbal flavours associated with traditional absinthe, and thus bears very little resemblance to the absinthes made popular in the 19th century. Typical Bohemian-style <b>absinth</b> has only two similarities with its authentic, traditional counterpart: it contains wormwood and has a high alcohol content. The Czechs are credited with inventing the fire ritual in the 1990s, possibly because Czech <b>absinth</b> does not louche, which renders the traditional French preparation method useless. [...] As such, this type of absinthe and the fire ritual associated with it are entirely modern fabrications, and have little to no relationship with the historical absinthe tradition.|$|E

60|$|GABRIEL SYME was {{not merely}} a detective who pretended to be a poet; he was really a poet who had become a detective. Nor was his hatred of anarchy hypocritical. He {{was one of those}} who are driven early in life into too {{conservative}} an attitude by the bewildering folly of most revolutionists. He had not attained it by any tame tradition. His respectability was spontaneous and sudden, a rebellion against rebellion. He came of a family of cranks, in which all the oldest people had all the newest notions. One of his uncles always walked about without a hat, and another had made an unsuccessful attempt to walk about with a hat and nothing else. His father cultivated art and self-realisation; his mother went in for simplicity and hygiene. Hence the child, during his tenderer years, was wholly unacquainted with any drink between the extremes of <b>absinth</b> and cocoa, of both of which he had a healthy dislike. The more his mother preached a more than Puritan abstinence the more did his father expand into a more than pagan latitude; and by the time the former had come to enforcing vegetarianism, the latter had pretty well reached the point of defending cannibalism.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{balancing}} {{the books of}} life one must have regard to {{both sides of the}} ledger," [...] responded the Minor Poet. [...] "A crowd, I admit, of itself creates nothing; on the other hand, it receives ideals into its bosom and gives them needful shelter. It responds more readily to good than to evil. What greater stronghold of virtue than your sixpenny gallery? Your burglar, arrived fresh from jumping on his mother, finds himself applauding with the rest stirring appeals to the inborn chivalry of man. Suggestion that it was right or proper under any circumstances to jump upon one's mother he would at such moment reject with horror. 'Thinking in communities' is good for him. The hooligan, whose patriotism finds expression in squirting dirty water into the face of his coster sweetheart: the boulevardiere, primed with <b>absinth,</b> shouting 'Conspuez les Juifs!'-- the motive force stirring them in its origin was an ideal. Even into making a fool of itself, a crowd can be moved only by incitement of its finer instincts. The service of Prometheus to mankind must not be judged by the statistics of the insurance office. The world as a whole has gained by community, will attain its goal only through community. From the nomadic savage by the winding road of citizenship we have advanced far. The way winds upward still, hidden from us by the mists, but along its tortuous course lies our track into the Promised Land. Not the development of the individual--that is his own concern--but the uplifting of the race would appear to be the law. The lonely great ones, they are the shepherds of the flock--the servants, not the masters of the world. Moses shall die and be buried in the wilderness, seeing only from afar the resting-place of man's tired feet. It is unfortunate that the Ha'penny Joker and its kind should have so many readers. Maybe it teaches those to read who otherwise would never read at all. We are impatient, forgetting that the coming and going of our generations are but as the swinging of the pendulum of Nature's clock. Yesterday we booked our seats for gladiatorial shows, for the burning of Christians, our windows for Newgate hangings. Even the musical farce is an improvement upon that--at least, from the humanitarian point of view." ...|$|E

5000|$|Bohemian-style <b>absinth</b> lacks {{much of the}} herbal {{profile and}} density of {{authentic}} absinthe, including the constituents that create the louche.Since this renders Czech style <b>absinth</b> unusable for the traditional method of preparation, a modern ritual involving fire was created. In the “fire ritual,” <b>absinth</b> is poured into a glass, and a sugar cube on a slotted spoon is placed over the glass. The sugar cube is then soaked with <b>absinth</b> and is set on fire. The cube is then dropped into the <b>absinth,</b> setting it ablaze. Then water is poured over the flame until it goes out. Usually, a 1:1 ratio of water to <b>absinth</b> is used. This procedure produces a minor simulation of the louche that is seen in traditional absinthe, and the low water-to-alcohol ratio increases {{the strength of the}} resulting drink.
