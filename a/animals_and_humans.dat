5|$|The stoor worm, or Mester Stoor Worm, was a {{gigantic}} evil sea serpent of Orcadian folklore, capable of contaminating plants and destroying <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>humans</b> with its putrid breath. It is probably an Orkney {{variant of the}} Norse Jörmungandr, {{also known as the}} Midgard Serpent, or world serpent, and {{has been described as a}} sea dragon.|$|E
5|$|Topical tick {{medicines}} may be {{toxic to}} <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>humans.</b> The synthetic pyrethroid insecticide Phenothrin {{in combination with}} the hormone analogue methoprene was a popular topical flea and tick therapy for felines. Phenothrin kills adult ticks, while methoprene kills eggs. However, some products have been withdrawn, while others are known to cause adverse reactions.|$|E
5|$|The larvae of Megaselia scalaris (Phoridae) {{are almost}} {{omnivorous}} and consume such substances as paint and shoe polish. The larvae of the shore flies (Ephydridae) and some Chironomidae survive in extreme environments including glaciers (Diamesa sp., Chironomidae), hot springs, geysers, saline pools, sulphur pools, septic tanks and even crude oil (Helaeomyia petrolei). Adult hoverflies (Syrphidae) {{are well known}} for their mimicry and the larvae adopt diverse lifestyles including being inquiline scavengers inside the nests of social insects. Some brachycerans are agricultural pests, some bite <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>humans</b> and suck their blood, and some transmit diseases.|$|E

5|$|Artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Leonardo da Vinci, often {{working with}} naturalists, were also {{interested}} in the bodies of <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>humans,</b> studying physiology in detail and contributing {{to the growth of}} anatomical knowledge. The traditions of alchemy and natural magic, especially in the work of Paracelsus, also laid claim to knowledge of the living world. Alchemists subjected organic matter to chemical analysis and experimented liberally with both biological and mineral pharmacology. This {{was part of a larger}} transition in world views (the rise of the mechanical philosophy) that continued into the 17th century, as the traditional metaphor of nature as organism was replaced by the nature as machine metaphor.|$|E
5|$|Attorney Hy Mayerson was {{an early}} pioneer in Agent Orange litigation, working with {{environmental}} attorney Victor Yannacone in 1980 on the first class-action suits against wartime manufacturers of Agent Orange. In meeting Dr. Ronald A. Codario, {{one of the first}} civilian doctors to see afflicted patients, Mayerson, so impressed by the fact a physician would show so much interest in a Vietnam veteran, forwarded more than a thousand pages of information on Agent Orange and the effects of dioxin on <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>humans</b> to Codario's office the day after he was first contacted by the doctor. The corporate defendants sought to escape culpability by blaming everything on the U.S. government.|$|E
5|$|Governments are {{particularly}} concerned with zoonoses, diseases that humans may acquire from animals. Wild animal populations may harbour diseases {{that can affect}} domestic animals which may acquire them {{as a result of}} insufficient biosecurity. An outbreak of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1999 was traced back to pigs becoming ill after contact with fruit-eating flying foxes, their faeces and urine. The pigs in turn passed the infection to humans. Avian flu H5N1 is present in wild bird populations and can be carried large distances by migrating birds. This virus is easily transmissible to domestic poultry, and to humans living in close proximity with them. Other infectious diseases affecting wild animals, farm <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>humans</b> include rabies, leptospirosis, brucellosis, tuberculosis and trichinosis.|$|E

5|$|Information {{about the}} {{structure}} and function {{of the human brain}} comes from a variety of experimental methods, including <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>humans.</b> Information about brain trauma and stroke has provided information about the function of parts of the brain and the effects of brain damage. Neuroimaging is used to visualise the brain and record brain activity. Electrophysiology is used to measure, record and monitor the electrical activity of the cortex. Measurements may be of local field potentials of cortical areas, or of the activity of a single neuron. An electroencephalogram can record the electrical activity of the cortex using electrodes placed non-invasively on the scalp.|$|E
5|$|The first {{permanent}} dwellings {{were probably}} built between 3000 and 2000 BC, {{with the introduction}} of agriculture to Norway. Available evidence indicates that wood was the most used building material for these structures. Iron Age dwellings typically combined shelter for <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>humans</b> in long houses in order to preserve heat. Remains of structures from the Stone Age through the Bronze Age and the Iron Age have been excavated at Forsand in Ryfylke, near Stavanger and several other locations. Most prehistoric long houses had pairs of roof-bearing posts dividing the interior into three naves, and walls of palisades, wattle and daub or turf. Similar buildings have been excavated all over Northwestern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Scandium has no {{biological}} role, but it {{is found}} in living organisms. Once reached a human, scandium concentrates in the liver and {{is a threat to}} it; some its compounds are possibly carcinogenic, even through in general scandium is not toxic. Scandium is known to have reached the food chain, but in trace amounts only; a typical human takes in less than 0.1micrograms per day. Once released into the environment, scandium gradually accumulates in soils, which leads to increased concentrations in soil particles, <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>humans.</b> Scandium is mostly dangerous in the working environment, {{due to the fact that}} damps and gases can be inhaled with air. This can cause lung embolisms, especially during long-term exposure. The element is known to damage cell membranes of water animals, causing several negative influences on reproduction and on the functions of the nervous system.|$|E

5|$|The strongest {{clues to}} the {{function}} of the cerebellum have come from examining the consequences of damage to it. <b>Animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>humans</b> with cerebellar dysfunction show, above all, problems with motor control, {{on the same side of}} the body as the damaged part of the cerebellum. They continue to be able to generate motor activity but lose precision, producing erratic, uncoordinated, or incorrectly timed movements. A standard test of cerebellar function is to reach with the tip of the finger for a target at arm's length: A healthy person will move the fingertip in a rapid straight trajectory, whereas a person with cerebellar damage will reach slowly and erratically, with many mid-course corrections. Deficits in non-motor functions are more difficult to detect. Thus, the general conclusion reached decades ago is that the basic function of the cerebellum is to calibrate the detailed form of a movement, not to initiate movements or to decide which movements to execute.|$|E
5|$|Their {{high energy}} and drive make these dogs {{ideally suited to}} a number of {{different}} dog sports such as flyball or agility. Obedience classes are also recommended to potential owners, as Jack Russells can be stubborn at times and aggressive towards other <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>humans</b> if not properly socialized. Despite their small size, these dogs are not recommended for the condominium or apartment dweller unless the owner is ready to take on the daunting task of providing the dog with the necessary amount of exercise and stimulation. They have a tremendous amount of energy for their size, a fact which can sometimes lead to trouble involving larger animals. They may seem never to tire and will still be energetic after their owner has called it a day. While socialised members of the breed are friendly towards children, they will not tolerate abuse even if it is unintentional.|$|E
5|$|Mayerson, with Sgt. Charles E. Hartz {{as their}} {{principal}} client, filed the first US Agent Orange class-action lawsuit, in Pennsylvania in 1980, for the injuries military personnel in Vietnam suffered through exposure to toxic dioxins in the defoliant. Attorney Mayerson co-wrote the brief that certified the Agent Orange Product Liability {{action as a}} class action, the largest ever filed as of its filing. Hartz's deposition {{was one of the}} first ever taken in America, and the first for an Agent Orange trial, for the purpose of preserving testimony at trial, as it was understood that Hartz would not live to see the trial because of a brain tumor that began to develop while he was a member of Tiger Force, Special Forces, and LRRPs in Vietnam. The firm also located and supplied critical research to the Veterans' lead expert, Dr. Codario, including about 100 articles from toxicology journals dating back more than a decade, as well as data about where herbicides had been sprayed, what the effects of dioxin had been on <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>humans,</b> and every accident in factories where herbicides were produced or dioxin was a contaminant of some chemical reaction.|$|E
