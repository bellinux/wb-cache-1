500|$|Green was awoken {{some time}} after midnight {{by the sound of}} the home's {{built-in}} fire alarm system. She initially assumed that the sound was a false alarm caused by her dogs triggering the burglar alarm, but when she tried to shut off the alarm at the control panel in her bedroom and it continued sounding, she opened her bedroom door and found smoke in the hallway. She exited the house using a deck that connected to her first-floor bedroom. While standing on the deck, she heard her son Tim on the home's intercom system, calling to <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> he should do. [...] "He used to be my thirteen-year-old", Green explained to police, and said that she had told him to stay in the house and wait for firefighters to rescue him. She had then knocked on a neighbor's door to ask them to call 9-1-1. When she returned to the house, she found Kate, who had climbed through her second-floor bedroom window, {{on the roof of the}} home's garage. Green called to Kate to jump, and Kate landed safely on the ground in front of Green.|$|E
500|$|Daniels {{was unsure}} {{as to what}} to call the Christmas exchange. He had heard the names [...] "Nasty Christmas", [...] "White Elephant", and [...] "Yankee Swap" [...] used to {{describe}} the game, and so he wrote all three into the script in order [...] "to cover all regions of the country". Schur created a list of who receives what gift in order to preserve continuity in the episode. Gifts featured in the episode include Toby giving Angela a baby poster, Kelly getting Oscar a shower radio, Michael buying Ryan an iPod, Kevin buying a foot bath for himself, Creed giving Jim an old shirt, Oscar buying Creed a keychain, and Jim purchasing Pam a teapot. The teapot was chosen because it needed to fit other gifts inside of it, as well as be something that Dwight could have a use for later on in the episode. Fischer was allowed to pick the color of the teapot featured in the episode. She picked teal, due to it being her then-husband James Gunn's favorite color. Jenna Fischer recalled that fans always <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> Jim wrote in Pam's note. Fischer noted that John Krasinski wrote the note himself and that the contents are [...] "a secret". Jim finally gives Pam the note in the penultimate ninth season episode [...] "A.A.R.M." ...|$|E
2500|$|HE summons Q'nqüra to <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> {{she wants}} from Jupiter, Horus and Ch'ih-yu. She tells HE, [...] "Nothing. We don't want men rampaging around like naughty {{children}} {{just because they}} can't have their way. After all, it's your world they would destroy." [...] Her plan is for the [...] "Amazons to release the men and become their willing servants. Through servitude, we will gain complete control, and the men will be none-the-wiser." [...] Impressed with this idea, HE decides to make Q'nqüra HIS private messenger, to which she replies, [...] "I will be your humble servant," [...] with Helios commenting [...] "In that moment, Q'nqüra, too, had won." ...|$|E
60|$|Her godmother, who saw her all in tears, <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> was the matter.|$|R
60|$|I made no answer, but {{turning to}} Pomona, I <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> this all meant.|$|R
60|$|Ovid {{informed}} {{his mother}} of Benjulia's suggestion, and <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> {{she thought of}} it.|$|R
60|$|I was so {{astonished}} that I {{could scarcely}} <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> she meant.|$|E
60|$|ZOO. You {{have been}} told not to do it. <b>Ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> you want to know; and be quick about it.|$|E
60|$|He did {{not need}} to <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> she meant. At once he {{perceived}} how she had misread the scene she had witnessed.|$|E
60|$|Not {{wishing to}} pursue this subject, I <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>her</b> father was doing with the metal plates.|$|R
60|$|Then they <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> she {{was doing}} {{in the depths of}} winter in her thin dress.|$|R
5000|$|In the present, as Garnet {{finishes}} <b>her</b> story, Steven <b>asks</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> {{the answer}} was. She tells him: [...] "Love".|$|R
60|$|Anson {{was about}} to <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> the trouble was with his girl, when she turned away. She could not be dangerously ill; anyway, there was comfort in that.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was moved}} to <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> she would do about Africa. [...] "Leave it to Lord Robert!" [...] she said, leaning forward impressively. [...] "Leave {{it to the people}} who know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Agatha's tired," [...] Mrs. Farnam broke in. [...] "She needs a {{rest and}} I'm {{going to get}} her some food. You can <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> you like when I bring her back." ...|$|E
60|$|CONRAD. I {{sent her}} my last book. I can {{break the ice}} by <b>asking</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> she made of it.|$|R
60|$|Even {{then she}} was not satisfied, and was still grumbling and muttering, so they <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> was the matter.|$|R
6000|$|Amy smiled, and <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> was the matter? She replied short, she did {{not know}} where she was, nor where she was going to carry her, and she would go no farther; and without any more ceremony, turns back, and walks apace away from her. Amy owned she was surprised, and came back too, and called to her, upon which the girl stopped, and Amy coming up to <b>her,</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> she meant? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On {{the other}} hand," [...] {{continued}} Forester, [...] "she might ask for silk stockings, {{and if the}} shopkeeper were to <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> color she wanted, she might say black. In that sense, black would be a color." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose it}} would be the least use to ask you not to show this letter to Mrs. Burton, and I won't, but if you do, I wish you would <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> she thinks it means, and whether it's fate, or foreordination, or what." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish it," [...] she said, {{speaking}} low. And it pleased {{her that}} he made no answer but to <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> he should sing. He had a light tenor voice. It was wobbly at first, but improved as he went on. They ended with a duet.|$|E
5000|$|Lily is {{practicing}} {{still with}} now just Jackson, who comments on her band's music, {{saying that they}} are too [...] "pop" [...] for her. She kisses him after he <b>asks</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>her</b> heart is telling her to do.|$|R
50|$|The song {{is cited}} in the movie True Romance by the {{character}} of Alabama when Clarence <b>asks</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> music she likes.|$|R
60|$|Then {{they went}} away, leaving the Queen very sad, so sad that the King noticed it, and <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> was the matter.|$|R
60|$|But it was Maqueda {{who first}} gave me any {{definite}} hope. On the third evening she came and sat by Orme for awhile, her attendants {{standing at a}} little distance. When she left him {{there was a new}} look upon her face--a very joyful look--which caused me to <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> had happened.|$|E
6000|$|On which, {{while she}} stood there as if all handsomely and deferentially {{waiting for him to}} {{consider}} and decide, he would have been naturally moved to <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> she committed herself then to--so moved, that is, if he hadn't, before saying it, thought more sharply still of something better. [...] "Oh, that's another thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And a {{very good}} plan too," [...] said Marian, laughing; [...] "but I am afraid poor Selina cannot be in such good hands. See, here are the impertinent people writing verses about her, {{as if they had}} any {{business}} to <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> she is thinking about. Listen, Gerald; did you ever hear such stuff?" ...|$|E
60|$|And then by way {{of putting}} her on the {{defensive}} he <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> she thought {{a man in his}} position ought to do.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, she's amazing--she's amazing," [...] I repeated; [...] "but so are you." [...] And then I <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> she {{had said}} to my boy.|$|R
60|$|Hilda {{was greatly}} {{interested}} in this rich portfolio. She lingered so long over one particular sketch, that Miriam <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> discovery she had made.|$|R
6000|$|Jacinta {{looked at}} him reflectively over her fan. [...] "I {{scarcely}} supposed you would understand, and one does not always feel {{in the mood to}} undertake a logical exposition of their views. Still, here's Muriel, and she, at least, generally seems to know just what she means. Suppose you <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> she thinks of dancing." ...|$|E
6000|$|Bartley did not <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> {{her letter}} {{was when she}} demanded a stamp of him on his return; but he knew. He inquired of Mrs. Nash where these cheap eating-houses were to be found, and he posted the letter in the first box they came to, merely saying, [...] "I hope you haven't been asking any favors, Marsh?" ...|$|E
60|$|TANNER. You lie, Tavy: you are. So let's {{have her}} {{down from the}} drawing-room and <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> she intends us to do. Off with you, Tavy, and fetch her. [Tavy turns to go]. And don't be long for the {{strained}} relations between myself and Ramsden will make the interval rather painful [Ramsden compresses his lips, but says nothing--].|$|E
50|$|But then, he was {{confused}} when Nene started yelling in pain over the phone. He <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> was happening. Nene {{was about to}} give birth.|$|R
60|$|When {{the general}} stampede {{occurred}} Winterborne {{had also been}} looking on, and encountering one of the girls, had <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> caused them all to fly.|$|R
50|$|John {{tries to}} talk with Elena and tells her that he knows she knows. When he <b>asks</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>her</b> mother would think of all these, Elena makes him {{understand}} that she knows her birth mother is Isobel who is a vampire herself and she leaves.|$|R
