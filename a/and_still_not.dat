5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of Narcissus is complex, <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> fully resolved. Known to the ancients, the genus name appears in Graeco-Roman literature, although their interest {{was as much}} medicinal as botanical. It is unclear which species the ancients were familiar with. Although frequently mentioned in Mediaeval and Renaisance texts it was not formally described till the work of Linnaeus in 1753. By 1789 it had been grouped into a family (Narcissi) but shortly thereafter this was renamed Amaryllideae, from which comes the modern placement within Amaryllidaceae, although {{for a while it}} was considered part of Liliaceae.|$|E

25|$|Bastion Properties was {{in trouble}} because of {{building}} costs and an unsatisfactory building manager. After rapid expansion, Heseltine's businesses were badly hit by the Selwyn Lloyd financial squeeze of 1961 <b>and,</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> yet thirty years old, he would eventually owe £250,000 (around £4.5 million at 2016 prices). He claims to have been lent a badly needed £85,000 in December 1962 by a bank manager who retired the same day. Later, during the 1990s, Heseltine joked about how he had avoided bankruptcy by such stratagems as paying bills only when threatened with legal action, although he eventually settled all his debts. It was during this stressful period of his life that he took up gardening as a serious hobby.|$|E

25|$|Initially {{there were}} four icon players {{designated}} by the Indian Premier League organizing committee: Sachin Tendulkar for Mumbai Indians, Sourav Ganguly for Kolkata Knight Riders, Rahul Dravid for Royal Challengers Bangalore, and Yuvraj Singh for Kings XI Punjab. Later, on the request of Delhi Daredevils, Virender Sehwag's name {{was added to the}} list. Deccan Chargers also asked for Icon Player status to be given to VVS Laxman, but he declined the offer in order to allow the franchise to spend more money on other players <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> breach the US$5 million salary cap. The purpose behind designating the icon players is to ensure that top draw players will represent their respective city sides, which is important for the league to increase fan support and interest among the locals.|$|E
25|$|Djokovic {{collected}} his 60th career {{title in}} Doha, defeating Nadal in two sets {{in a final}} that lasted 73 minutes. He broke his own ATP ranking points record, bringing it up to 16,790. Djokovic then proceeded to win his sixth Australian Open. On his road to his Open Era record sixth title in Melbourne, he defeated Roger Federer in four sets in the semi-finals, and in a rematch of the 2015 final, he defeated Andy Murray, in three straight sets. He quickly rebounded from an eye infection at the Dubai open to collect a fifth Indian Wells Masters title, defeating Rafael Nadal in the semi-finals, and Milos Raonic in the final. Djokovic's dominant run resulted in a situation, where Nos. 2 and 3 (Andy Murray and Roger Federer) could combine their points <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> have enough to pass Djokovic.|$|E
500|$|Like {{previous}} performers, Madonna was {{not paid}} for the show. According to Zack O'Malley Greenburg of Forbes, [...] "Typically, the entertainers for the Super Bowl do not get a cash payment ... This {{is the kind of}} exposure that entertainers would give their right arm for; they could do 20 Leno and Letterman appearances <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> reach that [...] audience". Greenburg wrote that with 30-second commercial spots commanding over $3 million apiece, the 12 minutes of free television exposure had a total value of $84 million for Madonna's enterprises and the singer did not have to pay for accommodations, travel, backup dancers, stage setup, advertising and publicity: [...] "Given all these benefits, playing the Super Bowl halftime show for free is more than worth the trouble. In fact, it's incredibly lucrative– and such a good deal for artists that some suspect a major change might be on the horizon".|$|E

500|$|Sopronova pečatnja, or Sopron's Printing House, {{was officially}} opened on [...] The Cyrillic orthography {{that was used}} in it was {{consistently}} in accordance with the linguistic reform of Serbian philologist Vuk Karadžić, which was at that time relatively new <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> universally accepted. The first issue of a political-informative and educational weekly newspaper named Bosanski vjestnik ( [...] , [...] "Bosnian Herald") appeared on the same day. This was the first newspaper ever to be published in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Sopron made a deal with the vilayet's authorities to publish it independently from the official gazette. When Sopron presented the editorial policy of his newspaper to the authorities, he indicated that it would be printed in the Serbian language, much to the Ottomans' displeasure. The authorities subsequently scratched [...] "Serbian" [...] and replaced it with [...] "Bosnian". Sopron accepted the revision and went along with Osman Pasha's idea of promoting a unitary Bosnian nation. Nevertheless, Bosanski vjestnik had [...] "a decidedly Serb orientation". Sopron did not consider this contradictory, as he apparently identified Bosnian-ness with Serbness. In the newspaper, the language was occasionally referred to as Serbo-Bosnian, while both the Serb and the Croat ethnic designations were expressed.|$|E
500|$|Alexis Petridis from The Guardian {{listed the}} song as the weakest effort on MDNA, adding that [...] "its {{position}} as the album's lead single {{seems to have had}} more to do with showing off the presence of Nicki Minaj and M.I.A. than its featherweight melody." [...] A writer for Virgin Media gave the song three out of five stars, writing: [...] "Like most Madonna singles, it skips along at a furious pace with a gleam in its eye, but the self-references get tiresome and ultimately she is just trying too hard." [...] Nick Levine, writing for The National, relegated the track as a [...] "lighter pop morsel". Matthew Parpetua from Pitchfork Media panned the song, saying that Solveig's production on the track was paired with equally [...] "bland lyrics". Brad O'Mancey from Popjustice declared that the track was [...] "proof that sometimes you can listen to something many, many times <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> have any idea whether it's any good or not." [...] Chicago Tribune journalist Greg Kot was disappointed with the song and its lyrics, which he found to be meaningless, while Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald relegated it as [...] "trite and disposable". Alex Macpherson from Fact found the song to be [...] "sheer misconceived awfulness".|$|E
500|$|Hoffman {{explained}} {{the key to}} his changeup was how he pinched the seam of the ball with his thumb and index finger as he released it. He threw the changeup with the arm speed used to throw a fastball, and the spin and movement of the ball looked the same to the batter. His changeup ranged from 73–76mph. Bruce Bochy, who managed Hoffman for over a decade with the Padres, said of Hoffman's changeup: [...] "He pitched so well off his fastball [...] couldn't just sit on it every pitch." [...] "You could be sitting on [...] <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> be successful with it", says former player Mark Sweeney. It was the arm action on the change up and the late sink just before it reached the plate that allowed Hoffman to stay successful over the years. With opponents flailing to slow down their swings, teammates nicknamed Hoffman's changeup The Bugs Bunny Pitch after a famous Bugs Bunny cartoon episode. [...] "Some [...] fool you. Some guys overpower you. Hoffman embarrasses you", said former rival and later teammate Mike Piazza. After striking out on a changeup to end the game against Hoffman, Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca said, [...] "It's like it has a parachute on it." [...] As Hoffman lost velocity on his fastball throughout his career, he compensated by maintaining a notable speed differential between that pitch and his changeup. He initially kept the grip of his changeup a secret. [...] "I was a little weird about it", Hoffman said. [...] "I didn't like talking about how I threw the change. I didn't want people to see how I gripped the ball. I thought I'd be giving away something to the hitters." [...] Later in his career, he posed for pictures of his grip, figuring everyone had seen it.|$|E

2500|$|Being a {{disorder}} defined relatively recently <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> completely understood, fibromyalgia {{continues to be}} a diagnosis that sometimes is disputed. Dr. Frederick Wolfe, lead author of the 1990 paper that first defined the diagnostic guidelines for fibromyalgia, stated in 2008, that he believed it [...] "clearly" [...] not to be a disease but instead a physical response to depression and stress, and in 2013 that its causes [...] "are controversial in a sense" [...] and [...] "there are many factors that produce these symptoms – some are psychological and some are physical and it does exist on a continuum".|$|E
2500|$|When {{looked at}} philosophically, qualia become {{a tipping point}} between {{physical}}ity and the metaphysical, which polarizes the discussion, as we've seen above, into [...] "Do they or do they not exist?"

[...] However, from a strictly neurological perspective, they can both exist, and be {{very important to the}} organism's survival, and be the result of strict neuronal oscillation, <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> rule out the metaphysical. A good example of this pro/con blending is in Rodolfo Llinás's I of the Vortex (MIT Press, 2002, pp.202–207). Llinás argues that qualia are ancient and necessary for an organism's survival and a product of neuronal oscillation. Llinás gives the evidence of anesthesia of the brain and subsequent stimulation of limbs to demonstrate that qualia can be [...] "turned off" [...] with changing only the variable of neuronal oscillation (local brain electrical activity), while all other connections remain intact, arguing strongly for an oscillatory—electrical origin of qualia, or important aspects of them.|$|E
2500|$|The whole {{project has}} been the subject of much {{controversy}} from the beginning, <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> everyone applauds how the district was commercialised and replanned. For example, the decision by the Berlin Senate to divide the land between just four investors, when numerous others had submitted bids, had raised many eyebrows. Additionally the remarkably low price for which Daimler-Benz had been allowed to secure their plot had prompted questions from the Berlin Auditor-General's office and the European Union in Brussels, after which Daimler-Benz were billed for an additional sum. There were wrangles over land-usage: although a central feature of the Daimler-Benz development is a top shopping mall - the Arkaden (Arcades), this did not form part of the plans until the Berlin Senate belatedly insisted that a shopping mall be included, and the plans were altered accordingly. Despite its undoubted success, this in turn led to what many saw as an [...] "Americanisation" [...] of the area, with even its private security force kitted out in something resembling New York Police uniforms.|$|E
