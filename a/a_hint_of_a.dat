40|$|Abstract. Detections of diffuse inverse Compton (IC) {{emission}} at hard X-ray energies {{have typically}} been controversial and/or of low significance. Consistency {{of the existing}} limits and detections may be possible only for very extended IC spatial distributions. To test this idea, we apply a method to characterize extended, hard X-ray emission from the Swift BAT survey. Spatially coincident spectra from XMM-Newton and Swift are jointly fit to simulta-neously constrain both thermal and non-thermal components, but no significant IC spectral component is seen {{in any of the}} clusters in the sample. For the Coma cluster, our upper limits exclude the most recently detected fluxes, regardless of the IC spatial distribution. Spectra from all clusters are summed, to enhance marginal IC emission possibly present in many clusters, but no aggregate non-thermal excess is found, although <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> excess is seen in the radio halo/relic subset...|$|R
