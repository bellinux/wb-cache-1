5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} {{should be}} suspected {{if any of}} the symptoms associated with the condition occurs following a drop in pressure, in particular, within 24 hours of diving. In 1995, 95% of all cases reported to Divers Alert Network had shown symptoms within 24 hours. An alternative diagnosis should be suspected if severe symptoms begin more than six hours following decompression without an altitude exposure or if any symptom occurs more than 24 hours after surfacing. The diagnosis is confirmed if the symptoms are relieved by recompression. Although MRI or CT can frequently identify bubbles in DCS, they are not <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> determining the diagnosis as a proper history of the event and description of the symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Scientists have {{suggested}} that the unique skull shape of Majungasaurus and other abelisaurids indicate different predatory habits than other theropods. Whereas most theropods were characterized by long, low skulls of narrow width, abelisaurid skulls were taller and wider, and often shorter in length as well. The narrow skulls of other theropods were well equipped to withstand the vertical stress of a powerful bite, but not <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> withstanding torsion (twisting). In comparison to modern mammalian predators, most theropods may have used a strategy similar in some ways to that of long- and narrow-snouted canids, with the delivery of many bites weakening the prey animal.|$|E

25|$|For {{patients}} treated for stage I seminoma who choose surveillance rather than undergoing adjuvant therapy, {{there have been}} no randomized trials to determine the optimum frequency of scans and visits, and the schedules vary very widely across the world, and within individual countries. In the UK there is an ongoing clinical trial called TRISST. This is assessing how often scans should take place and whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used instead of CT scans. MRI is being investigated because it does not expose the patient to radiation and so, if it is shown to be <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> detecting relapses, it may be preferable to CT.|$|E
25|$|Worrell did, however, {{serve as}} the team manager when West Indies hosted Australia in 1964–65. The matches against Australia were bitterly fought, with accusations about Charlie Griffith's action (he was accused of throwing, which is banned in the laws of cricket) and bouncer wars. The West Indies won this series 2–1 to be the {{unofficial}} world champions. Sobers was not <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> man-management as Worrell and cracks soon began to appear. Often it was his individual brilliance that made {{the difference between a}} win and a loss. Throughout the 1960s, West Indies bowling was led by Wes Hall, Griffith, Lance Gibbs and Sobers himself. Hall and Griffith faded and then retired {{by the end of the}} decade, but WI could find no replacement for them till the mid-1970s.|$|E
25|$|MPEG-2 doubles {{the number}} of {{sampling}} rates which are supported and MPEG-2.5 adds 3 more. When this was written, the suggested implementations were quite dated. Implementers of the standard were supposed to devise their own algorithms suitable for removing parts of {{the information from the}} audio input. As a result, many different MP3 encoders became available, each producing files of differing quality. Comparisons were widely available, so it was easy for a prospective user of an encoder to research the best choice. Some encoders that were proficient at encoding at higher bit rates (such as LAME) were not necessarily <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> lower bit rates. Over time, LAME evolved on the SourceForge website until it became the de facto CBR MP3 encoder. Later an ABR mode was added. Work progressed on true variable bit rate using a quality goal between 0 and 10. Eventually numbers (such as -V 9.600) could generate excellent quality low bit rate voice encoding at only 41kbit/s using the MPEG-2.5 extensions.|$|E

500|$|For {{the rest}} of 1863, the {{regiment}} spent most of its time drilling and scouting. General Henry Halleck noted in 1863 that the entire Union force in western Virginia/West Virginia was [...] "...too small to attempt any campaign by itself" [...] and [...] "acted merely on the defensive in repelling raids and breaking up guerrilla bands." [...] During August, Brigadier General Alfred N. Duffié, a veteran of European wars, became the commander of all cavalry in the Kanawha Valley. His headquarters, and the regiment, was located in Charleston. The regiment's CompanyH was trained to be Duffié's bodyguards. Duffié was an excellent drillmaster, and his drills helped prepare the regiment for future fighting in the Shenandoah Valley. He was not <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> fighting as he was at training. He was eventually transferred, and later captured.|$|E
500|$|Douglas Robert Jardine ( [...] 1900– [...] 1958) was a cricketer {{who played}} 22 Test matches for England, captaining the side in 15 of those matches between 1931 and 1934. A {{right-handed}} batsman, {{he is best}} known for captaining the English team during the 1932–33 Ashes tour of Australia. During that series, England employed [...] "Bodyline" [...] tactics against the Australian batsmen, wherein bowlers pitched the ball short on the line of leg stump to rise towards the bodies of the batsmen in a manner that most contemporary players and critics viewed as intimidatory and physically dangerous. Jardine is generally believed to be the person responsible for the implementation of Bodyline. A controversial figure among cricketers, he was well known for his dislike of Australian players and crowds and was unpopular in Australia, particularly for his manner and especially after the Bodyline tour. Many who played under his leadership regarded him as an excellent captain; not all regarded him <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> managing people. He was also famous in cricket circles for wearing a multi-coloured Harlequin cap.|$|E
500|$|However, {{many other}} types of animals {{have been shown to}} have the ability for object {{permanence}}. These include dogs, cats, and a few species of birds such as the carrion crow, Eurasian jays and food-storing magpies. [...] Dogs are able to reach a level of object permanence that allows them to find food after it has been hidden beneath one of two cups and rotated 90°. [...] Similarly, cats are able to understand object permanence but not to the same extent that dogs can. Cats fail to understand that if they see something go into an apparatus in one direction that it will still be there if the cat tries to enter from another direction. However, while cats {{did not seem to be}} quite <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> this ‘invisible displacement test’ as dogs are, it’s hard to say whether their poorer performance is a true reflection of their abilities or just due to the way in which they’ve been tested. A longitudinal study found that carrion crows' ability developed gradually, albeit with slight changes in the order of mastery compared to human infants. There was only one task, task 15, that the crows were not able to master. The crows showed perseverative searches at a previously rewarded location (the so-called ‘A-not-B error’). They mastered visible rotational displacements consistently, but failed at more complex invisible rotational displacements. [...] Another study tested the comparison of how long it took food-storing magpies to develop the object permanence necessary for them to be able to live independently. [...] The research suggests that these magpies followed a very similar pattern as human infants while they were developing.|$|E

500|$|Seili has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Most of the reviewers have been {{appreciative of the}} vocals and the successful combination of synthpop and darker ballads, but more or less critical with the notable contrast between the thumping pop song [...] "Nettiin" [...] {{and the rest of}} the album and Vartiainen's lack of peculiarity. Teemu Fiilin of the magazine Rumba gave Seili three out of five stars, saying that [...] "Seili follows pretty much the schlager-ish pattern of a poet girl's inflated electro-pop". He complimented [...] "En haluu kuolla tänä yönä" [...] as [...] "a brilliant pop song, suitable to be sung by a [...] 27-year-old Jenni Vartiainen who is enjoying her life". Due to the accompaniment of the more poetical, dramatical and mature songs written by Mariska, Fiilin considered [...] "Nettiin" [...] "a really epic fail" [...] that [...] "would be a lot of fun if performed by Tea Hiilloste on Kids Top 20". He thought [...] "Duran Duran" [...] is also brilliant, but considered Vartiainen to be more talented with faster songs, because she, when singing melancholic songs, [...] "lags kilometers behind [...] Chisu". The pop rock magazine Stara said the album is not <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> first hearing as Vartiainen's debut Ihmisten edessä, but it gave the album four out five stars. The magazine complimented the aggregate of [...] "En haluu kuolla tänä yönä" [...] and the beauty and elegance of [...] "Duran Duran". Stara was less harsh on reviewing the inclusion of [...] "Nettiin", saying the Western-themed sounds seem a bit odd, but that the song is good in its entirety.|$|E
