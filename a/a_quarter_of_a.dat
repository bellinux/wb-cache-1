More than <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> million people of diverse ethnicities {{attended}} the event, sprawling from {{the steps of}} the Lincoln Memorial onto the National Mall and around the reflecting pool. At the time, it was the largest gathering of protesters in Washington, D.C.'s history.|$|E

5|$|Gilbert was knighted on 15 July 1907 in {{recognition}} of his contributions to drama. Sullivan had been knighted for his contributions to music almost <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> century earlier, in 1883. Gilbert was, however, the first British writer ever to receive a knighthood for his plays alone—earlier dramatist knights, such as Sir William Davenant and Sir John Vanbrugh, were knighted for political and other services.|$|E
5|$|Ideas {{about the}} nature of law in general were {{beginning}} to change. In 1716, the Septennial Act was passed, which had a number of consequences. First, it showed that Parliament no longer considered its previous statutes unassailable, as it provided for a maximum parliamentary term of seven years, whereas the Triennial Act (1694) (enacted less than <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> century previously) had provided for a maximum term of three years.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} Roman rule in Britain, {{the region}} now known as East Anglia was settled by a North Germanic group known as the Angles, {{although}} {{there is evidence of}} early settlement of the region by a minority of other peoples, for instance the Swabians, who settled in the area around the modern town of Swaffham. By 600, a number of kingdoms had begun to form in the territories of southern Britain conquered by the Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians. The ruling dynasty of East Anglia was the Wuffingas, named from Wuffa, an early king. The first king known to have ruled is Rædwald, whose reign spanned <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> century from about 599.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's European Cup defeat to Benfica in October 1991 is {{regarded}} as a watershed moment in Graham's managerial career. He altered his tactics and built a stubborn team, which lacked the creativity associated with the first half of his Arsenal reign. Graham's Arsenal struggled to put together a title challenge in the newly-formed Premier League, but were cup specialists in the early half of the nineties. In 1992–93, Graham became the first manager to win the FA Cup and League Cup in the same season. A season later, he guided Arsenal to their first European trophy for almost <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> century, as the team won the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Tarrare {{had a huge}} {{appetite}} and by his teens could eat <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bullock, weighing as much as Tarrare himself, in a single day. By this time, his parents could not provide for him and had forced him to leave home. For some years after this, he toured {{the country with a}} roaming band of thieves and prostitutes, begging and stealing for food, before gaining employment as a warm-up act to a travelling charlatan. Tarrare would draw a crowd by eating corks, stones and live animals, and by swallowing an entire basketful of apples one after the other. He would eat ravenously and was particularly fond of snake meat.|$|E

5|$|At the 3 March 1962 election, Askin led the Coalition {{to another}} defeat to the Labor Party, now under Bob Heffron, {{who had become}} Premier {{following}} Cahill's death in October 1959. Morton retained his seat again with 80.76%. Heffron was Premier until his retirement on 30 April 1964. He was succeeded by Jack Renshaw, whose tenure was {{perceived to be the}} last days of a party which, after almost <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> century in government, was tired. At the May 1965 election, Askin led the Coalition to its first ever state electoral victory, gaining eight seats and a swing of 5.6% to achieve a majority of two. Askin became the first Liberal Premier. Morton was re-elected with 82.30%.|$|E
5|$|At the Dutch Grand Prix, Rindt {{eventually}} {{used the}} new Lotus 72, better sorted after alterations had been made. He set pole {{position in the}} final practice session, almost <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second ahead of his closest challenger, Stewart. Rindt went on to take his maiden victory in the Lotus 72, {{but it was not}} a joyful occasion for him; on lap 23, his close friend Piers Courage, with whom he had eaten dinner just the night before, died in a fiery crash. Rindt was heavily shaken by the loss of yet another fellow driver and contemplated retirement.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} peace was {{completely}} restored in the city, {{the cost to}} the state for suppression of the mob was between $80,000 and $85,000. Later that year, the B agreed to a number of reforms: crewmen would not be called to work more than an hour before a train's departure, crews were to be paid <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> day's pay if the train they were working was canceled, and passes were to be given for men working who had long layovers. In 1880, the B Employees Relief Association was established.|$|E

5|$|Coldrum Long Barrow is {{comparatively}} {{isolated from}} the other Medway Megaliths; in this it is unique, given that the other surviving examples are clustered into two groups. It is possible that another chambered tomb was located nearby; a razed, elongated earthen mound with an east–west orientation {{is located in a}} hollow {{at the foot of the}} downs just under <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mile north of the Coldrum Stones. It may be that this represents the remnants of another such monument which has had its stones removed or buried. Several large sarsens south of the Coldrums might represent the remnants of a further such tomb, since destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In a {{literary}} career that spanned more than <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> century, Trimmer authored somewhere between 33 and 44 texts. She {{wrote in a}} wide range of genres: textbooks, teaching manuals, children's literature, political pamphlets and critical periodicals. While many of her texts were for children, some of her works, such as The Œconomy of Charity, were also for specific adult audiences. Still others were written for both children and adults, such as The Servant’s Friend (1786–7), which was meant to instruct servants of all ages.|$|E

Hülkenberg was third for Force India ahead of Ricciardo and Vettel. The session saw several incidents: Bottas damaged {{the floor of his}} car when he ran over a drain cover on his installation lap and was forced to miss the rest of the session; Felipe Massa made contact with the wall, but was later able to rejoin practice; Räikkönen's track time was limited as well due to a loss of power; and a red flag period occurred right after the chequered flag fell as Pérez crashed at turn 15.|$|E
