5|$|News that Marc Anthony was {{recording}} an English-language album {{began in}} 1996 when RMM executive Ralph Mercado mentioned the possibility following a joint-venture between RMM (Anthony's former record label) and MCA Records. <b>Anthony</b> <b>said</b> {{that he would}} not record in English until he felt he was ready to do so. After the release of his third studio album Contra la Corriente in 1997, disputes over business practices arose between him and Mercado. Anthony suspected that he was not receiving full payment from his record label for his recordings. Mercado would not allow Anthony to leave the record label because his contract committed Anthony to record four more albums for RMM.|$|E

500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{reviewed}} the episode, simply saying he [...] "loved this episode," [...] {{giving it a}} perfect 10 out of 10 score.

[...] Meredith Blake, a contributor from the Los Angeles Times opined, [...] "To all those haters who say 30 Rock is losing its touch, I say 'poppycock!' [...] was proof that the show is as zippy as ever." [...] She noted that Jack's plot [...] "didn't make {{a whole lot of}} sense", nonetheless [...] "anything that means more Will Arnett on 30 Rock is fine by me." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad reported it was great to see Jack and NBC [...] "still being affected by the economy, government bailouts, and Washington hearings". Sassone much preferred [...] "Into the Crevasse" [...] than [...] "Season 4". New York magazine contributor Mark Graham said this episode of 30 Rock saw the series [...] "once again hitting a familiar, meta-flavored stride, as Tina Fey and her writing staff tried a 'ripped from the headlines' approach and took on recent real-life story lines like the 30 Rock porno". [...] "The return of Will Arnett, the existence of a Porn Liz, and one deal breaker after another: 'Into the Crevasse' had some killer lines, even if it didn't come together in one big narrative", remarked Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly.

2500|$|When Anthony {{tried to}} speak at the New York State Teachers' Association meeting in 1853, her attempt sparked a half-hour debate among the men about whether it was proper for women to speak in public. Finally allowed to continue, <b>Anthony</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Do you not see that so long as society says a woman is incompetent to be a lawyer, minister, or doctor, but has ample ability to be a teacher, that every man of you who chooses this {{profession}} tacitly acknowledges that he has no more brains than a woman." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anthony {{expressed}} {{a vision of}} a racially integrated society that was radical for a time when abolitionists were debating the question of what was to become of the slaves after they were freed, and when people like Abraham Lincoln were calling for African Americans to be shipped to newly established colonies in Africa.
