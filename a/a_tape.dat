5|$|All stories {{starring}} Jon Pertwee as the Third Doctor are complete, {{though many}} episodes no longer survive on their original videotapes and were only available from black-and-white overseas prints upon recovery; these episodes have subsequently been restored to colour {{using a variety}} of methods. In order of original transmissions, the very last Doctor Who master videotapes to be wiped were the first episodes of the 1974 serials Invasion of the Dinosaurs and Death to the Daleks. The latter was recovered from overseas, initially from <b>a</b> <b>tape</b> in the NTSC format, and later in the original PAL format on <b>a</b> <b>tape</b> returned from Dubai.|$|E

5|$|Although the Mellotron was {{designed}} to reproduce {{the sound of the}} original instrument, replaying <b>a</b> <b>tape</b> creates minor fluctuations in pitch (wow and flutter), and amplitude, so a note sounds slightly different each time it is played. Pressing a key harder allows the head to come into contact under greater pressure, {{to the extent that the}} Mellotron responds to aftertouch.|$|E
5|$|Although the ZX Microdrive was {{initially}} greeted with good reviews, it never took {{off as a}} distribution method due to worries {{about the quality of}} the cartridges and piracy.

5|$|The band {{continued}} to tour as a duo, with Linnell playing accordion and Flansburgh on guitars, or occasionally playing a marching band bass drum.

5|$|A similar {{initiative}} {{came from}} Norman Pierre Gentieu (1914–2009), an American writer who discovered Sorabji by reading his book Around Music {{just after the}} Second World War. Because of the post-war shortages in England, Gentieu sent Sorabji some provisions, {{and the depth of}} their friendship appears to have been such that he continued to do so for the next four decades. In the early 1950s Gentieu made an offer to Sorabji to pay for the microfilming of his major piano works and to give some copies to selected libraries. All of his unpublished musical manuscripts were eventually microfilmed. Gentieu also sent Sorabji <b>a</b> <b>tape</b> recorder to record some of his music, but Sorabji did not do so.|$|E
5|$|Blitz {{conceived}} a rough storyline for {{the film}} while making Spellbound, a documentary about 1999's Scripps National Spelling Bee, but an HBO Films executive persuaded him to write the film based on his own adolescence {{when he told her}} about his experiences as a stutterer. The film's producers visited several cities in the United States and Canada; Thompson was cast based on <b>a</b> <b>tape</b> which his agent had sent and a follow-up audition after the first actor cast in the lead was forced to pull out.

At the conference, Smith was presented <b>a</b> <b>tape</b> by a lecturer who used doctored images to achieve his goal of losing weight. The photos showed the lecturer what he would look like if he were thinner as motivation to reach his weight-loss goals.

He proceeded to place copies of the doctored photo in all of the players' lockers.|$|E
