He then folded the bag <b>and</b> <b>tucked</b> {{it into a}} pocket on his right thigh.

5|$|The Garter is worn on {{ceremonial}} occasions {{around the}} left calf by knights {{and around the}} left arm by ladies, and is depicted on several insignia. The Garter is a buckled dark-blue (originally light-blue) velvet strap, and bears the motto in gold letters. The garters of Stranger Knights and Ladies were once set with several jewels. Two styles have been used: one is a working garter where the end slips through the buckle and then is tucked in a specific way and the other style is a 'pre-made' one that has the buckled <b>and</b> <b>tucked</b> end pre-fashioned and is fastened with a clip attachment.|$|E
5|$|There are {{references}} to bikinis in ancient literature as well. Ovid, the writer ranked alongside Virgil and Horace {{as one of}} the three canonical poets of Latin literature, suggests the breastband or long strip of cloth wrapped around the breasts <b>and</b> <b>tucked</b> in the ends, {{is a good place to}} hide love-letters. Martial, a Latin poet from Hispania who published between AD 86 and 103, satirized a female athlete he named Philaenis, who played ball in a bikini-like garb quite bluntly, making her drink, gorge and vomit in abundance and hinting at her lesbianism. In an epigram on Chione, Martial strangely mentions a sex worker who went to the bathhouse in a bikini, while it was more natural to go unclothed. Reportedly Theodora, the 6th century empress of the Byzantine Empire wore a bikini when she appeared as an actress before she captured the heart of emperor Justinian I.|$|E

25|$|Cross – A powerful, {{straight}} punch thrown {{with the}} rear hand. From the guard position, the rear hand is thrown from the chin, crossing {{the body and}} traveling towards the target in a straight line. The rear shoulder is thrust forward and finishes just touching {{the outside of the}} chin. At the same time, the lead hand is retracted <b>and</b> <b>tucked</b> against the face to protect the inside of the chin. For additional power, the torso and hips are rotated counter-clockwise as the cross is thrown. A measure of an ideally extended cross is that the shoulder of the striking arm, the knee of the front leg and the ball of the front foot are on the same vertical plane.|$|E

She {{said she felt}} lucky for having {{a chance to have}} [...] "great songs and great producers" [...] for the album. Cher said her favorite song slated for the album was a cover version of [...] "When the Money's Gone", written by Bruce Roberts, stating it was [...] "so perfect" [...] for her. [...] "It's about this person who's , 'If I lose all my money, will you still love me if we have to eat fast food out of a beat up car?'. It's so dance. It's so gay. It's so good", she said. The album cover, photographed by Michael Lavine, was revealed through Cher official website on October 8, 2001. It depicts Cher wearing a [...] "flowing" [...] blond wig in contrast to her all-black, medieval-like outfit.

Rumors indicated that Sawa had a contract dispute with New Line concerning the deduction of his salary; however, Perry resolved {{the issue with}} the statement that [...] "it had everything to do with narrative, and nothing to do with money or Devon’s unwillingness to come back." [...] Despite this, New Line reinstated Ali Larter to reprise her character as Clear Rivers. [...] "When New Line asked me to come back, I thought it was great. They showed me the script and let me have some input, and it was really terrific," [...] Larter revealed. Larter indicated that Clear [...] " [...] gotten to a hardened place <b>and</b> <b>tucked</b> herself inside because she has felt so much pain in her life. By having herself committed to a mental hospital, she has created a safehouse so that Death can't get her." [...] Tony Todd also resumed his character as mortician William Bludworth. [...] "It’s the same character that we saw before that the audience loved," [...] Ellis expressed.|$|E
500|$|After each yell, {{students}} make a noise and a hand motion {{that is known}} as a wildcat. [...] Each class has a separate wildcat, and students caught [...] "pulling out," [...] or using the wildcat of a higher class, are often forced to do pushups as punishment. [...] Freshmen raise their hands above their heads and yell [...] "AAAA". [...] Sophomores, symbolically pushing back on the seniors, chant [...] "A!" [...] five times, waving their hands up and {{down in front of the}} torso with their index fingers extended and thumbs perpendicular. [...] Juniors yell [...] "A! A! A! Whoop!" [...] wrapping their left hand over their right fist, with both index fingers extended and pointing towards the ground, [...] "shooting the ground" [...] once for each [...] "A" [...] and holding the position on the [...] "whoop!" [...] As a symbol of their expert marksmanship, seniors yell a single [...] "A!" [...] and then [...] "Whoop!" [...] while interlocking their fingers with their index fingers extended and pointed into the air. [...] At the same time, the left foot is raised <b>and</b> <b>tucked</b> behind the right knee. [...] The fingers are interlocked rather than covering the right hand so that the Aggie Ring is visible.|$|E

500|$|The women's {{race was}} the 71st contest between OUWBC and CUWBC, and started at 3:10p.m. on 27 March 2016. The overall {{record in the}} event before the race stood at 41–29 in Cambridge's favour. [...] Weather {{conditions}} were poor, described in The Daily Telegraph {{an hour before the}} race as [...] "terrible ... hail, thunder, lightning, the works". [...] Although conditions improved by the start time, it was still windy and the river was rough. [...] Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey side of the river. [...] Cambridge made the better start and held a slight lead, but after passing the Mile Post level, OUWBC made a push to hold a half-length lead after five minutes, and were almost clear by Harrods Furniture Depository. [...] Cambridge, two seconds down as the crews passed below Hammersmith Bridge, were forced to take evasive action but kept in touch despite multiple warnings from the umpire. [...] The Light Blues made for the shelter of the shore as the conditions worsened and both boats took on water, while Oxford remained in the rough water, losing some of their advantage. [...] Oxford were eight seconds ahead by Chiswick Steps <b>and</b> <b>tucked</b> into the Middlesex bank while Cambridge remained in the more traditional racing line, taking on a substantial amount of water. [...] At Barnes Bridge, Cambridge began to sink and received advice to pull to the side. The Cambridge cox indicated that she wanted to continue to complete the course and was allowed to do so. Oxford passed the finishing post in 21 minutes 49 seconds, 24 lengths ahead of the Light Blues, taking the overall record to 41–30 in Cambridge's favour.|$|E

2500|$|The men's {{version of}} the loros was a long strip, {{dropping}} down straight in front to below the waist, and with the portion behind pulled round {{to the front and}} hung gracefully over the left arm. The female loros was similar at the front end, but the back end was wider <b>and</b> <b>tucked</b> under a belt after pulling through to the front again. Both male and female versions changed style and diverged in the middle Byzantine period, the female later reverting to the new male style. Apart from jewels and embroidery, small enamelled plaques were sewn into the clothes; the dress of Manuel I Comnenus was described as being like a meadow covered with flowers. Generally sleeves were closely fitted to the arm and the outer dress comes to the ankles (although often called a scaramangion), and is also rather closely fitted. [...] The sleeves of empresses became extremely wide in the later period.|$|E
2500|$|Boat 8 {{was loaded}} with 28 people under the {{supervision}} of Second Officer Lightoller and launched at about 1:00a.m., with Captain Smith and Chief Officer Wilde participating.

Ida Straus, wife of New York merchant Isidor Straus, was asked to join a group of people preparing to board but refused, saying, [...] "I will not be separated from my husband. As we have lived, so will we die– together." [...] The 67-year-old Isidor likewise refused an offer to board on account of his age, saying: [...] "I do not wish any distinction in my favor which is not granted to others." [...] They were last seen alive on deck arm in arm. Major Archibald Butt, military aide to US President William Howard Taft, escorted to the boat Marie Young, a former music teacher to the children of President Theodore Roosevelt. She later recalled he [...] "wrapped blankets about me <b>and</b> <b>tucked</b> me in as carefully as if we were going on a motor ride." [...] He wished her farewell and good luck, asking her to [...] "remember me to the folks back home."
