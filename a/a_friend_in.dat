5|$|Lyrically, “Between You and Me” {{stresses}} the importance of seeking forgiveness from <b>a</b> <b>friend.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the bridge of the song addresses the need for confessing one's sins to God. DC Talk member Toby McKeehan, co-writer of the song, said that the lyrics simply describe the way relationships work. McKeehan later elaborated in an interview that the song came from his relationship with fellow band members Michael Tait and Kevin Max.|$|E

5|$|Göring {{was born}} on 12 January 1893 at the Marienbad Sanatorium in Rosenheim, Bavaria. His father, Heinrich Ernst Göring (31 October 1839– 7 December 1913), a former cavalry officer, {{had been the first}} Governor-General of the German {{protectorate}} of South-West Africa, (modern-day Namibia). Heinrich had five children from a previous marriage. Göring was the fourth of five children by Heinrich's second wife, Franziska Tiefenbrunn (1859–15 July 1943), a Bavarian peasant. Göring's elder siblings were Karl, Olga, and Paula; his younger brother was Albert. At the time that Göring was born, his father was serving as consul general in Haiti, and his mother had returned home briefly to give birth. She left the six-week-old baby with <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> Bavaria and did not see the child again for three years, when she and Heinrich returned to Germany.|$|E

Secret Service agent Gruszynski (Ed Lauter) confronts Lewis and Crosetti and tells them not to waste the embassy's time, but agrees to give the detectives a tour of Washington before they go. Crosetti is excited to see the landmarks but Lewis, who believes the Secret Service agent knows who committed the murder, remains confrontational with Gruszynski. When Gruszynski still refuses to help, Crosetti and a frustrated Lewis leave Washington.|$|E

Melvin then relocated to New Lisbon, Ohio, for a year to further his law studies under the instruction of <b>a</b> <b>friend.</b> <b>In</b> 1853, at the age of 18, he passed his bar examination and was admitted to the bar of Hancock County.

5|$|Tipu then {{ordered the}} {{destruction}} of all 27 churches in Canara. According to oral tradition, the Idgah mosque in Mangalore was constructed with stones from the destroyed Milagres Church. Other Christian establishments that were spared were converted to storehouses, offices, or homes for wealthy Muslims. A popular fortification in Mangalore, the Sultan Battery, built in 1784 by Tipu Sultan to prevent English warships from entering the Gurupura river, was constructed with stones taken from destroyed churches. The bells from the demolished churches eventually {{found their way into}} a number of temples in the area. After being informed of the impending roundup by <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> Tipu's government, Fr. Joachim Miranda disbanded St. Joseph's Seminary and sent the seminarians to Verapoly, from where some proceeded to Goa while some joined the Augustinian order.|$|E
5|$|After Watkin's {{retirement}} from management, {{relations between the}} MR and GCR deteriorated rapidly over shared use of Baker Street station and the congested route into London, and soon broke down completely. On 30 July 1898 John Bell, General Manager of the Metropolitan Railway, {{took control of the}} Quainton Road signal box himself and refused to allow a GCR train onto MR-owned tracks {{on the grounds that it}} was scheduled to take the Great Western rather than the Metropolitan route south of Aylesbury, while on one occasion in 1901 King Edward VII was travelling home after visiting <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> Wendover; the MR signalman allowed a slow goods train to run in front of the royal train, causing the King to arrive late back in London. The MR management also refused the GCR permission to install points to connect their engine shed at Aylesbury to the railway line, on the grounds that the land for the shed had been bought clandestinely. Eventually a parallel set of tracks was built for the GCR between Harrow and London, running alongside the MR to a separate terminus at Marylebone, a short distance from Baker Street. The GCR continued to share the less-congested section between Quainton Road and Harrow—including Chalfont Road station—with the MR.|$|E

5|$|After {{reaching}} the Western Conference Final in the 2006 playoffs, the newly renamed Anaheim Ducks entered the 2006–07 season with high expectations; the team brought Selänne {{back with a}} one-year, $3.75 million contract. He reached several milestones during the season: Selänne became the 36th player in NHL history, and second Finn after Jari Kurri, to score 500 goals, on November 22, 2006, against Colorado. On December 31, he played his 1,000th NHL game. As part of a season in which he again led Anaheim in goals (48) and points (94), Selänne played in his tenth All-Star Game in 2007, and scored his first hat-trick in six years (the 19th of his career) on January 12, 2007. It was the same day he spoke with <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> Finland with terminal cancer and whom asked to be sent the game puck if Selänne had a three-goal game. Finally, he scored his 301st goal as a Duck on February 18, 2007, to break Paul Kariya's franchise record.|$|E
5|$|After the Thuns {{learned the}} game, they began {{teaching}} its rules to their fraternity brothers at Williams College around 1926. Daniel W. Layman, in turn, learned {{the game from}} the Thun brothers (who later tried to sell copies of the game commercially, but were advised by an attorney that the game could not be patented, as they were not its inventors). Layman later returned to his hometown of Indianapolis, Indiana, and began playing the game with friends there, ultimately producing hand-made versions of the board based on streets of that city. Layman then commercially produced and sold the game, starting in 1932, with <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> Indianapolis, who owned a company called Electronic Laboratories. This game was sold under the name The Fascinating Game of Finance (later shortened to Finance). Layman soon sold his rights to the game, which was then licensed, produced and marketed by Knapp Electric. The published board featured four railroads (one per side), Chance and Community Chest cards and spaces, and properties grouped by symbol, rather than color. Also in 1932, one edition of The Landlord's Game was published by the Adgame Company with {{a new set of}} rules called Prosperity, also by Magie.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Germans {{occupied}} Oslo and at 17:30 Norwegian radio ceased broadcasting at {{the request}} of the occupying forces. With German support, at approximately 19:30, Quisling entered the NRK studios in Oslo and proclaimed the formation of a new government with himself as Prime Minister. He also revoked an earlier order to mobilise against the German invasion. He still lacked legitimacy. Two orders—the first, to <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> the military (Colonel Hans S. Hiorth, the commanding officer of the army regiment at Elverum) to arrest the government, and the second, to the Oslo chief of police—were both ignored. At 22:00, Quisling resumed broadcasting, repeating his earlier message and reading out a list of new ministers. Hitler lent his support as promised, and recognised the new Norwegian government under Quisling within 24 hours. Norwegian batteries were still firing on the German invasion force, and at 03:00 on 10 April, Quisling acceded to a German request to halt the resistance of the Bolærne fortress. As a result of actions such as these, it was claimed at the time that Quisling's seizure of power in a puppet government had been part of the German plan all along.|$|E

5|$|Paul Kagame {{was still}} in the United States {{at the time of the}} {{outbreak}} of war, attending the military training course in Fort Leavenworth. He and Rwigyema had been in frequent contact by telephone throughout his stay in Kansas, planning the final details for the October invasion. At the end of September, Kagame informed the college that he was leaving the course, and was settling his affairs ready to return to Africa as the invasion began. The college allowed him to leave with several textbooks, which he later used in planning tactics for the war. When Kagame learned of Rwigyema's death on 5 October, he departed immediately to take command of the RPF troops. He flew through London and Addis Ababa, eventually arriving at Entebbe Airport, where he was given safe passage by <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> the Ugandan secret service; the police considered arresting him, but with Museveni out of the country, and no specific orders, they allowed him to pass. Ugandan associates drove Kagame to the border, and he crossed into Rwanda early on 15 October.|$|E
5|$|With the Burger's {{house now}} empty, Rosa sells it and moves in with Conrad, {{a student who}} had befriended her during her father's trial. Conrad {{questions}} her about {{her role in the}} Burger family and asks why she always did what she was told. Later Rosa leaves Conrad and moves into a flat on her own and works as a physiotherapist. In 1975 Rosa attends a party of <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> Soweto, and it is there that she hears a black university student dismissing all whites' help as irrelevant, saying that whites cannot know what blacks want, and that blacks will liberate themselves. Despite being labelled a Communist and under surveillance by the authorities, Rosa manages to get a passport, and flies to Nice in France to spend several months with Katya, her father's first wife. There she meets Bernard Chabalier, a visiting academic from Paris. They become lovers and he persuades her to return with him to Paris.|$|E
5|$|Yasui had {{consulted}} <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> the FBI {{prior to}} arrest, and consulted with other legal minds {{to try to}} test {{the legality of the}} orders. At trial he was defended by private attorney Earl Bernard. Gus J. Solomon, later a judge for the same court, had asked the national American Civil Liberties Union to defend Yasui as no local Oregon groups elected to support Yasui. One part of the strategy was to proceed with a non-jury trial, leaving the decision only to the judge. Solomon was asked by Fee to help advise the court on the issues, along with eight other attorneys. At his trial, federal judge James Alger Fee {{came to the conclusion that}} laws specifically targeting a race, such as the curfew, were unconstitutional when applied to citizens. However, he also declared in his November 16, 1942, decision that Yasui had demonstrated his loyalty to Japan and was therefore no longer a U.S. citizen. Yasui was sentenced to one year in prison and given a $5000 fine.|$|E
