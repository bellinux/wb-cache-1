40|$|Meat {{products}} often {{consist of}} meat from multiple <b>animal</b> <b>species,</b> and inaccurate food product adulteration and mislabeling can negatively affect consumers. Therefore, a cost-effective and reliable method for identification and quantification of <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> in meat <b>products</b> is required. In this study, {{we developed a}} duplex droplet digital PCR (dddPCR) detection and quantification system to simultaneously identify and quantify the source of meat in samples containing a mixture of beef (Bos taurus) and pork (Sus scrofa) in a single digital PCR reaction tube. Mixed meat samples of known composition were {{used to test the}} accuracy and applicability of this method. The limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) of this detection and quantification system were also identified. We conclude that our dddPCR detection and quantification system is suitable for quality control and routine analyses of meat products...|$|R
40|$|Background: The use of {{the generic}} term “meat and animal derivatives” in {{declared}} ingredient lists of pet foods in the European Union is virtually universal. In {{the wake of the}} 2013 “horse meat scandal” in the human food chain, we examined the presence and authenticity of animal sources (cow, chicken, pig and horse) of proteins in a range of popular wet pet foods in the United Kingdom. Findings: Seventeen leading dog and cat foods were sampled for the relative presence of DNA from each of the four <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. No horse DNA was detected. However, there was detection at substantial levels of unspecified <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> in most <b>products</b> tested. In 14 out of 17 samples, bovine, porcine and chicken DNA were found in various proportions and combinations but were not explicitly identified on the product labels. Of the 7 products with prominent headline descriptions containing the term “with beef”, only 2 were found to contain more bovine DNA (> 50...|$|R
40|$|Nucleic acid-based {{vaccines}} such as viral vectors, plasmid DNA (pDNA), and mRNA {{are being}} developed {{as a means to}} address limitations of both live-attenuated and subunit vaccines. DNA vaccines {{have been shown to be}} potent in a wide variety of <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> and several <b>products</b> are now licensed for commercial veterinary but not human use. Electroporation delivery technologies have been shown to improve the generation of T and B cell responses from synthetic DNA vaccines in many <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> and now in humans. However, parallel RNA approaches have lagged due to potential issues of potency and production. Many of the obstacles to mRNA vaccine development have recently been addressed, resulting in a revival in the use of non-amplifying and self-amplifying mRNA for vaccine and gene therapy applications. In this paper, we explore the utility of EP for the in vivo delivery of large, self-amplifying mRNA, as measured by reporter gene expression and immunogenicity of genes encoding HIV envelope protein. These studies demonstrated that EP delivery of self-amplifying mRNA elicited strong and broad immune responses in mice, which were comparable to those induced by EP delivery of pDNA...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a new phage-typing method and evaluated its application in combination with XbaI macrorestriction analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) as {{a useful tool for}} the long-term epidemiology of Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis. In this study, we investigated 1008 S. Infantis isolates recovered from humans, various <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> and food <b>products</b> from 1973 to 2009. The typing scheme is based on 17 typing phages, defining 61 different patterns within the strain collection. The experiments showed that phage typing is a reliable method for differentiation of outbreaks and sporadic clinical cases as well as for elucidation of chains of transmission. The combined analysis of phage typing and PFGE revealed the existence of epidemic clones with a high stability over time like PT 29 /XB 27 which was identified in nosocomial salmonellosis, community outbreaks as well as in broiler chickens from 2002 to 2009.

40|$|Various {{ammonium}} sulfate concentrations and reaction conditions {{were employed in}} the fractionation of sera from rabbits, sheep, horses, and goats. Precipitates and supernatant fluids were analyzed by electrophoresis to {{study the effects of}} the controlled variables. At room temperature, the third precipitate in 35 % saturated (NH 4) 2 SO 4 was the best fraction from both rabbit and sheep sera; 80 to 90 % of the gamma globulins were recovered. The second and third precipitates of horse sera proteins in 30 % saturated (NH 4) 2 SO 4 were both satisfactory, but only 44 % of the gamma globulin was recovered after three precipitations. Goat sera yielded a very satisfactory fraction; 80 % of the gamma globulin was recovered after two precipitations—the first in 30 % and the second in 45 % saturated (NH 4) 2 SO 4. The composition of these fractions was not influenced by the pH of the sulfate solutions (pH 5. 8 and 7. 2), by a range of normal room temperatures (20 to 30 C), or by diluting the sera before fractionation. Crude globulins and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled globulins were successfully refractionated by one precipitation in the optimal sulfate concentration for the appropriate <b>animal</b> <b>species.</b> The refractionated <b>products</b> contained considerably less beta and alpha globulins than did the original crude fractions and little or no albumin...|$|R
