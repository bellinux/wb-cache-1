5|$|Ashley Smith (born 29 January 1988, New Brunswick, Canada) {{was adopted}} {{when she was}} 5 days old, and {{according}} to her <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents,</b> Coralee Smith and Herbert Gober, had a normal childhood in Moncton, New Brunswick. Between the ages of 13-14, her parents noted distinct behavioural changes in the child; by age 15 she had been before juvenile court 14 times for various minor offences such as throwing crabapples at a mailman, trespassing, and causing a disturbance. In March 2002, Smith was assessed by a psychologist who {{found no evidence of}} mental illness. However, her behavioural problems continued and she was suspended from school multiple times in the fall of 2002. In March 2003, after multiple court appearances, Smith was admitted to the Pierre Caissie Centre for assessment. She was diagnosed with ADHD, learning disorder, borderline personality disorder and narcissistic personality traits. She was discharged several days early from the Centre for unruly and disruptive behaviour and returned to the New Brunswick Youth Centre (NBYC). Smith was remanded to the NBYC multiple times over the next 3 years; during this time she was involved in more than 800 reported incidents and at least 150 attempts to physically harm herself.|$|E
5|$|Diablo Cody {{was first}} {{approached}} {{to write a}} screenplay by film producer Mason Novick, who had previously landed her a book deal for her memoir, , after discovering her blog about stripping. He persuaded her to adapt the book for the screen, but suggested that she first write a screenwriting sample to show studios; that sample became Juno. After deciding on an adoption storyline, Cody collected the stories of adoptees, birth parents and <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents,</b> including that of her then-husband, an adoptee who reunited with his birth parents after she wrote the film. She also found inspiration {{in the story of}} a close friend who had become pregnant in high school and used some details from her friend's experience in the film, such as mistreatment from an ultrasound technician. Much of Juno, however, was based on Cody's own high school experiences: She dated a tic-tac-loving boy similar to Paulie, she was best friends with a cheerleader like Leah, and she used a hamburger phone identical to the one that appears in the film. After writing the screenplay over seven weeks in the Starbucks section of a Target store in Crystal, Minnesota, Cody compared writing to breathing, seeing Juno as an extension of herself.|$|E
5|$|Amy {{discovers that}} Kyle's <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> have died. She and Victoria attend the funeral {{to see if}} Kyle is there and see him at the wake with his adoptive grandmother, Joanie Wright (Denise Black). When Kyle drops his toy, Amy {{picks it up and}} tries to give it back but Joanie doesn't hear her so she keeps it. Amy returns the next day and a barmaid gives her Joanie's address. Amy plans to return the toy but changes her mind and leaves. Needing to see Kyle, she persuades Andy to let her take baby Jack to Kyle's playgroup and makes friends with Joanie, telling her that she is {{studying}} childcare and asking if she needs any help with Kyle. Joanie accepts and allows Amy to look after Kyle occasionally. Val is thrilled when she finds out but Victoria and Eric think it is a bad idea and Eric tells Joanie that Amy is Kyle's birth mother. Disgusted, Joanie refuses to let Amy see Kyle again but is eventually persuaded to change her mind. Sadly, while Amy and Kyle are on a picnic together, Kyle almost drowns and Joanie blames Amy. She promptly bans her from seeing Kyle and refuses to even consider changing her mind, even calling the police when Amy visits repeatedly, who warn her to stay away. Desperate to see her son, Amy and Andy (who she is now dating) call Social Services to see if she can get custody but the social worker tells her that being awarded custody is very unlikely. Feeling now that the adoption was a mistake, Amy decides to snatch Kyle and go on the run. Kerry, understanding how Amy feels, tries to talk her out of it but when she can't, decides to help her. They go to Kyle's playgroup and kidnap him and Kerry drives them to the docks. During the drive, Val phones repeatedly but they don't answer. Eventually Kerry answers and Amy tearfully reveals her plans before throwing the phone away. Eric checks the computer's internet history and finds out where Amy is going. Cain, Andy, Val, Eric and Joanie all rush to the docks. In the end, Cain persuades Amy to return Kyle, warning her of the complications of the life on the run and how Kyle might be affected. She says goodbye to Kyle and gives him to Cain but fearing she'll be sent to prison, Amy leaves, devastating Val. Val later gets a call from Amy and learns that she is living in Ireland with her aunt.|$|E

40|$|Becoming an <b>adoptive</b> <b>parent</b> is {{not always}} easy. There are {{positive}} and negative factors affecting the parent‚Äôs experience. The {{aim of this study}} is to examine being an <b>adoptive</b> <b>parent</b> to an internationally adopted child based on association, parenthood and ethnic belonging. Frame of interpretation consists of attachment and separations, parenthood and family and ethnic origin and belonging. In order to fulfil the purpose of the study qualitative interviews were made. The selection consisted of six adoptive families that were separately interviewed, one occasion each. The result indicated that some families did not experience any specific difficulties in their parenting whereas other families did. The experiences differed between those who had adopted an older child and those who had adopted a younger child. Association was considered a long and time consuming process. The parents did not consider it to be anything special about being and <b>adoptive</b> <b>parent</b> but they mentioned that the child at the homecoming displayed symptoms from having gone through an adoption. The reaction from the surroundings had not affected the families to any extent worth mentioning but they still expressed that the child‚Äôs appearance was important as they wished the child to be similar looking. The conclusion is therefore that it is something special about being an <b>adoptive</b> <b>parent.</b> ...|$|R
