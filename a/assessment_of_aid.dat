40|$|Provisions on the {{restriction}} of State aids form {{an important part}} of the primary and secondary EU competition law. The basic premise of the regulation is the circumstance that aid provided by States from public resources to enterprises can distort the competition within the EU and therefore is declared for incompatible with the EU internal market. At the same time we must realise that there are several situations in which a suitably scheduled State aids can act as a positive input to the development of the internal market and therefore a complete prohibition of State aids would be rather counter-productive. In several areas of the competition regulation rules and criteria for the admissibility of suitable State aids are formulated by the EU law. The rules for the admissibility of State aids for the support of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are one of these areas. The aim of the present article is to analyze the requirements for the provision of State aids to the SMEs as laid down by the SME block exemption of 2001 and, consequently, by the new GBER in force since 29 August 2008. Consequently the article analyses the impact of the State aids both on the supported SME and on the relevant market and/or the potential distortion of the completion it may cause.

40|$|Background: In post-conflict settings, {{many state}} and non-state actors {{interact}} at the sub-national levels in rebuilding health systems by providing funds, delivering vital interventions and building capacity of {{local governments to}} shoulder their roles. Aid relationships among actors at sub-national level represent a vital lever for health system development. This study was undertaken to assess the aid-effectiveness in post-conflict districts of northern Uganda. Method: This was a three district cross sectional study conducted from January to April 2013. A two stage snowball approach used to construct a relational-network for each district. Managers of organizations (ego) involved service delivery were interviewed and asked to list the external organizations (alters) that contribute to three key services. For each inter-organizational relationship (tie) a custom-made tool designed to reflect the aid-effectiveness in the Paris Declaration was used. Results: Three hundred eighty four relational ties between the organizations were generated from a total of 85 organizations interviewed. Satisfaction with aid relationships was mostly determined by 1) the extent ego was able to negotiate own priorities, 2) ego's awareness of expected results, and 3) provision of feedback about ego's performance. Respectively, the B coefficients were 16 %, 38 % and 19 %. Disaggregated analysis show that satisfaction of fund-holders was also determined by addressing own priorities (30 %), while provider satisfaction was mostly determined by awareness of expected results (66 %) and feedback on performance (23 %). All results were significant at p-value of 0. 05. Overall, the regression models in these analyses accounted for 44 % to 62 % of the findings. Conclusion: Sub-national <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> effectiveness is feasible with indicators adapted from the global parameters. These findings illustrate the focus on "results" domain and less on "ownership" and "resourcing" domains. The capacity and space for sub-national level authorities to negotiate local priorities requires more attention especially for health system development in post-conflict settings. © 2017 The Author(s) ...|$|E

The popular notion that development effectiveness can be ensured through the targeting of aid towards countries classified as good performers by idealized sets of indicators has been discredited. Recent policy research suggests that, despite the risks involved, aid does the most good when it benefits the weakest and poorest economies and those most vulnerable to shock. But to achieve development effectiveness at country level, coherence of interventions is critical, as is judicious sequencing. Development operations should be (i) selected to fit within coherent country assistance strategies; (ii) aligned with the priorities of the country and (iii) coordinated with other policies and actions of partners. Ultimately, this is because the quality of aid matters as much as its quantity: aid is a transmission belt for ideas, a device to train development leaders, an instrument to build state capacity and a platform for policy experimentation and dissemination. The final proposition offered by this paper is that professionally administered aid works, but that it would work even better in concert with reforms of rich countries 2 ̆ 019 policies geared to levelling the playing field of the global market and to peace building and human security in the zones of turmoil of the developing world. 2 ̆ 013 aid; policies; projects; programmes; country strategie...|$|E

40|$|Sierra Leones ranks {{amongst the}} poorest {{countries}} in {{the world in terms of}} per capita GDP, due to several factors. Concerning the agricultural sector and more specifically smallholders, which constitute the big majority of farmers, inadequate tools, land preparation, infrastructure and limited access to markets and inputs, adding to very low labour productivity, cause that smallholders operate far below their productive potential, with crop production remaining primarily driven by (semi) subsistence households generating very little income. Consequently, Sierra Leone's subsistence farming system is characterised by a highly inefficient input/output mixes as well as high pre harvest and post harvest losses. Farmers lack access to yield-increasing inputs (such as improved tools) and face limited ability to invest in economic activities not only due to credit shortage but also to village-level institutional arrangements which do not support using land as collateral for loans. Lastly, reduced cash-income keeps smallholders particularly vulnerable to remain in the poverty-trap. The present report analyses the results of a survey of 604 smallholders in 5 districts in the Northern and Eastern regions of Sierra Leone carried out in 2009 when the EU STABEX-funded projects were concluding. The purpose is on the one hand, to improve knowledge and understanding of the agri-economic and social conditions of rural areas in Sierra Leone, and on the other hand to provide a general <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> programmes financed in this area by the 8 th European Development Fund. For this reason, the regions selected for the survey were those representatives of the main agricultural areas of the country where support was provided: the Northern region largely dominated by rice farmers, and the Eastern region where rice farmers are also engaged in coffee and cocoa production under agro-forestry plots. While rice (main staple food) production is expected to comply with food security objectives, coffee and cocoa (main export commodities) are high value export commodities which push economic growth. Consequently, both types of crops are considered relevant in contributing to the country's development. The results of the economic analysis indicate that rice production, which largely covers own household consumption, is far below its potential due to high losses, low productivity and labour-intensity of farming, particularly in the Northern region. On the other hand, coffee and cocoa production in the Eastern region was found to be economically profitable, generating income for most of those smallholders who cultivate those crops. Regarding farm households' characteristics and income, strong regional differences between the poorer North and relatively wealthier East were observed and reflected throughout all factors analysed: yields, household size, sources of farming income, magnitude of losses and productivity. Households in the Eastern region who produce coffee and cocoa, also dispose on average of more family labour, more land and higher income compared to households in the Northern Region. Rice was recognized as being an imperative component for food security while the high market value of coffee and cocoa confirmed both commodities as important sources of income and foreign currency. Qualitative data from the survey indicated that the STABEX aid programmes were perceived as adequate in terms of their technical nature as well as regarding infrastructure and organizational improvements. However, the amount of aid was deemed altogether insufficient considering the number of households requiring assistance. In this sense, the responses to perceived adequacy do not evaluate the measure itself, but rather the amount provided in relation to local needs as understood by the recipients. Based on this analysis a set of recommendations for the policy are drawn. JRC. J. 4 -Agriculture and Life Sciences in the Econom...|$|E
40|$|In 1997, William Easterly {{authored}} {{an intriguing}} paper titled “The Ghost of Financing Gap:How the Harrod-Domar Model Still Haunts Development Economics”. His investigation showsthat the Harrod-Domar model fails drastically {{in explaining the}} performance of investment andgrowth. He reveals that the Harrod-Domar model, which supposedly died 40 years ago, is stillused by leading international and regional organizations. Indeed, more than 90 percent of thecountry economists in the World Bank still use the model to make growth and resource requirementsprojections, and to provide advice on economic policy. We argue in this paper {{that in addition to}} its well known shortcomings, the Harrod-Domar modelis susceptible to the misinterpretation that all capital inflows (mainly foreign assistance in the caseof Africa) required to fill the financing gap would be invested. This is because it focuses on thesaving-investment relationship in a planned sense (ex ante). In practice, once the foreign exchangeto bridge the ‘planned’ resource gap is obtained, {{there is no guarantee that}} all of it would financeinvestment. The wrong presumption that all foreign exchange resources to fill the domestic resourcegap would be invested gave rise to the aid-financed investment paradigm. Recent research has announced the failure of the aid-financed investment in Africa on the empiricalgrounds that a dollar of ODA did not lead to a dollar of investment. We argue that such a conclusionis misleading because it was based on a faulty hypothesis. In many African countries, foreign aidto bridge the resource gap, particularly under program aid might be predestined, by design, toconsumption and not investment. The presumption that all foreign assistance is intended forinvestment might have partly contributed to the negative <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> effectiveness, and hence,to the diminished public support in donor countries for aid programs. This paper introduces the extended version of the Balance of Payments Constraint growth modeldue to Thirlwall and Hussain (1982), as an alternative approach to replace the Harrod-Domarmodel in development practice. Unlike the Harrod-Domar model, the Thirlwall-Hussain model isnot liable to the presumption that all aid would be invested. It clearly shows that the requiredcapital inflows to fill the domestic resource gap would finance imports and that, at least, part ofthese imports would be for consumption and not for investment. Also, the Thirlwall-Hussain modelis capable of measuring, separately, the effects of import volume, export volume, the terms oftrade, domestic inflation and the exchange rate on the amount of foreign exchange required toachieve a target growth rate. The paper illustrates the use of the Thirlwall-Hussain model in measuring the financing gap using asample of 24 African countries. The illustration is conducted against the objective of reducing thenumber of the poor by 4 percent per annum as a requirement for achieving the internationaldevelopment goal of reducing poverty by 50 percent by the year 2015. The results show that given the terms of trade, export volume and initial imbalance in the currentaccount, virtually all the countries in the sample would require large inflows of foreign resources toachieve this target. If export performance is not improved relative to imports, the financing gapwould increase overtime, snowballing to very large amounts. For the 24 countries in the sample,the financing gap is estimated at a total of US $ 44. 8 billion (or 19. 5 percent of projected GDP) per annum in the first five planning years alone. The cumulative amount of resources for all the 24 countries over the first five planning years reaches about US $ 224 billion. However the results obtained should be considered as illustrative of the use of the Thirlwall-Hussain model in measuring the financing gap rather than indicative of the amount of foreignassistance required. This is mainly because the model is applied using generalized assumptionsabout future growth in the model’s variables. Intimate knowledge of individual country circumstanceswould enable the development practitioner to come up with more informed predictions. Unaffected by the quality of data is the theoretical finding of the Thirlwall-Hussain model. Byshifting the focus from the saving-investment relationship to the export-import relationship, themodel provides new pointers for development strategies and for measuring the effectiveness ofdevelopment assistance. It demonstrates that foreign aid can contribute to higher growth ratebecause it finances the excess of imports over exports. However, the model implies that such adependency on aid to support higher growth rates will continue unless the production structureand the pattern of trade in the recipient country are changed to increase export expansion relativeto imports. Thus, if the ultimate goal of foreign assistance is to help poor countries graduate to a self-sustaininggrowth path, the model implies two broad pointers for measuring the long-term developmenteffectiveness of foreign aid. The effectiveness of development assistance should be measuredeither in terms of its ability to promote export relative to imports in the recipient country and/or interms of its ability to create the conditions that will attract private capital. However, even in thislatter case, the model implies that development effectiveness of private capital must be measuredby their contribution to expanding export earnings relative to imports. The basic lesson for development practice is that when foreign exchange is the binding constraint,which is the case of most African countries, overall rates of return on aggregate investment oughtto be measured in terms of foreign exchange earnings. Development practitioners should, thereforeconcentrate less on monitoring the ‘Harrod-Domar variables’ such as saving and investment ratiosand more on innovative variables that reflect the foreign exchange productivity of investment. ...|$|E

Drawing on the empirical literature on aid allocation, we estimate the determinants <b>of</b> Italy’s bilateral <b>aid.</b> We use three groups of explanatory variables, reflecting national-interest, humanitarian and selectivity-related motivations. We find that the distribution of Italian bilateral resources is significantly affected by both national-interest (like foreign policy or trade) and humanitarian motives, related to recipients’ needs; the latter’s role, in particular, seems to have strengthened over time. There is ample room for improving selectivity, i. e., the capacity to direct ODA flows to â€œdeservingâ€ countries, where better policies and institutions are likely to increase aid effectiveness.

40|$|EASE (`Estimation and <b>Assessment</b> <b>of</b> Substance Exposure') is a {{knowledge-based}} system for assessing workplace exposure to potentially hazardous new substances. It {{was built for}} the Health and Safety Executive of the United Kingdom (HSE). EU regulations require a manufacturer of a new substance to notify the appropriate authority, who will carry out a risk <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> it. To <b>aid</b> this process, guidance {{is provided by the}} regulator for use by both authorities and manufacturers. This is usually provided as a paper document, but HSE decided that a computer based guidance system would be of benefit. Safety-related considerations and a desire for quality led to the system being developed in accordance with ISO 9001 standards. The system guides the user by offering a menu of appropriate choices whenever it needs information. The use of CommonKADS ensured that the problem requirements and the expert knowledge involved were captured within a standard framework which promoted unambiguous communic [...] ...|$|R
40|$|When {{marketing}} {{is viewed as}} a two-way system rather than the one-way process implicitly assumed by commonly accepted definitions, evaluation of the effectiveness of an organization’s marketing becomes more relevant than it was when organizations used a simple “marketing mix” model of marketing. This paper outlines an integrated method for the evaluation of marketing performance, combining concepts derived from several different social sciences, and building an evaluation framework using that model. The concepts used include a systems-based view of marketing, stakeholder management theory, actor-network theory, and futures studies, as well as the Program Logic family of approaches used initially in the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> foreign <b>aid</b> programs. As a test of the applicability of this framework, a pair of case studies is described. Though both cases were quite different from what might be viewed as "normal" marketing, the framework clearly accommodates both. The practical implication of the framework is that to fully evaluate the outcome of any marketing process, it is useful to consider the communications transmitted between all participants in the process; it can be seen {{as an extension of the}} Integrated Marketing Communications principle.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is devoted to}} studying the impact <b>of</b> international financial <b>aid</b> on economic growth in Europe after the Second World War. The aim of the investigation is the identification of regularities of post-war recovery of European economies {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century and the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> international financial <b>aid’s</b> role in the economic growth stimulation. The author summarizes domestic and foreign researchers’ achievements of studying the issue of the Marshall Plan and its importance for modern Ukraine, and differentiates the classic, capitalistic and modern stages of post-conflict reconstruction of the national economies. The relation between the amount of financial assistance from US government to 14 European countries and the growth of GDP in 1947 – 1952 is studied with the help of correlation and regression analysis and their significant linear dependence is determined. The issue of institutional support of international financing program of economic recovery of Europe has not been left without attention. ...|$|R
40|$|The EU State aid reform The {{implementation}} <b>of</b> the State <b>aid</b> {{action plan}} This work {{is divided into}} three sections. The first section defines State aid under the Article 107 (1) of the Treaty of Functioning of the EU. In this regard, {{on the basis of the}} EU Courts case law, it is explained what the "State resources" are, under which conditions the State intervention is "imputable to the State", what can be considered as "an undertaking" and "an advantage" as well as under which conditions an aid can have "an effect on trade and distort (or threaten to distort) the competition on the internal market". Consequently, Article 107 (2) and (3) of the TFEU is examined and the difference is highlighted between the State aid that is compatible per se on the basis of the TFEU and the State aid that may be declared compatible with the TFEU by the Commission. The second section is first dedicated to the principles on which the Action plan of was based. The role of the "refined economic approach" in general and the importance of "incentive effect of aid", "market failure" and "proportionality" for the compatibility <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> State <b>aid</b> in particular is discussed. In this context, the role of the "balancing test" is stressed out. Moreover, it is explained how it is incorporated by the Commission in the soft law [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} an <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> {{existing}} Norwegian <b>aid</b> country programmes in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda {{and how they}} relate to East African regional ambitions, supplemented by information on other donors’ direct support for the East African Community. A number of regional linkages and potentials are revealed. Four sectors or sub-sectors are identified for actions: energy; tertiary education; private sector development; and legal sector reform. Where joint assistance strategies have been formulated or are contemplated, regional dimensions should be raised and addressed. With regard to ongoing regional programmes, Norwegian assistance should continue and adjusted if need be, such as support for the Lake Victoria Basin Commission, and the Mount Elgon Regional Ecosystem Conservation Programme. Direct support to the East African Legislative Assembly should be continued and given a sharper focus. As a vehicle for donor basket funding and co-ordination the Partnership Fund should be given full support...|$|R
40|$|We have {{appraised}} {{the effectiveness}} <b>of</b> peer <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> assignments in <b>aiding</b> student learning at the University of Southern Queensland. Each student was randomly allocated two peers’ assignments for double-blind assessment. A marking rubric was provided. More than 95 % {{of the class}} participated in the process. Students’ peer-assessment work was evaluated by the instructor. Over 80 % of the students assessed their peers satisfactorily. Students' learning experiences, attitudes and behavior towards the peer assessment system was surveyed. More than 60 % of the students considered peer assessment a useful learning tool. However 25 % remained unconvinced. Most of these students either fully or partially subscribed to William Perry's position of 'dualism'. About 55 % found the feedback from their peer's useful. Surprisingly, > 69 % of the students believed that the peer assessment had nothing to contribute towards a students' community of practice...|$|R

This study is an attempt to give a preliminary <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the international <b>aid</b> to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). In this sense and because the study represents the views of analysts in an aid-recipient country this study is unique. Although it is still too early for a full <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the impact and long-run consequences of donor assistance being provided to the PNA, there are some preliminary conclusions that can be drawn at this stage. A close examination of the data confirms {{that one of the most}} pressing immediate goals <b>of</b> foreign <b>aid</b> to Palestine is that of political survival. The study highlights the need to reconsider issues of sectoral priority, project selection and the choice of development strategy by both local and international policy-makers involved in the nation-building process ongoing in the West Bank and Gaza Strip_ These issues have become more complicated due to the prolonged border closure of the Palestinian Territories (PTO by Israel most stringently since February 1996 on one hand. On the other hand, the failure of the PNA to follow a truly free market-oriented development strategy and to implement programs and projects of clear-cut priorities has added to this complication. All in all the commitment for peace is becoming intertwined with the commitment for development...|$|R
