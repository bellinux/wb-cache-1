5|$|In Tortuga, Jack hires a new crew, {{including}} Elizabeth and Norrington. With Elizabeth's use of Jack's compass, {{they are}} able to locate the chest. All parties arrive on Isla Cruces, where the chest is buried, but a three-way sword fight breaks out between Jack, Will, and Norrington, who <b>all</b> <b>want</b> the heart for their respective goals: Jack wants to call off the Kraken, Will wants to rescue his father, and Norrington wants to regain his life as a Navy officer. In the chaos, Norrington secretly steals the heart and runs off pretending to lure away the Dutchmans crew. Jones attacks the Pearl with the Kraken, which devours most of the crew and destroys {{all but one of the}} Pearls lifeboats, but Jack, who briefly flees the battle, returns and wounds the Kraken with a net full of explosives.|$|E

The phrase all one can seems to be closely related to <b>all</b> one <b>wants.</b> <b>All</b> one <b>wants</b> and <b>all</b> one can seem to occur in specific contexts, the general pattern of which can be construed as reflections of the meaning of these two phrases. The status of <b>all</b> one <b>wants</b> as a latecomer may be ascribed to the diachronic facts of want and other related predicates...|$|R

25|$|In one folk tale, Diaochan is {{captured}} by Cao Cao after the Battle of Xiapi. Cao Cao presents her to Guan Yu {{in the hope}} of winning Guan's loyalty. Guan Yu, however, suspects that he is being tricked when he recalls how Diaochan had betrayed Lü Bu and Dong Zhuo. He kills her to prevent her from doing further harm. In another tale, Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei <b>all</b> <b>want</b> to marry Diaochan, and they argue bitterly over the issue. Guan Yu kills her to end the dispute.|$|E
25|$|There is {{also the}} overall loss of privacy and peace when Agnes and Tobias are invaded by Claire, Julia, Harry, and Edna, who <b>all</b> <b>want</b> to live with them. The {{crowding}} of the house, the battles for space and understanding, the irritations and frustrations of trying to compromise, all eventually lead to the ultimate loss of balance. Where patience and social sensibility once were the rule, chaos and emotionalism reign. And the play ends with Agnes once again contemplating {{the loss of her}} sanity.|$|E
25|$|The Cheyennes do {{not fight}} {{at all this}} side of the Arkansas; they do not trouble Texas, but north of the Arkansas they are almost always at war. When lately north of the Arkansas, some young Cheyennes were fired upon and then the fight began. I have always done my best to keep my young men quiet, but some will not listen, and since the {{fighting}} began I {{have not been able to}} keep them all at home. But we <b>all</b> <b>want</b> peace, and I would be glad to move all my people down this way; I could then keep them all quietly near camp. My camp is now on the Washita, 40 miles east of the Antelope Hills, and I have there about 180 lodges. I speak only for my own people; I cannot speak nor control the Cheyennes north of the Arkansas.|$|E

25|$|Johnson {{is again}} {{on the run from}} Ashby and the miners. Nick and Rance are {{discussing}} Johnson and wonder what Minnie sees in him when Ashby arrives in triumph: Johnson has been captured. Rance and the miners <b>all</b> <b>want</b> Johnson to be hanged. Johnson accepts the sentence and only asks the miners not to tell Minnie about his capture and his fate ("Ch'ella mi creda"). Minnie arrives, armed with a pistol, just before the execution and throws herself in front of Johnson to protect him. While Rance tries to proceed, she convinces the miners that they owe her too much to kill the man she loves, and asks them to forgive him ("Ah! Ah! E Minnie!"). One by one, the miners yield to her plea ("E anche tu lo vorrai, Joe"). Rance is not happy but finally he too gives in. Sonora unties Johnson and sets him free. The miners bid Minnie farewell ("Le tue parole sono di Dio"). Minnie and Johnson leave California {{to start a new life}} together.|$|E

500|$|Kierkegaard, {{speaking}} {{in the voice of}} the upbuilding discourse at the end, says they are both wrong. They're both trying to find God in a childish way.

We <b>all</b> <b>want</b> to be in the right and never in the wrong. Once we find what we desire we find that it wasn't what we imagined it to be. So Kierkegaard says to leave it all to God.|$|E

500|$|Producer John Lloyd, {{speaking}} to The Times in 1989 hinted {{that it was}} the draining scripting and rehearsal process that led to the writers deciding not to make another series: [...] "Things do get very tense by the end of a series, because everyone involved in the thing is very clever, and very funny, and they <b>all</b> <b>want</b> to push the scripts along. It's a very exhausting process, {{and by the end of}} it we all swear we'll never, ever, do another one.

Although he was often called a travel writer, he did not identify as one nor did he consider himself a novelist. ("I don't quite {{know the meaning of}} the word novel," [...] he said). He preferred to call his writing stories or searches. He was interested in asking big questions about human existence, sharing unusual tales, and making connections between ideas from various sources.

[...] Nathan Slavik for DJ Booth {{was critical}} of the song, writing that it lacked any originality.

500|$|The {{writing of}} the album did not start until a year after La Dispute's debut album, Somewhere at the Bottom of the River Between Vega and Altair, was released. Part {{of the reason for}} the delay was the band's {{continuous}} touring and promotion of the debut across the United States and Canada, with rare tour and festival appearances in Europe and Australia. When commenting on the delay between the band's album releases, singer Jordan Dreyer said he {{and the rest of the}} band members require [...] "an absurdly long gestation period with these types of things and then we have to really sit down and be as meticulous as we <b>all</b> <b>want</b> to be". The band decided to use lyrical elements that they had intended to use in the first album but that were not included because they did not seem fully developed at the time. While writing La Dispute, the band had very specific goals; they projected the album to have 14 tracks and knew exactly what they wanted from each song.|$|E
