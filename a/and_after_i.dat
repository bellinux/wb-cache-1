500|$|Matthews' autobiography, The Way It Was, was {{released}} by Headline in 2000. The book is dedicated to his wife Mila, who died the year before its publication. Matthews, then 84, collaborated with Les Scott, his friend of 10 years, {{in the writing of}} the book over an 18-month period on an almost daily basis. [...] "Stan, as he had been all his life, was an early riser," [...] wrote Scott in the epilogue. [...] "Our collaborations were over by eleven in the morning and, without fail, took place in his den. He loved working on his book <b>and,</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> had left him, he would give the morning's session more applied thought — more often than not ringing me at home to provide additional thoughts or anecdotes." ...|$|E

He said the introspective chorus made him {{take a moment}} to reflect on his own rhymes. He detailed himself creating his verse saying, [...] "After I wrote my verse, it was my second show in Seattle. We did two shows, because I sold out both shows. There was like 2,000 the first night, and another 2,000 on the second night. So it was like, 'Whoa, we sold out both shows!' I was already tired from the night before, and we already had booked the studio time in Seattle. I went there, and I finished the last four bars of the verse I wrote. I wrote most of the verse—the first eight bars—on bus. It was getting closer to the show, and I wrote the last four bars at the studio because, our meet and greets aren’t an hour anymore. There’s like 300 people or 400 people, so you’re there until 6 pm now instead of 3 or 4. Now we got to go the studio, and I gotta be on stage at 9 pm, so it’s coming down to the wire I still have to eat and whatnot. But I did it, <b>and</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> did it, I’m like, 'Ooh, the verse is elite.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|He said he {{was left}} {{exhausted}} and depressed by his dealings with Kasenetz and Katz. [...] "In the mornings I {{would go into the}} office and start writing <b>and</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> had finished one song in a day, which was very high output for me, they'd {{come up to me and}} say: 'Give us another song!' And I'd say 'OK' – because I'm like that. They'd keep up the pressure so that I kept on writing. I was there in their offices working like that for six or eight weeks and when I flew home to Manchester I went straight round to see my doctor. I was feeling sick and could not eat. The doctor told me: 'You are totally over-worked.' I don't think I've ever felt so depressed as I did when I came back from New York." ...|$|E

Often I dreaded that some situation would catch me unaware and daub me with the yellow mud of a coward's reputation. I worried that I'd lose my temper, go haywire and end up before the grand jury twisting my uniform buttons nervously and begging for mercy. There was the wear and tear of wondering if the chiefs I served under would let me down when I needed to be backed up. <b>And</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> got to be chief, there was never a time when someone didn't hate my guts, and I had to be up on my toes to keep my enemies from feathering my back with knives.|$|E
