5|$|The {{density of}} an object is a rough guide to its composition: the lower the density, the higher the {{fraction}} of ices, and the lower the fraction of rock. The n denser objects, Vesta and Juno, <b>are</b> <b>composed</b> almost entirely of rock with very little ice, and have a density close to the Moon's, while the less dense, such as Proteus and Enceladus, <b>are</b> <b>composed</b> mainly of ice.|$|E
5|$|Another high-inclination {{group in}} the inner part of the {{asteroid}} belt is the Phocaea family. These <b>are</b> <b>composed</b> primarily of S-type asteroids, whereas the neighboring Hungaria family includes some E-types. The Phocaea family orbit between 2.25 and 2.5 AU from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{from the}} Apollo 17 mission {{shows that the}} massifs {{surrounding}} the valley <b>are</b> <b>composed</b> primarily of feldspar-rich breccia and that basalt underlies the valley floor, {{a result of the}} lava flows during the valley's history. Seismic studies suggest that the basalt below the valley floor is about 1400 metres (4593.2feet) thick. Above the layer of subfloor basalt lies a deposit of unconsolidated material of various compositions ranging from volcanic material to impact-formed regolith. The valley floor's unusually low albedo, or reflectivity, {{is a direct result of}} the volcanic material and glass beads located there. The deeper craters on the valley floor act as 'natural drill holes' and allowed the astronauts to sample the subfloor basalt. These basalt samples <b>are</b> <b>composed</b> primarily of plagioclase, but also contain amounts of clinopyroxene and other minerals.|$|E

5|$|Many {{proteins}} <b>are</b> <b>composed</b> {{of several}} protein domains, i.e. segments of a protein that fold into distinct structural units. Domains usually also have specific functions, such as enzymatic activities (e.g. kinase) or {{they serve as}} binding modules (e.g. the SH3 domain binds to proline-rich sequences in other proteins).|$|E

5|$|Scattered objects, {{like other}} trans-Neptunian objects, have low densities and <b>are</b> <b>composed</b> largely of frozen {{volatiles}} {{such as water}} and methane.

5|$|The Sun, which {{comprises}} {{nearly all}} the matter in the Solar System, is composed of roughly 98% hydrogen and helium. Jupiter and Saturn, which comprise {{nearly all the}} remaining matter, are also primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. A composition gradient exists in the Solar System, created by heat and light pressure from the Sun; those objects closer to the Sun, which are more affected by heat and light pressure, <b>are</b> <b>composed</b> of elements with high melting points. Objects farther from the Sun <b>are</b> <b>composed</b> largely of materials with lower melting points. The boundary in the Solar System beyond which those volatile substances could condense {{is known as the}} frost line, and it lies at roughly 5 AU from the Sun.|$|E
