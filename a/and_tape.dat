5|$|Rooted in the 1980s {{hardcore}} punk scene, Butthole Surfers {{quickly became}} {{known for their}} chaotic and disturbing live shows, black comedy, and a sound that incorporated elements of psychedelia, noise rock, punk and, later, electronica, {{as well as their}} use of sound manipulation <b>and</b> <b>tape</b> editing.|$|E
5|$|In Virginia, 125 {{planes were}} {{relocated}} from Langley Air Force Base to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. Roughly 400 people evacuated from coastal areas in Maryland, and stores in Ocean City reported {{a substantial increase}} in sales related to storm preparation. Further north in New Jersey, casinos prepared sandbags to protect the structures <b>and</b> <b>tape</b> to cover windows.|$|E
5|$|Lennon {{considered}} the song his greatest accomplishment. The track incorporates reverse-recorded instrumentation <b>and</b> <b>tape</b> loops, and was created from the editing together of two separate {{versions of the}} song – each one entirely different in tempo, mood and musical key. The song was later included on the US Magical Mystery Tour LP (although not on the British double EP package of the same name).|$|E

5|$|Spacecraft {{communications}} {{included a}} command subsystem operating at 154.2 and 2106.4MHz and a PCM narrow-band telemetry subsystem, operating at 2287.5 and 137.86MHz, for spacecraft housekeeping, attitude, and sensor performance data. Video {{data from the}} three-camera RBV system was transmitted in both real-time <b>and</b> <b>tape</b> recorder modes at 2265.5MHz, while information from the MSS was constrained to a 20MHz radio-frequency bandwidth at 2229.5MHz.|$|E
5|$|From 1963 to 1970, Kaegi {{worked at}} the Centre de Recherches Sonores, the electroacoustic music studio of Radio Suisse Romande in Geneva. There he started {{composing}} electronic <b>and</b> <b>tape</b> music, including pieces such as Éclipses (1964), L'Art de la Table (1964), and Entretiens (1965). At the C.R.S., Kaegi created several radiophonic works; such as La Porte Noire in 1964 and Zéa in 1965. In the late 1960s, Kaegi wrote several essays on electronic music, including the influential book Was ist elektronische Musik?, ("What Is Electronic Music?"), {{which was published in}} 1967 in Zurich, Switzerland, and also became a film for Swiss television.|$|E
5|$|The Nightfly debuted on Billboard Rock Albums chart {{at number}} 39 {{during the week}} ending October 23, 1982, peaking at number 25 on November 13. It debuted on the magazine's all-genre Top LPs <b>and</b> <b>Tape</b> chart on October 30 at number 45; it climbed to number 11, its peak, on November 27. It also charted on Billboard Black LPs chart, peaking at number 24. Internationally, the album charted higher: in Norway, it reached number seven on the charts. In Sweden and New Zealand, the album peaked at numbers eight and nine, respectively. The Nightfly {{performed}} poorer than Gaucho commercially; Fagen felt as though the label did not market the album properly or effectively. WBCN in Boston, inspired by the album cover, developed a promotion in which listeners could register to host their own radio show.|$|E

5|$|The 1980s saw the {{increased}} use of audio cassettes and videotapes for the dissemination of bootleg recordings, as the affordability of private dubbing equipment made the production of multiple copies significantly easier. Cassettes were also smaller, easier to ship, and could be sold or traded more affordably than vinyl. Cassette culture <b>and</b> <b>tape</b> trading, propelled by the DIY ethic of the punk subculture, relied on an honour system where people who received tapes from fellow traders made multiple copies to pass on to others within the community. For a while, stalls at major music gatherings such as the Glastonbury Festival sold mass copies of bootleg soundboard recordings of bands who, in many cases, had played only a matter of hours beforehand. However, officials soon began to counteract this illegal activity by making raids on the stalls and, {{by the end of the}} 1980s, the number of festival bootlegs had consequently dwindled.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} re-released in 1985 and 2002, earning another $60 million and $68 million respectively, for a {{worldwide}} total of $792 million with North America accounting for $435 million. It held the global record {{until it was}} surpassed by Jurassic Park—another Spielberg-directed film—in 1993, although it managed {{to hold on to}} the domestic record for a further four years, where a Star Wars reissue reclaimed it. It was eventually released on VHS and laserdisc on October 27, 1988; to combat piracy, the tapeguards <b>and</b> <b>tape</b> hubs on the videocassettes were colored green, the tape itself was affixed with a small, holographic sticker of the 1963 Universal logo (much like the holograms on a credit card), and encoded with Macrovision. In North America alone, VHS sales came to $75 million. In 1991, Sears began selling E.T. videocassettes exclusively at their stores as part of a holiday promotion. It was reissued on VHS and Laserdisc again in 1996. The Laserdisc included a 90-minute documentary. Produced and directed by Laurent Bouzereau, it included interviews with Spielberg, producer Kathleen Kennedy, composer John Williams and other cast and crew members. It also included two theatrical trailers, an isolated music score, deleted scenes, and still galleries. The VHS included a 10-minute version of the same documentary from the Laserdisc.|$|E
