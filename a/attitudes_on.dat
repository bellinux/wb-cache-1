5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, the British Admiralty {{maintained}} that naval defence of the British Empire, including the Dominions, should be unified under the Royal Navy. <b>Attitudes</b> <b>on</b> this matter softened during the first decade, and at the 1909 Imperial Conference, the Admiralty proposed the creation of Fleet Units: forces consisting of a battlecruiser, three light cruisers, six destroyers, and three submarines. While Australia and Canada were encouraged to purchase fleet units to serve as the core of new national navies, other fleet units would be operated by the Royal Navy at distant bases, particularly in the Far East; New Zealand was asked to partially subsidise a fleet unit for the China Station.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Rob LaZebnik, {{inspired}} by when his teenage son came out. Critical reception was mixed: the emotionally touching aspects of LaZebnik's script and Harry Shearer's portrayal of Smithers were praised. However, criticisms included the plot possibly ending the innuendo-driven humor involving Smithers' secret love of Burns, and an assumption that the character was being retconned due to changing <b>attitudes</b> <b>on</b> homosexuality since the series' debut. The episode was covered by international media.|$|E

25|$|The Vanport Flood {{parallels}} {{the more recent}} Hurricane Katrina disaster in New Orleans. In both cases, public officials led the population {{to believe that the}} damage would be slight, and in both cases the government response to the disaster was harshly criticized. Critics attributed the poor response, in both cases, to racist <b>attitudes</b> <b>on</b> the part of officials, who allegedly neglected to respond appropriately to the destruction of predominately black communities. However, many dispute the role of racism, pointing to the transformation of Vanport by the influx of World WarII veterans and their families and official commitment to the area shown by the establishment at Vanport of the only state college in the greater Portland metropolitan area.|$|E
25|$|Many gay men {{and lesbians}} took the first steps into {{constructing}} a political movement of their own. In the 1950s, a group of male homosexuals created a group called, The Mattachine Society in Los Angeles. Their mission was to first create an analysis of homosexuals as an oppressed minority, then start to build a large movement of the homosexual community working towards full sovereignty. As the group became larger, the branch moved itself to San Francisco and started its own newspaper called, Mattachine Review. In San Francisco, they began educating professionals-doctors, lawyers, teachers-who heavily influenced public opinion. In teaching homosexuality as an issue of prejudice and discrimination, they hoped to change anti-gay <b>attitudes</b> <b>on</b> a global scale.|$|E

25|$|To {{illustrate}} this relationship, Giddens discusses changing attitudes towards marriage in developed countries. He claims that {{any effort to}} explain this phenomenon solely in terms of micro or macro level causes {{will result in a}} circular cause and consequence. Social relationships and visible sexuality (micro-level change) are related to the decline of religion and the rise of rationality (macro-level change), but also with changes in the laws relating to marriage and sexuality (macro), change caused by different practices and changing <b>attitudes</b> <b>on</b> the level of everyday lives (micro). Practices and attitudes in turn can be affected by social movements (for example, women's liberation and egalitarianism), a macro-scale phenomena; but the movements usually grow out of everyday life grievances — a micro-scale phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|During those years, Pântea {{also became}} {{an active member}} of the Bucharest Bessarabian Circle of Nicolae Bosie-Codreanu, which {{monitored}} the evolution of Soviet <b>attitudes</b> <b>on</b> Romania. By then, there was a visible rapprochement between the Romania and the Soviet Union, effected by Romania's Foreign Minister Nicolae Titulescu and his PNL faction. The two governments had signed the London Convention for the Definition of Aggression and resumed diplomatic contacts. Renewing his attempts to obtain a definitive Romanian–Soviet agreement on Bessarabia, Pântea had informal talks with Mikhail Ostrovsky, the Soviet Envoy to Bucharest. Pântea preserved the image of a philo-Romanian Ostrovsky, who believed that Stalin would in time accept the union; the initiative, however, came to nothing, as both Ostrovsky and Titulescu were sidelined by their respective governments.|$|E

The Easterners were once again divided into the Northern and the Southern Faction. Yu Seong-ryong led the Southern faction while the Northerners divided even further after arguments over many issues; the Greater Northerners Faction was an extreme leftist faction, while the Lesser Northerners Faction became less reform-minded than the Greater Northerners Faction, but still more leftist than the Southerners.|$|E

25|$|The {{unit was}} unique, {{being the only}} Indigenous Australian {{battalion}} ever formed by the Australian Army, and although {{a number of small}} irregular units of Aborigines were formed to provide surveillance of isolated parts of the northern Australian coast, the majority of Indigenous Australians that enlisted during the war served in integrated units, with the exigencies of wartime emergency resulting in significant changes both to official policy and social <b>attitudes</b> <b>on</b> the service of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in the military. The Torres Strait Island Light Infantry Battalion represented a significant contribution to the Australian war effort in terms of population, with the majority of able bodied Torres Strait Islander males of military age serving during the war.

25|$|Prior to the Second World War, {{conventional}} wisdom throughout {{the majority of}} the aviation industry was that manned flight at supersonic speeds, those in excess of the sound barrier, was next to impossible, mainly due to the apparently insurmountable issue of compressibility. During the 1930s, few researchers and aerospace engineers chose to explore the field of high speed fluid dynamics; notable pioneers in this area were the German aerospace engineer Adolf Busemann, British physicist Sir Geoffrey Taylor, and British engine designer Sir Stanley Hooker. While Germany gave considerable attention to exploring and implementing Busemann's theories on the swept wing and its role in drag-reduction during high speed flight, both Britain and the United States overlooked this research on the whole. It was only by 1944 that information regarding the rocket-propelled Messerschmitt Me 163 or the jet-propelled Me 262, both having been equipped with swept wings, did wider <b>attitudes</b> <b>on</b> its merits begin to change. Prior to this point, the British Air Ministry had already launched a research programme of its own.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} research {{in recent times}} {{on the role of}} cognitive variables among the set of factors that can lead to rape. A detailed conceptual analysis shows that objectification might underlie denial of agency and personhood that leads to rape. Sexually violent men {{have been shown to be}} more likely to consider victims responsible for the rape and are less knowledgeable about the impact of rape on victims. Such men may misread cues given out by women in social situations and may lack the inhibitions that act to suppress associations between sex and aggression. They may have coercive sexual fantasies, and overall are more hostile towards women than are men who are not sexually violent. In addition to these factors, sexually violent men are believed to differ from other men in terms of impulsivity and antisocial tendencies. They also tend to have an exaggerated sense of masculinity. Sexual violence is also associated with a preference for impersonal sexual relationships as opposed to emotional bonding, with having many sexual partners and with the inclination to assert personal interests at the expense of others. A further association is with adversarial <b>attitudes</b> <b>on</b> gender, that hold that women are opponents to be challenged and conquered.|$|E
