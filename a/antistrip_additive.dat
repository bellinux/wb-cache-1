40|$|Moisture {{damage or}} {{stripping}} is an asphalt pavement distress that is generally {{recognized as the}} loss of the bond between the asphalt binder and the aggregate. Several pavement distresses that can include stripping as the underlying cause are rutting, cracking, raveling, flushing, and bleeding. Stripping can progress from either the top or bottom of hot mix pavement layer. The common cause in all cases of stripping is the presence of water. The potential for a hot mix asphalt pavement to incur moisture damage can be controlled or reduced through material selection, mixture designs that include a high asphalt film thickness, additives, proper pavement design, construction, compaction, and drainage. Many agencies include moisture sensitivity testing in the asphalt mixture design stage. The outcome of this testing can be used to eliminate certain asphalt and aggregate combinations or to require the use of an <b>antistrip</b> <b>additive.</b> The most commonly used antistrip additives are hydrated lime and liquid chemical additives. The moisture sensitivity test procedure recommended in the SHRP SuperPave mixture design protocol is AASHTO T- 283, “Resistance of Compacted Bituminous Mixture to Moisture Induced Damage”. The purpose of this research is to determine if hydrated lime and high performance chemical additives perform similarly using AASHTO T- 283 as the prediction model for the moisture sensitivity of a hot mix asphalt mixture. In this research, the optional freeze cycle was incorporated in the test method in order to increase the potential for moisture damage to occur to the specimens. This was done to distinguish high performing, no additive mixtures and also at the recommendation of McGennis and Aschenbrener that high traffic and severity one pavement mix designs should include it (1). An additional purpose of this research was to determine the effective dosage concentrations for the liquid chemical additives...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{testing of}} {{hot mix asphalt}} (HMA) in order to {{evaluate}} moisture susceptibility has improved {{over the past several}} decades. Within the past eight years, the Hamburg wheel-tracking device (HWTD) has been used in evaluating HMA for moisture susceptibility. There are no standard test methods or specifications established for this testing device. This study evaluated the repeatability of the test, testing configuration, test temperature, and capability to evaluate effects of <b>antistripping</b> <b>additives</b> in HMA. The HWTD has shown to be repeatable where six replicate tests provided consistent test results. The device yielded repeatable results for mixtures produced with different aggregates and with test specimens fabricated by different compacting devices. The conventional testing configuration was altered such that cylindrical test specimens fabricated with a Superpave gyratory compactor (SGC) could be used in lieu of rectangular slabs. Results indicate that cylindrical specimens compacted with the SGC could be used for moisture evaluation in the HWTD for comparative evaluation of one material to another...|$|R
40|$|Freeze-thaw (FT) {{cycles and}} {{moisture}} susceptibility are important factors influencing the geotechnical characteristics of soil-aggregates. Given {{the lack of}} published information {{on the behavior of}} cement-bitumen emulsion-treated base (CBETB) under environmental conditions, especially freezing and thawing, this study investigated the effects of these additives on the CBETB performance. The primary goal was to evaluate the resistance of CBETB to moisture damage by performing FT, Marshall conditioning, and AASHTO T- 283 tests and to evaluate the long-term stripping susceptibility of CBETB while also predicting the liquid <b>antistripping</b> <b>additives</b> to assess the mixture’s durability and workability. Specimens were stabilized with Portland cement (0 %– 6 %), bitumen emulsion (0 %– 5 %), and Portland cement-bitumen emulsion mixtures and cured for 7 days, and their short- and long-term performances were studied. Evaluation results of both the Marshall stability ratio and the tensile strength ratio show that the additions of additives increase the resistance of the mixtures to moisture damage. Results of durability tests performed for determining the resistance of compacted specimens to repeated FT cycles indicate that the specimen with the 4 % cement- 3 % bitumen emulsion mixture significantly improves water absorption, volume changes, and weight losses. This indicates the effectiveness of this additive as a road base stabilizer with excellent engineering properties for cold regions...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1990 Moisture {{damage has}} long been {{recognized}} as one of the most critical factors influencing the performance of asphalt concrete (AC) pavements. This moistureinduced damage occurs from either the physical separation of the asphalt film from the aggregate or the softening of the asphalt binder within the AC mixture in the presence of water. This phenomenon is often termed stripping. Although many test procedures have been developed over the years to identify stripping potential of AC mixtures, none have received wide acceptance by the engineering profession. The purpose of this research was to develop a standard test procedure that will allow for a quantitative means of predicting moisture susceptibility of AC mixtures and provide for an assessment on the effectiveness of <b>antistripping</b> <b>additives.</b> The measure of response made in this study was the resilient modulus obtained from a pneumatic repeatedload test system. Dense graded, laboratorycompacted test specimens fabricated from two aggregate sources in the state of Oregon were evaluated in this research. The test procedure and specimen preparation developed was implemented with a saturation and freezethaw moisture condition cycling. Results indicate that the procedure can significantly differentiate between a proven stripping aggregate and a proven non stripping aggregate. The comparison can be made following full saturation plus one freezethaw cycle. Results also indicate that caution must be used when comparing mixes of different air void contents. The results of the procedure developed appear to over predict moisture susceptibility of low air void groups (< 6. 5...|$|R
40|$|Shape, gradation, {{hardness}} {{and texture}} {{are among the}} aggregate characteristics necessary to consider during the asphalt mixture design process. However these characteristics do not provide direct information on the compatibility between the aggregate and the bitumen, nor do they give any indication on how this compatibility evolves when other factors as water, additives and other chemicals interact with the mixture. Other aspects, such as aggregate chemistry, can also significantly affect the asphalt durability influencing the affinity between aggregate and bitumen and thus also the service life of the mixture. This study aims to investigate how the mineralogy of the aggregates affects the bitumen-aggregate system in different conditions. After selecting four different aggregate types and one neat binder, laboratory tests on both uncompacted and compacted mixtures were carried out {{in order to identify}} one or more minerals affecting the pavement service life. Abrasion and moisture sensitivity tests were used to evaluate how the environment affects the bitumenaggregate interaction and to establish a basis for comparison. De-icing agents and anti-stripping additives were later added to the system to investigate how the mixture performance would evolve. Quartz, alibite and microcline content were observed to negatively affect the mixture performance in all conditions affecting both the bitumen-aggregate system in terms of adhesion resistance and the binder in terms of cohesion and rheological properties. The mixtures containing aggregates with high alibite and quartz content were also the most readily affected by de-icing solutions although the samples performance was largely dependent on the concentration of the de-icer. When <b>antistripping</b> <b>additives</b> are incorporated in the mixture, their efficiency is largely dependent on the mixing technique and the test method rather than the mixture components...|$|R
40|$|Moisture {{damage in}} asphalt {{pavement}} {{has always been}} a problem for drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate moisture susceptibility of Hot-Mix Asphalt (HMA) and to investigate mitigation techniques using different antistripping agents. Three types of antistripping agents were used in this research investigation. Two of which are chemical based and the other is hydrated lime. The two types of liquid antistripping agents used in this study include Arr Maz CC LOF- 6500 and Arr Maz CC XL- 9000. These two liquid antistripping agents were tested at 0. 25 %, 0. 50 %, and 0. 75 %. Hydrated Lime was tested at 1. 0 %, 1. 5 %, and 2. 0 %. The binder used in this study is Asphalt Performance Grade (PG) 64 - 16 provided by Oxnard Refinery. The crushed stone aggregate used in this study was provided by Cal Portland. This study follows the guidelines of standardized AASHTO, ASTM, and SuperPave mix design for all preparation and test procedures. A total of 120 4 -inch by 2. 83 -inch core specimens with void ratios between 6 to 8 percent were created to test for moisture susceptibility in accordance with the Modified Lottman Test, which tested for Indirect Tensile Strength and Immersion Compression Test, which tested for Compression Strength and Elasticity. During the test, half of these specimens were placed in a hot water bath for 24 hours to condition the sample to represent field performance and the other half were unconditioned. Based on the results, the best liquid antistripping agent is XL- 9000 at 0. 50 % and hydrated lime is most efficient at a dosage rate of 1. 5 %. The best performing <b>antistripping</b> <b>additive</b> for the value is hydrated lime at 1. 5 %...|$|R
