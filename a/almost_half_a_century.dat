Hay was also an author and biographer and wrote poetry and other literature throughout much of his life.|$|E
5|$|On {{a single}} day in 1825, 23 ships were left {{stranded}} off the coast. In 1833, Martinus Rørbye became the first artist to paint the fishermen and landscapes of Skagen, <b>almost</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> {{before the arrival of}} the Skagen Painters. Skagen Church was inaugurated in 1841, and the first guest house in the town opened in 1844. In 1858, the grey lighthouse was inaugurated. The same year, bye-laws were established specifying building requirements including the completion of tiled roofs within five years. Skagen was struck by the cholera epidemic of 1853.|$|E

His avocations were farming and rowing. He was founder of the Chesapeake Boat Club, where he assembled an all-Pi Kappa Alpha crew. For twenty years, Tazewell was on the Norfolk City Council. He had been asked to run for mayor, but he declined.|$|R
50|$|Forest and tundra {{reclaimed}} the Iditarod Trail for <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> until Alaskans, led by Joe Redington, Sr., reopened the routes. To {{draw attention}} to the role dogs played in Alaska's history, Redington and his friends created an epic sled dog race from Anchorage to Nome. The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race ultimately revived dog mushing in Alaska and around the world. After years of effort by Redington and the Alaska Congressional delegation, the Iditarod was designated as a National Historic Trail in 1978.|$|R

Father Chichester was named the first Archbishop of Salisbury in 1955 and was also Titular Bishop of Ubaza. He {{attended}} the Second Vatican Council's first session as a Council Father. He died on 24 October 1962, aged 83, while attending the Council after collapsing {{on the steps of}} St Peter's Basilica.

5|$|A {{different}} {{school of}} thought developed <b>almost</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> later, with palaeontologist David Weishampel suggesting that the skeletons from the lower layers stemmed from a herd that died catastrophically in a mudflow, while those in the upper layers accumulated over time. Weishampel explained the curious monospecific assemblage by theorizing that Plateosaurus were common during this period. This theory was erroneously attributed to Seemann in a popular account of the plateosaurs {{in the collection of}} the Institute and Museum for Geology and Palaeontology, University of Tübingen, and has since become the standard explanation on most internet sites and in popular books on dinosaurs. Rieber proposed a more elaborate scenario, which included the animals dying of thirst or starvation, and being concentrated by mudflows.|$|E
5|$|The Bruneian Empire was {{established}} in the coastal regions of Sarawak by the mid-15th century, and the Kuching area was known to Portuguese cartographers during the 16th century as Cerava, one of the five great seaports of Borneo. It was also during this time that witnessed the birth of the Sultanate of Sarawak, a local kingdom that lasted for <b>almost</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> before being reunited with Brunei in 1641. By the early 19th century, the Bruneian Empire was in decline, retaining only a tenuous hold along the coastal regions of Sarawak which were otherwise controlled by semi-independent Malay leaders. Away from the coast, territorial wars were fought between the Iban and a Kenyah-Kayan alliance.|$|E

The Winter Gardens complex is home to the Malvern Theatres, a cinema, a concert venue/banqueting room, bars and cafeterias. For <b>almost</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century,</b> the Malvern Winter Gardens has also been a leisure centre and a major regional venue for classical music, and concerts by major rock bands of the 60s, 70s and 80s.

40|$|The {{standard}} Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is simple, intuitive, and {{grounded in}} sound economic theory. Yet, <b>almost</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century’s</b> worth of empirical testing {{has so far}} failed to demonstrate its relevance. One major reason given for the CAPM’s empirical failure is that beta is not the sole measure of systematic risk. In other words, the standard CAPM does not hold. Another important {{explanation is that the}} CAPM may hold conditionally rather than unconditionally. The standard CAPM fails to explain the cross-section of returns because it ignores the fact that both the risk and the price of risk are time-varying. The search for conditional models has led researchers to either disregard the theory behind the CAPM or to use statistical procedures that are too complex to be replicated by other researchers and practitioners. In this paper we propose a conditional model that is compatible with the standard CAPM while remaining simple and accessible to both researchers and practitioners. Beta and the risk premium are assumed to be time-varying, with the latter being associated with bull and bear states. We find strong support for the conditional CAPM with beta explaining both bull and bear markets. While the bear market ex-post risk premium is negative, the weighted average risk premium is positive and highly significant...|$|R
40|$|When Walter Dyk {{published}} Son of Old Man Hat in 1938, {{he introduced}} {{most of the}} world to a remarkable youth: Left Handed of the Bitahni clan, adopted son of Old Man Hat. That classic anthropological autobiography was the story of a child, born before his time, who grew to be a humorous, sensitive and observant young man. Left Handed dictated this story, which he concluded with his marriage, <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> after most of the events had occurred. Following the Second World War, Dyk returned to the Navajo Reservation {{for the rest of the}} story and found Left Handed 2 ̆ 7 s memory as bright as ever, and his bafflement, even anxiety, about relationships with women still the dominant theme of his recollected life. Nearly eighty, the old man narrated a story so rich in detail (especially since he was able to recall conversations almost verbatim) and so rooted in the texture of late nineteenth century reservation life, that the present volume of almost 600 pages encompasses barely three years...|$|R

25|$|Codified in 1859, Australian {{football}} {{had been}} played by men for <b>almost</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> {{before the first}} women's football matches were played. Contact sports such as football were widely considered unsuitable for women at the time, and public attitudes prevented them from participating in organised matches. Exceptions included charity matches, such as patriotic fundraisers, which occasionally featured women players. Women have nonetheless followed the Australian game passionately since the mid-19th century, comprising approximately 50% of spectators at matches—a uniquely high figure among football codes.|$|E

All of them ultimately failed, yet most notable were those led by Lý Bôn and Triệu Quang Phục, whose Early Lý dynasty ruled for <b>almost</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century,</b> from 544 to 602, before Sui China reconquered their kingdom Vạn Xuân.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} <b>almost</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> later that a non-injected {{formulation}} of progesterone was marketed.

OMP was finally marketed in France under the brand name Utrogestan in 1980, and this was followed by the introduction of OMP in the United States under the brand name Prometrium in 1998. In the early 1990s, vaginal micronized progesterone (brand names Crinone, Utrogestan, Endometrin) was also marketed.|$|E
