5|$|Peace between England and the Netherlands in 1688 {{meant that}} the two {{countries}} entered the Nine Years' War as allies, but the conflict—waged in Europe and overseas between France, Spain and the Anglo-Dutch alliance—left the English a stronger colonial power than the Dutch, who were forced to devote <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> their military budget on the costly land war in Europe. The 18th century saw England (after 1707, Britain) rise to be the world's dominant colonial power, and France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, in 1942 the Australian {{military}} {{was reinforced by}} units recalled from the Middle East and {{an expansion of the}} Militia and RAAF. United States military units also arrived in Australia in great numbers before being deployed to New Guinea, and in April 1942 command of Australian and US forces in the South West Pacific was consolidated under an American commander, General Douglas MacArthur. After halting the Japanese the Allies moved onto the offensive in late 1942, with the pace of advance accelerating in 1943. From 1944 the Australian {{military was}} mainly relegated to subsidiary roles in holding or mopping-up operations, but continued to conduct large-scale operations {{until the end of the}} war with <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> its forces deployed in the final months of the conflict than at any other time.|$|E

5|$|By 1675 the Swedish fleet was numerically {{superior}} to its Danish counterpart (18 ships of the line against 16, 21 frigates against 11), but the Swedish ships were generally older and of poorer quality than the Danish, which had replaced <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> its vessels with more modern warships. The Swedish side also had problems with routine maintenance, and both rigging and sails were generally in poor condition. Swedish crews lacked the level of professionalism of Danish and Norwegian sailors, who often had experience from service in the Dutch merchant navy, and the Swedish Navy lacked a core of professional officers while the Danish had seasoned veterans like Cort Adeler and Nils Juel. The Danish fleet was reinforced with Dutch units under Philip van Almonde and Cornelis Tromp, the latter an experienced officer who had served under Michiel de Ruyter.|$|E

5|$|Not every {{scene was}} {{performed}} live; {{because of the}} increased budget — £7,552 was spent on the serial, nearly double the amount spent on The Quatermass Experiment — Cartier was able to include <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> pre-filmed inserts on 35mm film, which were included during the live transmissions of each episode. Most of the pre-filmed material was shot on location at the Shell Haven oil refinery in Stanford-le-Hope, doubling for the factory where the alien creature is being grown on Earth. Filming also took place in rural Essex for material showing the meteorites being discovered in fields, and in the boiler rooms of the under-construction BBC Television Centre in London for scenes set inside the factory. The location film sequences were the most ambitious that had then been attempted in British television drama, which was usually predominantly studio-bound.|$|E

5|$|The Bismarcks' use of four twin turrets (the 4 × 2 configuration) was {{a design}} {{practice}} that hearkened {{back to the}} First World War. Almost all other post-1921 capital ships had triple or even quadruple turrets, which allowed for additional heavy caliber guns, while {{reducing the number of}} turrets. Fewer turrets reduced the length of the battleship's armored citadel (particularly magazine length and the armor needed to protect it) and shortened the vessel itself. Although triple turrets were considered for the Bismarcks, there were concerns that the extra barrel would lower the overall rate of fire in each turret, along with fears that a single well-aimed hit could disable <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> the ship's firepower. It was also felt that four twin turrets allowed for a better field of fire and a more effective sequence of salvoes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the legions {{underwent}} these transformations, the auxilia were reorganized and a number of allied troops were formalised into standing units similar to legions. Rather than being raised re-actively when required, the process of raising auxiliary troops was carried out in advance of conflicts according to annual targets. Whereas the internal organisation of the auxilia had previously been left up to their commanders, in the early empire they were organised into standardised units known as turmae (for cavalry alae) and centuriae (for infantry cohortes). Although never becoming as standardised in their equipment as the legions, and often retaining some national flavour, the size of the units at least was standardised to some degree. Cavalry were formed into either an ala quingenaria of 512 horsemen, or an ala millaria of 1,000 horsemen. Likewise, infantry auxilia could be formed into a cohors quingenaria of 500 men or a cohors millaria of 1,000 men. Mixed cavalry/infantry auxiliaries were typically formed with <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> foot than horse troops: the cohors equitata quingenaria consisted of 380 foot and 120 horsemen, and the cohors equitata millaria consisted of 760 foot and 240 horsemen.|$|E

25|$|Napoleon {{determined}} {{to replace the}} 4-pounder with the heavier 6-pounder by using {{the large number of}} Austrian and Prussian cannons captured in 1794–1800.

In 1803 with the Year XI system, France began to manufacture new 6-pounder and 12-pounder cannons and 5½-inch and 6⅓-inch howitzers. The new system was only partly implemented by 1809. In that year, the 4-pounders were reassigned to the infantry battalions.|$|E
