40|$|This paper {{describes}} CA/C++, Concurrency Annotations in C++, {{a language}} extension that regulates method invocations from multiple threads of execution in a shared-memory multiprocessor system. This system provides threads as an orthogonal element to the language, {{allowing them to}} travel through more than one object. Statically type-ckecked synchronous and asynchronous method invocations are supported, with return values from asynchronous invocations accessed through first class future-like objects. Method invocations are regulated with synchronization code defined in a separate class hierarchy, allowing separate definition and inheritance of synchronization mechanisms. Each method is protected by an <b>access</b> <b>flag</b> that can be switched in pre and post-actions, and by a predicate. Both must evaluate to true in order to enable a thread to animate the method code. Flags and method predicates are independently redefinable along the inheritance chain, thus avoiding the inheritance anomaly. [...] ...|$|E

5000|$|Unix file {{descriptors}} {{behave in}} many ways as capabilities. They can be passed between processes across Unix domain sockets using the sendmsg (...) system call. Note, however, that what is actually passed is a reference to an [...] "open file description" [...] that has mutable state (the file offset, and the file status and <b>access</b> <b>flags).</b> This complicates the secure use of file descriptors as capabilities, since when programs share {{access to the same}} open file description, they can interfere with each other's use of it by changing its offset or whether it is blocking or non-blocking, for example. In operating systems that are specifically designed as capability systems, there is very rarely any mutable state associated with a capability itself.|$|R

50|$|Since the {{majority}} of content provided by companies like BSkyB requires subscription, VideoGuard protects that content by encrypting both standard subscription channels and pay-per-view movies and events. <b>Access</b> <b>flags</b> can be downloaded to the subscriber's card either over the air (via 'hidden' data streams) or by using the box's built in modem, thereby allowing rapid changing of channel packages and ordering of events. Already in use in America since 1997, the VideoGuard system {{was introduced to the}} UK by NDS in 1998 with the launch of Sky Digital, replacing the VideoCrypt system (also supplied by NDS) in use on Sky's analogue broadcasts. Despite widespread piracy of the US DirecTV service between 1997 and 2002, the implementation in the UK remained secure until 2014 when a BBC investigation revealed that some companies in south London offered pirated Sky TV sold for Â£10 a month. The BBC report quoted Keith Cottenden, forensic services director at consultants Cy4or, said in February 2014 that there were some areas in the UK where those hacking satellite TV outnumber viewers paying for it legitimately.|$|R

Split-word arithmetic is used in performing arithmetic operations on both halves of a split word at the same time. A split word on the D-17B consists of 11 bits. Minimized access timing is the placing of instructions and data in memory {{so that they are}} available with minimum delay from the disk memory.|$|R

For example, on the Macintosh IIci and later machines, HLock (...) and other APIs was rewritten to implement handle locking in a way other than flagging the high bits of handles. But, many Macintosh application programmers {{and a great deal of}} the Macintosh system software code itself <b>accessed</b> the <b>flags</b> directly rather than using the APIs, such as HLock (...) , which had been provided to manipulate them.

Denying market <b>access</b> to the <b>flag</b> {{of convenience}} fishing fleet should significantly reduce instances of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.

40|$|While {{there have}} been {{substantial}} benefits to fish trade and the fishing industry from the opening up of markets, deregulation and greater flexibility in how and where companies can operate, this may {{have come at a}} significant cost when it comes to managing fish stocks sustainably. Globalization has facilitated the catching, processing and marketing of fish however we frequently have little or no idea where the fish was caught, how sustainable the catch is, and where it has been before it enters the final market. Fisheries management by its very nature requires significant regulation. Regulation is aimed at addressing market failure. Well-resourced domestic fisheries management will result in sustainable fisheries and agreed environmental outcomes. Catches from the high seas present a vastly more complex picture. Despite attempts over many years to manage high seas stocks the record is not good. Globalization has in many cases facilitated the development and use of loopholes in international arrangements providing <b>access</b> to <b>flag</b> States who are not party to key agreements and allowing companies to set up in these countries often with little or no transparency. This environment presents a significant policy challenge for fisheries managers and the international community. How do we get economics to reinforce the fisheries management arrangements we need? There are significant policy gaps which need to be explored and responses developed. It may be time for a significant shift in thinking about the rights and responsibilities of those who access fishery resources...|$|R
30|$|The Internet {{has changed}} the way people engage in many activities, {{including}} gambling. Online gambling (compared with land-based gambling) provides players with ease of access, 24 / 7 accessibility, and confidentialityâall within the comfort of a personâs home. This ease of <b>access</b> has been <b>flagged</b> as a potential concern among researchers, regulators, and policy makers alike (Gainsbury 2015; Gainsbury and Wood 2011; RÃ¤sÃ¤nen et al. 2013). Specifically, online gambling is often framed as a âriskyâ form of gambling that may heighten {{the risk of developing}} a gambling disorder (Gainsbury et al. 2015 b; Griffiths et al. 2009; McBride and Derevensky 2009; Olason et al. 2011; Wood et al. 2007). In this light, it may be informative to examine factors that propel young adults to gamble online, including the link between social casino gaming and online gambling. This is because there is increasing evidence of the role played by social casino games in precipitating online gambling (Wohl et al. 2017) and young adults are increasingly exposed to social casino games (Kim et al. 2016).|$|R
