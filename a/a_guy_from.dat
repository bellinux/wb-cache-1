He tweeted, [...] "Choked on my cornflakes when I heard [...] new Chris Brown single this morning. Do {{you know what}} I mean?" [...] After receiving many abusive messages from Brown's fans after posting the comment, he later tweeted, [...] "I don't care that you call me a nobody.

500|$|Although the Daddies were {{experiencing}} commercial success {{under the guise}} of swing revivalists, having been declared the [...] "leaders" [...] of the movement by Rolling Stone, the band openly contested being labeled a retro act at the exclusion of their dominant ska and punk influences and modernist lyricism. While still vocal supporters of both the swing revival and its bands, the Daddies adamantly tried to disassociate themselves from the swing scene and in particular its nostalgia-based mentality. Perry explained to Spin in July 1998, [...] "it's not our mission to be a swing band. I'm not <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>from</b> the '40s. That's why we play ska and use heavy guitars", noting elsewhere [...] "I can't fully take us out of the retro classification, but we harp on the fact that we're contemporary music". Thusly, the Daddies avoided touring with swing bands, selecting Latin rock group Ozomatli and ska/soul band The Pietasters as support on their first headlining U.S. tour, and opening for Argentine rock band Los Fabulosos Cadillacs on their 1998 North American tour. At one point, the Daddies attempted to arrange a tour with Primus which never materialized; said Perry, [...] "I know there are people who come to our shows who'd like nothing more than for us to play swing 24/7...there are plenty of bands who want to be swing bands and swing bands only. We're trying to find the audience who'll let us write songs and just be who we are".|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Soldier" [...] is a {{continuation}} of the previous song on Destiny Fulfilled, [...] "Lose My Breath". As the singers feel that their man does not fulfill them in the way they want, they tell him [...] "I need a soldier", further [...] "upping their standards". They request their man to be a [...] "", proclaiming their love for [...] "country boys"; their preference include a [...] "soldier" [...] who is [...] "street" [...] and [...] "hood". MacPherson further felt that the trio cruised the ghetto for suitable men with [...] "Soldier", an [...] "ode to gangsta love". Corey Moss of MTV felt that the song {{was one of the most}} personal moments on Destiny Fulfilled in the sense that Beyoncé's then-relatively secret relationship with rapper Jay-Z was acknowledged [...] "on record for the first time". Moss further elaborated, [...] "Albeit minor, her [...] verse (about falling for <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>from</b> the BK, as in Jay's Brooklyn stomping grounds) offers a rare moment of commentary on the couple, which has thus far only been chronicled by tabloid photographers." [...] The song opens with T.I. rhyming lines and glorifying the profound love [...] "between a thug and a thugette". As the song progresses, each member of Destiny's Child describes their own favorite type of man, later harmonizing together for the chorus. Midway through the song, Lil Wayne's verse contains a reference to rapper B.G.. Williams is the last artist to sing her solo lines, which were described as [...] "the sexiest" [...] by Rashod Ollisong of The Baltimore Sun.|$|E

I'm just <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>from</b> a band, and I think Death is a metal band." [...] Schuldiner was ranked No. 10 in Joel McIver's book The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists in 2009 and No. 20 in March 2004 Guitar World's [...] "The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists".

2500|$|Death is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most influential bands in heavy metal and a pioneering force in death metal. Scream Bloody Gore is widely regarded as the first death metal album, and Schuldiner is acknowledged as the originator of extreme metal. Music biographer Garry Sharpe-Young considered Death [...] "a genre-breaking band centered upon frontman Chuck Schuldiner" [...] and that the band [...] "would become one of the prime instigators of the death metal movement". However, Schuldiner dismissed such attributions by stating, in an interview with Metal-Rules.com, [...] "I don't think I should take the credits for this death metal stuff. I'm just <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>from</b> a band, and I think Death is a metal band". In Death's later music, the band's music became more technical, moving to a more technical death metal style. In January 2001, Mahyar Dean, an Iranian musician, wrote Death, a book about Death and Schuldiner and released it in Iran. The book includes bilingual lyrics and many articles about the band. The book was sent through the site keepers of emptywords.org to Schuldiner, who in his words was [...] "truly blown away and extremely honored by the obvious work and devotion he put into bringing the book to life".|$|E

The family angle just evolved ... first Bill and me, then Bill me and Barry, then Bill, me, Barry and John, then Bill, me, Barry, John and Mom, then Bill, me, Barry, John, Mom and Paul, then later, me, Paul, John, Barry, Mom and Susan, then back to Bill, me, Barry and John (very briefly in the end) and then to me, Paul, John and Susan. Our first real break came when we were playing the MK Hotel in Newport (in the basement there) and <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>from</b> the [...] "Today Show" [...] saw us and asked if we wanted to be on the [...] "Today" [...] show.

Mercury dropped us, but Artie and Steve had written [...] "The Rain, The Park and Other Things" [...] and we went in and recorded that song at A studios in New York and took the whole package to MGM, who decided wouldn't it just be terrific if their mother performed with them and, voila, the rest, as they say, is history.|$|E
