40|$|Past {{studies of}} {{hydrogen}} cycling in hypersaline microbial mats have shown an active nighttime cycle, with production largely from Cyanobacteria and consumption from sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). However, the mechanisms {{and magnitude of}} hydrogen cycling have not been extensively studied. Two mats types near Guerrero Negro, Mexico [...] permanently submerged Microcoleus microbial mats (GN-S), and intertidal Lyngbya microbial mats (GN-I) [...] were used in microcosm diel manipulation experiments with 3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea (DCMU), <b>molybdate,</b> <b>ammonium</b> addition, and physical disruption to understand the processes responsible for hydrogen cycling between mat microbes. Across microcosms, H 2 production occurred under dark anoxic conditions with simultaneous production of a suite of organic acids. H 2 production was not significantly affected by inhibition of nitrogen fixation, but rather appears to result from constitutive fermentation of photosynthetic storage products by oxygenic phototrophs.

This method was then used, {{in conjunction with}} a novel in situ method to obtain highly dispersed PtMoz supported on α- MoC(1 -x), to explore the suitability of such materials as catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). Mg 2 (Mo 3 O 8) and Zn 2 (Mo 3 O 8), alternative tetravalent Mo intermediates to MoO 2, were obtained through the thermal decomposition of Mg(MoO 4) and Zn(MoO 4) in mixtures of CO and H 2. A novel sacrificial support method was developed where MgO and ZnO were investigated sacrificial support materials formed in situ as decomposition products of the Mo precursor. Reaction conditions were explored: including feed composition, synthesis temperature, and synthesis duration. X-Ray powder diffraction (XRD) was used to determine the time dependence on conversion, where 30 to 140 minutes at a temperature of ~ 700 °C was required to reach full conversion of the precursors. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed an equiaxed microstructure with primary particle sizes between approximately 15 - 30 nm, depending on the duration of high temperature exposure. Rapid heating rates along with limited exposure to high temperature required by this method resulted in gravimetric surface areas as high 45 m 2 /g, measured using four point Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. A similar, ammonia-free, synthesis of β-MoN(1 -x) in mixtures of N 2 and H 2 is also described. The ability of these precursors to be decomposed rapidly, in comparison to the time requirements for TPR, was utilized in the development of an in situ method for the preparation of PtMoz composite phases supported on α-MoC(1 -x). <b>Ammonium</b> magnesium <b>molybdate,</b> (NH 4) 2 Mg(MoO 4) 2, was developed as a precursor to α-MoC(1 -x) which was found to form favorable interactions with ammonium derived (PtCl 6) + 2 species when co-precipitated in NH 4 (OH). When this co-precipitated, and amorphous, precursor was treated under the carbiding conditions developed for the synthesis of α-MoC(1 -x), highly dispersed PtMoz on α-MoC(1 -x) was obtained. Crystalline platinum phases were not observed by XRD and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) revealed platinum phases with crystalline domains on the order of approximately 5 nm, homogeneously dispersed throughout the observed samples. The materials, as prepared, were found to be catalytically inert for ORR, leading to the development of an additional treatment designed to redistribute platinum phases in a manor conducive for yielding more labile surface species. In particular, it was found that a thermal treatment in a pure CO atmosphere directly following the initial material synthesis resulted in significant development of electrochemical surface area (ECSA). Materials were characterized using cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a rotating disc electrode setup. CV measurements were performed in both O 2 and N 2 saturated solutions of 0. 1 M HClO 4. The ECSA of this material was measured at ~ 36 m 2 /g and the specific mass activity for ORR was measured to be ~ 137 A/gpt. Catalyst durability measurements were also performed and the results are reported. The gravimetric surface area of the α-MoC(1 -x) support was measured using BET N 2 adsorption, measuring ~ 32 m 2 /g. The catalysts microstructure was also characterized using SEM. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed for the identification of various possible composite phases ranging from : α-Pt, α-PtMoz, β-Pt 3 Mo, and, α-(Pt 2 Mo 3 C) 0. 66. TEM results indicate a more broad distribution of these platinum phases, with the addition of what is likely β-MoC(1 -x), in the materials following the CO surface treatment.

Release of progesterone (P 4), estradiol (17 β-estradiol) and IGF-I by ovarian fragments was assessed by RIA. Data show that P 4 release by ovarian fragments was not affected by (NH 4) 6. Mo 7 O 24. 4 H 2 O addition at all the doses used (90 – 500 µg. ml- 1). However, addition of <b>ammonium</b> <b>molybdate</b> was found to cause a significant (P < 0. 05) dose-dependent decrease (at the doses 90, 170 and 500 µg. ml- 1) in release of 17 β-estradiol by ovarian fragments in comparison to control. Also, addition of <b>ammonium</b> <b>molybdate</b> significantly (P < 0. 05) inhibited IGF-I release at all the doses (90 – 500 µg. ml- 1) used in the study. Results suggest <b>ammonium</b> <b>molybdate</b> induced inhibition in the release of growth factor IGF-I and its dose-dependent effect on secretion of steroid hormone 17 β-estradiol but not progesterone. These data contribute to new insights regarding the mechanism of action of Mo on rat ovarian functions. Key word...|$|E
