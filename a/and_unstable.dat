5|$|Abbey of Our Lady (Vor Frue Kirke) was {{designed}} in 1878 by J.E. Gnudtzmann in the Neo-Romanesque style. The original Church of Our Lady {{from the early}} 12th century was pulled down after the Reformation because it was old <b>and</b> <b>unstable,</b> but the 12th-century tower and the original portal with sculpted decorations can still be seen. The carved pulpit dates to around 1581.|$|E
5|$|Abd al-Rahman at {{this time}} was a {{flamboyant}} figure with broad popular support. His stature served to diminish that of the politicians, who were seen as his followers rather than as leaders. Abd al-Rahman could not afford a sudden British withdrawal, since that would {{open the door for}} an Egyptian take-over and the loss of his power. The British also were against an Egyptian take-over, but for different reasons. Yet Abd al-Rahman could not be seen as supporting an indefinite colonial status, and continued to promote independence. Abd al-Rahman and the British were engaged in delicate <b>and</b> <b>unstable</b> arrangements characterized by mutual distrust.|$|E
5|$|Before {{settlers}} arrived, {{the land}} that became known as Forest Park was covered by a Douglas-fir forest. By 1851, its acreage had been divided into donation land claims filed by settlers with plans to clear the forest and build upon the property. After logging, the steep slopes <b>and</b> <b>unstable</b> silt loosened by heavy rains caused landslides that defeated construction plans, and claims were defaulted or donated to the city.|$|E

40|$|Nonlinear normal {{modes of}} a fixed-fixed buckled beam about its first post-buckling {{configuration}} are investigated. The cases of three-to-one and one-to-one internal resonances are analyzed. Approximate {{solutions for the}} nonlinear normal modes are computed by applying the method of multiple scales directly to the governing integral-partial-differential equation and associated boundary conditions. Curves displaying variation of the amplitude {{of one of the}} modes with the internal-resonance-detuning parameter are generated. It is shown that, for a three-to-one internal resonance between the first and third modes, the beam may possess one stable uncoupled mode (high-frequency mode) and either (a) one stable coupled mode, (b) three stable coupled modes, or (c) two stable <b>and</b> one <b>unstable</b> coupled modes. For the same resonance, the beam possesses one degenerate mode (with a multiplicity of two) and two stable <b>and</b> one <b>unstable</b> coupled modes. On the other hand, for a one-to-one internal resonance {{between the first and second}} modes, the beam possesses (a) two stable uncoupled modes and two stable <b>and</b> two <b>unstable</b> coupled modes; (b) one stable <b>and</b> one <b>unstable</b> uncoupled modes <b>and</b> two stable <b>and</b> two <b>unstable</b> coupled modes; <b>and</b> (c) two stable uncoupled <b>and</b> two <b>unstable</b> coupled modes (with a multiplicity of two). For a one-to-one internal resonance between the third and fourth modes, the beam possesses (a) two stable uncoupled modes and four stable coupled modes; (b) one stable <b>and</b> one <b>unstable</b> uncoupled modes <b>and</b> four stable coupled modes; (c) two <b>unstable</b> uncoupled modes <b>and</b> four stable coupled modes; and (d) two stable uncoupled modes and two stable coupled modes (each with a multiplicity of two) ...|$|R

5|$|Both stable <b>and</b> <b>unstable</b> {{isotopes}} of beryllium {{are created}} in stars, but the radioisotopes do not last long. It {{is believed that}} most of the stable beryllium in the universe was originally created in the interstellar medium when cosmic rays induced fission in heavier elements found in interstellar gas and dust. Primordial beryllium contains only one stable isotope, 9Be, and therefore beryllium is a monoisotopic element.|$|E
5|$|During summer, the Bay of Bengal {{is subject}} to intense heating, giving rise to humid <b>and</b> <b>unstable</b> air masses that morph into cyclones. The 1737 Calcutta cyclone, the 1970 Bhola cyclone, and the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone rank among the most {{powerful}} cyclones to strike India, devastating the coasts of eastern India and neighbouring Bangladesh. Widespread death and property destruction are reported {{every year in the}} exposed coastal states of West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. India's western coast, bordering the more placid Arabian Sea, experiences cyclones only rarely; these mainly strike Gujarat and, less frequently, Kerala.|$|E

5|$|However, {{there is}} another {{significant}} difference in Napoleon himself, {{in the way he}} holds himself. David's Napoleon is flamboyant, confident in his leadership of the French army, and in his ability to cross the Alps and defeat the Austrians in Italy. Delaroche's Napoleon is instead downcast, gaunt and embittered by the harsh cold. His eyes and expressionless face evidence his weariness, his tiredness a result of the long <b>and</b> <b>unstable</b> trek.|$|E
5|$|II Napoleon {{ordered the}} {{assemblage}} of over 5,000 artillery for transport through the pass, {{despite the fact}} that the pass was widely considered to be much too narrow, and the route too volatile <b>and</b> <b>unstable,</b> to allow any form of artillery, light or heavy, to come through. Thus, Napoleons military advisers warned him against this move, but he insisted on this presence of this great number of artillery.|$|E
5|$|OCD {{occurs when}} a loose piece of bone or {{cartilage}} partially (or fully) separates {{from the end of}} the bone, often because of a loss of blood supply (osteonecrosis) and decalcification of the trabecular bone matrix. The loose piece may stay in place or slide around, making the joint stiff <b>and</b> <b>unstable.</b> OCD in humans most commonly affects the knees, ankles, and elbow but can affect any joint.|$|E

5|$|Several {{clusters}} of thunderstorms {{developed during the}} morning from eastern Nebraska across Iowa into Illinois, taking place along a warm front. The front remained over the same areas during the day, as daytime heating and southwesterly surface winds brought warm <b>and</b> <b>unstable</b> air northward, resulting in severe weather development. The presence of strong winds aloft aided in development of multiple clusters and lines of thunderstorms that produced damaging wind, hail and tornadoes across Missouri, Illinois and Indiana.|$|E
5|$|Since {{trade and}} {{commerce}} typically involve items significantly more massive than one gram, and since a mass standard made of water would be inconvenient <b>and</b> <b>unstable,</b> {{the regulation of}} commerce necessitated the manufacture of a practical realization of the water-based definition of mass. Accordingly, a provisional mass standard was made as a single-piece, metallic artifact one thousand times as massive as the gram—the kilogram.|$|E
5|$|The WCHL's short <b>and</b> <b>unstable</b> {{existence}} {{was a result}} of salary escalation caused by having three leagues competing for top talent. As a result, by the mid-1920s, hockey players were among the highest paid athletes in North America, with top players able to demand even higher salaries than the top baseball stars of the time. Though the WCHL lasted only five years, the Tigers boasted five future Hockey Hall of Famers on their roster during that time.|$|E

5|$|A {{design team}} {{was formed in}} 1946 under the {{leadership}} of chief designer Ronald Bishop, who had been responsible for the Mosquito fighter-bomber. A number of unorthodox configurations were considered, ranging from canard to tailless designs; all were subsequently rejected. The Ministry of Supply was, however, interested in the most radical of the proposed designs and ordered two experimental tailless DH 108s to serve as proof of concept aircraft for testing swept-wing configurations in both low-speed and high-speed flight. During flight tests, the DH 108 gained a reputation for being accident-prone <b>and</b> <b>unstable,</b> leading de Havilland and BOAC to gravitate to conventional configurations and, necessarily, designs with less technical risk. The DH 108s were later modified to test the DH 106's power controls.|$|E
5|$|After Samus {{retrieves}} {{three pieces}} of the Light of Aether, she enters the Ing's Sky Temple and faces the Emperor Ing, the strongest Ing who guards the remaining Light of Aether. Samus defeats the creature and retrieves the last remaining energy, causing Dark Aether to become critically unstable and collapse; however, her path out of the temple is blocked by a horribly altered <b>and</b> <b>unstable</b> Dark Samus. After defeating her foe, Samus escapes as the dark world disappears around her. Returning to U-Mos, she finds that the Luminoth were {{in a state of}} hibernation but have now awakened. After a brief celebration, Samus leaves Aether in her repaired gunship. If the player completes the game with all of the items collected, Dark Samus is shown reforming herself above Aether.|$|E
5|$|Crysta is a fairy with {{a curious}} nature living in FernGully, a {{pristine}} rainforest free from human intervention. The fairies of FernGully {{once lived in}} harmony with humans, but believe them to have gone extinct after having been driven away by a dark spirit named Hexxus. Crysta is the apprentice of Magi, a motherly-figure fairy who imprisoned Hexxus in a tree. One day Crysta explores a new part of the forest and meets Batty, a bat {{who claims to have}} been experimented on by humans, giving him an obstreperous <b>and</b> <b>unstable</b> personality. However, fairies refuse to believe him, except for Crysta, who volunteers to investigate the situation. She sees Zak, a young lumberjack whom Crysta accidentally shrinks when she tries to save him from being crushed by a falling tree, though does not know how to restore him to normal size.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{diversity}} of the originally broadly defined Liliaceae (s.l.), many {{attempts have been made to}} form supageneric classification systems, organizing the genera into subfamilies, tribes, or other suprageneric taxa (taxonomic groupings between genus and family). By 1813, Candolle recognised five subdivisions which he called tribes (Asparagées, Trilliacées, Asphodelées, Bromeliées, Tulipacées), all of which Jussieu had made separate families, with the exception of Tulipa, which was a genus within the Liliaceae. By 1845, John Lindley observed that the family had become extremely diverse, ill-defined <b>and</b> <b>unstable,</b> not only by its overall circumscription, but also by its subdivisions. For the 133 genera he included, he described eleven suborders. By the 1870s, as Baker describes in his revision of the family, the taxonomy of Liliaceae had become vast and complicated. His approach was to divide the family into eight tribes.|$|E
5|$|During {{the evening}} hours of March28, 2000, a {{powerful}} F3 tornado struck downtown Fort Worth, Texas, United States and adjacent areas, causing significant damage to numerous buildings and skyscrapers {{as well as}} two deaths. The tornado {{was part of a larger}} severe weather outbreak that caused widespread storms across Texas and Oklahoma in late-March, spurred primarily by the moist <b>and</b> <b>unstable</b> atmospheric environment over the South Central United States as a result of an eastward-moving upper-level low and shortwave trough. The tornado outbreak was well-forecasted by both computer forecast models and the National Weather Service, though the eventual focal point for the severe weather—North Texas—only came into focus on March28 as the conditions favorable for tornadic development quickly took hold.|$|E
5|$|Prescott {{enrolled}} at Harvard College {{as a second}} year student (sophomore) in August 1811, {{at the age of}} 15. He was not considered academically distinguished, despite showing promise in Latin and Greek. Prescott found mathematics particularly difficult, and resorted to memorizing mathematical demonstrations word-for-word, which he could do with relative ease, in order to hide his ignorance of the subject. Prescott's eyesight degenerated after being hit in the eye with a crust of bread during a food fight as a student, and it remained weak <b>and</b> <b>unstable</b> throughout the rest of his life. Prescott was admitted to the Phi Beta Kappa Society as a senior, which he considered a great personal honor, and graduated from Harvard in 1814. After a short period of rheumatic illness, he embarked on an extended tour of Europe.|$|E
