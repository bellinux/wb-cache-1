In exotic atoms, matter and antimatter can coexist for surprisingly long times. Thus, they present a unique natural laboratory for high precision antimatter studies. In <b>artificial</b> <b>atoms,</b> electrons can be confined in an externally controlled way. This aspect is crucial, as it opens new possibilities for high precision measurements and also makes <b>artificial</b> <b>atoms</b> promising potential candidates for qubits, i. e. the essential bricks for quantum computation. The {{first part of the}} thesis presents theoretical studies of resonant states in antiprotonic atoms and spherical two-electron quantum dots, where well established techniques, frequently used for conventional atomic systems, can be applied after moderate modifications. In the framework of Markovian master equations, it is then demonstrated that systems containing resonant states can be approached as open systems in which the resonance width determines the environmental coupling. The second part of the thesis focuses on possible quantum computational aspects of two kinds of <b>artificial</b> <b>atoms,</b> quantum dots and Penning traps.

These symmetries result in selection rules that have been essential for the quantum control of atomic systems. Superconducting artificial atoms are mainly governed by parity symmetry. Its corresponding selection rule limits the types of quantum systems that can be built using electromagnetic circuits at their optimal coherence operation points ("sweet spots"). Here, we use third-order nonlinear coupling between the <b>artificial</b> <b>atom</b> and its readout resonator to drive transitions forbidden by the parity selection rule for linear coupling to microwave radiation. A Lambda-type system emerges from these newly accessible transitions, implemented here in the fluxonium <b>artificial</b> <b>atom</b> coupled to its "antenna" resonator.

This research field exploits {{on the fact that}} the coupling between a superconducting <b>artificial</b> <b>atom</b> and propagating microwave photons in a one-dimensional (1 D) open transmission line can be made strong enough to observe quantum effects, without using any cavity to confine the microwave photons. We embed an <b>artificial</b> <b>atom,</b> a superconducting transmon qubit, in a 1 D open transmission line and investigate the scattering properties of coherent microwaves. When an input coherent state, with an average photon number much less than 1, is on resonance with the <b>artificial</b> <b>atom,</b> we observe extinction of up to 99 % in the forward propagating field. We observe the strong nonlinearity of the <b>artificial</b> <b>atom</b> and under strong driving we observe the Mollow triplet.

40|$|Quantum optics is {{the study}} of {{interaction}} between atoms and photons. In the eight papers of this thesis, we study a number of systems where artificial atoms (here, superconducting circuits emulating the level structure of an atom) enable us to either improve on known concepts or experiments from quantum optics with natural atoms, or to explore entirely new regimes which have not been possible to reach in such experiments. Paper I shows how unwanted measurement back-action in a parity measurement can be avoided by fully using the information in the measurement record. Paper III is a proof-of-principle experiment demonstrating that an <b>artificial</b> <b>atom</b> built from superconducting circuits can mediate a strong photon-photon interaction. In Papers II and V, we theoretically investigate whether this interaction {{can be used in a}} setup for detecting propagating microwave photons, making the photon to be detected impart a phase shift on a coherent probe signal. We find that one atom is not enough to overcome the quantum background noise, but it turns out that several atoms cascaded in the right way can do the trick. In Paper IV, we explain experimental results for a driven <b>artificial</b> <b>atom</b> coupled to photons in a resonator.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{collective}} effects that emerge in waveguide quantum electrodynamics where several (<b>artificial)</b> <b>atoms</b> are coupled to a one-dimensional superconducting transmission line. Since single microwave photons can travel without loss {{for a long}} distance along the line, real and virtual photons emitted by one atom can be reabsorbed or scattered by a second atom. Depending on {{the distance between the}} atoms, this collective effect can lead to super- and subradiance or to a coherent exchange-type interaction between the <b>atoms.</b> Changing the <b>artificial</b> <b>atoms</b> transition frequencies, something which can be easily done with superconducting qubits (two levels <b>artificial</b> <b>atoms),</b> is equivalent to changing the atom-atom separation and thereby opens the possibility to study the characteristics of these collective effects. To study this waveguide quantum electrodynamics system, we extend previous work and present an effective master equation valid for an ensemble of inhomogeneous atoms driven by a coherent state. Using input-output theory, we compute analytically and numerically the elastic and inelastic scattering and show how these quantities reveal information about collective effects.
