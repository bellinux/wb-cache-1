5|$|A {{significant}} crossbreeding influence used {{to revitalize}} the Appaloosa was the Arabian horse, as evidenced by early registration lists that show Arabian-Appaloosa crossbreeds <b>as</b> <b>ten</b> of the first fifteen horses registered with the ApHC. For example, one of Claude Thompson's major herd sires was Ferras, an Arabian stallion bred by W.K. Kellogg from horses imported from the Crabbet Arabian Stud of England. Ferras sired Red Eagle, a prominent Appaloosa stallion added to the Appaloosa Hall of Fame in 1988. Later, Thoroughbred and Quarter Horse lines were added, as well as crosses from other breeds, including Morgans and Standardbreds. In 1983 the ApHC {{reduced the number of}} allowable outcrosses to three main breeds: the Arabian horse, the American Quarter Horse and the Thoroughbred.|$|E

5|$|After U-3s {{arrival at}} Pola in January 1909, she was {{commissioned}} into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 12 September 1909 as SM U-3. During {{the evaluation of}} the U-3 class conducted by the Navy, the class' poor diving and handling characteristics were noted. To alleviate the diving problems, U-3s fins were changed in size and shape several times, and eventually, the front diving planes were removed and a stationary stern flap was affixed to the hull. U-3 served as a training boat between 1910 and 1914 and made as many <b>as</b> <b>ten</b> cruises per month in that capacity.|$|E

5|$|Any German {{invasion}} of Britain {{would have to}} involve the landing of troops and equipment somewhere on the coast, and the most vulnerable areas were {{the south and east}} coasts of England. Here, Emergency Coastal Batteries were constructed to protect ports and likely landing places. They were fitted with whatever guns were available, which mainly came from naval vessels scrapped {{since the end of the}} First World War. These included 6inch (152mm), 5.5inch (140mm), 4.7inch (120mm) and 4inch (102mm) guns. These had little ammunition, sometimes as few <b>as</b> <b>ten</b> rounds apiece. At Dover, two 14inch (356mm) guns known as Winnie and Pooh were employed. There were also a few land based torpedo launching sites.|$|E

As the seasons changed the process was renewed.|$|E
5|$|At its fullest extent (but {{excluding}} the scattered disc), including its outlying regions, the Kuiper belt stretches from roughly 30 to 55 AU. The {{main body of}} the belt is generally accepted to extend from the 2:3 mean-motion resonance (see below) at 39.5 AU to the 1:2 resonance at roughly 48 AU. The Kuiper belt is quite thick, with the main concentration extending as much <b>as</b> <b>ten</b> degrees outside the ecliptic plane and a more diffuse distribution of objects extending several times farther. Overall it more resembles a torus or doughnut than a belt. Its mean position is inclined to the ecliptic by 1.86 degrees.|$|E
50|$|A {{femtosecond}} {{is equal}} to 1000 attoseconds, or 1/1000 picosecond. Because the next higher SI unit is 1000 times larger, times of 10−14 and 10−13 seconds are typically expressed <b>as</b> <b>tens</b> or hundreds of femtoseconds.|$|R

5|$|Final reports {{indicate}} that the official death toll, according to the Louisiana Department of Health, was 1,464 people. The first deaths were reported shortly before midnight on August 28, 2005, as three nursing home patients died during an evacuation to Baton Rouge. On September 4, Mayor Nagin speculated that the death toll could rise as high <b>as</b> <b>ten</b> thousand after the clean-up was completed. Some survivors and evacuees reported seeing bodies lying in city streets and floating in still-flooded sections, especially in {{the east of the}} city. The advanced state of decomposition of many corpses, some of which were left in the water or sun for days before being collected, hindered efforts by coroners to identify many of the dead.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with the plan for decimalisation of the currency (120 years after this denomination was first introduced in the initial plan to introduce a decimal currency), from 1968 the ten pence coin was introduced of the same size, weight and metal composition as the florin. Thus, the florin ceased to be struck for circulation after the 1967-dated pieces. The new and the old circulated side by side as florins prior to Decimal Day (15 February 1971) and <b>as</b> <b>ten</b> pence pieces after.|$|E

5|$|Molecular {{studies have}} {{supported}} monophyly {{in the family}} Bovidae (a group of organisms comprises an ancestral species and all their descendants). The number of subfamilies in Bovidae is disputed, with suggestions of as many <b>as</b> <b>ten</b> and as few as two subfamilies. However, molecular, morphological and fossil evidence indicates the existence of eight distinct subfamilies : Aepycerotinae (consisting of just the impala), Alcelaphinae (bontebok, hartebeest, wildebeest and relatives), Antilopinae (several antelopes, gazelles, and relatives), Bovinae (cattle, buffaloes, bison and other antelopes), Caprinae (goats, sheep, ibex, serows and relatives), Cephalophinae (duikers), Hippotraginae (addax, oryx and relatives) and Reduncinae (reedbuck and kob antelopes). In addition, three extinct subfamilies are known: Hypsodontinae (mid-Miocene), Oiocerinae (Turolian) and the subfamily Tethytraginae, which contains Tethytragus (mid-Miocene).|$|E
