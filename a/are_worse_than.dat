5|$|Although {{the series}} fictionalises {{the world of}} MI5, several storylines are based on truth. The series had advisors who were ex-MI5 officers. The writers also {{research}} heavily on each episode. The producers were keen in world events that Britain and America were directly or indirectly responsible for, where the consequences of an operation <b>are</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> what they intended to resolve in the first place, known as blowback. One example includes the two powers aiding the Afghan Mujahideen in 1989 before {{pulling out of the}} country; this ultimately lead to the rise of Al-Qaeda.|$|E

In general risk scoring systems {{look for any}} of the following negative events; charge offs, collections, late payments, repossessions, foreclosures, settlements, bankruptcies, liens, and judgements. Within this category FICO considers the severity of the negative item, the age of the negative items and the prevalence of negative items. Newer <b>is</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> older.

Since 2 / 4 [*]<[*] 2 / 3 [*]<[*] 3 / 4, the recovery related to 2 / 4 should <b>be</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> the recovery related to 2 / 3; whereas the recovery related to 2 / 3 should <b>be</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> the recovery related to 3 / 4.

25|$|Age for {{decrease}} of L2 grammaticality performance varies from early childhood to late adolescence, {{depending on the}} combinations of the speaker’s first and second language. The age of acquisition at which L2 learners <b>are</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> native speakers depends on how dissimilar the L1 and L2 are on phonological and grammatical level. For example, Chinese/English bilinguals at 7 years old perform {{just as well as}} Spanish/English bilinguals at 16 years old. This {{is due to the fact}} that a grammatical construction on an L2 that has a parallel structure in an L1 would impose less processing demand than one that does not have a parallel, causing a poorer performance on language structure.|$|E
25|$|Most {{people who}} present {{to mental health}} specialists develop {{agoraphobia}} after the onset of panic disorder. Agoraphobia is best understood as an adverse behavioral outcome of repeated panic attacks and subsequent anxiety and preoccupation with these attacks that leads to an avoidance of situations where a panic attack could occur. Early treatment of panic disorder can often prevent agoraphobia. Agoraphobia is typically determined when symptoms <b>are</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> panic disorder, but also {{do not meet the}} criteria for other anxiety disorders such as depression. In rare cases where agoraphobics do not meet the criteria used to diagnose panic disorder, the formal diagnosis of agoraphobia without history of panic disorder is used (primary agoraphobia).|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, yet not as favorable {{for many of}} the band's previous records. Stephen Thomas Erlewine, senior editor for AllMusic, noted that the Ramones desired mainstream success much more and were recording music in such a fashion as to expand their fan-base. Another AllMusic editor, T. Donald Guarisco, noted that the [...] "entire album is pretty controversial in the world of Ramones fandom." [...] Music critic Robert Christgau called the album [...] "sad", noting that his favorite songs were [...] "I'm Affected", [...] "Baby, I Love You", and [...] "Danny Says". He also pointed out that Spector's production failed to make much of a difference in the band's overall sound, saying [...] "his guitar overdubs <b>are</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> his orchestrations, and they're not uncute." ...|$|E

Ann makes out with Chris and, {{although she was}} too drunk to even remember the incident the next day, he develops romantic feelings for her. Ann rebuffs his requests for dates, and finds him too intense, but the ever-optimistic Chris does not become discouraged and insists he will continue courting her. Meanwhile, in [...] "Freddy Spaghetti", Chris and Ben reveal Pawnee's budget problems <b>are</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> anticipated, which would require the government to be temporarily shut down, much to the horror of Leslie, but the delight of parks and recreation director Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman), an anti-government libertarian. Chris and Ben even consider firing Leslie to save money, but Ron persuades them otherwise.|$|E
500|$|While he {{remained}} genial in public, Rimsky-Korsakov personally found {{the situation with}} Tchaikovsky more conflicting. He was uncomfortable that Tchaikovsky was becoming more popular among Rimsky-Korsakov's followers, and had developed a jealous resentment of Tchaikovsky's greater fame. He confessed his fears to his friend, the Moscow critic Semyon Kruglikov, writing that if Tchaikovsky followed through with a contemplated move to Saint Petersburg, a group of followers [...] "will immediately form around him, which Lyadov and Glazunov will certainly join, and after them many others... ur youth will drown (and not only our youth—look at Lyadov) {{in a sea of}} eclecticism that will rob them of their individuality." [...] About this eclecticism, and Tchaikovsky's part in it, Rimsky-Korsakov wrote in his memoirs, seemingly matter-of-factly, [...] "By this time quite an accretion of new elements and young blood had accumulated in Belyayev's circle. New times, new birds, new songs." [...] Yet to Kruglikov he confessed in 1890, [...] "New times, new birds, new birds , new songs—except our birds are not so new, and the new songs they sing <b>are</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> the old ones." ...|$|E
500|$|The second chapter, [...] "The Great Experiment", {{continues}} {{the examination of}} Stone Age progress {{by looking at the}} advancements in hunting. Wright uses the term [...] "progress trap" [...] to refer to innovations that create new problems for which the society is unable or unwilling to solve, or inadvertently create conditions that <b>are</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> what existed before the innovation. For example, innovations in hunting during the Stone Age allowed for more successful hunts and consequently more free time during which culture and art were created (e.g. cave paintings, bone carvings, etc.), but also led to extinctions, most notably of megafauna. As smaller and smaller game were hunted to replace larger extinct animals, the hunts became less successful and culture declined. Agriculture, and subsequently civilisations, independently arising in multiple regions at about the same time, ~10,000 years ago, indicates to Wright that [...] "given certain broad conditions, human societies everywhere will move towards greater size, complexity and environmental demand". The chapter title refers to the human experience which Wright sees as a large experiment testing what conditions are required for a human civilisation to succeed.|$|E

500|$|Retrospective reviews {{have been}} more negative. In 2014, David Sims of The Wire listed Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut in his list of [...] "directors' cuts messed up their own movies". Sims disliked the lack of {{ambiguity}} in Kelly's new version, and argued that [...] "crowbarring [...] into his director's cut made for a lesser movie". Similarly, Tom Hawking of Flavorwire felt that the director's cut ruined the [...] "enduring ambiguity" [...] of the original. Hawking included Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut in his 2010 list of [...] "10 director's cuts that <b>are</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> the original". Writing in Collider.com {{for a review of}} the 10-year anniversary Blu-ray, Scott Wampler said that he felt [...] "let-down" [...] by the director's cut, and that it was [...] "right in line with the sort of choices [...] made as a filmmaker since releasing Donnie Darko". In the Total Film book The 100 Greatest Movies of All Time, where the original cut of Donnie Darko was listed at number 87, Jonathan Dean also criticized this loss of ambiguity, remarking: [...] "Unwisely building concrete bypasses over gossamer plot strands, [...] steers us through a spaghetti junction of possible meanings when all we really want to do is get lost." [...] In a 2016 retrospective review, Germain Lussler of io9 stated that the director's cut [...] "simply isn't as good" [...] and [...] "feels less magical". He argued that the inclusion of The Philosophy of Time Travel [...] " [...] the film from being a text that the viewer could read into whatever they wanted".|$|E
