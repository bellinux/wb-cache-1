5|$|While Wally goes to <b>a</b> <b>funeral</b> <b>home</b> {{to attend}} {{the wake of a}} former estate client, the client's son claims that his father was killed by Krayoxx, a {{cholesterol-lowering}} drug developed by the (fictional) pharmaceutical company Varrick Labs. Ecstatic at the possible monetary returns on the case, the firm finds several former clients who appear to have valid claims about Krayoxx. Oscar and Wally generate publicity in the Chicago Tribune with a picture of their filing; this induces an avalanche of communications and leads them to several additional claimants. However, Wally and his fellows are far out of their depth. None of the three Finley & Figg lawyers has ever argued in a United States federal court, and they have only a vague idea of what is involved in confronting a major corporation which is able to hire the best legal talent around - which turns out to be Zinc's old firm.|$|E

25|$|When {{a person}} dies in the Philippines, Filipino Catholic people, {{such as the}} Tagalogs, {{generally}} hold a wake known as lamay or paglalamay, a vigil that typically lasts for three to seven nights, but may last longer if the bereaved family is waiting for a relation traveling from afar. During this time, the cleaned and embalmed corpse is placed in a coffin, and displayed {{at the house of}} deceased or <b>a</b> <b>funeral</b> <b>home.</b> The casket is traditionally surrounded by funeral lights, a guest registry book, a contribution box, and flowers. Family members, relatives, and acquaintances participate in the vigil.|$|E
25|$|In {{relation}} to burial practices, the Philippine culture has borrowed heavily from the Americans. In the Philippine wake for example, {{it is in}} tradition that the family and friends hold {{the body of the}} deceased in a casket for 5 to 7 days for viewing; this is patterned from the Visitation practiced also in American wakes, in which they host the deceased's body clothed and treated with various cosmetics in <b>a</b> <b>funeral</b> <b>home</b> for display and presentability. Both cultures adapting to a similar execution of ritual grief. Another turning point courtesy of the American influence is the practice of cremation. Drawing heavily from the Catholic faith, many Filipinos do not practice cremation as they believe that the body must remain intact in order to fulfil and prepare for the resurrection of the dead. Filipinos claimed that cremation must not be observed due to the Catholic church banning this practice, however as early as 1963 the ban was lifted and this point was emphasized in the 1983 revised Canon Law.|$|E
25|$|The {{secret in}} {{question}} suggested that Bearer had a traumatic past with The Undertaker, long preceding Brother Love's joining the two as manager and protege in January 1991. The secret was as follows: The Undertaker's mother {{had an affair}} with Bearer and as a result, gave birth to a younger half-brother of The Undertaker, named Kane. (It's important to note that while growing up, Undertaker {and presumably his deceased father} lived the vast majority of his life {entirety of the father's life} under the belief that Kane was fully related to him and his family; that is, until Bearer unintentionally {kayfabe} revealed to a Raw audience that he was actually Kane's father, this {{as a result of an}} affair Bearer had with their mother and thus making Kane and Undertaker half-brothers). However in real life they are not brothers. This came to light when Bearer informed Jerry Lawler on Monday Night Raw, at a point in which he thought cameras had stopped rolling for a commercial but were still on. Growing up, Undertaker lived in <b>a</b> <b>funeral</b> <b>home</b> with his family. According to the secret, The Undertaker committed arson/murder, burning down the family funeral home, in the process, killing his parents and scarring his half-brother's face. Bearer, who survived the fire, hid Kane in a mental asylum during the rest of Kane's youth into adulthood. In the meantime, Bearer went on to form an alliance with The Undertaker while in the World Wrestling Federation, standing by his side for six years before eventually turning on him at SummerSlam.|$|E
