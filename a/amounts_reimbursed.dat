The article describes briefly the evolution of regional development policy, the financial allocations, the impact of EU funds within cohesion policy, legal and institutional framework in Romania, and the institutions which {{are responsible for the}} management of EU funds. In Romania, the absorption of structural and cohesion funds is still a problem due to high rejection rate and the existing problems in procuring their own funds by the beneficiaries, such as beneficiary’s contribution, starting the project and covering the non-eligible expenditures. Romanian authorities should increase the absorption rate on transport sector and other sectors where absorption is a problem. Access to Social and Cohesion Funds represents for Romania an opportunity to develop balanced regions, to modernize transportation and environmental infrastructure to support rural development, employment opportunities for labor market, and to promote social policies to increase living standards. Romania has to consider “Life Long Learning” as a priority {{in the development of the}} human resources. Less bureaucracy is necessary for a normal development of procedures for refund claims. Also, it is necessary to shorten the time for reimbursement and to simplify related procedures. By increasing the <b>amounts</b> <b>reimbursed,</b> the authorities would increase the possibility to use EU funds more quickly.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{estimate}} the direct costs of hospital stays for premature newborns in the Interlagos Hospital and Maternity Center in São Paulo, Brazil {{and to assess}} {{the difference between the}} amount reimbursed to the hospital by the Unified Health System and the real cost of care for each premature newborn. METHODS: A cost-estimate study in which hospital and professional costs were estimated for premature infants born at 22 to 36 weeks gestation during the calendar year of 2004 and surviving beyond one hour of age. Direct costs included hospital services, professional care, diagnoses and therapy, orthotics, prosthetics, special materials, and blood products. Costs were estimated using tables published by the Unified Health System and the Brasindice as well as the list of medical procedures provided by the Brazilian Classification of Medical Procedures. RESULTS: The average direct cost of care for initial hospitalization of a premature newborn in 2004 was $ 2, 386 USD. Total hospital expenses and professional services for all premature infants in this hospital were $ 227, 000 and $ 69, 500 USD, respectively. The costs for diagnostic testing and blood products for all premature infants totaled $ 22, 440 and $ 1, 833 USD. The daily average cost of a premature newborn weighing less than 1, 000 g was $ 115 USD, and the daily average cost of a premature newborn weighing more than 2, 500 g was $ 89 USD. <b>Amounts</b> <b>reimbursed</b> to the hospital by the Unified Health System corresponded to only 27. 42 % of the real cost of care. CONCLUSIONS: The cost of hospital stays for premature newborns was much greater than the amount reimbursed to the hospital by the Unified Health System. The highest costs corresponded to newborns with lower birth weight. Hospital costs progressively and discretely decreased as the newborns' weight increased.

40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} {{the frequency of}} the thirty long-term disorders (ALD 30) and to calculate the costs to the health fund according to the recorded diagnosis as a function of type of healthcare provided. Methods: We performed a descriptive survey of beneficiaries of the general scheme of the health fund in the Midi-Pyrénées region (1. 7 million individuals in 2003). The frequency and cost of each of the ALD 30 was determined by consulting the health fund’s reimbursement database and the medical service’s database on benefits attributed to affiliates. Results: 210, 130 patients had been attributed an ALD 30 in the Midi-Pyrénées region on December 31, 2003 (12. 4 % of the covered population). Their average age was 62 years. 52 % of the patients were females. The most frequent affections recorded were malignant tumors (2. 3 % of the affiliates in the general scheme), long-term psychiatric disorders (2. 3 %) and diabetes mellitus (2. 2 %). The average annual reimbursement per patient was 7, 512 €, of which 4, 942 € were directly related to their ALD 30. The average annual reimbursement per patient varied from 3, 000 to 30, 000 € according to each different disease. 5 % of the patients who had been reimbursed for the greatest expenses represented 37 % of total expenditures. The average <b>amount</b> <b>reimbursed</b> to patients in their final year of life was 22, 033 €. Conclusion: This type of analysis enables us to follow the financial resources that the health fund spends on patients who have been attributed an ALD 30, both over time and geographically.

40|$|Aim: Our aim was {{to update}} {{available}} data concerning the prevalence and cost of diabetes in metropolitan France by measuring the contemporary changes recorded from national health fund’s public health program, launched in 1999. Methods: We performed a retrospective study using patient reimbursement data from all the 128 local health offices (CPAM) in metropolitan France. We selected patients who received reimbursements for an oral hypoglycemic agent or insulin. Thus, 704, 423 patients were studied by using 1998 data and 1, 145, 603 patients were studied by using data from 2000. The expenditures studied represented the total <b>amount</b> <b>reimbursed</b> by national health insurance to diabetic patients, irrespective {{of the type of}} diabetes they had. The cost differential which could be attributed to diabetes was calculated by determining the difference between costs generated by diabetic patients to those generated {{by the rest of the}} population of the same age. Results: Between 1998 and 2000, the prevalence of diabetes treated with oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin in the population of affiliates covered by the general scheme stricto sensu increased from 2. 78 % to 2. 96 %, corresponding to an average annual increase of 3. 2 %. The total amount paid by the general scheme for care to diabetic patients (related to diabetes or not) was 5. 710 billion euros in 2000 compared to 4. 862 billion euros in 1998. The amount which can be attributed to diabetes alone can be estimated to be 2. 414 billion euros in 2000 compared to 2. 021 euros in 1998. After considering the impact of the increase in the number of treated diabetics, a modification in the modalities of medical care probably accounts for 183 million euros of the cost increase. Medical equipment (self blood glucose monitoring devices, reagent strips, finger lancets…) accounts for 39. 3 % (72 million euros) of this cost differential, medications account for 34. 4 % (63 million euros), nursing care 16. 9 % (31 million euros), patient transportation 6. 6 % (12 million euros), and laboratory tests 2. 7 % (5 million euros). There was no change in the cost of diabetes with relation to expenses for medical consultations. Conclusion: The analysis of Social Security’s reimbursement data, by using the specific computer code numbers for medicines and laboratory tests, allows us to monitor changes in the prevalence of treated diabetics and follow the cost of care delivered to these patients...|$|R

The dependent variable used was the <b>amount</b> of <b>reimbursed</b> money. Two types of model were constructed, namely, the system dynamic model using the STELLA software and the multiple linear regression model. The outputs of both methods were compared. ResultsThe study covered 284, 716 patients from various levels of providers. The system dynamic model had the capability of producing various types of outputs, for example, financial and graphical analyses. For the regression analysis, statistically significant predictors were composed of service types (outpatient or inpatient), operating procedures, length of stay, illness types (accident or not), hospital characteristics, age, and hospital location (adjusted R 2 = 0. 74). The total budget arrived at from using the system dynamic model and regression model was US$ 12, 159, 614. 38 and US$ 7, 301, 217. 18, respectively, whereas the actual NHSO reimbursement cost was US$ 12, 840, 805. 69.

Little has been published regarding the method of payment for patient participation. As clinical trials move into widely dispersed community practices and more complex designs, the method of payment also becomes more complex. Here we review the decision process and payment method selected for a primary care-based randomized clinical trial of asthma management in Black Americans. Methods: The method selected is a credit card system designed specifically for clinical trials that allows both fixed and variable real-time payments. We operationalized the study design by providing each patient with two cards, one for reimbursement for study visits and one for payment of medication costs directly to the pharmacies. Results: Of the 1015 patients enrolled, only two refused use of the ClinCard, requesting cash payments for visits and only rarely a weekend or fill-in pharmacist refused to use the card system for payment directly to the pharmacy. Overall, the system has been well accepted by patients and local study teams. The ClinCard administrative system facilitates the fiscal accounting and medication adherence record-keeping by the central teams. Monthly fees are modest, and all 12 study institutional review boards approved use of the system without concern for patient confidentiality after reviewing all regulatory documents provided by ClinCard.

Differences in diastolic blood pressure reductions among the comparative agents were used to estimate reductions in the annualised risk of cardiovascular (CV) and cerebrovascular events using the Framingham model. These annualised risks were translated into reductions in healthcare expenditures associated with treating CV events covered by managed care in the US. Data sources included: the recently published clinical trial of ARB antihypertensive efficacy, the Framingham Heart Study and a managed care database. Actual <b>reimbursed</b> <b>amounts</b> were used. Results: Based on antihypertensive efficacy data versus irbesartan, the use of olmesartan medoxomil is expected to reduce the number of new cases of CV disease, resulting in a first-year reduction in cost in a cohort of 100 000 patients of $US 906 000. Similarly, a reduction in new cases of coronary heart disease (CHD) resulted in a cost reduction of $US 701 000; a cost reduction of $US 196 000 for fewer myocardial infarctions (MI); and a cost reduction of $US 28 000 for fewer strokes. Over 5 years, these estimates increase to $US 5 410 000 for fewer cases of CV disease; $US 3 975 000 for fewer cases of CHD; $US 1 430 000 for fewer MI; and $US 497 000 for fewer strokes. Compared with valsartan, the use of olmesartan medoxomil is estimated to reduce by $US 3 397 000 the expected cost of treating a cohort of 100 000 patients in the first year for fewer cases of CV disease; by $US 2 426 000 for fewer cases of CHD; by $US 565 000 for fewer MI; and by $US 124 000 for fewer strokes. Over 5 years, these estimates increase to $US 16 231 000 for CV disease; $US 11 955 000 for CHD; $US 4 505 000 for MI; and $ 1 741 000 for stroke. Compared with losartan, the estimated reduction in first-year cost is $US 2 969 000 for CV disease for the cohort of 100 000 patients; $US 2 163 000 for CHD; $US 732 000 for MI; and $US 124 000 for stroke. Over 5 years, these estimates increase to $US 15 149 000 for CV disease; $US 11 107 000 for CHD; $US 4 057 000 for MI; and $ 1 437 000 for stroke. Conclusion: Based on comparative antihypertensive efficacy data, treatment of hypertensive patients with olmesartan medoxomil instead of the other leading ARBs has the potential to reduce overall cost of medical care in a US managed care setting.

40|$|In {{response}} to real and perceived short-comings {{in the quality}} and productivity of software engineering practices and projects, professionally-endorsed graduate and post-graduate curriculum guides {{have been developed to}} meet evolving technical developments and industry demands. Each of these curriculum guidelines identifies better software engineering management skills and soft, peopleware skills as critical for all graduating students, but they provide little guidance on how to achieve this. One possible way is to use a serious game — a game designed to educate players about some of the dynamic complexities of the field in a safe and inexpensive environment. This thesis presents the results of a qualitative research project that used a simple game of a software project to see if and how games could contribute to better software project management education; and if they could, then what features and attributes made them most efficacious. That is, shall we— should we— play games in software engineering management? The primary research tool for this project was a game called Simsoft. Physically, Simsoft comes in two pieces. There is an A 0 -sized printed game board around which the players gather to discuss the current state of their project and to consider their next move. The board shows the flow of the game while plastic counters are used to represent the staff of the project. Poker chips represent the team’s budget, with which they can purchase more staff, and from which certain game events may draw or <b>reimburse</b> <b>amounts</b> depending on decisions made {{during the course of the}} game. There is also a simple Java-based dashboard, through which the players can see the current and historical state of the project in a series of reports and messages; and they can adjust the project’s settings. The engine behind Simsoft is a system dynamics model which embodies the fundamental causal relationships of simple software development projects. In Simsoft game sessions, teams of students, and practicing project managers and software engineers managed a hypothetical software development project with the aim of completing the project on time and within budget (with poker chips left over). Based on the starting scenario of the game, information provided during the game, and their own real-world experience, the players made decisions about how to proceed— whether to hire more staff or reduce the number, what hours should be worked, and so on. After each decision set had been entered, the game was run for another next time period, (a week, a month, or a quarter). The game was now in a new state which the players had to interpret from the game board and decide how to proceed. The findings showed that games can contribute to better software engineering management education and help bridge the pedagogical gaps in current curriculum guidelines. However, they can’t do this by themselves and for best effect they should be used in conjunction with other pedagogical tools. The findings also showed that simple games and games in which the players are able to relate the game world to an external context are the most efficacious...|$|R
