500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and at a later press conference. Häkkinen was delighted with his victory: [...] "This was an incredible win. It {{was a very difficult}} and unusual situation including my spin which of course was not planned. The kerbs here are very slippery and once you go over one there is not much you can do. I was lucky to keep going <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to chase Michael. But the car got better and better." [...] The driver added that he wanted to review his overtaking manoeuvre to see if Michael Schumacher performed an illegal move. Schumacher said that despite improvements to his car, he was unable to match Häkkinen's overall pace. He added that he experienced no problems running off-line to cool his tyres, and was happy to run behind backmarkers for straight-line speed assistance during the race's closing stages.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} {{finishers}} {{appeared on the}} podium to collect their trophies, and in the subsequent press conference. Button felt the win {{was the best of}} his career so far, and stated that he had to fight hard to win the race: [...] "It was really a fight. I got a drive-through for speeding behind the safety car and I had to fight my way through about three times. Eventually, on the last lap I was chasing down Seb. He ran a little bit wide onto the wet part of the circuit <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to take the opportunity and take the win." [...] Button also praised his team and strategy for helping him take the victory, in particular the moves to intermediate tyres. Vettel expressed his disappointment of making a mistake on the final lap, after driving a faultless race up to that point. Nevertheless, he was happy with second place, as he had increased his championship lead. Webber said he was happy to finish third after his incident {{at the beginning of the}} race, putting his recovery from fourteenth place down to correct tyre choices.|$|E

500|$|The {{top three}} {{finishers}} {{appeared in the}} subsequent press conference where Alonso said {{that the decision to}} run a shorter second stint than Kubica (between the first and second pit stops) was his decision: [...] "Sometimes you can do it, sometimes you can't but today the car was perfect <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to do it." [...] Alonso added that he had confidence in the car to perform at the remaining Grands Prix: [...] "The feeling I have now is that we can do anything". Kubica said that his second-placed finish was better than his win at the Canadian Grand Prix earlier in the season. He added that to finish on the podium after BMW Sauber's failure to improve the car {{from the beginning of the}} season was a [...] "great result for the team in, I think, a very difficult moment". Räikkönen said that he was [...] "a bit disappointed because being in first place in the first corner but then being pushed out didn't help and being in the front could have given us a better result but anyhow, that's racing". He added that Kovalainen's impact with him at the first corner had caused handling difficulties in his car, which left him unable to improve on his third-placed finish.|$|E

Domont took the maximum points atop the first KOM of the day. As they crossed the line for the last time with [...] to go, the breakers were resisting as the time difference was still around a minute. On the second lap of the finishing circuit, Domont was dropped from the breakaway and adsorbed in to the peloton. The now three-rider break had a thirty-second advantage with [...] remaining. Team Katusha controlled the front of the field in the final kilometers. With [...] to go, the peloton almost pulled back the all unyielding breakers, Kwiatkowski decided to go alone. He was caught in sight of the finish line. The uphill sprint was won by Alexander Kristoff of , with Peter Sagan (Tinkoff-Saxo) being a close second. Sagan got out of Kristoff's slipstream to try to out-sprint him in the final meters, but to no avail. This was Kristoff's eighteenth victory of the season. Through bad positioning, Pinot lost a further five seconds to Geraint Thomas (Team Sky) in the overall classification. [...] "It was a hard day, I haven't felt super in this Tour de Suisse but I did a good sprint today," [...] said the winner. [...] "I got ahead of Sagan <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to go again at the end to hold off his run." ...|$|E

We were flat broke, and that's happened to me three times, where my wife and I have had to sell off everything and go and stay with her parents or do whatever. I installed carpeting for a while in Los Angeles and stuff like that. You do what you've got to do to survive." [...] In London, Evans briefly had jobs insulating pipes, and driving a taxi. Collins was having trouble paying the lease on the group's two-room rehearsal studio at No. 6 Denmark Street, London.

[...] Despite his twelve-second penalty for the overuse of FanBoost, Pahkala was sanguine, feeling that the worlds of simulation and real life racing belong together and reserved praise for the development of motor racing eSport events: [...] "In the end, P3 was more than welcome for me. It’s been a blast! I made some mistakes in the practice session preparation which cost me pace later on and P3 is more than fair for everyone with what happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|With the {{break-up}} of I dritti due to financial failure, Fo and {{family moved to}} Rome {{in the hope of}} gaining work as a screenwriter in the cinema. There they lived next door to Roberto Rossellini and Ingrid Bergman. Fo worked for many productions, including those of Dino De Laurentiis. Rame worked in Teatro Stabile of Bolzano. In 1956, Fo co-wrote and acted with Rame in the Carlo Lizzani's film Lo svitato (The screwball), influenced by Jacques Tati, Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. In the film, Fo plays [...] "a disoriented hotel porter cast adrift in a neo-capitalist Milan of skyscrapers and modern technology". Other films followed. In 1958, the couple returned to Milan when Rame was offered roles in a series of farces at the Arlecchino Theatre. Fo and Rame were subsequently based there. Fo said, [...] "For me the lesson of the cinema meant learning from a technical point of view what audiences had already grasped: a story divided into sequences, a fast pace, sharp dialogue, and getting rid of the conventions of space and time. Working on screenplays gave me an apprenticeship as a playwright <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to transfer the lessons of the new technical means to the theatre".|$|E
2500|$|Zhirinovsky has {{expressed}} {{admiration for the}} 1996 United States presidential election contender Pat Buchanan, referring positively to a comment in which Buchanan labeled the United States Congress [...] "Israeli-occupied territory." [...] Zhirinovsky said that both countries were [...] "under occupation." [...] and that [...] "to survive, we could set aside places on U.S. and Russian territories to deport this small but troublesome tribe." [...] Buchanan strongly rejected this endorsement, saying he would provide safe haven to persecuted minorities if Zhirinovsky were ever elected Russia's president, eliciting a harsh response by Zhirinovsky: [...] "You soiled your pants {{as soon as you}} got my congratulations. Who are you afraid of: Zionists?" [...] Zhirinovsky repeatedly denied his father's Jewishness until he published Ivan Close Your Soul in July 2001, describing how his father, Volf Isaakovich Eidelshtein, changed his surname from Eidelshtein to Zhirinovsky. He rhetorically asked, [...] "Why should I reject Russian blood, Russian culture, Russian land, and {{fall in love with the}} Jewish people only because of that single drop of blood that my father left in my mother's body?" [...] Another frequently cited quote from Zhirinovsky is [...] "My mother was Russian and my father was a lawyer". Zhirinovsky later disowned the statement, after researching his father's life in Israel (where, after leaving Zhrinovsky's mother, he had immigrated in 1949 with a new wife, and worked as an agronomist in Tel Aviv). Discussing the statement, Zhirinovsky says: [...] "Journalists mocked me: for saying I was the son of a lawyer. And I am really the son of an agronomist." [...] Discussing his father, Zhirinovsky says with tears in his eyes: [...] "All my life I was looking for him. I believed that he was alive. I believed that someday he would find me... But there is a silver lining. I tried to imitate him... <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to achieve a certain position in life, even without the support of my father." ...|$|E
