[...] The title is a reference to her belief that [...] "we as individuals... are still so innocent that we think if we <b>asked</b> <b>our</b> murderer just before he puts the final wrench upon the throat, 'Would you please give me a cool drink of water?' and he would do so'".

2500|$|Appearing as a {{prosecution}} witness {{at the trial}} {{of members of the}} unit in 2009, Jefto Jankovic, former investigative judge with the Basic Court in Banja Luka, told how on 23 August 1992, after receiving a call from the Public Safety Station in Banja Luka, he went to Korićanske Stijene to conduct a crime-scene inspection: [...] "We arrived there at about 3pm We saw that the area was rocky, the canyon was about 100 to 300 meters deep. I saw two piles of corpses {{at the bottom of the}} canyon. The corpses were lying there one on top of the other. It was a frightening scene. It was something I had never seen in my life. As it was impossible to approach them, I <b>asked</b> <b>our</b> crime technician to record it using a video camcorder. This is all that we did during the course of the crime-scene inspection." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{spokesperson}} for the National Abortion Federation, an association of abortion providers, noted that Gosnell had been rejected for membership following inspection, because his clinics did not meet appropriate standards of care, but that [...] "they’d cleaned the place up and hired an RN [...] for our visit. We only saw first-trimester procedures." [...] She adding that [...] "Unfortunately, some women don't know where to turn. You sometimes have substandard providers preying on low-income women who don't know {{that they do have}} other (safe) options." [...] A {{spokesperson for}} Planned Parenthood in Southeastern Pennsylvania, condemned Gosnell, saying, [...] "We would condemn any physician who does not follow the law or endangers anyone’s health... All women should have access to high-quality care when they are vulnerable and facing difficult decisions." [...] Dayle Steinberg, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania, says she knew that Gosnell had provided abortions in Philadelphia for many years, but says she hadn't heard of any problems at his clinic until the allegations surfaced. She has been quoted as stating that [...] "when Gosnell was in practice, women would sometimes come to Planned Parenthood for services after first visiting Gosnell's West Philadelphia clinic, and would complain to staff about the conditions there. We would always encourage them to report it to the Department of Health." [...] She clarified that [...] "when Gosnell was arrested, I <b>asked</b> <b>our</b> staff if anyone had ever heard of him, and clinic staff members reported that a few women over the years said they were concerned about the uncleanliness of his facility and came to Planned Parenthood instead... if we had heard anything remotely like the conditions that have since come to light about Gosnell's facility, of course we would have alerted the state and other authorities".|$|E

2500|$|In a 14 February 2007 {{news conference}} U.S. President George W. Bush reiterated {{his claim that}} the Quds Force was causing unrest in Iraq, stating: [...] "I can say with {{certainty}} that the Quds force, {{a part of the}} Iranian government, has provided these sophisticated IEDs that have harmed our troops. And I'd like to repeat, I do not know whether or not the Quds Force was ordered from the top echelons of government. But my point is what's worse – them ordering it and it happening, or them not ordering it and it happening? And so we will continue to protect our troops. ... to say it [...] is provoking Iran is just a wrong way to characterize the Commander-in-Chief's decision to do what is necessary to protect our soldiers in harm's way. And I will continue to do so. ... Whether Ahmadinejad ordered the Quds force to do this, I don't think we know. But we do know that they're there, and I intend to do something about it. And I've <b>asked</b> <b>our</b> commanders to do something about it. And we're going to protect our troops. ... I don't think we know who {{picked up the phone and}} said to the Quds Force, go do this, but we know it's a vital part of the Iranian government. …What matters is, is that we're responding. The idea that somehow we're manufacturing the idea that the Iranians are providing IEDs is preposterous. ... My job is to protect our troops. And when we find devices that are in that country that are hurting our troops, we're going to do something about it, pure and simple. ... does this mean you're trying to have a pretext for war? No. It means I'm trying to protect our troops." ...|$|E
