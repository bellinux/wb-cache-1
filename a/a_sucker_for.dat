500|$|Lynch {{described}} {{the attractiveness of}} the idea of a pilot, despite the knowledge that the medium of television would be constricting: [...] "I'm <b>a</b> <b>sucker</b> <b>for</b> a continuing story... Theoretically, you can get a very deep story and you can go so deep and open the world so beautifully, but it takes time to do that." [...] The story included normal and surreal elements, much like Lynch's earlier series Twin Peaks. Groundwork was laid for story arcs, such as the mystery of Rita's identity, Betty's career and Adam Kesher's film project.|$|E
500|$|... "The Master Plan" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Matt Fowler of IGN {{said the}} budget problems created strong character development potential for Leslie and comedic opportunities for Ron. Fowler also enjoyed that the normally-dissolute Tom formed an authentic romantic connection, and said Chris Pratt brought [...] "a certain naturalness" [...] to {{a role that}} could otherwise have been overly idiotic. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club strongly praised the episode, praising Rob Lowe and the entire regular cast. He declared Parks and Recreation the best television show since Arrested Development, and said, [...] "As much as I like the '50 jokes a minute' style of comedies ... I'm <b>a</b> <b>sucker</b> <b>for</b> a show where the characters are as well-wrought and as purely funny as they are on this show." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall praised {{the implementation of the}} new characters, particularly the fact that the script did not rely too heavily on them. Sepinwall also said the episode balanced well the workplace humor with the romantic subplots between Leslie and Ben, April and Andy, and Ann and Chris.|$|E

500|$|Nando Di Fino of Mediaite also {{complained that}} the episode may have gone too far, and {{compared}} it to previous episodes in the series that had been banned from airing on television, noting, [...] "The show has dipped into sensitive material before, and Fox has actually refused to air two episodes — one dealing with abortion, the other with heavy Jewish themes. Sunday night's episode, if reaction to {{it can be used}} as a good measure, may have been better joining those two episodes in exile." [...] Whitney Jefferson of Jezebel, a website centered on women's issues, also strongly criticized the episode for its storyline involving Brenda and her boyfriend, Jeff: [...] "Personally, I'm way beyond being offended by the show — I've long been numbed to shock-value offensiveness — and had stopped watching years ago anyhow. But being <b>a</b> <b>sucker</b> <b>for</b> a Halloween-themed episodes, I tuned in to Fox's [...] "Animation Domination" [...] comedy block last night. What I saw was seriously awful."

Julia Leconte of Now opined that the song was [...] "classic Beyoncé feminism" [...] and quipped, [...] "and if you're <b>a</b> <b>sucker</b> <b>for</b> girl-power hits like 'Irreplaceable', you'll have this one on repeat, too". While Claire Lobenfield of Complex stated, [...] "What sounds like a classic Beyoncé female empowerment ballad cuts even deeper." [...] Tim Finney of the same publication deemed the song a [...] "heavy-handed future concert staple". Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Mikael Wood felt that with [...] "Pretty Hurts," [...] Beyoncé created [...] "razzle-dazzle pop out of small-scale sentiments that might've seemed on paper like fodder for hushed ballads". [...] Drowned in Sound writer Robert Leedham stated the track was [...] "impeccably sung".|$|E
500|$|Although the {{characters}} were separated on screen, they had gained a fan {{base on the}} Internet that believed Martha should be with Jack and wanted the pair to reunite. Gordon herself backed the pairing, stating that she believed they should be together. She said: [...] "I actually love Jack and Martha together, I'm <b>a</b> <b>sucker</b> <b>for</b> romance so, I want {{want them to be}} together [...] I want them to continue on, [...] the timing is not right, they are not mature enough. Jack's in a relationship with someone else as Martha is, there just seems to be things {{getting in the way of}} them getting back together all the time." [...] Gordon also hoped for a happy ending for the two characters if they were to ever leave the serial adding: [...] "If I had it my way, and I got to write the scripts then I'd make it happily ever after, Martha and Jack riding off into the sunset." [...] Gordon has spoken of her understanding from the audiences point of view, that together Jack and Martha are [...] "the ultimate couple". She also reiterated her belief that it would be to tough at the time of Martha's downward spiral for them to work together, but if Martha is to get through her troubles and have a happy ending, that it would be with Jack. The Daily Telegraph commented on the Martha and Jack situation, saying it is played out in a [...] "classic soapie technique". They said [...] "Bring {{the characters}} together, push them apart, but always leave open the possibility that they could get back together.

500|$|Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly was {{generally}} positive {{on most of}} the songs featured in the episode. She gave the performance of [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] a [...] "B", and explained that [...] "This one took a little time to grow on me.

2500|$|Long {{involved}} in liberal politics, Garfield {{was caught up}} in the communist scare of the late 1940s and early 1950s. He supported the Committee for the First Amendment, which opposed governmental investigation of political beliefs. When called to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, which was empowered to investigate communist infiltration in America, Garfield refused to name communist party members or followers, testifying that, indeed, he knew none in the film industry. Garfield rejected communism, and just prior to his death in hopes of redeeming himself {{in the eyes of the}} blacklisters, wrote that he had been duped by communist ideology in an unpublished article called [...] "I Was <b>a</b> <b>Sucker</b> <b>for</b> a Left Hook", a reference to Garfield's movies about boxing.
