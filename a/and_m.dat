In India, for example, the species spends the summer between 1,500 <b>m</b> <b>and</b> 2,100 <b>m,</b> but was observed during winter at just 335 <b>m</b> in Sikkim <b>and</b> in northeastern Arunachal Pradesh at 460 <b>m</b> <b>and</b> between 600 <b>m</b> <b>and</b> 800 <b>m.</b> In Burma, they were observed at between 975 <b>m</b> <b>and</b> 1,830 <b>m,</b> in China between 350 <b>m</b> <b>and</b> 1,975 <b>m,</b> in Laos between 1,950 <b>m</b> <b>and</b> 2,000 <b>m</b> <b>and</b> in Thailand, the only observation of the species was at a height of 2,290 m.|$|R

5|$|M. browni, M. harriesi, <b>and</b> <b>M.</b> schwarzi {{were all}} {{found in the}} Upper Elliot Formation of Cape Province, South Africa. All three are based on fragmentary material, and were {{regarded}} as indeterminate {{in the most recent}} review. M. browni is based on two cervical, two back, and three caudal vertebrae and miscellaneous hind limb elements. M. harriesi is known from a well-preserved forelimb and parts of a hindlimb. M. schwarzi is known from an incomplete hind limb and sacrum. M. hislopi <b>and</b> <b>M.</b> rawesi were named from fossils found in India. M. hislopi is based on vertebrae from the Upper Triassic Maleri Formation of Andhra Pradesh, whereas M. rawesi is based on a tooth from the Upper Cretaceous Takli Formation of Maharashtra. M. hislopi was tentatively retained as an indeterminate sauropodomorph in the latest review, but M. rawesi may be a theropod or nondinosaur. M. huenei is a combination derived by Cooper for Lufengosaurus huenei, as he considered Lufengosaurus and Massospondylus to be synonyms. This synonymy is no longer accepted.|$|E

5|$|One {{synonym for}} the species has been {{published}} – Ponera ruginoda (also titled Myrmecia ruginoda), described by Smith in the same work, and a male holotype specimen was originally described for this synonym. Ponera ruginoda was initially placed into the genera Ectatomma and Rhytidoponera, but it was later classified as a junior synonym of the jack jumper ant, after specimens of each were compared. The ant {{is a part of}} the Myrmecia pilosula species complex, a species group that was first defined by Italian entomologist Carlo Emery. The species complex is a monophyletic group, where the species are closely related to each other but their actual genetic relationship is distant. Members of this group include M. apicalis, M. chasei, M. chrysogaster, M. croslandi, M. cydista, M. dispar, M. elegans, M. harderi, M. ludlowi, M. michaelseni, M. occidentalis M. queenslandica, M. rugosa <b>and</b> <b>M.</b> varians.
