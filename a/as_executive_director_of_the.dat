5|$|PTC {{was founded}} in 1995 by {{longtime}} political activist L. Brent Bozell III. Bozell is a prominent conservative activist who has, among other things, served <b>as</b> <b>Executive</b> <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Conservative Victory Committee, a political action committee that has supported the election of dozens of conservative candidates {{over the past ten}} years. He was also National Finance Chairman for Pat Buchanan's 1992 presidential campaign, and later president of the National Conservative Political Action Committee. Bozell was succeeded as PTC President by Timothy F. Winter. Winter served <b>as</b> <b>Executive</b> <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PTC for three years prior to becoming president. Prior to joining the PTC, Mr. Winter's 20-year career as a media executive included positions with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and NBC. Until 2015 when his position was terminated, Dan Isett, Director of Corporate and Government Affairs of the PTC, represented the PTC on the Consumer Advisory Committee of the Federal Communications Commission.|$|E

5|$|Clements {{never again}} sought an elected office after his defeat by Morton, though he {{remained}} active in state politics {{and continued to}} lead the anti-Chandler faction of his party. From 1957 to 1959, {{at the insistence of}} Lyndon Johnson, he served <b>as</b> <b>executive</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States Senate Democratic Campaign Committee and helped ensure the election of a fourteen-seat Democratic majority in the Senate. He considered running for governor again in 1959, but ultimately decided against it. Without Clements in the race, the anti-Chandler faction was unable to unite behind either former candidate Bert T. Combs or former Louisville mayor Wilson Wyatt. Clements united the faction behind Combs, making Wilson Wyatt their candidate for lieutenant governor and promising him support for later races. Combs defeated the Chandler candidate, Harry Lee Waterfield in the Democratic primary and {{went on to win the}} general election.|$|E

5|$|In 1947, Clements succeeded Willis as governor, {{defeating}} Harry Lee Waterfield, Chandler's preferred candidate, in the Democratic primary. As governor, Clements {{raised taxes}} {{and used the}} revenue to increase funding for the state park system and construct and maintain more roads. He also achieved advancements in education, including some progress toward desegregation. In 1950, Clements {{was elected to the}} U.S. Senate. He resigned as governor to accept his Senate seat. While in the Senate, he served as Democratic party whip under party leader Lyndon Johnson and <b>as</b> <b>executive</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Senate Democratic Reelection Committee from 1957 to 1959. He was defeated by Thruston Morton in his re-election bid in 1956; a lack of support from Chandler (then serving his second term as governor) contributed to Clements' defeat. At Johnson's insistence, Clements resumed chairing the Senate Democratic Reelection Committee in 1957 and 1959.|$|E
5|$|Because he owed few favors to the state's {{established}} politicians, many of Brown's top appointees were businesspeople. Keeping {{a campaign}} promise {{to appoint a}} woman and an African-American to his cabinet, Brown named William E. McAnulty Jr., and Jacqueline Swigart to his cabinet. McAnulty resigned his post {{as secretary of the}} state's Department of Justice within one month, saying the position would keep him from spending enough time with his family. Brown re-appointed McAnulty to his former position as a judge with the Jefferson County District Court and replaced him with another African-American, George W. Wilson. He also appointed Viola Davis Brown <b>as</b> <b>Executive</b> <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Office of Public Health Nursing – in 1980, she was the first African-American nurse to lead a state office of public health nursing in the U.S. His most controversial appointment was Frank Metts, his secretary of transportation. Metts broke with political tradition in Kentucky, announcing that contracts would be awarded on the basis of competitive bids and performance rather than political patronage. Despite cutting personnel from the department, Metts doubled the miles of road that were resurfaced.|$|E
