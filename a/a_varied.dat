Despite his dislike of having his work adapted for the musical theatre ("my plays set themselves to a verbal music of their own") two of his plays were turned into musical comedies: Arms and the Man was the basis of The Chocolate Soldier in 1908, with music by Oscar Straus, and Pygmalion was adapted in 1956 as My Fair Lady with book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner and music by Frederick Loewe. Although he had a high regard for Elgar, Shaw turned down the composer's request for an opera libretto, but played a major part in persuading the BBC to commission Elgar's Third Symphony, and was the dedicatee of The Severn Suite (1930).|$|E

In 1936 he was posted to Palestine, where he helped organise the British repression of the 1936 Arab uprising.

5|$|Cyptotrama asprata (alternatively spelled aspratum), {{commonly}} known as the golden-scruffy collybia, is a saprobic species of mushroom in the family Physalacriaceae.

This fungus has had <b>a</b> <b>varied</b> taxonomical history, having been placed in fourteen genera before finally settling in Cyptotrama. This species is differentiated from several other similar members of genus Cyptotrama by variations in cap color, and spore size and shape.|$|E

5|$|Dinosaurs are <b>a</b> <b>varied</b> {{group of}} animals from taxonomic, {{morphological}} and ecological standpoints. Birds, at over 10,000 living species, are the most diverse group of vertebrates besides perciform fish. Using fossil evidence, paleontologists have identified over 500 distinct genera and more than 1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are represented on every continent by both extant species (birds) and fossil remains. Through {{the first half of}} the 20th century, before birds were recognized to be dinosaurs, most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been sluggish and cold-blooded. Most research conducted since the 1970s, however, has indicated that all dinosaurs were active animals with elevated metabolisms and numerous adaptations for social interaction. Some are herbivorous, others carnivorous. Evidence suggests that egg laying and nest building are additional traits shared by all dinosaurs.|$|E
