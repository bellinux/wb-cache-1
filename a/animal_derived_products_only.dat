We therefore mixed diesel with animal by-products and other <b>derived</b> <b>products</b> not intended for humans in different percentages so as to obtain suitable viscosity. To achieve this, we carried out a study of the miscibility of animal by-products in diesel. We subsequently performed a series of combustion experiments for mixtures of diesel and animal by-products, in varying (a) percentage of by-products in diesel, (b) injection pressure and (c) excess air in combustion. We analysed the experimental combustion results based on (a) energy efficiency of combustion, (b) CO and NO x [...] emissions and (c) fossil-based greenhouse effect gases. Finally, we present the conclusions that combustion of mixed diesel with animal by-products and other <b>derived</b> <b>products</b> not intended for humans for use as boiler fuel low power does not require specific technology when using a conventional fuel oil burner for proper combustion. One only needs to adjust the burner factors: pressure and air flow. In the study of the combustion of mixtures, once the burner factor is adjusted, it appears that the combustion efficiency and greenhouse gas and emission gases are acceptable. The costs of removing fat through incineration or landfill range from 34 to 59 €/ton. The solution proposed in this work not only avoided the cost but also mentioned the value of residue use as fuel.|$|R

40|$|Background: Autologous keratincoytes are {{routinely}} expanded using irradiated mouse fibroblasts and bovine serum for clinical use. With growing {{concerns about the}} safety of these xenobiotic materials, it is desirable to culture keratinocytes in media without <b>animal</b> <b>derived</b> <b>products.</b> An improved understanding of epithelial/mesenchymal interactions could assist in this. Methodology/Principal Findings: A keratincyte/fibroblast o-culture model was developed by extending an agent-based keratinocyte colony formation model to include the response of keratinocytes to both fibroblasts and serum. The model was validated by comparison of the in virtuo and in vitro multicellular behaviour of keratinocytes and fibroblasts in single and co-culture in Greens medium. To test the robustness of the model, several properties of the fibroblasts were changed to investigate their influence on the multicellular morphogenesis of keratinocyes and fibroblasts. The model was then used to generate hypotheses to explore the interactions of both proliferative and growth arrested fibroblasts with keratinocytes. The key predictions arising from the model which were confirmed by in vitro experiments were that 1) the ratio of fibroblasts to keratinocytes would critically influence keratinocyte colony expansion, 2) this ratio needed to be optimum {{at the beginning of the}} co-culture, 3) proliferative fibroblasts would be more effective than irradiated cells in expanding keratinocytes and 4) in the presence of an adequate number of fibroblasts, keratinocyte expansion would be independen...|$|R
40|$|Background and Design: Aphtous {{stomatitis}} is {{a common}} condition mostly seen in children and adolescents. Etiology {{is believed to be}} multifactorial with the influence of both familial and acquired conditions. Food as an etiologic factor has been studied previously with some contradictory findings although patients usually accuse one or more foods, additives and bevareges as a causative factor. In this study we aimed to determine the prevalence of aphtae and its possible relation with dietary habits in a group of university students. Factors like tooth-brushing, antibiotic consumption and body mass indexes are also investigated. Material and Method: A total of 212 university students were given food frequency questionnaire. They are also questioned for the type, frequency and location of aphtous lesions, presence of family history, their height, weight, tooth brushing habits and frequency ao antibiotic consumption. Results: Almost half of the students had aphtae whereas 20. 3 % had three or more a year. Students with aphtae had lower body weight while out of 6 vegeterian students 4 had aphtae. On the other hand toothbrushing or antibiotic consumption were not related with aphtae. Walnut, chocolate and dark bread seemed to be protective against aphtae whereas aphtae were more commonly seen in students consuming more tea and spices. Conclusion: This study showed that <b>animal</b> <b>derived</b> <b>products,</b> walnut and dark bread may be protective against aphtae.

Abstract：The {{invention}} discloses an adhesive bandage type artificial active tissue {{constructed by}} using a culture solution without serum or bovine pituitary extracts and a construction method of the adhesive bandage type artificial active tissue. A cell culture solution without the serum or bovine pituitary extracts is adopted, and a biological film carrier is specially treated {{to ensure that a}} niche suitable for cell interaction is formed on a biological film, and promote human fibroblasts and epidermal cells to give play to self potentials, proliferate, disintegrate and excrete growth factors, so that an artificial tissue with active cells can be formed on the biological film in 4 - 7 days. The artificial tissue is high in cell activity and strong in division and migration ability, can home back to wound surfaces, and can promote tissue regeneration by serving as seed cells for curing burns and chronic ulcer. The adhesive bandage type artificial active tissue disclosed by the invention completely avoids immunological rejection of <b>animal</b> <b>derived</b> <b>products</b> including serum, pituitary extracts and collagen and the risk of infection of viruses transmitted to humans from animals, and a thin cell tissue taking the biological film as a scaffold and an infection barrier is formed, so that the adhesive bandage type artificial active tissue with biological safety is truly realized...|$|R
40|$|At {{the end of}} 2004, {{during a}} routine {{monitoring}} project, high levels of PCDDs in milk from two farms were found. Using a bioassay and the congener patterns obtained by HRGC/HRMS, the source was {{traced back to the}} use of kaolinic clay for sorting potatoes in a production process of French fries. Rest products, especially peelings after scrubbing, were used as feed for dairy cows. Levels of PCCD/Fs in this product amounted to 44 ng WHO 1998 -TEQ kg(- 1) (88 % dw). The maximum level observed in milk was 20 pg WHO 1998 -TEQ g(- 1) fat. A Physiologically Based PharmacoKinetic (PB-PK) model was used to model three data obtained before eliminating the source in order to estimate the starting time of the contamination of the cows, the steady-state level after prolonged contamination and the kinetics of the decrease in the levels after removal of the source. Samples of milk were continuously collected for several months showing a decrease to levels below the product limit of 3 pg WHO 1998 -TEQ g(- 1) fat within 2 months, in excellent agreement with the decrease predicted by the PB-PK model. Different batches of clay were sampled and analysed, showing varying levels of especially PCDDs. All clays were confirmed to be kaolinic clay using X-ray analysis. Other by-products used for animal feed were also contaminated and led to precautionary measures at a few hundred farms, especially pig farms.

40|$|Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a {{biopolymer}} with valuable {{applications in}} the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry. Currently, HA is produced commercially by either extraction from animal tissues i. e. rooster comb or bacterial fermentation. Increased concerns over the contamination of <b>animal</b> <b>derived</b> <b>products</b> with infectious agents have made bacterial fermentation a more desirable production system to meet future demands. The high viscosity of HA dictates low titres of 5 - 10 g/L, a level readily achieved through batch fermentation of Group C streptococci. Substrate cost is a minor factor for this high value polymer, hence strain and process development has focused on improving quality, in particular molecular weight. Little is known about what controls molecular weight of beta-polysaccharides such as HA. This is even true for abundant beta-polysaccharides such as chitin and cellulose. Several groups including ours have pursued various hypotheses for the past decade, but no hypothesis has captured the Mw regulation observed in bioreactors. The HA synthase is responsible for all steps in polymerisation and most likely also translocation. In vitro studies have identified several residues essential for high molecular weight and maximum molecular weight {{appears to be an}} intrinsic feature of the synthase. The actual molecular weight realised in fermentation, however, depends on fermentation conditions. In general, high molecular weight is observed under conditions with excess resources. Surprisingly, however, preliminary studies cannot relate these findings to higher levels of the UDP-sugars used in biosynthesis. Metabolic engineering and the recent advance in omics technologies are providing new opportunities. Heterologous hosts such as B. subtilis, L. lactis, and E. coli have been successfully engineered to produce HA and may prove more amenable to engineering high molecular weight HA...|$|R

Drugs insensitive to such antibodies, either recombinant or plasma-derived, are called factor VIII "by-passing" agents and used for treatment of bleeding in people with inhibitors. OBJECTIVES:To determine the clinical effectiveness of recombinant FVIIa concentrate in comparison to plasma-derived concentrates {{for the treatment of}} acute bleeding episodes in people with haemophilia and inhibitors. SEARCH STRATEGY:We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Coagulopathies Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Trials Register: 07 July 2010. SELECTION CRITERIA:Randomised (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials comparing recombinant FVIIa concentrate (rFVIIa) to human plasma-derived concentrates (high-dose human or recombinant FVIII or FIX concentrate; prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs); activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC)) in persons with haemophilia. Comparisons with <b>animal</b> <b>derived</b> <b>products</b> were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:Two authors independently assessed trials (eligibility and risk of bias) and extracted data.

In this paper we review those articles, which have reported non-linear radiocaesium transfer and also analyse novel data.

The methods will be: multi-group and multi-residue, able to determinate a lot of compounds exhibiting different chemical and physical properties, applicable to several matrices. During the first step of the project, a practical workshop organised by e CRL will be carried out, to transfer the scientific and technical know how already available. For sample treatment, the potency and relative merits of SPE, ASE, QUECHERS system will be tested for extraction and purification steps. This approach should also allow for reducing analysis time, costs and wastes of solvents. Test methods will be validated according to the SANCO/ 2007 / 3131 guideline from the Commission, integrated with the requirements of the Regulation 882 / 2004 /EC and the Decision 2002 / 657 /EC, with particular reference to the case of feeds. Regarding speciation of mercury and its organic form, test methods will be developed for determination of methyl-mercury in seafood and feeds for aquaculture, based on LC-ICP/MS, LC-FIMS/AAS techniques. The methods will be validated according to the Regulation 882 / 2004 /EC. The ratio total mercury /methyl- mercury in some seafood will be evaluated. A model for risk evaluation, managing and communication will be studied to assess consumer#s exposure due to some seafood...|$|R

For some supply chains, like for soy and its <b>derived</b> <b>products</b> {{that are used in}} the production of feed, manufacturers have to face both non-GM and GM production, although there are no labeling requirements for <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> <b>derived</b> from <b>animals</b> fed with GMOs. This study presents the strategies of stakeholders involved in the feed production chain to maintain concurrent production of compound feed with GM and non-GM soy products, by dealing with the coexistence between those two crops. The stakeholders include importers, traders, soy processors, feed processors and retailers. The study shows that many tools are in place to ensure andmaintain the current coexistence. However, a profound harmonization of procedures and methods at a European level should be encouraged...|$|R
5|$|Some {{processes}} {{convert a}} meat or dairy product into a pareve (neither meat nor dairy) one. For example, rennet is sometimes made from stomach linings, yet is acceptable for making kosher cheese, but such cheeses {{might not be}} acceptable to some vegetarians, who would eat only cheese made from a vegetarian rennet. The same applies to kosher gelatin, an <b>animal</b> <b>product,</b> <b>derived</b> from kosher <b>animal</b> sources. Other gelatin-like products from non-animal sources such as agar agar and carrageenan are pareve by nature. Fish gelatin is derived from fish and is therefore (like all kosher fish products) pareve. Eggs are also considered pareve despite being an animal product.|$|R

However, the current methods of hES cell culture limit {{their use in}} future applications due mostly to the inability to culture undifferentiated hES cells in sufficient numbers and the concern of <b>animal</b> <b>derived</b> <b>products</b> used in culture methods potentially implementing an immune rejection in transplantiation recipients. This project investigated two approaches for improving the culture of undifferentiated hES cells for future application in bioreactor systems. Firstly, proteins from the conditioned medium of three hES cell supportive fibroblast lines (human fetal, human neonatal and mouse embryonic fibroblasts) were identified using two-dimensional liquid chromatography, tandem mass spectrometry. This proteomic analysis identified 175 unique proteins including those from key pathways already implicated in the maintenance of human embryonic stem cell pluripotency including the Wnt, BMP/TGF-&# 946; 1, activin/inhibin and insulin like growth factor- 1 pathways. Identification of proteins in fibroblast conditioned medium will aid {{the development of a}} defined medium for undifferentiated hES cell culture. The second approach examined culture of hES cells in hypoxic conditions (5 % O 2) compared to standard normoxic conditions in CO 2 incubators (20 % O 2). Feeder layer and feeder free culture conditions were examined in the two O 2 concentrations. hES cell colonies grown in hypoxic culture had improved percentages of pluripotent cells (judged by increases in cells expressing SSEA- 4, Tra- 1 - 60 and nanog and reduction of BMP- 4), stable karyotypes and increased proliferation. The maintenance of pluripotency, apoptosis and proliferation was complicated by the detection of the cell surface marker CD 30. Proteomic identification and investigation into oxidative stress indicated the presence of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutases, catalases and peroxiredoxins in human fetal fibroblast conditioned medium and their regulation of redox homeostasis may {{play a significant role in}} the maintenance of hES cell pluripotency, apoptosis and proliferation. Together these investigations significantly contribute to the current body of knowledge for the undifferentiated culture of hES cells. Identification of conditioned medium proteins and the benefits of hypoxic culture of hES cells will aid the development of a defined, reproducible method of hES cell scale-up in bioreactor systems...|$|R
