40|$|Aim: The overall aim was {{to explore}} and {{evaluate}} rheumatology nursing from a person-centred care perspective in patients undergoing biological therapy. Methods: This thesis focuses on patients with chronic inflammatory arthritis (CIA) who were undergoing biological therapy at a rheumatology clinic in Sweden. Papers I and II had an explorative descriptive design with a phenomenographic approach. The 40 participants were interviewed about their dependence on or independence of a nurse for the administration of their infusions or injections. Paper III had a randomized controlled design involving 107 patients in the trial. The objective of the intervention was to replace every second monitoring visit at a rheumatologist-led clinic by {{a visit to a}} nurse-led rheumatology clinic, based on person-centred care. Paper IV had an explorative descriptive design with a qualitative content analysis approach. Interviews were conducted with 20 participants who attended the nurse-led rheumatology clinic. Findings: Dependence on a rheumatology nurse for administration of intravenous infusions was described as invigorating due to the regular contact with the nurse, which provided security and involvement (paper I). Independence of a nurse for subcutaneous injections was understood by the patients in different ways and was <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> <b>struggling</b> to cope with injecting themselves, learning about and participating in drug treatment (paper II). Patients with stable CIA receiving biological therapy were monitored by a nurse-led rheumatology clinic without any difference in outcome when compared to monitoring carried out at a rheumatologist-led clinic, as measured by the Disease Activity Score 28. Replacing one of the two annual rheumatologist outpatient follow-up visits by a visit to a nurse-led clinic for the monitoring of biological therapy was found to be safe and effective (paper III). A nurse-led rheumatology clinic, based on person-centred care, added value to the follow-up care of patients with stable CIA undergoing biological therapy by providing a sense of security, familiarity and participation (paper IV). Conclusions: This thesis contributes a valuable insight into person-centred care as the core of rheumatology nursing in the area of biological therapy. The rheumatology nurse adds value to patient care when she/he gives patients an opportunity to talk about themselves as a person and allow their illness narrative to constitute a starting point for building collaboration, which encourages and empowers patients to be an active part in their biological therapy and become autonomous. A nurse who provides person-centred care and keeps the patients’ resources and needs in focus serves as an important guide during their healthcare journey...|$|R

50|$|To {{allow for}} the {{systematic}} integration of the pragmatic and dialectical dimensions {{in the study of}} argumentation, the pragma-dialectical theory uses four meta-theoretical principles as its point of departure: functionalization, socialization, externalization and dialectification.

Externalization is <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> capturing the propositional and interactional commitments created by the speech acts performed.
