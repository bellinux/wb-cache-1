50|$|Aaron Fish {{was born}} in the 1930s in Montreal, Quebec. He was the Chairman and CEO of Unican Security Systems Ltd. from its {{creation}} in 1965 to its sale in December 2000. He worked for his father in his early years as a locksmith. By the time he was 17 and had graduated from high school, he was operating as a <b>key</b> <b>and</b> <b>lock</b> distributor. From 1949 to 1960, Fish became the largest <b>key</b> <b>and</b> <b>lock</b> distributor in Montreal.|$|R

50|$|Today, {{the museum}} focuses on five main areas: {{the natural history}} of New England, American art, Native American art and culture, American history and culture, and farming implements. Notable items in the SM&NC {{permanent}} collections include totem poles from a World's fair, telescopes, outdoor sculptures, farm tools, Native American artifacts, Andy Warhol and Salvador Dalí prints, vintage local pedal cars, antique Yale & Towne <b>keys</b> <b>and</b> <b>locks,</b> <b>and</b> works by Stamford artists Gutzon Borglum and Reuben Nakian.|$|R
50|$|The large {{variety of}} <b>keys</b> <b>and</b> <b>locks</b> from the {{settlement}} is remarkable.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new single key-lock {{mechanism}} {{based on the}} concept of an access control matrix. In this system, each file is given a <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> each user is given a <b>key</b> <b>and</b> through simple operations on <b>keys</b> <b>and</b> <b>locks</b> the user <b>access</b> privilege can be revealed. We use Chinese Remainder theorem and tribes of Farey fractions in this method instead of the method based on Euler’s Theorem of Number Theory used by Chang [2]. An advantage of our method is the ease with which coding can be done for the <b>locking</b> mechanism <b>and</b> for the much larger number of users and files...|$|R
40|$|Entity {{authentication}} becomes ubiquitously {{necessary in}} pervasive computing environments. We provide taxonomy of entity authentication between <b>keys</b> <b>and</b> <b>locks.</b> Based on the discussion, we propose a novel authentication approach for pervasive computing environments. A person uses a single device, the Master Key, which aggregates all his digital keys for entity authentication. The Master <b>Key</b> initiates authentication <b>and</b> selects proper <b>keys</b> by exchanging code words with locks. With {{an emphasis on}} usability, the Master Key secures authentication, keeps authentication private, and supports various key-lock interactions. We analyze privacy and security properties, verify the protocols, and measured performance...|$|R

It is the first book in the Embassy Row series set {{in and around the}} {{diplomatic}} quarter of a Mediterranean capital city. The concept for the book was in the making from 2007, but only began being written in 2013. [...] The second book of the series, See How They Run, was released on December 22, 2015. The third, and final book in the series, Take The <b>Key</b> <b>And</b> <b>Lock</b> Her Up, was released at the end of December, 2016; with some regions getting it in January, 2017.|$|R

40|$|AbstractA new dynamic {{access control}} scheme for {{information}} protection systems is proposed in this paper. The main {{idea of it}} is inspired by {{the concept of the}} trapdoor knapsack problem proposed by Merkle and Hellman. Since the knapsack problem is an NP-complete problem, the security of access control is achieved henceforth. Our scheme associates each user with some user <b>keys</b> <b>and</b> each file with some file keys. There is a positive integer set of S′; through a simple formula on <b>keys</b> <b>and</b> S′, the corresponding access privilege can be easily revealed in the protection system. Moreover, by employing our scheme, insertion or deletion of the user/file can be processed effectively with only a few previously defined <b>keys</b> <b>and</b> <b>locks</b> required to be modified...|$|R
50|$|The {{basement}} of the museum is devoted to objects excavated which relate {{a significant amount of}} information about the daily life of the people of ancient Dion, with objects used by them in daily life, and also includes more statues and items of worship from the surrounding regional unit. The museum has a wide selection of vases <b>and</b> jugs, ancient <b>keys</b> <b>and</b> <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> stone processing tools such as hammers and chisels. A number of notable mosaics were also discovered in a complex known as the Dionysos House. Of particular note is the item known as the Mosaic of Dionysus. However the special feature, given its own room on the upper floor, is the hydraulis or water organ, which is the first organ of its kind found in Greece and the oldest found to date anywhere in the world. The organ was described by Hero of Alexandria and Vitruvius.|$|R
5000|$|Alice Walker, to {{the subject}} of much criticism, demeaned Woolf's essay for its {{exclusion}} of women of color, and women writers who do not have any means for obtaining the independence of a room of their own. In In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens: Womanist Prose, Walker writes:"Virginia Woolf, in her book A Room of One's Own, wrote that in order for a woman to write fiction she must have two things, certainly: a room of her own (with <b>key</b> <b>and</b> <b>lock)</b> <b>and</b> enough money to support herself.What then {{are we to make of}} Phillis Wheatley, a slave, who owned not even herself?

50|$|The Actor climbs {{down from}} his bunk and {{declares}} that the doctor has told him he has an organ poisoned by alcohol, and sweeping the floor would be bad for his health. Anna coughs loudly in her bunk. She is dying of consumption—there is no hope for her.

5000|$|By November 1688, Enniskillen and Derry {{were the}} two garrisons in Ulster that were not wholly loyal to James and these became {{the focal point of}} the first stage in the Williamite war in Ireland. The elderly Alexander MacDonnell, 3rd Earl of Antrim, a Jacobite, was ordered to replace these two garrisons with forces loyal to King James. He agreed, but wasted several weeks searching for men who were at least six feet tall. A force of about 1,200 Scottish Highland [...] "Redshanks" [...] then set out for Derry. On 7 December, with the army a short {{distance}} away, thirteen apprentice boys seized the city <b>keys</b> <b>and</b> <b>locked</b> the gates.|$|R
60|$|All these {{particulars}} {{he remembered}} {{in that moment}} of agony, and resolved {{what he would do}} to overcome the difficulties which they threw in his way. Having passed through the gate, he dropped his now senseless companion beneath the shelter of the wall, and passing his hands through the bars, turned the <b>key</b> <b>and</b> <b>locked</b> it. He then took out a short hunting-knife which he wore, and passing that also through the bars of the gate, he inserted it in the handle of the <b>key,</b> <b>and</b> then wrenching it round with all his force, broke the key in the wards: all the smiths in Poitou could not have locked the gate closer, or made it more impossible to open it.|$|R
50|$|Physical {{access control}} {{is a matter of}} who, where, and when. An access control system determines who is allowed to enter or exit, where they are allowed to exit or enter, and when they are allowed to enter or exit. Historically, this was {{partially}} accomplished through <b>keys</b> <b>and</b> <b>locks.</b> When a door is locked, only someone with a key can enter through the door, depending on how the lock is configured. Mechanical <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>keys</b> do not allow restriction of the key holder to specific times or dates. Mechanical <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>keys</b> do not provide records of the key used on any specific door, <b>and</b> the <b>keys</b> can be easily copied or transferred to an unauthorized person. When a mechanical key is lost or the key holder is no longer authorized to use the protected area, the locks must be re-keyed.|$|R
