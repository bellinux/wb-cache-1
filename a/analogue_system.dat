500|$|The game's {{controls}} were generally well received, despite specific {{issues such as}} difficulties executing very short putts due to the game's power meter. The accessibility of the controls in particular were lauded, although Camelot's choice {{not to use the}} analogue swing present in many golf games was a common complaint. This specifically was compared to the <b>analogue</b> <b>system</b> present in Tiger Woods games, prompting Matt Casamassina to comment [...] "going from Tiger Woods back to the mechanics of Mario Golf feels like going from car to horse". The variety of modes available in Toadstool Tour was rated as [...] "amazing" [...] by GameSpot, who proceeded to commend the clarification provided by the game's manual booklet and in-game tutorial. Eurogamer also noted this by offering praise to [...] "Ring attack", but conversely rated [...] "Coin attack" [...] as [...] "a bit shallow".

The frequent use of such high acceleration and deceleration rates makes for a quick ride, yet one that can occasionally be perilous for non-seated passengers. Automatic station stops are handled by track mounted transponders and can be overridden by the operator for non-stopping trains.|$|E
