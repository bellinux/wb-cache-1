5|$|Bregowine (died August 764) was {{a medieval}} Archbishop of Canterbury. Little {{is known of}} his origins or his {{activities}} as archbishop, although a number of stories were told about his possible origins after the Norman conquest in 1066. There are no records of him prior to his becoming archbishop. He possibly owed his elevation to the Kentish monarch. The records after his elevation to Canterbury are mainly about disputes over land, but knowledge {{of his time in}} office is hampered by the destruction of many of the contemporary records. After his death, he was considered a saint <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> about him was written in the 12thcentury.|$|E

5|$|Some frogs {{have become}} adapted for {{burrowing}} <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> underground. They {{tend to have}} rounded bodies, short limbs, small heads with bulging eyes, and hind feet adapted for excavation.

It emerges briefly during the monsoon to mate and breed in temporary pools. It has a tiny head with a pointed snout and a plump, rounded body. Because of this fossorial existence, it was first described in 2003, being new to the scientific community at that time, although previously known to local people.|$|E

5|$|The game is {{a remake}} of the {{original}} NES Mega Man title and has similar gameplay and level designs. The game moves on a 2D plane and players are given control of the game's eponymous hero Mega Man. Unlike the original's 8-bit graphics, the game uses 3D character models with super deformed designs. Mega Man's primary abilities include jumping and shooting and he is given both a health meter <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> meter. Mega Man can lose health by touching enemies or their projectiles, while lives will be lost when Lives will be consumed if Mega Man touches certain spikes, or falls into a pit. Lives and health can be found either dropped by enemies or in fixed locations.|$|E
5|$|Each dream {{acts as a}} {{character}} study, exploring the fears and future of the dreamer. Willow, Xander, and Giles are stalked by a shadowy figure, then killed within their dreams. The way in which each is killed {{is directly related to}} the role they had assumed when melding with Buffy in the previous episode—that role is indicated by the Tarot-like card used to symbolize the character's essence. Willow's card had been Spiritus, representing her magical powers; she is killed by having her spirit sucked out of her. Xander's card had been Animus, representing his heart; he is killed by having his heart ripped out. Giles had been represented by the card Sophus, a symbol of his intellect and role as teacher; he is killed by being scalped. Buffy's card, Manus, was representative of her physical strength. In her dream the stalker is revealed as the primitive, first slayer, who confronts her aggressively. The two fight, but the First Slayer is defeated when Buffy realizes a key difference between them: the First Slayer was alone and isolated, while Buffy is unique among Slayers in that she has friends <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> beyond slaying, factors which make her the greatest Slayer ever.|$|E
