5|$|Medical {{conditions}} that commonly cause a high-androgen state, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and androgen-secreting tumors, can cause acne in affected individuals. Conversely, people who lack <b>androgenic</b> hormones or are {{insensitive to the}} effects of androgens rarely have acne. An increase in androgen and oily sebum synthesis can be seen during pregnancy. Acne can be a side effect of testosterone replacement therapy or of anabolic steroid use. Over-the-counter bodybuilding and dietary supplements are commonly found to contain illegally added anabolic steroids.|$|E
5|$|The main {{hormonal}} {{driver of}} oily sebum {{production in the}} skin is dihydrotestosterone. Another <b>androgenic</b> hormone responsible for increased sebaceous gland activity is DHEA-S. Higher amounts of DHEA-S are secreted during adrenarche (a stage of puberty), and this leads {{to an increase in}} sebum production. In a sebum-rich skin environment, the naturally occurring and largely commensal skin bacterium P. acnes readily grows and can cause inflammation within and around the follicle due to activation of the innate immune system. P. acnes triggers skin inflammation in acne by increasing the production of several pro-inflammatory chemical signals (such as IL-1α, IL-8, TNF-α, and LTB4); IL-1α is known to be essential to comedo formation.|$|E
5|$|Progestin-only pills, {{injections}} and intrauterine {{devices are}} {{not associated with}} an increased risk of blood clots and may be used by women with previous blood clots in their veins. In those with a history of arterial blood clots, non-hormonal birth control or a progestin-only method other than the injectable version should be used. Progestin-only pills may improve menstrual symptoms and can be used by breastfeeding women as they do not affect milk production. Irregular bleeding may occur with progestin-only methods, with some users reporting no periods. The progestins drospirenone and desogestrel minimize the <b>androgenic</b> side effects but increase the risks of blood clots and are thus not first line. The perfect use first-year failure rate of the injectable progestin, Depo-Provera, is 0.2%; the typical use first failure rate is 6%.|$|E
25|$|The {{capacity}} to be metabolized by 5α-reductase and the AR activity of the resultant metabolites appears {{to be one of}} the major, if not the most important determinant of the androgenic-myotrophic ratio for a given AAS. AAS that are not potentiated by 5α-reductase or that are weakened by 5α-reductase in <b>androgenic</b> tissues have a reduced risk of <b>androgenic</b> side effects such as acne, <b>androgenic</b> alopecia (male-pattern baldness), hirsutism (excessive male-pattern hair growth), benign prostatic hyperplasia (prostate enlargement), and prostate cancer, while incidence and magnitude of other effects such as muscle hypertrophy, bone changes, voice deepening, and changes in sex drive show no difference.|$|E
25|$|The androgenic:anabolic {{ratio of}} an AAS is an {{important}} factor when determining the clinical application of these compounds. Compounds with a high ratio of <b>androgenic</b> to an anabolic effects are the drug of choice in androgen-replacement therapy (e.g., treating hypogonadism in males), whereas compounds with a reduced androgenic:anabolic ratio are preferred for anemia and osteoporosis, and to reverse protein loss following trauma, surgery, or prolonged immobilization. Determination of androgenic:anabolic ratio is typically performed in animal studies, which has led to the marketing of some compounds claimed to have anabolic activity with weak <b>androgenic</b> effects. This disassociation is less marked in humans, where all AAS have significant <b>androgenic</b> effects.|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{cross-sectional}} {{studies have}} found associations between early <b>androgenic</b> alopecia, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome, with low HDL being the component of metabolic syndrome with highest association. Linolenic and linoleic acids, two major dietary sources of HDL, are 5 alpha reductase inhibitors. Premature <b>androgenic</b> alopecia and insulin resistance may be a clinical constellation that represents the male homologue, or phenotype, of polycystic ovary syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Other {{areas of}} the skin are similarly, though {{slightly}} less, sensitive to androgens and <b>androgenic</b> hair typically appears somewhat later. In rough sequence of sensitivity to androgens and appearance of <b>androgenic</b> hair, are the armpits (axillae), perianal area, upper lip, preauricular areas (sideburns), periareolar areas (nipples), middle of the chest, neck under the chin, remainder of chest and beard area, limbs and shoulders, back, and buttocks.|$|E
25|$|In this way, {{androgen}}s {{bound to}} androgen receptors regulate {{the expression of}} target genes, thus produce <b>androgenic</b> effects.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone can be robustly {{converted}} by 5α-reductase into DHT {{in so-called}} <b>androgenic</b> tissues such as skin, scalp, prostate, and seminal vesicles, {{but not in}} muscle or bone, where 5α-reductase either is not expressed or is only minimally expressed. As DHT is 3- to 10-fold more potent as an agonist of the AR than is testosterone, the AR agonist activity of testosterone is thus markedly and selectively potentiated in such tissues. In contrast to testosterone, DHT and other 4,5α-dihydrogenated AAS are already 5α-reduced, and for this reason, cannot be potentiated in <b>androgenic</b> tissues. 19-Nortestosterone derivatives like nandrolone can be metabolized by 5α-reductase similarly to testosterone, but 5α-reduced metabolites of 19-nortestosterone derivatives (e.g., 5α-dihydronandrolone) tend to have reduced activity as AR agonists, resulting in reduced <b>androgenic</b> activity in tissues that express 5α-reductase. In addition, some 19-nortestosterone derivatives, including trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone (MENT)), 11β-methyl-19-nortestosterone (11β-MNT), and dimethandrolone (7α,11β-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone), cannot be 5α-reduced. Conversely, 17α-alkylated AAS can be 5α-reduced and are potentiated in <b>androgenic</b> tissues similarly to testosterone, with an exception being 17α-alkylated AAS that are already 4,5α-reduced.|$|E
25|$|Male pattern {{hair loss}} {{is also known}} as <b>androgenic</b> {{alopecia}}, androgenetic alopecia (AGA), alopecia androgenetica and male pattern baldness (MPB).|$|E
25|$|Progesterone {{does not}} bind to the {{androgen}} receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and hence does not possess any direct <b>androgenic</b> or antiandrogenic activity. This {{is in contrast}} to many progestins, such as 19-nortestosterone derivatives (e.g., norethisterone, dienogest) and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives (e.g., cyproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate), which do bind to the AR and have been associated with <b>androgenic</b> or antiandrogenic effects depending on the progestin in question.|$|E
25|$|NET has {{approximately}} 15% of the affinity of the anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) metribolone (R-1881) for the AR, and in accordance, is weakly <b>androgenic.</b> In {{contrast to}} NET, 5α-DHNET, the major metabolite of NET, shows higher {{affinity for the}} AR, with approximately 27% of the affinity of metribolone. However, although 5α-DHNET has higher affinity for the AR than NET, it has significantly diminished and in fact almost abolished <b>androgenic</b> potency in comparison to NET in rodent bioassays. Similar findings were observed for ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone) and its 5α-reduced metabolite, whereas 5α-reduction enhanced both the AR affinity and <b>androgenic</b> potency of testosterone and nandrolone (19-nortestosterone) in rodent bioassays. As such, {{it appears that the}} ethynyl group of NET at the C17α position is responsible for its loss of androgenicity upon 5α-reduction.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} {{premature}} age effect is Werner's syndrome, {{a condition of}} accelerated aging from low-fidelity copying of mRNA. Affected children display premature <b>androgenic</b> alopecia.|$|E
25|$|Levels of free {{testosterone}} {{are strongly}} linked to libido and DHT levels, but unless free testosterone is virtually nonexistent, levels {{have not been}} shown to affect virility. Men with <b>androgenic</b> alopecia {{are more likely to}} have a higher baseline of free androgens. However, sexual activity is multifactoral, and <b>androgenic</b> profile is not the only determining factor in baldness. Additionally, because hair loss is progressive and free testosterone declines with age, a male's hairline may be more indicative of his past than his present disposition.|$|E
25|$|Dermatological/integumental: oily skin, acne vulgaris, acne conglobata, seborrhea, {{stretch marks}} (due to rapid muscle enlargement), hypertrichosis (excessive hair growth), <b>androgenic</b> {{alopecia}} (pattern hair loss; scalp baldness), fluid retention/edema.|$|E
25|$|Dydrogesterone is {{relatively}} safe and well tolerated, {{and does not}} exhibit the <b>androgenic</b> side effects that are common with some other progestins, like medroxyprogesterone acetate and norethisterone.|$|E
25|$|The {{measurement}} of the dissociation between anabolic and <b>androgenic</b> effects among AAS is based largely on a simple although arguably unsophisticated and outdated model involving rat tissue bioassays. It {{is referred to as}} the myotrophic-androgenic index. In this model, anabolic (myotrophic) activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat bulbocavernosus/levator ani muscle and <b>androgenic</b> activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat ventral prostate (or, alternatively, the rat seminal vesicles) in response to exposure to the AAS, and the measurements are then compared and used to form a ratio.|$|E
25|$|A 2006 Cochrane review did {{not find}} {{evidence}} sufficient {{for the use of}} <b>androgenic</b> anabolic steroids. Corticosteroids are sometimes used; however, this is recommended only when severe liver inflammation is present.|$|E
25|$|Androstenedione (Andro): an <b>androgenic</b> steroid {{produced}} by the testes, adrenal cortex, and ovaries. While androstenediones are converted metabolically to testosterone and other androgens, {{they are also the}} parent structure of estrone.|$|E
25|$|Head hair {{may change}} {{slightly}} in texture, curl, and color. This is especially likely with hair growth from previously bald areas. Eyebrows {{do not change}} {{because they are not}} <b>androgenic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fetal masculinization {{of female}} {{external}} genitalia due to maternal use of <b>androgenic</b> steroids is generally less advanced than {{that due to}} CAH, and unlike CAH, does not cause progressive virilization.|$|E
25|$|DHEA {{and other}} adrenal androgens such as androstenedione, {{although}} relatively weak androgens, {{are responsible for}} the <b>androgenic</b> effects of adrenarche, such as early pubic and axillary hair growth, adult-type body odor, increased oiliness of hair and skin, and mild acne. Women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), who have a non-functional androgen receptor (AR) and are immune to the <b>androgenic</b> effects of DHEA and other androgens, have absent or only sparse/scanty pubic and axillary hair and body hair in general, demonstrating the role of DHEA, testosterone, and other androgens in body hair development at both adrenarche and pubarche.|$|E
25|$|Because of its {{association}} with metabolic syndrome and altered glucose metabolism, {{both men and women}} with early <b>androgenic</b> hair loss should be screened for impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes mellitus.|$|E
25|$|Maternal use of androgens or {{high doses}} of certain weakly <b>androgenic</b> {{synthetic}} progestogens (progestins) structurally related to testosterone can masculinize (virilize) the external genitalia of a female fetus during susceptible times in pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Research {{indicates}} that the initial programming of pilosebaceous units of hair follicles begins in utero. The physiology is primarily <b>androgenic,</b> with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) the major contributor at the dermal papillae. Men with premature <b>androgenic</b> alopecia tend to have lower than normal values of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone, and epitestosterone when compared to men without pattern hair loss. Although hair follicles were previously thought to be permanently gone in areas of complete hair loss, {{they are more likely}} dormant, as recent studies have shown the scalp contains the stem cell progenitor cells from which the follicles arose.|$|E
25|$|When {{appropriate}} (e.g., {{in women}} of child-bearing age who require contraception), a standard contraceptive pill is frequently {{effective in reducing}} hirsutism. Progestogens such as norgestrel and levonorgestrel should be avoided due to their <b>androgenic</b> effects.|$|E
25|$|In {{support of}} the association, {{finasteride}} improves glucose metabolism and decreases glycosylated hemoglobin HbA1c, a surrogate marker for diabetes mellitus. The low SHBG seen with premature <b>androgenic</b> alopecia is also associated with insulin resistance.|$|E
25|$|At high dosages (5 to 60mg/day), for {{instance}} {{those used in}} the treatment of gynecological disorders, NET can cause hypogonadism due to its antigonadotropic effects and can have estrogenic and weak <b>androgenic</b> side effects.|$|E
25|$|Female-pattern {{hair loss}} more often causes diffuse {{thinning}} without hairline recession; similar to its male counterpart, female <b>androgenic</b> alopecia rarely leads to total hair loss. The Ludwig scale grades severity of female-pattern hair loss.|$|E
25|$|As {{their name}} suggests, AAS have two different, but overlapping, types of effects: anabolic, {{meaning that they}} promote {{anabolism}} (cell growth), and <b>androgenic</b> (or virilizing), meaning that they affect the development and maintenance of masculine characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Ketoconazole shampoo in {{conjunction}} with an oral 5α-reductase inhibitor has been used off label to treat <b>androgenic</b> alopecia. The antifungal properties of ketoconazole reduce scalp microflora and consequently may reduce follicular inflammation that contributes to alopecia.|$|E
25|$|As the {{amplitude}} of LH pulses increases, the theca {{cells of the}} ovaries begin to produce testosterone and smaller amounts of progesterone. Much of the testosterone moves into nearby cells called granulosa cells. Smaller increases of FSH induce {{an increase in the}} aromatase activity of these granulosa cells, which converts most of the testosterone to estradiol for secretion into the circulation. The remaining testosterone, together with adrenal androgens is responsible for the typical <b>androgenic</b> changes of female puberty: pubic hair, other <b>androgenic</b> hair as outlined above, body odor, acne. The bioactivity of testosterone is to a large degree limited by SHBG which in turn is mainly controlled by estradiol and prolactin levels (estradiol stimulates, prolactin decreases SHBG synthesis).|$|E
25|$|Fetal masculinization {{of female}} {{external}} genitalia is usually due to enzyme abnormalities involved in adrenal steroid biosynthesis, resulting in congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH); fetal masculinization of female external genitalia {{is much less}} frequently due to maternal use of <b>androgenic</b> steroids.|$|E
25|$|All the {{metabolites}} of dydrogesterone {{retain the}} 4,6-diene-3-one structure, and are metabolically stable. As such, dydrogesterone does not undergo aromatisation, {{which is consistent}} with its absence of estrogenic effects. Furthermore, dydrogesterone does not undergo 17α-hydroxylation, which may contribute to its lack of <b>androgenic</b> effects.|$|E
25|$|Animal {{models of}} <b>androgenic</b> {{alopecia}} occur naturally {{and have been}} developed in transgenic mice; chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes); bald uakaris (Cacajao rubicundus); and stump-tailed macaques (Macaca speciosa and M. arctoides). Of these, macaques have demonstrated the greatest incidence and most prominent degrees of hair loss.|$|E
25|$|NET {{is bound}} to a {{considerable}} extent (36%) to SHBG in circulation. Although it has lower affinity for SHBG than endogenous androgens and estrogens, NET may displace testosterone from SHBG and thereby increase free testosterone levels, and this action may contribute to its weak <b>androgenic</b> effects.|$|E
