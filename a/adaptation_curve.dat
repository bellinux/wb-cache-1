Using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI), we measured motion <b>adaptation</b> tuning <b>curves</b> in a fine scale by probing changes in cortical activity after adaptation for a range of directions relative to the adapted direction. We found a clear dichotomy in tuning curve shape: cortical responses in early-tier visual areas reduced at around both the adapted and opposite direction, resulting in a bi-directional tuning curve, whereas response reduction in high-tier areas occurred only at around the adapted direction, resulting in a uni-directional tuning curve. We also found that the psychophysically measured <b>adaptation</b> tuning <b>curves</b> were uni-directional and best matched the cortical <b>adaptation</b> tuning <b>curves</b> in MT and MST. Our findings are compatible with, but not limited to, an interpretation in which direct impacts of motion adaptation occur in both uni-directional and bi-directional units in early visual areas, but its perceptual consequences are manifested in the population activity in MT and MST, which may inherit those direct impacts of adaptation from the directionally selective units...|$|R

An altered gain of display of pointing movements was used to induce a conflict between visual and somatosensory representations.

Following the adaptation regimen, subjects performed a transfer test in which the shoulder group performed wrist movements and the wrist group performed shoulder movements. The results demonstrated that both groups displayed typical <b>adaptation</b> <b>curves,</b> initially undershooting the target followed by a return to baseline performance. Transfer tests revealed that both groups had high transfer of the acquired adaptation to the other joint. Experiment 2 followed a similar design except that group 1 adapted head pointing movements and group 2 adapted arm pointing movements. The arm adaptation had high transfer to head pointing while the head adaptation had very little transfer to arm pointing.

40|$|The {{effect of}} light and dark {{adaptation}} on the electrical activity in two species of nocturnal gecko, Hemidactylus turcicus and Tarentola mauritanica was studied. The electroretinogram of both species changes from the scotopic type in the dark-adapted state to the photopic type after strong light adaptation. For the scotopic response fusion frequencies up to 18 flashes per sec. are obtained in both species. For the photopic response fusion frequencies up to 50 flashes per sec. are seen in Tarentola, and up to 25 flashes per sec. in Hemidactylus. Proceeding from dark to light adaptation the increment threshold (dI) is measured at different levels of adaptive illumination (I). At low levels of illumination the dI/I ratio is found to be small and at high levels of illumination to be large. No difference in the dI/I ratio is obtained for test lights of 462 and 605 mµ.

40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{analyzed}} the effects of variations in the concentrations of oxygen and of blood sugar on light sensitivity; i. e. dark adaptation. The experiments were carried out in an air-conditioned light-proof chamber where the concentrations of oxygen could be changed by dilution with nitrogen or by inhaling oxygen from a cylinder. The blood sugar was lowered by the injection of insulin and raised by the ingestion of glucose. The dark <b>adaptation</b> <b>curves</b> were plotted from data secured with an apparatus built according to specifications outlined by Hecht and Shlaer. During each experiment, observations were first made in normal air with the subject under basal conditions followed by one, and in most instances two, periods under the desired experimental conditions involving either anoxia or hyper- or hypoglycemia or variations in both the oxygen tension and blood sugar at the same time. 1. Dark <b>adaptation</b> <b>curves</b> were plotted (threshold against time) in normal air and compared with those obtained while inhaling lowered concentrations of oxygen. A decrease in sensitivity was observed with lowered oxygen tensions. Both the rod and cone portions of the curves were influenced in a similar way. These effects were counteracted by inhaling oxygen, the final rod thresholds returning to {{about the level of}} the normal base line in air or even below it within 2 to 3 minutes. The impairment was greatest for those with a poorer tolerance for low O 2. Both the inter- and intra-individual variability in thresholds increased significantly at the highest altitude. 2. In a second series of tests control curves were obtained in normal air. Then while each subject remained dark adapted, the concentrations of oxygen were gradually decreased. The regeneration of visual purple was apparently complete during the 40 minutes of dark adaptation, yet in each case the thresholds continued to rise in direct proportion to the degree of anoxia. The inhalation of oxygen from a cylinder quickly counteracted the effects for the thresholds returned to the original control level within 2 to 3 minutes. 3. In experiments where the blood sugar was raised by the ingestion of glucose in normal air, no significant changes in the thresholds were observed except when the blood sugar was rapidly falling {{toward the end of the}} glucose tolerance tests. However, when glucose was ingested at the end of an experiment in low oxygen, while the subject remained dark adapted, the effects of the anoxia were largely counteracted within 6 to 8 minutes. 4. The influence of low blood sugar on light sensitivity was then studied by injecting insulin. The thresholds were raised as soon as the effects of the insulin produced a fall in the blood sugar. When the subjects inhaled oxygen the thresholds were lowered. Then when the oxygen was withdrawn so that the subject was breathing normal air, the thresholds rose again within 1 to 2 minutes. Finally, if the blood sugar was raised by ingesting glucose, the average threshold fell to the original control level or even below it. 5. The combined effects of low oxygen and low blood sugar on light sensitivity were studied in one subject (W. F.). These effects appeared to be greater than when a similar degree of anoxia or hypoglycemia was brought about separately. 6. In a series of experiments on ten subjects the dark <b>adaptation</b> <b>curves</b> were obtained both in the basal state and after a normal breakfast. In nine of the ten subjects, the food increased the sensitivity of the subjects to light. 7. The experiments reported above lend support to the hypothesis that both anoxia and hypoglycemia produce their effects on light sensitivity in essentially the same way; namely, by slowing the oxidative processes. Consequently the effects of anoxia may be ameliorated by giving glucose and the effects of hypoglycemia by inhaling oxygen. In our opinion, the changes may be attributed directly to the effects on the nervous tissue of the visual mechanism and the brain rather than on the photochemical processes of the retina...|$|R
40|$|The {{cerebellar}} {{contribution to}} motor entrainment through rhythmic auditory stimuli was analyzed by comparing rhythmic motor responses {{in subjects with}} cerebellar pathologies and in healthy controls. Eleven patients with cerebellar lesions and eight healthy subjects tapped in synchrony with an auditory rhythmic stimulus using a hand-held pencil-shaped electrode connected to a PC. A 60 -stimulus sequence was delivered with an ISI of 500 ms and changed at random to a new ISI value with either consciously perceived (+/- 50 ms) or unperceived tempo changes (+/- 10 ms). Synchronization patterns for both groups were computed based on the timing of interresponse intervals (IRls) and synchronization errors (SE). Variability of IRI {{as well as the}} timing of adaptation patterns after the tempo changes were modeled and analyzed mathematically using a logistic/sigmoid function. Healthy subjects performed with significantly lower IRI variability than cerebellar patients. Patients with focal lesions performed with significantly lower IRI variability than patients with atrophic lesions. Asymptote parameters during isochronous synchronization as well as slope angles and symmetry points of the <b>adaptation</b> <b>curves</b> after tempo perturbation showed no significant differences between groups. Present data indicate that temporal variability of rhythmic motor responses is differentially affected by distinct cerebellar pathologies but that motor entrainment to auditory rhythms is not affected by lesion of the cerebellar circuits.

Measurements of the photomechanical changes were made on sections of eyes which had been dark-adapted for varying periods of time. In some experiments the sensitivity changes during dark adaptation were first determined before the eye {{was placed in the}} fixation solution. No change in the position of the retinal pigment occurred in Cerapteryx graminis until the eye had been dark-adapted for about 5 minutes. The start of the migration was accompanied by the appearance of a break in the dark <b>adaptation</b> <b>curve.</b> During longer periods of dark adaptation the outward movement of the pigment proceeded in parallel with the change in sensitivity, the migration as well as the adaptive process being completed within about 30 minutes. In the diurnal insects chosen for the present study (Erebia, Argynnis) the positional changes of the retinal pigment were insignificant in comparison with the movement of the distal pigment in Cerapteryx graminis. On the basis of these observations the tentative hypothesis is put forward that the second phase of adaptive change in nocturnal Lepidoptera is mediated by the migration of the retinal pigment while the first phase is assumed to be produced by the resynthesis of some photochemical substance. In diurnal insects which have no appreciable pigment migration the biochemical events alone appear to be responsible for the increase in sensitivity during dark adaptation...|$|E

We furthermore investigated their dark adapted visual functions by the Goldmann Weekers dark <b>adaptation</b> <b>curve,</b> a dark adapted static visual field, and a two-dimensional version of the "Light Lab". In the latter test, a digital image of a living room with objects was projected on a screen. While increasing the luminance of the image, we asked the patients to report on detection and recognition of objects. The questionnaire showed that the CSNB 2 patients hardly experienced any night vision problems, while all CSNB 1 patients experienced some problems although they generally did not describe them as severe. The three scotopic tests showed minimally to moderately decreased dark adapted visual functions in the CSNB 2 patients, with differences between patients. In contrast, the dark adapted visual functions of the CSNB 1 patients were more severely affected, but showed almost no differences between patients. The results from the " 2 D Light Lab" showed that all CSNB 1 patients were blind at low intensities (equal to starlight), but quickly regained vision at higher intensities (full moonlight). Just above their dark adapted thresholds both CSNB 1 and CSNB 2 patients had normal visual fields. From the results we conclude that night vision problems in CSNB, in contrast to what the name suggests, are not conspicuous and generally not disabling. © 2013 Bijveld et al...|$|E

40|$|Mild closed {{head injury}} (CHI) can cause diffuse axonal {{dysfunction}} within the brain, and, amongst other things, cause deficits {{in several areas}} of oculomotor function. This study aimed to determine whether such deficits extended to saccadic adaptation, a form of subconscious (implicit) motor learning, within two weeks of mild CHI. Saccadic adaptation is the unconscious adjustment of saccade amplitude to surreptitious target displacements. Thirty patients (15 - 40 yr, Glasgow Coma Scale 13 - 15, alteration of consciousness < 20 min, post-traumatic amnesia < 4 h, and no oculomotor deficits on clinical examination) and 30 matched controls were compared using the following paradigm: Seven consecutive test blocks - a reflexive baseline block (no intrasaccadic target displacements), followed by five adaptation blocks, and a final baseline block. Each block comprised 50 horizontal jumps of a computer-generated stimulus. In the adaptation blocks, the target was always displaced centripetally by 12. 5 % of the initial target amplitude, triggered to occur during the saccades. Subjects were unaware of target displacements because of suppression of vision during saccades, but, over time, their primary saccades adapted subconsciously {{to land on the}} displaced target. Both groups adapted equally towards the ideal of 12. 5 % (CHI 8. 43 % vs control 9. 14 %, p = 0. 44). Similarly, {{there was no difference in}} absolute saccadic gain over any of the 7 blocks between the two groups. Exponential regression analysis of the <b>adaptation</b> <b>curves</b> confirmed that both the CHI and control subjects adapted with similar learning curves.

40|$|Astronauts {{experience}} sensorimotor {{changes during}} adaption to G-transitions that occur when entering and exiting microgravity. Post space flight, these sensorimotor disturbances can include postural and gait instability, visual performance changes, manual control disruptions, spatial disorientation, and motion sickness, {{all of which}} can hinder the operational capabilities of the astronauts. Crewmember safety would be significantly increased if sensorimotor changes brought on by gravitational changes could be mitigated and adaptation could be facilitated. The goal of this research is to investigate and develop the use of electrical stochastic vestibular stimulation (SVS) as a countermeasure to augment sensorimotor function and facilitate adaptation. For this project, SVS will be applied via electrodes on the mastoid processes at imperceptible amplitude levels. We hypothesize that SVS will improve sensorimotor performance through the phenomena of stochastic resonance, which occurs when the response of a nonlinear system to a weak input signal is optimized by the application of a particular nonzero level of noise. In line with the theory of stochastic resonance, a specific optimal level of SVS will be found and tested for each subject [1]. Three experiments are planned to investigate the use of SVS in sensory-dependent tasks and performance. The first experiment will aim to demonstrate stochastic resonance in the vestibular system through perception based motion recognition thresholds obtained using a 6 -degree of freedom Stewart platform in the Jenks Vestibular Laboratory at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. A range of SVS amplitudes will be applied to each subject and the subjectspecific optimal SVS level will be identified as that which results in the lowest motion recognition threshold, through previously established, well developed methods [2, 3, 4]. The second experiment will investigate the use of optimal SVS in facilitating sensorimotor adaptation to system disturbances. Subjects will adapt to wearing minifying glasses, resulting in decreased vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) gain. The VOR gain will then be intermittently measured while the subject readapts to normal vision, with and without optimal SVS. We expect that optimal SVS will cause a steepening of the <b>adaptation</b> <b>curve.</b> The third experiment will test the use of optimal SVS in an operationally relevant aerospace task, using the tilt translation sled at NASA Johnson Space Center, a test platform capable of recreating the tilt-gain and tilt-translation illusions associated with landing of a spacecraft post-space flight. In this experiment, a perception based manual control measure will be used to compare performance with and without optimal SVS. We expect performance to improve in this task when optimal SVS is applied. The ultimate goal of this work is to systematically investigate and further understand the potential benefits of stochastic vestibular stimulation in the context of human space flight so that it may be used in the future as a component of a comprehensive countermeasure plan for adaptation to G-transitions...|$|E

Therefore, the acceptability of several ITS applications with high estimated safety potential to different sub-groups of drivers was {{the main focus of}} this paper. The study was carried out in two key phases. The first phase encompassed preliminary activities required to be undertaken with the aim of identifying a small number of promising in-vehicle ITS devices that would be assessed for their acceptability. To this end, fist it was necessary to identify drivers’ needs in actual accident context. This was achieved by case-by-case analysis of the potential sources of accidents elicited by interviewing traffic experts based on their in-depth analysis of crash data. Promising ITS functions were conditioned based on their capability to satisfy drivers’ needs. This analysis resulted in the selection of 12 systems for inclusion in the study; Alcohol Detection and Interlocks, Drowsy Driver Warning, Adaptive Front lighting, Night Vision, Intelligent Speed <b>Adaptation,</b> <b>Curve</b> Speed Warning, Adaptive Cruise Control, Forward Collision Mitigation, Intersection Assistant, Lane Change Support, Vehicle Monitoring System, and Electronic License Key. These systems, among several ITS technologies, were assessed to confer the greatest safety benefit to the road user community. In the second phase, the focus was to understand the effect of independent variables pertaining to drivers’ background characteristics on their perceived acceptability of various in-vehicle ITS products. This was achieved by executing questionnaire involving a total of 150 car drivers from Iran and Sweden varying in age, gender, and driving characteristics. The results show that on average, the acceptability of ITS applications is rather high. There is evidence to suggest that drivers in diverse groups have different requirements and expectations that have to be met, if ITS technologies are to be acceptable to them. Forward Collision Mitigation system has the highest perceived level of acceptability especially among older drivers. Perceived acceptability of Alcohol Interlocks and Electronic License Key was remarkably low, while these systems are predicted to yield the highest reduction in road trauma and costs. The indications of these findings for the success of ITS have been discussed. A further focus in the second phase was on identification of the significant impediments which would prevent ITS technologies to be accepted by the drivers from their own perspective. Recommendations for enhancing ITS acceptance have been made. The report concludes with suggestions for future work...|$|E
40|$|Bees {{which are}} held in a fixed {{position}} so that only head movements can be made, respond to a moving stripe system in their visual field by a characteristic motion of the antennae. This reflex {{can be used to}} measure the bee's state of photic <b>adaptation.</b> A <b>curve</b> describing the course of dark adaptation is obtained, which shows that the sensitivity of the light adapted bee's eye increases rapidly during the first few minutes in darkness, then more slowly until it reaches a maximum level after 25 to 30 minutes. The total increase in sensitivity is about 1000 fold. The adaptive range of the human eye is about 10 times greater than for the bee's eye. The range covered by the bee's eye corresponds closely to the adapting range which is covered by the rods of the human eye...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{responses}} of taste cells on {{the legs of the}} blood-feeding tsetse fly Glossina fuscipes fuscipes Newstead 1910 (Diptera: Glossinidae) to twenty protein amino acids and to their mixture as it is present in human;sweat. It is investigated whether the mixture is sensed differently than the amino acids singly. The taste cells are most sensitive to phenylalanine (K approximate to 1 mu M) and tyrosine; and they respond in a lesser degree to methionine, valine, isoleucine, cysteine, tryptophan, histidine, alanine, and threonine. The amino acids serine, proline, asparagine, arginine, glutamine, lysine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and glycine give little or no response even at 10 mM. As the succession of effectiveness of the amino acids appears to be the same for all cells, it is deduced that the flies are unable to discriminate the amino acids by comparing responses across sensory cells. A temporal coding of quality does not seem feasible either. Thus, the properties of the taste cells limit the sense to assessing the intensity of an amino acid stimulus and not its identity. Although several parameters in the response <b>adaptation</b> <b>curves</b> are concentration-dependent, it is suggested that the flies judge intensity of a stimulus only from the first 50 or so milliseconds. Although other studies and these indicate that a multiplicity of binding sites may be responsible for the reception of amino acids, the response to the mixture can be predicted from a no-interaction model, whereby each ligand's access to the binding sites is proportional to its mole fraction. It is argued that this may be the case for more of the naturally occurring mixtures which comprise structurally similar ligands. The responses to the mixture and to phenylalanine alone are equally susceptible to inhibition by sodium chloride. It is suggested that, although discrimination of hosts probably requires another sense, the sense of taste is an excellent tool to detect a host underfoot during the local search for a feeding site...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} an adaptive approach to B-spline curve physical simulation. We combine geometric refinement and coarsening techniques with an appropriate continuous mechanical model. We thus {{deal with the}} (temporal and geometric) continuity issues implied when mechanical adaptive resolution is used. To achieve real-time local <b>adaptation</b> of spline <b>curves,</b> some criteria and optimizations are shown. Among application examples, real-time knot tying is presented, and curve cutting is also pointed out as a nice sideeffect of the adaptive resolution animation framework.

40|$|Corrosion-fatigue is a {{dangerous}} failure mechanism that is not yet fully understood. Structures subjected to corrosion-fatigue are over conservative in design, which is economically unfavourable. To counter this, representative laboratory experiments simulating the corrosion-fatigue conditions of an offshore structure should be performed. Lab testing is, for obvious reasons, performed at frequencies much higher than these of wave and wind actions. However, this means that corrosion needs to be accelerated in the same manner. In this work two different ways to accelerate corrosion were selected, namely temperature and oxygen content <b>adaptation.</b> S-N <b>curves</b> were determined in different test conditions in order to evaluate the damage evolution. It {{has been found that}} high temperatures and high levels of oxygen content will result in earlier failure. The fracture surfaces are somewhat different than fracture surfaces obtained due to fatigue in air. More crack initiation sites can be observed and the fracture surface is generally rougher due to corrosion...|$|R
