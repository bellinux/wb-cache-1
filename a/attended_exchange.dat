The review suggested that there was an urgent need to increase efforts {{to prevent the spread of}} these infections. Further, a Scottish report, ‘Preventing HCV in Scotland: Options for Action’ recommends that research to explore how needle exchanges vary in their clientele, and how different groups of drug users access these schemes, should be conducted.

It also briefly presents the main models and methods used in the specialized literature for the evaluation of the equilibrum exchange rate. The utilization of as many methods allows the deciders of monetary and economic policy to accurately ground the moment of one country adhesion to the euro zone. Also, an analysis can be made, whether the respective countru is ready and how fast the process of convergence to the Euro zone can evolve. In general, it is recommendable a country not to force de adhesion to the euro zone because the negative effects may occur {{for a long period of}} time, leading to a development for the respective economy under its potential. The estimated model in Romania based on data will be afterwards used for estimating the equilibrum rate and for issuing scenarios concerning its future evolution. Usually, the parity at which the national currency should be converted for an unlimited period of time, will also be around the level of the equilibrum rate. From that moment on, after <b>attending</b> the <b>Exchange</b> Rate Mechanism II (ERM II), the respective country’s economy loses an equilibrum buffer – the exchange rate.

40|$|Advances {{in mobile}} robot {{technology}} allow an increasing variety of applications to be imagined, including: search and rescue, exploration of unknown areas {{and working with}} hazardous materials. State of the art robots are able to behave autonomously and without direct human control, using on-board devices to perceive, navigate and reason about the world. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are particularly well suited to performing advanced sensing tasks by moving rapidly through the environment irrespective of the terrain. Deploying groups of mobile robots offers advantages, such as robustness to individual failures {{and a reduction in}} task completion time. However, to operate efficiently these teams require specific approaches to enable the individual agents to cooperate. This thesis proposes coordinated approaches to search scenarios for teams of UAVs. The primary application considered is Wilderness Search and Rescue (WiSaR), although the techniques developed are applicable elsewhere. A novel frontier-based search approach is developed for rotor-craft UAVs, taking advantage of available terrain information to minimise altitude changes during flight. This is accompanied by a lightweight coordination mechanism to enable cooperative behaviour with minimal additional overhead. The concept of a team rendezvous is introduced, at which all team members <b>attend</b> to <b>exchange</b> data. This also provides an ideal opportunity to create a comprehensive team solution to relay newly gathered data to a base station. Furthermore, the delay between sensing and the acquired data becoming available to mission commanders is analysed and a technique proposed for adapting the team to meet a latency requirement. These approaches are evaluated and characterised experimentally through simulation. Coordinated frontier search is shown to outperform greedy walk methods, reducing redundant sensing coverage using only a minimal coordination protocol. Combining the search, rendezvous and relay techniques provides a holistic approach to the deployment of UAV teams, meeting mission objectives without extensive pre-configuration.

One dynamic model version speci cally aims at examining the issue of addiction. Lastly, we examine, by means of pseudo panel data models, the possible influence of various kinds of unobserved heterogeneity on estimated price and income responses.

The sample was primarily heroin injecting, about two thirds male, half White and half other racial/ethnic groups.

Interviews lasted about 30 minutes. SSE was highly prevalent: 75 % of IDUs reported participating in SSE in the 6 months before interview. Program characteristics, such as legal status, SSE policy, and exchange policy, did not affect the prevalence of SSE among SEP clients. Infectious disease risk behaviors were significantly more common among SSE participants than nonparticipants. SSE participants were more likely to share syringes (p <. 001) and cookers (p <. 001) in the previous 6 months.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Meaningful {{reductions}} in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) transmission rates among persons who inject drugs (PWID) require a comprehensive prevention approach, including access to harm reduction measures and to healthcare-related interventions, such as HCV screening, testing and antiviral treatment. Little is known, however, {{about the role}} of visiting a primary care physician (PCP) in relation to HCV infection risk among PWID, when integrated within a combined prevention approach. This study assessed the association between PCP visiting and HCV seroconversion among PWID <b>attending</b> needle <b>exchange</b> programs (NEP). METHODS: A prospective cohort study, HEPCO, was conducted among active PWID in Montréal (2004 - 2013). Interviews scheduled at 3 - or 6 -month intervals included completion of an interviewer-administered questionnaire, and collection of blood samples for HCV antibody testing. HCV-seronegative participants who reported NEP attendance at baseline and had at least one follow-up visit were eligible for this study. HCV incidence was calculated using the person-time method. Time-varying Cox regression modeling was conducted to evaluate the relationship between self-reported recent PCP visiting and HCV incidence. RESULTS: At baseline assessment, of 226 participants (80. 5 % male; median age: 30. 6 years), 37. 2 % reported having recently visited a PCP. During 449. 6 person-years of follow-up, 79 participants seroconverted to HCV [incidence rate: 17. 6 per 100 person-years, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 14. 0 - 21. 8]. Covariate-adjusted analyses indicated that visiting a PCP was associated with a lower risk of HCV infection [Adjusted Hazard Ratio: 0. 54, 95 % CI: 0. 31 - 0. 93]. Other independent predictors of HCV infection included unstable housing, cocaine injection and prescription opioid injection. CONCLUSION: Among PWID attending NEP, visiting a PCP was associated with a lower risk of HCV infection. Yet, only a minority of participants reported PCP visiting. Efforts to intensify engagement with PCP among PWID could potentially contribute to lower HCV transmission when integrated within a combined approach to prevention...|$|R
40|$|Background: Second {{generation}} surveillance is {{a central}} feature of HIV/AIDS policy in Switzerland. Behavioural surveys in the general population, men having sex with men (MSM) and injecting drug users (IDU) have been regularly conducted since the early nineties. After peaking at 2144 cases in 1991, {{the number of new}} HIV cases notified to the Ministry of Health decreased in each subpopulation until 2000 (n= 578) and then rose again to 735 in 2006. The recent increase is mainly due to MSM. Methods: In the general population, representative cross-sectional telephone surveys have been conducted 11 times since 1987. Surveys in convenience samples of MSM, recruited through gay newspapers and gay organisations, have been conducted 5 times since 1992. Surveys among IDU's <b>attending</b> needle <b>exchange</b> programmes have been conducted 5 times since 1993. Condom statistics, available since 1986, are included in the behavioural surveillance system. Results: In the general population aged 17 - 30, systematic condom use with casual partners {{in the last six months}} increased from 8. 0 % in 1987 to 75. 8 % in 2007. The proportion of MSM reporting anal intercourse with casual partners in the last 12 months increased from 61 % in 1992 to 79 % in 2007 (lowest value 56 % in 1994) and unprotected anal intercourse with these partners increased from 14 % in 1992 to 24 % in 2007 (lowest value 9 % in 1994). The proportion of IDUs reporting borrowing used injection equipment decreased from 16. 5 % in 1993 to 8. 9 % in 2006. The ratio condoms released to retail/population aged 15 - 65 increased from 1. 68 in 1986 to 3. 8 in 2006.
