5|$|An inflationary phase, an {{additional}} phase of strongly accelerated expansion at cosmic times of around 10−33 seconds, was hypothesized in 1980 {{to account for}} several puzzling observations that were unexplained by classical cosmological models, such as the nearly perfect homogeneity of the cosmic background radiation. Recent measurements of the cosmic background radiation {{have resulted in the}} first evidence for this scenario. However, there is <b>a</b> <b>bewildering</b> variety of possible inflationary scenarios, which cannot be restricted by current observations. An even larger question is the physics of the earliest universe, prior to the inflationary phase and close to where the classical models predict the big bang singularity. An authoritative answer would require a complete theory of quantum gravity, which has not yet been developed (cf. the section on quantum gravity, below).|$|E

25|$|Typically, the {{legislature}} is in session for 60 days between January and early April. The {{final day of}} the regular session ends in <b>a</b> <b>bewildering</b> fury of last-minute legislation to meet a constitutionally imposed midnight deadline.

25|$|Before his disappearance, the Foreign Ministry had {{scheduled}} {{for him to}} serve as Malaysian Ambassador to Italy. However, after the incident, the Foreign Ministry arranged for him to work as Deputy Secretary (Special Duties) to the Ministry instead. Lim resigned from the Foreign Ministry in August 1968, {{putting an end to}} his political career in Malaysia. Shortly after, the Government abruptly revoked his title as Tun in late November of the same year, making his disappearance in Australia <b>a</b> <b>bewildering</b> mystery. According to his autobiography published after his death, he chose to go missing because he had a broken relationship with his wife and he was emotionally overwhelmed.|$|E

25|$|Only Pegg and Swarbrick {{remained}} and {{the following}} few years have been dubbed 'Fairport confusion' as <b>a</b> <b>bewildering</b> sequence of band members came and went, but by 1973 Mattacks had returned and two former members of Sandy Denny's Fotheringay had joined the band, Denny's Australian husband Trevor Lucas on vocals and guitar and American Jerry Donahue on lead guitar. From these line-ups the band produced two studio albums: Rosie, notable for the Swarbrick penned title track (1973) and Nine (1974), the ninth studio album by the band. The last of these contained writing contributions by Lucas to five of the nine tracks, which together with Donahue's country influences and outstanding guitar pyrotechnics gave the album a very distinctive feel.|$|E

Two in particular had lasting effects. Stan Davis was a brilliant on-field tactician and crafty leg spin bowler, and Bruce Kline a freakishly talented wicketkeeper, who while keeping up to the stumps to most bowlers, took <b>a</b> <b>bewildering</b> 31 stumpings and just 6 catches in one season. 13yo Brett Kline was part of the under 14s premiers in 1977/78, who would go on to become the senior games record holder in 2011, while Gerald Walshe played his first senior game in October 1978. 30 seasons later Walshe would claim a record 644 senior wickets.|$|E

25|$|When it {{originally}} began the anti-Spanish rebellion, Polisario {{was forced to}} capture its weapons individually, and transport them only by foot or camel. But the insurgents multiplied their arsenal and military sophistication after striking an alliance with Algeria in 1975. The modern SPLA is equipped mainly with outdated Soviet-manufactured weaponry, donated by Algeria. But its arsenals display <b>a</b> <b>bewildering</b> variety of material, much of it captured from Spanish, Mauritanian (Panhard AMLs) or Moroccan forces (Eland Mk7s, Ratel IFVs, AMX-13s, SK-105 Kürassiers) and made in France, the United States, South Africa, Austria or Britain. The SPLA has several armored units, composed of old tanks (T-55s, T-62s), somewhat more modern armored cars (EE-9 Cascavels, BRDM-2s), infantry fighting vehicles (BMP-1s, BTR-60s), rocket launchers (BM-21s) and halftracks. Surface-to-air missiles (anti-aircraft missiles, as SA-6s, SA-7s, SA-8s and SA-9s) have downed several Moroccan F-5 fighter jets, and helped compensate for the complete Moroccan control of the skies.|$|E

It's cool because of that." [...] Aaron Foley of MLive considered it Jackson's fourth most underrated single, calling it among [...] "the fruits from that era that don't get the respect they deserve". Foley added, that after Jackson's Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, [...] "I Want You" [...] "got lost in the wash. The starry-eyed, Motown-inspired ballad had Janet vulnerable and lovesick, boo hooing for her lover's attention." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1921 season, Waddington took 105 wickets at {{an average}} of 18.94. The {{introduction}} of the pace bowler George Macaulay into the team gave him more support, but according to a later edition of Wisden, Waddington's form was poor that year. The almanack's review of the 1921 season suggested that, when at full strength, Yorkshire had the best bowling attack in the championship, but the team finished third. Both Waddington and Yorkshire were more successful the following year: the county won the first of four successive championships, and Waddington took 133 wickets {{at an average}} of 16.08. He was often effective in the most important matches. Wisden suggested that [...] "Yorkshire were very good at every point, but their main strength lay in the excellence and variety of their bowling... was, on occasions, more successful against strong sides than he had ever been before. He had days of astonishing success and once, at least, bowled with <b>a</b> <b>bewildering</b> swerve [...] that recalled George Hirst at his best." [...] Among his best performances were figures of eight for 34 against Northamptonshire (the best of his career), seven wickets for six runs in a Sussex total of 20 and eight for 35 against Hampshire. His season ended with festival games at Eastbourne, where he represented the North against the South and played for a team of ex-Royal Air Force servicemen.|$|E
