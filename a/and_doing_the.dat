25|$|A {{defining}} {{incident of}} young Wells's life {{was an accident}} in 1874 that left him bedridden with a broken leg. To pass the time he started reading books from the local library, brought {{to him by his}} father. He soon became devoted to the other worlds and lives to which books gave him access; they also stimulated his desire to write. Later that year he entered Thomas Morley's Commercial Academy, a private school founded in 1849 following the bankruptcy of Morley's earlier school. The teaching was erratic, the curriculum mostly focused, Wells later said, on producing copperplate handwriting <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> sort of sums useful to tradesmen. Wells continued at Morley's Academy until 1880. In 1877, his father, Joseph Wells, fractured his thigh. The accident effectively put an end to Joseph's career as a cricketer, and his subsequent earnings as a shopkeeper were not enough to compensate for the loss of the primary source of family income.|$|E
25|$|Liberal Party members {{gathered}} in Winnipeg on September 2, for a three-day caucus which changed from {{preparing for a}} new parliamentary session to a strategy session to formulate a plan to attack the Conservatives while healing internal party rifts that have surfaced in recent weeks. Conservatives began spending at least $60 million on pre-election funding projects {{to a wide variety}} of institutions and groups. A few announcements have been big, including Industry Minister Jim Prentice's pledge of $25 million for the expansion of the Northlands exhibition facility in Edmonton. But the Tories have also announced a number of smaller projects, including $40,000 for the 2008 55+ Games and $25,000 for the Peace Window of the Holy Trinity Anglican Church in Winnipeg. The announcements have also been spread out across the country. The Atlantic region is to get more than $500,000 for youth jobs and eight cultural organizations. The Association of Book Publishers of British Columbia will receive $81,000. Jack Layton attacked the Conservative Party as bribing the public <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> same thing they used to complain about the Liberals doing before elections.|$|E

Murrow, which was broadcast on March 9, 1954. Titled [...] "A Report on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy", the episode consisted largely of clips of McCarthy speaking. In these clips, McCarthy accuses the Democratic party of [...] "twenty years of treason", describes the American Civil Liberties Union as [...] "listed as 'a front for, <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> work of', the Communist Party", and berates and harangues various witnesses, including General Zwicker.|$|E

Natasha and Andrew eventually get back together and Adelaide Now said that thrills Natasha [...] "as she's completely obsessed" [...] with Andrew.|$|E
500|$|Lovato had no {{interest}} in forging a relationship with her late father, Patrick, after his divorce from her mother.

[...] Richard Roeper awarded the film four out of four stars, saying, [...] "When Ferreira finally appears and we learn the truth about where he's been all this time, it further serves Scorsese's central theme about the conflict between adhering to one's sacred vows and traditional beliefs <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> right thing, the prudent thing, the moral thing, on a very pragmatic level." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} shot in two days in Gallatin and Hendersonville, Tennessee.

[...] On the second day, they first filmed a prom scene and, lastly, the football game, both being filmed at Pope John Paul II High School. The school supplied many students as extras, including football players, band members, cheerleaders and students. The final prom scene used the school's decorations for its real prom the next night. When filming for a touchdown, Till was unable to catch the ball, furthering the length of the shoot.

Jeff Rothschild was responsible for Lohan's vocal recording, which occurred at the Henson Recording Studios in Hollywood, California. He also handled the song's mixing, programming and engineering. Other engineers involved were Dave Audé and Mark Valentine. [...] "Over" [...] is written in the time signature of common time with a moderate tempo of 90 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of C minor with Lohan's voice spanning from C4 to C5. According to Spence D. of IGN, [...] "Over" [...] begins like a song by The Cure, complete with a [...] "mournful acoustic guitar" [...] and a [...] "haunting piano-tuned synth". He wrote that since the song was not penned by Robert Smith, [...] "it quickly turns into a slow rocker in which Lohan returns to her 'can't live without you' love torn subject matter". In an interview with The Ellen DeGeneres Show on March 28, 2014, Lohan told DeGeneres the song was about her break-up with Wilmer Valderrama.|$|E

Native Americans in Phoenix, Arizona picketed at the game between the Chiefs and the Arizona Cardinals, and have asked the Cardinals' management to bar [...] "Redface", the wearing of headdresses and face paint, protesting what they perceive to be a mockery of Native American culture.

500|$|Dangerously in Love {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 64, based on 16 reviews. Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone viewed that it presents Beyoncé in two styles, one [...] "far more flattering" [...] than the other, {{and found the}} ballad-oriented songs on the album least flattering, commenting that Beyoncé has [...] "plenty of time" [...] to develop the style maturely that would [...] " [...] sense for her". Entertainment Weeklys Neil Drumming commented that the album validates Beyoncé's [...] "taste in innovation". He also viewed that Beyoncé's collaboration with various record producers explores new directions in contemporary music, doing more reinventing than revisiting. Like DeCurtis' review, however, Drumming pointed out that [...] "most of the disc's missteps" [...] are in its latter part. Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani wrote that [...] " [...] is allowed more room to experiment vocally as a solo artist, exploring softer registers and lathering on the coquettish persona that was only hinted at on Destiny's Child tracks like 'Bootylicious.'". Steve Jones of USA Today stated, [...] "Beyoncé succeeds by showing greater depth as a songwriter and broader range as a singer". Blenders Ben Ratliff complimented Beyoncé's performance and stated, [...] "She's playing the cool-hunter but covering the bases with seraphic arrangements of multiple voices. Her reach is remarkable". Mark Anthony Neal of PopMatters called it an [...] "artistic leap" [...] and wrote that it [...] "finds Ms. B {{in the midst of}} a fully flowering womanhood <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> best singing of her career".|$|E
500|$|Mark Robson was {{assigned}} to direct in June 1943. Robson was the RKO director [...] "most in tune with [...] idea of psychological terror". Robson had just finished editing Orson Welles' Journey Into Fear, and there are distinct stylistic similarities between the two films. Robson and Lewton chose to use single-source lighting throughout the film {{in order to make}} the sets and performances more interesting, and sets were designed to utilize this type of lighting. The two men also agreed to continue Lewton's emphasis on unseen and implied terror. Cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca, art directors Albert S. D'Agostino and Walter E. Keller, and composer Roy Webb all regularly worked with Lewton, and did so on The Ghost Ship as well. Richard Dix was cast because he was already on contract with RKO to do several [...] "quickie" [...] pictures at a set fee per film, <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>The</b> Ghost Ship would help fulfill his contract without much effort. Russell Wade had provided a disembodied voice in The Leopard Man, and this was his first starring role in a Lewton production. His performance here led him to be cast in Lewton's later The Body Snatcher (1945). Edith Barrett, Ben Bard, Dewey Robinson, and Charles Lung all had worked with Lewton before. Skelton Knaggs, Edmund Glover, and future film noir star Lawrence Tierney, whom Lewton had seen modeling clothing in a Sears, Roebuck catalog, all made their motion picture debuts in the movie. Sir Lancelot, a well-known calypso singer, who later influenced the career of Harry Belafonte), had already appeared in singing roles in three prior films (including I Walked with a Zombie). Atmosphere is created in the film by the contrast between murder and the joviality of the calypso songs sung on board.|$|E
