None of the cities where we play our championship is named New York, Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago or Miami. We don't play on a campus. We play in professional football arenas.|$|E

Perry Nemiroff of Cinema Blend speculated that Tron 3 could be the first installment in a new trilogy. On January 13, 2011, Ain't It Cool News reported that the film was close to having its sequel announced as part of Disney's plan for Tron future. On January 21, 2011, Tron-Sector reported an unsourced rumor that a sequel to Tron: Legacy had been green-lit and a teaser trailer would debut on the DVD and Blu-ray Disc releases of Tron and Tron: Legacy. Harry Knowles reported on the teaser, calling it a [...] "DVD Extra" [...] and noting that it had been filmed before Thanksgiving (i.e. before November 2010). On April 8, 2011, director Joseph Kosinski talked about the sequel: [...] "We're working on the story right now. Once we get a script we're all really happy with, we'll take it to the powers that be <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can go back to the grid. I think we will pick up with where Tron: Legacy left off with Sam and Quorra in the real world and what does that mean and the possibilities it opens up for the next chapter. It's that relationship between the two of them that's the next step." [...] On March 31, Kosinski said that the film's script was expected to be finished in two weeks and its working title is Tr3n.|$|E
500|$|On July 30, 2010, the NBC network {{announced}} that {{an episode of}} 30 Rocks fifth season would be filmed and broadcast live on two occasions in the evening of October 14, 2010. The decision was made {{in part due to}} lagging ratings for all of NBC's Must-See TV line-up. The idea was originally conceived during the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, when the cast performed two live versions of the season two episode [...] "Secrets and Lies" [...] as a benefit at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York City. When asked by Entertainment Weekly the reason for doing a live episode, Fey said [...] " [...] was what made us {{think that it would be}} fun to do [...] And how far we've come... Now we're going to do it on TV." [...] In this same interview, Fey revealed that the episode would also be performed in front of a live audience. [...] "It will be exciting for us to do it for a live audience <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> get live laughter." [...] Fey noted that the experience [...] "was so fun to feel the different timing of the show live and the audience response, which you just don't get in a single-camera show." [...] In another interview, Fey revealed that the staff have talked about doing a live show for years [...] "because we felt we had sort of interesting personnel for it." [...] Following the conclusion of the writers' strike they spoke to NBC about performing live and attempted to film it during the fourth season; however, they were unable to schedule it. For the fifth season, the writing staff began planning the live performance and waited until McCarthy-Miller—a recurring 30 Rock director—was available to helm it. Fey and Carlock said in separate discussions that another decision to do this episode of 30 Rock was based on the cast having theater and improvisation experience. Alec Baldwin had previously performed in the East and West live broadcasts of the Will & Grace [...] premiere episode, [...] "Alive and Schticking".|$|E

2500|$|Discontent with Diệm and Nhu {{exploded}} into mass protest during mid-1963 when nine Buddhists {{died at the}} hand of Diệm's army and police on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha. In response, the US government {{was concerned about the}} possibility [...] "for the Dim/Nhu government to succeed and for us [...] to continue to support them." [...] The response by Ambassador Nolting was, [...] "We should take it slow and easy <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can live with the Diem government." [...] As a result of this potential inability to support the Diem/Nhu government, the United States government discussed a proposed coup. In a telegram to the American Embassy in Saigon, Mr. Hilsman expresses that at some point should we need [...] "political liquidation" [...] we should also [...] "urgently examine all possible alternative leadership and make detailed plans as to how we might bring about Diem's replacement if this should become necessary." [...] In May 1963, a law against the flying of religious flags was selectively enforced; the Buddhist flag was banned from display on Vesak while the Vatican flag was displayed to celebrate the anniversary of the consecration of Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục, Diệm's brother. Many Buddhists defied the ban and a protest was ended when government forces opened fire. With Diệm remaining intransigent in the face of escalating Buddhist demands for religious equality, sections of society began calling for his removal from power.|$|E
2500|$|In 1884, {{following}} his final term at Carlisle, Standing Bear, {{armed with a}} recommendation by Captain Pratt, returned home to the Rosebud Agency, Rosebud, South Dakota, where he was hired as an assistant at the reservation's school at the salary of three hundred dollars a year. In 1890, some time after Wounded Knee, Luther moved from Rosebud and followed his father and brother Ellis Standing Bear to Pine Ridge, South Dakota. [...] Pine Ridge provided a series of varying employment and family ventures. In 1891, Luther became principal of a reservation day school. Standing Bear also worked in his uncle’s little general store. [...] One day {{they were talking about}} the delay in mail delivery. [...] “I told my uncle that John Wanamaker, the man for whom I had worked in Philadelphia, was Postmaster-General, and that I would write <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> could not have a post office established at his camp. [...] I suggested that we call it Kyle. [...] It was a short name and easy to spell. [...] When Mr. Wanamaker received my letter, he replied immediately. [...] He was pleased with my suggestion, but said that he could not appoint me postmaster, as I was an Indian. [...] It would have to be some white man. [...] There was a Joseph Taylor who was one of our missionaries, and we sent his name. [...] He received the appointment, but I took care of the office.” [...] Later, Luther opened a dry goods store with his brother Ellis at Pass Creek and started a small ranch raising horses and cattle. Standing Bear organized public meetings at his dry goods store in Pine Ridge to discuss treaties and current events.|$|E

6000|$|... "So {{that the}} case appears to be merely one of {{malicious}} damage. But none the less, I should be very glad to go carefully round the premises, <b>and</b> to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can find any trace to show us who your visitor may have been." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I'm {{glad to have}} a {{recommend}} {{from that}} quarter. Airheart's skipper of the San José now.

6000|$|... "What {{the captain}} says {{has a great}} deal of truth in it," [...] he remarked, with a laugh. [...] "You don't realize a thing until you've had to {{experience}} it.

6000|$|... "Well, I am willing," [...] {{answered}} Snap. [...] "But I {{think we}} ought to visit Lake Cameron first <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can't find this Lusher Barrock." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I'll have {{to think}} this over," [...] said Anderson Rover, after an {{examination}} of the rocks. [...] "We'll have to try to locate the treasure <b>and</b> then <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can raise enough dynamite to blow the rocks away.

6000|$|... "Come," [...] said Mistress Madge, {{rising to}} her feet and taking his hand; [...] "lead us to your home, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> will <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> cannot assist your poor mother." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That's so, too! Well, come ahead, let's hurry <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> {{can catch}} sight of them." [...] And then the two boys pushed ahead faster than ever.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait and see!" [...] she chanted ironically. [...] "Wait <b>and</b> <b>see!</b> <b>If</b> <b>we</b> {{must leave}} the dear country--then adieu!" [...] And she gravely bowed to an {{imaginary}} England.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, he doesn't own the town, and if {{it comes}} to the worst, perhaps we can avoid him. Let us go out, anyway, <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can't." ...|$|E
