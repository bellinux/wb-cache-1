5|$|During {{this period}} greater {{emphasis}} was laid upon {{the civil service}} system of recruiting officials; this was based upon degrees acquired through competitive examinations, {{in an effort to}} select the most capable individuals for governance. Selecting men for office through proven merit was an ancient idea in China. The civil service system became institutionalized on a small scale during the Sui and Tang dynasties, but by the Song period it became virtually the only means for drafting officials into the government. The advent of widespread printing helped to widely circulate Confucian teachings and to educate more and more eligible candidates for the exams. This {{can be seen in the}} number of exam takers for the low-level prefectural exams rising from 30,000 annual candidates in the early 11th century to 400,000 candidates by the late 13th century. The civil service and examination system allowed for greater meritocracy, social mobility, and equality in competition for those wishing to attain an official seat in government. Using statistics gathered by the Song state, Edward A. Kracke, Sudō Yoshiyuki, and Ho Ping-ti supported the hypothesis that simply having a father, grandfather, or great-grandfather who had served as an official of state did not guarantee one would obtain the same level of authority. Robert Hartwell and Robert P. Hymes criticized this model, stating that it places too much emphasis on the role of the nuclear family and considers only three paternal <b>ascendants</b> of exam candidates while ignoring the demographic reality of Song China, the significant proportion of males in each generation that had no surviving sons, and the role of the extended family. Many felt disenfranchised by what they saw as a bureaucratic system that favored the land-holding class able to afford the best education. One of the greatest literary critics of this was the official and famous poet Su Shi. Yet Su was a product of his times, as the identity, habits, and attitudes of the scholar-official had become less aristocratic and more bureaucratic with the transition of the periods from Tang to Song. At the beginning of the dynasty, government posts were disproportionately held by two elite social groups: a founding elite who had ties with the founding emperor and a semi-hereditary professional elite who used long-held clan status, family connections, and marriage alliances to secure appointments. By the late 11th century, the founding elite became obsolete, while political partisanship and factionalism at court undermined the marriage strategies of the professional elite, which dissolved as a distinguishable social group and was replaced by a multitude of gentry families.|$|E
500|$|Alarak (voiced by John de Lancie) is {{a central}} figure of the Tal'Darim {{in the service of}} Amon. He was first {{described}} in the short story Ascension, one of the lead-up short stories before the release of Legacy of the Void. In the story, he holds the title of Fourth Ascendant, a minor leader in the Tal'Darim hierarchy, known as the [...] "Chain of Ascension"; one can only advance in rank through Rak'Shir, a ritual trial by combat of their immediate superior. When the First Ascendant, Nuroka, challenges Highlord Ma'lash for leadership of the Tal'Darim, Alarak remains neutral, until Ma'lash seemed on the brink of defeat; he then declared for him, offering his psionic strength, allowing Ma'lash to defeat Nuroka. With the First, Second, and Third <b>Ascendants</b> claimed in the battle, Alarak is named First Ascendant; however, Ma'lash is wary, and threatens a slow and painful death if Alarak betrays him.|$|E
500|$|Ebrey {{states that}} {{meritocracy}} {{and a greater}} sense of social mobility were also prevalent in the civil service examination system, as the government held a list of all examination graduates, showing that only roughly half of those who passed had a father, or grandfather, or great-grandfather who served as a government official. However, Robert Hartwell and Robert P. Hymes state that this fact, first presented by Edward A. Kracke in 1947 and supported by Sudō Yoshiyuki and Ho Ping-ti, emphasizes the role of the nuclear family and only demonstrates three paternal <b>ascendants</b> of the candidates while ignoring the demographic reality of Song China, the significant proportion of males in each generation that had no surviving sons, {{and the role of the}} extended family. Male children with fathers who were incumbents in office had the advantage of early education and experience, as they were often appointed by their father to low-level staff positions. Yet with the so-called 'protection' (yin or yin-bu 荫补/蔭補) privilege this arrangement was extended to close relatives, as an elder brother, uncle, father-in-law, and even father-in-law to one's uncle could help one secure a future in office. The Song era poet Su Shi (1037–1101) wrote a poem called On the Birth of My Son, poking fun at the situation of children from affluent and politically connected backgrounds having the upper edge over bright children of lower status: ...|$|E

Same-sex marriages are now performed statewide. Louisiana is a community property state.|$|E
2500|$|With Aukerman away at college, the Descendents added Ray Cooper as both {{singer and}} second guitarist.

It was all a disaster, it was sad, for me anyway." [...] Navetta ultimately quit the band by setting all of his musical equipment on fire and moving to Oregon, where he became a full-time fisherman.|$|E

60|$|Indeed, my dear Sir, {{there is}} not a single {{particular}} in the Francis-Street declamations, which has not, to your and to my certain knowledge, been taught by the jealous <b>ascendants,</b> sometimes by doctrine, sometimes by example, always by provocation. Remember the whole of 1781 and 1782, in Parliament and out of Parliament; at this very day, and in the worst acts and designs, observe the tenor of the objections with which the College-Green orators of the ascendency reproach the Catholics. You have observed, no doubt, how much they rely on the affair of Jackson. Is it not pleasant to hear Catholics reproached for a supposed connection--with whom?--with Protestant clergymen! with Protestant gentlemen! with Mr. Jackson! with Mr. Rowan, &c, &c.! But egomet mî ignosco. Conspiracies and treasons are privileged pleasures, not to be profaned by the impure and unhallowed touch of Papists. Indeed, all this will do, perhaps, well enough, with detachments of dismounted cavalry and fencibles from England. But let us not say to Catholics, by way of argument, that they are to be kept in a degraded state, because some of them are no better than many of us Protestants. The thing I most disliked in some of their speeches (those, I mean, of the Catholics) was what is called the spirit of liberality, so much and so diligently taught by the <b>ascendants,</b> by which they are made to abandon their own particular interests, and to merge them in the general discontents of the country. It gave me no pleasure to hear of the dissolution of the committee. There were in it a majority, to my knowledge, of very sober, well-intentioned men; and there were none in it but such who, if not continually goaded and irritated, might be made useful to the tranquillity of the country. It is right always to have a few of every description, through whom you may quietly operate on the many, both for the interests of the description, and for the general interest.|$|E

50|$|The Midheaven {{is always}} aligned with north or south. However, the <b>Ascendant</b> and Descendant are not {{necessarily}} aligned with east and west, so the <b>Ascendant</b> is not necessarily at 90 degrees to the Midheaven. The <b>Ascendant</b> is the degree of the ecliptic that intersects the eastern celestial horizon at a specific time and location. For observers in the tropics, this will always be close to due east and the <b>Ascendant</b> will always be close to 90 degrees away from the Midheaven. As the observer moves farther north or south it becomes possible for the <b>Ascendant</b> to be {{farther and farther away}} from due east.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ascendant</b> is the easternmost or sunrise {{point where}} the {{ecliptic}} and horizon intersect; the <b>ascendant</b> and the midheaven are considered the most important angles in the horoscope by {{the vast majority of}} astrologers.

The placement of the planetary ruler of the <b>ascendant,</b> called the chart ruler is also considered to be significant. The point in the west diametrically opposing the <b>ascendant</b> is called the descendant, normally the cusp of the 7th house; and the point opposing the M.C. is the cusp of the 4th house, the northernmost point of the chart, called the imum coeli or I.C.|$|R

Also important is the first planet to occupy the first, second, or third houses after the <b>ascendant.</b> Called the rising planet it will be particularly strong in the chart. If no planet occupies the first three houses, then a planet in the twelfth house close to the <b>ascendant</b> can be taken to be the rising planet. Planets that are in conjunction to (right beside) the primary angles of <b>ascendant,</b> midheaven, descendant, or IC (known as angular planets) must also be especially considered.|$|R
50|$|Another factor {{concerning}} {{the effect of}} the <b>ascendant</b> is the theory that people become more like their sun sign after around 29 years old, as they grow older and more confident and thus have less of a need to present a public face to others.

In Natal astrology, astrologers consider the house and sign placement of this planet to be of special importance in the shaping of a persons identity.

50|$|Planets {{can assume}} added {{importance}} in the birth chart due to {{their relationship to the}} <b>ascendant.</b> The planet that rules the astrological sign of the <b>ascendant</b> is called the chart ruler, and is said to be of particular importance. So for example, if the <b>ascendant</b> sign is Libra, Venus will be the chart ruler, and so 'set the tone' for the chart in many ways. In addition, the planet nearest the <b>ascendant</b> in the first house is usually called the rising planet and has a particular {{importance in the}} chart. However, if a planet in the twelfth house is very close (within one or two degrees) to the <b>ascendant,</b> then it can be taken to be the rising planet instead. If a planet is actually in conjunction with the <b>ascendant</b> it then becomes vitally important in its effect on the personality, to the extent of being almost as important as the sun in some cases. Finally, any planets in the first house will always have an added emphasis to them.|$|R
