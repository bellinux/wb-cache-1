The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the safety and feasibility of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>de-escalation</b> in patients admitted with bacteremic pneumonia. Methods: A retrospective chart review was done for patients with bacteremic pneumonia admitted to Northwest Texas Hospital in Amarillo, TX, USA, during 2008. <b>Antibiotic</b> <b>de-escalation</b> was defined as changing the empiric antibiotic regimen to a culture-directed single agent with a narrower spectrum than the original regimen. Results: Sixty-eight patients were admitted with bacteremic pneumonia. Eight patients were not eligible for de-escalation. Among the 60 patients who were eligible for de-escalation, the treating physicians failed to de-escalate antibiotics in 27 cases (45. 0 %). Discharge to a long-term care facility predicted failure to de-escalate antibiotics, while an infectious diseases consultation was significantly associated with <b>antibiotic</b> <b>de-escalation.</b> The average daily cost of antibacterial therapy in the de-escalation group was $ 25. 7 compared with $ 61. 6 in the group where de-escalation was not implemented. The difference in mean length of hospital stay and mortality between the two groups was not statistically significant. Conclusion: <b>Antibiotic</b> <b>de-escalation</b> is a safe management strategy but unfortunately is not widely adopted. Although bacterial resistance poses a significant threat and is rising, antimicrobial de-escalation has emerged as {{a potential}} intervention that can conserve the effectiveness of broad-spectrum antibiotics without compromising the patient&# 39;s outcome.

40|$|Purpose: <b>Antibiotic</b> <b>de-escalation</b> is {{promoted}} to limit prolonged exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics, but proof that it prevents {{the emergence of}} resistance is lacking. We evaluated determinants of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>de-escalation</b> {{in an attempt to}} assess whether the latter is associated with a lower emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Methods: Antibiotic treatments, starting with empirical beta-lactam prescriptions, were prospectively documented during 2013 and 2014 in a tertiary intensive care unit (ICU) and categorized as continuation, de-escalation or escalation of the empirical antimicrobial treatment. Determinants of the de-escalation or escalation treatments were identified by multivariate logistic regression; the continuation category was used as the reference group. Using systematically collected diagnostic and surveillance cultures, we estimated the cumulative incidence of antimicrobial resistance following de-escalation or continuation of therapy, with adjustment for ICU discharge and death as competing risks. Results: Of 478 anti-pseudomonal antibiotic prescriptions, 42 (9 %) were classified as escalation of the antimicrobial treatment and 121 (25 %) were classified as de-escalation, mainly through replacement of the originally prescribed antibiotics with those having a narrower spectrum. In multivariate analysis, de-escalation was associated with the identification of etiologic pathogens (p < 0. 001). The duration of the antibiotic course in the ICU in de-escalated versus continued prescriptions was 8 (range 6 - 10) versus 5 (range 4 - 7) days, respectively (p < 0. 001). Mortality did not differ between patients in the de-escalation and continuation categories. The cumulative incidence estimates of the emergence of resistance to the initial beta-lactam antibiotic on day 14 were 30. 6 and 23. 5 % for de-escalation and continuation, respectively (p = 0. 22). For the selection of multi-drug resistant pathogens, these values were 23. 5 (de-escalation) and 18. 6 % (continuation) respectively (p = 0. 35). Conclusion: The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria after exposure to anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam antibiotics was not lower following de-escalation...|$|E
40|$|Background: Recommendations for {{treatment}} of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) emphasize early empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, appropriate <b>antibiotic</b> <b>de-escalation</b> is also critical for optimal patient care. Materials and Methods: We examined how often intensivists in our institution appropriately de-escalated antibiotics in cases of suspected VAP, and whether decision support by intensive care unit pharmacists could improve rates of antibiotic targeting and early antibiotic discontinuation in low-risk patients. Main Results: A total of 92 (observation phase 50; intervention phase 42) patients with suspected VAP were identified. During the observation phase, 39 cases yielded positive sputum cultures, but in only 23 (59 %) were antibiotics targeted to culture results. This rate improved during the intervention phase when 29 (91 %) of 32 cases with positive cultures were targeted (P value. 003). There were 48 {{cases in which the}} risk of pneumonia was considered low. Of the 26 low-risk cases in the observation phase, 5 (19 %) had antibiotics discontinued early versus 5 (23 %) of the 22 cases in the intervention phase. Conclusions: Decision support by clinical pharmacists significantly improved rates of appropriate antibiotic targeting in cases of culture-positive suspected VAP but did not {{have a significant effect on}} early antibiotic discontinuation in patients at low risk of true pneumonia...|$|E

40|$|Efforts {{directed}} at maximizing {{use of the}} existing antibiotic armamentarium are essential due to persisting increases in antibiotic resistance and {{the limited number of}} new antibiotics in development. The intensive care unit (ICU) is an especially complex environment deserving of specific focus. Antibiotic prescription in the ICU is difficult {{because of the presence of}} poorly susceptible pathogens, and the dynamic physiology of critically ill patients, which combine to alter bacterial-antibiotic interaction leading to suboptimal treatment of infections. The main objective of this article is to discuss the principles for optimization of antibiotic therapy, specifically focusing on altered pharmacokinetics in the critically ill patient, and the rationale for dosage adjustments. Optimizing antibiotic therapy involves early initiation of appropriate <b>antibiotics,</b> <b>de-escalation</b> where appropriate, minimization of duration of therapy, and avoidance of drug interactions. Furthermore, current opinion suggests that there remains significant capacity for improved antibiotic dosing in the ICU. Application of knowledge of the effect of pathophysiology on drug pharmacokinetics and dose adjustments that adhere to pharmacodynamic principles will facilitate improved antibiotic dosing in these "at risk" ICU patients.

40|$|Drug allergy to {{antibiotics}} {{may occur}} {{in the form of}} immediate or non-immediate (delayed) hypersensitivity reactions. Immediate reactions are usually IgE-mediated whereas non-immediate hypersensitivity reactions are usually non-IgE or T-cell mediated. The clinical manifestations of antibiotic allergy may be cutaneous, organ-specific (e. g., blood dyscracias, hepatitis, interstitial nephritis), systemic (e. g., anaphylaxis, drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome) or various combinations of these. Severe cutaneous adverse reactions manifesting as Stevens Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) may be potentially life-threatening. The management of antibiotic allergy begins with the identification of the putative antibiotic from a detailed and accurate drug history, complemented by validated in-vivo and in-vitro allergological tests. This will facilitate avoidance of the putative antibiotic through patient education, use of drug alert cards, and electronic medical records with in-built drug allergy/adverse drug reaction prescription and dispensing checks. Knowledge of the evidence for specific antibiotic cross-reactivities is also important in patient education. Apart from withdrawal of the putative antibiotic, immunomodulatory agents like high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins may have a role in TEN. Drug desensitization where the benefits outweigh the risks, and where no alternative antibiotics can be used for various reasons, may be considered in certain situations. Allergological issues pertaining to electronic drug allergy alerts, computerized physician prescriptions and decision support systems, and <b>antibiotic</b> <b>de-escalation</b> in antimicrobial stewardship programmes are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Objective.  Development of a {{numerical}} score {{to measure the}} microbial spectrum of antibiotic regimens (spectrum score) and method to identify <b>antibiotic</b> <b>de-escalation</b> events based on application of the score. Design.  Web-based modified Delphi method. Participants.  Physician and pharmacist antimicrobial stewards practicing in the United States recruited through infectious diseases-focused listservs. Methods.  Three Delphi rounds investigated: organisms and antibiotics {{to include in the}} spectrum score, operationalization of rules for the score, and de-escalation measurement. A 4 -point ordinal scale was used to score antibiotic susceptibility for organism-antibiotic domain pairs. Antibiotic regimen scores, which represented combined activity of antibiotics in a regimen across all organism domains, were used to compare antibiotic spectrum administered early (day 2) and later (day 4) in therapy. Changes in spectrum score were calculated and compared with Delphi participants' judgments on de-escalation with 20 antibiotic regimen vignettes and with non-Delphi steward judgments on de-escalation of 300 pneumonia regimen vignettes. Method sensitivity and specificity to predict expert de-escalation status were calculated. Results.  Twenty-four participants completed all Delphi rounds. Expert support for concepts utilized in metric development was identified. For vignettes presented in the Delphi, the sign of change in score correctly classified de-escalation in all vignettes except those involving substitution of oral antibiotics. The sensitivity and specificity of the method to identify de-escalation events as judged by non-Delphi stewards were 86. 3 % and 96. 0 %, respectively. Conclusions.  Identification of de-escalation events based on an algorithm that measures microbial spectrum of antibiotic regimens generally agreed with steward judgments of de-escalation status...|$|E
40|$|Published {{guidelines}} {{for the treatment of}} healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) recommend initial broad-spectrum antibiotics with appropriate de-escalation based on culture results. Guideline recommendations are based on data from intubated patients, in whom cultures are easily obtained. The approach to <b>antibiotic</b> <b>de-escalation</b> for culture-negative patients has not been addressed. Consequently, there are no published reports that describe the current standard of practice. All patients admitted to a university hospital with a diagnosis of HCAP, as defined by use of a pneumonia orderset, were identified retrospectively over a 2 -year period. Antibiotics prescribed on admission, during hospital stay, and on discharge were recorded. De-escalation was defined as a change in the initial antibiotic therapy from broad- to narrow-spectrum coverage within 14  days of the initial prescription. The Pneumonia Severity Index was used for risk-adjustment. A total of 102 patients were included in the analysis; of these, 72 % (n =  73) were culture-negative. There were more males in the culture-negative than culture-positive group; otherwise, baseline characteristics were similar. Antibiotic therapy was de-escalated in 75 % of the culture-negative group and 77 % of the culture-positive group (p =  1. 00). Culture-negative patients were de-escalated approximately 1  day earlier than culture-positive patients (3. 93 vs. 5. 04  days, p =  0. 03). Culture-negative patients who were de-escalated had a shorter length of hospitalization, lower hospital costs, and lower mortality rates. In 70 % of the culture-negative patients, a respiratory fluoroquinolone was chosen for de-escalation. In this single-center study, most of the patients with culture-negative HCAP were safely de-escalated to a respiratory fluoroquinolone...|$|E

This review will present several strategies aimed at achieving optimal use of antimicrobial agents. It is important to note that each intensive care unit should have a program in place which monitors antibiotic utilization and its effectiveness.

40|$|SUMMARYPneumonia is {{the leading}} cause of infection-related death and {{represents}} the fifth cause of mortality in the elderly. There are several reported risk factors for acquiring pneumonia at an older age, such as alcoholism, lung and heart diseases, nursing home residence, and swallowing disorders. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is reviewed, with an emphasis on multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The clinical characteristics of pneumonia in the elderly differ substantially compared with younger patients, and the severity of the disease is strongly associated with increased age and age-related comorbid disorders. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the pathogen most frequently responsible for pneumonia in the elderly with early HAP without risk factors for MDR; enteric Gram-negative rods should be considered in nursing home-associated pneumonia, as well as anaerobes in patients with aspiration pneumonia. Special attention should be given to preventive measures such as vaccination, oral care, and nutrition. The management of HAP should be instituted early with: appropriate use of antibiotics in adequate doses; avoidance of excessive use of <b>antibiotics</b> by <b>de-escalation</b> of initial <b>antibiotic</b> therapy, based on microbiologic cultures and the clinical response of the patient; and reduction of the duration of treatment to the minimum effective period...|$|R
40|$|Defining the {{severity}} of an infection can {{play a central role}} for a correct therapeutic choice, avoiding inadequate antimicrobial treatments. Severe bacterial infections are, in fact, characterized by high morbidity and mortality rates so that the appropriateness of therapy can have a profound clinical impact. Indeed, initial inappropriate empirical therapies, and the further need to modify them, substantially increase the mortality risk. Several strategies have been suggested to improve the clinical outcome of patients affected by severe bacterial infections, {{such as the use of}} guidelines, use of <b>antibiotics</b> in combination, <b>de-escalation</b> therapy, cycling therapy and the use of infectious disease specialist consultation. A closer collaboration between the medical staff in the wards and infectious disease specialists can possibly bridge the gap between different strategies and individual needs of the patient, thereby improving the decision-making process...|$|R
40|$|In {{the study}} by Lacroix and colleagues [1] in the {{previous}} issue of Critical Care, we appreciate the early use of the mini-bronchoalveolar lavage (mini-BAL) to diagnose health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP). However, some {{limitations of the study}} create difficulties in initiating this protocol in our institution. Hospitalized/intubated patients with HCAP were not studied. These patients represent a significant fraction of those undergoing blood culture/mini-BAL for diagnosis. In our population, emergency physicians dispense broad-spectrum antibiotics expediently as a quality measure; therefore, subsequent mini-BAL may yield few results. The article did not present final antibiotic selections, patient outcomes, or <b>antibiotic</b> <b>de-escalation.</b> We cannot estimate the final cost of the antibiotic course or compare it with the cost of mini-BAL/bronchoscopy. The antibiotics might not be more cost-effective than the procedure. Mini-BAL without bronchoscopy may be cost-effective but has low yield [2]; 31. 5 % patients had altered mental status, contraindicating bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) during mini-BAL [3]. We do not know whether sedation (which may be risky) was used. Results of mini-BAL culture are compared with those of blood cultures. Blood cultures in community-acquired pneumonia/HCAP (CAP/HCAP) have limitations. Only high-risk patients benefit from blood culture in diag nosing CAP. Also, with prior antibiotics, blood culture sensitivity for CAP/HCAP diagnosis decreases [4]. We do not know whether HCAP organisms were distinguished from colonizing flora. We applaud the trial as conducted but feel that the inclusion of a comparison of cost, technical descriptions of the mini-BAL in regard to the need for bronchoscopy and sedation, inclusion of hospitalized/intubated patients, choice of antibiotics/de-escalation, and use of antibiotics prior to enrollment would more effectively support the authors ’ conclusions...|$|E
40|$|Antimicrobial {{stewardship}} {{programs are}} implemented {{to optimize the}} use of antibiotics and control the spread of antibiotic resistance. Many antimicrobial stewardship interventions have demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics, the duration of antimicrobial therapy, and mortality. We evaluated {{the benefits of a}} combination of rapid diagnostic tests and an active re-evaluation of antibiotic therapy 72 h after the onset of bloodstream infection (BSI). All patients with BSI from November 2015 to November 2016 in a 1100 -bed university hospital in Rome, where an Infectious Disease Consultancy Unit (UnitÃ  di Consulenza Infettivologica, UDCI) is available, were re-evaluated at the bedside 72 h after starting antimicrobial therapy and compared to two pre-intervention periods: the UDCI was called by the ward physician for patients with BSI and the UDCI was called directly by the microbiologist immediately after a pathogen was isolated from blood cultures. Recommendations for <b>antibiotic</b> <b>de-escalation</b> or discontinuation significantly increased (54 %) from the two pre-intervention periods (32 % and 27. 2 %, p < 0. 0001). Appropriate escalation also significantly increased (22. 5 %) from the pre-intervention periods (8. 1 % and 8. 2 %, p < 0. 0001). The total duration of antibiotic therapy decreased with intervention (from 21. 9 days [standard deviation, SD 15. 4] in period 1 to 19. 3 days [SD 13. 3] in period 2 to 17. 7 days in period 3 [SD 11. 5]; p = 0. 002) and the length of stay was significantly shorter (from 29. 7 days [SD 29. 3] in period 1 to 26. 8 days [SD 24. 7] in period 2 to 24. 2 days in period 3 [SD 20. 7]; p = 0. 04) than in the two pre-intervention periods. Mortality was similar among the study periods (31 patients died in period 1 (15. 7 %), 39 (16. 7 %) in period 2, and 48 (15. 3 %) in period 3; p = 0. 90). Rapid diagnostic tests and 72 h re-evaluation of empirical therapy for BSI significantly correlated with an improved rate of optimal antibiotic therapy and decreased duration of antibiotic therapy and length of stay...|$|E

40|$|Objective: to {{elucidate}} a {{role of the}} most significant risk factors in the development of outcomes of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Subjects and materials. In 1997 — 2006, the intensive care units of Novokuznetsk observed 77 children with VAP (a study group) and 30 patients without VANP who were on artificial ventilation (AV) for more than 2 days (a control group). In the group of VAP, there was a preponderance of babies of the first year of life (p= 0. 0097), children with the baseline pathology (p= 0. 0145), severe underlying diseases, multiply organ dysfunction (p= 0. 0388) who were long on AV. Sputum gram-negative microorganisms were shown to be isolated statistically significantly more frequently (p= 0. 0005). Conclusion. Antibacterial therapy should be started with a combination of reserve <b>antibiotics</b> by the <b>de-escalation</b> scheme. In children with VAP, the predictors of poor prognosis are a bilateral process; the preservation of fever in the patients on adequate antibacterial therapy and/or the preservation of the microorganism; a low (< 300) oxygenation index; no positive X-ray changes.

40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} {{observational study}} was to determine the accuracy of American Thoracic Society (ATS) /Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) criteria in predicting infection or colonization related to multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria at intensive-care unit (ICU) admission. MDR bacteria were defined as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, ceftazidime-resistant or imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacilli. Screening for MDR bacteria (using nasal and rectal swabs and tracheal aspirates from intubated patients) was performed at ICU admission. Risk factors for infection or colonization with MDR bacteria at ICU admission were determined using univariate and multivariate analyses. The accuracy of ATS/IDSA criteria in predicting infection or colonization with these bacteria at ICU admission was calculated. Eighty-three (13 %) of 625 patients were infected or colonized with MDR bacteria at ICU admission. Multivariate analysis allowed identification of prior antimicrobial treatment (OR 2. 3, 95 % CI 1. 2 – 4. 3; p 0. 008), residence in a nursing home (OR 2, 95 % CI 1. 1 – 3. 7; p < 0. 001), and prior hospitalization (OR 3. 9, 95 % CI 1. 7 – 8. 8; p < 0. 001) as independent predictors of infection or colonization with MDR bacteria at ICU admission. Although sensitivity (89 %) and negative predictive values (96 %) were high, low specificity (39 %) and a positive predictive value (18 %) were found when ATS/IDSA criteria were used in predicting infection or colonization with MDR bacteria at ICU admission. In patients with pneumonia, adherence to guidelines was associated with increased rates of appropriate initial <b>antibiotic</b> treatment and <b>de-escalation.</b> ATS/IDSA criteria had an excellent negative predictive value and a low positive predictive value concerning infection or colonization with MDR bacteria at ICU admission...|$|R
