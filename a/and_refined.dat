5|$|This model, {{known as}} the nebular hypothesis, was first {{developed}} in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy, physics, geology, and planetary science.

The Anekantavada doctrine is satkaryavada in explaining causes, and the asatkaryavada in explaining qualities or attributes in the effects.

5|$|Capcom's {{partnership}} with Marvel Comics began in 1993 {{with the release}} of The Punisher, an arcade beat 'em up based on the comic book series of the same name. Capcom then created their first Marvel-based fighting game, X-Men: Children of the Atom, in 1994. Marvel Super Heroes soon followed in 1995. Many of the gameplay mechanics used in the Marvel vs. Capcom series were first developed <b>and</b> <b>refined</b> in these two fighting games, serving as precursors to the series. In 2011, then-current Capcom USA Strategic Marketing Director of Online and Community Seth Killian stated that many fighting game aficionados, including himself, consider them to have laid the foundation for the series.|$|E
5|$|Deep frying {{produces}} {{large amounts}} of waste oil, which must be disposed of properly. Waste oil can overflow sewage systems, bind to the walls of sewage pipes, and interfere with sewage treatment. Waste oil from deep frying is increasingly being recycled <b>and</b> <b>refined</b> into biodiesel. Potatoes that are stored in artificially humidified warehouses contain more water, which makes {{the time required to}} deep fry them into chips longer. This increases the carbon dioxide footprint of commercially producing chips because more energy is required for frying over a longer time. According to one source, an average home appliance deep fryer draws 2,000 watts.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the success}} of the game, Atlus decided to create a sequel, but instead of {{continuing}} to adapt Nishitani's work, they created an original story with an expanded narrative <b>and</b> <b>refined</b> gameplay.

Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei was the first game in the Megami Tensei series, with Atlus eventually buying the rights to the franchise and turning the series into their most famous intellectual property. Megami Tensei has been called the third most popular RPG series in Japan after Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy, and gone on to include multiple subseries and expansions into other media.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert White's Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne (1789) holds {{a unique}} {{position}} in English literature as the solitary classic of natural history. It {{is not easy to}} give, in a few words, a reason for its remarkable success. It is, in fact, not so much a logically arranged and systematic book as an invaluable record of the life work of a simple <b>and</b> <b>refined</b> man who succeeded in picturing himself as well as what he saw. The reader is carried along by his interest in the results of far-sighted observation; but, more than this, the reader imbibes the spirit of the writer which pervades the whole book and endears it to like-minded naturalists as a valued companion.|$|E
5|$|Pink Floyd {{recorded}} The Dark Side of the Moon between May 1972 and January 1973, with EMI staff engineer Alan Parsons at Abbey Road. The {{title is}} {{an allusion to}} lunacy rather than astronomy. The band had composed <b>and</b> <b>refined</b> the material on Dark Side while touring the UK, Japan, North America and Europe. Producer Chris Thomas assisted Parsons. Hipgnosis designed the album's packaging, which included George Hardie's iconic refracting prism design on the cover. Thorgerson's Dark Side album cover features a beam of white light, representing unity, passing through a prism, which represents society. The resulting refracted beam of coloured light symbolises unity diffracted, leaving an absence of unity. Waters is the sole author of the album's lyrics.|$|E

5|$|The Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev {{published}} the first widely recognized periodic table in 1869.

Most of his predictions were proved correct when the elements in question were subsequently discovered. Mendeleev's periodic table has since been expanded <b>and</b> <b>refined</b> with the discovery or synthesis of further new elements and the development of new theoretical models to explain chemical behaviour.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea that}} matter {{is made up}} of {{discrete}} units is a very old one, appearing in many ancient cultures such as Greece and India. However, these ideas were founded in philosophical and theological reasoning rather than evidence and experimentation.

It was not until the 19th century that the idea was embraced <b>and</b> <b>refined</b> by scientists, as the blossoming science of chemistry produced discoveries that could easily be explained using the concept of atoms.|$|E
