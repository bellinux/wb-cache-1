50|$|A normal {{arrestment}} {{is accomplished}} when the arresting hook of an incoming aircraft engages {{one of the}} deck pendants. When a landing aircraft engages a deck pendant, {{the force of the}} forward motion of the landing aircraft is transferred to a purchase cable which is routed via sheaves to the arresting engine, located in a machinery room below the flight deck or {{on either side of the}} runway. As the deck pendant and the purchase cable are pulled out by the <b>aircraft</b> being <b>arrested,</b> the kinetic energy of the aircraft is transferred to mechanical energy of the cables, and the arresting engine transfers the mechanical energy of the cables to hydraulic energy. The arresting engine brings about a smooth, controlled stop of the landing aircraft. At the completion of the arrestment, the <b>aircraft</b> <b>arresting</b> hook is disengaged from the deck pendant, which is then retracted to its normal position.|$|R

40|$|Objectives] Considering the {{shortcomings}} of the traditional sheave damper in buffer performance and the peak value of the greatest cable tension, [Methods] this paper presents a sheave damper with variable damping according to piston displacement {{as a replacement for}} the traditional sheave damper, and AMESim software is used for the modeling and simulation. [Results] The results show that the new sheave damper can significantly improve the arresting gear performance indicators, and has better adaptability for aircraft impact load. Compared with the traditional sheave damper, the new method can reduce cable tension by 25 % and reduce the maximum deceleration of aircraft by 23 %. [Conclusions] As such, the research in this paper can provide a theoretical reference for improving the performance of <b>aircraft</b> <b>arresting</b> gear...|$|R

50|$|Aside from {{landing gear}} brakes, most large {{aircraft}} have {{other ways of}} decelerating. In aircraft, air brakes are aerodynamic surfaces that create friction, with the air flow causing the vehicle to slow. These are usually implemented as flaps that oppose air flow when extended and are flush with aircraft when retracted. Reverse thrust is also used in many aeroplane engines. Propeller aircraft achieve reverse thrust by reversing the pitch of the propellers, while jet aircraft do so by redirecting their engine exhaust forwards. On <b>aircraft</b> carriers, <b>arresting</b> gears are used to stop an aircraft. Pilots may even apply full forward throttle on touchdown, in case the arresting gear does not catch and a go around is needed.|$|R
