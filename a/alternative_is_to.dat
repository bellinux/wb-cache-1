5|$|Although the A303 as a {{whole is}} {{designed}} {{to be part of a}} route from London to Exeter, a popular <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> take the M4 motorway to Bristol, followed by the M5. Although this is a high-quality motorway route throughout, it is a considerably further distance.|$|E
5|$|An <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> test {{respondents}} at the researcher's {{facility with}} opening statements or a full-blown mock trial instead of reading a case summary over the telephone. The higher {{cost of a}} mock trial allows for a more realistic portrayal of the real trial and (researchers hope) more accurate data. It also provides a better opportunity to question the subjects, {{before and after the}} trial simulation. On the other hand, telephone surveys provide a larger and more representative sample of the jury pool. Diamond indicates that since both methods have advantages, SJS practitioners commonly rely on both in the same case.|$|E
5|$|Seven trails with round-trip {{times of}} {{half an hour}} (Weeping Rock) to 4 hours (Angels Landing) are found in Zion Canyon. Two popular trails, Taylor Creek (4 hours round trip) and Kolob Arch (8 hours round trip), are in the Kolob Canyons section of the park, near Cedar City. Hiking up into The Narrows from the Temple of Sinawava is popular in summer. However, hiking beyond Big Springs {{requires}} a permit. The entire Narrows from Chamberlain's Ranch is a 16-mile one way trip that typically takes 12 hours of strenuous hiking. A shorter <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> enter the Narrows via Orderville Canyon. Both Orderville and the full Narrows require a back country permit. Entrance to the Parunuweap Canyon section of the park downstream of Labyrinth Falls is prohibited. Other often-used backcountry trails include the West Rim and LaVerkin Creek. The more primitive sections of Zion include the Kolob Terrace and the Kolob Canyons.|$|E
30|$|To {{calculate}} the total loss of any alternative, initially the loss caused by each attribute {{of that particular}} <b>alternative</b> has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> calculated. <b>To</b> {{calculate the}} loss caused by each attribute, the attributes of the chosen <b>alternative</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{compared with those of}} IBA.|$|R
5000|$|... (6) Disjunction: [...] "If p and q are any {{proposition}}s, {{the proposition}} [...] "p or q, i.e., [...] "either p is true or q is true," [...] where the <b>alternatives</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> not mutually exclusive, will {{be represented by}} [...] "p ∨ q" [...] ".|$|R
5000|$|In 2012, the Canadian and Danish governments <b>were</b> close <b>to</b> an {{agreement}} to declare Hans Island a condominium, after decades in dispute. Another considered <b>alternative</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> divide the island in half. Negotiations continued.|$|R
5|$|The {{second type}} of press design is the cubic press. A cubic press has six anvils which provide {{pressure}} simultaneously onto all faces of a cube-shaped volume. The first multi-anvil press design was a tetrahedral press, using four anvils to converge upon a tetrahedron-shaped volume. The cubic press was created shortly thereafter to increase the volume to which pressure could be applied. A cubic press is typically smaller than a belt press and can more rapidly achieve the pressure and temperature necessary to create synthetic diamond. However, cubic presses cannot be easily scaled up to larger volumes: the pressurized volume can be increased by using larger anvils, but this also increases the amount of force needed on the anvils {{to achieve the same}} pressure. An <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> decrease the surface area to volume ratio of the pressurized volume, by using more anvils to converge upon a higher-order platonic solid, such as a dodecahedron. However, such a press would be complex and difficult to manufacture.|$|E
25|$|An {{expensive}} but exciting <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> charter a seaplane to {{tour the}} lights in the straits.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> charter a {{seaplane}} {{to make a}} tour of the Mackinac Straits and environs.|$|E
30|$|In [14] we showed, empirically, {{that the}} best <b>alternative</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> use the Ensemble {{algorithms}} (Alternative 2) for the classification problem. Consequently we have used the results provided from this alternative in the experiments.|$|R
5000|$|Transitivity - if <b>alternative</b> a1 <b>is</b> {{preferred}} <b>to</b> a2, and <b>alternative</b> a2 <b>is</b> preferred <b>to</b> a3, then a1 <b>is</b> preferred <b>to</b> a3.|$|R
50|$|A {{transverse}} inframammary incision {{with free}} nipple areolar grafts {{may be one}} approach. If {{there is too much}} blousing of the skin, the <b>alternatives</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> extend the incision laterally (chasing a dog ear) or to make a vertical midline incision (inverted T).|$|R
25|$|The {{antidote}} for uranium {{in humans}} is bicarbonate, {{which is used}} because uranium (VI) forms complexes with carbonate. An <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use tiron (sodium 4,5-dihydroxybenzene-1,3-disulfonate).|$|E
25|$|The {{apostrophe}} {{is sometimes}} used in forming the plural of numbers, for example 1000’s of years. An <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> write out the numbers as words.|$|E
25|$|Among {{indirect}} ascents, {{a popular}} <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> climb Sour Milk Gill from Seathwaite in Borrowdale, first ascending Green Gable before traversing Windy Gap.|$|E
5000|$|To reduce {{outer edge}} distortions {{and provide a}} {{panoramic}} view, large curved screens accomplish this free of [...] lines framing each screen, and the <b>alternative</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> use multiple flat-screen monitors around the viewer. Curved screens and multi-screens have applications in gaming.|$|R
60|$|The {{truth of}} this was obvious, for the <b>alternative</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> freeze to death. He managed {{to keep up with}} the others, though Carnally slackened the pace all the afternoon. When they camped at nightfall, Graham would not let him examine his foot.|$|R
5000|$|In general, {{three main}} <b>alternatives</b> <b>were</b> {{presented}} <b>to</b> Puerto Rican voters in status plebiscites: ...|$|R
25|$|The <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{make use}} of Aiken Beck, a car park being {{available}} near Scawgill Bridge on the Whinlatter Pass road. From the valley the southern slopes of Broom Fell can be tackled direct, or a longer route can be taken via the summit of Lord's Seat.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{have the}} {{candidates}} themselves create an ordered list of successors before leaving their seat. In the European Parliament, a departing Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland member is {{replaced with the}} top eligible name from a replacement list submitted by the candidate {{at the time of}} the original election.|$|E
25|$|Techniques for {{eliminating}} centipedes from homes include {{drying up}} {{the areas where}} they thrive, eliminating large indoor insect populations, sealing cracks in the walls, pouring bleach down shower and sink drains, and seeking the assistance of an exterminator. An <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> let them live, allowing them to control pests, e.g., roaches, flies, moths, bed bugs, silverfish, earwigs, etc.|$|E
50|$|Bronfman {{has said}} that the Two State Solution is the only humane {{solution}} to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The unacceptable <b>alternatives</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> have a mass deportation of Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank, or to brutally rule over the Palestinians in these territories.|$|R
50|$|During the Second World War, Kalay was an {{important}} regrouping point for the British during their retreat from Burma in 1942 because of the relatively easier access to India along the Manipur River (the <b>alternative</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> march through malarial forests from Kalewa to Tamu).|$|R
50|$|Many {{of these}} <b>alternatives</b> <b>were</b> {{designed}} <b>to</b> avoid or balance the ethnic connotations of Pakhtunkhwa.|$|R
25|$|Another <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> equip {{the vehicle}} {{with a single}} wiper placed in {{the centre of the}} windshield, {{allowing}} it to cover both sides of the windshield. This mitigates the amount of drag by decreasing the frontal area of the blade. While such application may be useful for racing, for most road vehicles this would produce minimal improvement in overall drag reduction.|$|E
25|$|One <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{establish}} an extra locomotive at Loenga, {{which would require}} an upgrade of the track alignment at Loenga. Although this would cut some costs, it would still delay each train by about 25 minutes and requires additional tracks at both Loenga and Alnabru. Although freight trains from the Østfold Line pass through Loenga, those from the Sørlandet Line do not, causing additional delays.|$|E
25|$|A third <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use a {{radioactive}} label {{rather than an}} enzyme coupled to the secondary antibody, such as labeling an antibody-binding protein like Staphylococcus Protein A or Streptavidin with a radioactive isotope of iodine. Since other methods are safer, quicker, and cheaper, this method is now rarely used; however, an advantage {{of this approach is}} the sensitivity of auto-radiography-based imaging, which enables highly accurate protein quantification when combined with optical software (e.g. Optiquant).|$|E
5000|$|An <b>alternative</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> build a [...] "pusher" [...] scout {{such as the}} Airco DH.2, {{with the}} {{propeller}} mounted behind the pilot. The main drawback was that the high drag of a pusher type's tail structure made it slower than a similar [...] "tractor" [...] aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|If no <b>alternatives</b> <b>are</b> {{available}} <b>to</b> its neighbours, England should {{charge more}} money for its exports.|$|R
60|$|The only <b>alternative</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{wait for}} the regular packet, which sailed some hours later--between eight and nine o'clock in the forenoon. In this case, they might apply for their {{passports}} before the regular office hours, if they explained the circumstances, backed by {{the authority of the}} magistrate's letter.|$|R
25|$|Most {{commentators}} divide Numbers {{into three}} sections based on locale (Mount Sinai, Kadesh-Barnea and {{the plains of}} Moab), linked by two travel sections; an <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> see it as structured around the two generations of those condemned {{to die in the}} wilderness and the new generation who will enter Canaan, making a theological distinction between the disobedience of the first generation and the obedience of the second.|$|E
25|$|In {{more complex}} situations, the main ebb and flood flows do not dominate. Instead, the flow {{direction}} and magnitude trace an ellipse over a tidal cycle (on a polar plot) instead of along {{the ebb and}} flood lines. In this case, analysis might proceed along pairs of directions, with the primary and secondary directions at right angles. An <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> treat the tidal flows as complex numbers, as each value has both a magnitude and a direction.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{read the}} books in their {{original}} order of publication, since reading the Foundation prequels prior to reading the Foundation Trilogy fundamentally alters the original narrative structure of the trilogy by spoiling what were originally presented as plot surprises. In that same Author's Note, Asimov noted that {{there is room for}} a book between Robots and Empire (5) and The Currents of Space (6), and that he could follow Foundation and Earth (15) with additional volumes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{proposal}} (with its <b>alternatives)</b> <b>are</b> presented <b>to</b> {{voters for}} ratification {{in a public}} vote or referendum ...|$|R
50|$|Because LAUNCHcast {{was only}} {{compatible}} with Internet Explorer, an <b>alternative</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> use the Yahoo Music Engine, which was called Jukebox in version 2 {{of the same}} software. The Jukebox <b>was</b> unable <b>to</b> stream music anymore following September 2008, although it remained available for download well into the following year.|$|R
5000|$|Negation: {{the symbol}} ¬ {{appeared}} in Heyting in 1929. (compare to Freges symbol [...] in his Begriffsschrift); the symbol ~ appeared in Russell in 1908; an <b>alternative</b> notation <b>is</b> <b>to</b> add an horizontal line {{on top of}} the formula, as in another <b>alternative</b> notation <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use a prime symbol as in P.|$|R
