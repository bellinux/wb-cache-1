40|$|Abstract- All {{measurement}} processes cause {{certain amount}} of random variations in the signal; this phenomenon is called noise. The procedure to reduce or smooth the noise of a measured signal {{is commonly known as}} filtering. In this paper we present the use of Mathcad software for the implementation and analysis of the moving <b>average</b> and Savitzky-Golay <b>filters.</b> The moving <b>average</b> <b>filter</b> is the simplest digital filter to understand and use. As its name suggests, this <b>filter</b> operates by <b>averaging</b> a number of points in a recursive fashion. In spite of its simplicity, the moving <b>average</b> <b>filter</b> is effective for time domain encoded signals. The Saviztky-Golay filter is based on the least squares polynomial fitting across a moving window within the data in the time domain. Generally, a high order polynomial (n= 4) allows a high level of smoothing without attenuation of data features. By contrast, the Saviztky-Golay filtering method is better than averaging because it tends to preserve data features such as peak height and width, which are usually attenuated by the moving <b>average</b> <b>filter.</b> By means of the Mathcad software, moving <b>average</b> and Savitzky-Golay <b>filters</b> were successfully applied to the smoothing of photochemical and electrochemical reactor data...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOne of the {{challenges}} of implementing differential data privacy, is that the utility (usefulness) of the privatized data tends to diminish even as confidentiality is guaranteed. In such settings, due to excessive noise, original data suffers loss of statistical significance despite the strong levels of confidentiality assured by differential privacy. This in turn makes the privatized data practically valueless to the consumer of the published data. Additionally, researchers have noted that finding equilibrium between data privacy and utility requirements remains intractable, necessitating trade- offs. Therefore, as a contribution, we propose using the moving <b>average</b> <b>filtering</b> model for non-interactive differential privacy settings. In this model, various levels of differential privacy (DP) are applied to a data set, generating a variety of privatized data sets. The privatized data is passed through a moving <b>average</b> <b>filter</b> and the new filtered privatized data sets that meet a set utility threshold are finally published. Preliminary {{results from this study}} show that adjustment of ɛ epsilon parameter in the differential privacy process, and the application of the moving <b>average</b> <b>filter</b> might generate better data utility output while conserving privacy in non-interactive differential privacy settings...|$|R
