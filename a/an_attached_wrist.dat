50|$|Henshin Kigen is used {{mainly by}} the string {{instrument}} based Kamen Riders. These {{are considered to}} be uncommon, but neither as rare as the Onibue or as common as the Onsa. The Henshin Kigen is <b>a</b> <b>wrist</b> device, <b>attached</b> the <b>wrist,</b> the user pulls on a chain that lifts a face plate on the Henshin Kigen. The user the plugs the strings and their body is filled with a powerful burst of lightning as they transform.|$|R

40|$|Device {{designed}} {{in the form of}} <b>a</b> <b>wrist</b> watch <b>attached</b> to the <b>wrist</b> having a housing (2) and a wrist strap (3) and at least one ultrasonic sensor <b>attached</b> to the <b>wrist</b> strap (3) comprising at least one ultrasonic emitter and one ultrasonic receiver and directed onto the radial artery in conjunction with an electronic evaluation device accommodated in the housing (2) for the detection and display (24) of circulation parameters, in particular the pulse rate, which can be derived from the systolic signals supplied by the sensor (1) {{as a result of the}} ultrasonic Doppler effect. The sensor (1) is designed and <b>attached</b> to the <b>wrist</b> strap (3) so that the systolic signals can be optimized on applying the device and this condition is maintained irrespective of hand and arm movements. Interference signals which can still not be eliminated in this way are prevented from having an effect on the display (24) of the device by a suitably designed evaluation device. A further development permits the de tection and display of the systolic blood pressure and the myocardial oxygen requirement...|$|R
50|$|The strappado, {{also known}} as corda, {{is a form of}} torture wherein the victim's hands are tied behind his or her back and {{suspended}} by <b>a</b> rope <b>attached</b> to the <b>wrists,</b> typically resulting in dislocated shoulders. Weights may be added to the body to intensify the effect and increase the pain. This kind of torture would generally not last more than an hour, without rest, as it would likely result in death.|$|R
40|$|Actigraphy is an {{emerging}} technology for measuring a patient’s overall activity level nearly continuously over time. An actigraph is <b>a</b> watch–like device <b>attached</b> to the <b>wrist</b> or ankle that uses an accelerometer to measure movement every minute, {{or even more}} often. Actigraphy data {{can best be described}} as functional data. In this paper, we will present exploratory graphical displays for various components of functional actigraphy data...|$|R

50|$|It is also {{probable}} {{that members of}} the Egyptian Labour Corps were 'sealed' like members of the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps by <b>a</b> seal being <b>attached</b> to their <b>wrists.</b> Initially the periods of service appear to have started as quite short term but became very long term as their importance was recognised and the difficulty of finding more recruits increased. By the first half of 1918 riots, blamed on bad recruitment methods employed to find more workers for the Egyptian Labour Corps, began to occur.|$|R

40|$|Emotion {{recognition}} through physiological recording is {{an emerging}} {{field of research}} with many promising results. This work {{is involved in the}} construction of a device used to identify basic human emotions indexed by Electro Dermal Activity (EDA) in real time, using <b>a</b> non-invasive sensor <b>attached</b> to <b>a</b> <b>wrist</b> band. We refer to the system as "E Lock-Holmes". The device measures changes in Skin Conductance Level (SCL) caused due to stimulating signals from brain which results from sympathetic neural activity using Ag/AgCl electrodes placed on the ventral side of the distal forearm to evaluate the emotions of the user outside the constrained laboratory environment without interrupting the normal daily routine. The device consists of an embedded system for EDA signal acquisition and a wireless communication module to send processed EDA signals to a remote system. <b>A</b> vibrator <b>attached</b> to the device is used to provide user feedback...|$|R
