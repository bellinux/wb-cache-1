50|$|The {{addition}} of scandium to aluminium creates nanoscale Al3Sc precipitates which limit the excessive grain growth {{that occurs in}} the heat-affected zone of welded aluminium components. This has two beneficial effects: the precipitated Al3Sc forms smaller crystals than are formed in other aluminium alloys and the width of precipitate-free zones that normally exist at the grain boundaries of <b>age-hardenable</b> aluminium alloys is reduced. Scandium is also a potent grain refiner in cast aluminium alloys, and atom for atom, the most potent strengthener in aluminium, both {{as a result of}} grain refinement and precipitation strengthening.|$|E

Using examples from a maraging steel, a nickel-base superalloy and a scandium-containing aluminium alloy, we demonstrate that precipitation can already occur during {{the production of the}} powders used as starting material, during the deposition of material (i. e. during solidification and subsequent cooling), during the intrinsic heat treatment effected by LAM (i. e. in the heat affected zones) and, naturally, during an ageing post-heat treatment.

The results from these experiments demonstrate that successful pressing may be undertaken by conducting the pressing operation very quickly (typically within < 10 min) following a water quench from the solution heat-treatment temperature. It is also shown that there is a significant increase in strength in the alloys even when the ECAP is performed through only a single pass.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{producing}} new superplastic alloys by inducing in an alloy {{the formation of}} precipitates having a sufficient size and homogeneous distribution that a sufficiently refined grain structure to produce superplasticity is obtained after subsequent PSN processing. An <b>age-hardenable</b> alloy having at least one dispersoid phase is selected for processing. The alloy is solution heat-treated and cooled to form a supersaturated solid solution. The alloy is plastically deformed sufficiently to form a high-energy defect structure useful for the subsequent heterogeneous nucleation of precipitates. The alloy is then aged, preferably by a multi-stage low and high temperature process, and precipitates are formed at the defect sites. The alloy then is subjected to a PSN process comprising plastically deforming the alloy to provide sufficient strain energy in the alloy to ensure recrystallization, and statically recrystallizing the alloy. A grain structure exhibiting new, fine, equiaxed and uniform grains is produced in the alloy.

40|$|The {{effects of}} boron doping on the {{microstructural}} evolution and mechanical and electrical properties of <b>age-hardenable</b> Cu– 4 Ti (at. %) alloys are investigated. In the quenched Cu– 4 Ti– 0. 03 B (at. %) alloy, elemental B (boron) is preferentially segregated at the grain {{boundaries of the}} supersaturated solid-solution phase. The aging behavior of the B-doped alloy is mostly {{similar to that of}} conventional <b>age-hardenable</b> Cu–Ti alloys. In the early stage of aging at 450 °C, metastable β′-Cu 4 Ti with fine needle-shaped precipitates continuously form in the matrix phase. Cellular discontinuous precipitates composed of the stable β-Cu 4 Ti and solid-solution laminates are then formed and grown at the grain boundaries. However, the volume fraction of the discontinuous precipitates is lower in the Cu– 4 Ti– 0. 03 B alloy than the Cu– 4 Ti alloy, particularly in the over-aging period of 72 – 120 h. The suppression of the formation of discontinuous precipitates eventually results in improvement of the hardness and tensile strength. It should be noted that minor B doping of Cu–Ti alloys also effectively enhances the elongation to fracture, which should be attributed to segregation of B at the grain boundaries...|$|E

30|$|In recent days, {{the lighter}} {{material}} {{is used to}} construct the light combat vehicles to improve its mobility (Børvik et al. 2011). Among the lighter materials, copper-containing high strength aluminium alloy is the potential candidate which exhibits high toughness and high specific strength {{to fit into the}} armour applications. AA 2519 -T 87 is a new generation <b>age-hardenable</b> armour grade aluminium alloy which has good ballistic properties. It is presently well demonstrated that friction stir welding (FSW) process can join aluminium plates with better joint properties over other welding processes (Barcellona et al. 2006; Gachi et al. 2011). The low heat input during FSW avoids the solidification defects and also avoids deteriorated metallurgical transformation that occur at the elevated temperatures (Shukla and Baeslack 2007). Despite, the heat generated during FSW can alter the precipitation behaviour of the aluminium material. The strength and hardness of the <b>age-hardenable</b> aluminium alloys mainly rely on the precipitate type, size and its distribution (Frigaard et al. 2011). During FSW, the thermal condition prevails in the thermo-mechanical-affected zone (TMAZ) and heat-affected zone (HAZ) causes precipitate coarsening and dissolution of precipitates. In addition, the grain coarsening is also occurred in above said zones. Hence, these regions attain lower hardness (softening) and so termed as the lowest hardness distribution region (LHDR) (Fonda and Bingert 2006; Fu et al. 2013).|$|E
40|$|In recent past, warm forming {{processes}} {{have been}} used successfully to increase the strength of <b>age-hardenable</b> alloys by dynamic precipitation. However, the influence of dynamic age hardening on the wear and friction behaviour of <b>age-hardenable</b> aluminium alloy is not clear. Therefore, in the present investigation the effect of static and dynamic ageing on the friction and wear behaviour of aluminium 6082 alloy (AA 6082) sliding against tool steel (TS) surface has been studied. The aluminium samples {{used in the present}} study were in as-cast, solitionised and peak aged conditions. Optical microscope revealed the presence of dendritic structure in both as-cast and solitionised samples. Scanning electron microscope analysis of the debris and worn surfaces revealed the wear mechanism and role of precipitates on the friction and wear results. At low temperature (40 C), the frictional behaviour of as-cast, solitionised and peak aged samples were similar. The wear rates at 40 C increased with increase in the amount of strain inside the specimens due to fine precipitations. At 180 C, a significant variation in the frictional behaviour of different specimens was observed. The wear rate of solitionised specimens at 180 C is higher compared to as-cast and aged specimens. The absence of hard phases at initial stage of the test and subsequent dynamic precipitates restricted to a thin layer were responsible for the increase in wear rate.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of the precipitate distribution on the microstructure and on the room and high temperature mechanical properties of an <b>age-hardenable</b> aluminium AA 6082 alloy following severe straining by high-pressure torsion (HPT). With this goal, specimens in the as-cast and T 6 peak-aged conditions were processed by HPT using 0. 5, 1 and 5 turns at room temperature. At high strain levels (?> 100), similar saturation grain sizes (~ 250 nm), high-angle boundary fractions (~ 80 %) and hardness values (Hv~ 160) were obtained for both initial conditions. Grain refinement led to significant strengthening and to good ductility values at room temperature. Analysis by TEM and EDS elemental mapping revealed that HPT processing of the as-cast condition led to fracture of the stable ?-phase into many small precipitates located preferentially along grain boundaries and triple junctions. By contrast, HPT processing of the T 6 peak-aged specimens revealed a partial dissolution of the needle-shaped nanoprecipitates. The different evolutions of the precipitate distributions following straining in the as-cast and peak-aged conditions gave rise to dramatic differences in the mechanical properties and the operative deformation mechanisms at warm temperatures. These results provide evidence that the high temperature mechanical behavior of <b>age-hardenable</b> Al alloys may be conveniently controlled by altering the precipitate distribution followed by severe straining...|$|E
30|$|The <b>age-hardenable</b> {{materials}} are mainly strengthened {{due to the}} presence of fine θ’ precipitates. During loading, these precipitates act as the obstacle for the dislocation motion. The coarse stable θ precipitates cannot provide the hindrance effect due to low coherency. From the Hall-Petch relation, it was understood that the hardness or strength decreases with an increase in the grain size (Xu et al. 2012). The TMAZ micrographs exhibit coarser grains and so reduced grain boundary strengthening is observed in this region. Thus, the lower hardness of LHDR is attributed to the low grain boundary strengthening and precipitate hardening.|$|E
