5|$|The {{diploid number}} of {{chromosomes}} in the hartebeest is 40. Hybrids are usually reported from areas where ranges of two subspecies overlap. Hybrids between the Lelwel and Tora hartebeest {{have been reported}} in eastern Sudan and western Ethiopia, in a stretch southward from the Blue Nile to about 9° N latitude. A study proved a male hybrid of the red hartebeest and the blesbok (Damaliscus pygargus) to be sterile. Sterility of the hybrid was attributed to difficulties in segregation during meiosis, indicated by <b>azoospermia</b> and a low number of germ cells in its seminiferous tubules.|$|E
25|$|Many 19-nortestosterone derivatives, {{including}} nandrolone, trenbolone, ethylestrenol (ethylnandrol), metribolone (R-1881), trestolone, 11β-MNT, dimethandrolone, and others, are potent agonists of the progesterone receptor (AR) {{and hence}} are progestogens {{in addition to}} AAS. Similarly {{to the case of}} estrogenic activity, the progestogenic activity of these drugs serves to augment their antigonadotropic activity. This results in increased potency and effectiveness of these AAS as s and male contraceptives (or, put in another way, increased potency and effectiveness in producing <b>azoospermia</b> and reversible male infertility).|$|E
25|$|Examples of MAIS phenotypes include {{isolated}} infertility (oligospermia or <b>azoospermia),</b> mild gynecomastia {{in young}} adulthood, decreased secondary terminal hair, high pitched voice, or minor hypospadias repair in childhood. The external male genitalia (penis, scrotum, and urethra) are otherwise normal in individuals with MAIS. Internal genitalia, including Wolffian structures (the epididymides, vasa deferentia, and seminal vesicles) and the prostate, is also normal, although the bitesticular volume of infertile men (both {{with and without}} MAIS) is diminished; male infertility is associated with reduced bitesticular volume, varicocele, retractile testes, low ejaculate volume, male accessory gland infections (MAGI), and mumps orchitis. The incidence of these features in infertile men with MAIS {{is similar to that}} of infertile men without MAIS. MAIS is not associated with Müllerian remnants.|$|E
25|$|MAIS is only {{diagnosed}} in normal phenotypic males, {{and is not}} typically investigated except in cases of male infertility. MAIS has a mild presentation that often goes unnoticed and untreated; even with semenological, clinical and laboratory data, {{it can be difficult}} to distinguish between men with and without MAIS, and thus a diagnosis of MAIS is not usually made without confirmation of an AR gene mutation. The androgen sensitivity index (ASI), defined as the product of luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone (T), is frequently raised in individuals with all forms of AIS, including MAIS, although many individuals with MAIS have an ASI in the normal range. Testosterone levels may be elevated despite normal levels of luteinizing hormone. Conversion of testosterone (T) to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) may be impaired, although to a lesser extent than is seen in 5α-reductase deficiency. A high ASI in a normal phenotypic male, especially when combined with <b>azoospermia</b> or oligospermia, decreased secondary terminal hair, and/or impaired conversion of T to DHT, can be indicative of MAIS, and may warrant genetic testing.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{technically}} {{a variant}} of MAIS, SBMA's presentation is not typical of androgen insensitivity; symptoms do not occur until adulthood and include neuromuscular defects as well as signs of androgen inaction. Neuromuscular symptoms include progressive proximal muscle weakness, atrophy, and fasciculations. Symptoms of androgen insensitivity experienced by men with SBMA are also progressive [...] and include testicular atrophy, severe oligospermia or <b>azoospermia,</b> gynecomastia, and feminized skin changes [...] despite elevated androgen levels. Disease onset, which usually affects the proximal musculature first, occurs in the third to fifth decades of life, and is often preceded by muscular cramps on exertion, tremor of the hands, and elevated muscle creatine kinase. SBMA is often misdiagnosed as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (also known as Lou Gehrig's disease).|$|E
50|$|Pretesticular <b>azoospermia</b> is {{characterized}} by inadequate stimulation of otherwise normal testicles and genital tract. Typically, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels are low (hypogonadotropic) commensurate with inadequate stimulation of the testes to produce sperm. Examples include hypopituitarism (for various causes), hyperprolactinemia, and exogenous FSH suppression by testosterone. Chemotherapy may suppress spermatogenesis. Pretesticular <b>azoospermia</b> is seen in about 2% of <b>azoospermia.</b> Pretesticular <b>azoospermia</b> {{is a kind of}} non-obstructive <b>azoospermia.</b>|$|E
50|$|After a vasectomy, {{contraceptive}} precautions must {{be continued}} until <b>azoospermia</b> is confirmed. Usually two semen analyses at {{three and four}} months are necessary to confirm <b>azoospermia.</b> The British Andrological Society has recommended that a single semen analysis confirming <b>azoospermia</b> after sixteen weeks is sufficient.|$|E
50|$|<b>Azoospermia</b> can be {{classified}} into three major types as listed. Many conditions listed may also cause various degrees of oligospermia rather than <b>azoospermia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pre- and post-testicular <b>azoospermia</b> are {{frequently}} correctible, while testicular <b>azoospermia</b> is usually permanent. In the former {{the cause of}} the <b>azoospermia</b> needs to be considered and it opens up possibilities to manage this situation directly. Thus men with <b>azoospermia</b> due to hyperprolactinemia may resume sperm production after treatment of hyperprolactinemia or men whose sperm production is suppressed by exogenous androgens are expected to produce sperm after cessation of androgen intake. In situations where the testes are normal but unstimulated, gonadotropin therapy can be expected to induce sperm production.|$|E
50|$|Pretesticular <b>azoospermia</b> may {{be caused}} by congential hypopituitarism, Kallmann {{syndrome}}, Prader-Willi syndrome and other genetic conditions that lead to GnRH or gonadotropin deficiency.Testicular <b>azoospermia</b> is seen in Klinefelter syndrome(XXY) and the XX male syndrome. In addition, 13% of men with <b>azoospermia</b> have a defective spermatogenesis that is linked to defects of the Y chromosome. Such defects tend to be de novo micro-deletions and affect usually the long arm of the chromosome. A section of the long arm of the Y chromosome has been termed <b>Azoospermia</b> Factor (AZF) at Yq11 and subdivided into AZFa, AZFb, AZFc and possibly more subsections. Defects in this area can lead to oligospermia or <b>azoospermia,</b> however, a tight genotype-phenotype correlation has not been achieved.Spermatogenesis is defective with gene defects for the androgen receptor.|$|E
50|$|In {{men with}} posttesticular <b>azoospermia</b> {{a number of}} {{approaches}} are available. For obstructive <b>azoospermia</b> IVF-ICSI or surgery can be used and individual factors {{need to be considered}} for the choice of treatment. Medication may be helpful for retrograde ejaculation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Azoospermia</b> is {{the medical}} {{condition}} {{of a man}} whose semen contains no sperm. It is associated with infertility, but many forms are amenable to medical treatment. In humans, <b>azoospermia</b> affects about 1% of the male population and {{may be seen in}} up to 20% of male infertility situations.|$|E
50|$|Generally, {{men with}} unexplained hypergonadotropic <b>azoospermia</b> need {{to undergo a}} {{chromosomal}} evaluation.|$|E
50|$|Genetic {{factors can}} cause pretesticular, testicular, and posttesticular <b>azoospermia</b> (or oligospermia) and include the {{following}} situations: The frequency of chromosomal abnormalities is inversely proportional to the semen count, thus males with <b>azoospermia</b> are at risk to have a 10-15% (other sources citing 15-20% incidence) abnormalities on karyotyping versus about <1 % in the fertile male population.|$|E
50|$|Deleted in <b>azoospermia</b> protein 2 is {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the DAZ2 gene.|$|E
50|$|Couples who are {{infertile}} {{secondary to}} non-obstructive <b>azoospermia</b> and concurrent varicocele, {{may benefit from}} microsurgical testicular sperm extraction (microTESE).|$|E
50|$|DBCP {{causes a}} {{dramatic}} decrease in male fertility, ranging from oligospermia (low sperm count) to <b>azoospermia</b> (lack of sperm).|$|E
50|$|Some {{studies have}} shown that {{letrozole}} can be used to promote spermatogenesis in male patients suffering from nonobstructive <b>azoospermia.</b>|$|E

50|$|In posttesticular <b>azoospermia</b> sperm are {{produced}} but not ejaculated, {{a condition that}} affects 7-51% of azoospermic men. The main cause is a physical obstruction (obstructive <b>azoospermia)</b> of the posttesticular genital tracts. The most common reason is a vasectomy done to induce contraceptive sterility. Other obstructions can be congenital (example agenesis of the vas deferens as seen in certain cases of cystic fibrosis) or acquired, such as ejaculatory duct obstruction for instance by infection.|$|E
50|$|Human {{embryonic}} stem cells have been stimulated to form Spermatozoon-like cells, yet still slightly damaged or malformed. It could potentially treat <b>azoospermia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Idiopathic <b>azoospermia</b> {{is where}} there is no known cause of the condition. It may be a result of {{multiple}} risk factors, such as age and weight. For example, a review in 2013 came to the result that oligospermia and <b>azoospermia</b> are significantly associated with being overweight (odds ratio 1.1), obese (odds ratio 1.3) and morbidly obese (odds ratio 2.0), but the cause of this is unknown. The review found no significant relation between oligospermia and being underweight.|$|E
50|$|Causes for {{testicular}} failure include congenital {{issues such}} as in certain genetic conditions (e.g. Klinefelter syndrome), some cases of cryptorchidism or Sertoli cell-only syndrome as well as acquired conditions by infection (orchitis), surgery (trauma, cancer), radiation, or other causes. Mast cells releasing inflammatory mediators appear to directly suppress sperm motility in a potentially reversible manner, and may be a common pathophysiological mechanism for many causes leading to inflammation.

50|$|A major {{advancement}} {{in recent years}} has been the introduction of IVF with ICSI which allows successful fertilization even with immature sperm or sperm obtained directly from testicular tissue. IVF-ICSI allows for pregnancy in couples where the man has irreversible testicular <b>azoospermia</b> as long as it is possible to recover sperm material from the testes. Thus men with non-mosaic Klinefelter's syndrome have fathered children using IVF-ICSI. Pregnancies have been achieved in situations where <b>azoospermia</b> was associated with cryptorchism and sperm where obtained by testicular sperm extraction (TESE).|$|E
50|$|Aspermia is the {{complete}} lack of semen with ejaculation (not {{to be confused with}} <b>azoospermia,</b> the lack of sperm cells in the semen). It is associated with infertility.|$|E

50|$|Inhibin B {{may be used}} as {{a marker}} of {{spermatogenesis}} function and male infertility. The mean serum inhibin B level is significantly higher among fertile men (approximately 140 pg/mL) than in infertile men (approximately 80 pg/mL). In men with <b>azoospermia,</b> a positive test for inhibin B slightly raises the chances for successfully achieving pregnancy through testicular sperm extraction (TESE), although the association is not very substantial, having a sensitivity of 0.65 (95% confidence interval CI: 0.56-0.74) and a specificity of 0.83 (CI: 0.64-0.93) for prediction the presence of sperm in the testes in non-obstructive <b>azoospermia.</b>|$|E
