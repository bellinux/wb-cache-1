5|$|Astronomers {{calculate}} the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> by {{assuming that the}} Lambda-CDM model accurately describes {{the evolution of the}} Universe from a very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its present state and measuring the cosmological parameters which constitute the model. This model is well understood theoretically and supported by recent high-precision astronomical observations such as WMAP and Planck. Commonly, the set of observations fitted includes the cosmic microwave background anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, and large-scale galaxy clustering including the baryon acoustic oscillation feature. Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance of galaxy clusters, weak gravitational lensing and globular cluster ages, are generally consistent with these, providing a check of the model, but are less accurately measured at present. With the prior that the Lambda-CDM model is correct, the measurements of the parameters using a variety of techniques by numerous experiments yield a best value of the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> as of 2015 of 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years.|$|E

5|$|If {{the mass}} of a main-sequence star is lower than {{approximately}} half a solar mass, it will never become hot enough to fuse helium in its core.

5|$|In the mid-1990s, {{observations}} of certain globular clusters appeared to indicate, {{that they were}} about 15billion years old, which conflicted with most then-current estimates of the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> (and indeed with the age measured today). This issue was later resolved when new computer simulations, which included the effects of mass loss due to stellar winds, indicated a much younger age for globular clusters. While there still remain some questions as to how accurately {{the ages of the}} clusters are measured, globular clusters are of interest to cosmology as some of the oldest objects in the universe.|$|E
5|$|A {{white dwarf}} is very hot when it forms, {{but because it}} has no source of energy, it will {{gradually}} radiate its energy and cool. This means that its radiation, which initially has a high color temperature, will lessen and redden with time. Over a very long time, a white dwarf will cool and its material will begin to crystallize (starting with the core). The star's low temperature means it will no longer emit significant heat or light, and {{it will become a}} cold black dwarf. Because the length of time it takes for a white dwarf to reach this state is calculated to be longer than the current <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> (approximately 13.8 billion years), it is thought that no black dwarfs yet exist. The oldest white dwarfs still radiate at temperatures of a few thousand kelvins.|$|E
5|$|Natural thorium {{is usually}} almost pure 232Th, {{which is the}} longest-lived and most stable isotope of thorium, having a {{half-life}} comparable to the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b> Its radioactive decay is the largest single contributor to the Earth's internal heat; the other major contributors are the shorter-lived primordial radionuclides, which are 238U, 40K, and 235U in descending order of their contribution. (At {{the time of the}} Earth's formation, 40K and 235U contributed much more by virtue of their short half-lives, but they have decayed more quickly, leaving the contribution from 232Th and 238U predominant.) The other natural thorium isotopes are much shorter-lived; of them, only 230Th is usually detectable, occurring in secular equilibrium with its parent 238U, and making up at most 0.04% of natural thorium.|$|E

5|$|Rubidium-87 has a {{half-life}} of years, {{which is}} {{more than three times the}} <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> of years, making it a primordial nuclide. It readily substitutes for potassium in minerals, and is therefore fairly widespread. Rb has been used extensively in dating rocks; 87Rb beta decays to stable 87Sr. During fractional crystallization, Sr tends to concentrate in plagioclase, leaving Rb in the liquid phase. Hence, the Rb/Sr ratio in residual magma may increase over time, and the progressing differentiation results in rocks with elevated Rb/Sr ratios. The highest ratios (10 or more) occur in pegmatites. If the initial amount of Sr is known or can be extrapolated, then the age can be determined by measurement of the Rb and Sr concentrations and of the 87Sr/86Sr ratio. The dates indicate the true age of the minerals only if the rocks have not been subsequently altered (see rubidium–strontium dating).|$|E
5|$|All but two {{elements}} up to bismuth (element 83) have an isotope that is practically stable for all purposes ("classically stable"), with the exceptions being technetium and promethium (elements 43 and 61). All elements from polonium (element 84) onward are measurably radioactive. 232Th {{is one of}} the three nuclides beyond bismuth (the other two being 235U and 238U) that have half-lives measured in billions of years; its half-life is 14.05billionyears, about three times the age of the earth, and slightly longer than the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b> Four-fifths of the thorium present at Earth's formation has survived to the present. 232Th is the only isotope of thorium occurring in quantity in nature, and thorium is usually considered to be a mononuclidic element. Its stability is attributed to its closed nuclear shell with 142 neutrons. Thorium has a characteristic terrestrial isotopic composition, with atomic weight 232.0377(4). It is one of only three radioactive elements (along with protactinium and uranium) that occur in large enough quantities on Earth for this to be possible.|$|E

The chance of this reaction producing 295Ts is estimated to be, at most, one-seventh the chance of producing 294Ts. Calculations using a quantum tunneling model predict the existence of several isotopes of tennessine up to 303Ts. The most stable of these is expected to be 296Ts with an alpha-decay half-life of 40milliseconds. A liquid drop model study on the element's isotopes shows similar results; it suggests a general trend of increasing stability for isotopes heavier than 301Ts, with partial half-lives exceeding the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> for the heaviest isotopes like 335Ts when beta decay is not considered.

5|$|The Big Bang {{theory is}} the {{prevailing}} cosmological {{model for the}} universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model describes how the universe expanded from a very high density and high temperature state, and offers a comprehensive explanation for {{a broad range of}} phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), large scale structure and Hubble's law. If the known laws of physics are extrapolated to the highest density regime, the result is a singularity which is typically associated with the Big Bang. Physicists are undecided whether this means the universe began from a singularity, or that current knowledge is insufficient to describe the universe at that time. Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the Big Bang at around 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b> After the initial expansion, the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles, and later simple atoms. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity in halos of dark matter, eventually forming the stars and galaxies visible today.|$|E
25|$|It {{was long}} thought that q was positive, {{indicating}} that the expansion is slowing down due to gravitational attraction.

For instance, a value for q of 1/2 (once favoured by most theorists) would give the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> as 2/(3H). The discovery in 1998 that q is apparently negative means that the Universe could actually be older than 1/H.

25|$|The {{first phase}} change <b>of</b> {{hydrogen}} in <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> was recombination, which {{occurred at a}} redshift z=1089 (379,000 years after the Big Bang), due to <b>the</b> cooling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> to <b>the</b> point where <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> recombination of electrons and protons to form neutral hydrogen was higher than the reionization rate. <b>The</b> <b>universe</b> was opaque before the recombination, due to <b>the</b> scattering <b>of</b> photons (of all wavelengths) off free electrons (and, to a significantly lesser extent, free protons), but it became increasingly transparent as more electrons and protons combined to form neutral hydrogen atoms. While <b>the</b> electrons <b>of</b> neutral hydrogen can absorb photons of some wavelengths by rising to an excited state, a universe full of neutral hydrogen will be relatively opaque only at those absorbed wavelengths, but transparent throughout most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spectrum. <b>The</b> Dark <b>Ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> start at that point, {{because there were no}} light sources other than the gradually redshifting cosmic background radiation.|$|R
