40|$|Despite {{efforts to}} improve {{chemotherapeutic}} efficacy in epithelial ovarian cancer, outcome for patients with advanced disease has remained unchanged since the introduction of standard carboplatin and paclitaxel. Interest has therefore shifted toward molecularly targeted therapies that interfere with important features of ovarian carcinogenesis, such as <b>angiogenesis.</b> Several <b>angiogenesis</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) ligands (bevacizumab, VEGF-Trap) or their receptors (VEGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors) have been clinically evaluated. These agents demonstrated efficacy in phase II clinical trials. Results from phase III trials, in which bevacizumab was added to standard frontline chemotherapy, show a modest effect. Although the initial expectations for <b>angiogenesis</b> <b>inhibitors</b> have been tempered, further research is warranted to define their precise place {{in the treatment of}} ovarian cancer. This review summarizes the performed and ongoing studies with regard to <b>angiogenesis</b> <b>inhibitors</b> in ovarian cancer, and the available data on biomarkers for response prediction. Preclinical studies evaluating alternative <b>angiogenesis</b> <b>inhibitors</b> will also be discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Currently, the {{standard}} treatment for newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is maximal safe surgical resection followed by radiation therapy with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide. However, disease recurs {{in almost all}} patients, and the optimal salvage treatment for recurrent GBM remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published clinical trials to assess the efficacy and toxicities of <b>angiogenesis</b> <b>inhibitors</b> alone as salvage treatment in these patients. Trials published between 1994 and 2015 were identified by an electronic search of public databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library). Demographic data, treatment regimens, objective response rate (ORR), median progression-free survival (PFS), median overall survival (OS), 6 -months PFS rate, 1 -year OS and grade 3 / 4 toxicities were extracted. We also compared the main outcomes of interest between bevacizumab and other <b>angiogenesis</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> All analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta Analysis software (Version 2. 0). A total of 842 patients were included for analysis: 343 patients were treated with bevacizumab, 386 with other <b>angiogenesis</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and 81 with thalidomide. The pooled ORR, 6 -months PFS, and 1 -year OS for recurrent GBM patients receiving <b>angiogenesis</b> <b>inhibitors</b> was 20. 1 %, 19. 5 % and 29. 3 %, respectively. The use of single agent bevacizumab in recurrent GBM significantly improved ORR and 6 -months PFS {{when compared to other}} <b>angiogenesis</b> <b>inhibitors</b> [relative risk (RR) 2. 93, 95 % CI 1. 38 - 6. 21; p = 0. 025; and RR 2. 36 95 % CI 1. 46 - 3. 82; p< 0. 001, respectively], while no significant difference in 1 -year OS was found between the two groups (p = 0. 07). when compared to thalidomide, bevacizumab treatment in recurrent GBM significantly improved ORR (RR 6. 8, 95 %CI: 2. 64 - 17. 6, p< 0. 001), but not for 6 -months PFS (p = 0. 07) and 1 -year OS (p = 0. 31). As for grade 3 / 4 toxicities, the common toxicity was hypertension with pooled incidence of 12. 1 %, while high-grade thromboembolic events (2. 2 %), hemorrhage (5. 1 %) and GI perforation (2. 8 %) associated with <b>angiogenesis</b> <b>inhibitors</b> were relatively low. In comparison with other <b>angiogenesis</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and thalidomide, the use of single agent bevacizumab as salvage treatment for recurrent GBM patients improve ORR and 6 -months PFS, but not for 1 -year OS...|$|R
50|$|Various <b>angiogenesis</b> <b>inhibitors</b> {{have been}} {{developed}} to interfere with different steps in the process. Bevacizumab (Avastin) is a monoclonal antibody that binds to VEGF, preventing the stimulation of the VEGF receptor. Sorafenib and sutinib are additional <b>angiogenesis</b> <b>inhibitors</b> that bind and block receptors on endothelial cells that have important roles in downstream pathways contributing to angiogenesis progression. An extensive amount of other compounds targeted towards halting angiogenesis are either currently in preclinical development, undergoing clinical trials, or in the process of getting approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration.|$|R
