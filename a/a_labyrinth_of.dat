5|$|Pym and Peters {{hide in the}} {{mountains}} surrounding {{the site of the}} ambush. They discover <b>a</b> <b>labyrinth</b> <b>of</b> passages in the hills with strange marks on the walls, and disagree about whether these are the result of artificial or natural causes. Facing a shortage of food, they make a desperate run and steal a pirogue from the natives, narrowly escaping from the island and taking one of its inhabitants prisoner.|$|E
5|$|In the {{earliest}} days of the Vietnam War, North Vietnam supplied the Viet Cong in the South by two methods. The first was to extend the Ho Chi Minh Trail southward into the tri-border region of Laos/Cambodia/South Vietnam. The Trail, <b>a</b> <b>labyrinth</b> <b>of</b> paths, roads, river transportation systems and way-stations, was constantly being expanded and improved. It served as a logistical jugular vein, for both men and material, for the North Vietnamese war effort against South Vietnam. The second method was to transport supplies by sea.|$|E
5|$|It was a {{daunting}} challenge. The Ho Chi Minh Trail (controlled by the 259th PAVN Logistical Group) consisted of <b>a</b> <b>labyrinth</b> <b>of</b> dirt roads, bicycle and foot paths, bypasses, storage areas, workshops, and truck parks that stretched {{from the mountain}} passes of North Vietnam, through the panhandle of Laos, and into east central Cambodia. The entire system was elaborately camouflaged from aerial observation and was constantly being maintained, expanded, and improved. By 1968 PAVN was relying less on manual labor and increasingly utilizing modern construction equipment. The CIA estimated during the year the 259th Group was using 20 bulldozers, eleven road graders, three rock crushers and two steamrollers on the network. Manual labor was still provided by an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 Laotians (mostly pressed into service) and North Vietnamese volunteers.|$|E

25|$|The {{centre of}} Vila do Corvo, {{situated}} {{in the eastern part}} of the Rua da Matriz and characterized by a group of narrow roads, alleyways and <b>a</b> <b>labyrinth</b> <b>of</b> buildings, is the historic town. The buildings are generally two-storey constructions, oriented towards the south and roofed in tile. Some of these buildings continue to have spaces for pig-pens, corrals and annexes aligned to the alleyways.|$|E
25|$|All this {{tends to}} characterise “L’Adone” as <b>a</b> <b>labyrinth</b> <b>of</b> {{entangled}} situations without any real structure. The lengthy Canto XX, {{which takes place}} after the protagonist's death, serves to undermine any pretence to narrative unity. But this very lack of unity constitutes Marino's narrative innovation. The poet composes his work using various levels and passes from one episode to the next without any apparent logical connection, basing the links solely on a language rich in hyperboles, antitheses and metaphors.|$|E

25|$|Soon after Bacon, the {{influential}} work of Pseudo-Geber (sometimes identified as Paul of Taranto) appeared. His Summa Perfectionis remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods. It was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur-mercury theory, and the unusual clarity {{with which they}} were described. By the end of the 13th century, alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief. Adepts believed in the macrocosm-microcosm theories of Hermes, that is to say, they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could {{have an effect on the}} human body (for example, if one could learn the secret of purifying gold, one could use the technique to purify the human soul). They believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above, and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in <b>a</b> <b>labyrinth</b> <b>of</b> coded jargon set with traps to mislead the uninitiated. Finally, the alchemists practiced their art: they actively experimented with chemicals and made observations and theories about how the universe operated. Their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man's soul was divided within himself after the fall of Adam. By purifying the two parts of man's soul, man could be reunited with God.|$|E

500|$|While he lived, Stephen Crane was {{denominated}} by critical readers a realist, a naturalist, an impressionist, symbolist, Symboliste, expressionist and ironist; his posthumous {{life was}} enriched by critics who read him as nihilistic, existentialist, a neo-Romantic, a sentimentalist, protomodernist, pointilliste, visionist, imagist and, by {{his most recent}} biographer, a “bleak naturalist.” At midcentury he was a “predisciple of the New Criticism”; by its end he was “a proto-deconstructionist anti-artist hero” who had “leapfrogged modernism, landing on postmodernist ground.” Or, as Sergio Perosa wrote in 1964, “The critic wanders in <b>a</b> <b>labyrinth</b> <b>of</b> possibilities, which every new turn taken by Crane’s fiction seems to explode or deny.” ...|$|E

They were used as a residence during hot weather months, as they were cooled by effective ventilation systems that channeled cool breezes into the palace. The palace's flooring system also helped cool the space - its floors were made of two layers that were separated by a layer of water pumped in from the Ravi River. Cool water perfumed by roses flowed through an elaborate system of 42 waterfalls and cascades throughout the palace.|$|E
500|$|Scholars have {{compared}} The Tombs of Atuan to The Beginning Place, another of Le Guin's fantasy works; both stories have a female protagonist guiding a blundering male through <b>a</b> <b>labyrinth</b> <b>of</b> sorts. Comparisons {{have been made}} to a number of Le Guin's works which have a notion of a dream world in which the protagonists undergo a transformation; in The Tombs of Atuan, this is the labyrinth. Ged's journey through the series has been compared to the traditional heroic quest, including a [...] "descent into the underworld" [...] represented by the labyrinth in The Tombs of Atuan.
