25|$|At {{the turn}} of the 21st century, Indian {{political}} circles started to take a serious look at Bangladeshi illegal immigration into India. Bangladesh is under pressure from India as a source of rebellion in Indian North-East for this Indian perception. It is also hard pressed to convince India that encouraging migration is not a state policy of Bangladesh. The state of Bangladesh denied the existence of these immigrants while stripping them of their Bangladeshi citizenship. According to Jyoti M. Pathania of South Asia <b>Analysis</b> <b>Group</b> the reasons for Bangladeshi immigration to India are: basic need theory i.e. food, shelter and clothing, economic dictates i.e. employment opportunity, better wages and comparatively better living conditions, demographic disproportion especially for minorities (Hindus) in this densely populated country having roughly a density of 780 per km2 as against half that number on Indian side of the border, and being cheap labor the Bangladeshis find easy acceptance as “domestic helps” in Indian homes, which keeps proliferating by ever increasing demand for domestic helps. The Centre for Women and Children Studies estimated in 1998 that 27,000 Bangladeshis have been forced into prostitution in India.|$|E

500|$|According to Stemmle, the {{cancellation}} decision {{was prompted by}} the report of an external marketing <b>analysis</b> <b>group</b> hired by LucasArts, which claimed that the European market for adventure games [...] "had simply disappeared. Not shrunk, not cratered, just... disappeared". A newly established German company, Bad Brain Entertainment, claimed to have entered negotiations with LucasArts to acquire the game, although nothing resulted from these talks. LucasArts subsequently dismissed many of the designers involved with developing their adventure games, and in 2006 stated {{that they did not}} intend to return to the adventure genre until the next decade. Some of the former Freelance Police development team formed Telltale Games in June 2004 to continue developing the sort of adventure games that LucasArts no longer wished to produce. Telltale Games later unsuccessfully attempted to buy the rights to Freelance Police from LucasArts, which would have enabled the team to finish developing the game. When the LucasArts license expired in mid-2005, Purcell took the franchise to Telltale Games, where it was developed into an episodic series of games. However, very little of the work done on Freelance Police was carried over by the developers to Telltale Games; LucasArts still held onto the game's assets and Telltale was wary about using similar design patterns. The new series debuted in October 2006 with Sam & Max Save the World.|$|E

[...] The conical/cylindrical transition piece at frame 67 followed instantly. [...] The ship was broken in two by massive hydrostatic pressure at an estimated depth of [...] The operations compartment was largely obliterated by sea pressure, and the engine room had telescoped [...] forward into the hull due to collapse pressure, when the cone-to-cylinder transition junction failed between the auxiliary machine space and the engine room.|$|E
