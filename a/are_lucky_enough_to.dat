If the death has {{occurred}} elsewhere, salvation can be achieved by immersing the ashes in the Ganges. If the ashes have been immersed in another body of water, a relative can still gain salvation for the deceased by journeying to the Ganges, if possible during the lunar [...] "fortnight of the ancestors" [...] in the Hindu calendar month of Ashwin (September or October), and performing the Shraddha rites.|$|E

2500|$|During an {{interview}} with Abrams to promote 10 Cloverfield Lane, he said the creative team behind the original had some ideas on developing Cloverfield 2, but the release of movies such as Godzilla and Pacific Rim led them to abandon them as they found the concept of Kaiju movies played out. However, Abrams also suggested that he has thought of something that if they <b>are</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> get it made [...] "could be really cool that [...] connects some stories" [...] in a future film, even teasing a larger Cloverfield universe. Interviews with Dan Trachtenberg and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, director and actress of 10 Cloverfield Lane, respectively, confirm that the movie is, and always was intended to be, {{an expansion of the}} first film, with Trachtenberg calling it the [...] "Cloververse".|$|E
2500|$|At {{least four}} veined octopus (Amphioctopus marginatus) {{individuals}} were witnessed retrieving coconut shells, manipulating them, stacking them, transporting them some distance (up to 20 metres), and then reassembling {{them to use}} as a shelter. The octopuses use coconut shells discarded by humans which have eventually settled in the ocean. They probe their arms down to loosen the mud, then rotate the shells out. After turning the shells so the open side faces upwards, the octopuses blow jets of mud out of the bowl before extending their arms around the shell—or if they have two halves, stacking them first, one inside the other. They then stiffen their legs and move away in a manner which has been called [...] "stilt-walking". The octopuses eventually use the shells as a protective shelter in areas where little other shelter exists. If they just have one half, they simply turn it over and hide underneath. But if they <b>are</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> have retrieved two halves, they assemble them back into the original closed coconut form and sneak inside. This behaviour [...] The authors of the research article claimed this behaviour falls under the definition of tool use because the shells are carried for later use. However, this argument remains contested by a number of other biologists who state that the shells actually provide continuous protection from abundant bottom-dwelling predators in their home range.|$|E

That is almost a day's wages. I remember when wages were sixty cents a day for laborers on this very road.
