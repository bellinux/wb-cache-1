40|$|Cosmetic {{treatment}} with botulinum toxin type A injections {{is the top}} non-surgical cosmetic procedure in the U. S. Many patients are beginning treatment <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>age</b> to prevent the development of facial wrinkles associated with aging. However, there is limited data to {{support the use of}} prophylactic botulinum toxin injections. Patients beginning treatment <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>age</b> have fewer wrinkles requiring fewer units to treat, which reduces the overall cost of treatment. Patients also maintain higher levels of self- esteem by preventing or delaying the onset of facial wrinkles that can negatively impact their appearance. This study proposes that patients receiving botulinum toxin injections <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>age</b> (< 35) will have higher satisfaction with treatment outcomes. By demonstrating an association between starting age of injections and patient satisfaction, this study aims to provide merit for clinical trials studying the effectiveness of prophylactic botulinum toxin injections for cosmetic indications...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT- Background: Only {{few studies}} have {{examined}} the impact of racial differences on the age of onset, course and outcomes of diverticulitis. Aim: To provide data about the epidemiology of diverticulitis in northern Israel, and to determine whether ethnicity is a predictor of age of onset, complications, and need for surgery. Methods: Was conducted a retrospective review of the charts of all patients diagnosed with a first episode of diverticulitis in our hospital between 2005 and 2012. Results: Were found 638 patients with a first episode of acute diverticulitis in the eight year interval. Israeli Arabs developed a first episode of diverticulitis <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>age</b> compared to Jews (51. 2 vs 63. 8 years, p< 0. 01). Arabs living in rural areas developed diverticulitis <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>age</b> than Arabs living in urban centers (49. 4 vs 54. 5 years, P= 0. 03). Jewish and Arabic men developed diverticulitis at <b>younger</b> <b>age</b> compared to their female counterparts (59. 9 vs 66. 09, p< 0. 01, and 47. 31 vs 56. 93, p< 0. 01, respectively). Arabs were more likely [odds ratio (OR) = 1. 81, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 12 - 2. 90, p= 0. 017] than Jews to require surgical treatment (urgent or elective) for diverticulitis. Conclusions: Israeli Arabs tend to develop diverticulitis <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>age</b> {{and are more likely to}} require surgical treatment for diverticulitis compared to Jews. Arabs living in rural areas develop diverticulitis <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>age</b> than Arabs living in urban centers. These findings highlight a need t...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity {{disorder}} (ADHD) {{has been}} associated with dopaminergic imbalance and subtle volume decreases in the brain. Stimulants acutely enhance dopaminergic neurotransmission. Long-term effects of prolonged manipulation of the dopaminergic system on brain structure remain poorly understood; they could be beneficial or unfavorable and could be moderated by common genetic variants and/or age. Method: In a large observational ADHD cohort study (N = 316), the effects of cumulative stimulant treatment, genotype (for DAT 1 haplotype and DRD 4 variants), and treatment-by-genotype interactions on striatal, frontal, and hippocampal volumes and their interactions with age were evaluated. Results: No main effects of treatment were found. Associations between treatment and bilateral frontal and left hippocampal volume depended on DRD 4 genotype and <b>age.</b> <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>age</b> and lower treatment levels, but not <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>age</b> and higher treatment levels, carriers of the DRD 4 7 R allele showed decreased frontal cortex volumes. <b>At</b> <b>an</b> older age, carriers and non-carriers showed smaller frontal volumes irrespective of treatment history. Left hippocampal volume was similar to that in controls at average treatment levels and increased with treatment only in carriers of the DRD 4 risk allele and <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>age.</b> No interaction effects were found in the striatum. Conclusion: Carriers of the DRD 4 risk allele <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>age</b> might be sensitive to cortical remodeling after stimulant treatment. The cross-sectional nature of this study warrants cautious interpretation of age effects. The present findings, although of small effect size, might ultimately contribute to optimal care for individuals with ADHD...|$|R
