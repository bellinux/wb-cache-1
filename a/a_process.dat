5|$|The newly hatched {{young of}} oviparous fish are called larvae.

The larval period in oviparous fish is relatively short (usually only several weeks), and larvae rapidly grow and change appearance and structure (<b>a</b> <b>process</b> termed metamorphosis) to become juveniles. During this transition larvae must switch from their yolk sac to feeding on zooplankton prey, <b>a</b> <b>process</b> which depends on typically inadequate zooplankton density, starving many larvae.|$|E
