5000|$|Given {{the fact}} that {{magnetic}} flux leakage is a vector quantity and that a hall sensor can only measure in one direction, three sensors must be oriented within a sensor head to accurately measure the axial, [...] and circumferential components of an MFL signal. The <b>axial</b> <b>component</b> of the vector signal is measured by a sensor mounted orthogonal to the axis of the pipe, and the radial sensor is mounted to measure {{the strength of the}} flux that leaks out of the pipe. The circumferential component of the vector signal can be measured by mounting a sensor perpendicular to this field. Earlier MFL tools recorded only the <b>axial</b> <b>component</b> but high-resolution tools typically measure all three components. To determine if metal loss is occurring on the internal or external surface of a pipe, a separate eddy current sensor is utilized to indicate wall surface location of the anomaly. The unit of measure when sensing an MFL signal is the gauss or the tesla and generally speaking, the larger the change in the detected magnetic field, the larger the anomaly.|$|E

50|$|A conical {{rotor brake}} motor {{incorporates}} the brake {{as an integral}} part of the conical sliding rotor. When the motor is at rest, a spring acts on the sliding rotor and forces the brake ring against the brake cap in the motor, holding the rotor stationary. When the motor is energized, its magnetic field generates both an axial and a radial component. The <b>axial</b> <b>component</b> overcomes the spring force, releasing the brake; while the radial component causes the rotor to turn. There is no additional brake control required.|$|E
5000|$|Radial leads project {{more or less}} in {{parallel}} from the same surface or aspect of a component package, rather than from opposite ends of the package. Originally, radial leads were defined as more-or-less following a radius of a cylindrical component (such as a ceramic disk capacitor). [...] Over time, this definition was generalized in contrast to axial leads, and took on its current form. When placed on a board, radial components [...] "stand up" [...] perpendicular, occupying a smaller footprint on sometimes-scarce [...] "board real estate", making them useful in many high-density designs. The parallel leads projecting from a single mounting surface gives radial components an overall [...] "plugin-nature", facilitating their use in high-speed automated component insertion ("board-stuffing") machines.When needed, an <b>axial</b> <b>component</b> can be effectively converted into a radial component, by bending one of its leads into a [...] "U" [...] shape so that it ends up close to and parallel with the other lead. Extra insulation with heat-shrink tubing may be used to prevent shorting out on nearby components. Conversely, a radial component can be pressed into service as an <b>axial</b> <b>component</b> by separating its leads as far as possible, and extending them into an overall length-spanning shape. These improvisations are often seen in breadboard or prototype construction, but are deprecated for mass production designs. This is because of difficulties in use with automated component placement machinery, and poorer reliability because of reduced vibration and mechanical shock resistance in the completed assembly.|$|E

Note that swirl is usually referenced to full body rotation (that which the full pipeline flow follows one axis of swirl).

50|$|Electrons {{emitted from}} the cathode possess very low energy, {{only a few}} eV. To give them the {{required}} high speed, they are accelerated by a strong electric field applied between the emitter and another, positively charged, electrode, namely the anode. The accelerating field must also navigate the electrons to form a narrow converging “bundle” around the axis. This {{can be achieved by}} an electric field in the proximity of the emitting cathode surface which has, a radial addition as well as an <b>axial</b> <b>component,</b> forcing the electrons {{in the direction of the}} axis.

D describes the <b>axial</b> <b>component</b> of the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction, and E the transversal component. Values of D have been obtained for a wide number of organic biradicals by EPR measurements. This value may be measured by other magnetometry techniques such as SQUID; however, EPR measurements provide more accurate data in most cases. This value can also be obtained with other techniques such as optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR; a double resonance technique which combines EPR with measurements such as fluorescence, phosphorescence and absorption), with sensitivity down to a single molecule or defect in solids like Diamond (e.g. N-V center) or Silicon Carbide.|$|E
50|$|The {{focusing}} {{effect of}} a rotationally symmetrical magnetic field on the trajectory of electrons {{is the result of}} the complicated influence of a magnetic field on a moving electron. This effect is a force proportional to the induction B of the field and electron velocity v. The vector product of the radial component of induction Br and <b>axial</b> <b>component</b> of velocity va is a force perpendicular to those vectors, causing the electron to move around the axis. Additional effect of this motion in the same magnetic field is another force F oriented radially to the axis, which is responsible for the focusing effect of the magnetic lens. The resulting trajectory of electrons in the magnetic lens is a curve similar to a helix. In this context it should be mentioned that variations of focal length (exciting current) cause a slight rotation of the beam cross-section.|$|E

5000|$|There {{is a lot}} of {{variation}} between different versions of BEM theory. First, one can consider the effect of wake rotation or not. Second, one can go further and consider the pressure drop induced in wake rotation. Third, the tangential induction factors can be solved with a momentum equation, an energy balance or orthogonal geometric constraint; the latter a result of Biot-Savart law in vortex methods. These all lead to different set of equations that need to be solved. The simplest and most widely used equations are those that consider wake rotation with the momentum equation but ignore the pressure drop from wake rotation. Those equations are given below. a is the <b>axial</b> <b>component</b> of the induced flow, a' is the tangential component of the induced flow.

5000|$|Any {{change of}} the <b>axial</b> <b>component</b> of the {{atmospheric}} angular momentum (AAM) {{must be accompanied by}} a corresponding {{change of the}} angular momentum of Earth's crust and mantle (due to the law of conservation of angular momentum). Because the moment of inertia of the system mantle-crust is only slightly influenced by atmospheric pressure loading, this mainly requires a change in the angular velocity of the solid Earth; i.e., a change of LOD. The LOD can presently be measured to a high accuracy over integration times of only a few hours, and general circulation models of the atmosphere allow high precision determination of changes in AAM in the model. [...] A comparison between AAM and LOD shows that they are highly correlated. In particular, one recognizes an annual period of LOD with an amplitude of 0.34 milliseconds, maximizing on February 3, and a semiannual period with an amplitude of 0.29 milliseconds, maximizing on May 8, as well as 10‑day fluctuations of the order of 0.1 milliseconds. Interseasonal fluctuations reflecting El Niño events and quasi-biennial oscillations have also been observed. [...] There is now general agreement that most of the changes in LOD on time scales from weeks to a few years are excited by changes in AAM.|$|E

Constitutive equation of upper convected Maxwell model {{is used for the}} non-Newtonian rheology. The governing equations are modeled for axisymmetric flow. A regular perturbation method is used for the radial and <b>axial</b> velocity <b>components</b> up to second order in dimensionless amplitude. Exact expressions for the first-order radial and <b>axial</b> velocity <b>components</b> are readily obtained while second-order mean <b>axial</b> velocity <b>component</b> is obtained numerically due to presence of complicated non-homogenous term in the corresponding equation.

Effects of various emerging parameters on the net flow rate are discussed through graphical illustrations. It is observed that the net flow rate is positive for larger values of dimensionless relaxation time λ 1. This result is contrary to that of reported by [D. Tsiklauri and I.
