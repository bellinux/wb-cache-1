40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} {{problems}} of healthcare-associated infection in selected nursing activities. The thesis is a theoretical one; {{it has been}} processed by means of review and synthesis. In this thesis, four objectives were set, namely to create a comprehensive overview {{of the problems of}} healthcare-associated infection in selected nursing activities. Other objectives were to map and analyze clinically relevant sites of transmission and possibilities of prevention of healthcare-associated infection in selected nursing activities and to propose recommendations for the prevention of these infections. The thesis is divided into several chapters that deal with the characteristics of healthcare-associated infection, focusing on the causative agents, formation, spreading and prevention. It also deals with particular nursing activities. The first chosen activity was the care of medical devices intended for repeated use, with a particular focus on the implementation of their disinfection. Secondly, hand sanitation as a basic factor affecting the transmission of healthcare-associated infection activity was selected. This chapter deals primarily with the hygienic hand disinfection, its indications, methods and implementation of disinfection products. It also deals with strategies for improving hand hygiene and glove use in providing nursing care. As the third nursing activity, aseptic techniques, which are an essential part in providing nursing care, were chosen. The thesis describes three specific clinical nursing procedures: aseptic collection of venous blood from a peripheral vein, preparation and administration of a drug into an existing peripheral venous catheter, and uncomplicated (<b>aseptic)</b> wounds dressing. <b>Processing</b> of the thesis was based on a range of relevant sources from the Czech Republic but also from abroad. It also contains various recommendations of national and international institutions.

A second option is to have the pre-assembled tubes delivered to the packager for completion and filling. These are suited for <b>aseptic</b> <b>processing</b> and are used for milk, soup, juice, etc.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} other devices, which can offer some helpful separation. These devices {{are known as}} Gloveboxes. Gloveboxes do not offer the separative control {{provisions}} of an isolator or RABS. Gloveboxes were originally designed for non-sterile product applications, such as weighing or manipulating a toxic drug and have a long track record for such non-sterile applications. Such gloveboxes can be very effective in preventing exposure of an operator to a toxic drug. In limited cases, {{they can also be}} used to protect a sterile product, when supplied with ISO 5 unidirectional air. However, in some notable cases, gloveboxes used for <b>aseptic</b> <b>processing</b> have provided no more sterile product protection than the traditional laminar air flow hood (LAF) design of the 1960s. In these cases, the glove boxes were problematic due to inappropriate design or controls (e.g., insufficient disinfection, transfer of contaminated materials, ingress of lower quality air into glovebox, poor design/integrity, poor transfers). However, if gloveboxes are very meticulously designed, thoroughly disinfected (e.g., using a sporadic) and carefully operated by well-trained <b>aseptic</b> <b>processing</b> personnel to prevent introduction of microbial contamination, it is possible to obtain some degree of increased sterile product protection versus the simple traditional LAF hood.|$|E

50|$|Apple {{juice is}} a fruit juice {{made by the}} {{maceration}} and pressing of an apple. The resulting expelled juice may be further treated by enzymatic and centrifugal clarification to remove the starch and pectin, which holds fine particulate in suspension, and then pasteurized for packaging in glass, metal or <b>aseptic</b> <b>processing</b> system containers, or further treated by dehydration processes to a concentrate. Due to the complex and costly equipment required to extract and clarify juice from apples in large volume, apple juice is normally produced commercially. In the United States, unfiltered fresh apple juice is made by smaller operations in areas of high apple production, {{in the form of}} unclarified apple cider. Apple juice {{is one of the most}} common fruit juices in the world, with world production led by China, Poland, the United States, and Germany.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Aseptic</b> <b>processing</b> is {{the process}} by which a sterile (aseptic) product (typically food or pharmaceutical) is {{packaged}} in a sterile container in a way that maintains sterility. Sterility is achieved with a flash-heating process (temperature between 195 and 295 °F (91 to 146 °C)), which retains more nutrients and uses less energy than conventional sterilization techniques such as retort or hot-fill canning. Pharmaceutical Sterile processing includes use of clean rooms, bacteria retaining filters, dry or steam heat. Aseptic food preservation methods allow processed food to keep {{for long periods of time}} without preservatives, as long as they are not opened. The aseptic packages are typically a mix of paper (70%), polyethylene (LDPE) (24%), and aluminum (6%), with a tight polyethylene inside layer. Sterile pharmaceuticals are usually packaged in plastic or glass. Together these materials form a tight seal against microbiological organisms, contaminants, and degradation, eliminating the need for refrigeration.|$|E
40|$|KUMAR, PRABHAT. <b>Aseptic</b> <b>processing</b> of a low-acid {{multiphase}} {{food product}} using a continuous flow microwave system. (Under {{the direction of}} K. P. Sandeep.) Continuous flow microwave heating is an emerging technology in the food industry with a potential to replace the conventional retort process for viscous and pumpable food products. <b>Aseptic</b> <b>processing</b> of a low-acid multiphase food product using continuous flow microwave heating system can combine the advantages of an aseptic process {{along with those of}} microwave heating. The main objective of this research was to develop a systematic approach for biological validation of <b>aseptic</b> <b>processing</b> of salsa con queso products using a continuous flow microwave system operating at 915 MHz. Dielectric properties of pumpable food products were measured by a new approach (under continuous flow conditions) and compared with the dielectric properties measured by the conventional approach (under static conditions).

40|$|AbstractThe {{concept of}} <b>aseptic</b> <b>processing</b> {{originated}} {{to solve problems}} associated with conventional ‘in-container’ sterilization of foods such as low rate of heat penetration to the slowest heating point in the container, the long processing times required to deliver the required lethality, destruction of the nutritional and sensory characteristics of the food, low productivity, and high energy costs. <b>Aseptic</b> <b>processing</b> technique has been successfully applied to liquid foods and acid foods containing discrete particulates. However, the extension of <b>aseptic</b> <b>processing</b> to heterogeneous low-acid liquid foods containing discrete particulates has been difficult {{due to lack of}} data on critical factors such as interfacial heat transfer coefficient between the liquid and the particle as well as the residence time distribution (RDT) of particles in the holding tube of the aseptic system. Geometry of holding tube represents a primary parameter in determining the residence time distribution of particulate inside an <b>aseptic</b> <b>processing</b> system. Several configuration had been investigate in the past, including curved geometries in order to minimize spreading of RTD. In the following work an experimental bypass holding tube is optimized numerically and experimentally. Numerical optimization was performed by using the Optimal Shape Design, where the essential element respect to classical numerical simulations in fixed geometrical configurations, is to introduce a certain amount of geometrical degrees of freedom {{as a part of the}} unknowns, which means that the geometry is not completely defined, but part of it is allowed to move dynamically in order to minimize or maximize the objective function...|$|E
40|$|<b>Aseptic</b> <b>processing</b> {{involves}} sterilising {{the product}} (most meat products being low-acid foods containing particulates) and package separately, and filling under sterile conditions.
