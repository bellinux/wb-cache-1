During the winter break of 1858-59, they arranged the collection into a single listing alphabetically by author. This project was finished by the time Cutter graduated in 1859. By 1860 Cutter was already a seasoned staff member of the library and a full-time librarian. He became a journeyman to the chief cataloger and assistant librarian Dr. Ezra Abbot. At Harvard College Cutter developed {{a new form of}} index catalog, using cards instead of published volumes, containing both an <b>author</b> <b>index</b> and a [...] "classed catalog" [...] or a rudimentary form of subject index.|$|E

The Critical Dictionary was projected by George W. Childs, owner of the Philaldephia Public Ledger, and cost over $60,000.
