40|$|Congress {{enacted the}} Leahy-Smith America Invents Act to {{encourage}} innovation, strengthen U. S. patents, and achieve greater uniformity with foreign patent systems. The America Invents Act introduced two new post-grant patent validity proceedings: inter partes review and post-grant review. The new U.

The U. S. proceedings result in a very limited opportunity for amendment and a high percentage of invalidated patents. In contrast, European opposition proceedings are generally more conducive to upholding patents, whether in original or amended form. The current U. S. practice for <b>amending</b> <b>claims</b> in post-grant proceedings should be changed to both achieve balance between claim vitality and extent of opportunity to amend, and to serve the America Invents Act’s goals of strengthening patents and encouraging innovation. A full adoption of the European opposition claim amendment practice, particularly the claim construction standard and expansive opportunity for amendment, would fail to balance claim vitality and ease of amendment, favor patent owners, and disserve the goals of the America Invents Act. This Note nevertheless advocates for adoption of certain European characteristics to improve U. S. post-grant proceedings...|$|R
