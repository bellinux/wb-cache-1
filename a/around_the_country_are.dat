25|$|Many {{prisons in}} the United States are overcrowded. For example, California's 33 prisons {{have a total}} {{capacity}} of 100,000, but they hold 170,000 inmates. Many prisons in California and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>are</b> forced to turn old gymnasiums and classrooms into huge bunkhouses for inmates. They do this by placing hundreds of bunk beds next to one another, in these gyms, without any type of barriers to keep inmates separated. In California, the inadequate security engendered by this situation, coupled with insufficient staffing levels, have led to increased violence and a prison health system that causes one death a week. This situation has led the courts to order California to release 27% of the current prison population, citing the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. The three-judge court considering requests by the Plata v. Schwarzenegger and Coleman v. Schwarzenegger courts found California's prisons have become criminogenic {{as a result of}} prison overcrowding.|$|E
