25|$|Players are not {{permitted}} to carry the ring over the two blue lines; they can advance the ring over the line only by passing it to another player. The ring must be touched by any other player first, but {{does not need to be}} under control before the passer take possession again (e.g., the passer bounces the ring off a player's skate and then picks it up). If a player touches the ring consecutively on both sides of the blue line their team loses possession and the opposing team is given <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>pass.</b> If the ring goes over both blue lines, the team that passed it may not touch it until the opposing team does or attempts to get the ring.|$|E
25|$|When {{the ring}} enters the crease, the goaltender then has five seconds to throw, pass with stick, deflect, or push the ring out to another player. If the goalie does not pass it within five seconds, the ring is {{awarded to the}} other team for <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>pass</b> {{from one of the}} {{defensive}} free play circles. The goalie may use the stick to touch the ring outside the crease, and can also pass through the crease, but may not pull it into the crease unless she pulls it all the way through and out with one motion. Otherwise, this results in a loss of possession, and a penalty if she has already been given a warning. The goalie may not pick up or cover the ring with her glove outside the crease. The goalie can push the ring with a hand when outside the crease, as can any other player.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, in June 1917, Gherman Pântea and {{two other}} Ninth Army soldiers—Petre Vărzaru, Ion Mitrean—were {{mandated}} by their colleagues to leave for Chișinău and organize the national movement locally. The youngest of all activists involved in the project, Pântea was elected head of the resulting Moldavian Central Committee of the Soldiers and Officers' Union. Pântea, Vărzaru and Mitrean benefited from some Russian support, after Commander Alexander Shcherbachov gave them <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>pass</b> and an indefinite leave from the Romanian front. However, their Central Committee met a new rival in the parallel Military Revolutionary Committee, formed by revolutionary Russians loyal to the Chișinău Soviet. This authority gave formal backing to its Moldavian equivalent, supporting its struggle for self-determination and even discussing a merger, but discreetly tried to combat Bessarabian Romanian influence in all other fields. A truce was agreed upon between Pântea and the Russian Committee representative Levenzon, which even allowed both organisms to share office space in the same building.|$|E

25|$|In the season-opening Daytona 500, Earnhardt began well, even leading for a lap. However {{multiple}} misfortunes, {{including a}} missed pit stop and a 1-lap penalty for pitting {{outside of his}} pit box, sent him far {{into the back of}} the running order. Earnhardt was then directly involved in a controversial crash on lap 124, when, while fighting to return to the lead lap, he came in contact with Brian Vickers while fighting to be the first driver one lap down (who gets <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>pass</b> should the caution flag come out), causing a 10-car pileup which included Denny Hamlin, Scott Speed, Jimmie Johnson, Kyle and Kurt Busch, Robby Gordon, Jamie McMurray, and Carl Edwards. Vickers and Kyle Busch later criticized Earnhardt, who denied purposely clipping Vickers. Earnhardt criticized Vickers for blocking him on the inside. When the race concluded early due to the rain, Earnhardt ended with a 27th-place finish. Earnhardt later apologized for his actions but maintains to this day that he never intended to wreck Vickers.|$|E
25|$|As {{lord of the}} region, Raymond was {{appointed}} to guide the army across Galilee. After Saladin's troops started attacking the Templars at the rear, the crusaders halted at Maskana, although the local well could not provide enough water to a large army. Ernoul blamed Raymond for this decision, but the anonymous author of the Libellus de expugnatione Terrae Sanctae per Saladinum, who also participated in the campaign, stated that the king decided to stop, ignoring Raymond's advice. Saladin's troops encircled the crusaders' camp and killed all crusaders who left it in searh for water. The following day the army continued the march towards Tiberias, with Raymond commanding the vanguard, but Saladin's troops were continuously attacking them. Suffering from thirst, a group of foot soldiers tried {{to break through the}} enemy lines towards the distant Sea of Galilee, but they were massacred. Five of Raymond's own knights voluntarily defected to Saladin's side. In an attempt to reach the springs near Hattin, Raymond led a cavalry charge against the right wing of Saladin's army, forcing the Muslim troops to open <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>pass</b> without resistance. Instead of turning back, Raymond and the crusaders who had accompanied him (including Reynald of Sidon, Balian of Ibelin and Joscelin III of Edessa) hurried first to Safed, and later to Tyre.|$|E
25|$|Bristol {{races are}} often {{the scene of the}} highest number of yellow-flag caution laps in the NASCAR season; with so many cars in such a small space, contact is almost inevitable. Until the Beneficiary Rule was instituted in 2004 (the rule was instituted after the races at Bristol in 2003), the short lap length and the {{unpredictable}} nature of the racing meant that {{this was one of the}} few remaining NASCAR tracks at which it was feasible for a driver to come back to win a race from several laps down; at most modern tracks, especially superspeedways, that was almost impossible. The short lap length also cuts the other way; any unscheduled pit stop for reasons such as a cut tire will result in the driver going two or more laps down as it is almost impossible to get anything done to a car during the time taken to complete one circuit, especially under green-flag conditions (approximately 15seconds). Thus, the disadvantage of losing laps means the chances of earning <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>pass</b> under the Beneficiary Rule is harder, since a driver losing two laps under a green-flag pit stop would have to race their way past the leader before the caution waved to regain one of their laps back, unless there are no cars one lap behind.|$|E

25|$|Roger McDowell came in {{to replace}} Fernandez in the seventh. His first batter was Tony Armas, who pinch hit for Hurst and thus ended his night. After {{striking}} him out, McDowell induced Boggs and Barrett to ground out to end the inning. The Red Sox now {{needed to make a}} pitching change, and with Boyd in no condition to pitch the bullpen was short-staffed and McNamara called on Calvin Schiraldi, his closer who had lost the previous game after pitching 2.2 innings, to face Ray Knight, Kevin Mitchell, and Rafael Santana with the pitcher's spot due up fourth. Knight greeted Schiraldi with a solo home run to give the Mets their first lead of the game. Lenny Dykstra {{came in to}} bat for Mitchell and followed with a single and advanced to second on a wild pitch. Santana then singled to score Dykstra, and after McDowell bunted Santana to second McNamara called on Joe Sambito to face Wilson. After giving Wilson <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>pass,</b> Sambito then walked Backman to load the bases for Hernandez. The Mets' captain hit a fly ball to center field that was deep enough to score Santana and advance Wilson to third. Bob Stanley, who allowed the game-winning play in Game 6, was then brought in to face Carter and got him to ground out, but the Mets were now ahead 6-3.|$|E
500|$|Davenport's talent {{came to the}} {{attention}} of C.W. Smith, general manager of the Associated Press, and also Timothy Davenport's first cousin. Smith got the young cartoonist <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>pass</b> on the railroad to San Francisco in 1891 and wrote a letter to the business manager of The San Francisco Examiner, essentially a demand that Davenport be hired. [...] He was; the Examiners business manager had been greatly impressed by doodles that Davenport drew while waiting. [...] At the Examiner, Davenport was not a cartoonist, but a newspaper artist who illustrated articles—the technology to directly reproduce photographs in newspapers was still a few years away. After a year at the Examiner, he was fired; several stories state that this occurred after he asked for a raise from his meager salary of $10 per week.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1944, with Benvenisti under arrest, Zissu {{took control}} of the Jewish {{emigration}} and self-help movement, establishing the Zionist Executive. During those months, as the Axis alliance slowly disintegrated, he reached a stalemate with the CE's Nandor Gingold and the Romanian bureaucrat Radu Lecca. Lecca awarded him recognition and allowed him to carry on with the emigration project in exchange for bribes. The Antonescu regime even proposed that he replace Gingold as CE manager, but Zissu stated his refusal, calling the institution a [...] "bureau of the Gestapo", and accusing Gingold of [...] "high treason". In 1943, the regime was persuaded by Renașterea to give Jewish orphans stranded in Transnistria <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>pass</b> to leave for Palestine.
