40|$|The {{study of}} trace metal {{speciation}} {{has benefited from}} {{a great deal of}} interest leading to the development and the diversification of sequential extraction schemes (SES), which triggered the need for harmonization by the standard, measurements and testing programme (SM & T). However, some uncertainties still persist in the application of the harmonized 3 -step protocol, because of the difficulty in conceptualizing a technique that can be applied to environmental samples irrespective of their nature. The alternative method proposed in this study is based on the solubility of the sample components progressively dissolved during the course of an <b>acidimetric</b> <b>titration</b> by 1 mol L 1 HCl. The major HCl-reactive mineralogical components are identified using mass balance calculation of H+ consumed by their dissolution together with the amount of major elements released into solution. The speciation of minor and trace elements is investigated by comparing their titrations to those of the major elements. This approach is much simpler than SES because it uses simple non-selective H+ at room temperature instead of a complex experimental design of so-called specific reagents. The different mineral components of the solid are no longer operationally defined and the problem of selectivity is irrelevant to the titration approach. The method was applied to several sediment samples from the Scheldt estuary and the particulate phase was further examined by Scanning Electron Microprobe and X-ray Diffraction techniques. The nearly complete consumption of H+ in the suspension is balanced by the total dissolution of carbonates and Fe-oxyhydroxides. In contrast to the speciation inferred from the Tessier SES, the <b>acidimetric</b> <b>titration</b> has demonstrated that the carbonate phase does not significantly contain trace metals with the exceptions of 40 % of the Mn and 30 % of the Co. In contrast, the Fe-oxyhydroxides seem {{to play a major role}} and account for 70 % of Pb and 20 % of Cr, in addition to 60 % of P and additional amounts of 20 % Co and 40 % Mn. 70 % of the Cu also occur in the oxyhydroxide phase, more likely coprecipitated with gibbsite. 90 % of the Cd and 85 % of Zn can be attributed to the Acid Volatile Sulfide (AVS) phase as evidenced from S titration. The <b>acidimetric</b> <b>titration</b> method not only provides information on the speciation of trace metals but also allows the quantification of their reactivity and mobility, if one considers that the titration roughly mimics pH changes that may occur as a result of chemical disequilibrium in the environment. The results demonstrate the potential of the <b>acidimetric</b> <b>titration</b> as an alternative to SES protocols in geochemical and environmental regulation studies. This method is applicable to a wide variety of environmental materials with little or minor adjustments. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of the interface between geosphere and biosphere {{represents one of the}} most fascinating frontiers of mineral science. Heavy metal release, transport and dispersion into the biosphere have a direct impact on the environment and on human health. New technologies for water and soils remediation represent a main task, and magnetic nanoparticles emerge {{as one of the most}} promising mean in this field. Environmental applications and risk assessment of manufactured nanoparticles greatly depend on the understanding of their interactions with water and soils. Novel superparamagnetic nanoparticles (Surface Active Maghemite Nanoparticles, SAMNs) constituted of stoichiometric maghemite, characterized by specific surface chemical behavior without any coating or superficial modification, stable in water for months as colloidal suspensions, were used as adsorbent of chromium(VI) in water. SAMNs can be superficially modified by simple incubation in presence of K 2 Cr 2 O 7, forming a hybrid nanomaterial, SAMN@Cr(VI), stable without any release of Cr(VI) in solution. The aim of this work is to test the efficiency of SAMNs for Cr(VI) removal from Stoppani Spa site, an extreme environmental polluted Cr(VI) site. Stoppani industry located in the Cogoleto and Arenzano Area (Genova, Italy), transformed Cr(III) from chromite mineral (FeCr 2 O 4) (Piccardo et al., 1989) to Cr(VI). It ceased the activity at the beginning of 2003, and since 2001, the Stoppani S. p. A. has been included, with DM n. 468, into the national program of environmental remediation and restoration. In the 1918 - 1982 period, it discharged up to 1 million tons of post-treatment mud on the neighbouring beaches, groundwater resulted heavily polluted by Cr(VI). The water samples object of this work are representative of 3 pumping wells distinguished on the basis on the Cr(VI) -content in: sample W 1 (527 < Cr(VI) < 11700 g/lt); W 6 (83800 < Cr(VI) < 146000 g/lt); W 9 (10500 < Cr(VI) < 232000 g/lt). Water temperature, electrical conductivity, alkalinity by <b>acidimetric</b> <b>titration,</b> pH, and Eh were determined during sampling. In the laboratory, waters have been analyzed for: Mg, and Ca by AAS, Na and K by AES Cl, SO 42 -, and NO 3 - by ion-chromatography, Si, Fe, minor and trace elements by ICP-OES. The application of SAMNs (100 mg mL- 1) of three water samples removed 75 - 80 % of Cr(VI), while, if the same treatment was accomplished at pH 3. 0, Cr(VI) removal was about 95 % with respect the initial concentration. Temperature, in the 4 - 25 °C range, did not influence Cr(VI) removal by SAMNs. A second SAMN treatment on the same water samples increased Cr(VI) removal efficiency up to 98 %, leading to a final Cr(VI) concentration below the limits stated by Italian law. SAMNs represent efficient candidates for Cr(VI) removal from aqueous polluted environments...|$|E

The refractory oxide is dissolved directly in hydrofluoric acid. The identical procedure is used for metal after ignition to the oxide. Concentrations of beryllium over certain limits have a quenching effect on the fluorescence of the aluminum-Portachrome Blue Black R complex. The determination of trace amounts of aluminum in beryilium can be carried out despite this quenching effect by the method of standard addition. Samples of plutonium sulfate tetrahydrate prepared 9 to 12 months earlier were under investigation to determine the suitability of this compound as a primary analytical standard of plutonium. The compound was determined experimentally to contain four molecules of water of crystallization. Plutonium sulfate tetrahydrate was found to lose a major portion of its water of crystallization when heated at 115 ts C. Indications, but no conclusive evidence, of the existence of another intermediate hydrate of plutonium(IV) sulfate, were found. Microscopic examination of 1 -year-old crystals of Pu(S 0 /sub 4 /) /sub 2 /. 4 H/sub 2 / 0 shows no evidence of the effect of any alpha radiolysis on the water of crystallization. Continued exposure to a fluctuating atmosphere caused no apparent changes in crystal structure or weight. Heating Pu(SO/sub 4 /) /sub 2 /. 4 H/sub 2 / 0 to 325 ts C produced a dehydrated salt of weight equivalent to the formula, Pu(S 0 /sub 4 /) /sub 2 /. This material, although slightly hygroscopic, can be readily dried at 120 ts C and appears to be satisfactory for further investigation of its suitability as an alternate primary stand ard of plutonium. A method is presented for the rapid determination of milligram quantities of sulfateiIn pure plutonium sulfates. Plutonium is adsorbed on a cation resin and an <b>acidimetric</b> <b>titration</b> is made of the displaced hydrogen ion which is equivalent to the sulfate content of the sample. A technique used for the prevention of plutonium hydrolysis in neutral solution is described. The method may be applied to the determination of sulfate in any pure plutonium sulfate. A method is described for sampling and analyzing uranium in graphite waste. Sampling data indicate that representative sampling is obtained if the material is pulverized to less than 30 -mesh size before reducing to 20 to 50 -g portions for analysis.

40|$|Cu and Zn isotope {{biogeochemistry}} {{has already}} been applied to study oceanic environments via deep ocean carbonates (Pichat et al., 2003), sediment trap samples, sediments and Fe-Mn nodules (Maréchal et al., 2000). So far, no study has been published on Cu and Zn isotopic fractionation in estuarine environments, while estuaries represent fundamental stages in the hydrological and geochemical cycles of these metals. Estuarine environments are characterized by strong physico-chemical gradients (pH, eH, dissolved oxygen, [...] .) related to marine- and fresh waters mixing and important biological activity (Paucot et al., 1997). Those physico-chemical gradients induce important redistribution of trace elements between dissolved and particulate phases. We therefore anticipate fractionation of Cu and Zn isotopes to occur in estuaries with {{a greater extent than}} in open ocean. This study focuses on results of Cu and Zn elemental and isotopic compositions of centrifuged suspended particulate matter (SPM) of the Scheldt estuary (Belgium and Netherlands, campain Eurothroph April 2003). Samples were collected at 6 stations along a 100 km transect (Belgica vessel). Present results are compared with previous data obtained on surface sediments and SPM of November 2002 (Petit et al., 2004). Prior to standard HF+HNO 3 dissolution procedure, organic matter was digested by repeated additions of concentrated H 2 O 2. Separation of Cu, Fe and Zn was carried out by one step ion-exchange chromatography on AG-MP 1 resin. To avoid fractionation artifacts, the full recovery of Cu, Fe and Zn from different matrix samples (basalt, sediment and limestone) was quantitatively verified. Total blanks were negligible: 1. 5; 11 and 4. 5 ng for Cu, Fe and Zn, respectively. Cu and Zn isotopic ratios were measured with a “Nu-Plasma” MC-ICP-MS (ULB). Instrumental mass bias was corrected by simultaneous standard-sample bracketing and external normalisation, assuming an exponential mass fractionation law. Reference materials were Zn JMC and Cu NIST SRM 976 standards. The Nu plasma allowed 60 Ni to be simultaneously monitored and used for systematic correction on 64 Zn. Reference materials were repeatedly measured, giving a long-term reproducibility of ± 0. 07 per mil for delta 65 Cu and delta 66 Zn (2 s, n= 158 over 13 analysis sessions). Average total beam intensities are 6 V/ppm. The whole methodology has been checked for spectral and non-spectral interferences, as well as artifacts related to analyte-to-dopant concentration ratios. Each sample was analyzed for at least three concordant replicates. Profiles of concentration vs. salinity show expected Cu and Zn enrichments in SPM in the upper estuary and a non conservative decrease seaward. As a whole, Cu and Zn concentration range from 100 ppm (at 5 psu) to 0. 6 ppm (at 30 psu) and from 600 ppm (at 5 psu) to 100 ppm (at 30 psu), respectively. Delta 66 Zn values of SPM describe a positive linear correlation with salinity, i. e. a "conservative" trend from 0. 24 ± 0. 07 per mil at 1 psu to 0. 61 ± 0. 01 per mil at 30 psu. In contrast, delta 65 Cu shows rapid variations from 0. 00 ± 0. 03 per mil at 1 psu to + 0. 99 ± 0. 03 per mil at 3 psu down to - 0. 78 ± 0. 02 per mil at 13 psu. Those contrasted behavior and amplitude of variation may reflect differences in reactivity of species related to Cu and Zn speciation, as can be revealed by <b>acidimetric</b> <b>titration.</b> When both seasons are considered, delta 65 Cu variations in the SPM are more important in April 2003 relative to November 2002 (1. 44 against 0. 37 per mil, respectively), while delta 66 Zn results show no significant seasonal change. Compared to sediments, SPM samples are systematically enriched in light Cu and Zn isotopes in the lower estuary (downstream the Maximum Turbidity Zone) where sediments show a regular increase in delta 66 Zn and delta 65 Cu seaward. This study provides a stepping-stone for further investigation of exchange processes of metals between particulate and dissolved phases in estuarine environment. These preliminary results pinpoint significant spatial and temporal variations in isotopic compositions of particulate Cu and Zn as well as contrasted isotopic signatures between sediments and suspended particulate matter. Cu and Zn isotopic variations within estuarine particulate phases suggest to revisit the use of particulate Cu and Zn for constraining their biogeochemical, behavior, so far essentially studied via the dissolved phase...|$|E
