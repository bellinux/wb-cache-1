5|$|The {{characters}} and graphics received positive reviews. Although IGN {{felt that the}} in-depth character traits in Final Fantasy IX could be generally found in other Final Fantasy games, it still found the characters to be engaging and sympathetic. GameSpot found the characters, up to their dialogue and traits, amusing and full of humor. IGN {{also noted that the}} Active Time Event system helps to expand the player's understanding of the characters' personalities as they question many ideas and emotions. Their semi-deformed appearance, which also covers monsters of every size, contain detailed animation and design. They gave praise to the pre-rendered backgrounds, noting the careful attention given to the artwork, movement in animations and character interactivity. The movies are seen as emotive <b>and</b> <b>compelling,</b> and the seamless transition and incorporation to the in-game graphics helped to move the plot well.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{historian}} A.D. Lee, {{there is little}} evidence to support this view <b>and</b> <b>compelling</b> reasons to reject it. Firstly, the late army clearly was not, and did not become, ineffective. The regular army in the West remained a formidable force until the political disintegration of the West in mid-5th century and continued to win most of its major encounters with barbarian forces e.g. the defeat of Radagaisus in 405. In any case, the Eastern empire did not collapse, even though its army probably contained at least the same proportion of barbarians as the West, if not greater. An analysis of the ethnicity of Roman army officers named in the sources shows that in the period 350–99, 23% were probably barbarian-born. The same figure for period 449–76 officers, virtually all Easterners (as the Western army had largely dissolved) was 31%. In the Notitia, 55 Eastern regiments carry barbarian names, compared with 25 in the Western army.|$|E
5|$|Singapore's Foreign Ministry {{said that}} a team {{including}} Attorney-General Lucien Wong, and Chan Sek Keong, S. Jayakumar and Tommy Koh (who had represented Singapore at the original ICJ hearing), had been appointed to study {{and respond to the}} claim. On 5 February 2017, Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam commented that on a cursory examination of the documents without detailed legal advice, he did not see how the documents would make any difference to the ICJ's judgment. On 2 March, Foreign Minister Dr Vivian Balakrishnan said in Parliament that the Singapore legal team has studied Malaysia’s application carefully, including the three documents relied on by Malaysia to support its application, and strongly believes that the documents relied on by Malaysia do not satisfy the criteria under Article 61. Singapore has until 14 June to submit to the ICJ its comprehensive <b>and</b> <b>compelling</b> rebuttal to Malaysia’s application.|$|E

25|$|Despite some {{positive}} critical notice, only after his best {{years as a}} writer did Thompson achieve a measure of fame.

25|$|An {{independent}} thinker {{and committed}} individualist, characterized by moral intransigence, a lucid critic {{of his era}} and of his country's negative aspects, Philippide refused to be pigeonholed into a single ideological current, thus occupying a rare position for the time. His original thought combined tendencies normally thought of as contradictory: to his Junimist foundations were added small portions of socialist-tinted humanitarianism and Sămănătorist-Poporanist nationalism, {{as well as a}} hefty dose of German notions. Nevertheless, in the view of literary critic Antonio Patraș, they managed to form a coherent <b>and</b> <b>compelling</b> whole, lending scientific but also moral authority to his writings.|$|E
