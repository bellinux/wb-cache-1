40|$|Manual cell {{counting}} in microscopic {{images is}} usually tedious, time consuming {{and prone to}} human error. Several programs for automatic cell counting have been developed so far, {{but most of them}} demand some specific knowledge of image analysis and/or manual fine tuning of various parameters. Even if a set of filters is found and fine tuned to the specific application, small changes to the image attributes might make the <b>automatic</b> <b>counter</b> very unreliable. The goal {{of this article is to}} present a new application that overcomes this problem by learning the set of parameters for each application, thus making it more robust to changes in the input images. The users must provide only a small representative subset of images and their manual count, and the program offers a set of automatic counters learned from the given input. The user can check the counters and choose the most suitable one.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new symbolic representation based on an original generalization of counter abstraction. Unlike classical counter abstraction (used {{in the analysis of}} parameterized systems with unordered or unstructured topologies) the new representation is tailored for proving properties of linearly ordered parameterized systems, i. e., systems with arbitrary many finite processes placed in an array. The relative positions in the array capture the relative priorities of the processes. Configurations of such systems are finite words of arbitrary lengths. The processes communicate using global transitions constrained by their relative priorities. Intuitively, an element of the symbolic representation has a base and a set of counters. It denotes configurations that respect the constraints imposed by the counters and that have the base as a sub word. We use the new representation in a uniform and <b>automatic</b> <b>Counter</b> Example Guided Refinement scheme. We {{introduce a}} relaxation operator that allows a well quasi ordering argument for the termination of each iteration of the refinement loop.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the responses of the Salmonella/microsome microsuspension assay with the new microplate fluctuation protocol (MPF) for the evaluation of the mutagenic activity of environmental samples. Organic extracts of total particulate atmospheric air samples, surface waters, and effluents were tested in dose-response experiments. The assays were performed with strain TA 98 in the absence and presence of S 9 mix. Both protocols produced similar results, despite the fact that the maximum score of the MPF is limited to 48 wells, whereas in the regular plate assay it is possible to count up to 1, 500 colonies using an <b>automatic</b> <b>counter.</b> Similar sensitivities based on the lowest dose that resulted in a positive response were obtained for both assays. The MPF procedure is less laborious (e. g., all-liquid format, use of multi-channel pipettors) and allows for automation of the pipetting and dispensing steps, thus, reducing time of the analysis which is particularly important in environmental quality monitoring programs or in effect-directed analysis. The results show that the MPF procedure is a promising tool to test environmental samples for mutagenic activity. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 51 : 31 - 38, 2010. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

This is the first report about the prevalence of hemoglobinopathies in Kocaeli. Materials and Methods: The study covered screening from July 2005 to the end of December 2008. Under the auspices of the Ministry of Health and regional health authorities, blood samples of the couples were obtained during admission to the marriage office. Complete blood counts and hemoglobin variant analysis were performed with <b>automatic</b> <b>counter</b> and high pressure liquid chromatography technique. Genetic counseling was given to carriers of thalassemia and abnormal hemoglobins. Results: A total of 88, 888 people were screened. The frequencies of β-thalassemia trait and sickle cell anemia trait were 0. 89 % and 0. 05 %, respectively. The frequency of couples with high-risk of having a sibling with homozygous hemoglobinopathy was 0. 01 %. Conclusion: The prevalence of β-thalassemia trait and sickle cell anemia trait was quite low and reflects the frequency in eastern and northern Anatolia and migration to Kocaeli from these geographic regions. Although frequency is low, the chronic transfusion requirement, high cost of chelating, organ damage, painful crisis and other crisis, and availability of stem cell transplantation only for a limited number of patients with compatible sibling donors justify premarital screening studies even in regions with lower prevalence such as Kocaeli...|$|E

Mobile operators also monitor counters to see, what base station is capable of. Each base station has hundreds of different counters, measuring numerous different things continuously. Counter information {{is provided by the}} base station software, which takes care of keeping all the counters up-to-date. Nowadays base stations are very efficient, and they are capable to handle thousands of different requests in the blink of the eye. Increasing complexity of the product poses an enormous challenge for counters, since calculating the values for each counter gets more complex. This research was conducted in Finnish large-scale telecommunications company. Although counters are extremely important for customers, they are not verified effectively in case company’s LTE PDCP/RLC/MAC layer’s capacity tests. The goal of this research is to create a mechanism, which makes it possible to easily enable <b>automatic</b> <b>counter</b> verification in any automated capacity test case. Design science research was applied to achieve this goal. In this research, literature review is conducted to gain understanding for LTE, 3 GPP throughput counters, and about the capacity testing environment of the case company. Then a new counter verification system for LTE PDCP/RLC/MAC layer’s capacity tests is designed and implemented. After the system is implemented, expected counter values need to be calculated for each test case and counter, which are part of this research. Evaluation of the system is made against the system requirements and to accuracy of limit value calculations. As a conclusion, {{it can be said that}} the implementation of the system was a success, but in some of the test cases, counters provided unexpected results. The implemented system was able to catch the faults, but the root causes for problems are not clear. In total, 185 test case – counter combinations were verified, and in almost 13 % of them counter verification failed the test case, because counter provided unexpected value.

Se consideraron para anemia valores OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate the}} magnitude of the anemia, to analyze the time trends and investigate the factors associated with this disturbance in children in the state of Paraíba, Brazil. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey, of population-based, with 1108 children, aged 6 to 59 months, both sexes in the state of Paraíba. Hemoglobin (Hb) in venous blood was analyzed with an <b>automatic</b> <b>counter.</b> The social-economic and demographic characteristics of children were obtained by questionnaire. Proportions were compared by Pearson's chi-squared test, and the association between hemoglobin concentrations and potential risk factors was tested by regression model Poisson. The time trend of anemia was assessed by the increase/decreased in the prevalence of anemia, using as comparison the prevalence observed in the years 1982, 1992 and 2007. RESULTS: The prevalence of anemia (Hb < 11. 0 g/dl) in the state of Paraíba was 36. 5 % (CI 95 % 33. 7 to 39. 3). It was observed that 1. 3 % (CI 95 % 0. 7 to 1. 8) were in severe form (Hb < 7. 0 g/dl), 11 % (CI 95 % 9. 4 to 13. 5) in a moderate form and 87. 6 % (CI 95 % 79. 1 to 91. 2) in the mild form. There was an increase 88. 5 % in cases of anemia between the years 1982 - 1992 and stabilization in the prevalence between the years 1992 - 2007.
