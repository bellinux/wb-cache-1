After an awkward start, when Sunderland broke off the engagement for no known reason, {{the marriage was}} <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> one: Lady Sunderland was rumoured to have had numerous lovers, {{but there is little}} evidence to support this, and Sunderland, despite his questionable political principles, was a devoted husband and father. They had at least five children.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{measuring}} {{the utility of}} a population based on the average utility of that population avoids Parfit's repugnant conclusion but causes other problems. For example, bringing a moderately happy person into <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> world {{would be seen as}} an immoral act; aside from this, the theory implies {{that it would be a}} moral good to eliminate all people whose happiness is below average, as this would raise the average happiness.|$|E

25|$|On 15 September 1956, Hanson {{at the age}} of 43 {{married a}} 23-year-old Conservatorium student, Moira Winifred Young, at St. Matthew's Anglican Church, Manly. The {{marriage}} was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> union despite the unconventionality of the age difference. The couple moved house several times {{over the next few years}} as prior to Hanson being placed on salary all teaching staff at the Con were contract players. Hanson's health deteriorated and in 1967 he suffered a heart attack.

Towards {{the close of the}} year, he returned to Kassel, where his mother and Wilhelm had settled, the latter having finished his studies. The next year, he obtained a position in the war office with the very small salary of 100 thalers. One of his grievances was that he had to exchange his stylish Paris suit for a stiff uniform and pigtail. But he had full leisure for the pursuit of his studies.|$|E

They became lovers after arriving in Paris, where they socialized with Stein and Pablo Picasso before leaving for the Villa Curonia, where the guests included Arthur Rubinstein. At first this was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> time for the couple, but tensions grew between them as Reed became uncomfortable with the affluent isolation, and Dodge saw his interests in the world of people and achievements as a rejection of her. They returned to New York in late September, 1913. In October, Reed was sent to report on the Mexican Revolution by Metropolitan Magazine. Although Dodge followed him to the border town of Presidio, she left after just a few days.|$|E

500|$|I'm writing {{short stories}} right now, that's what I do between novels, and I love them. I'm very devoted to it. You know, it's funny. There {{seems to be}} some sort of law that you only get to be celebrated for one or the other. And then a couple of people will break it. Updike did. They didn't review his story {{collections}} by saying, [...] "Well, these are nice, but he's a novelist." [...] Or review his novels by saying, [...] "Well, too bad he can't do the longer stuff." [...] Other people tend to get patronized on one end or the other—and I'll take it. I have <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> life as a novelist. But the story collections I've published are tremendously important to me. And many of the uncollected stories—or yet-to-be-collected stories—are among my proudest writings. They're very closely allied, obviously, to novel writing. But also very distinct, and, you know, there's no need to choose.|$|E

It's really a song for everybody out there who's every lost love, who's ever been broken-hearted." [...] The lyrics to [...] "If I Was a Folkstar" [...] were written by Toro y Moi about him and his wife taking LSD on the beach shortly after they got married. The title of the album, Wildflower, was chosen for its simplicity. The group was inspired by other albums with simple titles which do not distract from the music, such as Smile by the Beach Boys. The cover art is a direct reference to Sly and the Family Stone's There's a Riot Goin' On (1971) [...] in order to draw from the record's rebellious counter-culture nature, however approaching a more psychedelic style.|$|E
500|$|Instead {{of writing}} a piece for {{production}} by a theatre proprietor, as was usual in Victorian theatres, Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte produced the show with their own financial support. [...] They were therefore able to select their own cast of performers, rather than being obliged to use the actors already engaged at the theatre. [...] They chose talented actors, {{most of whom were}} not well-known stars and did not command high fees, and to whom they could teach a more naturalistic style of performance than was commonly used at the time. [...] Carte's talent agency provided many of the artists to perform in the new work. [...] They then tailored their work to the particular abilities of these performers. [...] Some of the cast members, including principal comedian George Grossmith, Richard Temple and Rutland Barrington, stayed with the company for almost 15 years. [...] Two other longstanding members of the company were Rosina Brandram, who started in D'Oyly Carte touring companies with The Sorcerer, and Jessie Bond who joined the group for Pinafore at the Opera Comique in 1878.

Marcia Adair of the Los Angeles Times commented in reviewing Dream With Me that [...] "her voice has matured quite a lot over the past 10 months. ... hat makes us feel like she will survive the journey from child star to adult performer is her magnificent sense of pitch, her natural ability to shape phrases and the ease with which she performs." [...] Jon Caramanica, in The New York Times, reviewed her Avery Fisher Hall concert: [...] "In {{the first half of the}} show Ms. Evancho often receded, but toward the end of the night she found purpose, delivering 'A Time for Us' with punch, and closing out Sarah McLachlan’s 'Angel' with what felt like real yearning".
