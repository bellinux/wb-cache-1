5|$|Health care in Turkey {{used to be}} {{dominated}} by a centralised state system run by the Ministry of Health. In 2003, the government introduced a sweeping health reform programme aimed at increasing the ratio of private to state health provision and making healthcare available to <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the population. Turkish Statistical Institute announced that 76.3 billion TL was spent for healthcare in 2012; 79.6 percent of which was covered by the Social Security Institution and 15.4 percent of which was paid directly by the patients. In 2012, there were 29,960 medical institutions in Turkey, and on average one doctor per 583 people and 2.65 beds per 1000 people.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, it was {{reported}} that Nu Image/Millennium Films was in negotiations with an unnamed Chinese distributor. The distributor would produce the film, in exchange for a Chinese actor (Donnie Yen) being cast and filming in China. The partnership was considered to make a Chinese release of the film easier, and would have granted Millennium Films <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> its Chinese revenue. However, the partnership fell apart before production began. However, another Chinese studio, Le Vision Pictures, invested in the film. Lionsgate Films purchased the North American and United Kingdom distribution rights to the film for $35million.|$|E

5|$|Though Taylor's {{friendship}} and partnership with Clough had been strong, their relationship had sometimes become strained on occasion. While at Derby in 1971, Taylor was riled {{when he learned}} that Clough had failed to disclose to him that he had received a pay rise of £5,000 from chairman Sam Longson. He was also annoyed that Clough was often away earning extra money from media work while he was left to do <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the work with the players. The relationship worsened in the autumn of 1980 when Taylor published With Clough, by Taylor, an autobiography which was largely based on Taylor's work with Clough. Taylor had not told Clough that he was writing the book and did not give him a share of the proceeds.|$|E
5|$|While most of {{the large}} {{hydropower}} plants in Russia date from the Soviet era, the abundance of fossil fuels in the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation has resulted in little need {{for the development of}} other renewable energy sources. There are currently plans to develop all types of renewable energy, which is strongly encouraged by the Russian government. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has called for renewable energy to have <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> Russia's energy output, and has taken steps to promote the development of renewable energy in Russia since 2008.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, the {{executive}} board of the state railways wanted to centralise the operation of restaurant carriages {{and the most important}} station restaurants in Norway under one management. The board stated that they wanted to minimise the conflict of interest between the railway company and the dining-car operator. They also saw centralising operations as a way to allocate <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the revenue to the railway company, and to ensure a high quality of service on new lines. At that time the Sørland Line and Dovre Line were in the planning stages, and the NSB intended to introduce dining services on these when they opened. Oslo East Station and its restaurant were operated by the private Norwegian Trunk Railway. In an agreement signed on 18 September 1918 both railway companies agreed that a new restaurant operator would be controlled by the Norwegian Trunk Railway, but this company had to abide by the NSB's decision of how many restaurant carriages to operate on any line.|$|E

40|$|Using {{data from}} 58 {{countries}} and the period 1980 to 2003, this paper analyzes how {{the size of government}} affects unemployment in developing countries. According to the regression results, <b>a</b> <b>large</b> government sector is likely to increase unemployment. <b>A</b> <b>large</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> government consumption in total consumption and <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> transfers and subsidies in GDP most clearly appear to have a detrimental effect. By contrast, we do not find evidence that dominant state-owned enterprises and <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> public investment in total investment affect unemployment, neither for bad nor for good. The results are robust to variations in specification and estimation method...|$|R

5|$|In 1971, a state {{committee}} {{recommended that}} Gardermoen {{be expanded to}} take <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the traffic from Fornebu. At the same time, a new main airport was eventually to be built at Hobøl. From 1971, charter flights were moved to Gardermoen, although SAS and Braathens SAFE were granted dispensation so they only needed to serve one Oslo airport. On 1 July 1971, Widerøe also started serving domestic routes to Fornebu, {{with the opening of}} a regional airport in Sogn og Fjordane. These routes were served using de Havilland Canada Twin Otter and later de Havilland Canada Dash 7 aircraft, although regular services to all airports were not introduced until the late 1970s, with the introduction of the Dash 7. The last four primary airports were opened during the 1970s. Braathens SAFE started flights to Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget in 1972, Molde Airport, Årø in 1972 and Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes in 1973. In 1975, SAS started flights to Haugesund Airport, Karmøy.|$|E

Internazionale faced Bulgarian side CSKA Red Flag (now CSKA Sofia). Giacinto Facchetti scored for Internazionale, as they drew 1–1 at home, with Nikola Tsanev scoring for the visitors. Facchetti scored again in Bulgaria, but {{his goal was}} cancelled out by Nikolay Radlev, meaning that a play-off was needed to settle the tie. The play-off {{was supposed to be}} held in Graz, Austria, but CSKA were persuaded to let it be moved to Bologna in Italy, after they were offered <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the gate money. The match was won 1–0 by Internazionale, thanks to a goal from Cappellini, sealing their place in the final.|$|E
5|$|The {{agreements}} with Spanish authorities allowed only airlines {{from the country}} of origin or from Spain to fly charter flights. But because of the SAS-cooperation, an agreement was made where any Scandinavian airline could fly to Spain {{from any of the}} three Scandinavian countries. Domestically, Braathens SAFE received strong competition from Sterling Airways, {{but on the other hand}} this allowed Braathens SAFE to fly charter flights from Sweden. In 1968, the large Swedish–Danish charter airline Internord went bankrupt, giving Braathens SAFE increased charter traffic. The company also started purchasing <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> Altas Resor, until it took over all the whole company in 1978. In Sweden, Braathens SAFE used its partners to sell charter flights to Norway, and then continue their flights using scheduled flights. Braathens SAFE was hindered by the charter regulations from making intercontinental flights, as well as flights between the Scandinavian capitals. The rules also forced business travelers to use scheduled flights.|$|E

5|$|The Americans, British, and French all {{differed}} on {{the issue}} of reparations settlement. The Western Front had been fought in France, and that countryside had been heavily scarred in the fighting. France's most industrialized region in the north-east had been laid to waste during the German retreat. Hundreds of mines and factories were destroyed along with railroads, bridges and villages. Georges Clemenceau, the Prime Minister of France, thought it appropriate that any just peace required Germany to pay reparations for the damage they had caused. He also saw reparations as a means to ensure that Germany could not again threaten France and as well to weaken the German ability to compete with France's industrialization. Reparations would also go towards the reconstruction costs in other countries, such as Belgium, also directly affected by the war. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George opposed harsh reparations in favour of a less crippling reparations settlement so that the German economy could remain a viable economic power and British trading partner. He furthermore argued that reparations should include war pensions for disabled veterans and allowances to be paid to war widows, which would, reserve <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the reparations for the British Empire. Wilson opposed these positions, and was adamant that there be no indemnity imposed upon Germany.|$|E
