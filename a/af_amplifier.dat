5000|$|Plate {{detector}} circuits usually lack an A.V.C. bias circuit. In receivers {{equipped with}} A.V.C., volume levels are adjusted by a potentiometer (typically 500 k立 to 2 M立 audio taper) that controls audio signal levels at the control grid of the <b>A.F.</b> <b>amplifier.</b> In receivers not equipped with A.V.C., {{the most common}} connection of the volume control potentiometer (typically 4 k立 to 15 k立 linear taper) is as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|Incoming rx {{signals are}} fed {{to one of}} 5 Low Pass filters and {{continues}} to the RF unit. Via several bandpass filters the signal goes through RF amplifier and mixer unit before being delivered to the IF unit and <b>AF</b> <b>amplifier.</b> The receiver front end uses Schottky barrier diodes which results in good performance {{in the presence of}} strong signals. The lownoise premix local oscillator optimizes its receiving performance. A 5 pole IF filter allows a variable IF bandwidth and an optional filter may be put in place for demanding operators. Rx is single conversion superheterodyne functioning in AM/CW/SSB mode and in double conversion mode when the FM print is installed.|$|E
50|$|In the bi-grid type of tetrode, both grids are {{intended}} to carry electrical signals, so both are control grids. The first example to appear in Britain was the Marconi-Osram FE1, which was designed by H.J. Round, and became available in 1920. The tube {{was intended to be}} used in a reflex circuit (for example the single-valve ship receiver Type 91)where the same valve performed the multiple functions of rf amplifier, <b>af</b> <b>amplifier,</b> and diode detector. The rf signal was applied to one control grid, and the af signal to the other. This type of tetrode was used in many imaginative ways in the period before the appearance of the screen-grid valve revolutionised receiver design.One application is shown in the illustration. This is recognisable as an AM telephony transmitter in which the second grid and the anode form a power oscillator, and the first grid acts as a modulating electrode. The anode current in the valve, and hence the RF output amplitude, is modulated by the voltage on G1, which is derived from a carbon microphone.A tube of this type could also be used as a direct conversion CW receiver. Here the valve oscillates as a consequence of coupling between the first grid and the anode, while the second grid is coupled to the antenna. The AF beat frequency is audible in the headphones. The valve acts as a self-oscillating product detector.Another, very similar application of the bi-grid valve was as a self oscillating frequency mixer in early superhet receivers One control grid carried the incoming rf signal, while the other was connected into an oscillator circuit which generated the local oscillation within the same valve. Since the anode current of the bi-grid valve was proportional both to the signal on the first grid, and also to the oscillator voltage on the second grid, the required multiplication of the two signals was achieved, and the intermediate frequency signal appeared in an appropriately tuned circuit connected to the anode. In all of the applications mentioned, the bi-grid tetrode acted as an analogue multiplier (analog multiplier) which multiplied together the signals applied to the two grids.|$|E
50|$|Like most <b>A.F.</b> <b>amplifiers</b> in radios, {{the plate}} voltage is usually less than 60 volts. When a tetrode or pentode is used, the screen grid voltage is usually about {{one-half}} the plate voltage.|$|R

40|$|Relay/cooperative {{communication}} {{has been}} an active area {{of research in the}} past few years. In most of the investigations, the amplifiers used in the system are assumed to be linear. In this thesis, we first investigate the effect of amplifier non-linearity has on the bit-error-rate (BER) of a two-way cooperative communication system that employs linear modulation and amplify-and-forward (AF). It was found that irreducible error floor arises, caused by the inter-modulation effect with non-linear amplification and the subsequent imperfect self-interference cancellation. As a result of this finding, we propose two signal forwarding techniques that offer MPSK modulations immunity against non-linear amplifier distortion. The first technique, termed multiply-and-forward (MF), scales the product of the two received signals at the relay for downlink transmission. The second technique, termed phase-forward (PF), has a similar product structure, except that the amplitude information in the product signal is discarded. We show that both schemes do not exhibit the irreducible error characteristic found in <b>AF</b> when the <b>amplifier</b> is non-linear. The PF scheme, in particular, can attain a BER lower than that of AF even when the amplifier is linear. The conclusion is reached that MF and PF are suitable signal forwarding strategies for two-way cooperative communication in the presence of amplifier non-linearity, with PF being the more robust of the two. Due to the multiplicative nature of the MF and PF, self-informantion cancellation becomes simple when differential modulation is used in the two-way cooperative relay system. With differential modulation, there is no explicit channel state information (CSI) estimation and and this leads to a saving of pilot symbol overhead. In the second and third parts of this thesis proposal, we extend the MF and PF protocols to DPSK and CPFSK modulations. Specifically, we demonstrate that the proposed forwarding methods has low computational complexity at the relay as well as simple self-information cancellation at the receiver in the last phase of the cooperative communication. Based on the results we have obtained on the new relay forwarding protocols, we can see that the MF and PF are two promising forwarding techniques and they worth further study and refinement...|$|R
