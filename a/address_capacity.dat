It is shown that tuning a parameter of the WDF employed helps to partially flatten the in-band cross-spectrum of a pair of spreading and despreading functions. Numerical results show that the capacity of the proposed system improves over the conventional system using rectangular despreading function.

40|$|Abstract—Capacity {{limitation}} {{is one of}} the fundamental issues in wireless mesh networks. This paper <b>addresses</b> <b>capacity</b> improvement issues in multi-radio multi-channel wireless mesh networks. Our objective is to find a dynamic channel assignment and link schedule that maximizes the network capacity for ftp-type applications and video-type applications respectively. Specifically, we minimize the number of time slots needed to schedule all the flows for ftp-type applications and maximize the minimal link satisfaction ratio for video-type applications. The problems are formulated into linear programming models and we provide two heuristics to solve these problems. One heuristic uses a set covering strategy and the other uses a link-weightadjusting strategy. We do a trade-off analysis between network performance and hardware cost {{based on the number of}} radios and channels in different topologies. This work provides valuable insights for wireless mesh network designers during network planning and deployment. I...|$|R

This addressing technique, based {{on the use of}} software/hardware systems and reduced physical addresses, enlarges the interfacing capacity of the microprocessor-based systems and improves the speed of data exchange. The input of our system hardware part will be connected to the system bus. The output, which is a new bus, will be connected to an external device. To accomplish the bus transactions, the hardware part realizes a conversion of system bus data into new bus addresses. Furthermore, the software part ensures the transfer, with distinct addresses, of the simple data and the data that is intended to be converted.

Under this constraint, it is not immediately clear if one should use these radios to perform full-duplex self-interference cancelation or use the radios to give additional MIMO multiplexing advantage. We find that repurposing radios for cancellation, instead of using all of them for half-duplex over-the-air transmission, can be beneficial since the resulting full-duplex system performs better in some practical SNR regimes and almost always outperforms half duplex in symmetric degrees-of-freedom (large SNR regime).

We propose an information theoretic capacity analysis framework for biometric hashing methods by {{taking into account}} their noise resilience which {{is analogous to the}} variations of the inputs for same user. To validate the proposed framework, we make simulations with various biometric hashing methods proposed in the literature on three different face image databases. We experimentally estimate the number of different users that a biometric hashing system can accommodate by assuming that every biometric hash vector is possible to be chosen for biometric template and within-class variations can be considered as noise and each bit position has the same probabilities. Besides, we calculate equal error rate performances of the biometric hashing methods and compare them with the proposed capacity analysis framework...|$|E
