5000|$|Potential {{benefits}} of the Tweel include not only the obvious safety and convenience of never having flat tires, but also, in automotive applications, the Tweel airless tire {{has the potential to}} be able to brake better - a significant performance compromise that is inherent to pneumatic tires. Unlike a pneumatic tire, a Tweel can be designed to have high lateral stiffness while simultaneously having low vertical stiffness. This can be achieved because, in the design elements of a Tweel, the vertical <b>and</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>stiffness</b> are not inseparably linked and can thus be optimized independently. Because there is no air bladder under the tread, tread patterns can, if desired, even incorporate water evacuation through holes in the design thus eliminating or significantly reducing hydroplaning. Michelin expects the tread to last two to three times as long as a conventional tire. [...] Because the tread rubber around the outer circumference is replaceable when worn (as opposed to disposing of a whole worn tire), the potential environmental impact of a Tweel airless tire can be less than that of a conventional pneumatic tire.|$|E

Nominally spherical tips, made by bending crystals or cutting crystalline or amorphous solids, are pressed into a flat, elastic substrate. The normal displacement, contact radius, stress distribution, friction <b>and</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>stiffness</b> are examined as a function of load and adhesion. The atomic scale roughness present on any tip made of discrete atoms is shown to have profound effects on the results. Contact areas, local stresses, and the work of adhesion change by factors of two to four, and the friction <b>and</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>stiffness</b> vary by orders of magnitude. The microscopic factors responsible for these changes are discussed. The results are also used to test methods for analyzing experimental data with continuum theory to determine information, such as contact area, that can not be measured directly in nanometer scale contacts. Even when the data appear to be fit by continuum theory, extracted quantities can differ substantially from their true values...|$|E

The model simulates two standard loading conditions to understand the vertical compliance <b>and</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>stiffness</b> characteristics of 82 existing bicycle frames from the bicycle geometry project and compares these characteristics to an optimised solution in these conditions. Perhaps unsurprisingly smaller frames (490 mm seat tube) behave the most favourably {{in terms of both}} vertical compliance <b>and</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>stiffness,</b> while the shorter top tube length (525 mm) and larger head tube angle (74. 5 °) results in a laterally stiffer frame which corresponds with findings from literature. The optimised values show a considerable improvement over the best of the existing frames, with a 13 % increase in vertical displacement and 15 % decrease in lateral displacement when compared to the best of the analysed frames. The model has been developed to allow for further develop to include more detailed tube geometry, further analysis of more frame geometries, alternative materials, and analysis of other structural characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Theropod dinosaurs show {{striking}} morphological {{and functional}} tail variation; e. g., a long, robust, basal theropod tail used for counterbalance, or a short, modern avian tail {{used as an}} aerodynamic surface. We used a quantitative morphological and functional analysis to reconstruct intervertebral joint stiffness in the tail along the theropod lineage to extant birds. This provides new details of the tail’s morphological transformation, {{and for the first}} time quantitatively evaluates its biomechanical consequences. We observe that both dorsoventral <b>and</b> <b>lateral</b> joint <b>stiffness</b> decreased along the non-avian theropod lineage (between nodes Theropoda and Paraves). Our results show how the tail structure of non-avian theropods was mechanically appropriate for holding itself up against gravity and maintaining passive balance. However, as dorsoventral <b>and</b> <b>lateral</b> joint <b>stiffness</b> decreased, the tail may have become more effective for dynamically maintaining balance. This supports our hypothesis of a reduction of dorsoventral <b>and</b> <b>lateral</b> joint <b>stiffness</b> in shorter tails. Along the avian theropod lineage (Avialae to crown group birds), dorsoventral <b>and</b> <b>lateral</b> joint <b>stiffness</b> increased overall, which appears to contradict our null expectation. We infer that this departure in joint stiffness is specific to the tail’s aerodynamic role and the functional constraints imposed by it. Increased dorsoventral <b>and</b> <b>lateral</b> joint <b>stiffness</b> may have facilitated a gradually improved capacity to lift, depress, and swing the tail. The associated morphological changes should have resulted in a tail capable of producing larger muscular forces to utilise larger lift forces in flight. Improved joint mobility i...|$|R

40|$|The {{horizontal}} {{interaction between the}} walls and frames in wall-frame structures is investigated to determine its role in stiffening the structure against lateral, wind or earthquake loading. Discontinuous wall-frame structures are studied to assess {{the effects of the}} discontinuities on the {{horizontal interaction}}, and on the structures' lateral stiffness. The discontinuities include stepped walls or frames, curtailed walls, and different configurations of stiffened-storey frames. In each case, a continuum solution is developed and used to describe the behaviour of the structure, and to evaluate the effects of the discontinuities. Corresponding discrete finite elements analyses are also performed to verify the accuracy of the algebraic solutions and to determine the nature and magnitude of the resulting effects. For stepped and curtailed wall-frame structures, it is found that the walls can be reduced or curtailed without modifying significantly the overall horizontal interaction <b>and</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>stiffness.</b> It is found that for stiffened-storey frame structures, the horizontal interaction <b>and</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>stiffness</b> are significantly increased.

Therefore, some strengthening works have to be carried out in order for these old bridges to work well. Among the common strengthening methods, an efficient way to transform a simply supported into a continuous system is widely used in simply supported bridges with small or medium span. After the transformation of the system, the internal forces in the bridge are redistributed. This paper investigated, using the FEM software ANSYS, both the endogen forces of an old T-type bridge transformed from a simply supported to a continuous system under vehicular load. The result of the analysis indicates that the flexural moments in mid-span of all lateral T beams are significantly decreased and negative moments at supports are formed, while the shear forces in controlling sections are increased that are required to be reinforced based on the computation. In addition, after transformation, both longitudinal <b>and</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> of T beams are improved that provides beneficial effects on the deflections of the bridge...|$|R
