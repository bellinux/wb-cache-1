Gail Murray in Boyhood in America called it [...] "moving" [...] and Children Experience Literature said it was a [...] "grimly realistic picture of warfare and its effect on both soldiers and civilians". According to the International Reading Association, while reading it [...] "children may be helped to understand that history is <b>always</b> <b>someone's</b> interpretation...

500|$|Victor Meldrew (Richard Wilson) – Victor is {{the main}} protagonist of the sitcom and finds himself {{constantly}} battling against all that life throws {{at him as he}} becomes entangled in complicated misfortunes and farcical situations. Renwick once pointed out in an interview that the name [...] "Victor" [...] was ironic, since he almost always ends up a loser. From being buried alive to being prosecuted for attacking a feisty pit bull terrier with a collection of coconut meringues, Victor tries to adjust to life after his infamous replacement by a [...] "box" [...] at his place of employment, but to no avail. He believes that everything is going wrong for him all the time, and he has the right to be upset because it is <b>always</b> <b>someone</b> else's fault. Victor is a tragic comedy character and sympathy is directed towards him as he becomes embroiled in complex misunderstandings, bureaucratic vanity and, at times, sheer bad luck. The audience sees a philosophical ebb to his character, however, along with a degree of optimism. Yet his polite façade collapses when events get the better of him, and a full verbal onslaught is forthcoming. [...] "Victor-isms" [...] include [...] "I do not believe it!", [...] "I don't believe it!", [...] "Un-be-lievable!", [...] "What in the name of bloody hell?", [...] "In the name of sanity!". Despite his grumpy demeanor Victor isn't totally devoid of compassionin [...] "Hearts of Darkness" [...] he liberates elderly nursing home residents that were being mistreated by the staff and in [...] "Descent Into The Maelstrom" [...] he calls the incident room number and gives the location of an emotionally disturbed girl that abducted a baby and stole Margaret's pearl earrings, which resulted in the girl getting picked up by the police. However, because the girl was a friend of Margaret's and knowing she meant a lot to her, Victor never said anything. Victor has also shown a vast amount of loyalty to Margaret as, throughout their entire 38 years of lifelong marriage together, not once has the thought of infidelity ever occurred to him. In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Victor and Margaret recollect the days of their courtship at a party after which Victor says [...] "You were always my first choice", which leaves Margaret stunned. In another episode, Margaret recounts the time Victor took her to the funfair and they ended up getting stuck in the hall of mirrors for over an hour. Victor had said he didn't mind as he was happy to stay there and look at all the reflections of her. Victor's very best act of compassion came in the episode [...] "The Wisdom of the Witch" [...] in which he ends up saving Patrick's life from his new secretary's psychopathic boyfriend by forcing Patrick's would-be murderer, with himself along with him as well, {{out the window of the}} house in which they were trapped during a snowstorm.|$|E

2500|$|Of the two, Zeca Afonso {{was more}} {{prolific}} and more {{identified with the}} movement, {{so much so that}} another of his songs was the first choice for the code [...] "Venham mais 5" [...] (Let 5 more come). Other artists also used some craft to hide their meanings in the song or went into exile. One example is Adriano Correia de Oliveira that masked the explicit lyrics with the vocal tone making it difficult to distinguish the critical verse, from the refrain or even other verses. In no other song is this more noted that the ballad [...] "Trova do Vento que Passa" [...] (Song/Poem of the Passing Wind), whose lyrics by the writer Manuel Alegre were a direct criticism of the state. The music was by António Portugal but Correia used a typical Fado rhythm to hide such provocative verses as [...] "Mesmo na noite mais triste/em tempo de sevidão/há sempre alguém que resiste/há sempre alguém que diz não" [...] (even in the saddest night/in time of servitude/there is <b>always</b> <b>someone</b> who stands up/there is <b>always</b> <b>someone</b> who says No).|$|E

During much of Alice's childhood, Bamie was a remote figure who eventually married and moved to London for a time. But later, as Alice became more independent and came into conflict with her father and stepmother, Aunt [...] "Bye" [...] provided needed structure and stability.

The car, a Ford Corsair, was destroyed, {{and one of its}} occupants had to be cut free, having been trapped by her feet, but was not seriously injured. The train driver, Cyril Carter, was uninjured. The occupants of the car were a local young brother and sister, Roger Piper (20) and Belinda Piper (14) driving to the fish and chip shop, and witnesses reported that they had seen the approaching train but tried to race it to the level crossing.

5000|$|Attributing {{meaning to}} {{something}} follows from sensing it, {{and is a}} prelude to action. [...] " [...] One always acts according {{to the meaning of}} whatever one faces [...] " [...] and the consequences of these actions in turn become part of the meanings of what one interacts with. Meanings are <b>always</b> <b>someone's</b> construction and depend on context and culture. The same artifact may invoke different meanings at different times, in different contexts of use, and for different people. To design artifacts for use by others calls on designers to understand the understanding of others, a second order understanding that is fundamentally unlike the understanding of physical things. Since meanings cannot be observed directly, designers need to carefully observe the actions that imply certain meanings; involve themselves in dialog with their stakeholders; and invite them to participate in the design process.|$|R

40|$|Fulford’s {{advocacy}} of ‘values-based practice’ is deeply puzzling; for although it purports {{to do justice}} to the full range of whatever values anyone concerned brings to the table, it in fact leaves conflicts between people’s values at best unresolved or, worse, simply ignored. The difficulty arises from two fundamental shortcomings. First, it is not remotely clear what he takes values actually to be; and in particular, how values can be based in skills, as though they were something instrumental rather than normative. What does it mean – indeed, what could it mean [...] to say that ‘Values-based practice is a new skills-based approach to working more effectively with complex and conflicting values’ (Fulford, 2011, 976) ? Second, values are <b>always</b> <b>someone’s</b> values; but Fulford’s proposal simply glosses over the problem of whose values ‘values-based practice’ is supposed to consist in, gesturing vaguely in the direction of liberalism, as if that were something both fairly simply given and normatively uncontroversial...|$|R
