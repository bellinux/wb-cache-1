5|$|There {{is no good}} {{biography}} of Trimmer. Many of the same details of her life, drawn primarily from the account of her life <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> journal, written by one of her children, are repeated in Balfour, Grenby, Rodgers, Schnorrenberg, Wills and Yarde.|$|E
5|$|Isabel Macedo {{had played}} several villains, {{including}} in Floricienta, {{and took the}} Patricia Longo-Jimena Benitez role because it was something she had not done before. Although Patricia's past identity as Jimena {{was intended to be}} a secret for only ten episodes, Macedo insisted that the mystery should be maintained for a longer time. She read about victims of school bullying to inform her character and declined other work during the year to stay focused on the series, becoming emotionally <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> character.|$|E

50|$|The species {{displays}} extreme sexual dimorphism. Females {{are more}} typical in appearance to other anglerfishes, whereas the males are tiny rudimentary creatures with stunted digestive systems. A male {{must find a}} female and <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> near the vent; he then lives on her parasitically, becoming {{little more than a}} sperm-producing appendage.|$|R
5|$|Keeler {{found it}} {{difficult}} to escape the negative image <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> by press, law and parliament throughout the Profumo affair. In various, sometimes contradictory accounts, she has challenged Denning's conclusions relating to security issues. Ward's conviction has been described by analysts as an act of Establishment revenge, rather than serving justice. In January 2014 his case was under review by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, with the possibility of a later reference to the Court of Appeal. Dramatisations of the Profumo affair have been shown on stage and screen.|$|E
5|$|Saxobeats was commercialized {{with three}} {{different}} covers shot by Andrei Nemirschi. For European standard releases, it featured Stan wearing a bob {{in front of a}} black-white backdrop, with one of her hands being <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> head. In Japan, the release was accompanied by a photograph of the singer standing with headphones on her shoulders against a black background. All deluxe editions featured Stan leaning on a plastic mannequin, sporting a blue blouse along with various accessories on her hand.|$|E
5|$|As the town, where Hamasaki {{is sitting}} on the bench, starts to rain, the {{atmosphere}} where Hamasaki is the doll starts to rain as well. Just after Hamasaki finishes singing the second chorus, an instrumental break happens and has Hamasaki looking at the now abandoned puppet show. A truck then drives past, which vibrates the puppet show's stage, causing the doll to fall on the ground and its strings become tangled. This happens to Hamasaki as the doll; she faints in the dark atmosphere land, with strings <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Hamasaki, sitting on the bench, starts to cry and sings the remaining of the song. It ends with the taxi driver, who finishes day dreaming about the marionettes dolls, opening the door for Hamasaki to enter.|$|E

60|$|When {{she touched}} {{the surface of the}} river she must have been going twenty or thirty miles an hour. Her {{momentum}} carried her well out into the stream, until she came to a sudden halt {{at the end of the}} long line which we had had the foresight <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> bow and fasten to a large tree upon the bank.|$|R
50|$|Back in Earth, she is {{attacked}} by the assassin Lobo, and in the ensuing battle, kills him, while unleashing her rage. A Red Lantern power ring finds <b>her</b> and <b>attaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> transforming her into a Red Lantern. Driven insane by rage, Kara wanders space, attacking everyone in her way, until captured by several Green Lanterns and brought to Hal Jordan. Immediately recognizing a Kryptonian and unable to remove the power ring without killing her, he brings <b>her</b> <b>to</b> Guy Gardner, the leader {{of one of the}} two Red Lantern factions, who manages <b>to</b> restore <b>her</b> sanity.|$|R
5|$|Elizabeth {{was still}} <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> old friend when Mary Dudley left {{the court in}} July 1579because of bad health, or out of {{solidarity}} with her brother Robert, Earl of Leicester, who was in disgrace for having married. She joined her husband at Ludlow in 1582, where he was serving his third turn as President of the Council of Wales. A year later her health {{was in such a}} state that Henry Sidney believed he would soon have the opportunity to take a second wife. Mary Dudley died on 9August 1586, three months after her husband, in whose elaborate funeral she had participated. She was buried by his side at Penshurst.|$|E
5|$|Izsha is a zerg advisor {{in service}} to Sarah Kerrigan. She is a unique type of zerg; one of a kind. Izsha exemplifies a {{midpoint}} for Kerrigan, standing between Kerrigan's cold rationality and the feral nature of the Swarm. She harkens back to {{the ideology of the}} Overmind, but is still a rational individual. In earlier times, Kerrigan used her to store her thoughts and plans. On at least one occasion she entrusted Izsha with a plan to infest a planet using the hyper-evolutionary virus through its water supply. Izsha reunited with Kerrigan following the latter's de-infestation and subsequent return to the Swarm. She served as an advisor, recalling memories from Kerrigan's time as the Queen of Blades, and helping her to reclaim the Swarm while remaining <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> queen's leviathan.|$|E
5|$|The {{most likely}} {{cause of the}} {{accident}} {{seemed to be that}} the fireworks <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> balloon had been knocked out of position by a tree as she ascended; possibly the balloon was heavily loaded and failed to rise quickly enough. When she had lit the fuses the fireworks headed towards the balloon instead of away from it; one of them burned a hole in the fabric, igniting the gas. One man reportedly spotted the problem and shouted to her not to light the fuses, but his cries were drowned out by the cheering of the crowd. Later reports suggested she had left the gas valve open, allowing sparks to ignite the gas and set fire to the balloon, or that her balloon was of poor construction and allowed gas to escape throughout the ascent.|$|E
50|$|Arriving home, Buffy {{sees her}} egg hatching. Suddenly a {{creature}} emerges and attempts <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> itself <b>to</b> <b>her</b> body. Buffy finally manages to stab {{it with a}} pair of scissors, before phoning Willow <b>to</b> warn <b>her.</b> Willow assures Buffy that she is fine, but her egg is seen to already be hatched. The next day, a creature is seen <b>to</b> have <b>attached</b> itself <b>to</b> Willow's back. Xander, who has hard-boiled his egg, decides to eat it, only to find a dead creature inside. The Scooby Gang proceed to the science lab to dissect the creature. However, Cordelia's egg hatches and the creature <b>attaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> instructing <b>her</b> <b>to</b> knock Buffy unconscious, while Willow hits Xander over the head with a microscope. They drag Buffy and Xander to a closet, before joining a large group of students who pick up tools and head into the basement.|$|R
50|$|The {{alter ego}} of Yuu Takanashi. Her {{thematic}} food is cherries, thus she gains {{a pair of}} high tech machines that look like cherries. She uses them as bomb launchers. Unlike the others, she has no rabbit tail, rather the cherry-weapons <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> head band. Her Miina costume is a school uniform with a jacket, red jet pack, and dress shoes. She is shown to echo Minazuki Miina's overall appearance.|$|R
60|$|It {{was easy}} to {{differentiate}} their attitudes toward this party. Sally wanted to look beautiful, to excell all the young ladies who were <b>to</b> attend, <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> train all the young men, and have them fighting <b>to</b> dance with <b>her.</b> Miss Sampson had an earnest desire <b>to</b> open <b>her</b> father's house <b>to</b> the people of Linrock, {{to show that a}} daughter had come into his long cheerless home, to make the evening one of pleasure and entertainment.|$|R
5|$|A casting {{call was}} {{announced}} by Suresh Productions for {{the roles of}} Venkatesh's daughters in the film. They {{were looking for a}} girl aged 14–17 years {{to play the role of}} the elder daughter named Anjali, and another aged 8–12 years to play her younger sibling, Anu. Esther Anil was confirmed to reprise her role as the younger sister. Kruthika Jayakumar, a 17-year-old science student from Bangalore, was selected to play the role of elder sister in the film. This happened when a Malayalam filmmaker visited her dance performance in Thiruvananthapuram, and was struck by her expressions and photogenic features. He suggested that she pursue a career in the film industry. She referred to her character as a simple and vulnerable girl, who gets exploited. Her family is her world and she is particularly <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> father. Kalabhavan Shajon was initially reported to reprise his role of a corrupt police officer from the original, but Ravi Kale was chosen instead.|$|E
5|$|Laura finds Nicky on a {{basement}} table with hoses <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> pumping bile into her body until she explodes. The Boogeyman chases Laura through the hospital; {{along the way}} she finds Gloria's body and Dr. Ryan, barely alive and mumbling in a trance-like state. She also runs into Dr. Allen, who believes Laura committed the killings. He tries to sedate her, but is stopped by the Boogeyman, who stabs him and shoves two needles into his eyes. The Boogeyman is revealed to be Henry; Dr. Allen had locked him in a closet {{in an attempt to}} treat him of his bogyphobia, and the Boogeyman possessed Henry at that time. The chase ends when Laura decapitates the Boogeyman with gardening shears. The police arrive and discover that under the Boogeyman mask was Dr. Ryan; after killing Dr. Allen but prior to chasing Laura, Henry put the mask on the doctor and escaped. Laura realizes that Henry is running free and is arrested for the murder of Dr. Ryan.|$|E
5|$|On 8 August 1993, Mills and Mincione {{walked to}} the corner of De Vere Gardens and Kensington Road, London, but while {{crossing}} Kensington Road, Mills was knocked down by a police motorcycle, the last in a convoy of three, which was responding to an emergency call. Mills suffered crushed ribs, a punctured lung, and the loss of her left leg 6inches below the knee; a metal plate was later <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> pelvis. In October 1993, she had another operation that further shortened her leg. Mills was awarded £200,000 by the police authority as recompense for her injuries, even though the police motorcyclist, PC Osbourne, was later cleared by magistrates of driving without due care and attention. After the accident, Mills sold her story to the News of the World, and gave other interviews, saying she earned £180,000. She used the money to set up the Heather Mills Health Trust (existed 2000–2004) which delivered prosthetic limbs to people, particularly children, who had lost limbs after stepping on landmines. Mills often shows people her prosthetic leg, once taking it off during an interview on the American talk show Larry King Live, in 2002.|$|E

5|$|The parishes {{were grouped}} into deaneries called Varados. Every parish {{was divided into}} wards, while Parish Councils were present in most parishes. About 15 percent of the {{households}} in the parishes were literate. A widow had to remain indoors, practically {{for the rest of}} her life. Since high-caste Hindu widows cannot remarry after the death of their husbands, the high-caste Christians too considered the remarriage of a widow as something unnatural. Canon law did allow remarriage for widows and therefore there was no direct prohibition for widows to remarry in the society of the Christians of South Canara. Few women had the courage to go against the strict conventions of their community. A widow who remarried was looked down upon, pitied, and shunned as unlucky. But she was not ill-treated or made an outcast, and no stigma was <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> husband. Succession to property was practised as per the Hindu laws.|$|E
5|$|With the {{beginning}} of the second verse, Madonna moves into her bedroom, wearing a very feminine lingerie looking outfit. She moves behind different white screens and dances in suggestive manner, her silhouette reflecting it {{from the other side of}} the screens. In the meantime the worker continues to think about Madonna's voice and dreams of her eyes amidst smokes. He then sees Madonna standing atop a long flight of stairs inside the factory, wearing a pinstripe suit and displaying a monocle glass. She dances on a platform, holding her crotch sometimes, and briefly tears open her jacket to exposes her bra, as two men pull at levers beside the steps. In the meantime, the owner of the factory listens to live musicians in his room, with a remote control, as Madonna is shown lying naked on her bed, with one end of a chain <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> neck, the other end going long down into the factory. As the owner leers at the musicians in the room, the worker is shown caressing Madonna's cat, while looking up expectantly towards her room. Perhaps the owner in a suit is Madonna's husband and she is trying to escape him.|$|E

If he dies before her, some culpability is <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> for his death, as not having been sufficiently protective of him. Making the vow to burn alive beside him removes her own culpability, {{as well as}} within the afterlife, enables her {{to protect him from}} new dangers.|$|E
