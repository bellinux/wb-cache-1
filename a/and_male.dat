5|$|After the Japanese {{surrender}} in 1945, Japanese settlers were repatriated back to Japan, <b>and</b> <b>male</b> Japanese settlers who {{had raised}} Japanese-Palauan families abandoned {{their families in}} favour of repatriation, reasoning that the offspring {{would be able to}} better adapt in Palau than in Japan. Many of these Palauan women raised their mixed-race children singlehandedly, while others were abandoned and adopted by Palauan families. Some Japanese-Palauan families migrated to Japan, but generally faced a cultural shock and petitioned to return to Palau after living in Japan for some years. Most petitions were allowed, although they were not allowed to bring their Japanese spouses along.|$|E

40|$|This study {{attempted}} {{to explore the}} representation of gender in an international ELT series, i. e., American Headway Student Textbooks. Fairclough’s (2001) three-dimensional model was selected and adopted as the model of study. Effectively, different parts of American Headway Student Textbooks were investigated systematically vis-à-vis eight factors, i. e. female <b>and</b> <b>male's</b> characters, female <b>and</b> <b>male’s</b> social roles, female <b>and</b> <b>male’s</b> domestic roles, female <b>and</b> <b>male’s</b> semantic roles, female <b>and</b> <b>male’s</b> titles, order of appearance, masculine generic construction, activities females <b>and</b> <b>males</b> engaged in, <b>and</b> finally the pictorial representation of both genders. The findings of the study revealed that the series are suffering from two types of sexism—overt and covert ones—the overt one discriminates against females in a vivid way and the covert one exploits the women as an instrument for advertising {{in order to promote}} selling. This study suggests that the series are instilling capitalism economy as ideology...|$|R

5|$|All species {{within the}} wolf-like canids possess 78 {{chromosomes}} {{and therefore can}} potentially interbreed. Genetic analysis reveals that hybridization takes place between gray wolves and jackals, creating a jackal-wolf hybrid. Hybridization also occurs between female golden jackals <b>and</b> <b>male</b> dogs, which produces fertile offspring, a jackal–dog hybrid. There was 11%–13% of ancient gene flow into the golden jackal from the population that was ancestral to wolves and dogs, and an additional 3% contributed from extant wolf populations. Up to 15% of the Israeli wolf genome is derived from admixure with golden jackals in ancient times.|$|E

5|$|Briarcliff Manor is {{primarily}} non-commercial, with over 80percent of village land residential. Approximately 99% {{of the buildings}} are residential; of these, 85.3% are single-family units. In the 2010 United States Census there were 7,867 people, 2,647 households, and 2,037 families living in 2,753 housing units. Hispanic and Latino Americans made up 5.3percent of the population. Of the 2,647 households, 39.7percent had children under age 18 living with them; 68.5percent were married couples living together, 6.6percent were headed by women, 1.9percent were single males and 23percent were non-families. Twenty-one percent of all households were individuals, with 14.1percent age 65 or older. Average household size was 2.71; average family size was 3.16, with a median age of 43.4years. The 2015 American Community Survey (ACS) reported an estimated 2,636 households, 50 of which were held by unmarried partners. 34 of these were female householder <b>and</b> <b>male</b> partner households and 16 were male householder <b>and</b> <b>male</b> partner households.

5|$|Experiments {{confirming}} {{the role of}} kin selection in worker policing demonstrate the effects of multiple matings, {{which can lead to}} lower average relatedness between workers.

After controlling for the absolute number of eggs laid, these scientists conclude that the queen's multiple matings favor mutual worker policing.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether the clinical assessment of the pelvic-hip complex muscle and trunk flexibility is sufficient for diagnosing generalized joint hypermobility (GJH). A cross-sectional study. Center of Body Posture in Olsztyn, North East Poland. The study included 136 females <b>and</b> 113 <b>males</b> aged 10 - 13 years. In order to assess muscle flexibility, the straight leg raise (SLR) test (for hamstring) and modified Thomas test for one- (O-JHF) and two-joint (T-JHF) hip flexors were performed. To evaluate trunk flexibility the fingertip-to-floor (FTF) and lateral trunk flexion (LTF) tests were used. The GJH occurrence was assessed with the use of nine-point Beighton scale (threshold value ≥ 5 points for females, ≥ 4 for males). The analysis was carried out separately for females <b>and</b> <b>males.</b> There were no significant differences between females with versus without GJH, <b>and</b> <b>males</b> with versus without GJH regarding SLR (p = 0. 86, p = 0. 19 for females <b>and</b> <b>males,</b> respectively), O-JHF (p = 0. 89, p = 0. 35 for females <b>and</b> <b>males,</b> respectively), T-JHF (p = 0. 77, p = 0. 4 for females <b>and</b> <b>males,</b> respectively), FTF (p = 0. 19, p = 0. 84 for females <b>and</b> <b>males,</b> respectively) <b>and</b> LTF (p = 0. 58, p = 0. 35 for females <b>and</b> <b>males,</b> respectively) tests results. Clinical examination of the pelvic-hip complex muscles and trunk flexibility by use of SLR, O-JHF, T-JHF, FTF and LTF revealed to be insufficient in diagnosing GJH in children aged 10 - 13 years. Thus, the Beighton scale should be considered a standard element of physiotherapeutic examination of the musculoskeletal system in children and youth...|$|R
