5|$|Romanticism {{began to}} subside as <b>a</b> <b>movement</b> <b>in</b> the 1830s, but it {{continued}} to significantly affect areas such as music until the early twentieth century. It also had a lasting impact {{on the nature of}} Scottish identity and outside perceptions of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|In Haydn's {{previous}} {{two sets of}} quartets, the Opus 20 ("Sun") and Opus 33 ("Russian"), he adopted a variety of cyclical structures, particularly in the alternate placement of the slow movement as {{the second or third}} movement. But in the Opus 50 set, each quartet follows the same fast–slow–minuet–fast sequence. The set is also characterised by a high degree of monothematicism (the use of a single theme within <b>a</b> <b>movement).</b> <b>In</b> a number of movements, including sonata form movements and minuets and trios, Haydn eschews presenting a second and contrasting theme and instead elects to explore the full potential of the primary theme.|$|E

5|$|Opposition {{leader and}} then-mayor of Antananarivo, Andry Rajoelina, led <b>a</b> <b>movement</b> <b>in</b> early 2009 in which Ravalomanana was pushed from power in an unconstitutional process widely {{condemned}} as a coup d'état. In March 2009, Rajoelina was declared by the Supreme Court as the President of the High Transitional Authority, an interim governing body responsible for moving the country toward presidential elections. In 2010, {{a new constitution}} was adopted by referendum, establishing a Fourth Republic, which sustained the democratic, multi-party structure established in the previous constitution. Hery Rajaonarimampianina was declared {{the winner of the}} 2013 presidential election, which the international community deemed fair and transparent.|$|E
5|$|The Restaurant {{was later}} {{seen as the}} start of <b>a</b> <b>movement</b> <b>in</b> London wherein {{high-end}} restaurants were moved into hotels. This was followed in 1999 by Koffman moving La Tante Claire from its Royal Hospital Road location into The Berkeley hotel. The Restaurant's location in a hotel was {{thought at the time}} to have changed the mantra of not eating in a hotel-based restaurant to one where it was more openly acceptable.|$|E
5|$|The {{meetings}} {{he attended}} {{in his early}} life {{were a part of}} <b>a</b> <b>movement</b> <b>in</b> the study of botany by artisans. This had been initiated by George Caley, James Crowther, John Dewhurst, John Mellor and Edward Hobson, the last of whom Horsefield met in 1809 at a meeting held at Radcliffe Bridge and whose knowledge he held in high regard. It was part of a broader working class movement involving the study of nature and natural history that developed in the late 18th century and continued into the next.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, Public Enemy {{released}} {{their second}} album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back to critical and commercial success. Their music's dense textures, {{provided by the}} group's production team The Bomb Squad, exemplified a new production aesthetic in hip hop at the time. The controversial, politically charged lyrics by the group's lead rapper Chuck D, whose braggadocio raps contained references to political figures such as Assata Shakur and Nelson Mandela, as well as endorsements of Nation of Islam-leader Louis Farrakhan, intensified the group's affiliation with black nationalism and Farrakhan. It Takes a Nations success helped raise hip hop's profile as both art and sociopolitical statement, amid media criticism of the genre. It helped give hip hop a critical credibility and standing in the popular music community after it had been largely dismissed as a fad since its introduction {{at the turn of}} the 1980s. In promoting the record, Public Enemy expanded their live shows and performing dynamic. With the album's content and the group's rage-filled showmanship in concert, they became the vanguard of <b>a</b> <b>movement</b> <b>in</b> hip hop that reflected a new black consciousness and socio-political dynamic that were taking shape in America at the time.|$|E
5|$|Intergem {{rocked the}} gem trade by {{marketing}} the Yogo as the world's only guaranteed untreated sapphire. By 1982, {{the practice of}} routinely heat treating gems had become {{a major issue in}} the industry. At the time, 95percent of all the world's sapphires were being heated to enhance their natural color. Thai traders had even purchased large quantities of naturally colorless Sri Lankan sapphires, known as geuda, and heated them to an artificial blue. A problem with the practice was that heated gems often fade over time, though trained gemologists can detect a heated gem with 95percent accuracy. Intergem's marketing of guaranteed untreated Yogos set them against many in the gem industry. In 1985 there was <b>a</b> <b>movement</b> <b>in</b> Pennsylvania to require disclosure that a gem had been treated. Intergem's strategy resulted in large numbers of gem professionals visiting Yogo Gulch.|$|E
5|$|Little {{thought was}} given to the Chinese {{reaction}} to the Open Door note; the Chinese minister in Washington, Wu Ting-fang, did not learn of it until he read of it in the newspapers. Among those in China who opposed Western influence there was <b>a</b> <b>movement</b> <b>in</b> Shantung Province, in the north, that became known as the Fists of Righteous Harmony, or Boxers, after the martial arts they practiced. The Boxers were especially angered by missionaries and their converts. As late as June 1900, Rockhill dismissed the Boxers, contending that they would soon disband. By the middle of that month, the Boxers, joined by imperial troops, had cut the railroad between Peking and the coast, killed many missionaries and converts, and besieged the foreign legations. Hay faced a precarious situation; how to rescue the Americans trapped in Peking, and how to avoid giving the other powers an excuse to partition China, in an election year when there was already Democrat opposition to what they deemed American imperialism.|$|E

5|$|The {{new school}} of hip hop was <b>a</b> <b>movement</b> <b>in</b> hip hop music {{starting}} 1983–84 {{with the early}} records of Run–D.M.C. and LL Cool J. Like the hip hop preceding it, it came predominantly from New York City. The new school was initially characterized in form by drum machine led minimalism, often tinged with elements of rock. It was notable for taunts and boasts about rapping, and socio-political commentary, both delivered in an aggressive, self-assertive style. In image as in song its artists projected a tough, cool, street b-boy attitude. These elements contrasted sharply with the funk and disco influenced outfits, novelty hits, live bands, synthesizers and party rhymes of artists prevalent in 1984, and rendered them old school. New school artists made shorter songs that could more easily gain radio play, and more cohesive LPs than their old school counterparts. By 1986 their releases began to establish the hip hop album as a fixture of the mainstream.|$|E
5|$|There was <b>a</b> <b>movement</b> <b>in</b> {{the late}} nineteenth century to {{interpret}} all the Boeotian heroes as merely personifications of the constellations; there has since come to be wide agreement that the myth of Orion existed before there was a constellation named for him. Homer, for example, mentions Orion, the Hunter, and Orion, the constellation, but never confuses the two. Once Orion was recognized as a constellation, astronomy in turn affected the myth. The story of Side may well be a piece of astronomical mythology. The Greek word side means pomegranate, which bears fruit while Orion, the constellation, {{can be seen in the}} night sky. Rose suggests she is connected with Sidae in Boeotia, and that the pomegranate, as a sign of the Underworld, is connected with her descent there.|$|E
