40|$|The thesis {{considers}} {{the argument that}} industrial sociologists have acted as "servants of power". In order to examine this, the diffusion and use of a specific idea - autonomous work groups - was investigated. On examining the origin and potentials of the concept, {{it was concluded that}} the idea of autonomous work groups was potentially radical for the organisation of work. Much attention was found to have been devoted to the <b>autonomous</b> <b>work</b> <b>group</b> in publications, but the notion tended to be de-radicalised. The ways in which this (and similar ideas) reach managers in industry were examined through the activities of 'linkers' - journalists, information-giving organisations, consultants (both academic and commercial), industrial training boards and authors. The mechanics and factors influencing the diffusion of ideas to industry were examined through the study of a specific industry: brewing. It was found that managers neither highly rated, nor actively sought, ideas emanating from industrial sociologists; indeed, they were often antagonistic. Academics were seldom found to have any obvious role in the diffusion of industrial sociology to those in industry. Industrial sociologists are not 'servants of power': the notion is both too simplistic and naive. It is in the nature of our society that the presentation of ideas enhances the existing social order...|$|E
40|$|Les auteurs cherchent à approfondir l'analyse du problèmede la différenciation interne aux travailleurs en {{situation}} de changement organisationnel. This {{article is}} based on the analysis of different reactions observed among workers of a semi-autonomous work group, operating for eight years, particularly regarding key aspects of this organizational change. At the time of the empirical research, social relations among workers were conflictual and tense. In this paper, the authors develop an analytical framework for the study of this problem of internal social differentiation, which has generally not been investigated in the literature on semi-autonomous groups. According to this framework, it is hypothesized that this kind of social differentiation and conflict among workers members of the work group depends on factors related to the organizational context, the work organization and Personal characteristics of the workers. The empirical evidence shows that {{in the first years of}} the project, the <b>autonomous</b> <b>work</b> <b>group</b> had been creative and rather cohesive regarding key aspects of the experience, such as: job rotation, the decision-making process, the payment system and supervision. However, at the time of the empirical research (eight years after the beginning of this organizational change), the work group appeared divided and lacking in cohesiveness. In fact, three subgroups were identified within the work group, having very different attitudes towards such aspects as productivity, discipline and job rotation. In this article, the authors describe these attitudes and try to explain why members of the work group evolved so differently. The three subgroups are a minority of leaders, another minority of restricters and, between them, the majority of the workers who had silently followed the leaders at the beginning but now hold a different view of the work groups future. While the leaders are pushing to attain higher group productivity and self-discipline, it appears that the restricters overtly opposed the leaders, criticizing almost every aspect of the new work organization, and trying to do the least possible work. The majority of the workers nevertheless, are satisfied with the present state of affairs and trying to stabilize and institutionalize the work group formula. Within the analytical framework proposed, the authors explain the differences observed among workers by a set of factors. First of all, there are significant differences between subgroups concerning personal characteristics of their members, such as seniority and career expectations. Secondly, it appears that subgroups are influenced by some characteristics of the organizational context such as: the company's initial plan to extend the work group formula to other departments, the presence of a union, the rules of the collective contract and the established pattern for labour relations. The authors conclude that the evolution of this <b>autonomous</b> <b>work</b> <b>group</b> is largely opposed to what could have been anticipated from a socio-technical point of view. Based on socio-technical approach, autonomous work groups are supposed to evolve towards more and more internal integration, unless external factors keep them from doing so. The present research shows that that has not been the case here. The work group has evolved towards more and more internal differentiation and a reduced cohesiveness. Moreover, the empirical evidence shows the prominent influence of personal characteristics of the work group's members as the determinant factor in the explanation of such an evolution. In fact, this case study calls for a more strategic approach to the autonomous work group's dynamics...|$|E

Even though <b>work</b> <b>groups</b> are generally assumed {{to have a positive}} effect on the psychological well-being of employees, little empirical research addresses this assumption. The current study was intended as a contribution to this area of research. By means of a questionnaire survey we investigated three main hypotheses.

Second, we expected group autonomy to be positively related to two characteristics of the individual tasks of team members, being individual autonomy and individual task variety; and to the quality of social relationships among team members. Group autonomy was expected to be related negatively to individual workload. Third, we expected individual autonomy; individual task variety and the quality of social relationships among team members to be positively related to psychological well-being, while individual workload was expected to be negatively related to psychological well-being.

40|$|AbstractTutoring is a methodological {{element of}} utmost {{importance}} in the EHEA (European Higher Education Area) context. Academic tutoring at university-level must offer counselling and technical support to university students in the three following areas: academic, professional and personal.

Nevertheless, its potential is very often overshadowed due to the general lack of awareness (here we must place responsibility on the teacher-student relationship) of its methodological function in the teaching proposal required by the EHEA, whose organizational model {{is focused on the}} acquisition of competencies. A Formative Assessment applied model in university subjects, in which the teacher becomes tutor of <b>autonomous</b> <b>work</b> <b>groups</b> and that proposes the use of well-organised academic tutoring sessions, is proposed on this contribution. The result, after introducing this model in the classroom, is very positive in several aspects, since it contributes to the development of instrumental, interpersonal and systematic competencies.

Using French employment relations survey data (REPONSE), they analyze the empirical relevance of socio-productive organizational models in light of three dimensions: work organization, human resource management (HRM), and industrial relations. Results indicate the emergence of two “innovative” models: the “Toyotist” model, featuring just-in-time organizational methods, innovative HRM systems, high employee participation, and low union presence; and the “neo-Taylorist” model, featuring low innovation, low investment in HRM, strict managerial control with minimal employee participation, and average union presence.

In fact, the discipline and art of recording is itself an important contribution to social science methodology (so well discussed in Lynton, 1998, chap. 3, pp. 85 - 111), which many have followed and benefited from. Most of Rolf’s contributions have come from his hands-on experiences; he is a reflective practitioner in the true sense. His deep involvement in action, and his daily recording of experience, especially interpersonal interaction, led to the development of theories, later buttressed with readings, for adequate explanation of the experiences. His early work on strikes in the London docks led him to realize that “the situation in the docks needs to be studied rather than the strikes ” (Lynton & King, 1949).

40|$|The {{author would}} like to thank the human {{resource}} managers of the three manufacturing companies that were studied for their kind gestures and their supply of data concerning organizational structure and functioning. Purpose – The overall purpose of this paper is to explain theoretically the autonomy phenomenon of teams working within the auto manufacturing context and its implications for the technical and social aspects of <b>group</b> <b>work.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Three auto component companies were studied. The procedures of a qualitative methodology were followed, adopting naturalistic observation techniques of work teams, and unstructured and semi-structured interviews conducted with operators, supervisors and middle managers. To analyse and interpret the qualitative data obtained, the grounded theory technique was used. Findings – In this paper 33 concepts were obtained, which resulted from the constant comparative method applied to data. The relationships between those concepts allowed the construction of a theoretical model that is settled in the “bridge” concept. This “bridge” is a metaphor that translates the process which binds operational <b>work</b> <b>group</b> goals to the needs of external clients. This process is supported by social aspects – team decision making, participation, mutual helpfulness, and social and emotional relationships, and by technical aspects – operations and information. The bridge has four pillars that are critical to the effective functioning of self-directed teams: team facilitation, hierarchical relationships established within the teams, quality of manufactured components, and productivity achieved. Research limitations/implications – The present investigation was carried out in a specific industry, which does not allow for the generalization of the model to other industries. Furthermore, it may be questioned whether the same results be obtained if the operators of the teams observed were interviewed, not individually, but in a group situation. Other kinds of research design and other industries organized on the basis of <b>autonomous</b> <b>work</b> <b>groups</b> must be studied, applying the grounded theory technique, in order to compare diverse theoretical models. Practical implications – The organization of the industrial automotive production based on self-directed teams, which know the needs of external customers and to whom a high level of participation in operational decisions was given, can generate a substantial increase of working groups' efficiency and an increase in job satisfaction. Originality/value – The study of teams in the automotive components industry – in a southern country of Europe – and the consequent elaboration of a specific theoretical model draws attention to the need for social research that takes into account the fact that realities are constructed by the actors who interact in a certain context. No theoretical model can ever encompass the reality of all contexts...|$|R

[...] Park concludes, [...] "despite Janis' claim that group cohesiveness is the major necessary antecedent factor, no research has showed {{a significant main effect}} of cohesiveness on groupthink." [...] Park also concludes that research on the interaction between group cohesiveness and leadership style does not support Janis' claim that cohesion and leadership style interact to produce groupthink symptoms. Park presents a summary {{of the results of the}} studies analyzed. According to Park, a study by Huseman and Drive (1979) indicates groupthink occurs in both small and large decision-making groups within businesses. This results partly from group isolation within the business. Manz and Sims (1982) conducted a study showing that <b>autonomous</b> <b>work</b> <b>groups</b> are susceptible to groupthink symptoms in the same manner as decisions making groups within businesses. Fodor and Smith (1982) produced a study revealing that group leaders with high power motivation create atmospheres more susceptible to groupthink. Leaders with high power motivation possess characteristics similar to leaders with a [...] "closed" [...] leadership style—an unwillingness to respect dissenting opinion. The same study indicates that level of group cohesiveness is insignificant in predicting groupthink occurrence. Park summarizes a study performed by Callaway, Marriott, and Esser (1985) in which groups with highly dominant members [...] "made higher quality decisions, exhibited lowered state of anxiety, took more time to reach a decision, and made more statements of disagreement/agreement." [...] Overall, groups with highly dominant members expressed characteristics inhibitory to groupthink. If highly dominant members are considered equivalent to leaders with high power motivation, the results of Callaway, Marriott, and Esser contradict the results of Fodor and Smith. A study by Leana (1985) indicates the interaction between level of group cohesion and leadership style is completely insignificant in predicting groupthink. This finding refutes Janis' claim that the factors of cohesion and leadership style interact to produce groupthink. Park summarizes a study by McCauley (1989) in which structural conditions of the group were found to predict groupthink while situational conditions did not. The structural conditions included group insulation, group homogeneity, and promotional leadership. The situational conditions included group cohesion. These findings refute Janis' claim about group cohesiveness predicting groupthink.|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether <b>autonomous</b> motivation for <b>work</b> can explain the distinctive associations between hindrance and challenge demands and work-related well-being (i. e., positive affect and work engagement) on a within-person level. <b>Autonomous</b> <b>work</b> motivation represents the degree to which motivation for putting effort in work is intrinsic (i. e., with a sense of volition and personal choice) or has been internalized (i. e., without feelings of internal or external pressure). In order to test our hypotheses, we employed a diary methodology and followed 153 secondary school teachers throughout five consecutive working days. The results of multilevel modelling provided support for the hypothesized research model. On days when teachers experienced more challenges, they also experienced more positive affect and more engagement in their work on the same day, and this relationship could be explained by (higher) <b>autonomous</b> <b>work</b> motivation on that day. In contrast, on days when teachers experienced more hindrance demands, they experienced less positive affect and less work engagement, and this process was explained by (reduced) <b>autonomous</b> <b>work</b> motivation that day.

40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} based on a {{large-scale}} research project concerning a task-based blended language learning programme for Business English undergraduate students in a university in France. The programme combines two hours of face-to-face teaching with 2 - 3 hours of <b>autonomous</b> <b>group</b> <b>work</b> and asynchronous computer-mediated communication. The design of the programme was grounded in a socio-constructivist and cognitivist approach to language learning and based on a number of guiding TBLT principles. Accordingly, the programme proposes complex social tasks which foster student interaction and collaboration and a shift from traditional teacher-directed instruction to autonomous student-centred learning. After briefly outlining the theoretical underpinnings of the programme, this paper presents and discusses the results of a three year evaluation examining how these principles translated into practice for the students. User acceptance and adoption of the programme were deemed critical to its successful implementation. Our study, therefore, investigated students' representations relating to the underlying principles and assumptions of the blended language learning programme including the role of the teacher, second language acquisition, the role of technology in language learning, autonomy and <b>group</b> <b>work.</b> It is held that these representations will greatly impact students' actions and behaviour, and consequently their use of the blended learning system.
