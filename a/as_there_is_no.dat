5|$|Author John Macklin {{includes}} an account in his 1965 book, Strange Destinies, of two green children {{who arrived in}} the Spanish village of Banjos in 1887. Many details of the story very closely resemble the accounts given of the Woolpit children, such as the name of Ricardo de Calno, the mayor of Banjos who befriends the two children, strikingly similar to Richard de Calne. It therefore seems that Macklin's story is an invention inspired by the green children of Woolpit, particularly <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> record of any Spanish village called Banjos.|$|E
5|$|By definition, modern {{democratic}} constitutional monarchies are parliamentary, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> elected head {{of state}} who could assume non-ceremonial competences; of the twenty one republican member states of the European Union, only one is a presidential republic (Cyprus) and five are semi-presidential republics (France, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal and Romania). These six (semi-)presidential republics elect their president by direct popular vote. Among the fourteen parliamentary republics, half do the same (namely Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Finland, Ireland, Slovakia and Slovenia), whereas in the remaining seven (Estonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia and Malta), the president is elected by parliament or other special representative body such as the German Bundesversammlung.|$|E

5|$|Elu Suttina Kote (1987 Kannada film {{starring}} Ambareesh, Ramesh Aravind and Gautami Tadimalla), an Indian Kannada-language film {{which is}} primarily {{based on the}} novel. Few differences can be noted such as the lead actor wants to surrender to police however is said persuaded by his lover {{not to do so}} <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> evidence. In the climax, the lead actor goes running himself to the police when he sees him on the way promising her that he will return with a clear conscience. Although this was an intellectual film with good expectations, it did not see huge commercial success as other films where Ambareesh was the lead actor.|$|E
