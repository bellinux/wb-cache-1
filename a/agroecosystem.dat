40|$|ABSTRACT. Managing human-dominated landscapes such as <b>agroecosystems</b> {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{challenges}} facing society today. Decisions about land-use management in <b>agroecosystems</b> involve spatial and temporal trade-offs. The key scales at which these trades-offs occur are poorly understood for most systems, and quantitative assessments of the services provided by <b>agroecosystems</b> under different combinations of land uses are rare. To fill these knowledge gaps, we measured 12 ecosystem services (ES), including climat...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. As a {{powerful}} tool, biodiversity {{can be applied}} for assessing sustainability levels in <b>agroecosystems</b> as well as assessing {{both positive and negative}} effects of different agricultural activities and management strategies on the environment. It is the variety of life, including variation among genes, species and functional traits, which can increase the productivity of farming systems in a range of growing conditions, and also can maintain and increase soil fertility and mitigate the impact of pests and diseases. More diverse farming systems are generally more resilient in the face of perturbations, thus enhancing food security. For agriculture, biodiversity can be also expressed as planned (agricultural) and associated (para-agricultural and extra-agricultural) biodiversity, which reflect different functions of plants, animals and micro-organisms in <b>agroecosystems.</b> This paper introduces the categories of biodiversity in <b>agroecosystems,</b> assesses the functional biodiversity in sustainable <b>agroecosystems,</b> and prospects the significant of biodiversity in sustainable <b>agroecosystems...</b>|$|R
25|$|As coffee {{becomes one}} of the most {{important}} export crops in certain regions such as northern Latin America, nature and agriculture are transformed. Increased productivity requires technological innovations, and the coffee <b>agroecosystem</b> has been changing rapidly. In the nineteenth century in Latin America, coffee plantations slowly began replacing sugarcane and subsistence crops. Coffee crops became more managed; they were put into rows and unshaded, meaning diversity of the forest was decreased and Coffea trees were shorter. As plant and tree diversity decreased, so did animal diversity. Unshaded plantations allow for a higher density of Coffea trees, but negative effects include less protection from wind and more easily eroded soil. Technified coffee plantations also use chemicals such as fertilizers, insecticides, and fungicides.|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} a general model for analysing nutrient cycling in <b>agroecosystems.</b> The {{focus is on}} food production intensity, human carrying capacity, sustainability and efficiency. The model {{can be used on}} systems including different kinds of land uses, which makes it applicable for studies on different scales. Comparisons of all kinds of <b>agroecosystems,</b> independent of time and place, are made possible. Different kinds of nutrients can be studied with the model. Here, nitrogen cycling is used as an example. A region in Scania, southern Sweden, 1858, and two Tanzanian villages, 1989 - 91, are analysed. The book includes a discussion of ecological principles of how humans can increase their food production, based on nutrient cycling and with concrete examples. Main conclusions in the thesis are: - There exists a conflict between increase of food production and sustainability. - Crop-dominated <b>agroecosystems</b> have higher human carrying capacities and are more efficient, concerning nitrogen losses per unit of nitrogen in the food produced, than livestock-dominated <b>agroecosystems.</b> - Neither the Tanzanian nor the Scanian <b>agroecosystems</b> can be judged as being sustainable. - There were high losses of nitrogen from livestock manure/excreta, especially in the Scanian <b>agroecosystems.</b> - Biological nitrogen fixation on cultivated land was the most important input in the Scanian <b>agroecosystems</b> and has a large potential for improving the negative nitrogen budgets of cultivated land in the Tanzanian systems...|$|R

Traditionally an <b>agroecosystem,</b> particularly one managed intensively, is characterized as having a simpler species composition and simpler energy and nutrient flows than [...] "natural" [...] ecosystem.

40|$|Abstract Background Traditional <b>agroecosystems</b> {{are known}} to host both large crop species {{diversity}} and high within crop genetic diversity. In a context of global change, this diversity {{may be needed to}} feed the world. Are these <b>agroecosystems</b> museums (i. e. large core collections) or cradles of diversity? We investigated this question for a clonally propagated plant, fig (Ficus carica), within its native range, in Morocco, but as far away as possible from supposed centers of domestication. Results Fig varieties were locally numerous. They were found to be mainly highly local and corresponded to clones propagated vegetatively. Nevertheless these clones were often sufficiently old to have accumulated somatic mutations for selected traits (fig skin color) and at neutral loci (microsatellite markers). Further the pattern of spatial genetic structure was similar to the pattern expected in natural population for a mutation/drift/migration model at equilibrium, with homogeneous levels of local genetic diversity throughout Moroccan traditional <b>agroecosystems.</b> Conclusions We conclude that traditional <b>agroecosystems</b> constitue active incubators of varietal diversity even for clonally propagated crop species, and even when varieties correspond to clones that are often old. As only female fig is cultivated, wild fig and cultivated fig probably constitute a single evolutionary unit within these traditional <b>agroecosystems.</b> Core collections, however useful, are museums and hence cannot serve the same functions as traditional <b>agroecosystems.</b> </p...|$|R

50|$|It is {{difficult}} to discuss these differences {{without the aid of}} an example. Consider the case of a conventional (see conventional agriculture) apple farmer.

This farmer evaluated his situation and reconfigured it to try to improve it. Some might look at this situation and conclude that the apple farmer chose organic apple production because it is more sustainable for the environment. But, what if a few years later the farmer finds that he is struggling to make a profit and decides to go back to conventional agriculture? The farmer performed another <b>agroecosystem</b> analysis and arrived at a reconfiguration that some might see as unsustainable.
