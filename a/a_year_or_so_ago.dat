6000|$|Presently as I and Philip made unreal {{conversation}} together I saw Mary disengage {{herself and}} come towards us. It {{was as if}} a princess came towards a beggar. Absurd are the changes of phase between women and men. <b>A</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>ago</b> and all of us had been but [...] "the children" [...] together; now here were I and Philip mere youths still, nobodies, echoes and aspirations, crude promises at the best, and here was Mary in full flower, as glorious and central as the Hampton Court azaleas in spring.|$|E
60|$|Now, <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>ago,</b> I had {{occupied}} my leisure in taking a London science degree, so that I have {{a smattering of}} physics and mineralogy. The thing was not unlike an uncut diamond of the darker sort, though far too large, being {{almost as big as}} the top of my thumb. I took it, and saw it had the form of a regular octahedron, with the curved faces peculiar to the most precious of minerals. I took out my penknife and tried to scratch it--vainly. Leaning forward towards the gas-lamp, I tried the thing on my watch-glass, and scored a white line across that with the greatest ease.|$|E
6000|$|... "You, of course," [...] Mr. Jarvis went on, [...] "could {{scarcely}} {{have noticed}} it, {{as you have}} been here so short a time, but I {{can assure you that}} <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>ago</b> the governor was a different person altogether. He was out in the warehouse half the morning, watching the stuff being unloaded, sampling it, and suggesting customers. He took a live interest in the business, Chetwode. He was here, there and everywhere. To-day--for the last few weeks, indeed--he has scarcely left his office. He sits there, signs a few letters, listens to what I have to say, and goodness knows how he spends the rest of his time. Where the business would be," [...] Mr. Jarvis continued, rubbing his chin thoughtfully, [...] "if it were not for us who know the running of it so well, I can't say, but a fact it is that Mr. Weatherley seems to have lost all interest in it." ...|$|E

I have my own peculiar ideas, only, lately, I've begun to doubt them. <b>A</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>ago</b> I would have said girls had their own way too much--too much time to themselves--too much freedom. But now I seem to feel life isn't like what {{it was a few}} years ago. Girls are bound to learn. And they never learn at home, that's sure. The last thing a mother will do is to tell her daughter what she ought to know. There's always been a shadow between most mothers and daughters. And in these days of jazz it has become a wall. Perhaps that's why girls don't confide in their mothers.... Mrs. Bell, I considered it my duty to acquaint you with the truth about these verses and notes, and what they imply. Would you care to read some of them?" ...|$|E
60|$|Effie, too, I have parted from, though I {{still see}} her at times. Between us {{there was never}} any {{intention}} of marriage nor intimacy of soul. She had a sudden, fierce, hot-blooded passion for me and I for her, but I was not her first lover nor her last. She was in another world from Marion. She had a queer, delightful nature; I've no memory of ever seeing her sullen or malicious. She was--indeed she was magnificently--eupeptic. That, I think, was the central secret of her agreeableness, and, moreover, that she was infinitely kind-hearted. I helped her at last into an opening she coveted, and she amazed me by a sudden display of business capacity. She has now a typewriting bureau in Riffle's Inn, and she runs it with a brisk vigour and considerable success, albeit a certain plumpness has overtaken her. And she still loves her kind. She married <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>ago</b> a boy half her age--a wretch of a poet, a wretched poet, and given to drugs, a thing with lank fair hair always getting into his blue eyes, and limp legs. She did it, she said, because he needed nursing....|$|E
6000|$|The {{object of}} Mr. Cavor's search was a {{substance}} that should be [...] "opaque"--he used some other word I have forgotten, but [...] "opaque" [...] conveys the idea--to [...] "all forms of radiant energy." [...] "Radiant energy," [...] he made me understand, was anything like light or heat, or those Rontgen Rays {{there was so much}} talk about <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>ago,</b> or the electric waves of Marconi, or gravitation. All these things, he said, radiate out from centres, and act on bodies at a distance, whence comes the term [...] "radiant energy." [...] Now almost all substances are opaque to some form or other of radiant energy. Glass, for example, is transparent to light, but much less so to heat, so that it is useful as a fire-screen; and alum is transparent to light, but blocks heat completely. A solution of iodine in carbon bisulphide, on the other hand, completely blocks light, but is quite transparent to heat. It will hide a fire from you, but permit all its warmth to reach you. Metals are not only opaque to light and heat, but also to electrical energy, which passes through both iodine solution and glass almost as though they were not interposed. And so on.|$|E

60|$|At dinner to-day {{there was}} a young Frenchman, whom ------ befriended <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>ago,</b> when he had not another friend in America, and {{obtained}} employment for him in a large dry-goods establishment. He is a young man of eighteen or thereabouts, with smooth black hair, neatly dressed; his face showing a good disposition, but with nothing of intellect or character. It is funny to think of this poor little Frenchman, a Parisian too, eating our most un-French victuals,--our beefsteaks, and roasts, and various homely puddings and hams, and all things most incongruent to his hereditary stomach; but nevertheless he eats most cheerfully and uncomplainingly. He has not a large measure of French vivacity, never rattles, never dances, nor breaks into ebullitions of mirth and song; on the contrary, I have never known a youth of his age more orderly and decorous. He is kind-hearted and grateful, and evinces his gratitude to the mother of the family and to his benefactress by occasional presents, not trifling when measured by his small emolument of five dollars per week. Just at this time he is confined to his room by indisposition, caused, it is suspected, by a spree on Sunday last. Our gross Saxon orgies would soon be the ruin of his French constitution.|$|E
6000|$|To your eye, now, {{he would}} seem the strangest figure, in the utter {{disregard}} of all physical beauty or dignity about him. You would find him extraordinarily odd, {{but in the}} old days he met not only with acceptance but respect. He was alive until within <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>ago,</b> but his later appearance changed. As I saw him that afternoon he was a very slovenly, ungainly little human being indeed, not only was his clothing altogether ugly and queer, but had you stripped the man stark, you would certainly have seen in the bulging paunch that comes from flabby muscles and flabbily controlled appetites, and in the rounded shoulders and flawed and yellowish skin, the same failure of any effort toward clean beauty. You had an instinctive sense that so he had been from the beginning. You felt he was not only drifting through life, eating what came in his way, believing what came in his way, doing without any vigor what came in his way, but that into life also he had drifted. You could not believe him the child of pride and high resolve, or of any splendid passion of love. He had just HAPPENED. [...] . But we all happened then. Why am I taking this tone over this poor little curate in particular? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{perhaps is}} the only way in which wars of this kind will ever be brought to an end. By women insisting on killing {{the kind of people who}} make them. Rooting them out. By a {{campaign}} of pursuit and assassination that will go on for years and years after the war itself is over.... Murder is such a little gentle punishment for the crime of war.... It would be hardly more than a reproach for what has happened. Falling like snow. Death after death. Flake by flake. This prince. That statesman. The count who writes so fiercely for war.... That is what I am going to do. If Teddy is really dead.... We women were ready enough <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>ago</b> to starve and die for the Vote, and that was quite a little thing in comparison with this business.... Don't you see what I mean? It's so plain and sensible, Cissie. Whenever a man sits and thinks whether he will make a war or not, then he will think too of women, women with daggers, bombs; of a vengeance that will never tire nor rest; of consecrated patient women ready to start out upon a pilgrimage that will only end with his death.... I wouldn't hurt these war makers. No. In spite of the poison gas. In spite of trench feet and the men who have been made blind and the wounded who have lain for days, dying slowly in the wet. Women ought not to hurt. But I would kill. Like killing dangerous vermin. It would go on year by year. Balkan kings, German princes, chancellors, they would have schemed for so much--and come to just a rattle in the throat.... And if presently other kings and emperors began to prance about and review armies, they too would go....|$|E
