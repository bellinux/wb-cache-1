5|$|A {{state of}} {{emergency}} was declared {{for the state of}} Oaxaca shortly after Pauline made landfall. Abundant rainfall caused the River Los Perros to overflow its capacity, flooding 50municipalities in Oaxaca.

The passage of the hurricane affected thousands of houses, leaving roughly 250,000homeless in the state.

5|$|Canada has a {{well-developed}} media sector, but {{its cultural}} output; particularly in English films, television shows, and magazines, is often overshadowed by imports from the United States. As a result, {{the preservation of}} a distinctly Canadian culture is supported by federal government programs, laws, and {{institutions such as the}} Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), and the Canadian Radio-television <b>and</b> <b>Telecommunications</b> Commission (CRTC).|$|E
5|$|In a 2005 Canadian dispute, Rogers Media and Newcap Broadcasting {{maintained}} a joint sales agreement pertaining to CHNO-FM in Sudbury, Ontario, but community {{interests and the}} lobby group Friends of Canadian Broadcasting presented substantial evidence to the Canadian Radio-television <b>and</b> <b>Telecommunications</b> Commission that in practice, the agreement was a de facto LMA, going significantly beyond advertising sales into program production and news-gathering. LMAs in Canada cannot be implemented without the CRTC's approval, and in early 2005, the CRTC ordered the agreement to cease.|$|E

5|$|During the 1970s, several U.S. Navy {{submarines}} {{were forced}} back to base to repair {{damage caused by}} cookiecutter shark bites to the neoprene boots of their AN/BQR-19 sonar domes, which caused the sound-transmitting oil inside to leak and impaired navigation. An unknown enemy weapon was initially feared, before this shark was identified as the culprit, and the problem was solved by installing fiberglass covers around the domes. In the 1980s, some thirty U.S. Navy submarines were damaged by cookiecutter shark bites, mostly to the rubber-sheathed electric cable leading to the sounding probe used to ensure safety when surfacing in shipping zones. Again, the solution was to apply a fiberglass coating. Oceanographic equipment <b>and</b> <b>telecommunications</b> cables have also been damaged by this species.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Fluor's {{revenues}} fell almost 50 percent, in {{part due}} to the Asian financial crisis and a decrease in overseas business. Additionally, it suffered losses from an over-budget power plant project in Rabigh, Saudi Arabia. Fluor was a sub-contractor to General Electric for the project. Fluor's subsidiaries sued GE alleging that it misrepresented the complexity of the project. Though revenues declined further the following year, profits were increasing. In 1999, nearly 5,000 workers were laid off from Fluor Daniel and 15 offices were closed. Fluor Daniel was re-structured into four business groups: an engineering and construction firm called Fluor Daniel; an equipment rental, staffing <b>and</b> <b>telecommunications</b> division called Fluor Global Services; a coal-mining business called A.T.
