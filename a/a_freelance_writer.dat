5|$|Born in Swansea, Davies {{aspired to}} work as a comic artist in his adult life, until a careers advisor at Olchfa School {{suggested}} that he study English literature; he consequently focused on a career of play-andscreen-writing. After he graduated from Oxford University, Davies joined the BBC's children's department in 1985 on a part-time basis and worked in varying positions, including writing and producing two series, Dark Season and Century Falls. He left the BBC in the early 1990s to work for Granada Television and later became <b>a</b> <b>freelance</b> <b>writer.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1992, Sheridan {{was hired}} as an {{assistant}} writer for the sitcom Shaky Ground. During his time on the show, he also worked elsewhere as <b>a</b> <b>freelance</b> <b>writer.</b> Following that show's cancellation in 1993, Sheridan {{was hired as}} an assistant on the show Living Single, where he wrote four episodes. Sheridan was promoted to writer, and worked on the show until it was cancelled in 1998.

5|$|In mid-1945, {{after the}} end of World War II in Europe, he was in Germany with the U. S. Strategic Bombing Survey, {{studying}} the effects of Allied bombing on German morale, an experience that affected his postwar work as his visit to Spain had affected him earlier. On his return, he settled in Manhattan, working as <b>a</b> <b>freelance</b> <b>writer,</b> a lecturer at The New School for Social Research, and a visiting professor at Bennington, Smith, and other American colleges. In 1946 he became a naturalised citizen of the US.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor that}} brought Cardus to England in 1948 was the {{prospect}} of succeeding Newman, whose retirement as chief music critic of The Sunday Times {{was assumed to be}} imminent. However, Newman had no intention of retiring, and {{made it clear that he}} would resent any successor-designate looking over his shoulder. Feeling slighted, Cardus resigned from the paper and accepted an offer from the London Evening Standard to be its music critic. This new appointment was short-lived; Cardus's lengthy and discursive concert reviews were incompatible with this paper's style, and were ruthlessly cut by subeditors. At the end of 1948 he was back in Australia, proclaiming his intention to settle there permanently. This determination, too, was brief; the lure of London life proved irresistible. Because of the commercial success of his Autobiography, published in 1947, and the immediate commissioning of a second autobiographical work, Cardus was not under immediate financial pressure. He left Australia again in the spring of 1949, and although he spent the English winter of 1950–51 in Australia, writing about the 1950–51 England v. Australia Test series for the Sydney Morning Herald, London was thereafter his permanent home. Here he worked as <b>a</b> <b>freelance</b> <b>writer,</b> in which role he resumed his association with The Manchester Guardian. In December 1951 he was appointed the paper's London music critic, on a permanent salaried basis.|$|E
