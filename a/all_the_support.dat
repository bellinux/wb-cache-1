5|$|He {{arranged}} {{a new system}} to appoint judges. Instead of simply proposing a new judge candidate to the Congress, the presidency first released names {{of a number of}} potential candidates, who were then evaluated by several non-governmental organizations, who assessed if the candidate was suitable as a judge. The ministry of justice compiled <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> and criticism, and the president then decided which candidate would be proposed to the Congress, which made the final decision, as under the previous system. Raúl Zaffaroni, a former FREPASO politician, was the first judicial appointment under the new system. He was followed by Elena Highton de Nolasco, the first woman appointed to the Supreme Court. The appointment of Carmen Argibay (another female judge) was controversial, since Argibay was an atheist and a supporter of legal abortion. The judges held liberal views on criminal justice, countering social demands for harsher, pro-victim policies after the murder of Axel Blumberg. However, the new Supreme Court had little political power, as the national government ignored all rulings that were not favorable.|$|E

Her father, Alfonso Valiente, is of Filipino descent, while her mother, Rosemary Elikolani, has Native Hawaiian and Ukrainian ancestry. Scherzinger's parents {{separated}} {{when she was still}} a baby. When she was six years old, her maternal family moved to Louisville, Kentucky, with her sister, Keala, and her German American stepfather, Gary Scherzinger. She took her stepfather's surname after he adopted her. She first attended Bowen Elementary, and later attended Meyzeek Middle School as an adolescent. Scherzinger states that, growing up, her family did not have a lot of money, and she gave thanks to her mother for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> she gave her to become what she is today. Scherzinger began performing in Louisville, attending the Youth Performing Arts School at duPont Manual High School, and performing with Actors Theatre of Louisville. As a teenager, Scherzinger was the first runner-up at the 1996 Kentucky State Fair's Coca-Cola Talent Classic contest. In 2007, she was inducted to duPont Manual Alumni's Hall of Fame as one of the youngest inductees. After earning a scholarship, she furthered her studies at Wright State University majoring in theater arts with a dance minor.

500|$|By {{the autumn}} of 1919, the {{budgetary}} effects of Lloyd George's Ten Year Rule were causing Trenchard some difficulty as he sought to develop {{the institutions of the}} RAF. [...] He had to argue against the view that the Army and Navy should provide <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> services and education, leaving the RAF only to provide flying training. [...] Trenchard viewed this idea as a precursor to the break-up of the RAF and in spite of the costs, he wanted his own institutions which would develop airmanship and engender the air spirit. [...] Having convinced Churchill of his case, Trenchard oversaw the founding of the RAF (Cadet) College at Cranwell as the world's first military air academy. Later, in 1920, Trenchard inaugurated the Aircraft Apprentice scheme which provided the RAF with specialist groundcrew for over 70 years. [...] In 1922, the RAF Staff College at Andover was set up to provide air force-specific training to the RAF's middle-ranking officers.|$|E

The singalong featured Michael's siblings (including Rebbie) and the late singer's children. Following the service which was held at Los Angeles' Staples Center Rebbie, along with sisters Janet and La Toya, addressed fans at the nearby L.A. Live entertainment complex: [...] "We are extremely grateful for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>support.</b> We love you all." [...] In the weeks following Michael's death, it was speculated by media sources that Rebbie would be the primary caregiver for her late brother's children, Prince, Paris, and Blanket. It was stated that even if Michael and Rebbie's mother Katherine were granted custody of the children, Rebbie would care for the siblings {{on a day-to-day basis}} at the Jackson family's Encino home. Katherine was named the legal guardian of them in August 2009 after the death of Michael Jackson. In early 2011, Rebbie announced she'd begun recording for a new album, her first in 14 years.

500|$|Stevenage's league {{campaign}} {{got off to}} {{a typically}} patchy start; with the side recording just one win from their first five games of the season. Following a 2–1 defeat to Oxford United in August 2009, the team went on a 17-game unbeaten run that stretched four months from August to December 2009, propelling the club into the top two. Unlike in previous seasons, the club were performing strongly away from home, and secured victories at the likes of Luton Town and Mansfield Town. A 4–1 victory against Cambridge United on New Year's Day ultimately meant that Stevenage hit top-spot {{for the first time in}} the season. However, two defeats on the road within the space of a week in February meant that rivals Oxford United had an eight–point lead going into March 2010. The team responded well, winning eight games on the bounce; including an important 1–0 victory over Oxford United in late March, subsequently replacing Oxford at the top of the table. Borough brushed aside a late challenge from Luton Town, securing promotion to the Football League with two games to spare following a 2–0 win against Kidderminster Harriers at Aggborough. The team won their last six games of the league campaign without conceding a single goal, and recorded 42 points from a possible 45 from their last 15 league fixtures. Stevenage finished the season having amassed a total of 99 points from 44 games, winning the league by 11 points, with Westley winning many plaudits for the way he had secured promotion despite considerably less resources than a lot of the teams in the division. The promotion means Westley has led Stevenage to the Football League for the first time in their history, as well as managing a Football League team for the first time in his managerial career. Westley also guided the club to another FA Trophy Final; this time losing 2–1 after extra-time against Barrow at Wembley Stadium. At the end of the season, Westley signed a new two-year contract; keeping him contracted to the club until 2012. On signing the new deal, Westley said [...] "I am grateful for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> that we have all been given in the past two years. I am delighted to have the opportunity to manage the launch of the club into the Football League". In his first two seasons back at the club, from May 2008 to May 2010, Westley has been in charge for 114 games, winning a total of 70 games – recording a win percentage of 61.40%.|$|E
500|$|Contador {{took the}} most time against the main field out of any day in stage 13. On this day, which ended at the Grossglockner in Austria, he and Rujano again {{finished}} well ahead of the main field. As they approached the finish line, Contador {{did not attempt to}} sprint for the win, allowing Rujano to take it. Their minute and a half time gap, plus the time bonus for second place, gave Contador a lead of over three minutes in the overall standings. Only in the 2009 Tour de France had he ever held a larger lead. The next two days were extremely difficult high mountain stages, both won by members of the [...] team. Contador finished the best of any rider in the top five overall on both days, and so further padded his advantage. Wearing a black armband to memorialize fellow Spanish cyclist Xavier Tondó who, though not a participant in the race, died while it was run, Contador dominantly won the stage 16 uphill individual time trial. This result put him nearly five minutes clear of the next-best rider, the largest such advantage he had ever held in any race. In stage 19, Contador again finished with another rider ahead of the main field. This time it was 's Paolo Tiralongo, a former teammate of Contador's. Just as he had with Rujano earlier, Contador appeared to allow his companion a stage win he could have easily taken himself. Contador later commented that the victory, the first of Tiralongo's 12-year career, was meant as a gesture of thanks to the Italian for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> riding he did for him in 2010 when the two were on the same squad. Although Contador claimed {{that he was not going}} to give his strongest effort in the stage 21 individual time trial, the Giro's final stage, his ride was still good enough for third place, extending his winning margin to over six minutes, giving him his sixth and statistically most dominant Grand Tour championship. Contador's two stage wins and numerous top five placings also made him the winner of the points competition, by a substantial margin. Michele Scarponi and Vincenzo Nibali completed the podium, in that order, having targeted one another once it became obvious that Contador's advantage was insurmountable. Nibali held second place on stages 13 and 14, but Scarponi overtook him on Gardeccia, finishing a minute and a half better (only six seconds the lesser of Contador), and never relinquished second place. Stefano Garzelli was in the breakaway on the Gardeccia stage and took maximum points on three of the day's five climbs, and second place points on the other two. It was largely thanks to this performance that he won the mountains classification at the end of the race. Roman Kreuziger, still eligible by a matter of months, won the youth competition with his ride to sixth place overall.|$|E
