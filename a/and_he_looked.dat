5|$|Christopher {{gained the}} weight back and rejoined the Athletics for the 1947 season. While {{there was talk}} of keeping him in the rotation, he ended up {{becoming}} a full-time reliever for the team. Despite this, Christopher was still able to contribute with his bat; he drove in the winning run in a May 29 game against the Red Sox. Over the course of the season, Christopher evolved into the Athletics' closer, finishing the games when the team's pitchers could not go the distance. He finished the season having played 44 games, finishing 38 of them and getting 12 saves in the process. He also had 10 wins, seven losses, and a 2.90 ERA. At the end of the season, Christopher was holding out on his contract, wanting either a starting role in the rotation or more money to remain a reliever. The two sides agreed to a deal at the end of February, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> to be a starting pitcher during the 1948 season.|$|E
5|$|Wiggins {{was born}} in Los Angeles, California. His mother, Karla Wiggins, raised him as a single parent. He played {{baseball}} with his friends at a park across from the Rose Bowl. As a child, Wiggins was {{a fan of the}} Los Angeles Dodgers, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> up to Maury Wills, a Dodgers player known for stealing bases. Wiggins graduated from John Muir High School in Pasadena, California; the school was also the alma mater of baseball star Jackie Robinson. Gib Bodet, a scout for the Montreal Expos, noticed Wiggins in high school. Wiggins was , taller than a typical infielder. He was only an average hitter and fielder, but his speed stood out to Bodet.|$|E

Davis won the next two frames on the final black to lead 13–11, before Taylor drew level at 15–15. Errors were creeping in Davis's game <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> the more nervous of the two players but he managed to win the next two frames to lead 17–15 again, before Taylor won a hotly contested 33rd frame followed by a fifty plus break in frame 34 to draw level at 17–17 and forced the deciding frame.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the 1967 English cricket season, it {{was agreed}} that each county club could {{immediately}} sign a non-English player for the 1968 season. Seven clubs approached Sobers and, on 14 December 1967, Nottinghamshire announced that he had signed for them and had been appointed club captain. Sobers stated that, although he had enjoyed his time in league cricket, he had a definite preference for the first-class game <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> forward to restoring Nottinghamshire's fortunes. Though details were undisclosed, Wisden 1968 speculated that his contract would run for three years and be worth £7000 a year (a very high income at the time), including an apartment and a car.|$|E
25|$|Mato Medović {{was born}} on 17 November 1857 in Kuna on the Pelješac {{peninsula}} into a peasant family. Young Mato got his first education at a nearby Franciscan monastery dedicated to Our Lady of Loreto (Delorita). In 1868, {{at the age of}} 11 he joined the Franciscan seminary in Dubrovnik, where he took his vows in 1874, taking the name of Celestin. The artistic talent of the young monk was noticed by Abbot Portoguaro Bernardino, on a visit from Rome. So in 1880, Medović was placed in the monastery of St Isidoro in Rome, known for its Nazarene painters. He was assigned to Lodovico Seitz, an influential artist who painted the frescoes in the Cathedral of Đakovo. However, the rigid and outdated artistic style did not suit Medović, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> for a different teacher in Giuseppe Grandi, then in the private school of Antonio Ciseri in Florence.|$|E
25|$|Case 2. This case {{illustrates}} autonomic status epilepticus {{with behavioral}} disturbances {{that would be}} difficult to attribute to seizure activity before the motor focal ictal events. A 6-year-old normal boy had a seizure at 4 years of age while traveling on a train with his parents who vividly described the event: “He was happily playing and asking questions when he started complaining that he was feeling sick, became very pale, and quiet. He did not want to drink or eat. Gradually, he was getting more and more pale, kept complaining that he felt sick, and became restless and frightened. Ten minutes from the onset, his head and eyes slowly turned to the left. The eyes were opened but fixed to the left upper corner. We called his name but he was unresponsive. He had completely gone. We tried to move his head but this was fixed to the left. There were no convulsions. This lasted for another 15 minutes, when his head and eyes returned to normal <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> better, although he was droopy and really not there. At this stage he vomited once. In the ambulance, approximately 35 minutes from the onset, he was still not aware of what was going on, although he was able to answer simple questions with yes or no. In the hospital he slept for three quarters of an hour and gradually came around, but it took him another half to an hour before he became normal again”. EEG showed occipital paroxysms and MRI was normal. A similar prolonged episode, preceded by behavioral changes, occurred 8 months later at school. He received no medication. Since then he has been well.|$|E

He said [...] "we are indebted to so many tonight", thanking the [...] "wonderful volunteers, the much needed heroes of these Games", {{as well as the}} British public and the athletes. Rogge said that the athletes had earned the right to be called 'Olympians' due to the fair play and graciousness that they had shown, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> forward to the Paralympic Games. Rogge {{concluded}} by calling the Games [...] "happy and glorious", before proceeding to close the competition and calling upon the youth of the world to assemble in Rio in 2016, ending with [...] "Thank you, London!".|$|E
500|$|The score {{remained}} 1–0 at half-time, {{and it was}} {{the same}} story in the second half: England missed a multitude of easy chances, hit the woodwork numerous times and had one effort that appeared to cross the line not given. The England captain Billy Wright recalled that [...] "even Alf Ramsey, who used to be expressionless throughout a game, threw up his arms and looked to the sky when a perfect free-kick was somehow saved by their unorthodox keeper". No England goal came—the United States won 1–0 in what entered English football history as the national team's most embarrassing upset. Ramsey, who was fiercely patriotic, took the result as an acute personal humiliation. One journalist recalled that on hearing the match mentioned years later, [...] "his face creased <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> like {{a man who had been}} jabbed in an unhealed wound". England could remain in the competition if they beat Spain in their last group game, but a 1–0 defeat saw them crash out.|$|E

[...] Oana spent most of the 1934 season with the Crackers, compiling a [...]289 batting average and 17 home runs in 480 at bats. [...] Despite playing less than the full season in the Southern Association, he led the circuit in home runs and finished second in the league with 100 RBIs. [...] Finding no interest from major league clubs after his 1934 season in Atlanta, Oana reportedly expressed interest in pursuing a career as a professional wrestler, with one account indicating that he hoped to [...] "cash in" [...] on his [...] "wrestling experience on the island with Japanese grapplers." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the second}} day, Barnes and Bradman took the score to 1/121 before Barnes and Miller were {{dismissed}} without further {{addition to the}} score. All the while, Australia had been scoring slowly, as they would throughout the day. Brown came in at No. 5 to join Bradman, but he had played {{most of his career}} as an opening batsman <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> uncomfortable in the middle order, but Bradman brought him in ahead of Hassett as the new ball was due and Brown was used to starting his innings against pace bowlers and a new ball. English captain Norman Yardley removed Jim Laker from the attack and took the second new ball. Bradman struck his first boundary in over 80 minutes and the run rate picked up somewhat, prompting England to revert to slower bowling. Australia passed England's total before Yardley brought himself on to bowl and trapped Brownwho was attempting to push the ball to mid-onleg before wicket (lbw) with an off cutter in his first over. This ended a 64-run stand in 58 minutes and left Australia at 4/185. Following the departure of Brown, the scoring slowed as Bradman changed the team strategy to one of attempting to bat only once. Australia eventually reached 509, and after England compiled 441 in their second innings, Brown was not needed as Australia made the [...] 98 runs required victory for the loss of only two wickets.|$|E

[...] At the March Wisconsin Pro Day workout, Bucky Brooks of NFL.com reported that Carimi: showed good footwork and lateral quickness in drills, {{and his body}} control is surprising given his frame.

2500|$|The {{film was}} ambitious as Lucas {{wanted to create}} fresh prop prototypes and sets (based on McQuarrie's paintings) {{that had never been}} {{realized}} before in science fiction films. He commissioned production designers John Barry and Roger Christian, who were working on the sets of the film Lucky Lady (1975) when Lucas first approached them, to work on the production sets. Christian recounted in 2014: [...] "George came to the set I was doing, it was an old salt factory design and he helped me shovel salt, just like two students in plaid shirts and sneakers. And we spoke <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> at the set and couldn't believe it wasn't real." [...] They had a conversation with Lucas on what he would like the film to appear like, with them creating the desired sets.
