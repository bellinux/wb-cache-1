5000|$|The OMC is more {{intergovernmental}} {{in nature}} {{than the traditional}} means of policy-making in the EU, the so-called community method. Because it is a decentralised approach through which <b>agreed</b> <b>policies</b> are largely implemented by the member states and supervised by the Council of the European Union, {{the involvement of the}} European Parliament and the European Court of Justice is very weak indeed. Formally, at least, the European Commission has primarily a monitoring role; in practice, however, there is considerable scope for it to help set the policy agenda and persuade reluctant Member States to implement <b>agreed</b> <b>policies.</b> Although the OMC was devised as a tool in policy areas which remain the responsibility of national governments (and where the EU itself has no, or few, legislative powers) it is sometimes seen as a way for the Commission to [...] "get a foot in the door" [...] of a national policy area.|$|E

5000|$|Because {{no single}} policy can govern all systems or {{information}} needs, methods of reconciling differences between systems and then enforcing and monitoring <b>agreed</b> <b>policies</b> are {{necessary in order}} to share useful information and keep systems interconnected. Current static methods based on all-or-nothing access control are insufficient to meet variable information production and consumption needs, particularly when there are potentially competing policies (for example, the conflict between disclosure and privacy laws) that are contextually dependent. Access control mechanisms that simply control who has access between systems result in stove-piped information silos, [...] "walled gardens", and increased network fragmentation. Policy appliance is a general term to describe dynamic, contextually-aware control mechanisms currently being researched and developed to enforce use policies between systems.|$|E
40|$|People {{who have}} had a {{splenectomy}} for any reason are 40 {{times more likely to have}} an overwhelming infection, especially pneumococcal infection, and 17 times more likely to suffer fatal sepsis. The incidence of such life threatening infections is reduced by prophylactic immunisation with polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine and long term antibiotic prophylaxis or instituting prompt antibiotic treatment in the event of fever. This haematology unit <b>agreed</b> a <b>policy</b> of immunisation and antibiotic prophylaxis in June 1988 for all patients undergoing elective splenectomy. The success of this policy was audited in July 1993 by a retrospective analysis of patients' case notes. Seventy four patients were identified as having had a splenectomy, 54 (73 %) before June 1988, of whom only 13 (24 %) had received both pneumococcal immunisation and antibiotic prophylaxis before implementation of the <b>agreed</b> <b>policy.</b> At the time of audit, 46 / 74 (62 %) patients were recorded as having received immunisation and 64 / 74 (86 %) as receiving antibiotic prophylaxis or a supply of antibiotics to take in the event of a fever. All but one of the 20 patients who had a splenectomy after June 1988, since implementation of the <b>agreed</b> <b>policy,</b> received immunisation and antibiotic prophylaxis. The authors conclude that establishment of a formal <b>agreed</b> <b>policy</b> for pneumococcal prophylaxis for patients undergoing splenectomy has improved the quality of care...|$|R

When the Congress was not in session, the Central Committee was the highest body.

The party leader was the head of government and held the office of either General Secretary, Premier or head of state, or some of the three offices concurrentlybut never all three at the same time. The party leader was the de facto chairman of the CPSU Politburo {{and chief executive of the}} USSR; the tension between the party and the state (Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union) for the shifting locus of power was never formally resolved, but in reality the party dominated, and a paramount leader always existed (first Lenin and thereafter the General Secretary).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical framework for considering {{the role of}} IMF-supported programs in preventing crises, particularly capital account crises. The model builds upon the global games framework to establish a unique relationship between the crisis probability and {{the parameters of the}} program, which is assumed to be negotiated between the IMF and the member country, taking explicit account of each party''s interests. In the model, {{from the perspective of the}} borrowing country, IMF financing and policy adjustment are (perfect) substitutes inasmuch as they both contribute to the country''s liquidity and thus reduce the likelihood of a crisis. In equilibrium, however, IMF financing promotes stronger policies, implying that financing and adjustment are strong complements in crisis prevention. Conditionality plays a crucial role in sustaining the program, providing mutual assurances-to the member country that, if it undertakes the <b>agreed</b> <b>policies,</b> financing will indeed be forthcoming, and to the IMF that the country will implement the <b>agreed</b> <b>policies</b> as the IMF disburses its resources. The model helps explain how liquidity crises may come about, how IMF support can reduce the likelihood of a crisis by providing liquidity and sustaining stronger policies, and why the observed mix between financing and adjustment may vary across programs.

The paper identifies a number of reasons to be skeptical about how much the <b>agreed</b> <b>policies</b> will improve Germany's energy security, but it concludes that there are nevertheless good reasons to expect the issue to regain the attention of policy-makers in the future.

However translating promises into action will require a concerted consultative process on planning and reform, development and agreement on performance indicators, and the ability to move simultaneously on a number of fronts while confronting vested interests opposed to change. As the Government moves to tackle its election commitments in health, it must juggle the information flow from a range of new working groups, advisory committees and commissions, assess and develop policies, and then implement <b>agreed</b> <b>policies</b> and performance indicators into funding agreements. This paper examines the issues that are likely to arise in this process.

The principal areas of concern are two-fold: multiresistant opportunist bacteria that affect vulnerable patients in high dependency areas of hospitals (the most pressing problem for developed countries); and multidrug resistance among classic pathogens like Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella typhi, Shigella spp., Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Plasmodium fakiparum (mainly, although not exclusively, a problem for developing countries). The first type can be contained {{to a large extent}} by good infection control practices and careful prescribing based on <b>agreed</b> <b>policies</b> of {{antimicrobial drug}} use.
