5|$|In 1999, then-President Hugo Sonnenschein {{announced}} plans to relax the university's famed core curriculum, {{reducing the number of}} required courses from 21 to 15.

However, Kelly had not played in any games at that point. He was removed from the roster and thus avoided suspension by MLB.|$|E

Temperature rises on the Tibetan Plateau are causing Himalayan glaciers to retreat, threatening the flow rate of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Yamuna, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>major</b> rivers; the livelihoods {{of hundreds of thousands of}} farmers depend on these rivers.

5|$|In 1984 the {{non-stop}} Gatwick Express {{service was}} started, {{aiming for a}} 30-minute journey time.

British Airways <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>major</b> airlines had their own check-in desks there. British Rail operated an International Travel Centre within the main station, separate from the domestic travel centre. At the time, Victoria was still a major departure point for international travel, with boat trains to Dover and Folkestone for France and Belgium and beyond. This ceased {{with the introduction of}} Eurostar in 1994, which did not serve Victoria, and the International Travel Centre closed.|$|E

One hundered and nine (109) business majors (management and business adminstration) <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>majors</b> (Philology <b>and</b> Advertising) students were surveyed. Sternberg et al.

Taking into account the findings about telephone records of various activists, Kodnani <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>major</b> leaders were included in the report for the first time. The Special Investigation Team's findings added 24 more names to the 46 people arrested by the police. Before the trial began, 6 of the accused died.

A portion of sales tax revenues is set aside for this, some going into the Grand Forks Growth Fund.

The city also contributes to the Grand Forks Region Economic Development Corporation (EDC), a public-private organization that receives funding from banks <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>major</b> businesses. The EDC plays a consulting role for businesses, such as identifying suitable sites for expansion or assembling public funding packages. Its other key role is to vet businesses to see if they are suitable for funding by the Growth Fund.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the {{earliest}} primates, from which both the strepsirrhines and haplorhines (simians and tarsiers) evolved, is a mystery. Both their place of origin and the group from which they evolved are uncertain. Although the fossil record demonstrating their initial radiation across the Northern Hemisphere is very detailed, the fossil record from the tropics—where primates most likely evolved—is very poor, particularly around the time that primates <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>major</b> clades (groups consisting of an ancestor and all its descendants) of eutherian mammals were first appearing. Consequently, geneticists and primatologists have used genetic analyses to determine the relatedness between primate lineages {{and the amount of}} time since they diverged. Using this molecular clock, divergence dates for the major primate lineages have suggested that primates evolved more than 80–90mya, nearly 40million years before the first examples of which appear in the fossil record.|$|E
