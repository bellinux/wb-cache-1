5|$|The woodswallows are soft-plumaged, somber-coloured {{passerine}} birds. They are smooth, <b>agile</b> flyers with moderately large, semi-triangular wings.|$|E
5|$|A very <b>agile</b> mutant and henchman of Magneto. His powers {{include a}} prehensile tongue, a slimy {{substance}} that he spits onto others, and enhanced agility.|$|E
5|$|Jersey is {{the only}} place in the British Isles where the <b>agile</b> frog Rana dalmatina is found. The {{remaining}} population of <b>agile</b> frogs on Jersey is very small and is restricted to the south west of the island. The species is the subject of an ongoing programme to save it from extinction in Jersey via a collaboration between States of Jersey, Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and Jersey Amphibian and Reptile Group (JARG), with support and sponsorship from several other organisations. The programme includes captive breeding and release, public awareness and habitat restoration activities.|$|E
5|$|Not {{withstanding}} {{its initial}} reliability problems, the Tiger II was remarkably <b>agile</b> {{for such a}} heavy vehicle. Contemporary German records and testing results indicate that its tactical mobility {{was as good as}} or better than most German or Allied tanks.|$|E
5|$|The command's core {{missions}} include battlefield air operations; <b>agile</b> combat support; aviation foreign internal defense; information operations; precision aerospace fires; psychological operations; specialized air mobility; specialized refueling; and intelligence, {{surveillance and}} reconnaissance.|$|E
5|$|The school educates {{the future}} {{leaders of the}} US Armed Forces, its allies, and the Interagency at the {{graduate}} level to be <b>agile</b> and adaptive leaders who think critically at the strategic and operational levels to solve complex ambiguous problems.|$|E
5|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} flies with deep, slow wingbeats, {{giving it}} a wavelike movement. It can also glide for extended periods with its wings held downwards. Flocks generally fly at height, descending to treetops to feed or roost. Birds can be <b>agile,</b> manoeuvring quickly if startled or disturbed. In contrast, they waddle awkwardly on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} {{is caught in}} flight by several fast, <b>agile</b> falcon species, such as hobbies, and it {{sometimes}} carries parasites, but it faces no major threats. Because of its range of nearly 6millionkm2 (2.3millionsqmi) and a large and apparently increasing population, it is not seen as vulnerable and is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|While {{individual}} dogs may vary, {{in general}} show-bred Labradors are heavier built, slightly shorter-bodied, {{and have a}} thicker coat and tail. Field Labradors are generally longer-legged, lighter, and more lithe in build, making them <b>agile.</b> In the head, show Labradors tend to have broader heads, better defined stops, and more powerful necks, while field Labradors have lighter and slightly narrower heads with longer muzzles.|$|E
5|$|Adult dragonflies hunt on {{the wing}} using their {{exceptionally}} acute eyesight and strong, <b>agile</b> flight. They are almost exclusively carnivorous, eating {{a wide variety of}} insects ranging from small midges and mosquitoes to butterflies, moths, damselflies, and smaller dragonflies. A large prey item is subdued by being bitten on the head and is carried by the legs to a perch. Here, the wings are discarded and the prey usually ingested head first. A dragonfly may consume as much as a fifth of its body weight in prey per day.|$|E
5|$|Although Harvey {{started as}} a wicketkeeper at school, he became a highly {{regarded}} cover fielder and later in his international career became an <b>agile</b> slips catcher. He bowled off spin from a three to four pace approach on rare occasions, taking only three wickets in his Test career. Away from the field, Harvey had a quiet and unassuming manner, in complete contrast to his dynamic batting, and his non-smoking, non-drinking set him apart from the prevailing cricket culture of his period. Harvey {{was known for his}} respect for umpiring decisions and for never appealing for leg before wicket when he fielded in the slips.|$|E
5|$|Analyses of extinct adapiforms postcranial skeletons {{suggest a}} variety of {{locomotor}} behavior. The European adapids Adapis, Palaeolemur, and Leptadapis shared adaptations for slow climbing like the lorises, although {{they may have been}} quadrupedal runners like small New World monkeys. Both Notharctus and Smilodectes from North America and Europolemur from Europe exhibit limb proportions and joint surfaces comparable to vertical clinging and leaping lemurs, but were not as specialized as indriids for vertical clinging, suggesting that they ran along branches and did not leap as much. Notharctids Cantius and Pronycticebus appear to have been <b>agile</b> arboreal quadrupeds, with adaptations comparable to the brown lemurs.|$|E
5|$|As long {{as winter}} food is available, both {{the male and}} female will remain in the {{territory}} throughout the year, although occupying different areas. Migrants are more gregarious, travelling in small flocks and feeding in loose groups in the wintering grounds. The flight of migrating birds comprises bursts of rapid wing beats interspersed with level or diving movement, and differs from both the normal fast <b>agile</b> flight of this species and the more dipping action of larger thrushes.|$|E
5|$|Because {{it is both}} one of {{the first}} dinosaurs {{described}} and one of the best-known dinosaurs, Iguanodon has been well-placed as a barometer of changing public and scientific perceptions on dinosaurs. Its reconstructions have gone through three stages: the elephantine quadrupedal horn-snouted reptile satisfied the Victorians, then a bipedal but still fundamentally reptilian animal using its tail to prop itself up dominated the early 20th century, but was slowly overturned during the 1960s by its current, more <b>agile</b> and dynamic representation, able to shift from two legs to all fours.|$|E
5|$|Black currawongs {{are very}} common around picnic areas in Tasmania's {{two most popular}} National Parks, Freycinet and Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair, and are often fed by {{tourists}} there. The National Parks Authority tolerated this practice until 1995, when they found the birds were becoming a nuisance and began discouraging people from feeding wildlife. However, the <b>agile</b> currawongs are adept at snatching fragments of food left by picnickers so the birds may only ultimately be discouraged by an (impractical) ban on food in National Parks. Birds also take other items such as soap or cutlery from campsites to examine.|$|E
5|$|Bryars {{chose to}} {{distinguish}} the character types through the vocal ranges they were given. The adults of the town are largely given deep voices, bass and bass-baritone for the men, contralto and mezzo-soprano for the women. The lovers have high voices, soprano and counter-tenor. In {{order to make the}} scientists sound unlike the townspeople, Bryars made Ox a tenor and Ygène a baritone, both parts being <b>agile,</b> lyric and relatively high in their voice range.|$|E
5|$|During the day, zebra {{sharks are}} {{sluggish}} and usually found {{resting on the}} sea bottom, sometimes using their pectoral fins {{to prop up the}} front part of their bodies and facing into the current with their mouths open to facilitate respiration. Reef channels are favored resting spots, since the tightened space yields faster, more oxygenated water. They become more active at night or when food becomes available. Zebra sharks are strong and <b>agile</b> swimmers, propelling themselves with pronounced anguilliform (eel-like) undulations of the body and tail. In a steady current, they have been seen hovering in place with sinuous waves of their tails.|$|E
5|$|Each {{character}} {{has their own}} unique abilities. Verne has the strength to push and carry large items and can retract into his shell {{in order to avoid}} detection, but cannot jump as high or run as swift as the other characters. RJ has average strength and agility. He can climb, lift items and also throw Verne. Hammy is the most <b>agile</b> of the three, running swifter and jumping higher. This enables him to circumvent security more easily.|$|E
5|$|Fellow revolutionary Panayot Hitov later {{described}} the adult Levski as being of medium height and having an <b>agile,</b> wiry appearance—with light, greyish-blue eyes, blond hair, {{and a small}} moustache. He added that Levski abstained from smoking and drinking. Hitov's memories of Levski's appearance are supported by Levski's contemporaries, revolutionary and writer Lyuben Karavelov and teacher Ivan Furnadzhiev. The only differences are that Karavelov claimed Levski was tall rather than of medium height, while Furnadzhiev noted that his moustache was light brown and his eyes appeared hazel.|$|E
5|$|Large, heavy horses, {{weighing}} from , {{the ancestors}} of today's draught horses, were used, particularly in Europe, from the Middle Ages onward. They pulled heavy loads like supply wagons and were disposed to remain calm in battle. Some historians believe they may have carried the heaviest-armoured knights of the European Late Middle Ages, though others dispute this claim, indicating that the destrier, or knight's battle horse, was a medium-weight animal. It is also disputed whether the destrier class included draught animals or not. Breeds at the smaller end of the heavyweight category may have included {{the ancestors of}} the Percheron, <b>agile</b> for their size and physically able to manoeuvre in battle.|$|E
5|$|Loss of wetland habitat threatens {{dragonfly}} populations {{around the}} world. Dragonflies {{are represented in}} human culture on artifacts such as pottery, rock paintings, and Art Nouveau jewellery. They are used in traditional medicine in Japan and China, and caught for food in Indonesia. They are symbols of courage, strength, and happiness in Japan, but seen as sinister in European folklore. Their bright colours and <b>agile</b> flight are admired in the poetry of Alfred, Lord Tennyson and the prose of H. E. Bates.|$|E
5|$|Monk seals have {{a slender}} body and are <b>agile.</b> They have a broad, flat snout with {{nostrils}} on the top. Monk seals are polygynous, and group together in harems. They feed mainly on bony fish and cephalopods, {{but they are}} opportunistic. The skin is covered in small hair, which are generally black in males and brown or dark gray in females. Monk seals {{are found in the}} Hawaiian archipelago, certain areas in the Mediterranean sea (such as Cabo Blanco and Gyaros island), and formerly in the tropical areas of the west Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|More {{specialized}} carnivores {{include the}} shrewlike rats of the Philippines, which feed on insects and soft-bodied invertebrates, and the Australian water rat, which devours aquatic insects, fish, crustaceans, mussels, snails, frogs, birds' eggs, and water birds. The grasshopper mouse from dry regions of North America feeds on insects, scorpions, {{and other small}} mice, and {{only a small part}} of its diet is plant material. It has a chunky body with short legs and tail, but is <b>agile</b> and can easily overpower prey as large as itself.|$|E
5|$|Most microbats are nocturnal while megabats are {{typically}} diurnal or crepuscular. In temperate areas, bats may migrate hundreds of kilometres to winter hibernation dens, while some pass into torpor in cold weather, rousing and feeding when warm weather allows for insects to be active. Others retreat to caves for winter and hibernate for six months. Microbats rarely fly in rain, it interferes with their echolocation, {{and they are}} unable to locate their food. A few species such as the New Zealand short-tailed bat and the common vampire bat are <b>agile</b> on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Nova {{is highly}} <b>agile,</b> acrobatic, {{and able to}} perform {{maneuvers}} such as mantling and climbing ledges, hanging from pipes, and sliding down ziplines. The player has access to Nova's psionic powers honed through training as a ghost agent, {{such as the ability}} to improve her speed and reflexes drastically. StarCraft: Ghost includes many of the vehicle units featured in StarCraft and StarCraft: Brood War. Some vehicles, such as space battlecruisers and starfighters, only play support roles, while others, such as hoverbikes, scout cars, and futuristic siege tanks, can be piloted by the player.|$|E
5|$|Ostrom's {{description}} of Deinonychus in 1969 {{has been described}} as the most important single discovery of dinosaur paleontology in the mid-20th century. The discovery of this clearly active, <b>agile</b> predator did much to change the scientific (and popular) conception of dinosaurs and opened the door to speculation that dinosaurs may have been warm-blooded. This development has been termed the dinosaur renaissance. Several years later, Ostrom noted similarities between the forefeet of Deinonychus and that of birds, an observation which led him to revive the hypothesis that birds are descended from dinosaurs. Forty years later, this idea is almost universally accepted.|$|E
5|$|Probably the {{earliest}} horses with Arabian bloodlines to enter Europe came indirectly, through Spain and France. Others would have arrived with returning Crusaders—beginning in 1095, European armies invaded Palestine and many knights returned home with Arabian horses as spoils of war. Later, as knights and the heavy, armored war horses who carried them became obsolete, Arabian horses {{and their descendants}} were used to develop faster, <b>agile</b> light cavalry horses {{that were used in}} warfare into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Su-25SM weapon suite {{has been}} {{expanded}} {{with the addition}} of the Vympel R-73 highly <b>agile</b> air-to-air missile (albeit without helmet mounted cuing and only the traditional longitudinal seeker mode) and the S-13T 130mm rockets (carried in five-round B-13 pods) with blast-fragmentation and armour-piercing warheads. Further, the Kh-25ML and Kh-29L Weapon Employment Profiles have been significantly improved, permitting some complex missile launch scenarios to be executed, such as: firing two consecutive missiles on two different targets in a single attack pass. The GSh-30-2 cannon (250-round magazine) has received three new reduced rate-of-fire modes: 750, 375 and 188 Rounds per Minute. The Su-25SM was also given new BD3-25 under-wing pylons.|$|E
5|$|The 2002 {{documentary}} , {{directed by}} James Cameron and filmed in May–June 2002 using {{smaller and more}} <b>agile</b> Mir submersibles, reconstructed the events leading to the sinking. These provided the first interior shots. His findings were {{that there was not}} enough damage below the waterline to confirm that she had been sunk rather than scuttled. Close inspection of the wreckage confirmed that none of the torpedoes or shells had penetrated the second layer of the inner hull. Using small ROVs to examine the interior, Cameron discovered that the torpedo blasts had failed to shatter the torpedo bulkheads.|$|E
5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} is a granivore {{and adapted}} for {{the consumption of}} seedheads, with a conical beak {{to remove the seeds}} and <b>agile</b> feet to grip the stems of seedheads while feeding. It is a social bird, and will gather in large flocks while feeding and migrating. It may behave territorially during nest construction, but this aggression is short-lived. Its breeding season is tied to the peak of food supply, beginning in late July, which is relatively late in the year for a finch. This species is generally monogamous, and produces one brood each year.|$|E
5|$|The F-16E/F is {{outfitted}} with Northrop Grumman's AN/APG-80 {{active electronically scanned array}} (AESA) radar. Northrop Grumman developed the latest AESA radar upgrade for the F-16 (selected for USAF and Taiwan Air Force F-16 upgrades), named the Scalable <b>Agile</b> Beam Radar (SABR). In July 2007, Raytheon {{announced that it}} was developing a Next Generation Radar (RANGR) based on its earlier AN/APG-79 AESA radar as a competitor to Northrop Grumman's AN/APG-68 and AN/APG-80 for the F-16.|$|E
5|$|The State Stud of the Hungarian Royal and Imperial Court, Mezőhegyes, {{was founded}} in 1784 to help meet the demand for horses. At the time, Hungary was home to 1.5 million horses, with the Hungarian cavalry {{requiring}} between 10,000 and 15,000 new mounts per year. Different horses fulfilled different roles: courtiers and aristocrats wanted <b>agile,</b> responsive, impressive riding horses for their military endeavors, resilient mounts for hunting on horseback, and elegant carriage horses. Fulfilling these demands led Mezőhegyes to develop several different breeds and strains: the Arab-influenced Gidrán, half-bred Furioso-North Star, and the heavier Nonius.|$|E
5|$|The YF-23 was stealthier and faster, {{but less}} <b>agile</b> than its competitor. After a {{four-year}} development and evaluation process, the YF-22 was announced {{the winner in}} 1991 and entered production as the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. The U.S. Navy considered using the production version of the ATF {{as the basis for}} a replacement to the F-14, but these plans were later canceled. The two YF-23 prototypes were museum exhibits as of 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{black mamba}} is graceful but skittish and often unpredictable. It is <b>agile</b> and can move quickly, it is shy and secretive by nature and, like most snakes, it avoids threats. In the wild, a black mamba seldom tolerates humans {{approaching}} {{more closely than}} about 40 meters. When confronted {{it is likely to}} gape in a threat display, exposing its black mouth and flicking its tongue. It also is likely to form a hood by spreading its neck-flap as cobras do. The mamba's hood however, is narrower than that of a typical cobra. The threat display may be accompanied by audible hissing.|$|E
5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} {{is mostly}} active {{during the morning}} and the late afternoon, with the hottest hours of the day being spent in rest. These extremely <b>agile</b> and wary animals can run at speeds of up to , waving their tails and tossing their heads. An analysis of the activity of blue wildebeest at the Serengeti National Park showed that the animals devoted over half of their total time to rest, 33% to grazing, 12% to moving about (mostly walking) and a little to social interactions. However, there were variations among different age and sex groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{organisms that}} can be classified as fish were soft-bodied chordates that first appeared during the Cambrian period. Although they lacked a true spine, they possessed notochords which allowed {{them to be more}} <b>agile</b> than their invertebrate counterparts. Fish would continue to evolve through the Paleozoic era, diversifying into a wide variety of forms. Many fish of the Paleozoic developed external armor that protected them from predators. The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian period, after which many (such as sharks) became formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of arthropods.|$|E
