500|$|The {{episode is}} notable for {{featuring}} the first actual kiss between Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. The series had featured other brushes with kisses {{between the two}} leads: in the fourth season episode [...] "Small Potatoes", a shapeshifter, disguised as Mulder, nearly kissed Scully; in the 1998 film, the two's [...] "lips brushed slightly before Scully got stung by a virus-carrying bee"; and in the sixth season entry [...] "Triangle", Mulder kissed a Scully-lookalike from the 1930s in a reverie of his. John Shiban developed {{the idea for a}} Mulder–Scully kiss, which was described by series creator Chris Carter as a [...] "present for the fans." [...] Shiban noted that the episode's kiss felt like [...] "the logical culmination of their relationship. They had been heading toward the kiss for years". Gillian Anderson later explained that, [...] "David [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> kiss was coming. [...] I felt the editors of that episode milked it in a very effective way." [...] In order to create the atmosphere of the scene, specialized camera angles were used and everything was slowed down to make the scene last longer. The Millennium Ball scene was digitally created on a computer because the episode was filmed in October, two months before the event was scheduled to take place. Special effects producer Bill Millar was tasked with digitally adding the number [...] "2000" [...] into archival footage of Dick Clark's 1999 New Years Eve show. Dick Clark was later hired to come in and create a voice-over bit announcing the year 2000.|$|E
2500|$|Reznor also {{released}} multitrack {{files for}} {{a few of the}} songs. [...] In retrospect Reznor said, [...] "That whole idea of putting up multitracks, really was just, several years ago, bored in a hotel room [...] just as an experiment I happened to have the multitracks with me--I think I was doing press for With Teeth--I loaded up [...] "The Hand That Feeds" [...] and made it as a multitrack, in GarageBand. [...] I thought it would be cool to give the sounds to people, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> challenge would be to get that past Interscope, essentially giving the masters out. [...] But they agreed." [...] Reznor has released multitrack files for every major Nine Inch Nails release up to, and including, The Slip.|$|E
2500|$|After {{watching}} Michigan's 12–11 {{victory over}} Chicago in 1898, Louis Elbel, {{who was at}} the time a student in the University of Michigan School of Music, was inspired to write [...] "The Victors," [...] which was later adopted as Michigan's fight song. [...] He reportedly began composing the song at his sister's house in the Englewood section of Chicago and continued the effort on the return train ride from Chicago to Ann Arbor. [...] Elbel's lyric, [...] "Champions of the West," [...] refers to Michigan's having won the Western Conference championship {{for the first time in}} the school's history. [...] Elbel later recalled:"We were crazed with joy. [...] We paraded in the dark. We yelled and followed our U-M Band, singing to the tune of 'Hot Time in the Old Town.' It struck me quite suddenly that such an epic should be dignified by something more elevating, for this was not ordinary victory. [...] My spirits were so uplifted that I was clear off the earth, and that is when 'The Victors' was inspired. I put in a lot of 'hails' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> fellows would get them in with the proper emphasis. Through them, the title suggested itself, and I dedicated it to the Michigan team of 1898." ...|$|E

'Now, {{look you}} here, Tom Gradgrind,' said Bounderby the flushed, confronting {{him with his}} legs wide apart, his hands deeper in his pockets, and his hair like a {{hayfield}} wherein his windy anger was boisterous.

Since you are of opinion that she ought to have what she wants, I recommend you to provide it for her. Because, Tom Gradgrind, she will never have it from me.' ...|$|R
