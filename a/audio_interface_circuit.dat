Using a CS <b>interface</b> <b>circuit</b> instead of a traditional ORing-MOSFET protection circuit in a high-availability parallel power module system can make the load current distribution problem among the non-identical paralleled power modules solved in an "add-in" way with relatively low cost. The applications of the various current-sensing, current-programming and current control techniques can produce many kinds of the CS controllers suitable for the CS <b>interface</b> <b>circuits.</b> The CS <b>interface</b> <b>circuits</b> controlled by different CS controllers possesses different operation characteristics.

For correct operation, an <b>interface</b> <b>circuit</b> must meet strict synchronization timing constraints, and also respect sequencing constraints between events dictated by interfacing protocols and rational clock relations. In this paper, we propose a technique for automatically analyzing the interaction between independently specified synchronization constraints and sequencing constraints between events.
