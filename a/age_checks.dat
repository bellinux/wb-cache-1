5000|$|The game {{includes}} four modes: Brain <b>Age</b> <b>Check,</b> Training, Quick Play, and Sudoku. The Brain <b>Age</b> <b>Check</b> gives the player three puzzles to complete.

5000|$|ATVOD {{only had}} the {{jurisdiction}} {{to take action against}} websites that were based in the UK. Consequently, in 2013 the regulator proposed the introduction of a new licensing system. Licences would have only been granted to websites that had suitable <b>age</b> <b>checks</b> in place. Unlicensed websites would have had their payments from UK customers blocked. Talks between ATVOD and financial institutions including the Payments Council, the British Bankers Association and the UK Cards Association took place in October 2013. Subsequently, ATVOD provided the UK Government and the European Commission with detailed briefings on policy options. In March 2014 ATVOD proposed that legislation should be enacted before the United Kingdom general election, 2015, to forbid credit and debit card operators from processing payments from UK customers to unlicensed websites. This was not done, although the opposition Labour Party expressed support for such legislation. The ASACP described ATVOD's proposed age verification measures as [...] "overbroad" [...] and expressed concern that any consequent legislation could be [...] "overly broad in its definition of adult entertainment content". In October 2014 it was reported that Ministers were drafting legislation to compel adult website companies and credit card providers to carry out <b>age</b> <b>checks</b> on users before allowing access to adult websites. The following month the Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014 amended the Communications Act 2003 to set out statutory and legal obligations for media distributors of on-demand content. The regulations define the content that can legally be distributed under an R18 certificate and make it a criminal offence to not adequately restrict access to such content to those aged over 18. Further proposals were put forward by the Conservative Party in advance of the 2015 UK general election to give an independent regulator such as ATVOD the legal power to compel internet service providers to block sites which failed to include effective age verification. Provisions regarding the creation of an age-verification regulator and the blocking of non-compliant sites subsequently formed part of the Digital Economy Act 2017.|$|E

5|$|Similar to its predecessor, Brain Age 2 is an {{edutainment}} {{video game}} that offers the player several minigames to play. Before the game begins, the player must create a profile, after which Brain <b>Age</b> <b>Check</b> runs three random {{tests to determine}} the player's brain age, which ranges from 20 to 80 and depends on the player's test performance. The brain age determines approximately the responsiveness of the player's brain; a brain age of 20, the lowest age that the player can achieve, indicates that the player's brain is as responsive as that of an average 20-year-old. Once the player is told their initial brain age, three modes are unlocked: Quick Play, Daily Training, and Sudoku. In Quick Play, the player can practice {{with any of the}} available minigames without receiving a score. In Daily Training, the player can perform Brain <b>Age</b> <b>Check</b> to determine their updated brain age. They can also complete one of the available minigames, after which they are given a rating based on their performance. In Daily Training, the player can also play Virus Buster, a simplified version of Dr. Mario (1990) modified for mobile play. To let the player track their progress, the game saves daily statistics of the player's performance, which are shown in a graph. In the third mode, Sudoku, the player can solve one of a hundred Sudoku puzzles.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{focuses on}} how to design a Store Buffer (STB) well suited to first-level multibanked data caches. The goal is to forward data from {{in-flight}} stores into dependent loads within the latency of a cache bank. Taking into account the store lifetime in the processor pipeline and the data forwarding behavior, we propose a particular two-level STB design in which forwarding is done speculatively from a distributed first-level STB made of extremely small banks, whereas a centralized, second-level STB enforces correct store-load ordering. Besides, the two-level STB admits two simplifications that leave performance almost unchanged. Regarding the second-level STB, we suggest to remove its data forwarding capability, while for the first-level STB, it is possible to: 1) remove the instruction <b>age</b> <b>checking</b> and 2) compare only the less significant address bits. Experimentation covers both integer and floating point codes executing in dynamically scheduled processors. Following our guidelines and running SPEC- 2 K over an 8 -way processor, a two-level STB with four 8 -entry banks in the first level performs similar to an ideal, single-level STB with 128 -entry banks working at the first-level cache latency. Also, we show that the proposed two-level design is suitable for a memory-latency-tolerant processor. Index Terms—Cache memories, computer architecture, memory architecture, pipeline processing.

40|$|The {{recovery}} of a 1. 5 million yr long ice core from Antarctica represents a keystone of {{our understanding of}} Quaternary climate, the progression of glaciation over this time period {{and the role of}} greenhouse gas cycles in this progression. Here we tackle the question of where such ice may still be found in the Antarctic ice sheet. We can show that such old ice is most likely to exist in the plateau area of the East Antarctic ice sheet (EAIS) without stratigraphic disturbance and should be able to be recovered after careful presite selection studies. Based on a simple ice and heat flow model and glaciological observations, we conclude that positions in the vicinity of major domes and saddle position on the East Antarctic Plateau will most likely have such old ice in store and represent the best study areas for dedicated reconnaissance studies in the near future. In contrast to previous ice core drill site selections, however, we strongly suggest significantly reduced ice thickness to avoid bottom melting. For example for the geothermal heat flux and accumulation conditions at Dome C, an ice thickness lower than but close to about 2500 m would be required to find 1. 5 Myr old ice (i. e. more than 700 m less than at the current EPICA Dome C drill site). Within this constraint, the resolution of an Oldest-Ice record and the distance of such old ice to the bedrock should be maximized to avoid ice flow disturbances, for example, by finding locations with minimum geothermal heat flux. As the geothermal heat flux is largely unknown for the EAIS, this parameter has to be carefully determined beforehand. In addition, detailed bedrock topography and ice flow history has to be reconstructed for candidates of an Oldest-Ice ice coring site. Finally, we argue strongly for rapid access drilling before any full, deep ice coring activity commences to bring datable samples to the surface and to allow an <b>age</b> <b>check</b> of the oldest ice.
