50|$|A lifelong {{activist and}} educator, Graham F. Smith’s passionate {{commitment}} {{to peace and}} freedom took him <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> the classroom. From his Australian Army experiences in the closing period of the Second World War, where he aided the struggle of the Indonesian people against Dutch colonialism, to his involvement in Cuba, Nicaragua, the Philippines and Vietnam, he always supported the struggle for independence and freedom.|$|E
50|$|Count Gruemon, {{a notorious}} swine, hated mice with a passion. One day, he {{discovered}} a mouse in his castle. Frustrated and irate, Count Gruemon ordered Puss 'N Boots (Pero) {{to find and}} destroy the mouse. However, Pero was a kind-hearted cat and had become friends with the mouse, and so, helped the little creature to escape. In a fit of anger, Count Gruemon, aided by Dr. Gari-gari, a fiendish scientist wolf, sent Pero on a perilous time-travel journey <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> the past.|$|E
5000|$|Jaxon-Bear’s eighteen-year spiritual path {{began after}} the 1971 May Day Protests, {{when he became}} a federal {{fugitive}} during the Vietnam War. As he described, “I was brought face-to-face with death. Through grace, I passed to the other side: I awoke to the truth of my own nature as empty, immortal consciousness.” This experience led him on a spiritual search that took him <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> many traditions and practices. In 1978, Kalu Rinpoche appointed him the president of Kagyu Minjur Choling, the first Kagyu Tibetan Buddhist dharma center in Marin County. In 1982, he was presented with a Zen Teaching Fan at Cho Sho-ji Zen Temple in Beppu, Japan. [...] Through the 1980s, Jaxon-Bear ran a Clinical Hypnosis and Neurolinguistics certification program at the Esalen Institute. Also during that time, he studied the ancient Sufi wisdom teachings of the Enneagram. His first writings and teachings on the Enneagram emerged in 1989. He was a keynote speaker at the first International Enneagram Conference at Stanford University in August, 1994. His talk was entitled “The Enneagram and Self-Realization”.|$|E

5000|$|Early in his career, James H. Cromartie {{reports to}} have often {{surveyed}} the printed works of Andrew Wyeth {{for hours on}} end attempting to decode a technique so seamless it did not even bear the stroke of a brush. It would be years before Cromartie, confident that he had finally mastered Wyeth’s technique, actually stood in front of an original Wyeth only to find the canvas, so immaculately rendered in his books, covered in brush strokes. [...] Thus, in simply attempting to emulate Andrew Wyeth, James H. Cromartie inadvertently spawned Hard-Edge Realism, “launching him on a journey that would take him <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> the company of many of society’s elite.” James H. Cromartie, himself, while accepting the popular use of the term, Hard-Edge Realism, believes his style to be more correctly stated as “surrealistic impressionism.” [...] Cromartie, describes his work in Nantucket Portrait: Fun & Games with the Super Rich the Birth of Hard-Edge Realism thus, [...] “if you compare a photograph with my paintings you would see a great [...] difference. My lighting is better than real life. My composition is better [...] than real life. I add things to the painting that might not actually be there [...] if you took a photograph. Sometimes I leave things out that are there. My [...] paintings have emotion and feeling in them that cannot be captured on film." ...|$|E

40|$|The goal {{is an old}} one: {{find ways}} to promote {{the wealth of the}} nation. It was Smith’s goal in writing An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, {{published}} in 1776. It was Harvard economist Michael Porter’s goal in 1990 when he published The Competitive Advantage of Nations. The two books had similar objectives, and surprisingly similar conclusions. Porter quickly became the prophet of {{what seemed to be a}} new gospel called the “cluster approach”, which he calls “a new way of thinking ” about economic development. Cluster theory has spread <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> some surprising corners. In Sudbury alone in the past year there have been eight Cluster events (see Table 1). There have also been articles in the local newspaper (including one on the Sudbury Bar Cluster by ex Laurentian Student, Laura Stradiato, and a full page article by Stan Sudol, a Toronto Media consultant who grew up in Sudbury), several pieces on the INORD websites, and editorials promoting the cluster approach.
