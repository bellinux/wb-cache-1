6000|$|Then illogical Belfast reproached our nigger {{with great}} fury. James Wait, with his elbow on the pillow, choked, gasped out:--"Did I {{ask you to}} bone the dratted thing? Blow your blamed pie. It has made me worse--you little Irish lunatic, you!" [...] Belfast, with scarlet face and {{trembling}} lips, made a dash at him. Every man in the forecastle rose with a shout. There {{was a moment of}} wild tumult. Some one shrieked piercingly:--"Easy, Belfast! Easy!..." [...] We expected Belfast to strangle Wait without more ado. Dust flew. We heard through it the nigger's cough, metallic and explosive like a gong. Next moment we saw Belfast hanging over him. He was saying plaintively:--"Don't! Don't, Jimmy! Don't be like that. An angel couldn't put up with ye--sick as ye are." [...] He looked round at us from Jimmy's bedside, his comical mouth twitching, and through tearful eyes; then he tried to put straight the disarranged blankets. The unceasing whisper of the sea filled the forecastle. Was James Wait frightened, or touched, or repentant? He lay on his back with a hand to his side, and as motionless as if his expected visitor had come at last. Belfast fumbled about his feet, repeating with emotion:--"Yes. We know. Ye are bad, but.... Just say what ye want done, and.... We all know ye are bad--very bad...." [...] No! Decidedly James Wait was not touched or repentant. Truth to say, he seemed rather startled. He sat up with incredible suddenness and ease. [...] "Ah! You think I am bad, do you?" [...] he said gloomily, in his clearest baritone voice (to hear him speak sometimes you would never think there was <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> man). [...] "Do you?... Well, act according! Some of you haven't sense enough to put a blanket shipshape over a sick man. There! Leave it alone! I can die anyhow!" [...] Belfast turned away limply with a gesture of discouragement. In the silence of the forecastle, full of interested men, Donkin pronounced distinctly:--"Well, I'm blowed!" [...] and sniggered. Wait looked at him. He looked at him in a quite friendly manner. Nobody could tell what would please our incomprehensible invalid: but for us the scorn of that snigger was hard to bear.|$|E

We endeavour {{to answer these questions}} by appeal to the work of two of the most prominent philosophers of science of the twentieth century, namely Popper and Kuhn.

We then show that these rules are often broken in the way that research is publicly funded in the UK...|$|R

5000|$|Dawn Teresa of New Release Tuesday {{called it}} a [...] "scripture-soaked record full of the good news of the Gospel", and found the album to be [...] "musically diverse, there are many styles present and {{sometimes}} blended: pop/rock, jazz, folk, worship, and gospel", which [...] "the songs may not all grab you immediately--they aren't short, catchy pop tunes--and some may be better suited to corporate worship and personal listening than radio."

5000|$|Maxine Headley of BBC Music claimed: [...] "In {{the same}} way that hip hop's current state of health has been {{recently}} questioned, the debate of whether or not Grime has a future is generating many heated discussions. Prominent icons are seemingly moving away from the genre - Kano's doing the hip hop thing, Dizzie Rascal's collaborating with the MySpace successes, Lily Allen and Arctic Monkey's, to sustain mainstream interest, and the 'Godfather of Grime', Wiley, is retiring - the need for a new ally to march the movement forward is essential.Step up Tinchy Styder, who after several mix tapes finally releases his debut album, Star In The Hood, in an attempt to see if grime really does pay. And you know what, it just might. Yes, fans that have known Tinch from the beginning will hear him tone down his fiery musical 'tantrums' on some of the tracks, in order to obtain mass appeal. Looking no further than the DaVinChe produced single 'Something About Your Smile', its catchy hook and upbeat tempo has all the signs of a successful pop song. Really, there isn't <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>that,</b> Tinch hasn't totally deserted those who have made him a 'household name' in fact much of the lyrical content is still grimy, notably on 'Not Like Me' where he declares his originality as an artist, as with the title track 'Star In The Hood' claiming, well, the same thing. However the effort in 'keeping it real' on 'Catch 'Em' doesn't help dispel the current issues of how inner city youths get caught up in unnecessary life threatening altercations. Lucky, the inclusion of female vocals creates diversity on the album; 'Hands Of Time' with its reggae undertones and sentimental message show a softer side to Tinch, while 'Stereotypes' featuring and produced by Goldielocks, commands you not to assume 'we're some wasted kids, who aint got a clue about the music biz'. A Grime album wouldn't be a Grime album without a boisterous MC talking about his takeover of the world. Soldier on a mission, we salute you!" ...|$|E

40|$|Australia has {{recently}} amended copyright laws {{in order to}} exempt and protect parodies, so that, as the Hon. Chris Ellison, the then Minster for Justice told the Senate,‘Australia’s fine tradition of poking fun at itself and others will not be unnecessarily restricted’. It is predicted {{that there will be}} legal debates about the definition of parody. But if the law, as the Minister contends, reflects Australian values, then there is a precursor question. Is there <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> parody, such <b>that</b> it should be restricted? In their efforts to define parody, Paul Jewell and Jennie Louise discover and develop a moral defence of parody. Parody is the imitation of an artistic work, sometimes for the sake of ridicule, or perhaps as a vehicle to make a criticism or comment. It is the appropriation of another’s original work, and therefore, prima facie, exploits the originator. Parody is the unauthorised use of intellectual property, with both similarity to and difference from other misappropriations such as piracy, plagiarism and forgery. Nevertheless, we argue that unlike piracy, plagiarism and forgery, which are inherently immoral, parody is not. On the contrary, parody makes a positive contribution to culture and even to the original artists whose work is parodied.

5000|$|In 2014, {{incumbent}} State Representative Karen Castor Dentel, a Democrat, ran {{for re-election}} in the 30th District, so Cortes ran against her. He faced Seminole County Soil and Water Conservation District Supervisor Scott Sturgill in the Republican primary, and he campaigned on reducing taxes and regulations for businesses, on his support for charter schools, and on his plan to provide parents homeschooling their children with funding to do so. The Orlando Sentinel, though criticizing both Cortes and Sturgill as candidates who [...] "largely walk in lock step on most GOP stances," [...] endorsed Cortes, praising the [...] "strength of his municipal experience" [...] overseeing Longwood's twenty million dollar budget. In the end, Cortes ended up winning the primary by a wide margin, defeating Sturgill with 57% of the vote. He advanced to the general election, where he faced Castor Dentel, and a contentious campaign ensued. Cortes attacked Castor Dentel for her focus on public education, saying, [...] "Pretty much all the bills she's put forward have been geared towards education. Not <b>that</b> there's <b>anything</b> particularly <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>that,</b> but...other issues affect our district and our state." [...] He campaigned on his support for lower taxes and regulations, though he defended his {{vote in favor of}} increasing property taxes while on the City Commission. During the campaign, Cortes was attacked for not actually living inside the district while he was campaigning, as Longwood, where {{he was elected to the}} City Commission, was in the neighboring 29th District, and as a result, he ended up resigning his City Commission seat and moved into Altamonte Springs. Groups supporting Cortes attacked Castor Dentel for allegedly voting to defund public education, based on the fact that she voted against the state's budget, an attack that Orlando Sentinel columnist Scott Maxwell called [...] "slimy." [...] During the campaign, the Orlando Sentinel endorsed Castor Dentel over Cortes, noting that while Cortes is [...] "sincere and civic-minded," [...] he was [...] "not in Castor Dentel's league." [...] Ultimately, Cortes defeated Castor Dentel, winning 51% of the vote to her 49%. On 1/27/2016, Bob Cortes voted to allow fracking in Florida.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} report outlines the rationale, the aims and objectives, planning, theoretical context and findings of an installation examining {{the presentation of}} silence. The practice of curation was used in order to establish, through the juxtapositioning of found and made objects drawn from personal archive, signs and representations of silence so that a language that is common could be created or found. The initial overarching question was whether {{it was possible to}} present silence by creating a visual language, using curation that became understandable to an audience without having to refer to explanation beyond what was presented to them. Meaning is by nature layered, in that it is socially constructed but adjusted by personal identity, experience, gender, social circumstances and history, and can change over time. Questions that were grappled with included whether interpretation is culturally driven, and what pains the curator had in choosing work to put on display which would drive meaning and the telling of the story as it were. By extension then questions emerged as to whose voice is being fore grounded in the act of curating. This could be the curator’s alone but this then begs the question as to where the voice of the original artist sits. If it was the curator’s voice alone that emerged then questions needed to be asked if there is <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> The presentation, simply {{by the nature of the}} objects displayed, had a sense of layered meaning, but it was important that the layers were not so deeply embedded as to make singular meaning to individual viewers not apparent. This research project is the culmination of a body of work undertaken over two years. It began as one thing, moved quickly into something else, turned in on itself and again became something somewhat different, finally spiralling unexpectedly back to its original form. The initial point of departure for this research was the state of silence that I found I had been living in for most of my life. This included silence, and the subsequent guilt, over Apartheid, silence and helplessness in the face of violence and corruption in South Africa, and the silence that I was subjected to as a girl growing up in a patriarchal society, which was later impacted by coming out as a lesbian. The silence that I initially proposed to present in this research was a quiet spiritual silence that I hoped would reveal itself as the work progressed, not the silence of collusion or violence that so often presents itself in readings of this topic. The research began as an extension of a small shadow puppet play that examined the plight of the rhino, and his silenced voice, which was itself an extension of the initial point of departure as outlined above. The journey emerged from a thought, which materialized into a puppet play, morphed and evolved into an art installation and finally, on reflection, became something else altogether. Whilst visiting the Netherlands I came across two exhibitions in Utrecht both dealing with silence. None of the work in either of the exhibitions spoke of silence to me. This led me to question whether I lacked the language that was needed in order to receive the messaging that the various artists were trying to convey, or whether they lacked the ability to convey their messages. Other questions began to emerge, such as: How is silence constructed? Is it possible to create a language that can be shared by audiences that can engage them with notions of silence? How would a South African audience experience silence, since so much around us is socially constructed? Was it because I was a foreigner, and therefore viewed silence as a South African would, that I was not able to engage with the work in the Netherlands, or was it because the artists were simply unable to share a language with me...|$|E
