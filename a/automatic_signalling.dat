5|$|While {{the power}} station was being built, the District {{electrified}} the Ealing to Harrow line {{that was not}} yet open. It was equipped with <b>automatic</b> <b>signalling</b> using track circuits and pneumatic semaphore signals, and trials were run with two seven car trains. In August 1903, an order was placed for 420 cars and a new maintenance depot was built west of Mill Hill Park (now Acton Town).|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{scheme was}} introduced, {{using a combination}} of <b>automatic</b> <b>signalling</b> and modifications to the layout at Liverpool Street. The station introduced coaling, watering, and other maintenance facilities directly at the station, as well as separate engine bays and a modified track and station layout that reduced turnaround times and increased productivity. Services began on 2 July 1920 with trains to Chingford and Enfield running every 10 minutes. The cost of the modifications was £80,000 compared to an estimated £3million for electrification. The service was officially called the Intensive Service (as it allowed a 50% increase in capacity on peak services), but became popularly known as the Jazz Service. It lasted until the General Strike of 1926, following which services generally declined.|$|E
25|$|The Wairarapa line used {{four of the}} six New Zealand railway {{signalling}} systems: Double Line Automatic (DLA), Centralised Traffic Control (CTC), Track Warrant Control (TWC) and Station Limits. Signalling at Petone is future-proofed for {{conversion to}} a fifth system, <b>Automatic</b> <b>Signalling</b> Rules (ASR).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Automatic</b> - <b>Automatic</b> <b>signals</b> {{are governed}} by logic {{connected}} through electrical track circuits which detect the presence of trains or obstructions automatically. <b>Automatic</b> <b>signals</b> are permissive with their most restrictive aspect {{being one of the}} [...] "Restricted Proceed" [...] variety. Trains can pass an <b>automatic</b> <b>signal</b> displaying [...] "Restricted Proceed" [...] without any outside permission. <b>Automatic</b> <b>signals</b> are typically recognized by having an attached number plate and in older practice, having multiple signal heads offset from each other on the mast (i.e., {{on opposite sides of the}} mast).|$|R
50|$|Originally an {{electric}} token system was used, which {{was replaced by}} half <b>automatic</b> <b>signal</b> locking and finally, as the country's first children's railroad, with <b>automatic</b> <b>signal</b> locking. The diesel locomotive TU2-029 was used since 1971 and the TU2-127 since 1982. In 2009 the diesel locomotive TU7A-3351 and several new carriages were acquired and in 2011 the diesel locomotive TU10-005.|$|R
50|$|Between April and May 1969, {{the line}} Paris-Pontoise was {{electrified}} and <b>automatic</b> <b>signals</b> were installed.|$|R
25|$|Fixed block {{signalling}} {{has been used}} throughout the subway system since the opening of Toronto's first subway in 1954. Along with <b>automatic</b> <b>signalling,</b> used to prevent rear-end train collision, interlocking signals are used to prevent collisions from conflicting movements on track crossovers.|$|E
25|$|In 1897, the Lumière {{brothers}} filmed Liverpool, {{including what}} {{is believed to}} be the world's first tracking shot, taken from the Liverpool Overhead Railway, the world's first elevated electrified railway. The Overhead Railway was the first railway in the world to use electric multiple units, the first to employ <b>automatic</b> <b>signalling,</b> and the first to install an escalator.|$|E
25|$|Most {{lines in}} Melbourne operate under an {{automatic}} block system of safeworking with three-position power signalling. This permits signals to operate automatically {{with the passage}} of trains, enforcing the distance between them. At junctions signals are manually controlled from signal boxes, with interlockings used to ensure conflicting paths are not set. The Flemington Racecourse line has two-position <b>automatic</b> <b>signalling,</b> a variant of the three-position system.|$|E

25|$|There was {{a maximum}} of four cars per train in 1904 and this was raised to five cars in 1909. In 1923 <b>automatic</b> <b>signalling</b> was {{commissioned}} at Liverpool Central and in 1927 the island platform was widened, the work being completed in a weekend. The maximum number of cars in a train was raised to six in 1936, after the tunnels at {{the east end of}} Liverpool Central were extended.|$|E
25|$|Six {{signalling}} {{systems are}} used in New Zealand: <b>automatic</b> <b>signalling</b> rules (ASR), double line automatic (DLA), single line automatic (SLA), centralised traffic control (CTC), track warrant control (TWC), and station limits. Signals are of the colour light type and operate on speed signalling principals, i.e. signals tell the driver what speed they should proceed, but not necessarily the route they will take. The Auckland suburban network is also equipped with European Train Control System (ETCS) Level 1 signalling and train protection.|$|E
25|$|Electric train {{services}} {{between the}} city and Essendon were inaugurated in 1919, with electrification extended to Broadmeadows in 1921. However, Essendon remained the terminus of most suburban services, with a shuttle service operating beyond until 1925, with all day through services to Broadmeadows not provided until 1941. The station took the layout it has today in 1969, with {{the abolition of the}} centre track, closure of the stand-alone signal box, provision of <b>automatic</b> <b>signalling</b> along the line, and replacement of the Buckley Street interlocked crossing gates with boom barriers.|$|E

50|$|The {{total length}} of {{railroad}} network is 21640.4 km. The length of electrified railroad is 9878 km. There are 1,447 train station that have 118 various station buildings. There are 2,268 various smaller stops. The infrastructure also contains 5,422 rail crossings (level crossing), 4,168 {{of which have}} <b>automatic</b> <b>signaling</b> system. At the same time 1,497 rail crossings are manned 1,468 out of those equipped with <b>automatic</b> <b>signaling</b> system (grade crossing signals).|$|R
50|$|On {{the open}} decks of cargo ships, the signals are {{triggered}} by the <b>automatic</b> <b>signal</b> generator and generated by the general alarm system can either be produced by thewhistle or by sirens. The sirens shall be located at uniform distances spread over the open deck. It shall be possible to interrupt the driving of the whistle by the <b>automatic</b> <b>signal</b> generator {{by means of a}} non-locking pushbutton or a switch or a locking pushbutton.|$|R
25|$|Central line – The Central {{line was}} the first line to be modernized in the 1990s, with 85 new 1992-stock trains and a new <b>automatic</b> <b>signalling</b> system {{installed}} to allow Automatic Train Operation. The line runs 34 trains per hour {{for half an hour}} in the morning peak but is unable to operate more frequently {{because of a lack of}} additional trains. The 85 existing 1992-stock trains are the most unreliable on the London Underground as they are equipped with the first generation of solid state direct current thyristor control traction equipment. The trains often break down, have to be withdrawn from service at short notice and at times are not available when required, leading to gaps in service at peak times. Although relatively modern and well within their design life, the trains need work in the medium term to ensure the continued reliability of the traction control equipment and maintain fleet serviceability until renewal, which is expected between 2028 and 2032. Major work is to be undertaken on the fleet to ensure their continued reliability with brakes, traction control systems, doors, automatic control systems being repaired or replaced among other components. The Central line will be part of the New Tube for London Project. This will replace the existing fleet with new air-cooled walkthrough trains and a new more up-to-date <b>automatic</b> <b>signalling</b> system. The line is predicted to run 36 trains per hour, a 25% increase compared to the present service of 34 trains for busiest 30 minutes in the morning and evening peaks and the 27–30 train per hour service for the rest of the peak.|$|E
500|$|The BS used a Westinghouse <b>automatic</b> <b>signalling</b> system {{operated}} through electric track circuits. This controlled signals {{based on}} {{the presence or absence}} of a train on the track ahead. Signals incorporated an arm that was raised when the signal was red. If a train failed to stop at a red signal, the arm activated a [...] "tripcock" [...] on the train, applying the brakes automatically.|$|E
2500|$|The new {{units were}} {{delivered}} through 1940, {{and the old}} cars {{were removed from the}} line on 25 October 1940, the new cars starting work on 28 October, with the line closed over the intervening weekend. The [...] third rail installation had been progressive since January, with the rail put in place but not made live. New <b>automatic</b> <b>signalling</b> with trainstops was also commissioned, although Waterloo signal box was retained. The City signal box was abolished, and fully automatic working implemented there; the lay-by sidings there were abolished. The new stock did not require travelling conductors, and tickets were issued at the terminals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>signals</b> {{are used}} on lines {{equipped}} with <b>automatic</b> block <b>signaling.</b> Their colour language {{is the same}} as aspects S1-S5 of semi-automatic signals. The main difference regards the S1 (red) aspect - After stopping, it can be passed but the subsequent maximum speed is limited to 20 km/h.|$|R
50|$|Triggering of the <b>automatic</b> <b>signal</b> {{generator}} shall only {{be provided}} on the navigating bridge. A “strategic point” has been accurately defined in LSA Code, App. 7.2.|$|R
50|$|It {{shall be}} {{possible}} to trigger the alarms both via an <b>automatic</b> <b>signal</b> generator or by hand. The alarms may be interrupted temporarily by announcements made over the loudspeakerinstallation.|$|R
2500|$|While trains only {{operated}} as {{far north}} as Upper Hutt, they were not protected by fixed signals. [...] It was felt that as services were few, slow, and operated only in daylight hours, signals were not necessary. [...] Upper Hutt {{was one of the first}} stations on the Wairarapa Line to receive signals, with initial instructions requiring south-bound trains to wait in the siding or loop, and north-bound trains to take the main line. [...] These signals were first listed in the working timetables of 1887. [...] By 1921, increased traffic was causing operational issues, and it was decided to install new <b>automatic</b> <b>signalling</b> which had been recently developed in the United States. [...] Work began in 1921, and by early 1923 was operating between Wellington and Upper Hutt.|$|E
50|$|Ringwood to Croydon was {{converted}} to <b>automatic</b> <b>signalling</b> in November 1973 and duplicated in June 1984. Mooroolbark to Lilydale {{was converted}} to <b>automatic</b> <b>signalling</b> in June 1985.|$|E
50|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>signalling,</b> {{which had}} reached Box Hill in 1929, was finally {{extended}} to Blackburn on 13 July 1958. However, <b>automatic</b> <b>signalling</b> was not installed between Blackburn and Mitcham until 13 November 1960. Boom barriers replaced hand gates at Blackburn Road in 1970.|$|E
5000|$|The current station {{building}} on the Platform 1 was opened in 1920, with a tile roof in the [...] "Gisborne style", and in 1936, a new waiting shed and ticket office replaced earlier structures on Platform 2. Boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the Poplar Road level crossing in 1971, when <b>automatic</b> <b>signaling</b> reached the station from Jewell, with <b>automatic</b> <b>signaling</b> extended to Macaulay in 1972. The Inner Circle line (by then a goods-only stub to Fitzroy) was closed in 1981, and the waiting shed on Platform 2 was destroyed by arson in 1989. The signal box on Platform 1 closed in 1994.|$|R
50|$|The radar speed gun {{was invented}} by John L. Barker Sr., and Ben Midlock, who {{developed}} radar for the military while working for the <b>Automatic</b> <b>Signal</b> Company (later <b>Automatic</b> <b>Signal</b> Division of LFE Corporation) in Norwalk, CT during World War II. Originally, <b>Automatic</b> <b>Signal</b> was approached by Grumman Aircraft Corporation to solve the specific problem of terrestrial landing gear damage on the now-legendary PBY Catalina amphibious aircraft. Barker and Midlock cobbled a Doppler radar unit from coffee cans soldered shut to make microwave resonators. The unit was installed {{at the end of}} the runway (at Grumman's Bethpage, NY facility), and aimed directly upward to measure the sink rate of landing PBYs. After the war, Barker and Midlock tested radar on the Merritt Parkway. In 1947, the system was tested by the Connecticut State Police in Glastonbury, Connecticut, initially for traffic surveys and issuing warnings to drivers for excessive speed. Starting in February 1949, the state police began to issue speeding tickets based on the speed recorded by the radar device. In 1948, radar was also used in Garden City, New York.|$|R
25|$|June 10, 2004: Service {{suspended}} at Shilong Road, Longcao Road and Caoxi Road for <b>automatic</b> <b>signal</b> {{system testing}} and restoration of land subsidence at these three stations. Service was restored at these stations on July 24.|$|R
