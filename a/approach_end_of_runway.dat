The U.S. Army Reserve also maintains an Army Aviation Support Facility (AASF) at PIE immediately west of the <b>approach</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>Runway</b> 17R for Companies A and F, 5th Battalion, 159th Aviation Regiment and Medical Evacuation Unit, operating UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters.|$|E
25|$|On April 28, 2016, Massport {{approved}} {{funding for}} the installation of a Category IIIb instrument landing system at ORH. The geographic location of the airport, {{on top of the}} tallest hill in the city reaching approximately 1,000 feet above sea level, leaves Worcester on average with 40 more days of fog a year than nearby Boston. The installation of the Category IIIb landing system will allow aircraft to land and depart in virtually all weather conditions. There are no Category IIIc airports in the United States; it is simply not allowed for safety reasons. The installation of the landing system also will include a jug-handle taxiway at the <b>approach</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>Runway</b> 11. Construction has begun and the ILS is expected to be operational sometime in late 2017. Once it is completed, new service with JetBlue Airways will begin to John F. Kennedy International Airport.|$|E
25|$|Twelve {{seconds before}} the plane hit the mountain, named El Diluvio (The Deluge), the Ground Proximity Warning System activated, announcing an {{imminent}} terrain collision and sounding an alarm. Within a second of this warning the first officer disengaged the autopilot, and the captain attempted to climb clear of the mountain; however, neither pilot had remembered to disengage the previously deployed speed brakes, which reduced the rate of climb. At 9:41:28 pm Eastern Standard Time it struck trees at about 8,900 feet MSL {{on the east side}} of the mountain. The crash was six miles south of Tuluá VOR and 28 miles north of the <b>approach</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>runway</b> 19 at Alfonso Bonilla Aragon International Airport. During the investigations, it was found that neither the Boeing fixed-base simulator nor the CDU/FMS simulator could be backdriven with the data obtained directly from the accident airplane's flight data recorder. Because the B-757 flight simulators could not be backdriven during the tests, it could not be determined with precision whether the airplane would have missed the mountain/tree tops if the speedbrakes had been retracted during the escape attempt. However, the final report stated that if the flightcrew had retracted the speedbrakes one second after initiating the escape maneuver, the airplane could have been climbing through a position that was 150 feet above the initial impact point. Because the airplane would have continued to climb and had the potential to increase its rate of climb, it might well have cleared the trees at the top of the mountain.|$|E

50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board report {{determined}} {{that the cause of}} the accident was the failure of the pilot-in-command to exercise good judgment when he failed to execute a missed approach and continued a non-precision approach to a landing without adequately assessing the aircraft's position relative to the runway threshold. Contributing to the accident were the excessive height and speed at which he crossed the <b>approach</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>runway</b> and the failure of other flight crew members to provide him with required callouts.

5000|$|The {{concept of}} downbursts {{were not yet}} {{understood}} when Flight 66 crashed. During the investigation, meteorologist Ted Fujita worked with the NTSB and the Eastern Airlines flight safety department to study the weather phenomena encountered by Flight 66. Fujita identified [...] "cells of intense downdrafts" [...] during the storm which caused aircraft flying through them [...] "considerable difficulties in landing". Fujita named this phenomenon [...] "downburst cells" [...] and determined that a plane can be [...] "seriously affected" [...] by [...] "a downburst of air current". Fujita proposed new methods of detecting and identifying downbursts, including installation of additional weather monitoring equipment at the <b>approach</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> active <b>runways,</b> and also proposed development of new procedures for immediately communicating downburst detection to incoming aircraft.|$|R
50|$|On August 18, 1993, an American International Airways, Inc. Douglas DC-8-61 (N814CK), {{with three}} crew members on board struck level terrain 1,400 feet west <b>of</b> the <b>approach</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>runway</b> while landing at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The {{aircraft}} approached {{from the south}} and was making a right turn for runway 10 with an increasing angle of bank in order to align with the runway. At 200-300 feet AGL the wings started to rock towards wings level and the nose pitched up. The right wing appeared to stall, the aircraft rolled to 90-degree angle of bank and the nose pitched down. Probable cause of the accident attributed primarily to the impaired judgment, decision-making, and flying abilities of the captain and flight crew due to the effects of fatigue resulting from extended flight/duty hours.|$|R
