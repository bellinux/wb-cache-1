25|$|At the {{instigation}} of Christian Friedrich Schönbein, the Voluntary Museum Association of Basel (Freiwilliger Museumsverein) {{was initiated}} in 1850 as {{the successor to}} an earlier association founded in 1841 {{for the construction of}} the museum. Modelled after the Royal Institution in London, it was established to “stimulate the appreciation of science and art”. Open to all residents of Basel, the association promoted the collections with financial means and sought to generate interest in the museum through public lectures to which women were also admitted. It was unable to sustain the initial enthusiasm, however, and experienced losses in membership despite Basel’s rapid population growth {{in the latter half of}} the century. The museum did not embrace the function of popular education that had been promoted by its founders and supporters. The ideational socialization role of the museum was very slow to proceed, with the museum long holding onto former organizational structures. The art collection furthermore did not get an academically trained conservator until 1887. In addition, the renewed University Act of 1866 discontinued regular state appropriations for the antiquarian, medieval and art collections and left them dependent on proceeds from entry fees and the support of associations and private individuals, the most significant of these being the Birrmann Foundation and the Emilie Linder Foundation on behalf of the art collection. It was this support that enabled an <b>active</b> <b>collection</b> policy that went beyond the receipt of inherited cultural assets.|$|E

Therefore, the state gives responsibility to the tax authorities to act as a law enforcement agent in the field of taxation, include a tax collection action. With the act of tax <b>collection,</b> especially <b>active</b> tax <b>collection,</b> it is expected that the taxpayer or tax insurer pay of the tax debt, so that the optimal tax revenue can be achieved.

40|$|Several {{techniques}} used to eliminate viruses from cassava are described, namely heat therapy, apical tissue culture, and micropropagation. Virological tests to index cassava viruses are also indicated as follows: ELISA, dsRNA, mechanical inoculation of leaf sap in plants on Chenopodium quinoa, and grafting trials. Clones submitted to pathogenic tests {{can be maintained}} in vitro, avoiding the recontamination with pathogenic organisms. The interrelations existing between the different forms of in vitro conservation of cassava germplasm {{and the elimination of}} diseases, micropropagation, distribution, and traditional conservation through seed and field plantations (basic vs. <b>active</b> <b>collections)</b> are indicated. The use of in vitro clonal propagation in cassava and the combination of different techniques to satisfy all multiplication needs are discussed, namely micropropagation through single-node cultures, multiple shoot culture, and somatic embryogenesis. Several examples are given that illustrate that rehabilitation of regional cassava cv. is a strategy to produce cassava in the poorer regions of the tropics in the short term. (CIAT...|$|R

50|$|The society {{created the}} Vega Medal in 1881 on the {{occasion}} of Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld's return to Stockholm, after he had discovered the North East Passage. Since then, the Vega Medal has been awarded to a physical geographer roughly every three years. In the intervening years, the society awarded the Anders Retzius Medal to a human geographer or an anthropologist. In 2015, however, it was decided that awarding a medal named after Retzius wasn't appropriate anymore, considering that his racial studies (that included the <b>active</b> <b>collection</b> of skulls from indigenous peoples) are met with disapproval by modern anthropologists. Instead, the SSAG medal was given to Didier Fassin in 2016. The awards are handed out by the king of Sweden on 24 April, the anniversary of Nordenskiöld's return to Stockholm.|$|E
