40|$|With the {{aggravation}} of {{acid rain}} pollution and the enlarging of the acid rain regions in China, the sensitivity evaluation of natural waters to acidification on a regional scale become increasingly important. Acidification models based on a single indicator cannot give much information on aquatic acidification because of their simplicity; yet acidification models based on physical, chemical, hydrological and/or biological processes are not suitable for large scale regional research because of their exceptional complexity. In this paper, a multi-indicator comprehensive model for aquatic <b>acidification</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is proposed and applied. This model comprises {{some of the most}} important factors that are considered to influence water acidification, in particular: acid neutralization capacity, acidification capacity, acidification sensitive index, cation exchange capacity of soil, pH of soil, and weathering shuck types of soil-forming. It highlights the key stages of aquatic acidification by acid neutralization capacity, acidification capacity, and <b>acidification</b> <b>sensitivity</b> index. The model thereby estimates the <b>acidification</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of natural waters by using these indicators according to a weighting system. Equal-weight and non-equal-weight approaches are separately used to combine the six indicators into an overall sensitivity index of aquatic acidification. The result derived from an application to China on a national scale indicates the practicability of this approach. In China, the sensitive natural waters emerge in Southern China, which is already a heavy acid rain region, and in Northeastern China where the rainwater is beginning to become much acidic...|$|E
40|$|A highly {{sensitive}} fluorimetric procedure based on alkylation of nicotinamide is described for {{the determination of}} aliphatic epoxides. Subsequent reaction of the resulting N-alkylni-cotinamides with a ketone in basic medium yields strongly fluorescent products after final <b>acidification.</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> of the assay is in the picomole range with good reproducibility. The alkylation reaction proceeds under physiological conditions and thus shows potential {{for the analysis of}} epoxides in biological materials.

40|$|The {{acidification}} capacity {{model is}} mainly {{used for the}} classification and the regional partitioning of the <b>acidification</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of natural waters. The theoretical calculation system of the acidification capacity from the conventional monitoring items, such as alkalinity, chemical oxygen demand and pH value, is established by simulating the acidification process of natural waters. In this study, {{the contributions of the}} organic acids and the dissolved aluminum to acidification capacity are discussed respectively, and the different acidification processes for natural waters are included. The calculation result for a typical watershed shows that the values of acidification capacity deriving from the different acidification processes differ from each other. It shows that the acidification processes of natural waters are complex and the establishment of a theoretical calculation system of the acidification capacity is necessary. This approach provides a methodological basis for using Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System to resolve regional environmental problems. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn acid waters {{sensitivity}} map {{has been}} widely used as a background resource for assessing potential impacts of forest management on stream water acidity within Wales. The validity of this approach has been explored by comparing predicted acid sensitivity with the observed acid neutralisation capacity (ANC) in stream runoff using data sets from two regional surveys of a major area of acidification concern in Wales. For catchments in excess of 20 ha, the acid sensitivity predictions are generally upheld, although biologically important extremes of acidity are not predicted. For smaller catchments of 2 to 5 ha area, the large observed variations in ANC are poorly predicted from the acid sensitivity map; there is no statistically significant relationship between predicted sensitivity and measured baseflow and stormflow ANC values for the catchments. This reflects {{the high degree of}} heterogeneity within catchments and the complexity of soil and groundwater interactions. The maps offer a starting point for assessing sensitivity. However, they provide no more than a very crude indication at the scale of interest to forestry managers. It is concluded that a more appropriate route for assessing sensitivity is via field measurement and the direct use of water quality and biological information.

40|$|We have cloned a novel {{member of}} the tandem pore K+ channel family from human brain cDNA. The novel cDNA encodes a 330 -residue {{polypeptide}} of predicted molecular mass 36 kDa. We have named the channel TASK- 5 owing to its sequence homology with TASK- 1 and TASK- 3. TASK- 5 mRNA is expressed in pancreas, liver, kidney. lung, ovary, testis and heart. However, expression of TASK- 5 in heterologous systems failed to elicit ionic currents. Removal of a putative endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence did not alter this finding {{and the distribution of}} channel proteins in HEK 293 cells was similar for both TASK- 1 and TASK- 5. We tested whether TASK- 5 could form heteromers with TASK- 1. We show a mutant form of TASK- 1 (H 98 N) to have a radically reduced <b>sensitivity</b> to <b>acidification.</b> Proton <b>sensitivity</b> could be rescued by injecting equimolar amounts of wild-type and mutant TASK- 1 cRNA into Xenopus oocytes; the effect was that expected if half the channels formed are heteromers. Co-expression of TASK- 5 with TASK- 1 H 98 N does not affect the proton sensitivity of mutant TASK- 1 : thus TASK- 5 appears not to form heteromers with TASK- 1. Nonetheless. TASK- 5 may require some other, unidentified partner subunit to form functional channels in the plasma membrane or it may form a channel in an intracellular organelle...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{specification}} of pollution abatement in dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models and analyses the dynamic feedback mechanisms between economic variables and abatement {{in the context of}} environmental policy. A dynamic small-open-economy model is presented, in which bottom-up technical and economic information on abatement techniques is integrated in a top-down CGE-approach. The practical suitability of the specification is illustrated in an empirical application for the Netherlands focusing on climate change and <b>acidification.</b> Finally, the <b>sensitivity</b> analysis focuses on the impact of the assumptions underlying the specification of emissions and abatement. The results show that the specification of the environmental issues is highly relevant for the calculation of the economic costs of environmental policy. This holds especially for the specification of climate change abatement options, since controlling the emissions of greenhouse gasses leads to significant economic costs, which depend largely on the availability of technological options for emission reduction.

40|$|Based on minimal information, {{lakes in}} the western Canadian provinces of Manitoba (MB) and Saskatchewan (SK) have long been {{considered}} unaffected by acid rain. However, emissions of acidifying pollutants from MB smelters and oil sand processing in Alberta (AB) may pose a developing threat. Surveys of 347 lakes located on geologically sensitive terrain in northern MB and SK were conducted to assess their <b>acidification</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and status. The survey domain (~ 193, 000 km 2) contained 81, 494 lakes ≥ 1 ha in area. Small lakes dominated the inventory in terms of numbers, and large lakes dominated in terms of area. Survey lakes were selected using a stratified-random sampling design in 10 sampling blocks within the overall survey domain. Few lakes had pH < 6, and only three (all in SK) were acidic, i. e., Gran Alkalinity (Alk) < 0 μeq L– 1. A broad range in lake sensitivity was apparent, and very sensitive lakes (low specific conductance, base cations and Alk) were present in all sampling blocks. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was an important constituent of many lakes. Critical loads (CL) of acidity calculated using the Steady-State Water Chemistry model (SSWC) revealed extremely low 5 th percentile values for every block (range 1. 9 to 52. 7 eq ha– 1 y– 1). Block CL exceedances calculated using estimated S and N deposition for 2002 ranged from 54. 5 to 909 eq ha– 1 y– 1. The largest exceedances were for sampling blocks located near smelter sources or downwind of the oil sands. Lake chemistry revealed by our surveys was compared to others conducted both nearby and outside Canada.

40|$|International audienceSulphate {{deposition}} in south-central Ontario declined between 1976 and 2000 {{by more than}} 50 %, whereas lake sulphate (SO 4 2 ?) concentrations decreased by, on average, only half as much. To investigate the factors that controlled this slower than expected response, the temporal patterns in lake SO 4 2 ? concentrations were compared with patterns in both deposition and climate, since climate has {{a major influence on}} the hydrological cycle {{in this part of the}} continent. To do this, the temporal coherence in SO 4 2 ? concentrations between 9 lake basins was estimated using the intraclass correlation from a repeated-measures analysis of variance and two subsets of lakes were found (six in one group, four in the other), each with lakes having synchronous patterns. One subset (4 lakes) included the 3 with the longest water replenishment times (> 3. 4 yr) which are expected to respond to decreases in SO 4 2 ? deposition more slowly. However, the average pattern reflecting the temporal changes of each of the two subsets was very similar. The response of both subsets of lakes to the decreasing SO 4 2 ? deposition over two decades was independent of the degree of <b>acidification</b> or <b>sensitivity</b> to <b>acidification</b> of the lakes. In a determination of which factors best predicted each of those two subsets' SO 4 2 ? time series, good predictive models were produced by regional/global-scale climate indices, specifically the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) describing the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI), as well as by SO 4 2 ? {{deposition in}}dices. When the predictor variables were combined, models which described the long-term changes in lake SO 4 2 ? concentration best included the SOI, the NAOI and SO 4 2 ? deposition. Thus, large-scale climate factors play a major role in determining the response of aquatic systems to changes in SO 4 2 ? deposition, perhaps through their influence on lake and/or catchment processes that effectively delay recovery.

40|$|Geochemical environments, fates, {{and effects}} are modeled for methane {{released}} into seawater by the decomposition of climate-sensitive clathrates. A contemporary global background cycle is first constructed, {{within the framework}} of the Parallel Ocean Program. Input from organics in the upper thermocline is related to oxygen levels, and microbial consumption is parameterized from available rate measurements. Seepage into bottom layers is then superimposed, representing typical seabed fluid flow. The resulting CH{sub 4 } distribution is validated against surface saturation ratios, vertical sections, and slope plume studies. Injections of clathrate-derived methane are explored by distributing a small number of point sources around the Arctic continental shelf, where stocks are extensive and susceptible to instability during the first few decades of global warming. Isolated bottom cells are assigned dissolved gas fluxes from porous-media simulation. Given the present bulk removal pattern, methane does not penetrate far from emission sites. Accumulated effects, however, spread to the regional scale following the modeled current system. Both hypoxification and <b>acidification</b> are documented. <b>Sensitivity</b> studies illustrate a potential for material restrictions to broaden the perturbations, since methanotrophic consumers require nutrients and trace metals. When such factors are considered, methane buildup within the Arctic basin is enhanced. However, freshened polar surface waters act as a barrier to atmospheric transfer, diverting products into the deep return flow. Uncertainties in the logic and calculations are enumerated including those inherent in high-latitude clathrate abundance, buoyant effluent rise through the column, representation of the general circulation, and bacterial growth kinetics...|$|R
40|$|Despite their {{sensitivity}} to climate variability, {{few of the}} abundant sinkhole lakes of Florida {{have been the subject}} of paleolimnological studies to discern patterns of change in aquatic communities and link them to climate drivers. However, deep sinkhole lakes can contain highly resolved paleolimnological records that can be used to track long-term climate variability and its interaction with effects of land-use change. In order to understand how limnological changes were regulated by regional climate variability and further modified by local land-use change in south Florida, we explored diatom assemblage variability over centennial and semi-decadal time scales in an ~ 11, 000 -yr and a ~ 150 -yr sediment core extracted from a 21 -m deep sinkhole lake, Lake Annie, on the protected property of Archbold Biological Station. We linked variance in diatom assemblage structure to changes in water total phosphorus, color, and pH using diatom-based transfer functions. Reconstructions suggest the sinkhole depression contained a small, acidic, oligotrophic pond ~ 11000 – 7000 cal yr BP that gradually deepened to form a humic lake by ~ 4000 cal yr BP, coinciding with the onset of modern precipitation regimes and the stabilization of sea-level indicated by corresponding palynological records. The lake then contained stable, acidophilous planktonic and benthic algal communities for several thousand years. In the early AD 1900 s, that community shifted to one diagnostic of an even lower pH (~ 5. 6), likely resulting from acid precipitation. Further transitions over the past 25 yr reflect recovery from <b>acidification</b> and intensified <b>sensitivity</b> to climate variability caused by enhanced watershed runoff from small drainage ditches dug during the mid-twentieth Century on the surrounding property...|$|R
40|$|Continued oceanic uptake of {{anthropogenic}} CO 2 {{is projected}} to significantly alter the chemistry of the upper oceans {{over the next three}} centuries, with potentially serious consequences for marine ecosystems. Relatively few models have the capability to make projections of ocean acidification, limiting our ability to assess the impacts and probabilities of ocean changes. In this study we examine the ability of Hector v 1. 1, a reduced-form global model, to project changes in the upper ocean carbonate system over the next three centuries, and quantify the model's sensitivity to parametric inputs. Hector is run under prescribed emission pathways from the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and compared to both observations and a suite of Coupled Model Intercomparison (CMIP 5) model outputs. Current observations confirm that ocean acidification is already taking place, and CMIP 5 models project significant changes occurring to 2300. Hector is consistent with the observational record within both the high- (>  55 °) and low-latitude oceans (<  55 °). The model projects low-latitude surface ocean pH to decrease from preindustrial levels of 8. 17 to 7. 77 in 2100, and to 7. 50 in 2300; aragonite saturation levels (Ω Ar) decrease from 4. 1 units to 2. 2 in 2100 and 1. 4 in 2300 under RCP 8. 5. These magnitudes and trends of ocean acidification within Hector are largely consistent with the CMIP 5 model outputs, although we identify some small biases within Hector's carbonate system. Of the parameters tested, changes in [H +] are most sensitive to parameters that directly affect atmospheric CO 2 concentrations – Q 10 (terrestrial respiration temperature response) as well as changes in ocean circulation, while changes in Ω Ar saturation levels are sensitive to changes in ocean salinity and Q 10. We conclude that Hector is a robust tool well suited for rapid ocean <b>acidification</b> projections and <b>sensitivity</b> analyses, and it is capable of emulating both current observations and large-scale climate models under multiple emission pathways...|$|R
40|$|Anthropogenic {{climate change}} confronts marine organisms with rapid trends of {{concomitant}} warming and CO 2 induced ocean acidification. The survival {{and distribution of}} species partly depend {{on their ability to}} exploit their physiological plasticity during acclimatization. Therefore, in laboratory studies the effects of simulated future ocean acidification on thermal tolerance, energy metabolism and acid-base regulation capacity of the North Sea population of the blue mussel Mytilus edulis were examined. Following one month of pre-acclimation to 10 °C and control CO 2 levels, mussels were exposed for two weeks to control and projected oceanic CO 2 levels (390, 750 and 1120 µatm) before being subjected to a stepwise warming protocol between 10 °C and 31 °C (+ 3 °C each night). Oxygen consumption and heart rates, anaerobic metabolite levels and haemolymph acid-base status were determined at each temperature. CO 2 exposure left oxygen consumption rate unchanged at acclimation temperature but caused a somewhat stronger increase during acute warming and thus mildly higher Q 10 -values than seen in controls. Interestingly, the thermally induced limitation of oxygen consumption rate set in earlier in normocapnic than in hypercapnic (1120 µatm CO 2) mussels (25. 2 °C vs. 28. 8 °C), likely due to an onset of metabolic depression in the control group following warming. However, the temperature induced increase in heart rate became limited above 25 °C in both groups indicating an unchanged pejus temperature regardless of CO 2 treatment. An upper critical temperature was reached above 28 °C in both treatments indicated by the accumulation of anaerobic metabolites in the mantle tissue, paralleled by a strong increase in haemolymph PCO 2 at 31 °C. Ocean acidification caused a decrease in haemolymph pH. The extracellular acidosis remained largely uncompensated despite some bicarbonate accumulation. In all treatments animals developed a progressive warming-induced extracellular acidosis. A stronger pH drop at around 25 °C was followed by stagnating heart rates. However, normocapnic mussels enhanced bicarbonate accumulation at the critical limit, a strategy no longer available to hypercapnic mussels. In conclusion, CO 2 has small effects on the response patterns of mussels to warming, leaving thermal thresholds largely unaffected. High resilience of adult North Sea mussels to future ocean <b>acidification</b> indicates that <b>sensitivity</b> to thermal stress is more relevant in shaping the response to future climate change...|$|R
