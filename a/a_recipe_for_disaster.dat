John Pike, space policy director for the Federation of American Scientists, commented that [...] "the Kraft report is <b>a</b> <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> <b>disaster.</b> They are basically saying dismantle the safety and quality assurance mechanisms set in place after the Challenger accident." [...] NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel also took issue with the report, saying in May 1995 that [...] "the assumption that the Space Shuttle systems are now 'mature' smacks of a complacency which may lead to serious mishaps." [...] Nonetheless, NASA accepted the recommendations of the report, and in November 1995, responsibility for shuttle operations was turned over to the United Space Alliance.|$|E
2500|$|The series did {{not start}} well for the Rangers in western New York. [...] Despite playing a {{scoreless}} first period, the key development in the first twenty minutes was a knee injury suffered by Ranger defenseman Michal Rozsival. [...] Rozsival would see the ice for two shifts {{in the second period}} but could not stay in the game. [...] As a result, the Rangers were forced to play the remainder of the game with five defensemen, <b>a</b> <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> <b>disaster</b> against a team as talented offensively as the Sabres. [...] Indeed, the result was a disaster for New York, as the Sabres struck for three goals in four minutes, two coming from the aforementioned Vanek, and Buffalo led 3–0 after two. [...] The Rangers finally beat Ryan Miller halfway through the third period to cut the deficit to 3–1, thanks to a Marcel Hossa tally, but it would not be enough. [...] Three minutes later Jason Pominville was awarded a goal on the first of several controversial video reviews in the series; the controversy in this case coming from the appearance that Pominville had punched the puck into the net. Brendan Shanahan scored a power play goal late for the Rangers to make it 4–2, but Drew Stafford hit the empty net to seal a 5–2 Sabre victory in Game 1.|$|E

50|$|After {{having grown}} by over 50% from 1990 to 1998, Argentina's GDP {{declined}} by 3% in 1999 {{and the country}} entered what became a three-year-long recession.

He inherited a country with high unemployment (15%), lingering recession, and continued high levels of borrowing.

40|$|In 1991 the Argentine Government {{embarked}} on an ambitious exchange rate based stabi-lization (ERBS) program aimed at removing the enticement of using money creation to finance the pervasive fiscal imbalances that have been {{a feature of the}} Argentine economic landscape. Despite the strait-jacket of this program and the early successes achieved, within a decade of its implementation the program collapsed and resulted in the largest debt default in history. This paper analyzes the circumstances leading up to the failure of Argentina’s experiment with this currency board arrangement and the ensuing cur-rency crisis of 2002. In doing so, the paper places this particular episode of exchange rate crisis into the broader context of the three generations of currency crisis models under consideration in the literature. It will be argued that the mixture of unsustainable debt dynamics, an overvalued real exchange rate coupled with labor market rigidities, and the moral hazard presented by the large IMF-supported financial rescue packages provided <b>a</b> <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> economic <b>disaster.</b> Moreover, this debacle provides overwhelming evidence that fiscal profligacy is inconsistent with the maintenance of any fixed exchange rate regime...|$|R

40|$|As Asia {{considers}} greater harmonization {{and integration}} of its financial systems, it would be well-advised to consider the experience of Europe, particularly the eurozone. There are many lessons {{to be drawn from}} Europe about how to implement such integration, mostly negative. It is particularly evident that moving to a currency union had major unanticipated consequences for the ability to manage integration of financial systems within the eurozone. Monetary union sharply reduced the ability of the member states of the eurozone to manage their macroeconomic and macroprudential policies to preserve financial stability. Even setting aside these additional problems created by monetary union, Europe suffered substantial harm from integrating its financial systems so closely in many ways, while simultaneously establishing only very weak coordinating mechanisms among their national financial supervisors. It was also a mistake to forbid the European Central Bank from operating formally as a lender of last resort in a financial crisis. Europe's experiences should not dissuade Asia from seeking appropriate further harmonization and integration.
