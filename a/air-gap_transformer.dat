40|$|Sixth International Conference on Advances in Power System Control, Operation and Management - Proceedings, Hong Kong, 11 - 14 November 2003 Contactless {{transformer}} {{is increasingly}} {{being used in}} new applications of contactless electrical applications. It eliminates the metal electric contact restriction that are required in conventional power conversion. The present research is concentrated on a large <b>air-gap</b> <b>transformer</b> in which the power transfer {{is based on a}} gap-core arrangement. The control of leakage inductance and leakage field for such arrangement is a very challenging research area. In this paper, a model of the transformer controlled by a set of geometrical parameters and the permeability parameters is proposed. Experimental waveforms and simulation of the proposed <b>air-gap</b> <b>transformer</b> are presented. The length of the air-gap is varied from 0 to 1 cm for this examination. Good agreement has been obtained. Department of Electrical EngineeringRefereed conference pape...|$|E

The DC-AC conversion {{is a full}} bridge based on IGBT power modules, and the AC-DC conversion is done via a highÂ  frequency AC link and a first diode bridge. The AC link, which consists of snubbing capacitors and a variable <b>air-gap</b> <b>transformer,</b> is analytically designed to fulfill Zero Voltage commutation requirement. The proposed converter is simulated using PSPICE and a prototype is designed built and tested in the laboratory. PSPICE simulation and experimental results are presented and compared...|$|E

40|$|The {{contactless}} transformer is {{an important}} requirement for industrial applications. It eliminates the metal contact restriction for power conversion. The present research is concentrated on the large <b>air-gapped</b> <b>transformer</b> such that the power transfer is based on such arrangement. The leakage inductance and the leakage field is the challenge. A model of the transformer the experimental waveforms and analysis of a power converter based on the gapped-transformer are presented. The length of air-gapped has been increased to 1 cm and the performance is satisfactory. Design criteria and consideration is also presented and discussed.

40|$|A design {{methodology}} for transformers including integrated and center-tapped structures for LLC resonant converters is proposed. In the LLC resonant converter, the resonant inductor {{in the primary}} side can be merged in the transformer as a leakage inductance. And, {{the absence of the}} secondary filter inductor creates low voltage stress on the secondary rectifiers and is cost-effective. A center-tapped structure of the transformer secondary side is widely used in commercial applications because of its higher efficiency and lower cost than full-bridge structures in the rectifying stages. However, this transformer structure has problems of resonance unbalance and transformer inefficiency caused by leakage inductance imbalance in the secondary side and the position of the <b>air-gap</b> in the <b>transformer,</b> respectively. In this paper, gain curves and soft-switching conditions are derived by first harmonic approximation (FRA) and operating circuit simulation. In addition, the effects of the transformer including integrated and center-tapped structures are analyzed by new FHA models and simulations to obtain an optimal design. Finally, the effects of the air-gap position are analyzed by an electromagnetic field simulator. The proposed analysis and design are verified by experimental results with a 385 W LLC resonant converter. open 182...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{the demand}} for high-power-density {{converters}} with high efficiency and enhanced reliability has increased considerably. To address this demand, this dissertation introduces several low, medium, and high power converter topologies with high-frequency ac links and soft-switching operation, both with and without galvanic isolation. These converters can be in ac-ac, dc-ac, ac-dc, or dc-dc configurations to transfer power from the utility, energy storage systems, or renewable/alternative energy sources (e. g., photovoltaics, wind, and fuel cells) to stand-alone loads or the utility. The advantages of these topologies include soft switching at turn-on and turn-off of all the semiconductor devices, exclusion of short-life electrolytic capacitors in the link, step-up/down capability, {{and the use of}} a smallsized high-frequency transformer for galvanic isolation. The proposed converters are also able to generate output waveforms with arbitrary amplitude and frequency as well as achieving a high input power factor in the ac-ac and ac-dc configurations. Moreover, some of the introduced topologies have fault-tolerance capability, which may allow the converter to run even with one or more faulty switches. In this case, a partial failure will not result in the converter shutdown, and thus system availability is improved. The high-frequency ac link of the introduced converters is composed of an ac inductor and small ac capacitor. The link inductor is responsible for transferring power, while the link capacitor realizes soft-switching operation. As the link components have low reactive ratings, the converters exhibit fast dynamic responses. The inductor can be replaced by an <b>air-gapped</b> high-frequency <b>transformer</b> to achieve galvanic isolation without the need for any snubber circuits. Due to operation at a high frequency, the link transformer is substantially smaller in size and lower in weight compared to conventional line-frequency isolation transformers. In this work, the proposed power topologies are explained in detail, and their comprehensive analyses are given to reveal their functioning behavior in various working conditions. Simulation and experimental results at different operating points are also presented to verify the effectiveness of the introduced power converters...|$|R
